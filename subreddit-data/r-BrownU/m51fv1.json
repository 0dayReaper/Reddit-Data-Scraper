    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI\u2019ve already spent almost two years as a brown student (I\u2019m a sophomore) and I still feel like I have no friends. \n\nFirst semester of freshman year was pretty great. I joined clubs, and had a few people I would meet up with on the regular.\n\nBut then second semester of freshman year, I kind of self-sabotaged my own social life. It\u2019s really illogical, but I think I started to develop a fear that no one would like me once they got to really know me... and I acted on this fear by basically staying in my dorm room all the time (I just so happened to land a single even though it was my first year. I have no idea how that happened). This led me to completely ghosting the people I had started to get close to in my first semester. In other words, I basically cut off all my relationships... (Looking back, I think I might have been going through an episode of what might be depression and/or anxiety at the time.)\n\nBut that episode could not have come at a worse time... because when the pandemic hit, I had to go into social-distancing without any established friends at brown that I could text or call without feeling like I\u2019m intruding. \n\nFlash forward to now, I\u2019ve almost finished two full semesters of remote learning (i chose to study remotely from home due to other personal/family reasons), and I don\u2019t think I could feel more alienated from the brown social life. \n\nWhat is some advice for making friends at brown remotely? \n\nAlso, now that we only have a ~month left of spring semester, and vaccination efforts in the US are looking optimistic (fingers crossed), I\u2019m starting to worry more about how I\u2019m going to make new friends once I get back on campus. I\u2019m afraid that everybody already has extensive friend groups... What is some advice for making new friends as someone who is not a firstyear?\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your comments... I really, truly appreciate them. I was hesitant to even upload this post, but now I\u2019m very glad that I did, because I think I\u2019ve gained a lot of insight and encouragement from your responses. \n\nI think I\u2019ve come to recognize that making friends certainly is not impossible, but not necessarily \u201cnatural.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s ok to be alone sometimes. In fact, my general impression of every college student having a \u201cpicture perfect friend group\u201d is simply inaccurate. \n\nThat being said, if I do want new friendship(s), I have to be willing to make concerted investments into relationships and not expect them to simply blossom out of the blue... and for me, that means putting myself out there and communicating. \n\nAs someone who\u2019s quite shy and introverted, I\u2019m usually afraid to initiate anything social, but reading everyone\u2019s responses has made me realize that perhaps I don\u2019t need to be so scared. \n\nThanks everybody once again for taking time out of your days to read this long post and write out your responses!",

Definitely don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re falling behind or missing out \u2014 you\u2019re really not. As for making new friends, all I can say is that we absolutely absorbed people into our group throughout sophomore and junior year (and probably would this year, if not for all this!) If you reengage with some clubs and put yourself out there, I promise you you\u2019ll find people! It\u2019s a weird myth that people stop making new friends after freshman year, don\u2019t let it get to you.",

            "comment": "Something that helped me was to really, truly realize that EVERYONE wants more friends. There is not a single person who thinks \"I don't want to meet any more nice people, I wouldn't want anyone else to want to be my friend ever\". It helped me to think about how I would feel if anyone, even someone I didn't feel like I was that close to, texted me and said \"Do you want to meet for a coffee on the main green?\" I'd feel flattered, and appreciate them so much for reaching out to me. So, even though I always thought of myself as super shy and introverted, it helped to think that I could be that person for someone else. And I can absolutely guarantee that especially during pandemic times no one is going to be annoyed if you reach out. Everyone is just as desperate for human interaction, even the people you assume have tons of friends. Frankly, if someone sat out on the main green with a sign that said, \"Lonely? Haven't talked to anyone in-person in weeks? Come chat!\" I bet they'd gather a friendly crowd! Everyone's social life has deteriorated and I know that in the fall everyone will be searching for new friends, so definitely getting involved in clubs again would be a great strategy.",

Chances are they were confused why you stopped hanging out with them. Go take a walk, sit on the green, catch up, if freshman year comes up then just explain what you talked about here. I doubt anyone will reject you, everyone welcomes new friends.",

I guess I don't have any advice or anything, just that you're not alone in feeling alone. Part of me gets scared at myself, because I've gotten so used to being alone that weeks have gone by without me reaching out to anyone. I guess on the bright side, it seems to me that everyone is kind of...more relaxed now ?? Because almost everyone is struggling with that sense of isolation, too, even the people who seem to be well connected. Anyway, stay strong OP.",

            "comment": "I think you're getting good advice on this thread, and I've been out of undergrad for a while so I don't have great advice from that angle.\n\nBut I would strongly urge you to go to the counseling center and talk through this. It sounds like you've \"come back\" from that period of depression, but \"a fear that no one would like me once they got to really know me\" is an EXTREMELY relatable thought process to me, and I found therapy immensely helpful for that. Even if you're over it now, it's probably worthwhile to talk through it with a professional to ensure it doesn't happen again. I *didn't* tackle that feeling in college (I did afterward) and it would have saved me a lot of grief to start therapy earlier.\n\nI think the main thing I can look back on from college is that, while the \"I\u2019m afraid that everybody already has extensive friend groups\" thought makes a lot of sense, it's not true. Your friends you ghosted probably got confused, and maybe worried, but going back with a \"I'm sorry I went out of contact. I was having a rough time\" is pretty likely to mend those bridges if they need mending.\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this, OP. College can be a really isolating time, partly because it doesn't seem like it *should* be isolating. But you did not \"miss the boat\" on college friendship, it'll just take some work again.",

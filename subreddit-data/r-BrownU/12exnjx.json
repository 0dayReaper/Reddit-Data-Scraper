    "postText": "Hey there! I\u2019m a current high school junior interested in going into theater management/arts administration. \n\nWhat is the theater scene like at Brown? Both for student-run and official shows. When I toured Brown the tour guide mentioned something about there being a board of students who you can pitch shows to and get resources and stuff, but she didn\u2019t speak super in-depth about it.\n\nAlso, what is the theater concentration like at Brown? I saw on the website that there was a pretty low number of theater graduates in 2022, but generally is it a good program?",

            "comment": "I'm involved in the theater scene at Brown - it's complicated and I don't know everything but I'll try to give a breakdown.\n\n* Majority of theater on campus is student run. This means that students will pitch ideas to the theater boards on campus. There are 5 big ones, and several other small ones. The big 5 are Ensemble, Shakespeare on the Green, Musical Forum, Brown Opera Productions, and Production Workshop. Each has a different culture and budget - for example SOTG tends to not do musicals, Ensemble had a no-cuts production every year, etc.  The small ones I didn't mention I don't know as well so can't describe them as accurately, but they have very interesting concepts (for example one is a troupe style).\n* The big groups have boards that you can also apply to join if you want to produce theater outside of strict tech/acting/music.\n* TAPS (Theatre Arts and Performance Studies) department is small but currently developing. I heard a rumor that they're trying to make more paths in the concentration so that you can do a path in acting vs. tech, etc. - I don't know if this rumor is true, but I do know someone who's trying to go down more of a tech path. I've heard solid things about the program overall, but I honestly don't know enough to say for sure.\n* TAPS has their own sets of shows throughout the year. These tend to get more support from professors/admin, but the shows tend to be more niche or student-written, both by undergrads or grad students. This isn't a bad thing though! Some shows are really amazing concepts/writing, and you get a lot of institutional support/training. \n* Most TAPS concentrators that I know of double concentrate.\n* I know of at least one person who isn't a TAPS concentrator but is still trying to go into theater management/administration. \n* The TAPS department has a graduate program in conjunction with the Trinity Repertory, so there's a nice overlap between the schools.\n\nI realize that's a lot - feel free to PM me with more questions (though I don't go on Reddit often so I'll try to check lol)",

    "postText": "Hello! I recently got accepted to Brown (yay!) for physics; however, I was accepted into a few other schools as well. I have no idea which one to choose, so I have a few questions about Brown to help me narrow it down:\n\n1, Is is easy to find research opportunities as a freshman? Are the class sizes usually quite small and will I be able to find support from a TA or professor easily if I am struggling with a concept?\n\n2, Is it easy for physics undergrads to get into prestigious physics grad schools after? \n\n3, Is there a lot of rain in Providence? \n\n4, Are there any single person dorms or do most people have a roommate?\n\nFinally, how are the dining halls on campus? Is the food good? Are undergrads all on a specific meal plan? \n\nThank you very much!",

            "comment": "Not a physics major but ill answer the last few:\n\n3) It rains a normal amount\n\n4) there are singles but they are tough to get as a freshman.  Housing is a lottery system so unless you can write some medical reason for needing a single its gonna be luck of the draw\n\n5) A lot of people are neutral or even dislike the food here, but personally it goes pretty hard.  I am genuinely excited to go to the dining halls here every day.  Its by no means perfect, but  very consistent I think.  Thats just me tho.   \n\nFreshmen have the choice between two meal plans (same price) and as you get through the years more (cheaper) options open up",

[https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/careerlab/post\\_grad\\_data/concentration/PHYS](https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/careerlab/post_grad_data/concentration/PHYS) \n\nHopefully this helps a little. Congratulations on your acceptance!",

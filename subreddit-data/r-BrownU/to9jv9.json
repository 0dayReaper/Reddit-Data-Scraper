    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI'm interested in applying for the Ph.D. in computer science at Brown.\n\nLittle about myself.  \nI studied law in Italy, where I also earned a Ph.D.  \nI am currently graduating from Stanford with a master's degree in legal studies.  \nOn the way, I got very interested in computers, and I am considering taking a second Ph.D. in computer science to strengthen my knowledge in this field.  \nI'm interested primarily in programming languages and semantics.  \nI want to ask a couple of questions to someone that studies CS at Brown. It is OK if s/he's not a Ph.D. It would be good for me to understand the academic culture and if Brown appreciates the interdisciplinarity of sciences. However, if anybody can ping me to a CS Ph.D. at Brown, that would be even better.  \nI look forward to hearing any of your answers.  \nI really appreciate any help you can provide!!",

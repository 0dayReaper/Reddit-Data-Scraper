Tournament of Champions.*\n\n*Bolsen, 18, wagered just enough to edge out his competitors in the final round of the Jeopardy! High School Reunion Tournament Thursday night.*\n\n*The Georgia native finished with $35,918 in winnings and received a $100,000 grand prize.*\n\n*\u201cIt feels really good,\u201d Bolsen said. He thanked his middle and high school Quiz Bowl coaches for their guidance over the years. \u201cI owe a lot of this to them.\u201d*\n\n *Bolsen will return to the popular game show this fall for the 2023 Tournament of Champions. He will be the youngest Jeopardy! contestant to ever participate.*\n\n*\u201cIt\u2019s going to be crazy,\u201d Bolsen said. \u201cI think everybody knows that people who go on mega-streaks are really, really good, so I can only hope to do my best against them. We\u2019ll see what they have in store for me.\u201d*\n\n*Bolsen first appeared on Jeopardy! in the 2019 Tournament of Teens, though he didn\u2019t make it past the first round. He was* [*one of 27 former contestants*](https://www.jeopardy.com/contestant-zone/2023/high-school-reunion) *to return to the game show for the High School Reunion Tournament.*",

    "postText": "Hi! I was admitted ED to the class of 2026 yesterday. I am beyond thrilled and excited, and am so happy to have somehow gotten in to my dream school. \n\nBut, I am generally worried about a few things. I have pretty bad social anxiety along with other mental health issues. I haven\u2019t had friends in high school. I\u2019ve had a couple shallow acquaintances, but that\u2019s about it. I\u2019m really worried about how I am going to navigate college socially.\n\nBasically, has anyone here been in my situation? If you have, how did you deal with it? Were you able to make friends and form connections? Is Brown\u2019s campus welcoming to people who might struggle socially?",

            "comment": "When I came to Brown I was in a similar situation. Didn't know anyone else in the North East, bad social anxiety. Had a very hard time making friends in my first weeks at Brown. But joining clubs really did make a huge difference. If you find something you can get really involved in, like the Debate Team (what I did), you will find yourself surrounded by extroverts whose job it basically is to befriend you. Like, I know that's not super helpful, because it can be scary to force yourself to go to extracurricular group events, but if you're able to physically put yourself in those spaces I think you will encounter people willing to put in the effort to get to know you. Especially since you presumably share a mutual interest, otherwise you wouldn't be in the same club. \n\nIDK how Covid will affect things - I pray that the world is closer to normal by the time you get to Brown - but presumably there are Zoom events as well if need be. \n\nI won't lie to you and tell you it will be easy. Moving somewhere new with social anxiety is not fun. But Brown is an amazing place full of incredible academic opprotunities and amazing people who would be happy to get to know you. Best of luck.",

It\u2019s so easy to spend days on days in your dorm especially when classes start to pick up but it\u2019s just as easy to go out and be welcomed. There\u2019s always plenty to do and you\u2019ll almost never regret going to a school sponsored event hosted by a club or more casual social event it\u2019s just a matter of taking the step to accept invites. As an introvert it\u2019s easy to say \u201cthat\u2019s not my scene\u201d and be a month into classes knowing absolutely nobody but it\u2019s never too late to make an effort to step outside of your comfort zone and meet others. You\u2019ll find people aren\u2019t so intimidating here! And if I could leave you with one piece of advice, don\u2019t bother with trying to get to know people on social media before arriving on campus if that\u2019s not your thing, there\u2019s plenty time for that during orientation, I would focus on living up your last high school summer. Congrats on the next 4!",

I did this a lot, so I have these little different clusters of friends- from pre-orientation, my dance troupes, some classes where we made study groups to struggle through homework together, I made a lot of friends through friends too, at a few social events (festivities, socials), on my dorm floor, and one friend group was literally made under a lamppost on the sidewalk where I just randomly joined a conversation with, which eventually lasted for 2 more hours into the night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBottom line: don't stay in your room too much, get out n about, join clubs that interest you, and put effort to meet up (get a meal, watch a movie, go thrifting/shopping, etc. whatever) and spend time with people you feel you vibe with or you'll just end up with a shallow \"hi-bye friendships\" :)) Good luck! and congrats on getting in :)",

Like every other college, there\u2019s going to be your typical first year friend groups, drama, etc. but 99% of people are welcoming, so genuine, and considerate. The upperclassmen in the clubs I joined went out of their way to reassure and reach out to me. I struggle with social anxiety and I\u2019m not the most comfortable around substance use, but the chill culture makes it easy to find your boundaries and extend your comfort zone at your own pace.",

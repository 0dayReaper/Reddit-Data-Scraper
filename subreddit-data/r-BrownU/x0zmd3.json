            "comment": "I want to reiterate the importance of the fan! Those dorms don\u2019t have AC (unless you\u2019re in wellness but first-years aren\u2019t). Another good item is an air diffuser/plug-in air freshener. I\u2019m under the impression we still get an air purifier, but trust me, you don\u2019t want your dorm to stink (my first-year roommate was\u2026messy). I wouldn\u2019t worry that much about decorations at this point unless you have a couple of items you already want because there will be many opportunities to buy various posters on campus (good quality), and if you do the training, you could print out custom posters in the multimedia lab. I wouldn\u2019t buy the plastic bins for storage because they take up a lot of space at the end of year when you\u2019re packing for storage. I would suggest collapsible storage, like those that have a felt like texture. I personally have never needed more storage than Brown provides (mainly because I travel across the country), but people bring different amounts of stuff. \n\nOne bit of advice is don\u2019t try to feel pressured to do things you\u2019re not ready to. I\u2019ve had friends who partied hard and regretted it, and others who party constantly and somehow maintain perfect control of their classes. I personally just party once in a while. I prioritize other bonding experiences like watching movies or going skating. Trust me, even though it sometimes feels like it, the party culture at Brown isn\u2019t the only way to have fun.",

            "comment": "I did a pre-orientation program, so a lot of my first 2 weeks was just moving from location to location with people talking at me. When classes started, it was pretty hard to adjust to the way college classes are compared to highschool. Many mistakes were made. Try to plan as much as you can. You won't be able to plan out your time that well on account of not REALLY knowing what's  about to happen, but the less you leave unplanned, the more potential you have to waste your time and not manage your classes well. I would much rather have over performed and had less fun than under perform and have to play catch up later.\n\nI don't recall going to parties much early on as a freshman. Actually not much at all after that... \n\nAs for an unexpected item, I think a good fan will go a long way. I don't sleep much (not because of work don't be so worried about that), but when I do, it has to be good, so having a fan in my dorm to make the temperature just right was really important for me.\n\nI just had the thought that the classes you plan to take probably play a big role in your 2 weeks. I was doing comp sci + music + Russian. Languages meet every day of the week I'm pretty sure, which contributed a lot to my poor performance in my first semester.",

    "postText": "\"For these reasons, we have made the very difficult decision to move academic instruction for all undergraduate and graduate students to remote learning effective Monday, March 30.\n\nUndergraduate students who live in on-campus residences or Brown-owned properties must vacate their residences as soon as possible and no later than **Sunday, March 22**, and complete the semester from their homes or at an alternate location away from campus. Exceptions will be made for undergraduate students whose circumstances would prevent them from leaving campus due to international travel restrictions or other extraordinary circumstances.\n\nClasses will be cancelled during the week of March 16 so that faculty have time to prepare to transition courses to remote learning, and students have time to pack and arrange for travel. Reading week will be devoted to making up the missed week of classes, and faculty can plan to teach during that period. These changes do not apply to most students in the Warren Alpert Medical School, which will communicate any changes or restrictions directly to medical students.\"",

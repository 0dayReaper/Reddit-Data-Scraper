    "postText": "I am on 50/50 on choosing between Brown and UPenn for undergraduate neuroscience as a premed. \n\n81% of applicants from Brown get into medical school, with 29% getting into a T25 medical school. Brown has grade inflation, the Open Curriculum, and a collaborative atmosphere. There aren't great medical centers within walking distance, and Providence isn't a thriving city. Everyone, including premeds, seems pretty happy here.\n\n72% of applicants from UPenn get into medical school, with 42% getting into a T25 medical school.                      UPenn has slight grade deflation, Pre-Professional emphasis, and a more cutthroat atmosphere. There are great medical centers within walking distance, and Philadelphia is a great city. Although Brown may have better outcomes for placement into medical school, UPenn is better ranked overall and for the major.\n\nWhat would you recommend choosing and why? Thanks!",

            "comment": "At the end of the day, statistics can never show you the full picture. If matriculating to a top tier medical school is important to you, you\u2019ll be able to do it from either of these schools. Honestly, you can do it from any school since it\u2019s all about what you make of the experience and the opportunities you make for yourself. \n\nI personally believe that people do their best when they pursue something they are 100% interested in and passionate about. That\u2019s why I chose Brown since you\u2019re given more flexibility in what you study and therefore you can find what you\u2019re interested in and pursue it. I also really, really appreciate how grades are not emphasized here, especially for premed, not because it \u201clooks better\u201d on an application but because education is hard and requires you to make mistakes. Whether you get an A or an A- in organic chemistry isn\u2019t going to make you a better or worse doctor. \n\nI\u2019d recommend thinking to yourself about what you find important (not what your friends, teachers, parents, etc. think is important) and make your decision based on that. Best of luck with the choice and congrats on deciding to pursue further education!",

It boils down to Open Curriculum and the lax approach to academics that have given me an incredible amount of time to do other things beside school. Feel free to pm me for more details as I don\u2019t want to put too many details out in the open.",

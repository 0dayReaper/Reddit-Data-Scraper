    "postText": "Hey all!\n\nI'm an incoming freshman, class of '27, who's been feeling somewhat depressed recently. My whole life, I've sort of viewed college as a goal, not a destination, and now that I am actually accepted and going to attend Brown, it feels sort of ... hazy and unreal. But, I had a talk with my family, and I want to try and get excited about my future at Brown.\n\nSo, for current students ... what's your favorite thing about Brown? What are you favorite places to eat, activities, traditions, clubs, etc? What's the student body like? Are people generally nice / down to earth? What's your favorite Brown memory? What's something at Brown that you feel like you couldn't get at any other college?\n\nThis probably sounds super cringy, and I might regret this post later, but I would just love any little details or things about Brown that could help me picture my future there. Any help or guidance is greatly, greatly appreciated! Thank you so much!\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for all the kind responses everyone! I am still not certain of my future, but I don't have to have it all figured out, and if this subreddit is an indication of the student body at Brown I think I'll have a great time there :)",

I would try to embrace your current situation as best as you can (incl. slacking off in class, spending more time on things you enjoy/people you like). \n\nI say this as someone who fucks w brown heavy (like fr fr) and have family / spent time in WV too. It\u2019s not perfect, and you will struggle. It\u2019s a very unique place in that you\u2019ll likely never be around a more tolerant and accepting collection of people ever, and you\u2019ll make lifelong friends and grow a ton.\n\nTldr; focus on your present, tomorrow is never promised. Brown can\u2019t wait to have you :)",

So, while the time on campus and the things to do/think about are many (and are important), keep in your mind, somewhere tucked away for future reference, the fact that you will not be able to see a lot of what is great about Brown until long after you have graduated and moved on in life. Good luck, and congrats!",

My son is also class of \u201827, and we live in KY. He\u2019s going to ADOCH next month, and I hope it\u2019ll be helpful for him, as he also doesn\u2019t have a real feel for what student life is like at Brown. It\u2019s tough- even if you toured campus, you weren\u2019t allowed to go inside any buildings or see dorms. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love it once you get there- and there will be plenty of students, like my son, who don\u2019t know a soul and will be glad to meet someone from (somewhat) nearby!",

Also, you will be surrounded by very smart, passionate, and considerate people. Remember to enjoy the campus when it is nice outside, the campus is lovely. Take your time to meet new people. Go out of your way to have unique experiences. Attend talks and events that happen on campus all the time (read the today@brown bulletin that comes to your email address every night). Explore all the weird buildings on Brown Campus. Do not worry, you will miss out on things and be burnt out at times, it is what it is, you are independent now: you will learn to lead your life. Open curriculum is amazing, but make sure to be a bit conservative (like, do not shop more than 8 courses) with how many courses you are shopping in the shopping period (the first two weeks of classes when you can show up to any class) because the classes are going full speed and will have assignments due etc. especially after the 2nd lecture. Hmu if you have other questions (especially about engineering or economics)",

Try to leave your bubble if you're anything like I was and be prepared to make the most of your 4 years. Don't restrict yourself to campus and try to explore the city.

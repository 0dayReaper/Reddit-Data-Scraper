    "postText": "Hi, I'm currently preparing my Brown application, I'd love to know if the school offers a major in particular (other than CS! Not because I dislike coding, but because of competition) that would be particularly suitable for a career in quant finance (and the tech industry as a backup, SWE or managerial positions). I'd like a STEM undergrad, am planning to go to grad school, am good at math. ECs/student profile are also STEM oriented.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nP.S. Any CS + X or interdisciplinary majors?",

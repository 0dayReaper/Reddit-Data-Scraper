The professor was very understanding that many people had no prior experience with the program we used and took the class slow, and made all the assignments incredibly detailed and easy so that everyone could succeed. Awesome final project too where you get to do any research question you want using the software. I would definitely recommend taking it for fun!",

This semester she\u2019s teaching intro to ethnic studies and contemporary indigenous education- both I\u2019ve taken with her. She has a great syllabus and fulfilling end of year projects.",

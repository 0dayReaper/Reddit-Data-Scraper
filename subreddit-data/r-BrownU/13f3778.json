    "postText": "hi all! i was admitted to brown as a sophomore transfer yesterday and i'm planning to concentrate in neuroscience (premed btw). i have some questions about brown and i was wondering if anyone could give me some advice before i commit.  \n\n\n1. since brown students start orgo in the spring, would it be very overwhelming to take organic chemistry over the summer so that i can stay on track to complete the chem sequence next year?\n2. is it realistic to take the physics sequence in sophomore year in conjunction with organic chemistry and the neuroscience core courses (i already have ap credit for biology)\n3. in general, what's the premed culture like here (collaborative vs. cutthroat)?\n4. if i'm concentrating in neuroscience, how feasible is it to double concentrate (currently thinking of early modern world but i'm open to other ideas)?\n5. how easy/difficult is it to find research and premed opportunities at brown?\n\nthank you so much in advance!",

            "comment": "Not premed but just know that if you take orgo over the summer, though it would allow you to easily receive an override and jump into orgo 2, you probably wouldn\u2019t receive official transfer credit for it.\n\nAlso, there\u2019s not really a noticeable premed \u201cculture.\u201d I was the only person not premed in my bio lab section, and I\u00f1there wasn\u2019t a noticeable difference between them and other students at brown (smart, ambitious, pretty neurotic about grades). I feel people identify more with their major more than their career aspirations here, and how \u201ccollaborative\u201d students are depends on the department. However, no one is gonna be giving out the wrong answers on the homework just to drop the curve considering most classes at brown don\u2019t have curves",

            "comment": "1: I highly recommend you do **not** take organic chemistry over the summer. This is very frowned upon in medical school admissions as it gives the impression of trying to avoid difficult coursework.\n\n2: I would recommend no more than two lab courses per semester. I would also recommend starting first semester with only two core science courses to avoid overwhelming yourself and getting a low GPA. \n\n3: Very collaborative. No premed course is graded on a curve (i.e. everyone in the class can get an A if they were to do well on exams), so your performance almost solely depends on your own abilities. Helping others therefore does not harm you.\n\n4: I believe neuroscience is one of the hardest concentrations to double. I would advise against double concentrating in this situation, as it also provides no benefit to medical school admissions. Instead, why not just take the courses you want outside of the concentration? You don't have to concentrate in something to take courses in that subject.\n\n5: Very very easy, provided you're proactive and initiate. I started research basically day one (although I was lucky in meeting a wonderful professor and impressing them).",

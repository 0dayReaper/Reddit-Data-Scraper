    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI was admitted to Brown and am in the process of deciding where to go. For context, I'm interested in concentrating in some sort of Applied Math, CS, Econ and going into tech or startups or something, still undecided.\n\nA couple things I was wondering if any students could touch on more would be social life - what does it look like for most ppl, food/housing - some of your favorite and least favorite parts, and overall culture.\n\nThis is what I've gathered from what ppl tell me- pls correct me if I'm wrong: Very Collaborative, nice ppl, strong humanities, pretty happy campus overall - all great things\n\nMy main concerns are about whether Brown will push me enough. I do wish that sometimes I went to a hs with a little bit more pushing and peers that would challenge me- for context went to a very good private school (Brown-like), but not competitive at all, everyone just doing their own thing. How are the student groups in entrepreneurship, tech, and STEM? \n\nI visited this past summer, when campus was empty, so I didn't rlly get a grasp on the environment/culture at all, but what are your guys's thoughts? The biggest thing I'm struggling with is that everyone around me - friends, teachers, parents just talk abt how great Brown is, but Idrk much abt it besides the stereotypes.\n\nAlso, feel free to talk about your own experiences - stuff you like, stuff you don't like\n\nThanks and feel free to ask questions",

Teachers are always available to help you if you need it, but no one's going to hold your hand and encourage you to push further when you don't feel like it. That's true at any university. You get out what you put in. You can get A LOT out of Brown if you put in enough.\n\nFor what it's worth, everyone that I've met and talked with here has been very intelligent and ambitious. I'm Econ, so idk about the tech stuff but the econ undergraduate organization is very active, there are constantly events and speakers coming. \n\nRemember at the end of the day that you are going to be here to make connections for the future.",

You\u2019re able to study and work with friends usually, and when it does come to the weekend folks generally know how to have a good time. I\u2019ve heard from friends at other schools in the city that there can be a bubble and the city makes them more independent and distant with their friends - that\u2019s very much so not the case at Brown. You\u2019re generally pretty close with your friends, and when you do want to go to the city you can take an hour-long train into Boston. \n\nRe Brown pushing you: there will always be grad courses (most always open to undergrads), you can be a TA, take courses in other departments (I\u2019ve been convinced to take esoteric courses by my friends before), and tons of students do research and land internships. You get what you want to take out from your experience here. On the other hand, if you want to take it chill Brown is also a great place for that.",

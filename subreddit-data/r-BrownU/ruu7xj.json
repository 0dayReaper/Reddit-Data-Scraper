            "comment": "I took CS32 last semester (Fall 2021)\nHonestly, it was wonderful as an S/NC class. \n\nIn terms of hourly commitment, there's a clause in the syllabus stating that the recommended amount of work is 12hr/week, and that working more than 18hr/week is *forbidden* (if you reach 18hrs, you're supposed to contact the TAs and let them know that the rest of your work is simply not going to be completed, and that's okay). I ended up working for roughly the recommended 12hrs per week.\n\nI felt like I got a lot out of the course: It helped me fundamentally understand Java and how web development with React worked, which I didn't know before, and also helped me with understanding the dynamics of software engineering. I did a lot of task-delegation in the final project, and without the experience I gained in the first two projects, I wouldn't have been able to effectively lead my group the way I did.\n(e.g. in the first project, we gave one group-member the task of testing everyone else's code: we later realized that it's much easier for each individual to write unit tests for their own code, which is what I did on later projects).\n\nThe prof (Tim Nelson) was very understanding and sensitive to mental health concerns and student wellbeing, and since the course was S/NC it allowed for greater focus on learning the software engineering process, rather than a rush to complete the projects to a 100% bug-free state\n\nOverall, I would absolutely recommend the class if you're a CS concentrator or planning on working in a software-engineering context in the future. If the class is offered as A/B/C instead of mandatory S/NC, I would still recommend taking it S/NC.",

            "comment": "I would\u2019ve liked to see more structured feedback, even though it was pass fail. The feedback was mostly on development charts with certain categories that TAs would fill out. (OOP, Testing, etc) I would\u2019ve preferred to keep autograder/gradescope as a quantitative benchmark, even if the grade didn\u2019t matter.\n\nI\u2019m also not sure if this was a problem exaggerated by how difficult it was to fail, or just the group project nature of the class, but in two of my groups there was one person who did not write a line of code/actively avoided work.\n\nIt was definitely a course where you get what you put into it, given how flexible you could be with time you put in. Hourly commitment could range from 6-12 hrs/week.",

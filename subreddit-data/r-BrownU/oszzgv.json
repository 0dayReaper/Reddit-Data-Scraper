I have a friend who's art + CS, and she's not super happy about the art dept, especially regarding the scope of classes offered. \n\nIt's possible Brown doesn't prioritze art that much because of RISD. \n\nI'm not an art student tho; to be transparent",

As an art concentrator (if you were one) did you have to participate in the lottery to take the most basic art class that is a prerequisite for the rest? I'm worried that process might be a pain. \n\nAlso how is Ms. Tarentino as a teacher, her work is cool.",

There is the possibility of taking RISD classes too. It also may require some effort to get into classes if you aren\u2019t a concentrator but just takes some determination.",

            "comment": "They\u2019re alright. I took a few art classes because I wanted to be a VISA major, but overall Brown art classes are less about developing technique and more theoretical. For example, a surprising amount of reading and writing short responses. This depends on your professor, though, and I can\u2019t say all classes are like this (at least the intro ones probably are). If you want to beef up your technical skills I recommend trying to take RISD courses. And yea, there aren\u2019t all that many art courses overall. Art is not really Brown\u2019s strong suit, esp. compared to RISD nearby.",

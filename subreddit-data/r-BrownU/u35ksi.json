    "postText": "Good evening! After getting the mods approval, I decided to make this post. I was waitlisted by Brown University and it\u2019s my #1 choice, should I be given the chance to attend. Everything at brown interests me, from the curriculum to the literal campus. I\u2019m looking for a student to chat with over zoom or any other digital platform of preference about their experience at brown, what they consider the best elements and some other things regarding their general feel of the college. The information would go towards a Letter Of Continued Interest that I\u2019m writing and I feel this would really give me a boost in what I could provide and eventually write. I\u2019m interested in Behavioral Decision Sciences (neuroscience but the social aspect of it) and Linguistics, so it\u2019d be cool if you have an interest in it or have done research at brown (which is something I\u2019m looking forward to). If anyone is available, please leave me a comment or a DM. Would deeply appreciate it. Thank you! \nTldr: looking for a student to chat with in order to make a better LOCI.",

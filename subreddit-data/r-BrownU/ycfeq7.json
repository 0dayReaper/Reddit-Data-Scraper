There's a Salvation Army there that is (was?) quite large and they had tons of furniture from estate sales. \n\nWe furnished our great Armory District apartment with great, modern furniture for about $200. Retail would have cost 5-10 times that (by my reckoning). See if it's still there.\n\nThey had clothes and all the usual fare but we just went for furniture.\n\nIt was an absolute bitch getting that stuff back to PVD in a Honda Civic and a Toyota Corolla.\n\nGood Luck.",

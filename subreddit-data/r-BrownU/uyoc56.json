    "postText": "Hi! I'm looking for 1 roommate in a 3 bed 1 bath apartment at 343 Thayer St for the summer (June 1 - September 1). Rent is $800 and negotiable! This includes utility, furnishing, in-unit laundry, and a great location near CVS, Insomnia, and the Nelson Fitness Center. Please let me know if you are interested or if you have any friends still searching for a place to stay (the time period is also negotiable if you are  arriving later than June 1)! Roommates would be male-identifying.",

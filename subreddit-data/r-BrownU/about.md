Description:

A place to discuss all things Brown University, the Ivy League institution in Providence, Rhode Island.

Rules:

No "chance me"/admission question/"read my essay" posts: If you have an admissions-related question, you must ask it as a comment in the stickied thread. We recommend that you first talk to the [admissions office](https://www.brown.edu/admission/undergraduate/contact-admission-office), or go to [/r/ChanceMe](https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/). This isn't the place for admissions stuff.

Please don't ask redundant questions: Use the search bar before you post a question. Questions like 

***"What is the open curriculum?"*** 

have been asked and answered ad infinitum. Use a search engine. Why not try asking something more specific, like 

***"How does the open curriculum affect me if I'm a Brown-RISD dual degree student?"***

Please be respectful: Follow the [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) and be respectful. Everyone has different opinions and backgrounds, but please exercise empathy and respect identities. 

No racism, homophobia, transphobia, or ableism: Comments that are racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or classist will be removed at the moderators' discretion. Using alternate spellings to circumvent this rule also counts as a violation.

Posts must be Brown-related: If you're not sure if your post is related to Brown, message the mods first.

re: survey spam â€” Please stop including us in that Google Form survey you've already spammed across hundreds of college subreddits. It gets in the way of actual discussion about Brown ongoings. It's time consuming for the mods to verify whether all these startups are legit, or whether you're just scamming people's personal info. Please message the mods first for permission to post off-topic things. Thanks in advance!

Post one-off questions in weekly megathread: Please post one-off or simple questions in the weekly megathread, rather than creating a new post. Otherwise, the subreddit gets clogged with lots of quick questions.

    "postText": "I am not a student at Brown. I want to learn CS and programming. So, I was surfing through the introductory courses at several universities. That is when I came across the interesting course CS19 which is quite different from what generally constitutes a CS101 at most universities.\n\nI came to know about HtDP, PAPL and now DCIC. I followed Shriram Krishnamurthi on Twitter and his activities. He has a totally different take on how to teach CS to undergrads. At the moment he is churning out a new version of PLAI.\n\nSo I am asking this. Is it a good point if I start my journey with the material available from CS19? Or would I miss something from other standard courses? \n\nPeople at Brown, who have taken this course:\n\n1. What did you like/dislike about this course?\n2. What did you come out with after taking this course? Did it make programming and future courses easier for you? (I know nobody becomes an expert developer with intro to cs course, asking for what kind of skill it teaches you). Did it make you less capable when you are bound to use OOP or imperative style programming for some projects that require it?\n3. Why choose this over other choices?\n4. Is reading the entire HtDP before doing CS19 worth it?",

            "comment": "You can start with HtDP, and I think it's an excellent choice to learn basic data structures and algorithms. I wouldn't equate it with CS19. HtDP is definitely a core part of CS19, but so are the internal unit testing framework that the course staff developed and the projects with their starter code. You won't be able to 'take' CS19 if you're not a Brown undergrad with access to the network.\n\nWhile I would definitely recommend CS19 to incoming freshmen at Brown, you said you aren't a student at Brown. The best intro course to CS for you will be the one with the most resources to learn from. There are plenty of high-quality intro courses with video lectures and projects to learn with. I personally recommend Princeton's Algorithms class on Coursera.",

            "comment": "Hello!! I also had this question at one point, so I'll throw you a bone.\n\nFirst off, if you're an incoming first-year, welcome to Brown! :)\n\nAs you probably know, there are four possible intro CS sequences at Brown: CS 11, 15, 17, and 19. If you dig around this sub or Critical Review enough, you can find good info on the latter three, so I'll focus on the one I took!\n\nI took CS11 with Kathi as a \"non-major.\" Prior to the course, my only experience with coding was an introductory MATLAB course equivalent of APMA 0160, and overall I thought the course was *okay* relative to other courses I've taken during my two years of college.\n\nThe \"motivator\" of the course is manipulating and cleaning data, an incredible skill to have in any career field. That said, the focus of the course is the same as any other intro CS course.\n\nLike those in CS17, you'll learn the basics of trees, recursion, data types, etc., but not in the depth of the said course. Most of CS11 was taught using a functional programming language called Pyret, which is used strictly in educational settings. I personally found the language very fun but also a pain in the ass considering my MATLAB background. You'll also spend the last week or two doing the same thing you learned in Pyret but in Python (to demonstrate how concepts remain the same across languages).\n\nThe course is structured most similarly to CS17 with homework every week and a few exams but with a lot less work. There are only two (kinda 3?) projects that demanded only about half the work my CS17 and CS15 friends had to go through.\n\nThe course is awesome if you just want a taste of CS as it is the least time consuming of the four intro sequences (unless you do the bridge that lets you skip to CS18/CS20 instead of doing CS12). It is also the most generous with grading as far as homework is concerned, and an \"A\" is very achievable for those with little experience. However, don't let this discourage you from picking other intro courses as your first course in CS. I know it's common for a lot of \"non-majors\" to take CS15 their first semester at Brown, love it, and end up majoring in it down the road, so choose the course with the best flavor (and also how much time you have in your schedule).\n\nI just want to say that *none* of the intro CS courses are strictly meant for CS majors. Intro courses at Brown (Principles of Econ, Geo 22, Bio 200, etc.) are all intended for exploration as you take advantage of the sacred open curriculum (cue spotlight). Take whichever you think sounds interesting! Just know that CS17 and CS19 generally require the most man-hours of the four.\n\nI hope this helps!",

Just wanna add that if you're interested in a career where coding skills might be useful, this course will build a really solid foundation upon which you can develop more \"relevant\" skills. I'm not a CS major but my research is highly computational and taking CS 111 made the transition to this work significantly easier",

I recommend this format; it makes desk space a bit more cramped, but it's easier to work around. You can also make 3 rows of beds, but this is not ideal. It ends up being really claustrophobic.\n\nI personally never saw anyone with bunked beds. You should talk to your roommates about it in person",

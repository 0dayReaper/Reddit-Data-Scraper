Example: concentrating in CS, History, and Psych. Assuming all three departments allow an overlap of 2 courses, and I have courses A, B, C, D, E, and F. Would I be able to double count A &amp; B for CS/History, C&amp;D for CS/Psych, and E&amp;F for History/Pysch? Or would I only be able to double count two courses in total for all three majors?",

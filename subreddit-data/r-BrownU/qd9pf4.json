Could any current/graduated physics students give me some information on how the professors are, how easy it is to get research experience, and grad school placements?",

            "comment": "I can give you my perspective as a former grad student in this department. I thoroughly enjoyed it, the faculty and students (both undergrad and grad) were pretty awesome. We had plenty of undergrads pass through our lab where they were able to get some mentorship, research experience, and getting their name on some peer reviewed papers, so the opportunities are there. From what I saw for grad placements they were quite exceptional. That could also be a bit biased because students that were more likely to join a lab had better outcomes.",

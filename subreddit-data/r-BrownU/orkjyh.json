I've recently discovered that I will have to relet my off-campus lease for the next few semesters; in order to do so, I need to find another student interested in leasing the property for the next few semesters. Is there some form of Brown social platform (apart from this Reddit) that would be ideal to find people interested in subleasing this off-campus location?",

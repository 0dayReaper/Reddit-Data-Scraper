    "postText": "hey guys, since the semester is almost over: if you have some dorm supplies or textbooks you don't need anymore, you can list all in College Souk.\n\nI've been working on this app for a while on my own [collegesouk.com](https://collegesouk.com/) / [instagram.com/collegesouk](https://instagram.com/collegesouk)\n\nIt's a free marketplace restricted to students \u2014 once you log in with your user@brown.edu email you'll see listings from peers on the Brown campus only. \n\nThere are also housings and ride sharing so if you want to sublet for the summer you can also check it out.. I'm currently on adding services section as well so it's gonna be a place for finding a tutor as well.\n\nI want it to be like a bubble with everything students need, hope you find it helpful. As a broke student myself I wanted to develop something that can help reduce expenses during these 4 years \ud83e\udd0e(upvote for visibility! more ppl means more cheap items for students)",

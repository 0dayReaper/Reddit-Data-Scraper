            "comment": "Here is an analysis on the meal plan choices that was posted on the Brown parent FB page:\n\n\u201cI see a lot of people saying their kids liked the flex plan (Flex 460 is what is available for first-years), but when I compare that to the only other option for first years (the 20 weekly), it seems like the 20/weekly is the better deal (both plans are the same cost). With Flex 460 you get 230 meal swipes vs axp 300 meal swipes with the 20/wk (understanding that these meals don\u2019t roll over each week). And in exchange for giving up 70 meal swipes you only get an extra $150 in flex points. Given that meal swipes can get a cash value at the cafes, etc.., it seems like they basically can use the swipes as flex cash lots of times.\u201d",

I knew a guy who was on it sophomore year who ended up using all of them long before the semester ended. While the 20 weekly plan limits how many swipes you can do in a day - which can be a bit annoying- at the very least you won\u2019t accidentally run out. Also, 2 of Brown\u2019s 4 dining halls are buffets, and people frequently load up containers and just store them in their dorm",

With my incoming first year daughter who is a planner, I was concerned she would be hungry but choose not to get food to ensure she had enough for the semester. She isn\u2019t a breakfast eater, but I think she will do lunch, dinner and maybe a late night snack. Worst case is a swipe goes unused or she uses a swipe to grab snacks for her dorm.",

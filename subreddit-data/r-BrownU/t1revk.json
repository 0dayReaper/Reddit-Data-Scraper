    "postText": "i\u2019m about to apply to transfer to brown. I go to UCLA and classes are so hard to get into, especially classes outside your major (but inside major is difficult as well). This means that I can\u2019t even declare my major at UCLA until like the middle of my sophomore year because I will not have competed prerequisites because I couldn\u2019t get into the classes I need. I was just wondering if this is also an issue at Brown or if it\u2019s relatively easy to get a spot in most classes. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Really depends on the department. I know that the CS department (and most STEM courses) really value inclusivity and keep courses uncapped for the most part. I also know that VISA intro courses are extremely hard to get into unless you're a VISA major and have connections. You can look through [cab.brown.edu](https://cab.brown.edu) and check what courses/departments you'll mostly be interacting with and whether the courses are capped or not. Plus, you get priority in registration because pre-reg deadlines are different for each class I think. So usually, as you go through Brown, you are more likely to get into classes because you can pre-register earlier too. In my knowledge, this hasn't been \\~too bad for my friends though.",

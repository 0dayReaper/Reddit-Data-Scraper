Grocery stores are somewhat far from campus, and since first years have to pay for the largest meal plan most don\u2019t cook regularly or at all. It\u2019s difficult to justify cooking when you\u2019d be wasting a meal you\u2019ve paid for.\n\nDifferent dorm options and meal plan requirements/options mean that upperclassmen cook more often than first years.",

I used the cafeteria as a grocery store for produce from the salad bar, a few spices, oil, and vinegar, simple proteins, etc. I'd prep breakfast burritos, cottage pie, crunchwraps similar to taco bell, and a multitude of other foods that I'd then offer to other students that had better notes and understanding of the class material in exchange for helping me study. It wasn't always exactly what I wanted or how I'd cook at home, but I could afford it and take advantage of my meal plan.",

Offer to trade someone a swipe or some groceries and you've got a good deal. Don't hesitate to ask! We're nice, and the worst we could say is no. Heck, feel free to pm me here if you want. Also be sure to hang out at the BCSC! There's a little kitchen there and I'm sure you'd be able to find a friend to help you out.",

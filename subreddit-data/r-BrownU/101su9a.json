    "postText": "Hey, everyone. I apologize if this is not the correct place to post this but I've heard differing opinions on this and wanted to get some slight sense of confirmation. \n\nDoes not making a video portfolio hurt your application? I have tried for far too long now and my attempts have been god-awful so far, so I was wondering how considerable a factor it usually is.  I'd like to know because I feel like I might be wasting my time trying to make something that might come off as ingenuine or contrived and I really don't want to seem that way.\n\nEither way, thanks for reading this and I'll gladly welcome any advice you can offer.",

You never know whether applicants who didn\u2019t do and got in were very qualified/legacy/athletes. It never hurts to do one, but make sure that it reflects your personality :) don\u2019t submit it just for submission",

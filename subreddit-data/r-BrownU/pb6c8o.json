    "postText": "How accessible are general stores (e.g. Walmart or the like)? If I wanted to purchase paper, batteries, or hygienic supplies, would I have to hire an uber/ride a bus, or are there stores within a walkable distance? And if riding a bus is the best option, how long would it take? Thanks in advance.",

I\u2019m terrible with distances; or a short bus ride). \n\nEastside Marketplace is also a short bus ride away (or a 10-ish minute walk), and there\u2019s some larger CVS stores only 5-10 minutes away (the one on Thayer is on the smaller side). The Providence Place mall is also a pretty short bus ride or a 15 minute walk away (but that\u2019s like all downhill getting there from College Hill, and uphill coming back, so the bus might be preferable).",

I did have the experience of living on the bottom of the hill (not at Edge though) and let me tell you this: during the snowy and rainy days of Winter and Spring you are really gonna wish you didn't have to climb up Waterman everyday for class.",

Honestly I don't think there's much you wouldn't know from a tour- my room was super small, but I got creative with storage space in the closet, dresser and under the bed. The private bathroom is a huge plus and they're really nice and feel new (or they did 3 years ago). The management team is nice and present. The location is good and I always felt safe walking home from campus because of how well lit Thayer is. The free food occasionally isn't that good, and supposedly there's a gym but I never used it. I'd live there again.",

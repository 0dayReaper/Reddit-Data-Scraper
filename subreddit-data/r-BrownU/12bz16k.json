    "postText": "Hey guys!\nI was recently admitted to Brown for concentration in biomedical engineering. However, I was also admitted to Duke for the same major. Duke is one of the leading institutions for BME and has an amazing program.\nMy heart is with Brown, though. Considering Brown is more geared towards humanities, I am a little concerned with the strength and reputation of the engineering program, as well as research opportunities in this field.\nHere are a couple of related (and unrelated) questions I have about Brown that would help me make my choice easier! If anyone could help me answer these it would be immensely appreciated. If you also have points on why I should choose Brown over Duke, feel free to share!\n\nAre there lots of opportunities for engineering \n/STEM research?\n\nHow does the open curriculum work for engineering concentrators?\n\nI am from a very conservative part of Texas, but I am not myself. My parents on the other hand (very conservative) are concerned that Brown will \u201cbrainwash\u201d me into being a radical leftist. Is this a large part of the culture at brown, so liberal to the point it is flawed? \n\nIs the school congested being in Providence? In fact, how nice is Providence and the campus really? I loved UPenn because it was in the heart of Philly, but when you were on campus it was like a bubble with nature etc.\n\nAre there parts of the campus that are very pretty with nature? One (albeit small) drawing factor of Duke to me is the Duke Gardens. I like to run through nature paths and study in them when possible.\n\nThank you so much! It\u2019s okay if you can only answer one of these questions; any amount of advice is appreciated. &lt;3",

            "comment": "I study electrical engineering at Brown. Research is world class including the professors, many whom have taught at MIT and other stem heavy schools. They pump out research and have various government grants. You will spend a lot of time in stem and engineering classes which do not broach social issues. I think you will experience more of the liberal side of the school in the written courses you take, but speaking personally, it really isn\u2019t that big a deal. The kids here are like kids everywhere, some are more left leaning, but especially as an engineer the only social topic of conversation is generally whether you should work at Tesla or spaceX. \nBiomedical at brown is the best engineering since it can ride next to brown\u2019s incredible medical school. Also, you have one choice and there is something to be said about going Ivy.\nJust my two cents.",

Not really, but if you\u2019re willing to walk five minutes south of campus, there\u2019s this amazing bike path that traces along half the bay. Absolutely beautiful scenery with a lot of richie rich style homes as you pass through Barrington. There\u2019s also this nature trail if you walk 15 minutes northeast of campus. Lastly, the outing club takes people on nature walks around ri every week\n\nI also study engineering at Brown and have answered a couple questions about it in the past two weeks if you want to peek, but u/beautiful-shame3185 gave an excellent answer, and biomed is also by far the largest engineering discipline at brown",

I graduated with a degree in computer engineering and I think I had a really good education that prepared me well for career.  There are many radical leftists at brown, and I can\u2019t promise you wont become more liberal if you come here, in fact you probably will.  How much is up to you and the sorts of people you interact with.  Brown has really good stem stuff, despite the (incorrect) reputation for being a humanities schools.  I will say that as far as nature goes there are a few nice green areas, but nothing like a forest or a field.  It\u2019s very suburban/semi-urban.   There is a nice walk along the river as well, but to really feel like your in nature you\u2019ll probably have to drive a little bit.",

            "comment": "I was in the same position Duke BME vs Brown. Ultimately, I picked Brown because I didn\u2019t like how big the campus was at Duke. It just felt nicer to be able to walk to campus and casually bump into people instead of taking a bus to and from your dorm. I found Brown to be the opposite of brainwashing. My high-school was extremely STEM/engineering oriented and I only ever considered engineering as a career path. I tried the engineering classes in my first year and didn\u2019t hate it (professors were super nice and I had a great mentor!) but ultimately decided to concentrate in CS + History. I encourage you to use the open curriculum to explore things out of your comfort zone and try classes that pique your interest in the shopping period. I will say the history and other humanities classes I took at Brown have really given me a lot of interesting perspectives/lessons in life.",

If your views change, they may not have been the most sound in the first place.

It is a concern of my parents and I was wondering if anyone could attest to something that will ease my mind about their reactions to the move a bit.

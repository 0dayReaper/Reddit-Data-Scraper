You\u2019re going to have to rearrange a fair amount of those required chem classes. To stay on that trajectory, you would need to be taking chem 350 right now (summer 2021 semester)\n\nAlso, now that Chem 400 is back on the menu, I would suggest that over 500 for bio chem/premed. \n\nYou should probably also take Biol 285 at the same time as Biol 280.\n\nEdit: For the person that tried to chat me but I accidentally hit ignore, the bulletin has Prof. Kim teaching Chem 400 this spring https://bulletin.brown.edu/pdf/2021-22-cab.pdf",

There isn\u2019t a real 2 semester sequence here. And if you take 100, you will probably have to wait to take Orgo until spring 2nd year unless you take it over the summer.",

I\u2019m currently a freshman who\u2019s also pursuing biochem as a concentration (premed too) and I too approached it trying to get a head start and trying to double concentrate, but I realized sometimes it\u2019s not always worth it. It\u2019s definitely possible, but you\u2019ll could be closing a lot of opportunities for exploration. I ended up taking chem 330 first and exploring a bit with ENGN 30 and an anthropology course and I\u2019m happy I did as I\u2019m now considering a engineering concentration instead! That\u2019s just my two cents, but try to take advantage of Browns open curriculum as you could find something you enjoy even more. \nBest of luck!",

I am interested in biochem (premed), but I\u2019ve been thinking of a second concentration in Econ or the entrepreneurship certificate because I\u2019m starting a medtech business with a friend of mine from MIT. \n\nI\u2019d like to say I\u2019m of average intelligent (nothing special), so I don\u2019t know how difficult courses will be at Brown for me and if I could handle my theoretical course load. Are any of these proposed plans feasible? Will I die from the stress and workload of these schedules? Am I stupid for wanting to double concentrate? \n\nAny advice, feedback, or information about course difficulty, my academic plan, etc. would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThank you! \ud83d\ude0a",

I look at your schedule and just think good luck \ud83d\ude29\n\nIf you are really committed I would recommend taking the Econ classes all Pass/Fail. I took most of the biochem courses but am not familiar with Econ rigor, but to me a better schedule would be changing all the orange to green, so dropping Econ and just taking easy/fun classes instead. You might also want to consider only doing 3 classes your first semester to be able to have time to adjust to your new environment and course load.",

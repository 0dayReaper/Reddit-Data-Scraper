    "postText": "Hi guys hope you are doing great. A year ago one of your modders was kind enough to allow me share a survey for my undergraduate thesis about representation and access to Ivy League universities and NYU for low-income and students of color. I wanted to tell you thank you so much to all the Brown students who were so generous on sharing their experiences, and I have good news: I got honors! I'm so grateful and happy for graduating with a work that mean a lot for me and for society. If this thesis is so valuable is thanks to all of you! Anyone interested in seeing the results feel free to dm and I'll send it to you, I was able to published in the research platform of my uni :)\n\nI wish I could tell you thank you in a post like this sooner, but as usually happens, life got in the way with tons of stuff, and how the world is, well... :\\] hopefully everything evolucionates everytime more for the better and us youth can get good opportunities, job etc. I do talk a lot so I'll stop right here haha if you ever need the help from a spanish-speaker journalist you can contact me anytime, cheers x",

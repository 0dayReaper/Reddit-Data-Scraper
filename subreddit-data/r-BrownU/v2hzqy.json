    "postText": "i\u2019m an incoming freshman at brown and i was just curious if it\u2019s possible/ how difficult it is to take art classes at brown as a non-concentrator. i took ap art in high school and would definitely be sad to not take an art class again in college, but from my brief research it seems difficult to get into the VISA department\u2019s classes and even harder to take a class at RISD. any advice/ experiences?",

RISD has plenty more studio based courses but Brown has a few if you can fit them into your schedule!\n\nAdditionally, there are a plethora of research based courses you can take as a non-concentrator that shouldn't be too conflicting.",

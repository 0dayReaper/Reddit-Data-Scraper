    "postText": "hello all!\n\ni was planning on taking both cs 15 and math 180 for my freshman year fall semester and was wondering if this is maybe too heavy of a load. i like both classes and want to concentrate in something in the apma department (leaning towards apma-bio).\n\nSome relevant information:\n\n\\- i have no coding experience\n\n\\-5's on both AB calc and BC, as well as a healthy score on Brown's calc placement test\n\n\\-current plan is to take these two classes in addition to a FYS and healthcare in the us (PHP 0310). subject to change of course!\n\ni'm trying to keep a light load for my first semester. i feel like 3 easy/exploratory classes and 1 medium to difficult class is my vision but i could probably also do 2 medium difficulty classes. any advice? also, if anyone with direct experience with these classes can share their overall thoughts? course/professor, etc. thanks!!!",

I biked to classes and around Providence. It really allows you to explore the city easily and you can always just walk the bike up the hill in the RISD to Brown direction which is the worst hill.\n\nYou can check out recycle-a-bike, which may have cheap bike options or keep an eye out on the Brown buying and selling Facebook page",

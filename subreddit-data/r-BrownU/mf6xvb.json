The referendum calls for the University to switch its admission practices to a test-optional policy that would not require applicants to submit SAT or ACT scores.\n\nThe University is not obligated to take action based on a referendum outcome, The Herald [previously reported](https://www.browndailyherald.com/2019/02/28/brown-divest-proposes-referendum-ucs/).",

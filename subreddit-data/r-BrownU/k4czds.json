So what is the goofiest, most no-fricks-given-iest (sorry for the coarse language) thing you have ever seen during your time at Brown? Some good, clean ol\u2019 goofs, gambits, bafoonery, or any fun story would be much appreciated.",

All of the streetlights have outlets on them on the green, so you can plug in a power strip, you're ready to go. As my time at Brown went on, definitely found more people being like \"Whoa what's that big tv??\" and not knowing what a CRT is, which is pretty interesting. Lots of midnights where people who were super drunk would walk by and challenge us, or where you'd meet some really awesome people by connecting over Smash. \n\nNot quite a goofy thing, but more of a fun story -- play games outside everyone!",

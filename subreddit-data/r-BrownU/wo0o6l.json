    "postText": "Hi, I'm an incoming freshman at brown who originally planned to major in economics.\n\nI have recently been interested in CS especially since I feel no special gravitation towards econ nor any other specific majors. Frankly, I also thought I might as well try a field that would not pain me so much when I try to get a job in the US since I am an international student. \n\nDespite my interest, I have no experience in coding, and the highest math course I have taken so far is AP Calculus AB in high school. What's worse is that I didn't think I would need a high AP score so I didn't take the AP test, since my assumed path was distant from anything math related. \n\nI enjoy math, and I'm not terrible at it. But that's also because I've only taken Calc AB so far, right? Is it a bad idea to try computer science at Brown? I would need to take the prerequisite course like Introductory Calculus, Part II. \n\nThanks:)",

            "comment": "Not a CS major, but\u2026 None of the courses in the intro sequence require any calc knowledge or have any official prerequisites (besides the an intro course for CS20 obv).\n\nI see the confusion though\u2026 on Bulletin, it lists MATH 100 as a \u201cprerequisite.\u201d That\u2019s a prerequisite to declaring CS as your concentration, which isn\u2019t done until your second semester of sophomore year. This means you\u2019ll have four whole semesters to take Calc 2, so you are faaaaar from behind.\n\nAlso note that none of the intro courses require any coding experience to start. As a matter of fact, CS11 and CS17 both teach \u201cparadigms\u201d (forgive me CS majors if I\u2019m jacking up the terminology) most students have never seen before, so you wouldn\u2019t be at a disadvantage whatsoever in these.\n\nFrom this point forward, I\u2019d read some old posts on this subreddit and check out Critical Review to see which intro course might interest you: CS11, CS15, CS17, or CS19 (CS19 has a mini summer prereq that\u2019s due pretty soon)\n\nWelcome to Brown, and don\u2019t feel stressed about picking a major just yet!!!",

The intro sequences are designed for people with no background in CS and yet will still be challenging for people with a background in CS.  Any advantage people who did CS in highschool had over you in learning is wiped away after the first few weeks.  And after the intro sequence, everyones pretty much at the same level no matter how they were when the started.\n\nBut of course if you really want to do CS you\u2019re going to have to put work in.  Unfortunately if you didn\u2019t want to put in that much work, some of the classes will still let you get an A.  So you have to really take charge of your education here and make sure you understand what you\u2019re learning, how to do the assignments etc.  Use TA hours!",

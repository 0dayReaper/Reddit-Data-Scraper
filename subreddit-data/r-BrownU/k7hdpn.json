                    "comment": "Nice attempt but you're clearly missing some technical details. Quantum mechanics actually dictates that Brown can't know both where we are and where we aren't at the same time (by the Horacemann uncertainty principle). So the difference these two quantities isn't well defined; convergence isn't implied by monotone lectures even if they're bounded above by 80 minutes. \n\nFurthermore, despite clear deficits in the information ascertation of the underlying ergodic process that is the Brown administration computing your location, it is impossible to transmit that information through a lossless channel with finite energy (which our admin clearly has). You might be thinking of data compaction which is lossless, but obviously three terse lines in an email by CPax once a month can't possibly get any more compact so that mustn't be what they're doing. \n\nLastly, a mathematician would know that algebra is actually the study of groups, so you here are misusing the term algebraic sum. Groups such as Brown University Beekeeping actually sum to more than their parts (mostly because they denied me three years in a row\u2014something to do with me not understanding where the knees are on the bees) don't contribute to this location calculation to which you are referring. Deviation is on the other hand a sexual term not one that will help Brown in finding where we have been; sexual deviance refers precisely to seek erotic gratification via a pathway to many abilities that some consider to be unnatural. \n\nIf you want more help understanding these technical topics in the future, you don't know where to find me.",

Of course, if Brown *is* getting usage logs from Zoom directly, that'll do nothing.\n\nThe technical solution to this problem is to rent a fast VPS, run zoom on that, and stream the video back to yourself.",

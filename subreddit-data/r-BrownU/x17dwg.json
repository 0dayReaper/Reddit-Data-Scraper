    "postText": "Incoming freshman here!\n\nI didn't really take a calculus course in highschool but I'm looking to concentrate in CS.  High level math and calculus somewhat spooks me so I'm motivated to confront the issue immediately so I'm prepared for future math oriented CS classes.\n\nConsidering this, could MATH 0100 be a good fit for me? Or would success without any background calculus experience be unlikely?\n\nI considered brushing up on calc 1 in whatever sparetime I can find and then taking 0100 next semester.  Could this be a smarter alternative? \n\nOr would it be better to take MATH 0090?\n\nAny advice would be beyond appreciated, thank you!!",

            "comment": "Math is one of those subjects where success is depended on having a good grasp on old content. Many Calc 2 topics such as integration and diff eq really depend in having a good understanding of differentiation, for instance. I would, therefore, advise against taking Math 100 without having completed a Calc 1 equivalent, especially since you\u2019ll cover content at a more accelerated pace. [This website](https://www.math.brown.edu/calcplacement/) has more info on calc placement; use this info and talk to advisors to make the best decision",

            "comment": "Speaking as someone who's taught Math 0100 (and will be in the spring), you can't succeed in it without knowing *most* of the content from MATH 0090. Single variable calculus is highly cumulative. If you're able to learn the 0090 content on your own, you can start with 0100, but if you're never taken any calculus, it's a bad idea to assume you'll definitely just be able to pick it up.\n\nWhichever course you start with, make sure to ask questions (in class AND outside of class) about anything you don't understand. A lot of students with math anxiety who take these courses make things harder by assuming they have to fix any points of confusion by working on their own with online videos, but part of the point of taking a course instead of reading about a topic on your own is that you have an instructor and TA assigned specifically helpful... I hope you'll use them when you need to!",

If you're some super powerful math genius, you could probably make it, but having not done any calc, I don't know how one would be conviced thay they're a poweful math genius.",

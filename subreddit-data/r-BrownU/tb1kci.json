With my son, we applied for financial aid.  With my daughter, we did not.  My son did get access to Banner early and was admitted.  So, I think it is a positive sign because you have to wonder if they would go through the financial aid processing for someone who wasn't admitted.  But if you didn't apply for financial aid and don't see Banner it doesn't mean you have been eliminated.  Also, I think I do recall a few people saying they got the Banner access and ended up not getting admitted.  Clear as mud.",

It may not mean that you have been admitted, but I think it means you haven't been eliminated either.  They get about 50K applicants a year and I would expect at least half of those are applying for financial aid.  They are not going to process them all.  Why waste the resources.  They are only going to process the ones that they want to admit.  Good luck and lets us know the results.",

I wouldn't take it as a sign either way.",

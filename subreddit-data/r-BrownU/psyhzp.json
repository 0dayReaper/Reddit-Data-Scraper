    "postText": "Hi all! I am a political science major at Columbia researching grad schools; I am very keen to get into government/public interest. This program caught my eye because time is valuable and ivy league schools have b r a n d  r e c o g n i t i o n.\n\nMy concern stems from a WSJ article attacking Columbia and other top tier grad schools as overpriced cash cows that leave students under a mountain of debt without an increased chance of obtaining strong career prospects commensurate with the amount of money spent. Also, speaking to my university's culture, some of our grad schools feel removed from the center of the community (SPS and TC), some members of the community regard them as not bona fide Columbia. With that said, a few questions for y'all:\n\n1. Is this program legit?\n2. Does it generally produce graduates who land livable wages in their desired career field?\n3. Does the rest of the Brown community look down on it?\n4. If any of the above concerns are based in truth, could you suggest an esteemed one year MPA/MPP program?\n\nTYA!",

            "comment": "hey! I am not an MPA student but I worked in the Watson with the faculty that teaches the MPA courses, and I was a TA for two MPA courses last summer. \n\n1.  Yes, it is legit. \n2. Yes. \n3. Not at all. \n\nIn my experience, I found the program to be quite intense for students since it is so fast-paced. I also found that having an economics background was extremely helpful (the course I TAed was actually an intro econometrics course). Most of the students were either directly out of undergrad (and mostly did their undergrad at Brown) or professionals that had a lot of work experience under their belt and were looking to move up. I will say that Brown\u2019s MPA program is not one of the top rated according to US News or other sites (although still top 50). Whether or not these ratings are meaningful/accurate is debatable. I believe the MPA program offers merit scholarships but I am not sure how common or how large they are. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, I would recommend looking through the Brown MPA site and maybe contacting some of the faculty/current students for their insights.",

            "comment": "Long answer (the part on just Brown\u2019s MPA program is at the end):\n\nTake some time to get to know the different professional degree, public sector programs out there. There are primarily three different forms. \n\nFirst, there is a Master of Public Administration (we\u2019ll call this MPA 1), which the \u201coldest\u201d, more traditional type; Think kind of like a public sector equivalent of an MBA. \n\nSecond there is an a Master of Public Policy (MPP), which gets into a different kind of quantitative analysis of policy, rather than just the financial management of an organization; generally, MPPs are often considered to be more quant heavy than MPA 1\u2019s, but this isn\u2019t always the case. \n\nThird, you have Master of Public Affairs (we\u2019ll call this MPA 2), which is basically a hybrid of the two other programs. \n\nThis categorization, of course, gets all jumbled, as there are programs that call themselves MPPs, but are much more of an MPA 1, etc. which makes rankings extremely difficult to understand, and sometimes pointless. In other words, when deciding on a public sector advanced degree program, you really need to do your homework, and realize, this really is a case of choose the program that best fits your needs! \n\nWith that important caveat, there are some top programs, that if you can get in/pay, will assist you in your career advancement. \n\n1. Princeton School of Public and International Affairs (formally \u201cWoodrow Wilson School of\u2026\u201d). This is an MPA 2, but has been around for a really long time. This is a phenomenal program AND is fully funded. This equation makes it the most competitive to get into and leaves little hope, with an acceptance rate of 6-8/9% depending on the year.\n\n2. Kennedy School of Government. A lot of different programs, but I believe the main one you are looking for is the MPP. The cost is exorbitant, but, because it is Harvard, it is still very competitive and hard to get into.\n\n3. McCourt School of Public Policy (Georgetown). This is a classic MPP, heavier amount of quant. This is a good program, I don\u2019t want to discount it, but the difficulty of getting in is derived from its location and strong connections to DC. Name recognition helps too. Very expensive program with not much help usually! \n\n4. Sanford School of Public Policy (Duke). Classic MPP. They place well with contractors that will often pay back the full cost of one of your two years of tuition. \n\nThese are some top/\u201celite\u201d programs, primarily based on the competitive (low) acceptance rates. You can throw others in here, like SIPA, etc.. There are also other top programs according to rankings that you probably won\u2019t find appealing (not sexy in name like Ivy schools carry), but are phenomenal and much cheaper like SPEA (at Indiana) and Maxwell (at Syracuse).\n\nOne needed clarification are the class sizes of different programs. Often they are broken into two sizes, those with about 150-200 a year and those with 60-80. Each of these provide different opportunities. The larger ones have systematic processes to their programs and consistently bring in stable recruitment; however, they are more of a \u201cmill.\u201d The smaller ones you usually have a more unique program and you build personal relationships with professors, etc.; but sometimes placements are less stable. \n\nLastly, onto Watson MPA 2. Unbiased assessment: Very boutique. It recently, in 2016 went through an identity change, from a 2-year classic MPP program to a 1-year MPA, and has one of the smallest class sizes each year in public sector advance degrees. The program is truly a hybrid. I don\u2019t know if it still does have it, but it was the only program that had a mandatory international study component. Mandatory \u201cconsultancy\u201d that can often lead to a job.\n\nBias assessment: I loved my time in the program. My cohort was a great group of people, they really seem to bring together a specific group (as opposed to the larger programs). The faculty are amazing and all open to talk at any time and do research with. You have a unique group of people\u2014academics and practitioners\u2014in Watson. There are great forums basically every week. The campus is so enjoyable. Brown is a unique place, a special vibe. If you TA, undergrads are very dedicated to learning rather than just trying to get a grade. I look back so soundly on my time there! There is a great data-track they offer if you can prove yourself in the quant summer courses.",

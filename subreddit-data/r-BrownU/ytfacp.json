I got Cs in my first and last physics classes (my major). I still graduated with honors. I still got into multiple PhD programs. The one I attended is a top-15 program in my field. I finished that PhD and went on to do a postdoc in one of the probably top 5 departments for my specific sub-field. I also tried out industry for a year between undergrad and grad school and again after my postdoc, and in both cases had no problem getting multiple offers for good jobs, and definitely nobody cared about the Cs. Now I'm back in a research position in academia. So even with 2 Cs in my major, everything turned out just fine. \n\nDid those Cs probably have some impact on which grad schools I got into? Yeah, probably. But I still got into a good program and was successful there. And as for everything after that point, I don't think those Cs ever mattered ever again in the slightest. \n\nI remember well how freaked out I was about the Cs at the time, so I understand that feeling of dread. But in the long run, it probably won't impact you that much, especially if your other grades are pretty good, and even if it does have some impact on one or two opportunities, you'll sort it out and find something else and a couple years later it'll be so far in the past it won't matter anymore.\n\nETA: I'll emphasize that one of those Cs was in my *first* physics class, my first semester. I stuck it out in the major anyway. Was that smart? I dunno, maybe not. But it worked out in the end and I liked physics so I wanted to ride it out and see if after a hard first semester of catching up to my peers, maybe I could hack it after that. And it turns out I could. The second C was in my first graduate-level physics class (which I took as a senior undergrad). Sometimes you just need a minute to catch up. Doesn't mean you can't catch up or that you're categorically not good at something.",

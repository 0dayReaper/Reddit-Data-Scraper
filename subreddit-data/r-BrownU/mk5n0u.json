    "postText": "Hi folks! If you're reading this as a prospective first-year: first off, congrats on making it to this point in the application cycle and on applying to Brown. My name is Will \u2014\u00a0I\u2019m a reporter with the [Brown Daily Herald](https://www.browndailyherald.com/), Brown's daily student newspaper, covering [admission + aid](https://www.browndailyherald.com/2021/04/01/spontaneous-facetimes-zoom-silences-broken-records-admission-officers-describe-creating-next-years-class-home/). We have a lot of coverage planned for the upcoming weeks as students receive their notifications and make their college decisions.\n\nWith that in mind, I\u2019m aiming to talk to lots of students who applied \u2014\u00a0no matter what decision you receive on Tuesday.  If you think you'll be interested in being interviewed after you receive your decision, please PM me on here, reach out to me via email ([wkubzansky@gmail.com](mailto:wkubzansky@gmail.com)), or on Twitter ([@wkubz](https://twitter.com/wkubz), DMs are open)! I would appreciate it if you reached out before Tuesday so we can get moving on interviews as soon as possible, but feel free to reach out after Tuesday as well!\n\nJust want to be clear about a few things: \n\n1. Communicating with me or the Brown Daily Herald in any fashion will have no impact on your admission decision, your financial aid, or your standing at the University. \n\n2. If you\u2019re concerned about anonymity/the use of your name: for admitted students, we\u2019ve written [this kind of story before](https://www.browndailyherald.com/2020/03/31/midst-covid-19-pandemic-accepted-students-react-admissions-decisions/) without any issue. If you\u2019re waitlisted, we\u2019ll be sure to keep your name private, or we'll wait to publish the story until after you receive a final decision. For students who are denied a spot, we\u2019re also happy to discuss the use of your full name.\n\n3. If you\u2019re under 18 years old by the time we go to print, we\u2019ll need the written consent of a parent to quote you in the story.\n\nBest of luck, everyone!",

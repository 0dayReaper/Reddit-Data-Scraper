If you want to get even more excited about your soon-to-be peers and hear some inside perspectives from Brown students themselves, there's a podcast on Spotify called Show-N-Tell that showcases the depth and variety of students' experiences which make the Brown community so special!

Of course they don\u2019t want to comment on whether or not it will reappear in a more virulent, more deadly form, but it\u2019s not impossible. Still, with our modern medical technology we\u2019re likely better of than the people of 1918. Hopefully. \n\nI do remember in an interview with NBC, the head of the CDC expressed his hope that they wouldn\u2019t have to turn to drastic measures such as shutting down schools. It seems as though everyone is banking on antibody tests and questions of immunity. But it all remains to be seen.",

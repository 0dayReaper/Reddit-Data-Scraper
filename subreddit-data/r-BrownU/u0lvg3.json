    "postText": "This is probably very overambitious, but could someone do the concurrent masters (here [https://cs.brown.edu/degrees/undergrad/extended/#:\\~:text=The%20Concurrent%20Baccalaureate%2FMaster's%20Degree,degree%20and%20a%20Master's%20degree](https://cs.brown.edu/degrees/undergrad/extended/#:~:text=The%20Concurrent%20Baccalaureate%2FMaster's%20Degree,degree%20and%20a%20Master's%20degree)) program for an ScM in Computer Science in their 4 years of undergrad? I'm coming in with a 5 in Calc BC and enough background for csci 190, but I do want to also take economics and psych electives, and I don't know how hard the workload will be. Can someone give me some pointers?  \n\n\nP.S. if (in the very unlikely case) this comes out to be doable and not extremely hard, could I tack on an applied math-econ ScB on the side? From my calculations,   \nScB CS will take 14 courses  \nScM CS will take 8 courses but 2 of those can overlap, so a total 20 courses for CS  \nScB Applied Math-Economics will take 16 courses, and I can overlap one APMA course with my chosen CS Pathways, so 15 courses  \nIn total, 35 courses with some space for electives. Though I think I will take my electives in my first three years and not senior year due to the pressure of doing a capstone course   \n\n\nPlease let me know if I am delusional and this is impossible because that is probably the case LOL   \nthanks in advance :D",

It just takes dead time after a point + as someone else noted, you need breadth electives for the concurrent Master's. If you're wondering \"wow I wonder why it seems that none of these super smart Ivy League students come in and do this --- this is so free!\" you should consider what version of you is planning this out... all of us came in with some ambitious plan like this and realized that there was little point in it. I think most folk that come in having convinced themselves that they want to pursue this don't want to admit that they're more interested in the credential than the education. Note also that the CS people have historically been asshole pedants about requirements and do not like to substitute *anything*, so there's basically no skimping out there; my advisor told me about a previous advisee who almost didn't graduate on time because the CS department didn't want to let them use an appropriate course from junior spring as their senior capstone, as one example.\n\nUse the time you'd need for your breadth requirements and become an open source contributor instead.",

If I do pursue the ScB in Economics, then I should be able to cover the social sciences part, and the other 4 courses I should be able to cover through electives.   \n\n\nI agree, I could stay an extra year, but I don't yet know how my parents feel about covering the cost of that. Therefore, I am exploring my options at the moment. I really appreciate your advice :)",

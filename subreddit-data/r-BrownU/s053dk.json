    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019m a prefrosh and I was wondering about the differences between the normal and quiet housing. I understand that basically quiet housing means that probably less/no partying occurs in those halls, but I was wondering if any students could speak to their experience, or if different \u201ctypes\u201d of students generally choose one over the other? Like do more hardcore studying &gt; fun students tend to choose quiet housing or is it generally mixed the same as regular housing? Also, do students generally abide by the rules of special housing?",

            "comment": "I did quiet housing my freshman year and loved it! I met all my friends there. I would say that the people who choose quiet housing are pretty mixed \u2014 many are fun-loving, casual party enjoying people who just want to go to bed at a decent hour while others are super studious pre-med types. Personally I am an early sleeper and early riser, so the 11pm curfew was great. If you are an introvert who likes peace and quiet, quiet housing is a godsend. If you\u2019ll get annoyed because you can\u2019t host 12 of your friends in your dorm room and blast music past midnight, then it\u2019s probably not for you.",

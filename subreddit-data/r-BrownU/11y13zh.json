    "postText": "Hi, Im a junior in high school at the moment.  Does anyone know the benefits of attending Brown\u2019s precollege programs? Eg Summer@brown? Beyond the academic opportunity; like if it would give you a foot in the door and possibly help you with admission? Particularly the online Summer@Brown. Also if it\u2019s common to receive financial aid for the online programs.",

I made wonderful friends that I stay in touch with and we support each other through these intense years in high school. It was my first opportunity to be around people just like me who are smart and driven in the same ways to excel academically. I enjoyed living in a dorm (although if I end up at Brown I hope I get any other dorm!!!) My professor was good, not great, just good. The workload was pretty heavy but great for me heading into this school year. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how valuable an online experience would be. The biggest value of my Brown summer was the friends, social interaction, peer reviews and learning from them. I don\u2019t think it would be the same in an online environment. \n\nAs far as a leg up with college applications, it probably doesn\u2019t help but probably doesn\u2019t hurt either. The way that applications are reviewed, they will only know my participation in Brown PreCollege because it is listed as an activity. \n\nIf you can go in person and you want to do it, go for it! It was such a great experience for me.",

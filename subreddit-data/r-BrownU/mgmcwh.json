That\u2019s a gross understatement - it seems like students are really suffering at the moment, but despite repeated attempts at a conversation on mental health days the University remains steadfast in its resolve to do absolutely nothing to help. In the wake of the tragic death of a Yale first year student, it has become all the more imperative that we act now. Please, consider signing and sharing this petition I drafted. Mental health is health too, and the university should care for the health of its students.\n\nhttp://chng.it/f2467snRhp",

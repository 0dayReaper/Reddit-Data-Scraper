    "postText": "Is this a combination of both majors, so we can get a degree for both without exactly \"double majoring\"? I'm deciding whether to choose between this or just computer science--what's the benefit of each? Also, on the Brown bulletin website, the computer science requirements page lists a few pathways. Are the same pathways offered for the applied mathematics-computer science major? (I'm thinking data science)",

            "comment": "It is a double major, but it is optimized by design to require fewer courses. If you are mathematically inclined (which is seems you are since you are looking at the Data Science pathway), APMA offers top tier coursework that would be very helpful for the more mathy areas of CS (AI/ML/Data Science/Theory/Algorithms). In particular, there are some excellent Prob/Stats classes (1650/1660/1690/1740), a good sequence in Operations Research (1200/1210), several classes in PDEs/Dynamical Systems. One difference between CS and APMA-CS is that CS requires 2 CS pathways and APMA-CS requires only 1. Given the open curriculum, there is nothing stopping you from doing 2 CS pathways as an APMA-CS major. The only potential downside of APMA-CS is that you need to do the intro DiffyQ sequence, and do either computational linear algebra (useful for AI/ML/Data Science) or Computational Diffy Qs. The APMA background should give students a leg up for a variety of jobs (quant type jobs, Data Science, AI/ML roles). For grad school, the APMA background would be a big benefit.",

Things are weird, but the brown cs website should be the best place to look for more info (this, looking at department websites, applies for pretty much all departments you're interested in tbh)",

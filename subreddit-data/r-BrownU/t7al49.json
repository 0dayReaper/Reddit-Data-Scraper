Five negative rapid flows during the peak of the symptoms and a negative state PCR test so not Covid, apparently.   No one has had any flu exposure for the last couple years so its coming roaring back...\n\nIf you can go get a PCR test at the Convention Center to make sure that its not a false negative on your rapid test.\n\nAnd everyone, get a flu shot if you haven't already!",

Idk if brown study spaces have opened back up but you can certainly find a quiet public spaces outside with decent lighting within range of Brown wifi (you can get on guest if you're not a brown student). \n\nThe IHOP on the west side of the mall is a bit of a walk but is open 24 hours and is usually petty quiet. The staff there is pretty chill im sure they wouldn't harass you if you got a meal and coffee and stayed quiet a while. Don't know if they have wifi.\n\nSakis downtown is also open pretty late and probably has wifi. Not really super quiet since it's a pizza place, but they're also pretty chill and probably wouldn't harass you if you buy a slice and hang out for a while on your laptop.",

    "postText": "Hello! I'm a non-US high school junior interested in the biophysics undergraduate concentration at Brown University.\n\nWhat really draws me to Brown is its Open Curriculum, as well as its reported close collaborative atmosphere. I've also read that it's the Ivy with the happiest students! I really wanted to avoid the Ivies, but all the things I read about Brown absolutely compels me to try applying to the uni this coming senior year :DD\n\nMay I ask for feedback from anyone who studied undergrad biophysics there? I don't see a lot of posts about it and I could only get enough information from the website. I'd really appreciate it if I would be able to hear student insights about the concentration! \n\nThank you so much!",

            "comment": "I study biochem, but biophysics just seems to be to biochem concentration with more physics requirements. Only one student graduated with a biophysics concentration in 2021. \n\nAnyway the concentration has a lot of requirements compared to other, 19. This means you\u2019ll still get to enjoy the OC but maybe not as much as some of your friends. \n\nSpeaking for biochem it\u2019s stressful but certainly doable. Plus you get flexibility to focus on areas that interest you (I\u2019ve taken a lot of chem classes as a biochem concentrator). There\u2019s also good overlap between biochem/biophysics and med school requirements/recommended classes, if that\u2019s your sorta thing",

So, that flexibility you mentioned is certainly appealing!\n\nIt's a relief to hear that there's a lot of overlap between biochem/biophys and medschool reqs/recc classes. I'm aiming to do my degree with a premed tracking in mind, so thank you for that!",

If you are already set on taking Chem, bio, physics, and math then it can make a lot of sense. You still get a lot of the benefits that the open curriculum provides but the amount of requirements reduces that quite a bit",

I guess that's not too much of a problem/deal-breaker for me.\n\nMay I ask about the classes that you're taking or you've taken? How about the academic/social/collab environment of biophysics? I'd really love to know! Thank you so much :DD",

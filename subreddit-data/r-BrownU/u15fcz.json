    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nI was very fortunate to be admitted to both Brown and Duke as an international student with plans to major in Computer Engineering/Computer Science/Applied Math.\n\nI am currently leaning towards Brown while considering the following factors and wanted your help to understand whether I am weighing them too much/little:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Location**: as an international student from Asia, I will be living very far from home so my parents want me to be decently close to family friends, and given Brown\u2019s proximity to both NYC and Boston vs Duke\u2019s relatively secluded location in North Carolina, I\u2019m leaning more towards Brown\n* **Academics (related to major)**: from what I have found online, I think Brown may have an edge over Duke with respect to areas like AI and machine learning which are of interest to me, while Duke may have an edge in the engineering side of things, so I believe that both universities will certainly be able to help me explore my passions to the best of my capability\n* **Academics (outside major)**: I have a decent amount of interest in the humanities (Econ) and languages which I want to explore at university, and Brown\u2019s Open Curriculum makes me lean more favorably towards Brown in this regard\n* **Employer reputation**: I feel like both are such amazing universities hence pretty equal in this regard (and one likely wouldn\u2019t have an edge over the other?)\n* **Culture**: Brown seems to be a very relaxed and low-stress school, which is also true for Duke from what I have heard, but Duke seems to be much more sports-oriented (and I don\u2019t necessarily find myself to be so sports-oriented?) so I\u2019m kinda leaning towards Brown but not sure if this concern is valid enough\n\nThank you in advance for your help, and please let me know if I have missed out on any highly obvious or subtle factors from consideration :)",

            "comment": "The Brown applied math department is one the university\u2019s strongest departments, if not THE strongest. USNews has Brown applied math as #3 in the US, tied with MIT, and above HYPS and Caltech. If you are thinking in majoring in applied math, Brown 100%.\nAs for student life, Brown is probably also better, given that you\u2019re not sports oriented. Sports culture is HUGE at Duke, and if you\u2019re going to be living somewhere for 4 years, that sort of stuff does matter. Either way you can\u2019t really go wrong, so good luck wherever you go!",

In Providence there are buses, trains to Boston and NYC, and it's very easy to walk around the city. In my opinion the location and student life at Brown would be much better.",

            "comment": "Sounds like Brown is perfect for you, in my opinion! I agree with pretty much everything you said. However, as an engineer here I'll say that if you feel very strongly about computer engineering in particular, you should go to Duke. The engineering program here is definitely good, but I get the feeling that it's a lot better at many other schools. Furthermore, you have so many requirements as an engineer that you may not get to properly explore your other academic interests (though I suppose still moreso than at another school?). However, our applied math and CS departments are both some of the best in the world; if I got a do-over I would have studied APMA-CS here.",

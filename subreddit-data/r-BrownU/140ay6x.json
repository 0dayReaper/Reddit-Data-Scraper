            "comment": "Ayt so this is essentially a rly long post abt quiet housing that I want some advice on (original post got taken down even\ud83e\udd72):\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHi! So I\u2019m an incoming freshman, and I have to fill out the housing form soon. Atm, I\u2019m deciding between quiet housing, substance-free, and regular housing. I\u2019m leaning toward quiet housing, but I have some reservations. I\u2019m an extremely light sleeper with an irregular sleep schedule, so I want to be able to sleep at whichever time for as long as possible without being constantly woken up. Minor sounds often wake me up and distract me from studying.\n\nQuestions:\n1. How quiet do people actually stay? Basically, can u hear other ppl or distracting noises from ur dorm? Is it like you\u2019re only allowed to whisper or talk to ppl rly quietly?\n2. Social aspect: I\u2019m guessing that the ppl who choose quiet housing are introverted and non-partier ppl, which isn\u2019t exactly a good thing. I\u2019m a semi-introvert (like more extroverted than most introverts if that makes sense lol) but I rly wanna branch out in college and go to parties and social events when I\u2019m in the mood. Will living in quiet housing make that more difficult? I wanna have more extroverted friends than I did in high school since I felt like they were a lot shyer than me. Is it difficult to get invited to dorm parties if u live on a quiet floor?\n3. Cleanliness: I figured that sub-free housing would be cleaner than regular housing bc of the lack of vomit, but how would quiet housing compare? How often is there drug use in quiet housing?\n\nI was wondering if anyone could comment or make any suggestions on any of this based on experience? :)) What would be the best option? Also, is it known which dorm buildings the quiet/sub-free floors will be housed in, or is that decided upon later on? Thnx sm!",

Depends on the dorm and floor, but some of the dorms have pretty thin walls; you definitely can hear the lounge when people are talking normally if your room is close to it or if the room next to you is moving around stuff. For the most part, though, peeps respect established quiet hours. I rarely had a problem with noise levels despite living next to a lounge!\n\n2. I have friends who've lived in quiet housing, and it hasn't been difficult for them to have fun outside of the dorms; it's just up to what they're into and who they know. You'll make friends in your dorm, but you'll make friends outside, too-- whether that's during orientation or throughout the school year. So, if you want to go to a party, you'll be able to find one :)\n\n3. Not too sure about that, but anything's a possibility tbh! Cleanliness depends on who lives on and visits your floor. I've found that dorms with semi-private bathrooms tend to be cleaner, though, since you know who generally uses it.",

Also want to note that if you\u2019re trying to meet a prerequisite for a course you\u2019re interested in for the Fall that requires linear algebra, you can still take that course and request an override! You can override most classes as long as you feel capable enough and/or have met the general background knowledge!",

However, you can try to request an override to see if the prof lets you in-- saying that you are planning to take the prereq course concurrently. It will then count towards your degree. For some courses, you can take the required ones simultaneously.",

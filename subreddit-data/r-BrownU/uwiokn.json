            "comment": "Honestly this is a tough question. Are you an undergraduate? I\u2019m not familiar with international student policy. Do you have permission to live off campus from the university? I transferred in and basically had to scour the internet looking for a place to rent. Ended up getting a place 15 min from campus (I have a personal vehicle). I don\u2019t recommended this to new students. Parking is annoying and I definitely feel separated from the \u201cschool\u201d environment. If you do rent try your best to be within walking distance of the campus. Sadly there aren\u2019t many landlords willing to rent to the younger population as they don\u2019t want their properties to get messed up. I personally had a few refuse to rent to me because I was a college student even though I am older then the average student. Like I said I don\u2019t know your background but I highly recommended trying to acquire on campus housing if it\u2019s possible. If that\u2019s not possible look into Fox Point or Wayland areas.  I know a few who rent there. You should try and reach out on the University discord or other platforms (I wish I could give you links but I\u2019m not familiar with them)  to meet potential roommates as a lot of places are expensive or not single rooms but instead places with multiple rooms meant for a few people. I know there are people on here more suited to answer this question then me come on people help out!!!!!!",

Your best bet is to get into contact with other incoming students and try and setup some roommate situation. Does anyone have any good info on platforms to meet other incoming students?",

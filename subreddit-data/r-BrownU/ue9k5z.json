    "postText": "Hello! I know responses will be biased since I'm posting here, but I'd love some last-minute college decision advice!\n\nI plan on majoring in political science or public policy and hopefully completing health care policy research as an undergraduate student. I currently plan on entering law school after undergrad.\n\nLeaning towards Duke (\\~15k/yr):\n\nPros:\n\n* There is a dedicated school of public policy\n* Strong social scene / sports culture\n* Loved the campus when I visited\n* Top-notch alumni network\n* Southern\n\nCons:\n\n* Most expensive option\n* Not an Ivy - idk if that's a huge deal?\n\nBrown (\\~13k/yr):\n\nPros:\n\n* Very collaborative culture\n* The open curriculum is appealing - can explore interests\n* Excellent law school placement\n\nCons:\n\n* It has the weakest name of the 3?\n* Strong drug presence worries me\n\nUPenn CAS (\\~12k/yr):\n\nPros:\n\n* Houses a strong law school and has great law school placement\n* Cheapest of the 3 by a little bit\n* Selected for Benjamin Franklin Scholars program - interesting interdisciplinary seminars\n* Strongest name\n\nCons:\n\n* When I visited the campus and talked to current students, I couldn't shake the feeling that everyone wanted to be at Wharton.\n* Internal divisions within the student body (Wharton vs. everyone else) seemed much more prevalent than at other schools.\n\nOther schools I was previously considering: Georgetown SFS (\\~25k/yr), JHU (\\~7k/yr), Rice (\\~9k/yr), Williams (\\~5k/yr)\n\nAny advice would be appreciated!",

Drug presence etc is pretty exaggerated and let\u2019s be honest - it\u2019s there everywhere. \n\nWith the open curriculum, you can for sure explore poli sci/ IAPA (basically ir)/ public policy which are all offered as separate majors. Duke might be better for other streams but in your case, Brown hands down.\n\nMight be a bit biased being brown\u2019 26 but being honest imo.",

Do you have any sources that say Duke and Penn\u2019s law school placements aren\u2019t as strong? I\u2019ve looked online for law school placements by school, but have only ever found Brown\u2019s. 50+% make it to T14s, and 20+% make it HYS, which is pretty remarkable, but I\u2019m yet to find similar statistics for other colleges.

Similar to Duke but better funding and buildings. There IS a very large drug presence on campus but you can counter that by requesting substance-free housing and not partaking.\n\nPenn is world class when Wharton is included. Else, you have better choices.",

Every college has an ample amount of substances, and it\u2019s not like Brown is an exception or has a rampant drug problem. Additionally, your proximity to substances really depends on the people you associate with. Your decision to engage with substances or not will not hinder your social, academic, or professional life at Brown.",

How about [Public Health rankings in the 30s](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-health-schools/public-health-rankings)? Perelman doesn't do healthcare policy, their Public Health department does. \n\nHow about [Penn's online-only CS masters](https://platform.onlinelearning.upenn.edu/offering/master-of-computer-and-information-technology-a0Q2E00000Jnj9CUAR) that cannot take in-person classes nor participate in on-campus recruiting?\n\nNote: Penn *does* have some great schools, but for OPs situation it seems suboptimal to attend Penn.",

CS masters program that's known to be stronger than that of other schools like Columbia\n\nThere's a clear difference between an online masters and a more typical in-person masters program\n\nIt's not about a specific public health department at Penn I'm referring to when I talk about Perelman, it's the fact that Penn has a world-class hospital system right next to campus as well as a bunch of stipended medical research positions for undergrads of any year\n\nThere's also public health figures both within Penn Medicine as well as Wharton that you can have access to as a Penn student\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was responding specifically to the statement that non-Wharton Penn somehow isn't world-class, but even besides that Penn is a great place to be for what OP is interested in, especially if they want options and decide that law school might not be for them in the future",

However, u/Fall_2022 is right in that it's heavily exaggerated.\n\nSure, I'd say there are more people who experiment with acid and other psychedelics than other schools, but drug use is far from integral to the social scene in the way football is to a Big 10 school. The drug scene is easily avoidable, so you would not in any way feel pressured to participate.",

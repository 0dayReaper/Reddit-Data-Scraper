Did you feel like you became a better academic writer because of this course? Do you recommend it?\n4. How bad is the workload? Will it overwhelm me too much to take it first semester of freshman year?\n\nThanks in advance! :)",

Before I took it, writing anything was a terror inducing experience. It seemed so overwhelming to write a piece that a professor at BROWN is going to read and grade. In this class you aren't taught how to write an academic paper, but rather you are taught how to develop your own methodology for writing academic papers. I loved it with Jackson especially because he added an extra degree to the class by focusing our readings and papers on topics related to social justice because it prepared me to participate in conversations about race, power, and privilege",

            "comment": "I took this course last semester, which was also the first semester of my freshman year! The course entirely depends on who is teaching it. My professor was a graduate student, and the workload was extremely light, with only three essays throughout the semester ranging from 2 to 6 pages. However, I\u2019ve heard friends had wildly different workloads, especially with different amounts of readings between classes and logs to make sure everyone actually completed the reading. I would definitely recommend the class, but you should attend a few different sections taught by different professors to decide which one works best for you.",

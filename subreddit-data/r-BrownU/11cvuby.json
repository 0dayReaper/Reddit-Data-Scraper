    "postText": "Hello, my name is Kathleen and I am currently a high school junior in Florida. I am researching a few colleges and was wondering if a Brown alum could answer the following questions:\n\n1. How did the open curriculum at Brown\u00a0benefit your education?\n2. What is something unique about Brown that makes you proud to be part of its community and sets its apart from other colleges?\n3. How does Brown actively uphold its values of inclusivity, collaboration, and empathy on campus?\n4. Which tradition at Brown do you think best embodies its community and environment?\n5. How has your experience at Brown contributed to you life now (professionally, socially, academically, etc.)?\n\nThank you so much for your time; I appreciate it!! :)",

            "comment": "Kathleen - Disclaimer: I am not a \"recent\" grad....  \n\n\nHow did the open curriculum at Brown benefit your education?\n\n   \\- Meant I didn't have to take any math or science classes :-D  \n   \\- Enabled me to experiment and explore with topics, courses and departments I would never have interacted with otherwise.   \nWhat is something unique about Brown that makes you proud to be part of its community and sets its apart from other colleges?\n\n\\- The curriculum - and the attitude/understanding of learning and education that it fosters. Not true for everyone at Brown, and less true today than many years ago (before students became obsessed with \"getting a good job). \n\nHow does Brown actively uphold its values of inclusivity, collaboration, and empathy on campus?\n\n   \\- I leave this for more recent grads to respond to.  \nWhich tradition at Brown do you think best embodies its community and environment?\n\n   \\- I don't know. I think that the policy (not a tradition, per se) of the S/NC grading option supports the attitude toward learning that I mentioned above. Years ago, almost NO undergrad discussed grades or averages or test scores in a way that was more than about that specific moment in time. Now it seems students are more concerned about their transcripts and grades. Much more. \n\n  \nHow has your experience at Brown contributed to you life now (professionally, socially, academically, etc.)?\n\n   \\- I have a career working mostly in higher education, and worked at Brown for a while. So it was part of what made me think about a career in education. Also, I studied international relations, and have worked/lived overseas, and Brown helped me feel comfortable/understand about living/interacting with other cultures etc. \n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "Allow me to add - the most important part of undergraduate education is the community of students you interact with.  While it changes over time, Brown has consistently had high quality students who tend to be be collegial and NOT hard core competitive.   You will also find world class professors who actually care about undergraduate education and get to know the students.  I\u2019m a fossil (class of \u201869) but return to campus regularly.   We instigated the \u201cNew\u201d curriculum, which codified the existing ideas that Brown was a place to explore as well as excel - high standards, but with a much reduced concern over things like grades.  You will love it.",

And is there any way to dispute that?\n\nIn particular, I am a physics major switching to engineering, and I am hoping to get credit for introductory engineering courses that correspond to the physics I took (which was required for engineers at my school)",

            "comment": "u/AssociateClean pretty much hit the nail on the head, but I'll give you a little more insight as an engineering transfer. Sometimes the transfer credit evaluator gives you unassigned engineering credits for physics courses you took at your previous university. If this occurs, you would have to request it be switched to a PHYS credit in order to proceed with an ABET accredited engineering degree (e.g. ME, ChemE, EE, etc.) as ABET rules do not allow physics courses to be deemed equivalent to EN 4 for some reason.\n\nIn terms of prerequisite knowledge, here are the equivalents you might be looking at as someone coming in with physics credits (note your school may have different names for these):\n\n\"Intro to Engineering\" + \"Intro to Mathematical Modeling\" -&gt; EN 3\n\n\"Physics 1: Mechanics\" -&gt; EN 4\n\n\"Physics 2: Electricity and Magnetism\" + \"Electromagnetics\" -&gt; EN 51\n\n\"Physics 2: E&amp;M\" + \"Circuits and Systems 1\" + \"Circuits and Systems 2\" -&gt; EN 52\n\nHowever, as I said earlier, you cannot simply cash in a physics course you took as EN 4 unless you're simply looking to get an AB. For a ScB, you would have to submit an unassigned physics credit to the physics department for PHYS 50 equivalency review.\n\nAlso, the engineering department handles equivalency requests a little differently. Unlike for other courses where you'd simply submit your evaluation requests through ASK, requests for engineering credit must go through the department portal (there's a Google form for it somewhere if you dig around the engineering website long enough). For specific engineering equivalency questions, you would need reach out to Professor Suuberg, but I hope you find this helpful!",

Engineering teaches its intro physics courses in house to allow for more project oriented work than lab oriented. For example, physics 1 is taught as \u201cEN4\u201d and the subject matter for a traditional physics 2 class is split into EN51 and EN52, with each of the latter courses going into a lot more depth. Phys50 is just the route you\u2019d take as a transfer since most schools teach mechanics in the physics department",

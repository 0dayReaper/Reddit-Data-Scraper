There was a wide freestanding dresser with a few drawers similar or equal to the desk height. I think I was in 307? I was able to use the Blue State WiFi from living above the coffee shop.\nLaundry required going outside and down the steps and the stairwells go the opposite direction that you'd anticipate from the entrances due to the anti-riot design. Laundry and study lounge are on the ground floor. Dorms second floor and above. Stairs from the ground floor to second floor are not indoors and weren't shoveled over the weekends and were essentially ice slides. Very few people shared bathrooms that were single rooms with a toilet, sink, and real bathtub shower - an additional sink was available outside the bathrooms for brushing teeth, etc in morning rushes for class. Doubles came in different sizes.",

Priorities.\n\nIt\u2019s a really nice, small dorm. I think you should consider yourself lucky. NP3 was always my favorite freshman dorm.",

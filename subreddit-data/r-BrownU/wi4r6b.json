If you\u2019ve done ap stats and multi then most likely you\u2019ll be familiar with all/most of the concepts of 1650, but the assignments are still fairly hard. Also really varies semester to semester and based on who\u2019s teaching it",

Meanwhile, AP stats was considered the easier option for students deciding between that and AP calc when I was in high school. AP stats also doesn\u2019t require any calculus, whereas APMA 1650 assumes you know how to take partials",

I had a fantastic professor (Makrides) when I took the course, and all of the multivariable calculus that was needed was explained pretty clearly.",

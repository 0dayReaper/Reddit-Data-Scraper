Maybe if you had actually sex you wouldn\u2019t be so uptight?\n\nAlso this person saved up and worked for $10,000 on top of keeping a clear head in this terrible situation. It is disgusting that you would completely disregard this just because she had sex in a committed relationship. Sex does not mean worthless whore. Once you have sex you dont suddenly become a prostitute. \n\nWe arent trying to support a random sob story. We are trying to support someone who we feel deserves better. None of this is her fault. Abuse is NEVER the fault of the victim. \n\nI wholeheartedly wish you and anyone else like you would fuck off, there is no point at all in aggregating situations like this.",

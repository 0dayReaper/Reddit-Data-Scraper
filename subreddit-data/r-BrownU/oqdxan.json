            "comment": "Save any minuscule differences, the 4 towers are identical. They are (I believe) 4 person suites, each composed of 4 single rooms and a shared bathroom. The rooms themselves are extremely un-noteworthy; they are on the smaller side, but not uncomfortably so. I never had any issues with bugs or other pests in Tower B, and the only real difference between rooms is the view. \n\nThere aren\u2019t any elevators, but the \u201cground floor\u201d is actually level 3 or 4 (can\u2019t quite remember), so don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not on the first or second floors\u2014 the walk up isn\u2019t as bad as you were probably expecting. \n\nThere is 1 communal kitchen per tower, which isn\u2019t really ideal\u2014 Emwool, my freshman dorm, had 1 kitchen per floor, for example. I didn\u2019t use the kitchen in Grad Center but I imagine it is overcrowded and under-maintained. \n\nFor some reason I\u2019m blanking on the bathroom situation. I want to say it was a semi-private (aka private to your suite) bathroom with a stall, a shower, and two sinks. Nothing extraordinary, but it would be cleaned and supplied by facilities which is nice (apartment-style buildings don\u2019t have that luxury). \n\nI\u2019m guessing you are already familiar with campus, but just for completeness, it\u2019s right outside of Wriston Quad (where the Ratty is) and about a 3 minute walk from the main green. \n\nOverall, it is a very unexciting place to live, which is both good and bad: it\u2019s not very spacious or luxurious, but its also not dilapidated or pest-ridden. Very middle-of-the-road. \n\nHope that helps, let me know if there\u2019s anything else you want to know, and anybody else please correct me if I got something wrong.",

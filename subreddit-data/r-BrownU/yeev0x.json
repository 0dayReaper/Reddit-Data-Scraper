    "postText": "People are already resigning apartments for next academic year (my floor is the only floor in my apt that hasn't been resigned). This just feels so early compared to my home town. Is this normal? I'm getting pressure from my current landlord to sign asap but I don't want to (figuring out roommates, want to look for potentially other places). But with the way things seem, just nervous that there won't be any decent apartments by spring. Any advice?",

            "comment": "I\u2019m going into my last semester at Brown and this is like the last thing on my bucket list: Loui\u2019s challenge. Stay up all night, go to Loui\u2019s when it opens in the morning at 5am (or whenever it does, and I think it only opens on the weekends right now because of the pandemic).\n\nAnother thing pre-pandemic that I did that was kinda fun was the Ratty Challenge. During reading period I grabbed a few friends and we spent the whole day studying in the Ratty 7:30am-7:30pm. Surreal experience. Obviously probably won\u2019t happen this semester but given your class year and the trajectory of the pandemic I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have the opportunity to do this.\n\nLastly, this may just be because I\u2019m from a city and not used to quiet streets, but running around campus with friends at night is also a great time.\n\nI may be able to think of other things, but these three definitely came to mind quickly. There are all sorts of \u201cchallenges\u201d deep within Brown student lore, so I\u2019m also sure if you ask around people will have other cool things they\u2019ve done.",

Check the South stair case which you have to access either through the basement or the 2nd floor.\n\nSci Li roof but that's advanced and dangerous.\n\nThe Risden quad tunnels.  There are tunnels systems connecting the buildings.  They aren't easy to get into.\n\nVisit the trifecta of odd museums.  John Hate, the South America history one and the Annmary Brown memorial.  Supposedly if you visit all 3 something special happens.\n\nVisit the Providence Athenaeum, one of the oldest libraries in the US.\n\nGo to RISD and visit their buildings.\n\nSwan Point Cemetery and find HP Lovecraft's grave.\n\nFind the famous buildings from HP Lovecraft's stories and wherever he had lived /stayed.\n\nVisit the RISD museum.\n\nFind and visit some of the obscure departments.  The education Dept is hidden in plain sight.  Slavic studies had an interesting building last time I checked.\n\nFind the odd libraries.  Outside of the museum libraries already mentioned there are several obscure ones like the music library or the Slavic library.\n\nGo to a bar in downtown Providence (when allowed after COVID).  Visit JWU or PC campuses.  Explore the jewelry district.\n\nThere used to be a small art theater near RISD (south water st?) which would show art films and had couches instead of seats.  Not sure if it's still there.\n\nWild Colonial Tavern has lots of history and it's a local favorite.  Visit some if the punk bars in the RISD area (not sure if they're still there but I think it's XS lounge now).\n\nVisit Newport if you haven't already yet.  There used to be a ferry that you could take from Providence which could make an awesome summer or spring day trip.\n\nGet off the hill and explore Providence.  If Haven brothers is still open go get some night time junk food.\n\nDrink some coffee milk.\n\nEnjoy.",

As u/jchiang mentioned there are many challenges that brown has that you can try to ask around. Here\u2019s just some that I\u2019ve found others partaking in.\n\nSci-li challenge,\nMain green on 4/20,\n5AM Loui\u2019s,\nNaked donut run,\nPrimal scream before finals,\nSnowball fights on main green \n\nAlso Facebook has a lot of events that brown students are currently doing. A lot of them are really fun!\n\nAlso be on the lookout for various events the dining halls are doing. The fried chicken at the ratty during Marti Gras is to die for.",

However, if you face the bridge and turn 180\u00b0 and follow the railroad tracks away from the bridge and back in the direction of campus, you\u2019ll eventually come to an old, sealed tunnel that runs under College Hill. I was able to get inside and explored this with some buddies as a sophomore and Junior and it was awesome. They may have bolted it up. Wear long pants and ideally waterproof boots, you might get knee deep in muck at parts. Bring good sources of light too. It\u2019s pitch dark down there and without that you\u2019ll miss all the scenery.  You can even see what a friend told me is the foundation of the SciLi from below at a point. \n\nI\u2019m sharing this well kept Brown secret with Reddit and I trust y\u2019all not to ruin it for others. \n\nEdit:  [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Side_Railroad_Tunnel) is the tunnel.",

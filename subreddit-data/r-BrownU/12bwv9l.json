    "postText": "When I visited Brown it felt like glorified high school. I didn\u2019t see anyone my age or older. I\u2019ll be an older freshmen, starting at 21 years old. Are there a mix of ages in the classes? Do undergrad mix with graduate students? I felt so out of place on campus\n\nEdit: I really appreciate the comments assuring me there will be good mix of older students. Just from my initial tour I didn\u2019t meet or see any. It\u2019s hard to relate and make friends with people who can\u2019t relate to you maturity and experience wise. I\u2019m sure I can find my people now. Thank you everyone!",

            "comment": "I personally didn\u2019t feel too old compared to most students when I started at Brown at 23. As a freshman, I was trying to figure out the whole college thing too, so I was kind of in the same boat as a lot of them. With the exception of a few things, I didn\u2019t really feel much older than them either. If you do want to interact with older students, there are plenty of students admitted through a program called RUE who are usually 24+. Even so, I was surprised by the number of 21 and 22 year olds in the dorm with me who weren\u2019t even RUE. They took gap years and stuff due to COVID or were in the Korean military or something, so it wasn\u2019t hard to find people \u201cmy age.\u201d Fwiw, most of my friends when I started at Brown fell into the 20-22 age range, but I now have social circles ranging from 19-40. I wouldn\u2019t worry about feeling old.\n\nTo answer your question directly, classes are \u201cmixed\u201d in the sense that anyone from any graduating class can take almost every class at Brown (exceptions include the handful of ones with term restrictions like freshmen/senior seminars).",

They were excited by the new found freedom and partying and going to frat parties and I\u2019m past that.\n\nGeneralizing a group of 1500 people based on a single one is silly.\n\nYour disdain and feelings of superiority over people just 2-3 years younger than you suggests that your roommate being less mature than you is not the problem you need to be worrying about.",

The new Veteran's program works similarly. We're bringing in 10 RUES and 20+ Veterans this Fall, so you will be far from the only \"older\" first-year.\n\nRegarding housing: Historically, very few non-traditionals (RUE/Vet) students choose to live on campus, and those that do are not guaranteed singles. So considering that you aren't even as old as these students, I'd be very surprised if you're able to get an accommodation for a single based on your age alone. It would make sense if they put you in a building with sophomores/juniors though (like the Transfer building, Wayland).",

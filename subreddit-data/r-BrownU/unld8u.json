    "postText": "I'm an incoming '26 and I LOVE  languages. I intend to learn two new ones by the time I graduate, and I'd like  to start my freshman year by diving into one, but I can't decide between Japanese, Italian, Korean and Mandarin - they're all so appealing. Obviously the actual language I choose depends on a variety of things, but I was wondering if anyone could share some info on which language teachers/classes at brown are the most loved or hated by students, or any other info that could help me decide. Thanks!! :)",

The Italian program really focuses on developing strong speaking and writing skills (which is helpful if you're planning on a study-abroad). The small class sizes help make speaking practice less awkward, and everyone I've met has been passionate about learning the language. Prof. Abbona-Sneider teaches most of the ITAL 0100-0600 sequence, and she's one of the best profs I've had at Brown so far.",

Though there is generally a pretty hefty workload, the professors are really nice and are genuinely interested in you learning the language and more about Japanese culture. The Japanese department really is just a great community and we have fun community events all the time. Highly recommend the Japanese courses at Brown!",

    "postText": "Hello! Hope you guys are having a great summer. I am just asking a quick question about applying and I apologize if it is against the rules. Can you guys explain what Brown looks for in applications. Normally, I would ask in the applying to college subreddit, but I think the stats on that subreddit are a bit blown out of proportions. Thank you!",

Namedropping specific classes, professors, and students programs looks very good. It makes it seem like you\u2019re genuinely interested in the school and not just applying because it\u2019s an elite institution",

                    "comment": "The second is to write a good open essay for your common app. Too many people write stereotypical essays that are just like everyone else\u2019s. There\u2019s a joke in admissions about how every other essay is about how you went on a service trip to Africa or something along those lines. Write something creative and you\u2019ll get the eye of an admissions officer who has to slog through the same old shit all day. Personally, I wrote a creative non-fiction essay about a chess match I had, and people loved it!",

            "comment": "Also, to somewhat second the other comment, name dropping is sick and shows interest, but if it\u2019s at all possible, try to schedule an official tour/visit to Brown. It\u2019ll allow you to add some things into your essay that you ACTUALLY experienced. I mentioned something about one of the statues in the green and my feeling in a particular building, and because I had actually stepped foot in each location, I was able to write with more confidence, imagery, beauty, flowery, etc. \n\nAlso, some of the best essays I\u2019ve seen utilize an archetype or a token: a single thing that an essay revolves around. By exploring the nuances and random anecdotes about said token, you are able to reveal much about yourself and your character, while also displaying your writing capability. I think this also goes for the video introduction (which is not optional btw). Anyway, good luck!",

They would even ask us to interview via zoom around the world at times, which was a LOT of work to ask of a volunteer honestly. They probably see this as a way to get similar results. That said, I have not been informed that interviews are gone permanently. My impression was this was all COVID-based unless they came to the conclusion that these videos have proven to be effective",

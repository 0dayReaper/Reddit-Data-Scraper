I was wondering if anyone would be open to speak on their experience being in the Chemistry concentration. Are there many projects teams that one can work on? Is it a supportive learning environment? What are the sizes of the higher level specialised class like? (For more context, i would be transferring)\n\nThanks",

The amount of stuff you truly have to memorize is also a lot less than the amount of stuff you have to memorize in a typical biology class, and if you just do enough practice problems (which you\u2019ll have plenty of), the memorization comes very naturally",

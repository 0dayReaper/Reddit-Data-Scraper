Is there anyone out there who is part of the phd program doing english literature in some capacity, or do you know someone who is? I'd love to get into contact with someone who is in the program who can offer some info about what it's like.",

                    "comment": "This. I was in the Brown Political Science PhD program and would occasionally get emailed questions about the program (people said I \"looked friendly\"). IIRC, the grad school can also direct you to a grad student who can give you insight into the program (I signed up to do this for a few years after prelims). Email The Graduate School.\n\nProtip: Ask someone, somewhere in the department how many PhDs they've graduated in the last 5-7 years. It will give you some idea of how the program supports their grad students. Also, beware any advisor who hasn't graduated anyone since the Obama administration - they tend to just want someone to grade papers and run sections.\n\nGood luck.",

            "comment": "Honestly, integrating as a transfer was a bit tough. Obviously, you\u2019ll have other transfers and your professors to support you, but how well you integrate at Brown really depends on who you are and how much effort you\u2019re willing to put into it. My single variable calculus was on point, but trying to remember triple integrals, stokes theorem, and divergence theorem was a bit difficult after transferring to Brown, but at the end of the day, I have no regrets.",

            "comment": "Can't answer the questions about being a transfer, but school culture wise people tend to be pretty cool! Open Curriculum's a big deal here, and means a lot people will concentrate in one area but also have another major interest that they don't want to give up (for e.g. being pre-med + humanities, learning another language - we have 15-20+ here, taking classes at RISD etc.) I'm not really involved in the party scene on-campus, but weekly parties do exist if that is your thing. Greek life is also not super huge like some other schools which is nice, and the program house system is decently varied (technology house, cultural houses, sub-free/recovery community etc.) There's also a club for almost everything (music, acting, pre-professional etc.) -- and you can always make your own if you don't see one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn terms of classes, for the most part they tend to be more collaborative than competitive (from a pre-med perspective) which is great. Most classes outside of the intro sequences (STEM tends to have large lecture-based classes) are small, and even STEM classes get smaller at the upper-level or seminar level. Professors are also pretty open to giving overrides if you show enough interest in a course. Having the ability to S/NC any course means that people in classes, especially the smaller ones, tend to be in the class b/c they're interested in the content vs. having to take a variety to fulfill distribution requirements. Lack of +/- and curves (Econ is the only department that I can think of that explicitly caps the % of As they give out, but for the most part cutoffs tend to be lowered vs. raised) also helps with the collaborative aspect.",

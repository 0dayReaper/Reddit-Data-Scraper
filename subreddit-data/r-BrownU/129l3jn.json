    "postText": "hey all! i was recently admitted to brown alongside a few other schools, namely comparing against columbia. i was wondering what the electrical engineering/mechanical engineering concentrations are like, and if it would be worth it to go to brown over columbia for that major. additionally, i heard brown doesn\u2019t offer as many job search/internship help opportunities as other schools, and was wondering if anyone could attest to this?",

            "comment": "Do not come to Columbia Engr (SEAS). I do not know Brown's engineering programs but it cannot possibly get worse than Columbia. It is a real statistic that Columbia SEAS is generally so poorly taught and uncared for that about 1/2 the incoming freshmen switch out by their junior year, necessitating Columbia to refill their engr spots with 3-2s and transfers. So, the majority of SEAS ugrad students are actually transfers.\n\nI'm serious. Don't come to Columbia SEAS, unless you are explicitly here to just get a degree and specific NYC job opps, or otherwise know exactly what you want from the very few advantages Columbia has over Brown (NYC, certain professional schools, niche programs, etc.)\n\nCurrent Columbia SEAS'23 Applied Physics. Hehe sorry for lurking.\n\nEdit: I talk more about my experience sof Princeton vs. Columbia engineering/physics here:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/127g0nf/is_columbia_for_real/jegovfo",

Among ugrads it's mainly transfers and 3-2s.\n\nBut there's also another problem I have with Columbia. So many research grants and scholarships are only available to those named scholars, so Columbia does not really encourage you to improve yourself as a student if you don't already enter as one of those scholars. I wasn't a named scholar on entry, so I wasn't able to get fuck-all during my time here.\n\nEdit. I'm sorry if this sounds disappointing. This is 100% only for the Engineering School. The College is great. I'm a double major in history, and the history professors  are among the best I've had, ever. I've had very meaningful relations with profs, peers, and classes in the humanities departments. The engineering school is just... So different. And bad.",

            "comment": "I think engineering program at Brown is nice! All the profs are super supportive and willing to help. With the internship and help opportunities, I think students do have plenty of resources (careerlab, brown alumni portal, and advisors) that are available. It\u2019s just the student must take initiative to seek and utilize them. I wouldn\u2019t say engn at brown is the best program, but I like how you can explore other things with the open curriculum. At other schools, with the many engn course requirements and gen eds, it can be hard to take what u want to take outside of engineering. Also u might change your mind, as many people do, so brown is kinda made for that. Hope this helps!",

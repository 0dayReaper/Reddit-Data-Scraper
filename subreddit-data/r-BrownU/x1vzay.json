    "postText": "Does anyone know what the process is for drop off and move in at the Andrews Dorms? We have a drop off time in the early afternoon. Not sure how it works with parking the car, getting stuff out, reparking the car, etc... Bowen street looks like it has no parking available\n\nAlso is there a Pembroke East and a Pembroke West?",

Trust me, you shouldn\u2019t have any trouble, though they do usually only give you a 15 minute time slot to park. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m not aware of their being a Pembroke East and West? Andrews is usually separated into East and West, which used to make it confusing. Make sure you\u2019ve looked up a floor plan and you know where your room is: if I remember correctly, all the odd numbered rooms are on one side and all the even numbered rooms are on the complete other side of the building",

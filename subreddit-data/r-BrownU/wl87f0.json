    "postText": " I was recently fired from my phd program for having a mental illness and an addiction. It was spun through the legal and pr machinery to make it seem that i neglected my duties, but there is no doubt from anyone outside the university who read my case that has seen that it was clear as day discrimination. I am only writing this post to say that you must always be careful who you share your information with, even when you believe you can trust them. And maybe even more importantly, do not assume that your fellow grad student will have your back as they have their own priorities regardless of how much they care for you. Just take care of yourselves. There are resources for grad students suffering with mental illness, addiction, and any other issue. It's just about finding those resources. To my international fam, stay strong.",

I live really close to Brown and have had many friends go there over the years, it can be sad how they treat some of their students.

This comes from someone who has known many addicts and has multiple family members in prison for drug related offenses. Every. Single. Addict. Blames someone or something else for their addiction because it allows them to continue down their spiral. When you don\u2019t have to hold yourself accountable, you won\u2019t hand any desire to change. The difference between an addict and an ex-addict is that one of them admitted that they were the root of the problem and took responsibility for their actions.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that you lost your position, but your current attitude echoes the vast majority of addicts. You need to take responsibility for your actions or nothing in your life will change. I can already tell by your attitude that you won\u2019t listen because you just want validation, but maybe someday you\u2019ll see my point",

Brown has a large footprint for public health research in the area of addiction and \n\neveryone I had worked with was very empathetic. Not placing blame, but it seems like you are leaving out pertinent information regarding the specifics which got you terminated. \n\nWe\u2019re you arriving to the workplace under the influence? Did you neglect duties as a result of your addiction? Did your mental health cause you to miss work and deadlines? When you say \u201cmental illness\u201d are you referring to your addiction or to something else (depression, anxiety, etc. which led to self medication with illicit substance use)? \n\nThere are several options one has of dealing with a mental illness (FMLA, ADA, etc.). However, if your performance was the real issue you were terminated and your performance was poor because of drug use then you can\u2019t fault the school\nFor that.",

No, i didn't come to the institution under the influence. by mental illness i mean my bipolar disorder. I did all the things needed and went above and beyond. The discrimination is and was real, and oied at brown agrees with me it seems, as they have taken my case forward. also to answer work questions, i had to receive accommodations, but those were all totally agreed upon by the faculty in my department as well as admin",

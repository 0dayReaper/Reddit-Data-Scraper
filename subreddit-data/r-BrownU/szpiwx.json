You can also use them to get individual food items or sides if you don't want the full \"combo\" or want something additional from places like Jo's and Ivy room, which have stuff like chips, bottled drinks, and sushi as sides.\n\nI don't usually go to 3 meals every day though, so I generally just use my leftover meal swipes for sides etc, saving points for the points only places",

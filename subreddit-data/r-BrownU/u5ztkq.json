            "comment": "In my experience, it's quite easy to find leases with a range of start dates, from June 1 through September 1. Because the market is dominated by students, the most shuffling occurs over the summer and people come and go at various times. You would also likely be able to find a sublet or sublet-turned-lease at any time over the summer, if for example you found the perfect place starting Sept 1 and needed a sublet for the month of August. The Brown grad student listserv (GSBB) is a good place to start, since people will post about sublets or leases there. You can get onto the listserv as soon as you get your Brown email address over the summer. Other than that, Zillow is probably your best bet, or directly contacting Providence realtors, but there are definitely some shady realtors and landlords out there. Providence Student Living is probably the disliked Ives St landlord the other poster is referring to, but IMO they're no worse than others, and are slowly monopolizing apartments in the Fox Point area so may be your only choice. \n\nRents have gone up quite a bit over the past few years, especially on the East Side, which (as the other poster said) is where most grad students live because it's easily walkable to campus. A two bedroom will likely cost at the minimum $1700/m and probably closer to $2,000, depending on the quality of the apartment, and they are less common, since bigger apartments tend to be divided up as rent-a-room situations. Personally I think it's still worth renting on the East Side because of the convenience, and it's a very pleasant area to live with lots of shops and restaurants. But I do know many grad students who have chosen to rent on the West Side of Providence, which is cheaper for much more space, and the neighborhood has its charms. You would almost certainly want a car if you did that. \n\nI'd suggest you start looking now. It can't hurt. Students know when they're moving out/moving to Providence way ahead of time, so in my experience people tend to find a place pretty early - like, already signing leases for September 1 now. You could definitely give your info to some realtors though I've never actually had one call me back. The market is so consistent that they don't really need to. You may have an easier time once you get on the GSBB though so it could be worth waiting for that. Also, if you know any grad students in the department you'll be joining, you could contact them and ask them to look around or post on the GSBB for you--a lot of apartments get passed between students by word of mouth.",

            "comment": "Most leases start in May. Most people lease for May and then sublet during the summer. It will be harder to find a lease off-cycle, but not impossible. Most Brown students live on the East side, near Brown or in Fox Point. You do get a free bus pass as a student if you want to live somewhere else.\n\nAlso, I don't know what your financial situation is, but rent in Providence can be relatively expensive. I rented a very cheap one bedroom in 2019 (the last year I was renting in Providence) for $950. Rent has gone up a lot since then.\n\nI wound up renting through a broker (Samson  realty), but you don't have to. On the east side, it's a lot of small landlords in houses and relatively informal. Often you can arrange with the previous tenant to sell you their furniture.\n\nI liked my landlord and can give you their name. There's one landlord on Ives Street who has a really bad reputation -- can't remember their name but someone will know. Getting on the grad student listserv can help with this kind of thing as well.",

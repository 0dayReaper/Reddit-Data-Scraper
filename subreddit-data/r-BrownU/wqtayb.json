    "postText": "Hello, I'm a rising senior hoping to submit my ED application soon!  However, I'm home-schooled.  I seem to have recalled reading a page on Brown's website for home-schooled applicants, but upon searching for it today to reference, I can't find it.  Was it taken down?  Or did I just miss it?  Did Brown's recommendations for home-schoolers change?  Thank you so much in advance!",

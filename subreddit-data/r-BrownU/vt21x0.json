            "comment": "I did Summer@Brown back in 2017 for a week so take what I say with a grain of salt given the time gap. Also I've been a student at Brown since 2019 so I have a good idea of pre and post pandemic Brown.\n\nI think most of your experience will be based upon what course/courses you're doing. I did a course called \"Learn to Program in Five Days\". The work load was not intense at all so I had a lot of time to explore Providence and did a good amount of gaming on my laptop in the night. I know there were othere people who read two entire books in the same amount of time I wrote some simple Python exercises and a crappy text adventure.\n\nAnother thing probably worth mentioning is the heat. I stayed in Grad Center D and the heat was almost unbearable so you may not want to stay inside your room all day working. Maybe get out and work at other places and interact with the other Summer@Brown students. It could be a good idea to grab a desk fan from Walmart to assist with sleeping.\n\nI think regarding food you're gonna get some meal credits to use at the Rat E (Ratty, Sharpe Refractory). I think the food there is fine, but you will have access to a bunch of places on Thayer, which is right on Brown's campus. There's a bit more on Thayer than when I was there in 2017. I recall missing breakfast from my late gaming nights and resorting to Subway to get through the day.\n\nIs there anything specific you wanna know? This is all stuff that came to mind first.",

            "comment": "Ditto on the heat!  OMG, it's unbearable.  Sadly, the dorms are in DIRE need of repair and updating, but they are very secure. The cafeteria food is really good on campus, and if you head down a few blocks off campus, you can enjoy a great variety of food options.\n\nCampus security is present around the clock everywhere on campus.  The RISD Museum has a nice collection of artwork and artifacts. The John Brown House is down the street, among many other interesting historical locations.  As far as courses, some classes, like lab sciences, for example, may require a bit more work compared to some of the intro courses.  Daily activities are available for all, and there are also off-campus weekend events as well.  There are about 5K students in the summer programs, including a good number of international students, so you definitely won't be bored.\n\nI highly recommend using the laundry service if staying for longer than a week.  The laundry rooms are gross.",

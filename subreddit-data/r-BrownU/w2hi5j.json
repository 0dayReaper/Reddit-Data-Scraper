Nobody is usually busy on weekends, so im sure you\u2019d find a few undergrads willing to share their stories",

Initially, I really disliked Brown when I just walked around (pandemic era), and now I love it. If you're coming in the summer, I might be able to give you a mini tour if you're in the area and if you haven't already come (depends on my schedule). Just DM me if you want :)",

    "postText": "I just wanted to ask about how the Bonner program is exactly like? How is like being in cohorts? What do you do in the weekly learning community sessions? \n\nThe program seems really cool and something I would 10000% be interested in, but the only thing that I am concerned about is the time commitment. I am definitely ok with spending at least 6 hours a week doing community service. It genuinely sounds like a lot of fun and something that would be super fulfilling. I am just concerned about the program taking too much of my time. I wanna do other things at Brown, like ultimate frisbee and rock climbing. Plus on top of all of that, I wanna obviously have time to study and have a social life.\n\nI guess my main question is how was it like for anyone that did the program? Were you guys able to manage your time well or was it too much of a commitment?",

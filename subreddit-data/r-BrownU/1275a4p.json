    "postText": " Current Brown senior here - congrats to all of those accepted!\n\nI'm the Co-President of Brown Esports, Brown's gaming club, with over 2,000+ members and 17 teams in our Discord channel, linked here: [discord.gg/brownesports](https://discord.gg/brownesports) (we're actually Discord partners!). You might remember us from the Minecraft campus of Brown that was in the news ([reminder](https://www.brown.edu/news/2020-04-13/minecraft)).\n\nWe're Brown's casual and competitive gaming club, so even if you play Mario Kart once a month or just want to hang out, you're more than welcome to join!\n\n**I'm posting here because our community should be able to help you quickly start meeting and connecting with other students at Brown!**\n\nBy joining our Discord you:\n\n* Join a community of 2,000+ students at Brown / RISD\n* Can start talking to upperclassmen who can immediately answer any questions you have, and other freshman / sophomores that are going to be your classmates. There are also over 200 Class of 2026 students who are finishing up their first year at Brown, who I'm sure would love to talk about it!\n* Can game with your new classmates for the next four years! There's plenty of games to be played, and they're waiting for you.\n* Don't commit to joining Brown Esports forever -- this is really important!!! Joining our Discord does not bind you to being part of our club forever. If you leave once you're here at Brown, that's fine; we've provided you a welcoming place for a little while and we're excited to have you for any time!\n* Join the Class of 2027 role, which gives you access to a special #class\\_of\\_2027\\_private channel to talk with other admits only!\n\nWe also have a [13-PC gaming lounge](https://brownesports.org/lounge), another reason to commit to Brown!\n\nWe *also* also have three events just for admitted students, including two virtual Minecraft campus tours and a game night - join our Discord or join the Bruniverse to learn more!\n\nCongratulations again, everyone!",

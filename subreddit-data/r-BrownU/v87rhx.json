    "postText": "I\u2019m applied to take a Pre-College course at Brown this summer and I\u2019m currently signed up to take a \u201cOrganic and Biochemistry course\u201d. I planned to take it as I\u2019m quite passionate about Chemistry, and I also felt that it would prepare me for my Organic Chem course material next year. However, I waitlisted myself for a \u201cBiomedical Lab Research\u201d course as well because it sounded interesting. I was totally not expecting any spots to free up because it was quite packed but today I got an email that there is an available spot for me. I don\u2019t necessarily have a need for lab experience right now but I\u2019ve also heard generally good things about Brown\u2019s lab courses so I\u2019m debating which would be more worth it to take right now. Any advice?",

Personally,  I'd choose that one over the organic/biochem class for pre-med -- based on the title as a premed you'll anyways need to take orgo and biochem at the college level (at Brown this is three classes - orgo 1/2 + a semester of biochem), and the research class seems more interesting + could give you an idea of research areas you might want to get involved with once you start college.",

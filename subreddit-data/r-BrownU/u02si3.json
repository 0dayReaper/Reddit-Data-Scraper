    "postText": "Hi, I go to the University of Michigan, a fairly up there uni, yet, there are plenty of classism issues where many who came from a poor background may feel uncomfortable because it's hard to afford things around here, and the type of things those from wealthier backgrounds talk about / their perspective due to their background just ends up being off putting. I usually don't think much of my race, and yet, I feel so, alienated because so few come from the type of background I did, and don't seem to care to really learn about it and would rather virtue signal.\n\nSo, I've been wondering for a while, do the same issues exist at Ivy League schools? Do you all deal with issues where the classes are hard but all of the resources meant to help students tend to be bogged down / unusable because there aren't enough staff to help the number of students that need those resources? I wanted to kinda survey different ivies about this. Thank you in advance for sharing your opinion.",

It\u2019s kind of obvious if you simply compare what people wear during the winter, and I notice the same thing at Brown in this regard. However, as a whole, I feel \u201cclassism\u201d is more pronounced at U of M despite Brown being a richer school.\n\nAs a smaller school, apart from what winter jackets students wear or hearing what ridiculously expensive vacations some students ventured off to, Brown does a very good job at providing free resources to those who need it. As a matter of fact, some professors and administrators would go out of their way to ensure students in need have their academic/financial/family issues addressed. It\u2019s just part of the culture here.\n\nAt U of M, I know it\u2019d be impossible to get adequate TA help in a lot of the intro courses simply due to the fact that some classes have an upwards of 1400 students registered with only so many TAs to go around. As an MSU transfer, I attest we had this same struggle.\n\nAt MSU, I remember showing up to \u201chelp room hours\u201d for physics 1 and being one of 50 students crowding around a single TA for homework help. It was mad.\n\nAt Brown, classes are luckily small enough that anyone who needs help can get it. After leaving MSU, I vowed to take advantage of as many help room opportunities as possible, and I\u2019ve never had trouble accessing a TA. Sure, some larger departments like CS still get backed up during project weeks, but it\u2019s never the cluster fuck I remember from MSU.",

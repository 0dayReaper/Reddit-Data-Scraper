    "postText": "Hi, I am an international student from Beijing, China. I am now in Grade 11, applying this year! I am going to choose Brown as my ED1 school. Currently, I am working on my 2min video portfolio for Brown. Brown is the school that I love most and I feel like I fit in, but I am still feeling a little bit worried and anxious about my application. Any advices from those who have already being accepted? Or simply if you want to pm and chat with me?",

My advice.\n- Be your most *authentic* self.\n- Hype up the Open Curriculum/your diversity in academic interests.\n- Hook the reader with something that differentiates you.\n- Make sure you come across as a solid writer. Someone who isn't writing an academic paper but also someone whose natural voice is sophisticated, if that makes sense.",

Brown was my ED school and I was incredibly attached to it, but then I got deferred and I needed to reconsider a lot of my priorities. Even though I ended up getting in RD, the deferral really shifted my mindset. Now, I don\u2019t want you to get discouraged or more anxious, but just something to consider for these schools with a 5% (or less) acceptance rate.",

Paint a picture of who you are to the best of your ability using everything you submit in your application.\n\nObviously I don\u2019t know exactly what got me into Brown but\u2026\nI think my essays were cohesive and complimented my extracurricular activities to highlight a set of characteristics that I wanted the admissions group to know about me. \n\nThese characteristics were ones that I had written down before starting my application - I attempted to connect with all of them in each part of my app (supplements, essay, activity descriptions).\n\nIn doing this I was able to define myself and then reinforce who I was showing authenticity.\n\nI believe Brown looks for people who are driven, curious, but also self-aware and independent - it is what helps you differentiate yourself and also what helps Brown categorize you.\n\nBut overall who knows lol. Just dont be boring. Brown was one of my last minute picks and I never expected to get in. Best of luck!!!",

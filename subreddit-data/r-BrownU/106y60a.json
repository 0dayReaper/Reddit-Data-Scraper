    "postText": "I\u2019m attending Brown next year, and I\u2019m very excited to explore Providence, Boston, and other surrounding areas. Is it common or abnormal for students to visit New York once or twice a year? I know I\u2019m not bringing my car, so, of course, I\u2019ll have to rely on an Amtrak or Ocella train, neither of which bothers me. But, I was looking at rides, and it appeared to be reasonable to take a day trip to New York. Thoughts?",

It\u2019s definitely not uncommon although I can say the freshman I know usually just stay a day or two during the weekend, especially a longer one, as it is a bit of a longer trip than Boston. \n\nquick tip: look into the busses as they tend to be cheaper.",

Amtraks to New York are pretty good (takes around 3/3.5 hours), as long as you book in advance because they can get quite expensive last minute. Otherwise even the buses are quite decent if you're looking for a cheaper alternative. The only issue with the bus is the possibility of getting stuck in traffic.",

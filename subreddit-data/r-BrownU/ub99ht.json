    "postText": "Have a sublet available this summer on Williams Street near Perkins/Young O . We are paying $700/month but have some wiggle room for summer rates. 3 rooms in our unit  - we have 2 units in this house so if you have more than 3 people you can get other rooms in the house as well. Newly renovated kitchen and bathroom in each unit. Fully furnished",

The problem is they installed those heavy duty window bars over the window on the outside, so if there's a fire we're fucked. We tried contacting management etc and no help. I get it's to prevent people from climbing the escape and murdering us but If there's a fire on the 1st floor or whatever we are literally gonna die. How tf can we open these damn bars??",

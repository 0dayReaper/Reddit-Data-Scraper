    "postText": "Hi, i'm mohammad! \nI was admitted to brown class of 2026 but couldn't attend due to visa obtaining issue. And thus I was deferred to class 2027. \nLast year after I sat up my brown email and account I had access to some services like linkedin learning.\nI can't get to these services (I'm not 100% sure tho) now. \nIs there anyone who i can ask about that? \n\nAnd has anyone of you been deferred one year before? \n\nThank you in advance!!",

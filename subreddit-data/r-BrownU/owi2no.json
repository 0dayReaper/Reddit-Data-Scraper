I\u2019d advise you to not worry about being \u201cpre-med\u201d or looking too much at concentration requirements, since the best part of going to Brown is that you get to experiment. Take a few CS courses to see if you really want to concentrate in CS, take a bio and chem course to see if you really enjoy pre-med, take a history course, take a first year seminar, take an art course as RISD, and explore a bit. Also I wouldn\u2019t worry about GPA since we don\u2019t even get those here at Brown. That\u2019s just my two cents since I spent my first semester worrying  too much about pre med and concentration requirements and realized it just wasn\u2019t worth the stress freshman year. Plus, you might even realize you enjoy studying something else instead!\n\nGood luck with deciding and know that no matter what you pick, you can chance courses for the first two weeks. Pm me if you need anything else.",

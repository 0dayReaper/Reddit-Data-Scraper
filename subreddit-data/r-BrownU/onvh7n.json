I was super excited about the Open Curriculum\u2014and I still am\u2014but after inputting my FYS preferences, I don't know where to continue. \n\nHoping to have an idea of which classes I want to shop for before getting on campus :)",

            "comment": "also an incoming first year so my advice prob won\u2019t be as useful compared to someone who has experience but I\u2019ll respond since no one has yet. I\u2019ve heard that we should take it easy first sem to ease into college life. Depending on your potential concentrations, you might want to consider taking 2-3 of those req/ harder courses per semester. You also should consider courses that have sequences such as chem where you have to start at a lower div at a certain semester. I suggest you start out with intro courses if you have any interest in higher divs in that subject. This will allow you to take those higher divs in the future. Of course, make sure to throw in some fun courses bc open curriculum lol. What has helped me is to list out all the possible concentrations you like and look at the courses. This can help guide you if you\u2019re lost and don\u2019t know where to begin. But remember that you aren\u2019t restricted to just those courses or have to follow a certain path. Plan based on what\u2019s best for you. I\u2019ve asked so many people for advice on schedules and i began to realize that no one is going to match what I want to do exactly so don\u2019t be afraid to be taking entirely different courses than your friends. Brown is a place for exploration so remember to take courses you have interests in :) hope this helps",

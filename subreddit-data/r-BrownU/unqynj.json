    "postText": "Hi everyone! Incoming freshman here. As the title suggests the AP French exam is tomorrow and I doubt that I'm going to do well. In the best-case scenario I might get a 3 worse case probably a 1. Can I get in any trouble for that if I report the score? If it turned out lower than a 3 can I just cancel and not report it if I already said I'll be taking it on the CommonApp? For reference I took 9 AP Exams this year and probably got a 5 on 6-7 of them. Also for some context, my French grade over 4 years of high school has been &gt;97 (our teacher gave a lot of presentations which I do well on with preparation), so I'm kind of scared they might think this as an inconsistency? Thanks in advance to everyone.\n\nEdit: Just realized Brown has on their website that they require at least 3 years and recommend 4 years of foreign language in high school. Would the 1 / no score make them think I didn't satisfy the requirement?",

I just wrote random shit on AP stat to avoid the \"-\"/ whatever \"no submission\" marker they use since it wasn't worth anything, and, of course, it was never mentioned. Come to think of it... I didn't even take 3 years of foreign language in HS (granted, I transferred to a HS in a county that didn't offer anything, so I had to go through the state's online school system GAVS, which itself only offered I and II)",

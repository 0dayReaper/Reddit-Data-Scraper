    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI\u2019m a current freshman at Brown, and I\u2019ve been considering studying CS. I took CS15 last semester and did quite well, but I am struggling big time in CS16. I\u2019m taking another class with a heavy load, too, so it\u2019s been rough. CS16 has taken quite a big toll on my mental health (I have anxiety and OCD), and I\u2019ve been hitting myself as a result because I feel incompetent.\n\nMy parents are encouraging me to drop CS16 and retake it (or rather, the new CS16/18 fusion that is replacing it) next year. I feel this would be a smarter decision for my mental health, but I\u2019m also quite a bit concerned because this means that my upperclassman years would be much more stressful. I\u2019m also worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to get an internship between my sophomore and junior years because I\u2019d be a year behind a lot of other CS concentrators. Can anyone who did the CS intro courses in their sophomore year provide any insight into their experience? Thanks.\n\nEDIT: I dropped the class. I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve finished strongly (or even halfway decently) and it caused me a lot of grief",

Fine as in got a good internship junior year then got a solid job after graduation.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve talked to the professors but i know that Kathi is known to be one of the more accommodating on things like this so you could give that a shot too. Just discussing your problem and asking for support",

I\u2019ve spoken with my professor already, but he didn\u2019t really have much to say except that CS16 is a hard class and to reach out to SAS if I felt that I had a mental condition/disorder that was negatively impacting my education.\n\nIt\u2019s reassuring to hear that you know someone that took 17/18 their sophomore year and still did well. I\u2019ll keep that in mind!\n\nHearing about",

I feel like the content delivery has felt a little bit rushed because of the shortened semester, and I can definitely relate to the feelings of incompetence. Please do not feel like you're alone in your feelings regarding the challenge that has been CS16 this past semester. Even if your grade isn't were you'd like it to be, I'm sure you've learned a ton, and undoubtedly spent many hours completing seamcarve, heap, and decision tree. If your concern is your grade, I want to remind you that most companies will not ask (nor care) about your GPA, and likely even less about your performance in one singular cs course. The fact of even passing cs16 this semester should feel like a great achievement because it has been really tough! \n\n\n\n\nI definitely recommend you meet with your TA advisor and/or with Prof. Doug himself to see what choice will be best for you. \n\n\n\n\nWishing you all the best :)",

It\u2019s true that there are 3 weeks left, but I\u2019m mentally stuck and just cannot get myself to work on projects (I have not, for reference, finished Decision Tree). I worry that I will not be able to finish decently since there is still more work to do. \n\nThank you for your concern. It really means a lot and I\u2019m definitely considering what you have to say :)",

I think another commenter noted that you could take an incomplete and then work on finishing the projects over the next year, and this might be a good thing to consider.\n\n\n\n\n You could possibly finish the incomplete over the rest of summer and the fall, and then you'd still have freedom to choose less rushed and less time intensive cs course(s) for next Spring semester. \n\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise, if you do choose to drop cs16 and do cs20 next spring, then there are still some requirements and electives that either have no prereqs, or at the most, only require cs15 (a course that comes to mind is cs22, as well as cs1800--which is a more humanities based cs class). So no need to worry about being too far behind to still pursue cs!",

Please also sign up for dean advising hours, they going to be massively helpful. Do what's best for you. This semester is not an easy one, nor a normal one.\n\nAlso a brief note on internships.. they aren't a reflection of your academic prowess. Keep staying tuned to job postings, go to the careerlab, and gather supportive friends/family to guide you through. No one does college and life from purely learning coursework well.",

If I may ask, what is an INT?\n\nI\u2019ve already spoken with a dean, but I didn\u2019t find the meeting particularly helpful as she told me to do what I was most comfortable with. Perhaps I\u2019ll meet with a different dean. \n\nThanks for the internship note. It\u2019s been something I\u2019ve been hyper focused on because I feel that internships show work experience and are therefore important to have when applying to actual jobs after graduation. Do you find this to be true?",

You\u2019re at brown, its what we do :) An INT is an incomplete, which (after a professor consents) gives you extra time to finish a course post finals. Lots of flexibility to be had \u2014 up to one year. Check the today@brown message a couple days ago.. it should be one of the priority emails and read it carefully. Everything you need to know is pretty much there but do feel free to reply/reach out if you still have Qs. \nNot gonna necessarily comment on the last followup re internship because I\u2019m still a student and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s particularly related to the coursework issue at hand.

I'm planning on doing an ScB, so it did definitely leave me with a little less space for electives (or other CS courses) than if I had started my concentration in freshman year. \n\nHowever, I found that after the intro sequence and CS30/32/33, everyone kind of branches out with the upper level courses they take, so there's less of a feeling of being \"behind.\" The first upper level I ever took had second semester seniors in it! So I'd say that while I definitely had feelings initially that I was super behind, those leveled out with time :) \n\nSomething I definitely recommend, though, is to find a concentration advisor early and plan out your schedule, roughly. It helped catch me up on requirements so that I had more free space for my junior and senior years!",

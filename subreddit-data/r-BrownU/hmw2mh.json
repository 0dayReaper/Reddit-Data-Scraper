To be honest, I was surprised that they\u2019d make me start this year since it\u2019s likely that I\u2019ll have to stay at home do online classes for most of the year.

Definitely feel for the freshmen; it's going to be a rough first two years.\n\nI'm still confused how the university is suffering terrible financial losses, though - what about the pandemic is influencing how the school makes money? CPax projected something like -$70m due to COVID-19 but they're still charging the same for everything.",

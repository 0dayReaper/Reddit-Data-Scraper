Is it easy to make friends?\n\nFor reference I'm deciding between these programs:\n\n* Brown University MSDS\n\n* Georgia Tech MS Analytics\n\n* IUB MSDS\n\n* Uc Irvine MSDS\n\n* Georgetown University MSDSA (with 7.5k scholarship)\n\n* UW Madison MSDS",

But if you are looking for a flexible curriculum, Brown might not be a good idea.\n\nGetting an internship is mostly dependent on the job market, so it\u2019s a little harder right now. But I think the title of Brown will do good generally.",

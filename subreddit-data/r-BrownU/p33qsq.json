Supposedly, freshman internships are hard to get for cs concentrators, but not impossible; I guess it's better to use that time to upskill and work on projects, which could help strengthen your resume too. I don't know much about all this but I was asking around the same questions as you are a few days ago and this is the advice I got. Hope it helps! Have a nice day :)",

Off the top of my head (and this is not a perfect example because it is principally a diversity program, to my knowledge) is Google's STEP program.\n\nTLDR get some projects in, learn Java (C++ is better, but much, much steeper learning curve), and sit your ass on leetcode or hackerrank. The interviews are very, very well-documented online, and there are plenty of Indian dudes making videos about inverting binary trees and getting better runtime with hashmaps on YouTube for you to watch\n\nMost productive thing to do, though, is to get referrals to these places b/c you'll just get auto filtered out since youre '25 and don't have much special to offer. Your best bet is something \"B-tier\" since they're somewhat less competitive but still great experience, or a connection through friends and family. Network is huge for Big Tech, etc... bigger than STEM folk want to think, IMO.\n\nTLDR, grind leetcode, figure out how things are built, and start, like, actually networking. Set your expectations low, though. College app season is just the beginning of you getting rejected everywhere.",

I have some knowledge of those two (java from ap cs and c++ just from high school), but no projects in either. I have research w a prof that used Python though, but I don't know how much that will be helpful.\n\nFor an application timeline, do you know anything about that? I know some companies haven't released apps yet, but a lot already have. I think I might have shot myself in the foot by not having applied yet, I guess I wanted to prepare more but idk. Is it too late to apply now? If not, when should I be aiming to apply by? And is this timeline different from industry? I want to do tech but I think CS in tech vs CS in finance is different timelines.\n\nFor referrals, I unfortunately don't have any. I don't really know anybody in these tech companies, nor do I know anybody on campus. Is there anyway to counter this? I'm not a diversity candidate so I think a lot of freshman-oriented programs won't want me. Would applying to a million places and hope one bites potentially work?",

I would really suggest picking up one of the two, just to be familiar with a non-scripting language.\n\n\\&gt;&gt; I have research w a prof that used Python though\n\nDepends. I'm willing to bet a lot of money you were mainly editing data or just implementing some ML paper. I wouldn't say that either are directly helpful towards this end/ not a deal maker, but the net effect is definitely still positive. They're just going to look at it and go \"oh, cool. XYZ knows a bit about ABC\"\n\n\\&gt;&gt; For an application timeline, do you know anything about that?\n\nChill bruh, you're fine. This isn't investment banking (where this would be the case, but most of those internships have the same grad year filters, etc. The folks I know that are heading down that path -- though n=3, lol -- either didn't have anything or did something at a smaller firm... same shit different industry). I'm not going to be applying to any internships for another month/ month and a half. Hell, I haven't even seriously looked at any applications. Basically, just don't wait til December (and, generally, the sooner the better). To my understanding, this is true across the board.\n\n\\&gt;&gt; Is there anyway to counter this?\n\nYes! Networking! I had my first interaction with a non-class of 24 person like a week ago, and don't really use LinkedIn the way it was intended. You're chilling, don't worry too much about it, but, at the same time, don't get comfortable.\n\nI just happen to have run into people who have similar interests/ scratch each others' backs on Discord -- maybe they're completing an internship and send a message asking if anyone wants referrals to XYZ. I only have direct connects to Optiver, Citadel, and Lyft through these. If I want a FAANG referral, I'm going to have to get through that first round of folk to see if they know anybody who I can \"ask some questions\" about their place of work, leading into a request for referral if it doesn't sound like hell on Earth.\n\nMeeting people who are farther down this path than you has many, many benefits to it, so it's good to do this regardless.\n\nLuckily, these apps are a bit more robot-fill-out-able than college apps are, so applying to a million places is much less of a commitment than it was for you last year, and, indeed, I would recommend that you do this. You're going to apply to 80 places and get lucky if you get positive feedback/ even a sign of life from 2 or 3. Just how it goes.",

Brown has ridiculous success placing kids into FAANG and Big Tech (like, just scroll through the Comp Sci post grad data, realize that the data is far from complete, that a nontrivial number took their intro course as a junior, and consider where the median lies, and I think you will be able to dispel your discomfort in this sense). People are a lot more reasonable than we ever want to give them credit for.\n\nYou need to stick your neck out there. You're a big boy (girl? something else?) now and need to act like one. Don't worry about not knowing anybody in the group chats... I guarantee you it's only like a solid 10% or less of your class that is actually active in those GroupMe's. Your first real chance for meeting cool people in the CS program is your first day of class -- that's a HUGE advantage you have over literally all of '24 w.r.t. social life, and I know more people who have found a great group of friends than people who haven't.\n\nGo to parties. Cold DM people in GroupMe that seem to have similar interests and so on. Introduce yourself and shake hands/ dap up w some folks on the first day of class. You have to sweat a bit before you can sit back and get comfortable.\n\nProfessionally, it's no different, but you don't have an obvious analogue to class time. Talking to people on forums and chats is pretty useful (especially in CS, I'd really recommend getting involved in some communities online... Linux is a great place to look because there's so much cool shit there to learn about. Just check r/unixporn out TBH... I was between JetBrains and macOS but I'm deep af into Neovim and Gentoo now.............. Really any accessible open source project will get that job done). You build a network and a Github, showing me that you know 1. what good code looks like and 2. have an idea of how big things are built and how to navigate a large code base. I'll also edit again and point out that this is how I met the connects that I have at Lyft, Amazon, and Optiver. Through someone they knew, I met the quant and Google people they know.\n\nIf you're really invested in this, reach out directly on LinkedIn to recent grads who are where you want to be and ask them for advice and thoughts. I don't think I've ever met anyone who wasn't willing to offer some help (hell, I've spent like 30 minutes making sure this post is everything I want it to be/ delivers everything I want it to, and I have no idea who you are besides the fact that you're '25 at the same university); if you really want to get into it, you are implicitly stroking their ego. Maybe they'll know of some backdoor or unofficial thing. Maybe they'll point you in a direction that you didn't know existed.... Maybe they just won't respond at all! The worst thing that can happen is you stay exactly where you are.\n\nTLDR you need to start hustling and start reaching out to people, period. That's all networking is -- being close with people who can get you places and do things for you. Don't be the guy who only calls when they need something, and, really, keep in mind that the worst outcome is no change at all.",

It's going to be very hard for you to get your foot in the door, and passing the interview does not mean that they take you on. Recall what these internships are for. Again, your best bet is some freshman program (which, as we've established, are often diversity programs; for several reasons, the only '24 who I know have some legit work experience from this summer participated in STEP) or trying for the slept on tech companies e.g. Bloomberg, Lyft and Uber, etc.\n\n\\&gt;&gt; tech placement isn't too applicable\n\nI suggest you brush up on what those interviews are like + what exactly they do all day. Tech placement is extremely applicable to this; tech placement is extremely indicative of there being a decent chance you end up where you want.\n\nIf anything, great FAANG placement == a guaranteed backup if you're of that caliber? Really, if you don't think you're going to pass a FAANG interview, Quant is not something to bank on.\n\n\\&gt;&gt; How do I meet people in class? Aren't the classes like hundreds of kids? And when would you ever have time to talk? Isn't it just lecture the whole time?\n\nTalk to them lmao. Only the ones everyone has to take. Outside of class/ walking in between/ study groups. Yes (but some courses will have \"break-out's\" where you're, well, directly working through some problem. CS18 does this. Math1530 did this. etc)\n\n\\&gt;&gt; This is true. I'm scared to go out my comfort zone socially, and that will probably hurt me.\n\nOne way or another, you're going to need to get over this. Like I've said, just talk to people, be a good hang, don't be the guy who calls only when they want something, and good things will come your way from it.\n\n\\&gt;&gt; For later years, however, does it matter much? Like isn't everyone pretty much guaranteed a tech &amp; quant interview at the very least?\n\nHave you heard the saying \"it's not what you know, it's who you know?\" Would say TLDR it's that. Like, sure, you're not going to meet David Shaw or anything like that, but maybe you meet someone who knows someone who knows a recruiter at DE Shaw, etc. It makes life much easier, and you're just increasing your chances of them actually paying attention to you. I'd really like to take a second to point out that once you realize how... not unique you and I are, your work ethic and attitude towards this will change greatly.\n\nNot to my knowledge. If you're top 25% of Brown CS/ ApMa/ Math, you can be confident in getting a few callbacks from first round, so if you're of that calibre, you should be fine.",

Phone interviews at that scale are also going to be costly, and in-person would be ridiculous.\n\n\\&gt;&gt; What is a callback from first round? Does that mean getting it to the later rounds of the interview?\n\nYeah. Big picture, you get past their filters (funny enough, I remember looking at HRT application and the \"school\" dropdown was only like Ivies excluding Brown and Dartmouth, MIT, Stanford, Caltech, Berkeley, Waterloo, and Toronto... believe it's more inclusive now, but point stands), you get some hackerrank , then phone interview, then however many rounds on in-person.\n\nIf you're prepared for the final rounds of in-person, then your chilling throughout. But, you're right, quant is really going to be the cream of the crop. Nonetheless, another chance at proving yourself is not a bad thing, and you can't get to the final round if you don't get through the first ones. Considering how early you are with this, if you can past the filter and the first rounds of this bullshit, you'll be well set to get past the later parts of the bullshit later on.",

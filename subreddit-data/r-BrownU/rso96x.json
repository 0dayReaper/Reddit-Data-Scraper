    "postText": "Hey everyone, I was originally set to take CS22 in Spring. However, from the horror stories I've heard, I've been considering any possible alternative course-wise to fulfill the foundations requirement for my CS degree. \n\nOn the guide for the CS A.B., it states that Math 1530 can fulfill this component of the degree requirements. \n\nI was wondering - would I be missing out on anything pivotal by opting to take abstract algebra instead of CS22? \n\nIf any of you have taken these two courses, would you say that one was significantly harder than the other?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. Hope you're all enjoying your winter break!",

            "comment": "I found both courses to be about the same difficulty but took 1530 2 years after 22, so I had more experience heading into 1530. I don\u2019t think it would be worthwhile to take 1530 instead unless you are interested in higher level math. \n\nBoth classes are proof heavy but 22 probably expects less math experience (you spend a lot of time on set theory which is done in about 1 week in 1530)",

If, however, you are interested in abstract you might enjoy the class more than 22 where there are a variety of subjects covered, only some of which overlap with 1530.",

Abstract algebra definitely interests me but I guess my biggest goal here is to mitigate the difficulty of my Spring schedule (I'd be taking 22/1530 in addition to an APMA and another CS class). Do you have any advice for doing well in 22? I'm also considering just taking it S/NC.",

            "comment": "Hi! I would caution that 1530 will almost certainly not be easier than 22, so if you're looking to take it for that reason, then I'd recommend 22. (To be honest, I think a lot of the panic surrounding 22 is a bit overblown\u2014it's not an *easy* course, but if you take advantage of TA hours and give yourself enough time to do the homework such that you are able to develop good proofs, you'll do fine. The material itself is not super esoteric, and most people who don't like it are turned off by the mathy aspect of the course. Plus, I know some of the TAs next semester, and they're *awesome*.)\n\nI took Abstract Algebra and it was the one of the most difficult courses I've taken, and not something that I'd recommend taking as a way to get out of 22. This of course was just my personal experience, and it depends on the professor to some extent (I had a professor who gave tests that were harder than average), but definitely don't go into Abstract Algebra thinking it'll be easier than 22. It for sure won't be easier, could likely be harder, and there's a lot less TA support because the math department is smaller. However, I will say that I found the material covered in 1530 super interesting.",

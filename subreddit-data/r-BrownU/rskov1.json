    "postText": "So I read a few weeks ago about Cornell rejecting people whose applications gave any indication of having depression/mental illness. I can link the article if requested. The former AO in the article said it was because they didn\u2019t want that kind of burdened student to be going to Cornell or smth along those lines. Ofc the student body when they found this out was furious. I have no doubt Brown students fully support people with mental illness and are super accepting and all that. But the article makes me feel like my entire application may have simply been tossed as soon as I mentioned depression\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve been agonizing over why I was flat out rejected and not deferred (at the risk of sounding grossly vain) at the very least and I\u2019ve reflected on the weaknesses in my app but I\u2019m wondering if it had no chance at all because I mentioned calling the suic*de prevention lifeline?? It was literally only in one sentence. And in my additional info I had to include explanation about why my grades dipped last year due to mental health\n\nIk that admin isn\u2019t great with mental health services and all that but do current students feel like this might be something that Brown admissions could do? Asking so I know for future apps",

            "comment": "So sorry to hear about your rejection. I wouldn\u2019t think too much about getting rejected vs getting deferred, since most applicants this year got rejected. Until last year, Brown used to deferred more ED applicants than they rejected. But this year they rejected 60% of applicants and only deferred 25%. Dean of Admissions Logan Powell said this about it: \u201cwe want to be clear with (rejected) students that we\u2019re making the same decision now that we would be making in March. If we don\u2019t see that there\u2019s a path to admission now, as difficult as it may be, we still want to give them some clarity on their college options.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no way for any of us to know whether your mention of depression was a factor in the decision. I find that Brown as a whole (especially the student body) is pretty understanding of mental illness. However, I can unfortunately imagine how a mention of suicidal ideation might worry AOs. Whether it\u2019s Brown, Cornell, or any other school, the truth is of course that people do not want a student at their school to commit suicide. \n\nYou said that the suicide hotline was just 1 sentence in your essay; if it\u2019s not essential to the overall message, maybe you could consider removing that sentence. Calling a suicide hotline is nothing to be ashamed of and it\u2019s terrible that you even have to consider removing the sentence because of the stigma. But at least if you remove it, you won\u2019t be left wondering whether keeping it in might have affected your regular decision apps. \n\nRegarding your additional info I definitely think it\u2019s fine to leave in the explanation that mental health caused your grades to dip. It\u2019s better to talk about it than leave it unexplained. You can also talk about how you recovered and are in a better state now (I hope!) I think that sort of information (which is pretty common in applications) is not as likely to cause alarm among AOs than the mention of suicidal ideation. \n\nWishing you all the best with your future apps!",

            "comment": "I just got accepted during ED but I also did hint about my depression and suicidal ideation in my common app essay. But I made sure they weren\u2019t that explicit and the majority of my essay was about recovering (in reality I still haven\u2019t quite recovered, am still trying). So my guess is maybe mental health issues does ring a bell, but if you do it subtly you can get away with it? On another note, do you mind posting a link to the article? I\u2019m interested in reading.",

    "postText": "I need a computer but can't afford one. Brown's website says they can increase the cost of attendance to include the price of a computer so you can use excess outside scholarships or student loans to buy one. My question is, if you qualify for full financial aid and they update your cost of attendance to include a computer, shouldn't the Brown scholarship cover that? additionally are there any other ways to receive funding for a new computer through the school?",

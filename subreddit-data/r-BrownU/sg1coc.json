I\u2019m interested in ML/AI pathway, and haven\u2019t taken a class in that field yet, so this is my chance to get a sense of the pathway. My goal would be to choose from the two to get that sense.\n\nAdditionally, I haven\u2019t actually taken APMA 1650 or any probability/statistics class yet. Which class may be better to take given this lack of a prereq?\n\nI am also looking to see if the projects could help with doing research here at Brown and if they could be put on my resume (professors for both class already have research opportunities). \n\nLastly, my only concern is workload as I am already taking CS 32 and another math class.\n\nAny input is appreciated and thanks so much for your response!",

If you are doing the AI/ML track then I would recommend DL first. It is a more general class and you will come out being able to use Tensorflow. It also has a unit on Convolutional Neural Networks - which will give you a taste of computer vision and might help you decide if you want to take vision afterwards.",

The size of the rooms are pretty spacious, the building connects to the v-dub so you don't have to go outside in the winter to get food (and Andrews is only a very short walk away), semi-private bathrooms, great location on campus, and (reasonably) nice lounge spaces (if you don't trash them like we did).",

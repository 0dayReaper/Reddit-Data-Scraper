    "postText": "Hey guys!\n\nSo I\u2019m an (international) incoming freshman and was just going through the classes - do y\u2019all think I should take 5 classes or stick to 4? Was choosing between: \n1. Econ - 110 (have a 5 in ap micro and 4 in macro)\n2. Math 90/100 (not sure what to take)\n3. CS 111 as I have no experience in it and think that it\u2019ll be easier than 150? Plus I don't wanna spend too much time on it.\n4. IAPA 110/Pols 10/400. (4 in ap comp gov if that matters)\n5. ENGN 0090 (Entrepreneurship)\n\nDo y\u2019all think this is too much work or is it manageable? Was also wondering if taking the entrepreneurship course in my 1st semester wasn\u2019t worth it as I\u2019ll have a long time before I would possibly declare it as a certificate and idk I might even double concentrate! Any advice would be helpful!\n\nIdeally, econ 110, math 100, cs 111, iapa 110 and engn 90. Potential concentrations are econ/econ apma/iapa/pols (dont think so as iapa is way more open)/something else?\n\nThanks!",

I know far too many freshmen who have taken on too much work in their first semester and regretted it. Take 4 first, see how you do, then if you have enough free time your first semester, do 5 in the spring.",

It also isn\u2019t \u201centrepreneurship.\u201d If I were to rename the class, it\u2019d be \u201cIntro to Case Studies\u201d\n\nEcon 110 AKA \u201cPrinciples\u201d - Hard to ace/hard to fail (as with almost all intro courses at Brown)\n\nCS11 - Honestly, this can take quite a bit of your time if CS doesn\u2019t just \u201cclick\u201d for you. However, it\u2019s hard to ace/hard to fail. I don\u2019t think anyone fails this either.\n\nMath 90/100 \u2014 I didn\u2019t take these here, but I tutor calc. They\u2019re standard math classes. You\u2019re expected to learn concepts pretty quickly. I wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re hard to ace/hard to fail like other intros because you can fail if you fall behind without receiving help, and you can also ace these courses quite easily if you\u2019re diligent and focus all your time on them\n\nIdk about IAPA sorry :(\n\nNote that u can always take a course and drop it later",

Sometimes Profs. change but intro courses, in general, are big by design and have several sections altogether. That econ course has I think over 20 sections so it becomes near impossible to have office hours with faculty. TAs do most od the grading too.\n\nNow, most of Brown classes skew small and you get you meet your Profs. and can see them as much as you want. This makes it so they skew more populat than intro courses.",

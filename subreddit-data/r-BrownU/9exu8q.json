    "postText": "I think everyone knows the answer to \u201cMy ACT is low\u2014 can I still get into Brown?\u201d: Well, yes, given that the score isn\u2019t *too* low and other areas of your application make you stand out.\u201d Everyone knows this, yet people still want personal affirmation that they still have a chance of getting in. This isn\u2019t really any different than a chance me question, which isn\u2019t allowed here. \n\nYet I still see these posts everyday. Could we try to limit these repetitive posts to make room for more thoughtful/engaging discussion about the Brown community?\n\nOf course this subreddit will attract prospective students who want to know more about Brown, and I love those types of questions. But questions asking how a certain aspect of their application will affect their admissions chances, that is a question for a \u201cChance Me\u201d subreddit. \n\nCould we simply make a sticky on this subreddit noting that the admissions process is holistic, and that if one area is below average, the admissions committee will be looking to other areas of your application to compensate for that weakness? Because that is really the only answer to a \u201cMy ______ is below average, can I still get into Brown?\u201d",

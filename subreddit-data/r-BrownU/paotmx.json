If you want to eat on Thayer street, that will probably cost like $10 ish. There are nicer restaurants that cost more. In general, prices are pretty standard (nothing like prices in NYC for example) I made it through my freshman year on \\~$600, but if you want to spend no money, (except laundry) you could absolutely do that.",

It's really only laundry (and maybe small occasional expenses like toothpaste) that the school doesn't provide. That being said, I used to spend a few hundred dollars a month outside of school on bubble tea and lunch (if I was sick of school food) and that was plenty!",

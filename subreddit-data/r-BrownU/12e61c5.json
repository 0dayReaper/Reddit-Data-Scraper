    "postText": "Hi! I was recently accepted into Brown and was wondering about the strength of the chemistry department. I think I want to major in Chemistry and eventually go to grad school, but not any professional track like med school. How good is it? I have to choose between Brown and Stanford, and I'm really leaning towards Brown, but looking for more input. Thanks!",

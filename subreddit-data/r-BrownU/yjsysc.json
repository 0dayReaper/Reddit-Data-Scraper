            "comment": "Taking ECON1110 right now with Prof. Dal Bo, completed up until BC Calc in High School, maybe if you have other classes about 1110 then I can help answer those. As for 1130, I'd echo what lightemperor said that I don't think 1130 is necessary really at all over 1110 but that 1130 IS super useful for practicing writing mathematical proofs &amp; learning math beyond the basics of multivariable calc. That being said, there are plenty of other courses later on (Econ 1620, Apma 1650, Econ 1629/1630) that will bring in those proof skills regardless. \n\nAs the names imply: the two courses are very similar except 1130 involves just a bit more math, so, if you feel prepared for practicing proof-writing and multivariable stuffs and were looking at 1110 you might as well be looking at 1130 as well. At the end of the day, the most important thing about whether YOU should be taking 1130 this semester is how that effects when the rest of the 1000s level ECON courses will open up for you or whether there's another class you might really wanna spend that time on instead.\n\nHope this helps, feel free to reach out (@bbradz on ig), and good luck",

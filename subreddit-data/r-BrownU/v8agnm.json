Main focus of the questionnaire is to find a roommate who you'd work well with (in terms of sleeping habits, substance use etc.). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, if you do have a medical condition that requires a private bathroom, I'd contact [SAS](https://brown.edu/seas) asap to start that process.",

If you select quiet housing, you\u2019re more likely to be put in metcalf/miller, and if you select sub-free you\u2019re most likely to be put in andrews. metcalf/miller are small and have single-person bathrooms on the floor, but are still technically shared by the full floor. there is unfortunately no way to be put in emwool or mochamp, which are the only dorms with all semi-private bathrooms",

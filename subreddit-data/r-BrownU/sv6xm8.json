    "postText": "I know Phi Psi and Sigma Chi have been suspended from campus for several years, but I hear they are both currently (unofficially) active off campus and recruiting, with rush activities etc. How does this work? Do they really have an organized group? Are they trying to regain their charters, are they doing community service, in contact with the national organizations, etc, or are they just a bunch of guys that like to party? How many members do these groups have?",

If you knew anything about the system you would know that Yes, as a requirement for maintaining a charter the organization has to do community service. I was just trying to find out how active they actually were because I\u2019m concerned about my boyfriend \u201crushing\u201d these organizations. If you do t have anything useful to add you can just scroll by. Being obnoxious is not helpful (except to show everyone what a douche you are.)",

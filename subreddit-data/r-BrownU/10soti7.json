It looks like the \"auxiliary housing\" for grad students listed on Brown's website is *only* for graduate students, correct? I couldn't share an apartment with my non-student partner? Are the \"River House\" apartments the same?\n\nWhere do people recommend looking for off campus housing, and could anyone provide any insight into the financial aspect of it? (Roughly how much is rent for a 1-bedroom apartment, how much was due for you at signing?) Any advice is appreciated, thanks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Edit: Also, how far in advance before moving in do people start looking for apartments / signing leases?\\*\\*",

It also depends on when you wanted to move in during the summer or not.\n\nI would just hop onto GSBB and look at the emails. It's pretty obvious when things start kicking up, but starting early never hurts. The GSC probably still maintains a Wiki list of known problematic landlords (and possibly good ones); you need your Brown account to access this.",

I paid security and first months rent at signing. In my experience at least, I feel like apartments go quickly and they don\u2019t tend to want to \u201chold\u201d for you. For example, I was looking in June for an august move-in and they wouldn\u2019t hold so I paid for July as well. There are a TON more listings come summertime- the leases tend to go on the school year schedule. I\u2019m a first year grad student, feel free to message me!",

            "comment": "Most people live within a 5-20 min walking distance. 1bds go from 1300+, usually around 1500, while 2bds go from 1500 to 2000+. The closer you get to brown, the more expensive the housing is. \n\nGetting an apartment in an apartment building is much smaller yet much more expensive (a 400 sqft studio is 1800 in an apt building compared to my massive nearly 1,000 sqft 2bd apartment for 1500). However, you will have an easy time living in apt buildings: maintenance will be on demand, there won\u2019t be issues with heating or appliances, you know you will be getting a clean, safe, functional space. This may not be the case for individual apartments in houses owned by landlords - you may get places where the heating breaks, are weirdly laid out, with terrible management, or shitty appliances. You really should see these apartments before renting, especially if you\u2019re trying to save on rent.\n\nFrom that, I advise working out a short lease with an apartment building (or a sublet from Facebook), and then spending some time looking at apartment showings to find a cheaper &amp; bigger space that\u2019ll fit you much better.\n\nStart looking at least 1-2 months before move in date. People sign a lease usually 1 month in advance. You can look on Zwillow, apartments.com, Facebook, and craigslist. Oddly enough I\u2019ve found all my favorite apartments so far off craigslist, but be careful of scams (don\u2019t pay any money until you sign a lease, except possibly a 10-20$ application fee). This is where seeing the place in person is important \n\nLandlords may try to charge you first, last, and security upon moving in, but this is illegal under RI housing law. You can only be charged two months rent upon moving in.\n\nI lived in river house during covid. It was fine but incredibly small, and not very walkable you brown. You\u2019d take the shuttle, which worked but was annoying to schedule around. I prefer being able to walk whenever I want &amp; then use the on call shuttle if I ever need to",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I'm an international prospective student who plans on studying Computer Science. I'm considering applying to Brown for my ED this October. Can you guys give me some reviews on the CS major at Brown, please? I've read some coments on this matter but they are all from years ago so I want to know more about how it has developed since, from the current undergraduates' povs. \n\nHow are the CS community, classes, and faculty here like? Are there good research opportunities? And are there co-op/internship opportunities? And if possible, what can I do in Providence for fun?\n\nThanks a lot in advance!",

            "comment": "The CS classes and faculty are wonderful. We have a huge range of classes and all of them are excellent. While some are much more difficult than others, I have not taken a low quality course in CS in my four years here. \n\nThe community is... less great, but definitely not awful. With 1/5 of the student body, we have our fair share of codebros. Some people are also very competitive, which feels really out of place here at Brown. For the most part though, Ive had positive experiences, especially as the classes become smaller and more specialized. Research is also very easy to get into here at Brown. Its happening constantly and many professors will take on any interested students. I can\u2019t speak to the internship experiences personally, but I\u2019ve heard positive things. \n\nProvidence is a nice city. It has a decent music and bar scene, and some cute shops and activities. There is also a ton of good food. Plus, other big cities are just 1-2 hours away by train. \n\nI hope you apply here! Its been an incredible experience, and the open curriculum means you only learn about things you care about.",

I was wondering if there were any international applicants from 2020/2019 who wouldn't mind me asking them a few questions. \n\nAlso, does Brown like it when specific classes are mentioned in their supplements? Because I heard some schools hate it and didn't know what Brown's position was. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

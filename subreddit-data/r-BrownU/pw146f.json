From their eyes, I had lots of academic potential but didn\u2019t have the resources to do what most Ivy kids do such as take 12 AP classes and have internships and research. \n\nYou have to show to the admissions that you are unique, will assimilate well with the Brown community, and have great academics in the context of your school.\n\nOut on a limb here, but I don\u2019t think any hicks apply to Brown haha. But anything that is unique is good. Playing piano very well (*and doing something with that*), immigrating to the US as a child, cited research. And if you don\u2019t have that, that\u2019s fine. Your personality is your biggest asset.\n\nI did not end up going to Brown. I went to U of Iowa instead due to their bad financial aid for families with businesses.",

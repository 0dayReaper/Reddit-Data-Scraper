    "postText": "As we know, Brown hasn't been calculating GPAs on our transcripts for like 40 years or something, but I'm applying to grad school during this cycle and wanted to ask - have any alums had experienced reporting your grades and GPA to schools for applications? Brown provides a [legend](https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/registrar/academic-records/academic-transcript-legend) to calculate the number of units and whatnot, so I used that to calculate mine based on the 4.0 scale. I'm just worried that without the numeric value listed at all on my transcript, it will seem questionable plus my Brown GPA kinda helps offset some other weaknesses on my app, lol, so I really want to have this number on there!",

            "comment": "When I applied to grad school, I used the following scale: A = 4, B = 3, and C = 2, with each class being worth one credit. So for example, if you got half A\u2019s and half B\u2019s, your GPA would be 3.5. I doubt anyone will ask about this, but if they do, you can explain it.",

My undergrad GPA from UC Irvine is clearly depicted at the bottom on my transcript, so I was just worried that admissions committees would consider it problematic. I might be too paranoid at this point lol I just really want to make sure I\u2019m in a decent position for these apps! Ironically I\u2019m not applying to Brown haha",

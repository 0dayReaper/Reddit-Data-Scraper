    "postText": "Hey! I was recently admitted to the visiting student program here. I am so eager to join Brown\u2019s dynamic community and to explore some of my academic interests while I\u2019m away from my primary institution.\nHow is the sociology/anthropology curriculum here? Are there any standout professors? Also, is it difficult to join a club (like, do you need to apply)? What\u2019s the social life like here?\nCan\u2019t wait to spend my spring in Providence. :)))",

            "comment": "Imo, fall is the best time to be a visiting student when it comes to most clubs since that\u2019s when the major club fairs/orientation events happen. However, most clubs are a \u201cjust show up and you\u2019re in\u201d type of thing. As for your question regarding professors/classes, one of the great things about Brown is shopping. Our add/drop period is longer than most schools (like 3 weeks), and it\u2019s common for students to sit in on multiple classes at a time to see which professors/classes they like best before finalizing their schedules.\n\nI\u2019m aware that this year there will be some new transfers starting in the spring, so I\u2019d link up with them if you want to meet people in the same situation as you.",

    "postText": "Hello.\n\nI am a current undergraduate that spent time working for the Brown Pre-College program this past summer, and I wanted to ask about the Linguistics Ph.D program and whether anyone here has had experience with it, as I am considering applying to it for the Fall of 2023.\n\nAt the present, I am a senior studying both economics and international affairs, and I am hoping to use the linguistics program at Brown to further research both topics and improve my ability to utilise the languages I have studied up to this point, such as Chinese, Spanish, and Korean.\n\nI understand that the experience largely depends on the professors and department that I am involved with, but I just wanted to ask about it so that I have a better understanding and some perspective before going into the application process.\n\nThank you for your time.",

            "comment": "Do you have significant experience with linguistics, not just with foreign language learning? If not, I don't really think a linguistics PhD of any sort is going to be the right fit for your goals. \n\nI was a TA for Intro to Ling for a couple of years, but I wasn't a ling concentrator and was never interested in ling grad school so take this with a grain of salt: The profs in our linguistics department generally focus more on semantics or psycholing with very little overlap with international affairs (our sociolinguistics prof is actually in the Slavic Studies department, not the CLPS dept) and almost no dedicated interest in economics. If you really want to do a Brown program, why not look into programs offered by the Watson Institute, since that sounds very in-line with what you want to do?",

If so, is it paid and is there any tuition waiver? \n\nWhat other on campus or academic jobs (like TAships or tutoring) options are available to international masters students?",

I\u2019m currently a TA in the CS department and maybe 1/4 to 1/3 of our course staff is made up of international students. This is roughly true in other departments (eg, APMA, though not so much MATH. Can\u2019t speak to PHYS).",

But from reddit i found out that, a professor mentioned that the cost of attendance is actually 35K$ per year, and the website was actually showing the wrong price. He also attached a document to showing the tution fee rolled out by the brown university.\n\nCan someone who is currently a graduate student at brown in the CS department please confirm or shed some light into this.",

Most CS courses have a 8:1 or 10:1 student-to-TA ratio, and approximately 3/4 of all CS grads TA at some point. I\u2019ve personally had wonderful experiences being a CS TA and being in courses where fellow UTAs (undergraduate TAs), who are often my friends, have helped me out. It\u2019s paid and we\u2019re hoping to make the pay much more competitive (CS TAs are unionized and bargaining), although it\u2019s quite reasonable right now. \n\nResearch is also quite prevalent - folks I know have generally been able to email profs and get involved.",

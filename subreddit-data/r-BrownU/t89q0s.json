    "postText": "For a variety of reasons I was not able to submit a video portfolio, which I recognize looks pretty bad but I'm wondering whether it'll completely screw me over from having a chance of being accepted into the program. Most BS/MD programs place a considerable emphasis on interviews/etc but iirc brown doesn't require but encourages applicants to complete a video portfolio for plme, so it seems they do not value this as much as other institutions in the application process",

    "postText": "So I\u2019m going to be taking my chemistry placement test soon and I was wondering how difficult it was since I couldn\u2019t really find a lot of info on it. Do you think the chem-web is helpful for preparing for it or what would you recommend? I also want to take chem 0330 but I\u2019m worried that I might not be ready for it since I would have to take o-chem right after. Taking o-chem second semester of freshman year seems brutal. Is it that bad? Should I delay taking o-chem by just taking chem 0100?",

As for difficulty, I think the class is fine as long as you take advantage of the resources, go to office hours/problem solving sessions.",

    "postText": "Hi! I asked about this here once but I\u2019m doing so again, hoping for some additional opinions :)) \n\nI\u2019m a prospective Brown ED applicant, but after taking the Duolingo English Test 7 times already, it still hasn\u2019t been certified (couldn\u2019t appeal, twice it was my fault). I contacted the admission office but haven't received any response, and since the decision is a matter of two days, I\u2019m, to say at least, in a hurry :/\n\nCould I apply first and submit my results later? (f.e. send the results on the 2nd of November since Nov 1st is the earliest I can write it once again?)\n\nThank you so much in advance!",

    "postText": "Hey fellas, I'm trying to plan out my next two semesters, and I've found that I have two different options as to how I could take on my required courses. Which path seems better to you? \n\nOption A:\n\nSpring 2022 - \n\nCSCI 0200 (Similar to CS18)\n\nCSCI 0220 (S/NC)\n\nAPMA 1650\n\nHumanities Course\n\nFall 2022 - \n\nCSCI 0320\n\nCSCI 1410 \n\nHumanities Course\n\nHumanities Course\n\nOption B: \n\nSpring 2022 -\n\nCSCI 0200\n\nCSCI 0220 (S/NC)\n\nHumanities Course\n\nHumanities Course\n\nFall 2022 - \n\nCSCI 0320\n\nCSCI 1410\n\nAPMA 1650\n\nHumanities Course \n\n\nFrom those of you who have taken CSCI 0320, how difficult is it to attain an S in the course? Any input greatly appreciated.",

            "comment": "Three things worth considering:\n\n1. Your math background. If you have a solid background in math you might find cs22 and apma1650 to be alright in one semester. I am not such a person and would have been absolutely miserable doing both at once.  \n\n2. Your year/experience level. CS32 + CS1410 is at least nominally a higher workload than CS200, but you'll also be much more experienced with college by then, so some of it balances out. Assuming you're a first-year, there's probably still a lot of acclimation for you to do, and you'll be much more confident by second-year fall; on the other hand if you're already a second-year you're mentally prepared for a full workload by now. \n \n3. Who is teaching the course? 22/1650/1410 all switch professors frequently, and if you look at the Critical Review they are definitely not equal in quality.",

I'm a first-year transfer. I did as well as I wanted first semester but I was still constantly stressed. My philosophy for CS32/1410/1650 is that, since 32 is mandatory S/NC, 1410 and 1650 will be the only STEM courses I need to worry about doing exceptionally at. I know that the systems courses are notorious but 32 seems project-oriented, well-taught, and comparatively manageable next to 30 and 33.",

                            "comment": "I did horribly in Calc, for context, and 1650 was manageable, so it probably won't be too bad for you. Not fun but manageable at least. And it looks like your plan is to take CS22 S/NC so you'll probably be fine there as well so long as you put in the time and go to hours when you're stuck. One word of caution is that CS22 can kind of be \"either you get it or you don't\" in that if the solution clicks you're in and out in an hour but if you get stuck, the hours spent really balloons unless you get help. \n\nWon't comment on CS32 much as I took the old version of the course, but I have heard that it is better than 33 in terms of workload these days. In case you haven't seen it, two recent students commented about it here https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/ruu7xj/questions_on_cs_32_fall_2021/.",

Of course 1430 and 1410 are different, and really depends on if they make 32 more strict/harder to pass. My experience with 32 was fairly relaxed, and 1430 seemed like a normal 6-10 hour commitment.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I recently applied ED to Brown CO '26 but got deferred. I wanted to ask if there is anyone on this subreddit that got deferred back in their year and was wondering what all I can do before my app is reconsidered for the regular decision season (Brown is still my top choice school).\n\nSo far, I'm thinking about sending a LOCI in mid to late Jan, sending in first semester grades in Feb, asking for another LOR and sending that, and possibly sending in another essay (because my ED essays were kinda trash compared to my RD apps LOL).\n\nIs there anything else I can do (or should I not do some of these things)? I'm also planning on asking my state admissions officer if Brown has any specific guidelines for deferred students this year, but I wanted to see if anyone who went through it first-hand could provide some insight. Thank you so much! :D",

Or is it more common for people to start later ? When does the \"job application\" process start? Thanks for the help!",

I was able to find work with BUDS, which is the part of brown dining services that employs students! It was a wicked fun job making pizza, but I am unsure of whether they will continue this due to the pandemic and increased food safety.\n\nThere are quite a few other options for work your first semester. The gyms usually employ students to help others find equipment or answer questions. There are possibly openings helping professors do research, and after your first semester you may be able to be a TA for courses you took! There are also opportunities in places like the writing fellows and helping students with essays, but I'll be honest that I am not familiar with how those jobs work.\n\nIf you have access to it, try Brown Workday! It is a website that has job listings for students and what that job entails. This website should have instructions on finding a work study: https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/human-resources/how-search-student-job-opportunities\n\nI hope this helps, and good luck!",

Professors usually have some TAs chosen a little before a semester starts. Some professors you only need to email and ask, no application required!",

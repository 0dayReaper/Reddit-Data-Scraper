            "comment": "I got my PhD in math (and was later hired there as a lecturer). I think grad programs are much more about the department and less about the school... I knew very few grad students outside the math department, but I enjoyed my experience there and the people I knew there. So you'll likely want input from Brown language PhDs, not just PhD in general.\n\nAs I understand it (but I can't say for sure), languages is one of the departments where grad students do a lot of teaching. This may be a pro or a con for you; some people in academia want to do research and as little teaching as they want to get away with. I'm the opposite, in that I really enjoyed teaching and pursued (and secured) teaching based jobs after grad school. So while this may or may not be something you want, if you do come here, I encourage you to embrace the teaching side of things... at minimum, any academic job you want is probably going to care about whether they're getting someone who can teach their classes well.",

Thank you so much for your response.\n\nHow did you find the living expenses with your benefits package/stipend? \n\nI am very keen to teach and this something that really interested me about Brown. \n\nAs far as the department goes, though, my problem is that there are people I definitely want to work with but I can\u2019t decide if Brown will give me a solid training. By contrast, my other option is an R1 uni and they seem to preach a more \u201crigorous\u201d learning experience\u2026 as if a phd is not already hard enough lol. But, I\u2019m just worried that I won\u2019t land a job/publish enough if I go with Brown, which seems to have more of a lax department.",

I can say that I always lived with two other people (which helped bring down the rent) and never felt like I was living anywhere close to hand-to-mouth, but I also had some money saved up from working during college, so I had a safety net. Brown grad students are unionized now, so I imagine that helps ensure an adequate stipend, but that's speculation on my part.\n\nI can't really speak to the learning experience (again, that's something to track down graduates of your department for), but arguably the goal of a PhD program is to write a good dissertation, and in that respect your advisor will act more as a guide than a teacher. Ultimately you want to get some teaching experience, learn to do research effectively, and make some connections in your field. The best school is probably the one that will facilitate those things, but the school doesn't decide how much you write/publish (unless your field is one where grad students only co-author papers with faculty).",

After which they frustrated our genZ college lives with their discoveries. Tbt, I must admit that I appreciate you taking grad math at 21(if that's what 20 and 21... meant). I'm an incoming freshman. I could pass by the department and  say hi Prof.",

A few of the lecturers in both departments are trying to organize a Math/Applied Math interdepartmental teaching seminar, so if that is successful and lasts, we might cross paths some time in the future.\n\nI don't think I have specific advice, other than to get to know people in your department, and don't be afraid to ask questions to fellow grad students and faculty. For me, the department was the core of my grad school experience, and having lots of supportive friends and colleagues there (which I did) was really helpful.",

Throughout my study so far, I was very focussed on Algebra so it would be great to see something along the lines of probabilistic number theory in the seminar.  Lastly, thank you so much for your advice. I will keep it in mind!",

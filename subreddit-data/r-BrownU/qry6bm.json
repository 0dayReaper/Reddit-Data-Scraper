            "comment": "It depends. I believe it's up to the individual instructor when to do the lottery. I know for sure at least several of them have done it already this week. After the first round, they generally give the students some time to decide. They do not notify you if you have not been selected. If a student declines, they pull from the pool again. This goes on until the class is full. If at any point someone gives up their spot (changes their mind, scheduling conflict, doesn't go to the first class, drops during shopping), they forfeit their spot and the instructor goes back to the lottery pool. \n\nThis means that override codes go out at a pretty random rate, even into the end of shopping period. I do think you have missed the first wave though. If you *really* want to take VISA100 next semester, you could always show up to class and if anyone drops, talk with the instructor.",

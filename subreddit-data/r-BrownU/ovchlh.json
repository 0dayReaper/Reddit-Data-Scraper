    "postText": "So there's 2 different add/drop deadlines right? One after 2 weeks, and one after 4 weeks. When do I need to cut down to &lt;= 5 classes by? If it's the 2 week one, would I be able to drop down to 5, but then still be doing the assignments for a 6th until the 4th week? Then, before the 4 week deadline, decide whether to drop one of my 5 and add that 6th one back. I know this requires a professor override though, so am wondering how open professors are to this.",

Can't you do that whenever until right before finals week?",

Theoretically you could drop one of the classes you're officially registered for by the 4 week deadline, then replace it with another class but that would incur a registration fee as the other commenter stated.",

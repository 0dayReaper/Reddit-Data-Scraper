            "comment": "Concentration is your major, and it carries certain distribution requirements. Within concentrations, there are different sub-specializations (tracks) that require you to take different classes to satisfy those distribution requirements. So, you might major in political science with a focus on world politics rather than domestic politics. \n\nThe distinction doesn\u2019t matter much, other than from a standpoint of course-planning, and won\u2019t really appear anywhere but your transcript.",

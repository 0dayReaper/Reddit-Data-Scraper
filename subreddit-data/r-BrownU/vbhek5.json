    "postText": "Hi! Incoming first-year student here struggling to decide whether or not to apply for sub-free housing. Personally, I don't plan on using any substances but I also don't mind other people using them as long as it doesn't become a disturbance (smelling like alcohol/acting super drunk or high, etc.) Few questions about things that I've seen discussed on this sub:\n\n1: Does living in sub-free housing as a first-year limit your social opportunities? (i.e. does sub-free housing only contain a specific type of people or are the people generally the same as other dorms?)\n\n2: In general, what percentage of first-year students choose sub-free housing?\n\n3: Would choosing sub-free be seen as a little weird or do people (sub-free and non-sub-free people alike) not care at all?\n\n4: Does living in sub-free housing limit your opportunities of knowing and socializing with non-sub-free people?\n\nThanks a lot in advance!",

I can try to give some insight.\n\n1: I don't think being sub-free will limit your social opportunities more than not going to places where people are smoking. Some sub-free people are fine around other people who do smoke, so I guess that's your decision. I would usually just not show up to places where that goes on.\n\n2: I don't have any data on this, but I can tell you that you're not gonna be by yourself. There's also sub-free people who don't live in sub-free housing and then people who are not sub-free who live in sub-free housing. Then there's people who are temporarily sub-free and so on.\n\n3: In my experience, living in sub-free housing has never felt like a weird thing at Brown. People don't really seem to mind it at all.\n\n4: I think living in sub-free housing will not limit your opportunity to meet or know non-sub-free people at all. You're gonna meet them and be able to socialize with them, but you just won't live with them. Also I mentioned before that there are non-sub-free people who do sub-free housing along with temporarily sub-free people and all the rest.\n\nAlso I think it might be a good idea to point out that not all non-sub-free people will be the same. I've met people who'll take a sip of a drink and be done and then people who'll literally throw up in your bathroom cause they go hard.\n\nI wouldn't worry about it too much. I think college is pretty hard and living in sub-free housing is a good strat because you probably won't have to EMS your roomate when you got an assignment due the next morning. The less you gotta worry about, the better imo.",

            "comment": "There is a decently large sub-free/sub-low community at Brown (who are all there for different reasons) and the main advantages of living in sub-free housing are that they tend to be quieter during the weekends/night (as someone who has lived in sub-free and not sub-free housing) and you're unlikely to be in situations where you're exposed to substances if you don't want to be. Being in sub-free housing afaik doesn't mean you can't use substances, you just aren't supposed to use them in your dorm.No one really cares if you're in sub-free housing or not, I'm friends with people both inside and outside of it. Brown's also unique in that we have a Dean's office in charge of sub-free that I know runs groups for people in recovery as well - [https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/support/substance-use-disorder/dean-for-recovery](https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/support/substance-use-disorder/dean-for-recovery)",

Other dorms have more lively social scenes and you probably get a more \u201cnormal\u201d college experience in terms of going out and experiencing new things. It takes a certain type of person to enjoy living in Andrews (sheltered and more nerdy than the general population at Brown).",

                    "comment": "I agree with this, Andrew\u2019s (the sub-free dorm last year) definitely had a very different vibe from every other dorm on campus and I felt like the culture was a bit isolated (not negatively, just more academic-focused and less partying) - e.g. on friday nights the lounges would be filled w students studying, while in other dorms parties would be going on. This of course isn\u2019t to say that sub-free ppl can\u2019t make friends w ppl outside the dorm, but in my experience my closest friends have been the people living in my dorm and I definitely socially mesh with them better than if I had lived in a sub-free dorm.",

Many of the people I knew definitely used substances (some in their rooms) and it\u2019s so easy to access emwool parties or hangout in other lounges or the commons while still getting to enjoy the Andrew\u2019s lounge for studying. Definitely more nerdy on average than keeney but in a clean, less annoying way",

Be aware that they will *really* try to squeeze you for any money your family has; the usual US rules of \"if your family makes less than 80k, you get a full ride\" do not apply. If your family has any more than a couple hundred USD left over at the end of the month, expect to pay that to the school (yes, they will even charge you 1000 USD/year if it comes to it). I'm currently on a full ride because my family literally lives under the poverty line at home. \n\nMy main tip would be to apply to a lot of schools with high aid for internationals that cost around the same amount as Brown per year. You are likely to get a higher scholarship from them if you can show that other schools of the same cost have given you need-based full rides. \n\nSource: I'm an in student",

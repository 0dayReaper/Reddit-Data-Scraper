    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman and I was wondering how easy it is to cook meals in communal kitchens. Do they have any sponges/cleaning materials/drying racks or do you have to bring your own? Is there any space to store your pots/pans/plates/utensils? Is there a place to sit and eat there? What's the kitchen scene like overall? Thanks so much!",

            "comment": "there will be space to cook and store pots/pans/cleaning supplies, but nothing will be provided for you beyond the space. Most kitchens I\u2019ve been in do have space to sit and eat. I would recommend against storing anything in the communal kitchens, as they are often attached to common rooms where parties are hosted. This does depend on dorm though\u2014 if you live in Andrews/Miller/Metcalf, feel free to store things in the kitchens. If you live in Keeney, definitely avoid it.",

If you do end up cooking, be sure to not count on the fridge coz drunk ppl will eat whatever the shit is in there.",

            "comment": "I cooked fried rice in my dorm maybe once a month (using ingredients I stole from the dining halls). I lived in miller, so I had a nice communal kitchen. My roommate used to make eggs and toast every morning. My friends made hot pot and asian food once a week. It's definitely doable and can be a good way to make friends. I just wouldn't make it a daily thing.\n\nYou have to bring your own sponges, dish soap, etc. I may have stolen silverware and dishes from the dining halls. The kitchens can get dirty, and the communal fridges get horrid by the end of semester (you have a mini fridge in your room as well). There are tables and communal spaces you can eat by the kitchen. When you explore your dorm there are always gonna be some communal areas nearby, which is really nice! Don't go overboard with the amount of cooking supplies cause you only have so much room. Also, the closest supermarket is whole foods. Which is kinda walkable if you're on north campus (andrews/miller/metcalf).",

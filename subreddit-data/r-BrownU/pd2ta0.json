They have one medium sized drawer and space under for a garbage can (that is provided), and desk size was sufficient for me to put a laptop, lamp, and scatter my various notebooks. Had to switch between notebooks though when looking through stuff.\n\nI would just study in the libraries. John Hay is the one that has a Harry Potter feel; most of my humanities friends worked there. All the CS/math/engineering nerds go to Scili basement/3rd floor and B&amp;H engineering center",

I\u2019d head to the scili basement if I had work that could be done locally though (or had math stuff, cuz the whiteboards in the side rooms are dope).",

    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m a prospective high school applicant and I\u2019m wondering about the chances of getting accepted through the ED round when asking for aid. I heard that most students who would've been accepted get deferred - is it the case? I thought that maybe my chances would be higher via ED round since Brown would know that I\u2019d definitely go if i got in. \nIn short - is applying ED instead of RD (as an international) worth it?\n\nSorry if my question is dumb, I\u2019m genuinely curious!",

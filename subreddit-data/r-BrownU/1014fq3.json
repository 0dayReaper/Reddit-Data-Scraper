    "postText": "Hi, I got accepted to Brown ED last month and I had a few questions about studying abroad. I will be concentrating in environmental science.\n\nI checked the study abroad programs that were offered for my concentration, but none of them interest me much since they don't offer an experience that's significantly different from the programs at Brown. I have a specific university I want to study at (NUS) as they have an excellent environmental science program and allow the students to interact with a lot of nature in Singapore as well as the green building project that NUS is working on. It'd be an amazing experience for me to study there and make some connections.\n\nSo, I was wondering whether it's possible for me to petition so that I can attend this program. How difficult is it to petition and what is the process like? I really would like to know so I can start to prepare. How often do these petitions get approved? If anyone has experience petitioning and getting approved would it be possible for me to PM you? Also, do students usually study abroad during their junior year, and is it possible to study abroad during my sophomore year?\n\nSorry for asking so many questions!",

Brown has plenty of courses in my concentration that interest me and I love Brown but I also want to participate in the study abroad program for the experience. It seems like there are only 3 options for studying abroad for my concentration, and their programs are fine but don't seem to really offer anything special. If I'm going to study abroad, I want to make the most out of it and participate in a program that isn't offered at Brown, and the one offered at NUS interests me the most.",

I recently talked to a study abroad advisor at brown about studying abroad at NUS. since brown doesn't have a program there I asked if I could petition to study abroad through another US university's singapore study abroad program and she told me it's basically impossible because NUS doesn't accept brown exchange students anymore (NUS used to have an exchange program/study abroad agreement with brown but it was terminated).",

I'll likely be choosing a program that's already approved by brown since it's a bit late in the year for me to petition.",

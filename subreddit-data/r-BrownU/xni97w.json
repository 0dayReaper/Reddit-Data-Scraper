We're really excited about this new service, and I'm glad it's working out well for you!\n\nI'll share this with the rest of the CCV and OIT teams! They have been working on deploying Open OnDemand for a while, and I'm sure they'll all be *thrilled* to see your post!\n\nThanks again, u/Zeus_Ex_Mach1na!! These kinds of messages warm my tiny grinch heart!!",

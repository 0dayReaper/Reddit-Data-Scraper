    "postText": "(not sure if this will get taken down because it\u2019s not relevant or too long)\n\nhello! although i know that ultimately this decision will be mine to make, i wanted to hop in to gauge some opinions. \n\ni\u2019m currently a freshman at UCSD double majoring in  cognitive science design and computer art, and was fortunate enough to have been accepted to Brown. \n\ni hadn\u2019t expected to like UCSD as much as i ended up doing so, but i\u2019d been on the waitlist for Brown as a freshman applicant, and decided to apply to a few schools for transfer not expecting much. the quality of life in san diego is incomparablely wonderful, and i\u2019d felt like i had really found my group of people in the beginning of the year. \n\nsome more background academically: i want to eventually go into the tech field as a UX/UI designer, and think UCSD could equip me with the technical skills to achieve that. but, my main academic reason for transferring was that i also wanted to pursue an independent branch of tech, which is more ethical design and tech, which i feel like some of the theory heavy courses of Brown could benefit me with.\n\nthoughts on UCSD:\n\npros:\none of the major draws of UCSD for me is that i can graduate in 3 years total with a two degrees (bs/ba) and a minor, saving me a whole year of out of state tuition. on top of that, again, quality of life: stunning weather, the best dorms and buildings in my college, and just amazing things to do near campus. \n\ncons:\nthat being said, i\u2019d only be living on campus for one more year, and would eventually have to move out on my own in san diego, foregoing much of that immediate quality of life. additionally, UCSD\u2019s size makes it really hard to form more meaningful connections with professors, and the colleges themselves can often feel segregated. i also feel like because of that difficulty in forming meaningful relationship, im just another designer produced out of the UCSD factory, where i have faith i can get a standard, well paying job, but won\u2019t have much opportunity to sort of explore the niches that i\u2019m really trying to break into. socially as well, i don\u2019t feel as though i\u2019m leaving much of a community behind, as i was very gradually isolated from the friendgroup in the middle of the year (which is natural ofc!). but yeah a lot of the people i\u2019ve met seem to have existing ties from thruout california, making it a little harder to form new connections as an out of state sometimes, and by the time i graduate college, i\u2019ll only have a handful of friends on the east coast, where i had hoped to originally end up working (but am honestly now unsure).\n\nthoughts on Brown:\n\npros:\ni have always been and still am extremely drawn to Brown for their curriculum and overall approach towards education, and am super excited about a lot of the opportunities i\u2019d want to take advantage of. their open curriculum paves way for a lot of exploring and i\u2019m excited to finally have the chance to take philosophy and ethics classes to really round me out, because while i like learning what i am at UCSD, i feel like i\u2019m neglecting a lot of potential learnings i could get. \nin general tho, everyone i\u2019ve met at brown also just seems really warm and happy and passionate about what they\u2019re doing and id love to be supported and to support that energy.\n\ncons:\nas mentioned, i\u2019d have to spend 3 years there (bringing me to a total 4 years of undergraduate education and an extra year of tuition in comparison to ucsd), and i want to double concentrate too, which means that i\u2019d have to squeeze an extra class each semester until my senior year. this in itself is not a huge problem because i\u2019m already taking extra classes each quarter at UCSD, but i\u2019m scared it would limit the opportunities i might have to explore the open curriculum, because i would be solely filling out concentration requirements. another option i was looking at was independent concentration so that i could truly integrate design, cognition and ethics, but that is definitely a complicated route to get everything approved. socially, i am also a little nervous because i\u2019m scared i won\u2019t make friends as a transfer outside of my fellow transfers (which congrats to them too!!). i\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s definitely something you make of it, but just a little self conscious i think :(\n\nin either regard, i\u2019m extremely lucky to be already attending a good school and to have even had the option to choose another great school. thanks for reading through and would really appreciate some feedback!! :)",

I imagine it shouldn\u2019t be too bad bc it\u2019s not super advanced, but again that\u2019s down to how you do in math in general. I know people who passed MATH190 their first semester and I know people whole failed MATH100",

However, these are usually fairly short and should take you less than 2 hours of actual work.",

I\u2019d suggest scheduling a meeting, going to open hours, and doing research (brown has a website with all the programs) as early as possible, so u can make a plan.",

Other than that, I think it's like most things at Brown: technically possible but a case of can vs should. \n\nYou have to plan out study abroad pretty far in advance, you'd miss out on most of the things that make Brown unique (e.g., open curriculum), and you might run into concentration requirement challenges. \n\nTLDR: Definitely study abroad after freshmen year, maybe reconsider doing it every year",

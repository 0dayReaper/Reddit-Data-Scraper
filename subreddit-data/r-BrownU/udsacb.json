Additionally, Brown has some of the largest collections of various things in the world: medieval books, war memorabilia, and colonial era American books ( though these are held in the Carter Brown, which is\u2026.interesting). Many of these are available to students with the appropriate permissions",

They also often have (or had) textbooks available for use in the library.  I still enjoy looking at the digital archives from the John Carter Brown library.",

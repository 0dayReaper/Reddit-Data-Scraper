            "comment": "I'll drop this comment I wrote from last admissions cycle -\n\n\"From what I understand, it is incredibly rare to get an acceptance rescinded on grades alone (I imagine even more so for an ED acceptance). It is not entirely uncommon for a student to receive a warning if their Mid-Year Report shows a substantial decline in grades, but from my recollections these are largely a scare tactic and very rarely have actual action taken over them, even in cases where grades don't improve.\n\nI would hazard a guess that Bs are almost entirely okay, and that a C or 2 will most likely be overlooked if the rest of your grades are good. Anything below that and you are reaching a point where you would possibly receive a warning.\"\n\nGoing from (presumably) all As to a \"mix of As and Bs\" is not only not a cause for concern but is entirely normal. An admission officer won't even take a second look at it.",

MIT has something like this program. Possibly research just in case they are concerned with your Senior grades. They can rescind your admission but likely not - just continue to work hard. That\u2019s all you can do.",

Just try your best, and on the .0001% that Brown emails you (this won't happen with your current grades by the way, they would have to be much worse), just explain the situation. Rescinding a student is a long, arduous, and ultimately cruel process that admission officers will actively fight against. They aren't going to rescind a QuestBridge scholar because of a tough semester or two. Just take a deep breath. It will all be fine. \n\nFeel free to PM if you have anymore questions. Congrats on the acceptance!",

    "postText": "Currently a senior looking to apply ED to Brown and was wondering whether Brown still offered Polish language learning classes? Looking online, I only see that Brown offers Introductory Polish 0200, so I am not sure if they still offer the base course 0100 and the intermediate courses. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Brown recently hired a new instructor of Polish language, although I'm not sure how many levels she teaches. You can always ask for an independent study! It's not a very large department and professors may be quite open to independent language study. I was one of two students in an advanced Polish reading class a couple of years ago where we mostly read short stories and talked about them in Polish.",

I have a lot of family in Poland and really want to learn the language, and after going on a tour at Brown and hearing about their attention to Slavic Studies, it only affirmed my decision to ED to Brown. Is this too inconsistent in terms of class availability of a course selection to mention in my Why Brown Open Curriculum Supplemental Essay?",

            "comment": "The more niche Slavic studies language classes usually follow a bit more of a lax scheduling plan - usually they have 0100 for one of the two semesters (or once every two years), follow it with 0200, and then will let you go as far as you want, even if it's 1-on-1",

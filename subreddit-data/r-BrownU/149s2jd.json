            "comment": "if you can select a specific building, grad center c is getting renovated over the summer, so will have new facilities, new paint, new floors and all that nice stuff. the other three buildings aren\u2019t getting renovated and are a little dingier, but aren\u2019t significantly worse than other dorms. \nto break it down more\u2014\n\nrooms: \nunrenovated grad center rooms have dingy carpet and chipped paint, but large windows. they\u2019re undeniably ugly if you don\u2019t decorate, but can feel homey if you put in the effort.\ncaswell rooms were more recently updated, so have some sort of composite flooring instead of carpet. some of the rooms have old fireplaces or built in shelves, which can be pretty nice to have, with the downside that you\u2019re sharing the space with a roommate. \n\nbathrooms: \ngrad center you share your bathroom with six people max. bathrooms aren\u2019t very large and don\u2019t have windows, but have separate stalls for showers and toilets. \ncaswell bathrooms are shared with eight people, and are a bit larger / have windows. the showers don\u2019t have their own stalls, which is a downside for some and unimportant for others.\n\nkitchens: \ngrad center has 2 kitchens per tower, they\u2019re small and not the cleanest, but are often unoccupied.\ncaswell has a kitchen in the basement that\u2019s quite large, and is shared by all residents. \n\ncommon space:\ngrad\u2019s only common space is the lounge in grad e. it\u2019s pretty large and has huge windows, as well as a big meeting room and small gym with treadmills but not weights. \ncaswell\u2019s only common space is the basement. it\u2019s a bit crusty / suffers from being used as a party location every now and then \n\nand hegeman is okay, if you like the location of caswell but really want a single, however the singles are veryyyy small.",

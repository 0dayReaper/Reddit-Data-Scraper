I also was wondering when did you guys send your loci and also if it's common for kids to get deferred and later accepted into brown? when I was trying to look up what deferred from brown means, I saw different things between \"you're competitive for brown!\" and \"your chances are like 5-10%\"  rip\n3. How to even handle a deferral bc it's like a 'good' thing but I'm not even sure if it's worth it to have hope lol. like im scared I'll be waiting for the next three months to be rejected and it's...scary and ah just any tips with handling w/ stress in general would be helpful",

            "comment": "**1)** The nt'nl prize type of kids are just ego-ing/ especially, coping with the fact that they did not get in and are trying to suggest to you in some way that it is not even worth your time to try for LOCI (thereby \"increasing\" their odds of getting it); their deferral was probably circumstantial, and they are suggesting causality that may not have been there. Ignore them and care only for what is in your control.\n\nThe idea overall is that you spoonfeed them excuses to admit you. Kiss up to their interests. Yeah, national awards make for great excuses, but there are plenty of others one can dream up. That you have not done much since November is not great but not the end of the world; they understand you spent time writing other applications, too. If anything, spend the next month before submitting LOCI trying to generate some excuse. Your education does not end after submitting college applications.\n\nRemember addt'ly that these people are trying to build a cohort of students, generating/ maintaining a certain environment and distribution of interests, personalities, etc; what they are not doing is giving yes/no approvals like your parents did to your behaviors as a child.\n\n**2)** End of January to mid-February is most appropriate. They probably won't read it until then(?) \n\nAll percentages are low. NGL that you seem to be giving those calculators or whatever any weight is a bit... suspect... Your botched statistical analysis and emotions will only yield incorrect conclusions.\n\n**3)** This is your first trip with kicks in the dick from anything; most of these decisions in HS are very clear cut since nobody is specialized at all, but this is now no longer the case. \"How the hell did person X get in?\" \"How did I not get in?\" \"How did I not get that award?\" \"Did that interviewer just hate me?\" \"Ah fuck this is the one topic I did not prepare for...\"\n\nED deferrals are \"ok,\" but RD waitlists are not. I don't know the numbers, but if you were already a decent applicant and laid out clear, communicable reasons for Brown over its peer schools, there's not much more you can control.\n\nYou'll get used to this. You'll take some L's, but still the sun will rise tomorrow. In fewer words, \"shit happens.\"",

            "comment": "I was deferred ED and then accepted RD. Send a brief (around 1 page) LOCI in the next week or two just saying why you still want to go to Brown and why you applied ED. I think the contents of the letter have almost no weight and it\u2019s just the fact that you sent one which says you\u2019re still very interested. So don\u2019t stress about it! After you send a LOCI, it\u2019s completely out of your hands and you should have similar chances of getting in as if you had applied RD. Remember that most people get in through RD so you absolutely still have a chance. Best of luck!",

            "comment": "I sent my LOCI asap. I would advise focusing on genuinely reestablishing why you want to go to brown without repeating yourself from ur application, following up on recent awards, and clarifying anything in the application that the AO might\u2019ve seen and not fully understand to support ur admission. \n\nUr chances for admission now is, supposedly, the same as any RD applicant given how selective Brown is with deferrals and how high their rejection rate is compared to other schools like Harvard. However, u have the advantage of being an ED applicant. I thus stated in my LOCI how, if I was accepted in RD, Brown would still be my first choice and I would definitely attend. This is a plus for Brown\u2019s enrollment rate.\n\nDon\u2019t be too stressed about it as long as u know u have put ur best foot forward, which I\u2019m confident u have. Good luck!",

Take some webinars at Brown, follow the press releases about what is going on there. Show that you really do want to be there. Don\u2019t just rehash your stats.",

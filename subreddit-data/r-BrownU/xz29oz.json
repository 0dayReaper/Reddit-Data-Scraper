            "comment": "Like... not really nerdy at all. You can certainly find \"microcosms\" of really nerdy folks -- speaking from experience bouncing exclusively btwn math, apma, and cs departments -- but for the most part, no one is really stereotypically \"nerdy,\" but everyone is (generally) very involved in whatever they do. Just as it happens, many students coming to Brown are not coming here for STEM things, or intend to abuse the open curriculum. I find that the majority of STEM focusing students (granted, I don't talk to many biology/ chemistry/ premed folk) are more career-focusing than grad school/ beyond focusing, giving themselves more time to be social and especially to grind e.g. leetcode (though, similarly, you can find a healthy segment on the other side of the coin; this is mostly the flavor in the math department and the apma people who dabble heavily between the two). Kind of focusing on tangents, but hopefully this suffices as an answer to some extent?",

                            "comment": "Despite whatever you read/ see/ hear, off the top of my head, the three most popular majors (concentrations -- interchangeably understood and nbd really cares), roughly -- very roughly -- in order, are like Econ, CS, and IAPA (intl affairs). Then APMA-ECON, History, Poli sci... some permutation of those. One joke is that every ABC here is either premed or in the trifecta: econ, CS, and APMA, and concentrating in some combo of at least two, and, naturally, Brown has a large ABC population (American-born Chinese)... at least, larger than most schools, though perhaps less than other Ivies. Take that as you will.\n\nAlso take this with the grain of salt that I'm abusing the open curriculum in my own way -- only taking APMA, CS, Math -- and with that comes a rather skewed perspective in this particular direction. Notably, though, with open curriculum, you *can* isolate yourself to your pleasing, as I have, though not really by intent. Your freshman floor will be a wide variety but beyond that it's up to you, basically, due to housing lottery system.\n\nSo, statistically, the average/ most common student is ABC or white from a middle to upper-middle class family (I think the most common places I hear ab are New England esp. Boston and surrounding area, NYC/ NJ, Chicago, NorCal, random bits of the south concentrating around Atlanta -- like yours truly -- and SoCal), probably dabbling in a humanities department or two, but probably meaning to concentrate in CS, Econ, Poli Sci/ IAPA, etc. Maybe APMA, more likely APMA-ECON, as odds are that they came here still with the intent of getting a high-paying job after school. Not so many outside of the \"raw/ pure\" STEM things are interested in graduate school, especially PhD. Most people I've run into have few but deep passions, and tend to not have been interested in competition-y things (eg, math competitions, etc) instead more often pursuing some artsy pastime (my big thing is the guitar, for example, though I don't play in any groups here for lack of serious interest/ caring more for opportunity cost). I'll also use the term \"sweaty\"/ \"snakey\" in the same vein as \"tryhard\" -- not really the vibe overall. Most folks wouldn't have pursued e.g. class president in high school for lack of caring/ wanting to spend time on other things they care more about, as minor of a commitment as that is (perspective thing -- at a university, class president is much more time consuming than in high school, and you have slightly more actionable authority). You can, again, find microcosms of it around here, but most people are very nice and interested in having conversations with you no matter who you are (In particular, have been talking to a girl at Yale and it is now very lucid to me that this is *not* uniformly the case elsewhere). A sort of \"we can both win at our different things\" rather than \"only one of us can win, period, and it must be me.\"\n\nYou can check graduation data if you're curious, which lists outcomes by concentration but isn't totally complete/ up to date, though still worth looking at IMO. See here: [https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/careerlab/post\\_grad\\_data/list](https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/careerlab/post_grad_data/list)\n\nAlso maybe DB is worth mentioning if you want a taste of Brown: [https://www.dearblueno.net/](https://www.dearblueno.net/) Not like this is some tightly held secret, but this is our anon confessions page.\n\nIf you have more questions/ want more rants/ etc, don't be afraid to DM.",

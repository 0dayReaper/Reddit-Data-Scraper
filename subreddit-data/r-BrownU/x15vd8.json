    "postText": "So, I first applied to Brown as a humanities major. However I'm currently planning on taking Computer Science and maybe Econ (cliche I know) during my first year. I was assigned a professor in the major I originally applied to as my first-year advisor and we're supposed to talk about course selection. Did anyone have a similar experience? How do I avoid an awkward conversation? Thanks in advance!",

My first year advisor was from the Engineering department. I got most of my advice that year from my Russian 100 teacher. So, even if your first year advisor is not prepared to help you with certain issues, they probably know someone who is.\n\nPeople switch their plans all the time. Some people even switch a year deep into their time at Brown. You're good!",

By the spring semester, he just sent the code and we didn\u2019t even meet, so I don\u2019t think your advisor will mind if you decide to change directions",

You can be upfront with them about your switch and they might suggest taking humanities electives but overall, it\u2019s your education! Hope this helps!",

So, I went on Browns website and found a section where different professors showcased and listed different projects that they worked/were working on, and in the short essay I name dropped a professor and her comp-lit-related project. In my Common App essay I wrote about my love for a particular book and how it affected my life and my passions going forward, so I think those two things helped me with my application as a Comp-Lit applicant (now concentrating in CS lol)",

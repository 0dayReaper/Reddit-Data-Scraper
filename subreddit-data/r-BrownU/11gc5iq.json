    "postText": " My name is Ria, and I am a clinical researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in Boston, MA. I'm writing to share some information regarding a research study that we are currently recruiting for. We are actively seeking participants to study how feminizing hormone therapy affects heart and metabolic health in transgender women and non-binary individuals who are planning to or have recently started gender-affirming hormone therapy.\n\nThe study consists of three visits at MGH across the course of approximately 12 months. Compensation for participation is up to $850 for three study visits. The study has been approved and is monitored by the MGH IRB. For each visit, we cover any transportation (within the US) and parking expenses and provide you with a meal ticket. If interested, please contact me at (617) 724-3572 or email [rtalathi@mgh.harvard.edu](mailto:rtalathi@mgh.harvard.edu), or you can click this link to learn more about our study: [https://rally.massgeneralbrigham.org/study/evaluating\\_heart\\_metabolic\\_health](https://rally.massgeneralbrigham.org/study/evaluating_heart_metabolic_health)",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, admitted to Brown yesterday (Don't know how) and am actually very excited. But I've read things about the university the past day and wanted to hear your opinions on it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I read that weed is very popular at Brown, but my question is: Do people just smoke weed everywhere and if I myself do not do drugs, will I feel out of place, or are people okay just doing it themselves in private or whatever?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) Here is my biggest question:\n\nI know that Brown is very, very liberal/leftist/democrat. I myself am pretty moderate (go left on some issues and right on others). Would I be ostracized for what I think? I don't know if I can say what I think even on this subreddit just to be safe, but are people very vocal about their beliefs? Meaning they will go out of their way to correct me or try to educate me if I say something.\n\nI also tend to have a dark kind of humor. Think South Park but scaled down. Of course, I only have this humor with people that I know (aka my 5 guy friends). Are there people that \\*might\\* have somewhat of that type of humor? Not in public, of course, but in private. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEssentially what I'm asking is, are there any not extremely liberal students on campus, and would I be able to find people that I can connect with? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a CS concentration, if that matters.",

            "comment": "1. Neither I nor my immediate friends smoked. Brown has a stereotype as a stoner school but tbh it's overblown, just because weed is widely accepted doesn't mean it's widely practiced. There's even a dedicated group (SoBear) that is for people who don't do any substances whatsoever including alcohol. \n\n2. Brown has all sorts of students, even if the overall demographics lean in a certain way. It's kinda hard to say how out of place you'd be without knowing your specific views - some left some right is a super vague descriptor. Fwiw I've never seen reactions more extreme than healthy debate except for views that could be exclusionary or hurtful to other classmates (the various -isms and -phobias). Just have a little self-awareness and don't be a dick to others and you'll be fine.",

I definitely appreciate them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am glad about the demographics. \n\nAs for the specific views, the most \"controversial\" ones are that I wish for people in the LGBTQ community not to try and shove their thinking down my throat (like being weirded out about me not putting he/him after my name or in conversation every time) or trying to teach me about it. I am completely fine with them, of course, no hate at all, but just don't want them to try and teach me or make me act a certain way. Just kind of want to stick to my own values and not be ostracized for having them.\n\nThinking about it more, I don't think I have any extreme views, nor do I hate anyone; I just do not want to be forced to act a certain way for someone else. Essentially do not want to have to act PC every single minute of my time at Brown. So the question now is: how vocal are the people, and how extreme are they in terms of putting their thinking on other people?",

If someone jumps down your throat about it, they didn't understand the intent in the first place (personally never encountered this). \n\nWhat I will say is important, though, is try not to be too close-minded to other views in your time at Brown :) you seem very set in your values, which is respectable, but an important part of growth is listening to others and practicing empathy. To be honest, I didn't get the whole pronouns thing before I started either (grew up in a hella red state lol), but after a few years I came to respect the intent behind it and do it myself now. Not saying you have to conform - many people didn't - but it won't hurt to open your mind and just listen. You might be surprised what you learn.",

For starters, I will say that obviously (like with most media) that channel has an agenda to push, and they accordingly pick out a lot of very selective footage and examples to support said goals. In my 4 years, I have never had to deal with a situation like they claim is happening. Is it happening? Maybe. Possibly even likely. Will your average student be forced to involuntarily engage with that kind of situation? Highly unlikely if my experience was any indication. \n\nI'd also caution you in general of formulating any of your political opinions from snappy 15 minute videos. Real life is messy, and nuanced, and even the most unbiased source in the world will struggle to accurately discuss a serious issue in just 15 minutes. Just as an example: one person the video singled out for criticism is Prof. Tricia Rose. One faculty member out of the ~850 full time instructors at Brown can hardly be representative of the entire school - the fact that they can have dissenting professors give their views in the same video is proof of that. Yet the way the video is structured is clearly intended to imply as such. Furthermore - all we have to go off of from that video is the producer's word, a few selected excerpts, and a 30 second clip. Are those actually Prof. Rose's views? Maybe. I don't know her. Can I know confidently from just one Youtube video? Hell the fuck no. I'd have to actually attend multiple of her classes and read her work to form that opinion. The point is, a short snippet of anyone's opinions can be taken wildly out of context, especially in today's disinformation age, and we need to do a lot more due diligence than a video to form an educated opinion.\n\nOdds are good that short/medium form content relies heavily on playing to our emotions with short, reasonable-*sounding* arguments, while missing massive amounts of nuance and omitting or oversimplifying the opposing viewpoint. One red flag for me regarding that video is that they didn't really have anyone in the 'cancel' camp give a thorough justification for why they behave in such a way, or IF the actions seen are even taken in context correctly. Are the protestors right? Maybe, maybe not. But it does make me wonder why a video extolling the virtues of free debate seems uninterested in inviting the opposition to give a detailed explanation - wouldn't you agree? \n\nUltimately, I'm not seeking to take a side in this issue here - that's for you to make a judgment yourself. I just will point out that I noticed some inconsistencies with my personal experience, and that might be reason to dig deeper into the video producer's goals and methodologies. \n\nThere's a lot of techniques that one can learn to better navigate the media sphere while remaining aware of these biases and manipulative techniques (from any side of the political spectrum) and I personally feel like Brown left me well-equipped to handle it. If you decide to attend, I think you'll also come out for the better in the same way :)",

I definitely understand that the video only took the most extreme instances to try and prove their point, and the day-to-day atmosphere is pretty freaking normal, just like in my school and in other schools. \n\nI very much hope that, if I go to Brown (very likely), I will find my people just because of the sheer size of the university, and I hope to gain the knowledge to make decisions and analyze things the way you do.\n\nI will attend ADOCH and make the final decision, but Brown seems to be diverse in opinion, so I think healthy pushback in some parts and staying true to myself in others will be my life there which I think will make me a better person in the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you so much for your insight; I truly appreciate it more than you think.",

I consider myself moderate (fiscally moderate, socially liberal), and there was definitely a culture shock. There\u2019s a joke that the divide at Brown isn\u2019t between conservatives and liberals, but between socialists and Communists, and there is a shred of truth in that saying. BUT, no one forces their views on you. Don\u2019t discount being friends with \u201cvery liberal\u201d people either; my best friends here are much more liberal than me. People also tend to base their identity less on their beliefs here than other places (with the exception of sexual orientation and gender identity, but that shouldn\u2019t be political), which makes it easier to connect with people.\n3.\tYou will have no problem finding people with a dark sense of humor here. The good part of going to a liberal school is that people are willing to broach difficult subjects, and humor is a good way to do that.\n\nYou will surely find people to connect with.

There are people here like you but they\u2019re few and far between. You will find them but its gonna take time and it\u2019s definitely not the majority of the student population. This is a serious decision and brown is not the best social fit for everyone (I realized this a bit too late). It\u2019s not realistic at all to transfer (why would I transfer down from Brown) so carefully weigh your options. I don\u2019t mean to scare you away from Brown because there are genuinely funny people here but the majority are virtue signaling losers who love to call you out for not being as moral as they are. I do think of what life would be like if I didnt come here and I do think I made the right decision but these past few years have been rough.",

The communist/socialist crowd is more found in the humanities if anywhere. I don't think someone who describes their version of dark humor as \"toned-down South Park\" would have problems meeting people with similar personalities/boundaries.",

I just do not want people to try and correct me every time I say something that's not to their liking.\n\nBut yeah, my humor is definitely not for all. I have a friend group that's exactly like me in terms of humor, and the humor is exactly like South Park, wouldn't say toned down. \n\nI just had an incident where that type of humor was used (someone joked about something like enslaving gingerbread men by gluing them down, and some people got very vocal about that joke), and then things became much tenser. Looking back at it, maybe wasn't the best audience for the joke, but I just hope to find that type of audience somewhere at Brown.",

    "postText": "I'm really interested in real analysis courses, with an eventual goal of taking it at the graduate level (Math 2210).\n\nCan anyone say anything about math 1010/1130/1140/2210? For example how difficult are they, do I need to do all of them or if I can skip some, when should I be doing them, and anything else that would be helpful.\n\nI'm a current freshman ('24), and didn't take any analysis yet, so was considering starting from 1130 this fall because I didn't want to have to wait till spring to take 1010. For one, it conflicts with CS 300, but also I want to start analysis sooner than later. Plus, I get the feeling that 1130 will do a good job preparing me for 2210, but 1010 will not.\n\nAny input is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

Idk if going straight into a grad course is the best idea, even if I try to self study before fall starts.",

But you\u2019ll want to self study 1010 (esp the set theory and proof writing parts). Would def recommend 1130, but 1140 not so much. \n\nHappy to answer any other questions you might have about this. You are also right tho that 1010 won\u2019t really help much with 2210.",

I\u2019m still a junior in high school but I\u2019d say Brown would be my top choice (not expecting anything to come of it so I\u2019ll try to not take the decision personally lol). I want to be a doctor and am starting to believe my personality would be well applied to studying some kind of anthropology. I\u2019m wondering if anyone here has experience in this major. You can comment or DM\u2014the more words the better lol:)! More specifically , I\u2019m interested in medical or biological anthropology. I think that this degree would well prepare me for the social and cultural experience of being a physician. \n\nTo anyone who can answer:\n- what has your general experience been like? How difficult are your classes, and how much do you enjoy them? What are career/grad school outlooks for you guys?\n\nThanks!!:)",

    "postText": "Hey!\n\nI'm unsure which of these two classes I should take for my stats requirement. Here are the dilemmas:\n\n1. My Calc background is weak (wasn't too great at MATH100):\n   1. I heard APMA1650 involved multi-variable calc. Does CSCI1450 also involve multi? In which course do you think a weak calc background would be a **bigger** disadvantage?\n   2. I know CSCI1450 has coding components as well; that encourages me because I'm typically better at landing good grades with coding than with math. Does my assumption make sense when deciding between these two classes?\n2. Econ: I might be double concentrating with Econ. On the Econ webpage I don't see CSCI1450 as a prereq; any idea if it'll count towards Econ or not?\n\nAdditional factors in my decision are interest (computational probability sounds interesting to me), small vs big class (CS1450 enrollment is typically smaller), grade distributions (lenient grades/cutoffs vs unforgiving), and time commitment.\n\nI'd appreciate your insights! Thank you &lt;3",

            "comment": "APMA 1650 frequently references basic Calc concepts and tools like differentiation and integration, however, you don\u2019t make extensive use of things like advanced integration techniques. You also won\u2019t be applying that to the same types of problems as in Calc, since it\u2019s a stats and probability course (so no problems with filling a cone shaped container or close analysis of graphs, for instance). \n\nAPMA 1650 does involve multi, but not too much of it. Watch a few videos or read some of Paul\u2019s Online Notes on partial derivatives and introduce yourself to functions with multiple variables and you\u2019ll be good to go. \n\nFrom what I\u2019ve observed, Calc background is a poor predictor of performance in APMA 1650. I knew people with strong Calc backgrounds who struggled a lot, as well as people with poor Calc background who did very well. \n\nI\u2019ve never taken CSCI 1450 so I can\u2019t say much on it, other than that I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s more work but less in depth than APMA 1650. \n\nI\u2019d suggest you shop each class to see which one is a better fit for you.",

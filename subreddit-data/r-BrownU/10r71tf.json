At the moment, I want to concentrate in applied math - econ but I am worried if I\u2019d be able to handle the coursework. I finished Calculus 1 with a really good grade. How hard is the applied math department, good and caring professors, competitive or collaborative?? Any tips and suggestions would be super helpful :)",

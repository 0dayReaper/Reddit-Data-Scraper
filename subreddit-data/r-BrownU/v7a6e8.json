            "comment": "Not an engineering concentrator but I know a lot of people who are. Engineering is generally considered one of the more rigorous concentrations at Brown. For both chem and biomed engineering you'll have to take several chemistry, engineering (obviously), and math courses, some of which have a reputation for being notoriously difficult, including:\n\n* CHEM 0330 (Gen chem)\n* CHEM 0350 (Orgo 1)\n* ENGN 0510 (E&amp;M)\n* ENGN 0720 (Thermo)\n* ENGN 0810 (Fluid mech)\n* MATH 0180 or equivalent (Multi)\n\nI've never taken an engineering course at Brown, but I've taken several chem courses (and have TA'd orgo several times) and some math courses. Chem and math classes can be very rigorous and time consuming. Math classes tend to assign a lot of homework, while chemistry classes might assign less homework, but provide you with problem sets that you absolutely should complete regularly to prepare for tests. Engineering courses will probably have similar or perhaps greater time commitments. \n\nYou'll inevitably have some tough schedules, but you'll also have a lot of support systems to help you get by. USE THEM! Form study groups, go to Office hours, engage with TA's. \n\nI also generally recommend that students avoid taking too many rigorous STEM classes their first semester, as you don't really know what you can handle yet (just because you were a straight A student in high school doesn't mean you'll get by easily here). Details can be worked out with your academic advisor. \n\nFinally, take care of yourself mentally. STEM classes often burn out students. As a TA for a hard STEM course, I tell students that taking care of themselves mentally is a crucial component to their success in the course. \n\nIf you haven't already, here's some links you might find interesting. \n\n* [Undergraduate Concentrations](https://www.brown.edu/undergraduate_concentrations)\n* [Courses at Brown](https://cab.brown.edu/) (list of every course being offered and where you'll register for classes in the Fall). \n* [The Critical Review](https://thecriticalreview.org/) (student reviews for various courses at Brown, including data on hours per week, overall difficulty, and instructor feedback).",

    "postText": "Hello everyone! After consulting an advisor at Brown, it seems as though I'll have to start the intro sequence for a CS A.B. during my junior year at the university. I was wondering - how should I go about securing internships/making myself marketable outside of my coursework? I understand that I'm probably starting everything far later than the average C.S. concentrator, so I'd greatly appreciate all of the advice I can get. Hope everyone's having a great Summer!",

            "comment": "1. Are you sure you need to take the intro sequence? I know you've already talked to your advisor but an A.b. Degree requires 13 credits so if you are spending your junior year doing the intro sequence is it even possible to finish the degree in your senior year?\n\n2. Sign up for Brown's Handshake. It's a website for recruiting. Tons of job postings there\n\n3. Careerlab also has a lot of resource including consultation and resume guidance and a lot of employers will be holding info sessions on campus. If you're CS, I think there's also another email list for industry partner opportunities. If you're overwhelmed just talk to someone at Careerlab and they'll guide you through all the steps.",

As for 2 &amp; 3, thank you so much for the advice! I'll check both of those out promptly!",

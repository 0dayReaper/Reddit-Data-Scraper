    "postText": "Hello, I am an incoming freshmen to Brown and I am really interested in powerlifting. \nI have been lifting for about 3 years now, but the current facilities I am stuck with are very low quality and have very minimal equipment (no squat racks, no deadlifting platforms, no heavy dumbbells) and I have been here for about 2 years so I have definitely not been able to progress with lifting as much as I would like. \nI was wondering what the gyms are like at Brown/ are there any that I can find help/coaching for powerlifting with the intention to compete? So far all I have seen as far as gyms go is Nelson on campus, but I wonder if that will be powerlifting friendly? \n\nThank you !!",

            "comment": "there's a powerlifting community at brown and some of the kids who are more serious go to gyms in the area. you'll easily find people who are into it just by coming into the nelson a couple times. Depending on time of day, it gets a bit packed, but it's generally powerlifting friendly. (dumbbells do only go up to like 100 though i think)",

Just had a lot of racks and very raw materials. I would start by emailing one of the strength coaches and asking if it\u2019s possible to work out there (some of them compete in powerlifting and they\u2019re all very nice).",

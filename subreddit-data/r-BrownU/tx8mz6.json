    "postText": "I was accepted both at Brown and Georgetown's School of Foreign Service for class of 2026, and I'm extremely undecided about which one I should attend...\n\nI really love Brown's vibe and its unmatched community feel, but I'm unsure about its IR and public health concentrations and opportunities. Are there a lot of internship opportunities in Providence? How common (and easy) is it to study abroad? \n\nEveryone has been telling me that I should go to Gtown because DC is obviously great for IR, but I'm still extremely undecided on what I want to pursue and I feel like Brown would be perfect with its open curriculum. I'm thinking of taking pre-med requirements as well, so I'm afraid that going to Gtown SFS would make this very complicated. \n\nIf anyone doing IR/public health at Brown could give me some insight on what it's like I'd really appreciate it. Thank you so much!",

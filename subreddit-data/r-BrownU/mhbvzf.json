I would be interested to see whether browns crime rates have decreased in the time since installation. But I have way too many papers to write to pour through bps data. Anyone have knowledge of this info?",

                    "comment": "It's tricky research to do on a small scale. You'd need to both classify crimes by whether or not the installation of a camera would have prevented the crime, and control for external factors affecting crime rates. Then, if you found an effect, you'd want to do a cost-benefit analysis. Identifying the costs and benefits would be a whole study unto itself.\n\nIt's been a while since I read Brown's crime reports (and they're currently unavailable), but my recollection is that the vast majority of crimes occur in residential spaces \u2014 which (mostly) don't have cameras. Even if Brown could halt all dormitory larcenies by installing cameras in dorm rooms, would students accept that intrusion? I suspect not.",

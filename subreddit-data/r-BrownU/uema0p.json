    "postText": "Hey yall! I'm still trying to decide where to commit and some advice would help a huge amount!\n\nI want to go into CS and I'm trying to decide between Brown and Carnegie Mellon SCS. I know CMU is #1 in CS, and their school is huge and really cool, but it kinda intimidates me and the stress culture there is pretty strong from what I saw visiting. However, IDK how much of that is surface-level stereotyping. \n\nI love the vibe and campus for Brown, the location is pretty great for me, it was my ED choice (deferred then accepted), and it seems like a more collaborative and much more relaxed environment. Again, I don't know how much of that is stereotyping and IDK the real difference in rigor/stress. I'm not a mega open-curriculum fan but I find it interesting.\n\nI have 2 days so any advice here would mean the world to me thank you so much :)",

I know a few people graduating from CMU and life, relatively, is worse. You can explore more at brown and even perhaps do more CS here, not to mention its very strong Applied Math.\n\nWhile prestige shouldn\u2019t be a deciding factor at all, it is at the end of the day an Ivy and way less cut throat! \n\nBest of luck!",

If you want to do more research and go onto PhD, CMU might be slightly better as an undergrad choice (definitely better as a graduate choice).\n\nIf you want to go into industry and climb the ranks, the superior liberal arts education you get at Brown undergrad will pay dividends. I\u2019m in industry and see it regularly with staff+ engineers and directors+\u2014the graduates from programs with strong liberal arts (Brown, Stanford, etc) are more adaptable to solve business problems, write and argue better, and, bluntly, tend to deal better socially and thus politically (it\u2019s a reality\u2014no sense in hiding it). I don\u2019t see as many CMU grads up the chain except for those in highly specialized fields (robotics) where they\u2019ve broken out individually as uniquely gifted individual contributors.\n\nI\u2019m not uniquely individually gifted so I chose Brown.",

In theory Brown's open curriculum should allow you to take more classes you're interested in as opposed to bullshit distribution requirements or whatever. In practice that's sometimes not the case, unfortunately. Idk about CS but as an engineering grad I ended up wasting a ton of time on classes that I didn't really care enough about to put energy into.\n\nI'm also not sure how much of Brown's culture translates into the CS department to be honest. The program is in such high demand that the whole thing is pretty rigidly structured and impersonal, at least at the intro level. CS office hours you have to fill out a form with your exact issue and then wait in a line for a few hours to get your timed 15 minutes with a TA, whereas pretty much any other major I'm aware of you can just go knock on your professor's door and talk about whatever",

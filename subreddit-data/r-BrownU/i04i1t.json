    "postText": "I'm not on facebook so I'm pretty out of the loop on stuff. But it's absolutely insane how few courses are being offered. Am I wrong to be surprised by this, did I miss an email or something?\n\nI'm a 4th year engineering student and pretty much none of the courses I planned on taking are being offered. I mean there are courses in GEOL and ASYR I was considering, and I looked and neither of those departments even exist in the fall? I don't even know how I'm filling my upper-level science req, not to mention what concentrators are supposed to do.\n\nImo this shit is just unacceptable. I came to brown with the intent of taking structural engineering courses that just don't exist right now, to the point where it might seriously negatively impact my ability to find work post-graduation. Not to mention the years of bullshit 0000-level courses I put up with so I could finally get to the interesting shit. This is super fucked.",

I'm really surprised Brown didn't let us know that this was happening or offer a justification for it; I wouldn't have even noticed this was such an interdepartmental problem until I saw your post and ran the numbers just now.\n\nSemester | Number of Courses\n---|---\nFall 2020 | 1105\nSpring 2020 |1597\nFall 2019|1529\nSpring 2019|1538\nFall 2018\t|1493\nSpring 2018\t|1512\nFall 2017\t|1464\nSpring 2017\t|1521",

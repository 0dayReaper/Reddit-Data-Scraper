            "comment": "Personally I'd choose Brown over CMU if they're a similar cost:\n\n* Brown's really well known for APMA -- we're ranked #3 for APMA ([https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/applied-mathematics-rankings](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/applied-mathematics-rankings) \\- these are graduate rankings and US News is flawed as heck, but it gives a general impression)\n* Brown also makes it really easy to double concentrate (APMA also has a joint concentration in APMA-CS, Econ, or Bio) and you can basically change your concentration anytime as long as you can complete the requirements before you graduate\n   * It's also much easier to change your concentration here than at other schools, since Brown isn't split into SCS, Dietrich etc. like CMU is\n* Open Curriculum and ability to S/NC makes it really easy to take electives in anything you're interested (there are like 2000 courses and you'll take between 30-40 before you graduate, so there's an infinite number of possibilities)\n* It's definitely possible to get involved in research if you're interested -- our graduate student population is 1/4 the size of our undergrad population, so professors love undergrads for doing research (I'm only really familiar with bio which tends to be unpaid/volunteer basis, though a good number of people will do a summer UTRA and get paid that way -- you can sometimes find paid positions through Workday)\n* While Pittsburgh is larger than Providence, Providence is closer to Boston than Pittsburgh is to Philadelphia (you probably won't go to Boston every week, but it's nice to have the option + if you're from the west coast or elsewhere in the US it's relatively straightforward to take a non-stop to Boston and then take Amtrak/MBTA into Providence)",

            "comment": "Late, but I would not pursue the Stats concentration here. There is no department, and you'll notice that the requirements are split between PHP (public health -- this should be a red flag, since the statistical methods in public health don't need to be especially sophisticated, as far as I have seen) and APMA (whose focuses are obviously split, and definitely a bit heavier on Diff Eq and Numerical Methods --&gt; scientific computing, which is undoubtedly Brown's forte, though we have some cracked folks working in Stats and Optimization. Darbon, Geman, and Dupuis are three tenured names that come to mind, though they are later in their careers each). I would argue that the education you're getting out of Brown's APMA-CS is far better than an undergraduate \"Data Science\" program, and it's definitely your best point of comparison. One thing that I think most people overlook at your age/ point in life (funny to say that, considering I'm only two years older than you) is that college does not teach you everything; like, that's obvious, but you should view it as training to actually learn everything about something in either a career or grad school. With that in mind, now, one interpretation of a \"great education\" is an education that is going to provide you with several methods of getting a bird's eye view of a problem, and the upper level requirements for APMA will do just that (the lower level e.g. APMA350 are, like, disgustingly easy... especially now that linear algebra is not a pre-req). More tangibly, you should be looking at the program that is going to give you the better basis for (at least tangentially) related research and for properly understanding the algorithms. Having a program jump straight into machine learning methods is a bit funny for that very reason; it forces you to learn a cookbook that severely limits moving forward, and you may as well have just read all the Medium articles in existence.\n\nSocially, APMA has been pretty bad so far, but apparently our DUG (departmental undergraduate group) has actually started doing things. One challenge there is that everyone is doing very different things, and the APMA itself is a bit difficult to commune over unless you're very dedicated to it (in which case you're probably working on something and not especially interested in talking to APMA-Bio premeds and aspiring APMA-Econ investment bankers; they don't know much about your struggles with some FEM solver, and you don't know much about their CHEM exam/ struggles with interview prep on cases, LBOs, etc whatever other garbage they have to know).\n\nWhile this isn't the \"data science things at XYZ are exceptional\" that you're hoping for, don't discount the fact that Brown's focuses academically are placed elsewhere and do note that you're going to get sucked in, to some extent, to whatever the academic culture is at each university. You would seriously benefit from understanding a bit of numerical methods and Diff Eq's in both a very applied and very theoretical sense.\n\nSince the only discussion on research here is an overview that you could have gotten from an out-of-touch AO (no offense, but you yourself admit that you are only familiar with Bio), I know that getting into CS labs here is not terribly difficult, though the CS department is a bit corporate. APMA is case-by-case, but, as noted, it tends to be \"have you taken several classes that are relevant to my work?\" \"do you roughly understand the theoretical ie pure math underpinnings of how we do things?\" (this bit in particular is a bit harder in Stats, because you *do* need some analysis and topology in most cases; however, everyone knows you're just an undergrad and are far from their level, so the expectations are generally fair). It's nothing particularly special though --- you just need to be emailing, demonstrating competency, and drive. My roommate would describe it as \"roleplaying some bright-eyed, bushy-tailed undergrad, excited to get destroyed by the work ahead.\"",

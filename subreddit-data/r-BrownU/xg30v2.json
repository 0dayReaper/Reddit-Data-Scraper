    "postText": "Hi, on the verge of applying ED and hearing some very conflicting things about pure math at Brown.  I was  wondering if anyone could share whether you think the professors' involvement, relationships, and support of students is particularly strong or not?  \n\nI feel confident the faculty will be flexible in terms of course placement, etc.  But are they nurturing and do they help guide toward careers?  Are they friendly?  Do you see them outside of classes?   \n Would love to hear anyone's personal experience.  Thanks.",

The office hours are helpful.  Pure maths class tend to be smaller so thats probably the most important factor determining how \u201cstrong\u201d the involvement / relationship professors are. \n\nI still keep in touch with my old math professors!",

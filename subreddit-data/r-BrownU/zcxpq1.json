    "postText": "I applied to Brown early decision and, while I obviously haven\u2019t been accepted yet since decisions haven\u2019t been released, decisions will have come out before our second marking period has ended. Assuming I get accepted, what grades would be fine to get from the second, third, and fourth marking period to not get acceptance rescinded? I only ask because, in the case I get accepted, I don\u2019t know that I would be able to maintain all A\u2019s for the rest of senior year.",

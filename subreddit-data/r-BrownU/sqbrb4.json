    "postText": "Hey all, I\u2019m an accepted class of the class of 2026 and I am planning to go through the pre-med track. Im currently looking at the course requirements and I am confused about my options for next year. I see that if I take Chem 0100 that I will be practically forced to take a gap since I will finish my gap year late. I didn\u2019t take AP Chem, but I took chemistry sophomore year and I feel pretty confident that I could self study the material for the placement exam. I also have another option of taking an equivalent chem class at my local community college over the summer so I could learn the natural. However, I am not sure if this a good idea because I am scared I\u2019ll be at a disadvantage in Chem 0330 since I would be skipping the 0100 class. Has anyone else been in a similar situation and and done well in Chem 0330?\n\nMy other question is about bio. I took AP Bio and I\u2019m planning on placing out of bio 0200. But I\u2019m just confused about what classes are then open to me to satisfy my pre med requirements. I see there\u2019s a biochemistry class 0280, but are you meant to take that class after bio 0200 or after organic chemistry? What other bio classes have other freshman pre meds taken other than bio 0200?\n\nFinally, I was wondering what a manageable schedule would look like for me next year. I was thinking of taking Calc 2, Chem 0330(or 100), a humanities class and some type of biology/physics course needed for premed requirement that I\u2019d find through the shopping period. Do you guys think this may be too much too handle?",

            "comment": "You should shop both chemistry classes. I was in a similar boat and felt like 100 was important to take first. I think it sets people up particularly well for success in the Chem sequence.\n\nYou take bio chem after the organic chemistry sequence. Placing out of biol 0200 is great there are a number of intro courses you can take your first semester instead.\n\nThe course load seems manageable! It\u2019s good to consider other options as well though to remain flexible during shopping period",

They release a canvas course to study for the placement and if you have a grasp on that content you\u2019ll be as prepared for 0330 as someone who took AP chem. It\u2019s not an easy class but you don\u2019t need that much pre existing chem knowledge.",

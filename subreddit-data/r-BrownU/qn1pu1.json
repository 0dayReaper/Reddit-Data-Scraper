    "postText": "Hey!\n\nI'm considering double majoring in CS and Psychology, both BA's (I'm a sophomore who's been progressing primarily in CS).\n\nBoth departments have a 2 course overlap limit. I've already identified 2 CS courses I'm able to utilize for my Psych concentration. **My question is whether overlap limits can be used applied to both majors**. Example:\n\n\u2022\u00a0Two (appropriate) CS courses count towards Psych. For example, a programming class + stats class.\n\n\u2022\u00a0Two (appropriate) Psych courses count towards CS.  e.g. computational neuroscience courses.\n\nI'm more interested in whether overlap limits can be applied both ways than if specific courses are approved by the respective departments.\n\nI'd appreciate any insights (and yes, I plan on asking an advisor some time soon, but if anyone already has some knowledge with this matter I'd really appreciate it :) ).\n\nThank you!",

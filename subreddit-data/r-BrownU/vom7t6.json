    "postText": "I am an incoming graduate student at Brown, starting in September. I will be moving to Providence next week and am hoping to use the gym. \n\n1. From what I have gathered, the Nelson Fitness center would be the place to go for weight lifting and cardio machines, correct? \n2. Is this free for graduate students with your ID? Are group fitness classes also free for students?\n3. What is the process of \"checking in\" at the front desk? I'm wondering if my card will be sufficient now even though my program has not begun yet. \n4. In your opinion, how is the facility? plenty of availability of equipment, or usually busy?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you so much!",

            "comment": "1. Yes. FYI you also have access to other facilities such as the indoor track/courts in the OMAC and courts in the pizzitola.\n2. Free access to the gym, pool, and the other things above. Intramural teams are also super cheap to join, I forget the price but like $20 for the whole team or something. If I remember correctly you get a certain number of free fitness classes and they are also free at certain times of the year such as the start of the year and maybe near finals but otherwise you pay for them but they are quite affordable.\n3. You swipe your card, might as well try it and see if it works.\n4. The Nelson gets busy, and there can be some waits for machines (probably not now during the summer) but it\u2019s a great facility with pretty much anything you need.",

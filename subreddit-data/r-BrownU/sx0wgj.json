    "postText": "I don't know if this counts as an admission question, mods please remove if it does, I don't want to break any rules. I applied to the Brown/Trinity Rep Acting (MFA) program for Fall 2022 intake as an intl student. My audition (shifted online this year) took place in the last few days of January and went quite well. But it's torture waiting for any sort of communications from the uni. I haven't been able to concentrate on anything at all (I'm a final year BA student in my last semester) and the one thing I religiously have been doing is check my email twice a day and the application portal once every 2-3 days. The Welcome Weekend is scheduled for March 4-6, and even if I get accepted at this rate it's going to be almost impossible to get a US visa at a short notice. Right now I'm at a point where I just want a notification, ~any~ notification would do (even though it's one of my top choices), so if anyone has an idea about when the decisions are going to be sent out I'd be really grateful.",

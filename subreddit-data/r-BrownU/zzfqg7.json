    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m a current Brown undergrad and am interested in the 5-Year Master\u2019s in Public Health program. I will have completed the requirement courses to apply this spring, and was wondering if anyone who is/was a student could share some information about the program (admissions process, suggested classes to take, what the department is like etc\u2026). Thank you so much!",

            "comment": "As a Brunonian, I wouldn't recommend it. It is a GOOD program but it has a very wide age range in its cohorts. There are the young (like you) 5th year masters students who majorily don't know what they want to do for a living and/or haven't gotten a good job offer, so they stay an extra year. SPH has plenty of funds to provide for students they notice are in that situation. But then you have students with 5+ years of experience who are using the degree as a career reset or to pivo industries. Moreover, the alumni base is much smaller than the one you already have. You will also meet dual-degree candidates getting 2 masters.\n\nThe above makes it so that you end up having 3 student groups that don't really hang out with each other. Additionally, the job outcomes are *the same* as just getting your bachelors at Brown with the proper concentration.\n\nGiven all of this, I'd recommend to do this 5th-year MPH *only* if you haven't gotten a decent job offer. Else, go work, travel, get experience and then, 3-6 years from now, get an MPH to pivot or jumpstart your career. Even then, I'd highly recommend getting an MPH at Harvard Chan (or similar) or a top West Coast program (like Berkeley or UCLA) to gain another alumni base + network.\n\nHope this helps!",

I currently have a very good financial aid package from Brown and after speaking with one of the directors of the program I would be able to keep my scholarship for the 4th year while I\u2019m taking masters classes and would only have to pay for that 1 year of my MPH. I will definitely be looking at other programs however (Mailman, TH Chan, Bloomberg) and they allow you to drop the 5 year program if you get accepted into another institution. I\u2019m currently thinking about concentrating in IAPA so I hope I can get some good experience and job opportunities out of college with that concentration if I choose to do my MPH later in my career like you said.",

I cannot stress enough the benefits from another top network.\n\nNote: I was an IAPA concentrator myself. Hows J. Friedman  and Geri Augusto? I hear they'll make Watson into a full fledged school! How are you liking the new building? Do they still close it off on Sundays and only allow grad students?",

The new facilities are top notch and I\u2019m excited to see what opportunities IAPA brings me! I believe the new buildings are always open for anyone, but I could be wrong.",

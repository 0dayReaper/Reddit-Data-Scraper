    "postText": "Hi everyone, I recently got admitted to both UC Berkeley and Brown University and plan to major in computer science. I wanted to get opinions on which school would be the better option. Brown is one of my dream schools but is over double the price of Berkeley so I\u2019m leaning towards Berkeley. However, I still want to hear other peoples\u2019 opinions. Also, the price I listed are the estimated total cost of attendance that the universities gave me in my financial aid offer and not tuition.",

            "comment": "First off, congrats. You have some great options. If I were you and was studying CS, I'd pick Berkeley. Brown is not worth \\`$184k more than Berkeley- especially if you're going to be studying CS. Berkeley is right in the Bay Area. You can easily do part-time internships during the school year and it's a great program. With Brown, you're essentially paying $184k to get the exact same job as a Berkeley grad. Regardless, can't go wrong with either but practically speaking, Berkeley is the better option.\n\nHowever, whenever people make these kinds of decisions, they often get waves of woe and regret when times get tough. I'd write out on a sheet of paper exactly why the financial benefits of Berkeley outweigh any \\*perceived\\* benefits of Brown so when times get tough at Berkeley, you don't start second guessing yourself. I notice people at Brown who regret their decision never did this reflection prior to starting. A \"dream school\" is just that... a dream. No offense but you haven't been to Brown yet. The propaganda by cringy Youtube vloggers/Admissions Office will make it seem like a paradise. Truth is it's not. It is what you make of it. Some people love it while others hate it. So if you choose Berkeley, just realize you're not missing out on some life-changing opportunity.",

My best friend entered pre-CS and had to drop out of the major because she didn\u2019t have the grades needed to declare. If you make it through, you\u2019re set for life, but those four years are likely to be a struggle. Brown on the other hand, a lot more lenient.",

It seems like they actually went to college, the way you read about it in books and movies (community, a place of learning, interacting with researchers), whereas I was kind of just taking classes at a faceless industry for 4 years. Of course I'm exaggerating a lot to make a point, and I'd probably feel differently if I actually went to one of these small schools, but if I could go back now (and if I actually got admitted to a small school lol) I would choose to go to the small school for the experience.\n\nI was a SWE, and in my opinion, if you're smart, pursue internships, and do some competitive programming during undergrad, you'll have no problem getting good to great jobs out of college at either of those schools.\n\nIt's funny because I'm also trying to choose where to go to school (but for grad school haha) so I can definitely empathize with you. It's a hard decision. But also you really can't make a wrong choice here! Both Cal and Brown would be great schools, so you can't go wrong!\n\nWould Brown cover part of the $86k with aid, or would you have to pay for the whole thing? If you'd have to pay for the whole thing then that's a bit of a yikes but I guess you could pay it off by the time you're around 27 if you go into tech? Those are both crazy amounts if they're post-financial aid though.",

            "comment": "fwiw I went to Berkeley and I think that for an in-state student $40k sounds like an overestimate, unless tuition has gone up a lot or you want to live in a pretty nice apartment (spoilers: there aren't very many nice apartments, so you might not even get one if you wanted one and could afford it).\n\nWere you accepted to EECS? If not, are you OK with doing an adjacent major like applied math or data science? If your answer to both of these questions is \"no\" you should be aware that CS 61A is a brutally difficult class and only the top students in it are accepted to LSCS. So, unless you've been programming since you were 12 or something, in that situation you should seriously consider Brown. But if you could answer \"yes\" to one of those questions I would favor Berkeley.\n\nMore generally, Berkeley has a \"sink or swim\" culture that I haven't noticed while teaching at Brown. I thought I benefited from this a lot -- it was miserable and painful, but it gave me a lot of maturity that I can't imagine getting from an Ivy League -- but it's definitely not for everyone.\n\nEDIT: My partner, who also went to Berkeley, reminded me to point out that while there might be more racial diversity at Brown (since Californian admissions are raceblind) Ivy Leagues are a lot more insulated and so if you care about being in a class-diverse environment, Berkeley will be better there.",

            "comment": "There is a website that Brown used to advertise (before BSA disappeared) that sold bedding packages, but I'd personally recommend buying each item separately, since you can ship items to mail services (contact them to figure out how far in advance you can do that, it should be around a month) and it's cheaper. I bought the following from Costco (I don't think you need a membership if you're buying from online) and Walmart:\n\n1. [Bedsheet](https://www.costco.com/charisma-microfiber-sheet-set.product.100800530.html) \\- Buy Queen sized ones, Twin will be too small (beds are Twin XL) and with Queen you can either tuck the extra underneath the mattress itself or let it hang off the edges\n2. [Throw](https://www.costco.com/monte-%2526-jardin-ultra-plush-throw.product.100670929.html) \\- Costco sells a couple of different brands of these, but I have two and absolutely love them - they're warm during the winter, and light enough that you can sit at your desk with one wrapped around you.\n3. Comforter - I bought one from Costco, but I don't really use it - it serves as my mattress \"topper\" now because I just sleep on top of it. This is an up to you purchase - you can always buy one down the road if you think you need one.\n4. Pillows - I bought two from Walmart, the bedsheet set I linked above comes with pillowcases. I believe since you're an international student you'll be taken to Walmart or Target during orientation itself, but you can always take [Oncall](https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/transportation/brown-university-shuttle/brown-oncall-program) \\- it's basically a free uber for Brown students and I love it so much. Walmart *technically* delivers above $35, but they will try to deliver from a local store if possible which I've had experiences with mail services refusing, since it's not an actual delivery service (like UPS, USPS etc.)\n\nHope that helps!",

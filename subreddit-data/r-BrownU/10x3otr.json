    "postText": "Quick favour (favor?) if there are any Brown swimmers about? I\u2019m visiting Providence from the UK over the weekend and hoping to swim at the Katherine Moran Coleman aquatics centre. I\u2019ve seen the timetable but I\u2019m unsure when it\u2019s set up for long course or short course.\n\nI would email them to check but can\u2019t find an email address. There\u2019s a local phone number but I can\u2019t dial international.\n\nThank you!",

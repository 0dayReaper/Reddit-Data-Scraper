There should be some events organized as part of orientation that you'll also need to go to, however maybe not on the arrival day. There will be tons of people around in matching shirts to whom you can ask any questions. You're right, parking isn't great, especially since they normally limit the dropoff areas to specific streets such as Bowen, where there isn't much space.",

            "comment": "If you\u2019re moving into North Campus, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re going either into Andrews, Miller, Metcalf, Emwool, Champlain, or New Pembroke. I think the key pickup for all of these places is Smith-Bunano Hall. In that case, your first step will be to find it. I\u2019d suggest using Google maps to find it cause Smith-Bunano Hall is technically on Cushing St, but in reality it\u2019s in a tiny parking off of Brown St that\u2019s for some reason considered an extension of Cushing. City planning, am I right?\n\nYou\u2019ll see a desk manned by two upper level students. You need to present them with some information for them to give you your stuff (I think it might be just name and room number, but Brown should have-or will-send you detailed instructions on what you need). They will present you an envelope that has your room key and student Id - as a side note, I would suggest keeping the envelope for when you return your key at the end of the year, though this isn\u2019t necessary. \n\nYou\u2019re right in saying that North Campus doesn\u2019t have a ton of parking. However, you should be fine. \n\nIf you\u2019re moving into Andrews, I would suggest parking in Bowen St: Andrews has a ground level back entrance on Bowen Street that enters the building near the elevator. If you try going in Andrews the front way, you\u2019re going to have a bad time; the front entrances of Andrews are up two flights of stairs. So I would definitely recommend the Bowen Street entrance.\n\nIf you\u2019re going into Champlin or New Pembroke, there\u2019s a decent sized parking lot accessible through Thayer Street (the entrance is right after Blue State Cafe). \n\nIf you\u2019re in Miller and Metcalf, you\u2019ll want to just stay in the same Smith-Bunano parking lot that you picked your key up in. Fortunately, Miller and Metcalf have ramps that bypass their front stairs, so getting in will be easy. \n\nI would also suggest researching if your dorm has an elevator. Some of them do, some don\u2019t. You should be able to use your Brown credentials to access building floor plans to check. Trust me, knowing if there\u2019s an elevator and where it is is essential if you weren\u2019t luck enough to be on the first floor.\n\nAs for the actual process of moving stuff in, the process isn\u2019t too hard. Brown provides these large rolly-bins that allow you to transport a bunch of stuff at once. Just make sure you know where your room is in the building; you don\u2019t wanna be that person who\u2019s wandering around the building with all your stuff in your hands because you thought your room was in this side of the building but it\u2019s actually on that side. \n\nAfter that\u2026well, the hard part is over! All you have left is to set up your room, meet your roommate, and then all the mandatory first year stuff!\n\nAs my final note, I\u2019ll just say that you shouldn\u2019t be afraid to ask upper level students questions when we get back on campus. Brown is known for its very welcoming environment, and a lot of upper level students will be more than enthusiastic to help you out. Heck, the first day of my Sophomore year I saw a junior invite two first years to sit and eat with him at VDub. He had no idea who they were, but he invited them over and answered a bunch of questions. So don\u2019t be afraid to ask!\n\nFeel free to PM me if you have any other questions about move in, living on north campus, or just the first year experience in general",

                    "comment": "Ahhh, two important things I forgot. First is that Brown  has a tendency to change traffic patterns on move in day. If memory serves correctly, some streets are made one way, so drive carefully. Second, I\u2019d coordinate move in times with your roommate. I think Brown staggers move in times, but if your roommate chooses the time slot right after you it won\u2019t really matter that it makes staggered cause you\u2019ll probably still be moving stuff in. Trust me, two people trying to move in at the same time is chaos. I\u2019d say coordinate so one person moves in, then the other comes an hour or more later. This is one of those things that seems obvious but so many people forget",

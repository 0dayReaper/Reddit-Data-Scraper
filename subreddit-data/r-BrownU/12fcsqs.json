    "postText": "We made a site for **housing lottery resources**!\n\nVisit for a **filterable spreadsheet** of all the beds available in the housing lottery, as well as a brand new **review aggregator** platform for dorms, with the intent to allow students to easily share information and photos of each residence hall. The spreadsheet should be particularly useful in the short term with the housing lottery coming up next week, but the review aggregator will hopefully grow to become a more useful tool as more people submit their own photos and reviews. Let me know if you have any questions/suggestions/issues with either the spreadsheet or the review site.\n\n[**https://www.hibearnation.net**](https://www.hibearnation.net)",

If you can manage to make it to campus and find somewhere to stay, I'd recommend you doing it. If not, you'll also be fine. Congrats on becoming a Brown Bear!!",

However, I do know that ADOCH is mainly done to convince students that are still not sure about Brown to come to Brown. Since you're ED and it's basically a fact that you'll be joining the school, the university doesn't see a point in making an impression to y'all. It's not that they're rude, they just want to convince the most people they can",

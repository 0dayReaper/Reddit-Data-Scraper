I plan on joining the HOSA club at school, but hats about it. Please share recommendations for ECs that have helped you, I\u2019m very lost in terms of what else to do. Thank you!",

There definitely is no formula other than to do activities that demonstrate passion and zest. But I also get just wanting to hear from others :) I got into Brown as a BME major this past admission cycle and my top ECs were various research projects, environmental club president, an annual stem camp in Tokyo, and varsity volleyball.

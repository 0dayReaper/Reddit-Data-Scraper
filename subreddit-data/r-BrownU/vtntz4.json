            "comment": "Hello! I was part of the NS-Catalyst program when it was fully remote. For the first couple weeks, I remember focusing a lot on study skills and strategies. Towards the end of the program, we talked about inequities in STEM, and our \"final project\" was a presentation on addressing some of those challenges. For me, the main benefit of the program was meeting new people -- I stayed in touch with some of them when we got on campus.\n\nThis summer, they re-added the in-person component, and I hear they're in the middle of revamping the program, so my experience might not be representative. If you haven't already, you may want to try emailing Christina Smith, the coordinator (I think the email is on the application form).\n\nWelcome to Brown!!",

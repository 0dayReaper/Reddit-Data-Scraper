    "postText": "so i\u2019m a rising first year, and i was just assigned a single in the james mead basement. i was really excited to get a roomate, so i guess i\u2019m interested in hearing what extroverted people\u2019s experiences in singles were. but more so, i\u2019m bummed that i\u2019m in the basement and worried that i\u2019ll have little natural lighting and a not so appealing view of bushes. can anyone attest to a positive experience in either a single or in a basement room? thanks so much",

You\u2019d just be pushed to be outside of your room a bit more",

But you definitely have to be frugal to live. No impulsive splurge and you have to plan your savings if you want to have vacation. Making daily budget helps too.",

Also a bicycle will do the trick for getting to/from campus.\n\nOcean State job lot is good for one time stock ups. Figure out the RIPTA bus routes to the Walmart over the border in Seekonk MA.",

And serious food budgeting, trader joes is decently affordable but something like a Costco would be good but you'd serisouly have to have a planned life to afford it. Providence is very expensive compared to other cities. You also probably couldn't eat out very much because food is so expensive. And 1500 a month doesn't leave you any room for emergency funds really. Overall, I think living on 1500 a month in providence would be extremely difficult.",

That being said, if you could find shared housing for less than 1000 with amenities included, you may be able to make it work. I still wouldn't call it comfortable though, but that 300 would make a large difference.",

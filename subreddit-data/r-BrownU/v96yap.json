    "postText": "Hi, I have two questions.\n\n\n1.     There is an option in the questionnaire that asks about our \"gender inclusive matching preference\". What's your thoughts on the options? Based on your experience, is it better off to choose \"match me with same legal sex as me\" or \" I would be fine with a roommate that has a different legal sex\"?\n\nI'm afraid that choosing the \"same legal sex matching\" option would mean that I would be put in a building exclusively for males.\n\n2.    I am leaning towards choosing the \"quiet\" housing option. What's your thoughts about that option? I don't think I will partying that often, so is the \"quiet\" housing the best choice for me? I personally prioritize hygiene, so is the \"quiet\" option a good choice for that regards? \n\nI know it's all relative and based on personal preferences, but I would appreciate any thought or advice.",

If you're concerned about your own or Brown's footprint, look at lowering the impacts of the two biggest contributors - transportation and energy. Even in the dietary realm, the biggest environmental impact (by far) comes from the consumption of red meats. Absolutely bring a reusable water bottle to the dining halls if you can, but make sure you address the bigger points of your carbon footprint as well.",

    "postText": "Hello, another recent admit here. I\u2019m just wondering if anyone can shed some light on Brown\u2019s financial aid policies. I received my offer, and I\u2019m just wondering if Brown lowers your financial aid package each year as I\u2019ve heard some other colleges do. In other words, do they lure you in with a great offer, and then gradually lower it over the next three years? With the current offer it will be a financial stretch, if they withdraw any aid I don\u2019t think I could finish the four years (trying to avoid major debt as planning on grad school). Any shared insights/experiences are appreciated. Thanks!",

They will tell you what they told me which is that when they admit a student, they earmark a certain percent toward their 4 years which shouldn't change unless your income increases. However they can tell you in a more detailed and personal way.",

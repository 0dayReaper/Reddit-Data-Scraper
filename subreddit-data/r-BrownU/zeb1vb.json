    "postText": "The Brown Journal of Medical Humanities is a new student-run publication that spotlights the emerging fields of narrative medicine and medical humanities. We are seeking graduate and undergraduate submissions focused on subjects including but not limited to medicine, illness, healing, aging, and pain to highlight in our inaugural issue. We will accept both fiction and nonfiction submissions of all lengths under 3500 words and in a range of writing styles, including narrative, prose, essay, and poetry. We will also accept relevant artwork of all media. We hope to highlight undergraduate pieces, but we also welcome submissions from graduate students as well as anyone, including physicians and patients alike, hoping to voice relevant experiences in the medical encounter. \n\nWhat are the medical humanities? Topics the journal will discuss include: Bioethics, Medical Sociology, Medical Anthropology, Disability Studies, History of Medicine, Politics of Health, Trauma in Literature and Poetry, Health Economics, Public Health, Global Health, and Medical Storytelling. \n\nFor more information about the call for submissions please refer to our website (linked [here](https://sites.brown.edu/bjmh/call-for-submissions/)) or feel free to reach out to us at [bjmh@brown.edu](mailto:bjmh@brown.edu) with any questions.",

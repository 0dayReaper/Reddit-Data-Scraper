    "postText": "One of the biggest fears that every incoming freshman has when coming to Brown, or any other school, is always: \"What if I don't make any friends?\" This is a completely valid concern, of course. College is stressful, and big, and most of the time, you don't know a single person there. But as someone who went from having zero to many friends, I'm here to tell you, that you will eventually find your people.\n\nI didn't actually have that many friends for the first half of freshman fall. The people I hung out with at orientation were the people who lived on my floor. And while I really liked them, and enjoyed the time we spent together, I never really clicked into the group. I got so worried about the fact that everyone I talked to seemed to have some group of friends to hang out with, but I didn't. I felt like the only person who wasn't in a group.\n\nIt took a little bit of time, and some effort, to start slowly building a network of friends around me. I met a girl in one of my classes, and around the middle of the semester, actually mustered up the courage to talk to her. I started getting closer to people on my sports team. I met people through clubs, random activities, or just in chance encounters in a library.\n\nNow, as I go into my junior year, I have many friends that I didn't meet until sophomore spring. Hell, I made some new friends just this week that already feel like close companions. So don't stress about not having a group of people in your first week here; friends will come, and they'll be worth the wait.",

We\u2019re looking to talk to recently-arrived first-years about why they chose Brown, especially if they were admitted RD or off the waitlist. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in talking for this story, please shoot me a DM! You can also email me at wkubz@brown.edu, or DM me on Twitter at @wkubz.\n\nThanks \u2014 and welcome to Brown!",

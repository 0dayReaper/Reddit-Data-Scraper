    "postText": "it's great that this sub is now suddenly active but I thought it could use a little variety from the barrage of new admit questions (tho by all means keep those coming too)\n\nSo basically as a university that is older than the nation it occupies, Brown obviously has an incredibly deep, rich, and dense history that is totally intertwined with the origins and development of Providence, Rhode Island, and the colonial/postcolonial Americas. But beyond the pretty basic info given on a few historical markers and memorials (slavery memorial, University Hall plaque, etc.) I feel like a lot of students and people who work here don't necessarily have access to deeper dives into the history on a more granular level. At the same time, IMO a lot of the uniquely \"eldritch vibes\" of the campus and school come from the sense of place tied to the deep time of the unknowable past (which I personally am very here for as a fan of gothic literature).\n\nAnyway somehow (ok tbh at first as a procrastination method) I have gotten weirdly obsessed with tracking down dusty corners of the 90s internet for sites preserving forgotten historical details about Brown and the campus. A lot of people probably know about [Encyclopedia Brunonia](https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/) (originally compiled by Martha Mitchell who was the  University Archivist for over 50 years, [a true \ud83d\udc78](https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2012/02/brown-s-unofficial-historian-remembered-by-faculty-and-staff)) which is always great for a late night deep internet dive. But another good site for scratching the historybrain itch I found is [https://quahog.org/](https://quahog.org/) (\u201cRhode Island History Exhumed\u201d), they have posted transcripts from \"[The Old Stone Bank History of Rhode Island](https://quahog.org/FactsFolklore/History/OSBHoRI/Index)\"\n\n&gt;Between 1927 and about 1953, Rhode Islanders listened to their own Rhode Island Historian, John Williams Haley, on WJAR radio. The show was sponsored by the Providence Institution for Savings (popularly known as The Old Stone Bank), which also footed the bill for a series of educational advertising pamphlets based on the radio show. A selection of these pamphlets was later published in four volumes (in 1929, 1931, 1939, and 1944) called The Old Stone Bank History of Rhode Island. These books can still be found in local used book stores (most notably Cellar Stories in Providence), antique shops, or on eBay.\n\nI like the read the Old Stone Bank entries to myself in a 1930s radio voice, the ones on Christmas in 1780, the Middle campus, and George Washington's four (!) visits to Rhode Island have some good details e.g.\n\n&gt;GEORGE WASHINGTON visited Rhode Island for the fourth and last time in 1790 when the smallest of the States finally ratified the Constitution. When the General became President of the young Republic which he had brought into being, he decided to make a complete tour of the entire territory comprising the United States. In the autumn of his first presidential year he started this plan by visiting New England between October 15 and November 13, 1789, omitting Rhode Island since she had not fallen in line with all the other states and come into the Union. However, when Washington received word that the last of the thirteen Colonies had joined with the others in May 1790, he acknowledged the ratification as follows: \"Since the Bond of Union is now complete, and we once more consider ourselves as one family, it is much to be hoped that reproaches will cease and prejudices be done away; ...if we mean to support liberty and independence, which it has cost us much blood and treasure to establish, we must drive away the demon of party spirit and local reproach.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Upon adjournment of Congress, August 12, 1790, Washington made immediate arrangements to visit Rhode Island and he left New York City for that destination on Sunday, August 15, going first to Newport by boat. He was accompanied by Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of State, George Clinton, Governor of New York, Theodore Foster, Senator from Rhode Island, Judge Blair of the United States Court, William Smith, Member of Congress from South Carolina, Mr. Gilman, Member of Congress from New Hampshire, and three gentlemen of his official family. This was the only sea voyage ever recorded by Washington except the trip to the Barbados in the fall of 1751, when he accompanied his ill brother Lawrence who sought to regain his health in a warmer climate.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Washington was received with great enthusiasm by the people of Newport where he remained for a day and a night. A huge throng greeted him at the wharf; he received many official salutes, and a long procession marched through the streets in his honor. He took a walk about the town and the day ended with a dinner at the State House which was filled to overflowing with the enthusiastic and admiring populace. On the next day, August 18, the President departed for Providence after he had participated in a program of exercises which included addresses by prominent citizens and by the honored guest himself.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The trip from Newport to Providence must have been a tedious one since the passage required seven hours, but the well-planned reception which awaited him at the head of the bay very likely banished all irritation caused by the lengthy boat ride and the late arrival. Two days previous, the town had made preparations to give Washington an official reception. The leading citizens of the community held a public meeting \"to consider of the most proper measures to show the veneration the Town hath of his Character and the Sentiments of Gratitude the Inhabitants entertain for his rescuing America from the Prospect of Slavery and establishing her liberty upon the broad basis of Justice and Equity under a Constitution the Admiration and envy of the civilized World.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Among other things at this meeting it was voted to have all the windows in the Market House mended to help improve appearances of the business section, and Henry Ward, Dr. Enos Hitchcock, Welcome Arnold, David Howell and Benjamin Bourne were elected on a special committee to prepare an address to be presented to the President. Another committee was appointed to arrange the details of the official reception and all the inhabitants were requested to clean sidewalks and streets adjoining their dwellings and have everything spic and span before noon of the day when Washington was expected to arrive. At a second meeting on the following day the wording of the address prepared by the special committee was approved, and Daniel Stillwell was ordered \"to cause the State House to be handsomely illuminated on Occasion of the Arrival of the President of the United States.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;From the contemporary accounts and private records of these eventful days in the history of Providence it is possible to arrange the various events of the reception program in their proper order. The packet bearing the President and his official party arrived in Providence about four o'clock in the afternoon and as the ship approached the wharf cannon salutes were fired from Federal Hill, and an impressive procession was formed to escort him to his place of lodging. The shouts of the crowds, the ringing of the bells and the boom of the guns carried everyone to a high pitch of enthusiasm as Governor Arthur Fenner stepped aboard the packet and welcomed the President to Providence. Then the procession, with various individuals and organizations lined up according to a previous arrangement, moved through the streets to Mr. Daggett's Tavern on Benefit Street (At present the \"Mansion House\" and formerly the \"Golden Ball Inn\"). Washington, with Governor Fenner on his right and Senator Foster on his left, followed the troops, music, and state and city officials, and behind marched Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, Judge Blair, and other distinguished figures present on the occasion. The program printed for this feature of the celebration is a most interesting document and an original copy is now in the possession of the Rhode Island Historical Society.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;When the President arrived at the door of the tavern he reviewed the entire procession and saluted each unit as it passed. He enjoyed a typical family dinner and prepared for bed quite early. As he was about to depart for his night's rest he was informed that the students on the Hill had prepared a special illumination of the building now known as University Hall, and that they would be highly honored if he would visit the College and view the spectacle. Although it was raining slightly, and contrary to his usual custom of remaining indoors at night, he climbed the hill in company with a few friends and there beheld the college building completely illuminated with candle lights in every window.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The following morning, Thursday, was cold and rainy. However, the weather cleared later and Washington took a walk about the town accompanied by several of his official hosts. This walk lasted until early afternoon and included a climb to the top of University Hall and a tour of a local shipyard where a large ship was on the stocks. Stops for refreshments were made at the John Brown residence (still standing on Power Street), at Governor Fenner's home, and at Deputy Governor Jabez Bowen's. After a brief rest at the tavern he received the addresses of the Society of the Cincinnati, Rhode Island College (now Brown University), and the Town of Providence. Then he went to the Town Hall where a dinner had been prepared in his honor, and to this affair several hundred persons had been invited. An immense throng surrounded the hall on the outside, and when a toast was proposed to \"The President of the United States\" the whole company within and without cheered loudly and indulged in a spirited demonstration of enthusiasm. Washington then rose and drank the health of the company present, and later gave the toast, \"The Town of Providence.\"",

I did some research while I was there on the Brown family and a lot of their papers are in the Hay. Fascinating history there.\n\nIf you're interested in more modern history, there's a podcast called crime town where the first season is on Providence, specifically the mob history.",

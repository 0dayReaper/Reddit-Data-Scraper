    "postText": "I'm doing research here over the summer and I needed to find some housing. One of my friends recommended that I apply to be a residential assistant for the precollege students in order to get free housing and a meal plan. Has anyone done this before? Do you think it's possible to balance the RA position and research at the same time? BTW the lab that I'm doing has no set hours, but I would like to do 30 hours if possible. Thanks!",

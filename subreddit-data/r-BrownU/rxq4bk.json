I\u2019m really into competitive powerlifting and the Nelson didnt necessarily seem powerlifting friendly as they have rules against chalk. Thank you for any help!",

Edge technically doesn\u2019t  allow chalk but I use it openly there and no one has ever given me trouble. It also has slightly nicer equipment than the Nelson. At the Nelson, they are a bit more strict, you can get away with using chalk if you do it discretely, but you also have to be careful about not dropping the weights too hard/slamming them as they are strict about that. Regardless I\u2019ve found success lifting in both places so I wouldn\u2019t worry too much.",

I've been lifting for about 2 and a half years now but the school I am in currently has a very poor gym with no squat rack/ deadlifting platform/ only has dumbbells up to 40lbs. \nI was wondering how you got into powerlifting? Is there something I could join/ someone I could contact to start getting into it and finding coaching?",

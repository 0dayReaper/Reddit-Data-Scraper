            "comment": "When it comes to unis in the top 25 in the US, differences in actual quality of education is pretty marginal. That said, if your main focus is prestige, Stanford is definitely more prestigious. If you wanna work on Silicon Valley, Stanford is definitely the better choice. Brown has the 2nd best professors in the country however, so if your main concern is how well you will be taught, Brown outperforms Stanford in that area. If you wanna work in the American northeast, getting to internship interviews in NYC and Boston from Providence is a lot easier than from Palo Alto (and the same conversely for San Francisco and LA). Other than that, things like if you like the Open curriculum, like colder weather, and if one is cheaper than the other should be considered. As an international, a lot more Europeans will have heard of Stanford, so the name recognition is pretty crazy lol (obviously name recognition in the region you\u2019re leaving shouldn\u2019t be the primary factor, but it\u2019s still cool \ud83d\udc80). \n\nTl;dr: it depends on your own personal priorities. \n\n(And both have crazy grade inflation lmaooo I\u2019m pretty sure Brown has the highest average GPA in the US, and Stanford is immediately after \ud83d\udc80 so that\u2019s important if you\u2019re applying to grad school)",

Your GPA is the main statistic in your academic transcript in college, so if you apply to Law school (for example) your main stats would be GPA and the Law school admission test (LSAT) score.

That is why Brown was my dream school before I applied. However, I am super interested in entrepreneurship (which is what my entire application was about basically) \u2013 a type of culture which is much more prevalent at Stanford (for better or for worse, however).\n\nStanford and Brown are not so different in terms of name recognition where I am from, so \"prestige\" is not the most important reason for choosing a school in my case. \n\nI guess it comes down to this: As an international student, I don't just want my college experience to be a \"blip\" in space and time \u2013\u00a0you come in at 18, leave at 22, and then go back to Europe (or someplace else, but definitely not staying in the US my whole life). I feel like the East Coast may be better in this regard, as there are more students with ties to Europe. Americans may not understand that this is an issue for some int'l students, but it kind of is, mostly for emotional reasons. Stanford just \"feels\" more foreign because it is much farther away.\n\n**\"Personal\" reasons to go to Stanford:**\n\nI am from northern Europe, so the weather is a huge plus. I dream of starting a venture in college or afterward, and Silicon Valley seems like the best place to foster that dream. \n\nI'm also not really qualified to say whether there is a huge difference in name recognition where I want to live in the future (other parts of Europe or elsewhere) so maybe it is more important than I'm making it out to be. \n\nLastly, and perhaps most importantly, I don't actually know whether I would be \"happier\" at Brown just because it is generally considered to be more laid-back.",

Like, a significant proportion of the students start and sell a company in their time there.

But from another post([https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/fp6gpq/cost\\_of\\_ms\\_cs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/fp6gpq/cost_of_ms_cs/)) on this thread, I found out that, a professor mentioned that the cost of attendance is actually 35K$ per year, and the website was actually showing the wrong cost. He also attached a document([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BVR4klDuDBF43LYV5JVETPZIun9MHoR1/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BVR4klDuDBF43LYV5JVETPZIun9MHoR1/view)) showing the tuition fee rolled out by the brown university to be 35K$.  \n\n\nCan someone who is currently a graduate student at Brown in the CS department please confirm or shed some light on this?",

            "comment": "Cost of attendance is an average number they use that factors in tuition, room and board, meal plan, and an estimate of additional expenses (books, clothes, etc.).\nTechnically you only have to pay $35k for tuition, but that\u2019s assuming you live nearby and won\u2019t have to pay room and board, won\u2019t have to pay for their meal plan, etc. also IIRC brown requires you to live in the dorms your first year unless you\u2019re married or have another special exemption.\n\nThe reason they calculate cost of attendance is to give students a reasonable amount of money for financial aid. If you are 100% need based, they will also pay you for housing and meal plan.\n\nIn addition, you can choose to live off campus, cook your own food, and live frugally to keep your personal cost of attendance down, but you will still get financial aid based on the average COA ($67k).\n\nI was 100% need based and I ended up being able to have extra pockets money from their financial aid bc I cooked my own food instead of being on meal plan.\n\nSome students might find they will have a higher COA if they spend a lot of money. However they won\u2019t be able to get any extra aid in addition to the COA.",

If you\u2019re getting 0 aid then you should only have to pay for tuition and feed out of pocket. The rest is just the estimated COA for students who will need financial aid. COA can still have you by giving you an idea of how much you will be paying. Although TBH you can find super cheap apartments off campus that won\u2019t be anywhere near their estimate.",

Some people asked this question in an admitted students event but the master's enrollment team insisted that this is 1 year estimate not 2 years, even though course wise calculation clearly shows it's 2 years. I also talked with a current student and he told me it's 2 years. For some reason, i20 office/Brown's financial office wants proof of 2 years fund instead of 1 year while claiming that they're only asking for 1 year's funds. I wish there was some WhatsApp group or something and we could mail the master's enrollment team jointly, idk, something like that.",

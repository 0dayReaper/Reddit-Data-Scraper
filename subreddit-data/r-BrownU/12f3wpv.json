    "postText": "This is for financial aid reasons. \n\n1. If we marry, we would be considered as independents under fafsa so Brown would use our jointly filed taxes which would be like 0 (since we are broke college students)\n2. since we are in the poverty line as we are considered as \"independents\", we could be eligible for government benefits such as SNAP. \n\nWe'd do a pre-nup so the money we don't have the split the money when we tragically divorce 4 years later.  And then if you want to go to like grad school, you can write a banger essay on the struggles of balancing marriage life and academics or something like that. \n\nIn the state of NY, it only costs \\~35$ to get the marriage certificate and like \\~150$ to get a divorce certificate. So we only spend \\~190$ to save a lot of money in tuition. \n\nPlease pm if interested.",

Just to be clear, you would only be considered an independent student for federal aid, not for university scholarship purposes.",

And subject to division. Also, a court could nullify the prenup. Then what? And if a spouse acquires debt or is injured or becomes disabled, the other spouse is legally responsible.",

    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m sure people have asked this a ton already but I was just wondering if there\u2019s any major differences between sub-free and regular housing and if it\u2019s worth doing for a pre-frosh. Although I don\u2019t really drink or smoke and usually have more fun without it, I also don\u2019t care if other people around me do it and would eventually want to party once in a while. I also don\u2019t wanna be secluded from everyone else socially\u2026 thoughts on what I should do? Thanks!",

            "comment": "So I was in sub free for two years. There\u2019s this huge myth that if you\u2019re sub free you\u2019ll have trouble socially\u2026. that\u2019s not true. Pretty much no one cares if you\u2019re sub free unless you\u2019re one of those people who\u2019s obnoxious about it. You won\u2019t have trouble at all. \n\nRealistically, there\u2019s not a massive difference between sub-free and regular housing. The only big difference is that in sub-free the hallways typically won\u2019t smell like weed and you probably won\u2019t get a bunch of drunk people in the hallway on weekends. I do also want to note that not everyone in sub-free is actually sub-free.\n\nIn other words, if you do sub-free you\u2019re not going to miss out on anything, and if you do regular housing it\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to be living in Animal House.\n\nFeel free to pm me if you have any more questions. I\u2019m a rising senior so I know quite a bit about the university",

I also know multiple sub free kids who use substances anyway, so I would recommend going normal to have better social connections with non sub free kids",

Substance free housing is usually for people in recovery which we\u2019re not. I think it\u2019s important to leave it for those who really need it!",

I felt people definitely became friends, hanged out, and had fun without the drunken environment. I would say don't do it if your the type that would regret \"missing out\", but i definitely appreciated my experience in comparison to what my colleagues in other dorms had. \n\nAlso, you can have the best of both worlds by going out partying at other dorms/frats/groups/teams/etc. I found it great to have the wild party environment be external and something to go to rather than something to live with.",

Many people on my sub-free floor still went out and partied, but the partying always happened somewhere else, which I really appreciated. You\u2019ll find fun and extroverted people in either housing option, so it\u2019s really just whatever you feel comfortable with!",

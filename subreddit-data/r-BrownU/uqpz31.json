            "comment": "I took it last Fall and would highly recommend for CS concentrators. It doesn't teach a new skill that you could list on paper in my opinion (unless you're going into the field of PL), by this I mean that unlike classes such as UI/UX or CS33, you can't summarize in 1 word what you learned (\"I learned frontend\" / \"I learned C/C++ and Systems\") -- However, what it does give you is a much deeper understanding of why things work the way they do, which can really help with making your code neater, less error-prone, and helps in understanding the weird edge-cases that might come up in programming.\n\nOverall, personally CS173 was a like an overall booster to my programming style and robustness, but didn't teach me any *new* skills for fields outside PL.",

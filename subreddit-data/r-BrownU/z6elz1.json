Throws decent parties occasionally. Kind of thought of as a PG-13 frat. Gives out a lot of bids. \n\nDPhi - On campus but doesn\u2019t have a house. Mostly rich dudes. Lots of hard drugs. Doesn\u2019t throw many open parties. Longer rush process and selective with bids. \n\nPhi Psi/Lantern - Kicked off campus a while back. Extremely secretive but supposedly have a very tight knit brotherhood and throw good parties. Hard to find details without knowing a brother. \n\nSigma - Kicked off campus a while back. Considered the most fratty frat. A lot of the lacrosse team is in it. Been declining in recent years. \n\nRush is technically in the spring but dirty rush will probably start soonish.",

            "comment": "There are a number of things wrong/missing from this post. I'll try to fill in the gaps.\n\nSome general notes about Frat/Party culture at Brown:\n\n* Brown does not have \"Frat Houses\" with letters on the front. The members of different orgs will often rent a house and use it to throw parties, but these houses often change hands year-to-year, and there may be multiple locations attributable to the same frat. So one year an address might be \"a DPhi House,\" and the next be \"the Sigma House\" depending on whose renting. The same frat may also run multiple houses/apartments.\n* Often frats will rent out bars/clubs these days and invite people to there; often people have to buy tickets to come.\n* DPhi, International House, and Lantern/Phi Psi seem to be the most socially present frats on campus right now. Sigma was previously as well but is on the downturn.\n* There's something of a division between the social scene between athletes and non-athletes; neither is seen as better but they kind of run in parallel to eacho ther.\n\nSome comments on Thete, Buxton/International House, or Zeta\n\nThete: Football frat, seems pretty classically \"fratty,\" I don't know much about their rush. They have little-to-no social presence on campus, at least among non-athletes\n\nBuxton/International House: As the name suggests, it is about 70% international. It is also co-ed and arguably the most exclusive society of the bunch. Very rich scene, plenty of drugs, but plenty of cool people. Also has the hardest parties to get into, even if you know someone in the org\n\nZeta: LGBT+ frat, open to all gender identities. I don't know very much about them, maybe someone else can give more info.\n\nA few other notes:\n\n* Most frats seem relatively closed off to freshmen. DTau is the only one I've heard of letting freshmen into their parties en masse and seems much more socially present among freshmen than the other frats.\n* Sigma is definitely on the downturn, they are probably going to need another couple years before they rebuild\n* DPhi is the Lacrosse frat, not Sigma. They don't have a main off campus house this year and have been throwing smaller parties\n* Lantern/Phi Psi only rushes by word of mouth but is culturally more down-to-earth than DPhi or International House. It's more a matter of where you fit in best between the three\n* If I were an underclassman interested in rushing I'd probably rush either DPhi, Int. House, or Lantern, depending on which best fits your vibe. If Zeta is for you I'd pursue that too, but idk anything about them.\n* You also can join International House and a \"real frat\" at the same time, but I don't think you can join two Greek orgs at the same time\n\nI'll try to update this if I have any more that I think about. Also feel free to reply if you have any questions about frats, their respective cultures, or the party scene at Brown more broadly.",

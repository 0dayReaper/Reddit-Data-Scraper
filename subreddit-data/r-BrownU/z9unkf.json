Yesterday I\u2019ve read that certain people got a personal request to submit their grades. \nDoes Brown always request grades even if my record has always been flawless and the rigor was maintained high? I haven\u2019t been requested to submit anything, does it mean that they haven\u2019t gotten to my application yet or I\u2019m just rejected?",

And I spend Like 10 hours going through Quora, CC, Reddit and most people who got them requested ended up getting in. So If Brown was to ask for Quarter grades, take it with pride. Though it is still possible to get deferred and rarely rejected.   \n\u2018Edit: I had 1 B in AP calc junior year and flawless Grades the rest. Some people also didn\u2019t get them requested and still got in.",

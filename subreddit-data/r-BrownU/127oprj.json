As a first-year, you don\u2019t have any real control over the assignment.\n\nEdit: there are some options for quiet housing, substance free housing, and there is an option for having a gender inclusive roommate. I am not as familiar with these options, but someone else could probably elaborate.",

The major options are North campus and Keeney. \n\nKeeney isn\u2019t too bad facilities wise, but it\u2019s typically a party dorm and the walls are basically stained with the scent of weed. Some higher power apparently hates it too. That dorm has flooded multiple times and been struck by lightening.\n\nNorth Campus is decent. Emwool and Mochamp benefit from being connected to a dining hall, V-Dub, the only dining hall where you can consistently get food poisoning. The rooms there are pretty decent and have semi-private bathrooms.\n\nMiller and Metcalf are twin dorms that are pretty decent considering they\u2019ve been updated recently. Also a hop, skip, and a jump from Andrews Commons, a great dining hall.\n\nAndrews is probably one of the best dorms on campus. Large rooms, massive lounges, and an elevator that goes directly into the dining hall. Private sinks in your room too. Too bad they do a lot of forced triples in there",

Unless u care about sub free, quiet, gender inclusive etc but they don\u2019t guarantee you a dorm, just that people on your hall will also be part of that community",

As for triples in Andrews, the dorms are usually made to be doubles so its just a much smaller space and dealing with 2 roommates.\n\nI guess nothing to worry about now but yeah there isn't much you can do. I'm class of 2026 btw so I live there currently",

    "postText": "hi, im an incoming freshman this fall and planning to concentrate in bme/at least something stem on the premed track. im also heavily involved in music and i wanted to possibly join the chamber music program, but i found out that it counts as a course. would my course load be ok if i chose to take four regular courses and then an extra course for chamber music to make it 5 total courses? wouldnt it be more like a club than a class since its s/nc anyway?",

I never understood nonhumanities students who claimed that they didn\u2019t have heavy workloads. Or rather, I always saw those kids as being unnecessarily arrogant through lying. Understand your required courses and make smart decisions. You have 4 years. Take a moment to situate yourself.",

I don't really think of the music credits as a course -- I think of it more as an activity/club. But I'm not gonna be super STEM intense so up to you!",

I think they usually open at 8 a.m. Res-life will communicate when and where to pick up your key and what to do if you arrive later in the day. Otherwise, when you arrive, it's up to you. Parents will usually stay and help unpack/organize. There will be different orientation events you can go to, so if you arrive earlier and unpack, then that opens up time to do other things. I know some parents stick around for a few days, but for the majority of families, I've seen parents just stick around for move in day.",

The Ratty is very close to both, so if you want something to eat, thats not too far either.",

Some questions to keep in mind when creating your schedule are if you can sit and listen for long periods of time, when you want breaks, where are your courses located, etc. So, account for your learning style and types of courses and make sure you aren't burning yourself out. Also, you'll talk to your advisor later on during orientation week to choose your courses. Your meik will be there to help you out, too, since they've had experience with different schedules and can give you some pointers on it. \n\nAs for courses listed under your concentration, some are offered during the fall, while others are offered during the spring (or both!). There are a handful of courses that are offered from time to time, but don't necessarily have a pattern because it's up to the prof if they want to offer it or not. The fall lineup should be set-- maybe with the exception of the freshman seminars. If you're interested in those, Brown will release them on a list (if they haven't already) for you to check out and rank from first choice to third choice; freshman seminar enrollment is lottery-style, but you'll have a chance to shop and sign up for them when classes start.",

They accept around 20 peeps from the incoming class each year and provide a stipend for every semester. Let me know if you have any questions about the program; I'd be happy to answer as a Bonner! I also did TWTP and New Scientist-Catalyst during orientation week. :)",

It\u2019s definitely a program I\u2019m super interested in but I was wondering if it\u2019s worth applying to for a non fgli. Is it hard to get into the other programs you mentioned? Sorry abt the loads of questions haha",

I thought that those were the common themes when writing my BCF supplements. While there are lots of amazing FGLI students within the fellowship, it certainly isn't limited to one identity; definitely apply if you're into community engagement and getting to know Brown's relation to the city (e.g. community partners, social impact, etc). \n\nFor other preorientation programs, their applications were pretty chill. Everyone I knew who was interested in it eventually participated in it, so don't stress about it. As long as you give genuine responses, you're set. Feel free to ask any more questions, though. I love answering them!!!",

I think they've upped their budget, so you're able to get a pretty decent laptop for cheap (if you qualify). Most folks just have to pay the taxes-- even if their secured funding can technically cover it. Definitely check that resource out before investing in a laptop fully out-of-pocket!",

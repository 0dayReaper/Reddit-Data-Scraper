There were many cheaper ones, but be careful of landlords taking advantage of students by offering bad quality housing.",

I was originally giving a more complete answer, albeit in a tongue-in-cheek pedantic way, in case the OP really wanted to not live on campus (edit: like a \"fun fact!\" sort of thing). It is up to the OP what they want to do with that information.\n\nI went to Brown for graduate school, and went to Columbia and another university for undergrad. The combined cost of a Brown dorm and an off-campus apartment is (or was, a few years ago) less than $3000, which is entirely reasonable for a good one bedroom apartment in the Upper West Side of New York. Perhaps that is why I do not find this ludicrous.\n\n\nI did not go to Brown for undergrad, but I was friends with most of the Chinese international students at my other undergrad east coast liberal arts college. I am not a billionaire, but I am a millionaire, and I considered doing this during my freshman year due to the noisy dormitories. Unfortunately, there were no good apartments nearby. Some of my wealthier friends would have had no problem doing such a thing, but they seemed to like the dormitories.",

            "comment": "hi! i\u2019ve taken cs111, and i absolutely loved it! i took it last fall, and it was a pretty low-stress course for the most part, but i still learned SO much. i was a freshman last year, so it was my only class in the fall\u2014 i think i spent around 7 hours per week. heads up, the first assignment isn\u2019t a great representation of the difficulty of the assignments, since i remember knocking it out in around 2 hours or so. it was still a valuable and enjoyable assignment, especially for someone who has no coding experience. there are also weekly lab sessions (although i believe cs15 has lab as well) which take 2 hours, unless you finish early. kathi is teaching it this semester, and she\u2019s a fantastic and caring professor. i also wouldn\u2019t worry about not being good at math, i don\u2019t recall any math being involved aside from the occasional addition/subtraction/multiplication. \n\ni don\u2019t know too much about cs15, but 15 will definitely take up more of your time. depending on exactly why 15 works better with your schedule, maybe this would be a better option\u2014 it ultimately comes down to weighing the advantages of 15 and the less stressful atmosphere of 111. from what i\u2019ve heard, there\u2019s a lot less collaboration in 15 (it\u2019s a pretty strict policy). if that\u2019s also a concern, 111 might be the way to go. \n\nfeel free to pm if you have any other questions :)",

            "comment": "(Disclaimer: I haven't taken either of these courses but I have spoken to many people who have, as well as professors in the department who are affiliated with these courses)\n\nCS 111 is the newest intro course in the CS department, and from what I hear, it provides a really fresh perspective on computing and is a very well-designed, well-*taught* course. It's meant to be a calmer course that's really friendly towards people with no CS experience, and the professor who teaches it is also *absolutely fantastic.*\n\nA bonus about 111: you can either take it with a steady workload and then take 0112 (the second course in the 3 part intro sequence), or you can do some accelerating material at the end of the course to condense your intro sequence into 2 semesters. But you have tons of time to make that decision, based on how you're feeling about the material and the pace!\n\nLooking at the Critical Review, it seems like CS 15 has about twice the weekly workload of 111. My friends who took 15 said that the workload of 15 especially ramps up towards the end, though I'm not sure about 111. I'd definitely recommend 111, but you should make your own decision based on what you feel is best for *you*! Good luck :)",

If I were you I\u2019d call and ask to confirm that the pass will allow you to go from Boston to Providence. I had to commute a lot to Boston this summer, and I used the Monthly Commuter Rail Pass, which would be like $378 to go from Providence to Boston. You get unlimited rides for the month on the commuter rail and the subway with that\n\nEdit: Btw for the Monthly Pass, don\u2019t buy that on the app, as the digital version doesn\u2019t work for the subway. You\u2019ll need to buy a ticket into South Station and buy it in person there",

The link pass only says it offers commuter rail zone 1a, which makes me think it would let you depart from south station, but I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019d be able to use it to depart from Providence, since Providence is in zone 8 iirc.",

The train stalled and we were stuck for 4 hours before a bunch of folks (me included) pried the doors and walked through the woods near the track to the closest populated area. Luckily only a mile and a half. I had a friend pick me up at a sports bar after a few stiff shots.\n\nThat was a mild snow.\n\nLack of infrastructure maintenance does that. Most days the train was only an hour late.",

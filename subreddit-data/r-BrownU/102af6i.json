Does anyone know what my chances could look like? I\u2019m trying to keep the faith but I\u2019m definitely feeling doubtful. TIA!",

To be honest, I didn't really do anything groundbreaking in between ED and RD, I just improved my GPA with my first semester grades and got better positions in my extracurriculars. I also stopped thinking about Brown and focused on my other applications. Ultimately this was helpful as I got financial aid at one of the other schools that let me appeal my package from Brown.",

Don't lose hope but also make sure you have a backup plan in place. In the end you will end up where you are meant to be.  Best of luck!",

All the others communicated some sort of achievement like receiving all A's on his semester grades, winning the lacrosse championship, getting promoted in JROTC, things like that.",

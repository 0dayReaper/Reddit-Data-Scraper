Also I was wondering does brown take transfers with 2.5 years of school? I\u2019d love to talk to anyone about their experience!",

Your social circle would be comprised of mostly transfers.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to do at least two years at Brown, so they might not cash in all your credits. Summer courses usually don\u2019t count for anything.\n\nAlso, this school is awesome!",

    "postText": "So I'm currently a freshman at UC Berkeley right now but for many years my dream school has always been Brown. I was devastated when I got rejected for the regular decision last school year, but I'm thinking of possibly transferring to Brown for the 2023-24 school year and afterward to complete my degree. \n\nI have some questions about financial aid and transfer requirements. I know that Brown requires 28 credits to have already been completed when applying - if I'm able to get into all the courses I want for my spring semester, I will have over 28 credits \"planned\" to complete. So does this mean that I can apply as a transfer, or do I actually have to finish the spring semester (my fall semester right now is 14 total credits) in order to apply? \n\nAlso, how generous is the financial aid for transfer students? I'm really worried about affording the cost because I was able to receive quite a generous financial aid for my first year here at Berkeley, but since Brown's total cost of attendance (without aid) is already higher than Berkeley's, I don't know if I should even consider applying as a transfer when it wouldn't be financially possible for me at all in the first place. \n\nIf anyone could give me these answers and any other helpful information, I would really appreciate it!",

No one knows how much financial aid they give transfers bc none of the \u201ctraditional\u201d transfers who got admitted during my year applied for financial aid. They\u2019re trying to become a little more generous, so they might start admitting people who apply for FA. If you get admitted after applying for FA, they\u2019re quite generous based on your need.",

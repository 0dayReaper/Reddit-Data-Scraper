Is this really the case? should I contact someone else? I just wanted to see exactly where I went right and wrong to help get a better understanding so I can help my younger siblings get into a good college in the future.",

There's nobody else to contact, it's only the registrar. I will say, nothing in mine was advice that I could've really given to anyone else, so I don't know that it would be that useful for you to use as data for your younger siblings.",

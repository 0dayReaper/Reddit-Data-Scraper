I\u2019m in Minden in a triple and we have two full bathrooms in our room in addition to the floor restroom.\n\nIt would make headlines if Brown did not offer this level of privacy given today\u2019s culture around that all. Indeed, they even had to do away with communal showers (w/o curtains or barriers) at my hs but got away with cinderblock separators, no curtain. That would not fly at any university, especially one with non-gendered restrooms",

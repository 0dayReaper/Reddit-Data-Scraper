    "postText": "I want to choose Brown for my ED, and got questions about its concentration. In Brown's website it said students can develop independent concentration, but I don't know how it works. I want to study both astronomy and history in college, does IC enable me to do so? Genuine thanks for any advice!",

            "comment": "If you apply for an IC with an explanation of a topic connecting the two concentrations then you definitely can apply classes in both concentrations to the IC. When you apply for an IC you include the classes that you would take for it, so as long as you make an argument for a class connecting to the IC it can be a part of it.\n\nYou could also concentrate in both or concentrate in one and use the flexibility of the open curriculum to take a lot of classes in the other.",

I mean, will double concentration students learn less deeper knowledge than those who take one? Or the course depth will be the same so double concentration takes more time?",

They may ask why you aren't just dual concentrating, so I'd really tie the IC together well as wanting to explore the history of astronomy (or whatever the connection is), to sell the IC.",

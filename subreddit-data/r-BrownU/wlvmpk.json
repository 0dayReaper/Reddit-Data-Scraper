I didn't even know back then that those would become the \"good old days\".\n\nI thought it was pretty good, but there are a few shortcomings. I think Everett is the one part of Keeny that has no elevator, so be ready to haul your stuff up the stairs. The Kitchen is on the 5th floor, so if you wanna heat up some food or something, it could be a bit of a troop. Oh yeah also, the kitchen is shared with everyone in everett. And I'm pretty sure you're gonna have to share the bathroom with your floor (pro-strat: Use the batroom at 2am (haha jokes... but I really did this)). I think one of my walls we're cinder block. That didn't bother me. I had a tv so I was usually looking at a screen and not the wall.\n\nI liked it. I don't know if that's helpful at all. If there's any specific question you wanna ask, I'll answer it.",

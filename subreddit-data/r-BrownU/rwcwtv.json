    "postText": "I just applied to Brown, really liking the open curriculum. However, in terms of community fit, would I be an outlier as a Midwestern dude who fishes a lot? (I do other outdoors stuff like hiking, climbing, etc. fishing is just the main one).                                               \n\nLike, I don\u2019t need the school to be dominated by outdoorsy types. But, is there some chunk of outdoorsy people at Brown? Of course, I have hobbies besides nature stuff, but I\u2019m concerned I may not be the best fit for brown if some of my major hobbies aren\u2019t very common at the school.",

There's not a lot of us from the middle of the country 0: I felt out of place at first, but it's cool getting to meet people from everywhere and you can definitely still find people you connect with!! :D",

Like someone else in this thread said, not many people from a rural state who get out and fish lol but You\u2019ll definitely find people with similar hobbies. I haven\u2019t done any fishing at school, but I know there is good fishing around. Feel free to PM!",

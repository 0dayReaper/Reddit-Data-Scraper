How did he get an offer to play ball when Ivy league schools don\u2019t offer scholarships? I\u2019ve also seen this with Dartmouth and Yale",

One thing these kids do a lot on here is like let\u2019s say a coach says something like \u201cwe\u2019d be happy to have you with our program\u201d or something like that. They\u2019ll jump to conclusions and make a post like this. Now some are legitimate scholarships of course. But often times you\u2019ll see a kid with like 20+ offers from all over and I doubt those were ALL real. I posted this because I was curious if Ivy League schools have some sort of loophole like DIII schools. But I guess not",

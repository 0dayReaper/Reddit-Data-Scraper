    "postText": "I know this page is mostly high schoolers looking for admissions advice, but to any Brown students considering doing a 5th year masters, absolutely DO NOT DO IT. Please heed my warning. It is a colossal waste of time and money. Departments only care about undergraduates and PhD students. One year isn\u2019t nearly enough time to specialize at all or do any research. Professors couldn\u2019t care less about helping you because you\u2019re not around long enough for them to put effort into you. They just take your money then forget about you. Doing absolutely anything else would be a better use of your time. I wish I could drop out right now, but I wouldn\u2019t get any money back so I might as well finish. Please don\u2019t make the same mistake I did. If anyone wants more information please feel free to DM me",

Two semesters isn't a ton of time, but its in the PIs best interest to make use of the extra pair of hands.   Even better if you do a Master's in a lab where you've been working for a couple years as it can be a continuation of your already existing project.",

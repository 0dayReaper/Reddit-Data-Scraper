    "postText": "So parent of a sophomore here. \n\nWe have a pretty good relationship and always have so trying to navigate parenting an adult in a respectful manner. \n\nBut I am super worried about him right now as he isn\u2019t going to class, he is turning in assignments late, and I really think he is in danger of losing his place in the program he has been accepted to at Brown. He is a sophomore and really struggled his first semester so got connected with help both in and outside of school, though I don\u2019t see him utilizing it. He has friends, isn\u2019t partying, but just isn\u2019t doing his work :( \n\nAnyone here struggle? What help from your parents, if any, did you want/need/find helpful?",

He possibly needs help and Brown will understand. Just keep them in the loop if he needs a break. They can even switch his classes to P/F if needed. He is more than his academic success and if he cannot talk to you find a professional (even online) for him to meet with while home. Since he\u2019s an adult there\u2019s not much else you can do beyond letting him know you are supportive of him and will continue to love him unconditionally.",

            "comment": "He should take a semester off immediately at the end of this one and go work or travel. Being at Brown with no sense of direction or focus is a huge waste. Plus if he takes the time now he won't have feelings of shame or depression attached to it.  He can go do one of those sail around the world programs or something. Needs to be around people, get connection, find himself, etc. \nFeeling depressed and disconnected doesn't just get better on its own.  A semester abroad is a great move for this, but it doesn't need to be through Brown, and will be substantially cheaper if it isn't. \n\nAnd if he does take the time off, he must not, cannot, stay with you in the comfort of home. Whatever he does, it has to be uncomfortable and new, as the whole point is push him outside of his comfort zone and to manifest the strength that comes with being self-determined.",

    "postText": "Is anyone else super fucking lonely? I don't know how people you talk to at parties or in class ever just become a friend. How do you go from talking to someone to exchanging information if you're not hitting on them?? Anyway, I've met some cool weird people on this subreddit before and me + my best friend are hoping to do that again. I like meeting people online because I don't like to seem desperate for human connection IRL, but I don't want to post on Dear Blueno with my whole government name. Bonus points if you like A24 movies, 6ish person gatherings, coffee, or have memes to actively share with us. If it matters, we live in south campus and do our studying at the SciLi. DM me for human connection &amp; happy midterm season all &lt;3",

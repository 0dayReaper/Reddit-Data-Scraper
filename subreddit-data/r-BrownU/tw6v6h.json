    "postText": "Hello Brown reddit community, I am a faculty member at Brown as is my partner. We are looking to hire one or more students to look after our 1-year old dog on a quasi-regular basis -- usually it would be just for a hour or two at a time but could be up to a few days when we need to travel for research and conferences. Will pay a good hourly rate and also provide access to our loft apartment on the West Side of Providence.\n\nIn the past we would have put a classified ad in the Brown Daily Herald but I don't think that even exists anymore and I'm not sure students check it! Where do students look for side gigs? Is there a facebook group or other site that you all check? Or is Reddit the best bet?",

    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI'm a rising first year and I wanted to know if Brown offers some music lessons (specifically piano or guitar) for regular students (not just those taking music classes/those in a choir or band). If so, are they free/ economically accessible for a college student?\n\nOr,,, if Brown does not offer music lessons, are there some in Providence that I can check out?",

I think it\u2019s mainly geared towards advanced/intermediate musicians, and I\u2019d prefer something more at a beginner level. Do you have any other suggestions?",

            "comment": "Ah yes I had the same issue. I really wanted to play piano, but had 0 experience during my freshman year. I bought a keyboard and practiced on my own for about a year very inconsistently. I mostly tried to play songs from Final Fantasy 13 and did Hanon exercises. This Summer though, I found a piano teacher on Fiverr and she will give me an hour session for $15. From 2 or 3 one hour sessions with this teacher, I probably learned more than I did during the year on my own. This is greaf for me because I've heard some piano teachers be really expensive and while I do want to become a better player, I would like to not break the bank in the process.\n\nSo, I recommend getting a keyboard (at least 49 keys?) and practicing on your own to get your hands familiar with your instrument. Then after a while, if you're up for it, you can probably find someone to teach you for cheap on a site like Fiverr. I would be careful with Fiverr though. It's very possible you hire a teacher that's not very good, but I think I got lucky.",

I'm an international student who will join Brown next year, and I was wondering whether it's possible to choose a roommate rather than have one assigned randomly according to the questionnaire. I saw someone on the WashU subreddit share a roommate-seeking spreadsheet (to find some friends before arriving at campus), and I thought it would be cool to have a similar thing for Brown :))",

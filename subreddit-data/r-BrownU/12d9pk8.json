    "postText": "Hey everyone! I am thrilled to be a recent admit to Brown planning on studying Economics and possibly going into finance or consulting post college. I am wondering how strong the Alumni network is at Brown? Is it easy to connect with alumni to get advice and internships? Does the network feel tight-knit or somewhat disconnected? Any thoughts, input, and experiences would be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Alum here. The network is really good, yes. Since Brown enrolls mostly students with an independent mindset and approach, you won\u2019t find the monolithic \u201crah rah\u201d culture of a USC or Notre Dame. But alumni love hearing from other Brunonians and will respond to outreach if they are not flat out too busy. \n\nThe alumni networking tools (online directory and BrownConnect) are fine. LinkedIn is often better. Better yet is walking into the alumni office and making an appointment to talk with alumni staff. They know a lot of alums and have access to data etc. CareerLab also. Take the initiative! \n\nUltimately it\u2019s more up to the student or the individual alum to make the network useful, but that\u2019s always true - not unique to Brown. If you reach out to alums you should 1) state a fairly clear reason or goal for making the outreach and 2) always reply or follow up. As an alum, the biggest issues I have with students and other alums contacting me are \n- no clear outcome in mind before messaging me, and \n- ghosting me after I say \u201csure, let\u2019s meet for coffee\u201d or \u201cgive me some days that would work for a call.\u201d \n\nGood luck!",

I was a CS guy, and we have so many folks at FAANG+ that I always knew of someone who\u2019d be down to refer me and give me tips for the interview process. Given how many students end up at GS, JPM, McKinsey, Bain etc. I imagine you\u2019ll have a similar experience as I did. Strength of your alumni network for recruiting solely depends on where you\u2019re trying to go, but there will be a Brown grad at every prestigious firm out there:)",

Doesn\u2019t mean you have to follow that, know other people who did humanities related majors and still ended up at one those places",

            "comment": "As I am currently looking to change jobs, I\u2019ve found the alumni network to be super helpful. They have been very willing to make introductions and speak to me for general advice. In addition to speaking to alumni, I would encourage you to grab coffee / chat with juniors and seniors at Brown through the Econ peer advising or clubs, etc. It will be helpful to hear their advice and perspectives. You can ask them for advice on how to contact alumni, finding internships, and courses to take. It\u2019s also great to build your contacts so that when you do graduate, you have people to reach out to for advice who are a few years out. Also, most professors are super generous with their time. I really enjoyed talking to a couple professor at Brown who provided me with great career / life advice, so I really encourage students to go to office hours. When reaching out, I agree with having a clear outcome and a few times in mind is helpful. I would start with some context about yourself to frame the conversation and be prepared with ~8 questions (start with more general like why they picked their career and the best part about their job and then get more specific). Asking great questions is a good way to show your interest and knowledge. For example, you can talk about something you read or heard in a podcast and ask about how they think about the topic. I encourage you to keep an open mind about different opportunities and companies when networking. There\u2019s a lot out there other than finance and consulting and there\u2019s also a lot of niche roles within finance and consulting. I honestly wish I did more broad networking in college (outside of BB IB and MBB consulting).",

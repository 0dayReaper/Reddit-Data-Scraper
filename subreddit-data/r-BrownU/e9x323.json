    "postText": "Hi everyone.  I hope you are all doing well!  \n\nI never posted on here much, but I am a senior who applied Brown ED, and I'm making this post to bid a farwell to this sub since I was rejected.  This subreddit reminds me some of why I love Brown so much.  It's such a pleasant, accepting, and welcoming community, and I thank you all for that.  There's been a lot of useful advice written on here, which I have always appreciated.\n\nIf you are someone who got in for the Class of 2024, congratulations, and I really hope you enjoy your undergraduate education at Brown!\n\nI'll be back to apply for graduate school!\n\nHave a nice day.",

I wish you best of luck in the future journeys! You are such an awesome person and I am sure other amazing colleges will recognize it!",

Believe it or not, people here complain about Brown *all the time*. You will have an amazing college experience; don't get discouraged by this. You're worth it. Best of luck OP)",

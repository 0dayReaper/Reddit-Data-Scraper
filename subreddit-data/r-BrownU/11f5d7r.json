    "postText": "Currently waiting for my brown RD decision. Did a summer program there and have always absolutely loved it but applied to Yale REA and got in. Hoping to get into Brown too but I know the decision will be really hard for me if I do. Ultimately it will probs come down to student life/how happy I\u2019d be since they\u2019re both amazing schools. I know brown is like notoriously the chillest Ivy but can u guys just confirm that for me \ud83d\ude04",

            "comment": "I think generally on the happier side\u2014 there\u2019s not really a stress culture here, so while a lot of students do wind up stressed out, it\u2019s not a product of the culture more so just a personal difficulty balancing coursework and personal life. Imo the chillness of brown is a product of a low-pressure environment and the ability to take literally wtv courseload you want but it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not stressful/overwhelming at times.",

Considering the weight the uni name has towards recruiting for jobs/internships on top of everything else, it's all a very lucky combo I feel super privileged to be a part of. I'm less familiar with Yale's culture but I figure it's much more stressful, so if you do get into both, try and determine what your goals are and see which uni aligns with them more :)",

Brown students take their studies very seriously, and many spend large portions of their time with that as their sole priority. I think this is the case at any top school, the average student worked too hard to get there to not have this mindset.\n\nAt any school you'll have to find people who share your priorities and mindset, it's not like non-competitive, chill people don't exist at Yale. Likewise, toxicity and particularly tryhard attitudes certainly exist at Brown.\n\nAs other comments have mentioned, the professors are very nice and easygoing, SNC can take a lot of the pressure out of any class, and fellow students are almost always willing to collaborate. This is the key respect in which brown is chill imo",

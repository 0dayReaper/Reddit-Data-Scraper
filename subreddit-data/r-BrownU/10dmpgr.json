    "postText": "I got deferred early decision to brown and remembered that I worked with a phd student/ prof at brown over the summer. I asked them if they would be willing to write me a letter of recommendation and they said they would, and it is great. (Added bonus, they are in the content area in which I am interested). I\u2019m thinking of uploading it to my portal along with my letter of continued interest. Is this something that can help my odds? TIA!",

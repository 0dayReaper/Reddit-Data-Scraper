                    "comment": "I would guess it\u2019s bc of a couple of things. It\u2019s extremely hard to keep track of this type of spending in the moment. For example you could say the Dept of Defence\u2019s budget for the years of the war was cost of the war or just the very narrow cost of equipment and personnel who went to Afghanistan. In between those two are people worked on the war but it maybe wasn\u2019t their full time job, like support personnel who stayed in the states side. Not to mention things like CIA operations in and around the area\nSecondly, it shifts responsibility off of the administration for coming up with the number. It\u2019s hard to criticize them either inflating or deflating the cost in their favour. A university is some what impartial and as non partisan as you could get. The credibility of the Cost of War project is as good as it gets these days. Everyone from NYT, WSJ, Fox to MSNBC use the information in their reporting. \nLastly is just effort, why would you have a team in the White House spend months calculating the cost of war when someone else has already done it for you.",

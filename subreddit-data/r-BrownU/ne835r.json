    "postText": "ok so i already know that bc brown has the lowest endowment out of the ivies their financial aid is less generous but wtf is up with that. like online brown says they give full rides to anyone who\u2019s family income is under 60k which is great. but if you google the cost it doesn\u2019t reflect that. it says families making less than 30k a year pay 6k to brown. families making in between 30k-48k pay 6k a year to brown. and families making 48k-75k pay 14k to brown. i rlly don\u2019t get it. i don\u2019t mean to sound ungrateful bc that finantial aid is still good but if they\u2019re gonna market as full ride to families under 60k it should be a full ride. duke for example does a good job at this, they say under 60k income pays nothing and a quick google search confirms it within a thousand",

            "comment": "I applied to brown and a bunch of other schools that state they give full-rides and I think you may be reading into the information incorrectly. For example, the school I committed to gave me a \u201cfull-ride\u201d, which means *tuition AND room/meal plans* are paid for. These costs are about 95% of college expenses. However, I had to pay the other 5%, which are miscellaneous student fees like textbooks, traveling fees (gas money, public transportation, plane tickets), grocery money, supply money, etc\u2026 \n\nIn my financial aid letters, this 5% extra cost was about $2k-$7k per year. This cost VARIES between student to student and is NOT A REQUIRED cost to students. You won\u2019t get kicked out of Brown if you don\u2019t pay this cost. The colleges are just ESTIMATING how much the average student will spend. \n\nI didn\u2019t commit to brown, but I remember reading on my financial aid letter that I qualified for some sort of University Scholarship where they would pay for my textbooks and supplies, if I provided a receipt.\n\nBasically, the google search you found may have projected these miscellaneous costs! The students do not pay the tuition or room/board. They are just paying their own personal supplies and expenses. This cost can be offset easily by a part-time job, help from parents, outside scholarships. You  won\u2019t have to take out loans!",

It's small compared to Harvard's endowment, but Harvard is a huge institution with a dozen different schools and hundreds of departments. Brown is an undergrad-focused institution with high spending in terms of capita for each student. My family has around 90k in income and still got 90% of our total net cost paid for by Brown.",

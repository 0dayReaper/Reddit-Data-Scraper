    "postText": "Hi, I'm a high school student looking to apply to Brown. I'm doing research on the school and I came across something I thought was really thought-provoking. Hope High School (right down the street from Brown) has a reading proficiency rating of 12% and a math proficiency rating of 5%. This was such a big surprise considering it's in such proximity to an Ivy League School! Upon further research, I found out it was ranked as one of the worst public school systems and has been taking action to change that ever since. Have any students on this subreddit been able to directly work with the elementary/ middle/ high school students in the area? Has the situation improved over the last few years? I know Brown has a few initiatives and programs where undergrads get to directly work with students in the area, but I just wanted to know from an insider point of view.",

            "comment": "I did not personally work with high school students while I was at Brown, but I did go through the Providence public school system for middle + high school, so I might have a bit of a different perspective. PPSD is pretty awful in how its run and consistently has very low testing results. PPSD is also a fairly large school system with I think \\~8ish high schools and very diverse student body. The overall scores/conditions were so bad that a few years ago, control was taken over by the state, but since then they've mostly failed to improve (to the point where they actually kept declining in testing scores, but part of that was probably due to the pandemic). I've visited my high school (not Hope) and teachers, and every time I hear about all the stupid stuff the PPSD administration does, and how its constantly failing. Just last summer, a number of teachers at my old hs (including one of the teachers that I would have considered the best teacher in the whole school) decided to leave unexpectedly because the school department kept refusing to meet pretty basic demands from the teachers. PPSD is often at odds with the teachers union because of all its issues, and its resulted in good teachers leaving, and the bad teachers staying, but also making it impossible to get rid of them.\n\nLike you mentioned, there are definitely programs at Brown that let you tutor and help out kids at the providence public schools, which is fantastic, but the school department is not really improving at all. As for its proximity to Brown: there are two private schools (Moses Brown and Wheeler) that are even closer to Brown (and in Wheeler's case even share a field with Brown) that are your typical upper class private schools that perform fairly highly and send most of their students to competitive colleges.",

I got involved through Brown Tutoring Corps, which is a newly formed amalgamation of tutoring clubs around campus. It took a while for the club to get going because PPSD is so\u2026 yeah\u2026, but the teachers are very, very happy to have us around. So if you\u2019re interested in tackling the issue from a boots-on-the-ground perspective, there are certainly established avenues for you to pursue.\n\nI\u2019m not sure of any structural impact Brown is currently having on PPSD though; Brown Tutoring Corps is pretty much a small bandaid on a completely necrotized foot. But I\u2019m sure if you are driven, there are people here (myself included) who would be very happy to try develop more ties between the University and PPSD, and drive real change from inside PPSD.",

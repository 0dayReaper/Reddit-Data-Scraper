You need to convince them that if you get accepted, you will attend.  Send one now.  Send another when you get your semester grades (assuming they are good).  Anytime you have an achievement, send them a LOCI telling them about it.  And tell them how Brown is still your top choice.",

He has two 9-week periods in a semester.  He gets grades for each 9-week period, and for the semester.  When he received his 9-week grades, he sent a LOCI telling them he just received all A's for the period.  He also reaffirmed that Brown was still his first choice.\n3. When he received his semester grades he sent a LOCI telling them he received all A's for the semester.  He also reaffirmed that Brown was still his first choice.\n4. His club lacrosse team won a state-wide tournament so he sent a LOCI telling them about this accomplishment.  He also reaffirmed that Brown was still his first choice.\n5. He was promoted to Core Commander in JRAFROTC so he sent a LOCI telling them about this accomplishment.  He also reaffirmed that Brown was still his first choice.\n\nThere were a few other things that he sent a LOCI about, but I think you can get the idea from the above.",

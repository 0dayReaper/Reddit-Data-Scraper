            "comment": "There\u2019s not really much you can do to definitively secure a place. Just try to be quick on the draw when registration comes, so to speak. There have been plenty of times where someone has had something loaded into their cart and had their finger over the button waiting for registration to begin, and even then they didn\u2019t get a spot. When trying to get into a popular class, a lot of it is luck.\n\nIf you don\u2019t get in at first, try shopping it! Show the professor you\u2019re interested, be engaged, etc. That might - big emphasis on the might- make the professor consider sending you an override code when shopping period ends",

The override codes are then given out by the results of the lottery.\n\nI'm not up to date with the timing, but normally lottery spots for this semester should have already been given out. You can email the section professors to find out more.\n\nShowing up on the first day may be helpful if the professor is generous, but obviously no guarantees. Additionally, VISA100 is hard-capped at 20; the professors are usually not allowed to exceed 20.\n\nEDIT: I have heard of some sections reserving some lottery spots for incoming freshmen in the fall. I'm not sure how this works because I took VISA100 in the spring.",

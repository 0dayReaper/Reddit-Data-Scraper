If you are on financial aid and your plan from home cannot be transferred over (e.g. Kaiser, Medicaid), then you should be able to request coverage for Brown\u2019s student plan.

I'm currently deciding between upenn and brown, my hesitation about brown is the lack of minors, so if anyone has advice about that too that'd be great!",

They usually offer the same greens and fruits for the smoothie base, and then you can choose a liquid (OJ, milks, juices, and yogurts) and add-ons (chia seeds, ginger, honey, etc). My go-to is strawberry, blueberry, mango, spinach/kale, OJ, strawberry yogurt, honey, and a little ice. I find that it's a good way for me to sneak in my greens! Not sure if it's super worth it for flex points, though; it's like $6.50. But if you're on a meal plan and don't mind spending your swipes, you can do one swipe for a smoothie + three sides (chips, fruits, snacks).",

So, coming here, I wasn't used to major exam prep or having an effective study plan; it took some trial and error to find what worked for me and what didn't. However, don't be intimidated by the change in environment! There are lots of peeps here who feel the same, and lots of resources to utilize :) Some helpful ways include attending TA hours, conference sections, and exam review sessions, attending live lectures in person, forming study groups, reviewing your previous exams and problem sets, reading the chapter and writing some key point notes beforehand, and so much more; you just have to see what's your groove. Definitely don't be afraid to reach out for help, though, as your professors and TAs are there for you. Let them know what you need help with or if you need further clarification on something!\n\nAlso want to note that courses are a lot easier to manage if it's something you enjoy, so utilize the shopping period. If it's a class that you're interested in, but you want it to be chill, S/NC it!",

I personally postulate that you can be materially more intelligent, naturally very competent yet still do materially worse than peers who have been at a school that requires you to develop your academic ability your entire life.\n\nHere are my suggestions. Take easy classes your first semester and take your studying seriously. Take first year seminars (designed to be slightly less rigorous +unique content + great way to make friends!). Ab studying, I\u2019m not kidding, you have to physically force yourself to study without your phone or others until you get good at it and make it one with you.\n\nTLDR; don\u2019t get wrecked your first semester. Take an easier / more forgiving courseload (some options are FYS/SNC/3 classes/take 4 and drop 1 class) and work hard to develop your work ethic. Best of luck :)",

Since freshman year, I have not used it a single time for school or for work... literally just my Macbook Pro.\n\nRealize that part of what you're paying for with macos is the convenience and \"babying\" that folks shit on all the time. 1) Things just work, like Windows 2) it's very hard to break things due to minor user errors while still getting all the functionality you would want, like Windows, and rarely if ever will it break itself/ crash, like Linux (and very much *unlike* Windows) 3) Apple's been great as far as I'm concerned and any issue I've ever run into fucking around with something has had a thread somewhere, including tampering with SIP (low level security function) to use Yabai (a window manager). You don't really get that with Microsoft in the same way, and that almost doesn't exist on Linux -- maybe Ubuntu. 4) Basically everything you will need to use for your CS degree will exist on Linux and often by extension macos, but you're rolling the dice much more often with Windows. There's a reason WSL exists without any analogue for DOS on Linux/ macos machines (obviously, dual booting/ Bootcamp does not count). 5) W.r.t. security, you're mostly on your own on Linux, but this is much less so the case on macos.\n\nIf you're already very good with Linux, maybe you might as well get a Linux laptop. If I were to get a new laptop, would probably get some system76 or like a Dell XPS and immediately delete Windows/ install Manjaro or something. Notably, my needs and where I thought I'd be + perceptions of what I would need for that have changed significantly since 2019 when I got the Macbook.",

The minutiae of the specs are mostly inconsequential; barring you taking some graduate graphics or numerical methods course (wherein you\u2019d likely have resources for serious compute as needed anyways), nothing gets all that computationally heavy, but it never hurts to have more, I guess.\n\nNever gotten close to using a terabyte of storage; been fine with 16gb DDR4; I think the M1 and M2 are on average much faster than the Intel processors too (mine is an i9). Don\u2019t worry too much about the battery life\u2026 just get in the habit of bringing it with you and be wise about things (the more shit you have running, the faster it depletes, obviously). Only warning is that 16\u201d screen is quite large. Gets annoying on airplanes since it just barely fits even in Delta Comfort+",

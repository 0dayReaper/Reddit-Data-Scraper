            "comment": "A liberal arts education is an education that covers several areas of knowledge. While most colleges have a core curriculum with requirements in different areas of knowledge that college has specified, Brown's open curriculum allows you to freely explore your interests without such specifications or requirements.\n\n\n\nHere's how Brown puts it:\n\n\n&gt;Liberal Learning at Brown\n\n&gt;What does it mean to be broadly educated? The first Western universities conceived of the liberal arts as seven distinct modes of thought, three based on language (grammar, rhetoric, and logic), and four on number (arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy). While this structure has changed over the centuries, the basic concept has endured. A modern liberal arts education is still defined in terms of a core curriculum comprised of several areas of knowledge.\n\n\n&gt;At Brown, rather than specifying these areas, we challenge you to develop your own core. Our open curriculum ensures you great freedom in directing the course of your education, but it also expects you to remain open to people, ideas, and experiences that may be entirely new. By cultivating such openness, you will learn to make the most of the freedom you have, and to chart the broadest possible intellectual journey.\n\n\n&gt;Each student's journey through the Brown curriculum is unique, and each semester of study constitutes a chapter in their own curricular narratives.\n\nhttps://www.brown.edu/academics/college/degree/curriculum\n\n\n\n\n\nSo to answer your question, yes, Brown offers a liberal arts education, as long as you explore a broad range of topics and areas of knowledge",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a public policy major, so I feel like I can give you a pretty good idea.\n\n1) The financial aid isn\u2019t terrible. Generally, it will cover whatever demonstrated need your Fafsa shows. If you make under 60k with no assets, you get a full ride. If you make under 125k, you get full tuition paid.\n\n2. It\u2019s a mix, I would say. Brown is often referred to as laid back, but classes are still very rigorous and people often end up studying late into the night. \n\n3. In some ways, both. It depends on what you make of it. Some people use the extra latitude given to take easy classes. Others challenge themselves by taking classes in subjects they\u2019re unfamiliar with. I will note however that it\u2019s important to remember that the open curriculum doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t any requirements. You still have requirements for your selected major/s\n\n4. Most of the professors are fairly nice. A lot of them have really felt like people you could sit down and have a drink with. That isn\u2019t to say that there aren\u2019t hardasses on campus, but the average brown professor is more than willing to help a student out, point you to additional resources, offer extensions, etc.\n\n5. I really can\u2019t speak to this because this is a very subjective measure. All I\u2019ll say is that Amherst is a great school, but Brown is Ivy\n\n6. We have a very good poli sci/public policy department that has world-renowned experts who have worked closely in the subject. The Watson Institute counts world leaders among its faculty. Research done by the Watson has informed decisions made by the Federal government.",

I took my time shopping around different labs and many of them had offered a spot if I wanted, but ultimately you want to go somewhere your personality and research project interests are a good fit.\n\nI\u2019ve heard finding research can be really hard at some schools, but at Brown and in general it\u2019s really a matter of sending emails to the PIs of labs you are interested in with an intro paragraph and a CV/resume. Sometimes they might not reply right away, so be persistent with follow up emails.",

I'd say the culture depends who you choose to spend your time with. I knew people who partied most of the week and people who spent most waking hours at the sci li, and everything in between.",

I think this really depends on your field, friend group, etc. I think the stereotypes of being collaborative/not cutthroat, 420-friendly, liberal, etc. are generally true, but you\u2019ll find like-minded people regardless of your views. For ex., most of my friends are what most people would describe as \u201cfinance snakes\u201d (Wharton stereotype).\n\n3. Slack off 100%. I was a STEM major and only took the bare minimum requirements for my major and also took a lot of classes S/NC (particularly classes that weren\u2019t easy As). Graduated with almost a 4.0 GPA because it\u2019s so easy to game Brown\u2019s system.\n\n4. Idk. Never bothered getting to know them. Probably similar across schools tbh.\n\n5. Brown 100%. I\u2019m 5-10 years removed from college, and to this day the Ivy League branding still goes a long way, especially since I\u2019m in a prestige-obsessed field (finance). Being on the other seat now, when we screen resumes, if you don\u2019t go to an Ivy/Stanford/UChicago/Duke/etc., your resume is 99% going to the \u201ctoss\u201d pile unless you have something else going for you (minority, connections, extremely unique circumstances, etc.).\n\n6. Cannot comment but it\u2019s probably good with the Watson Institute, etc.",

Not sure about tech.\n\nBased on my convos, I did hear that\u2019s there\u2019s a bit of a hurdle to recruit for NYC/California-based roles since they\u2019re mostly a core for Chicago-based roles, but I\u2018ve def encountered a lot of them in NYC (less so in CA).",

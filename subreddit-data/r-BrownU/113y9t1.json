I\u2019ll be going with a sponsorship form my country that gives you 2000$ a month. Will that be enough to live in Providence without getting a job? I don\u2019t have a problem with getting a job but I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s harder for international students to get one. (Free health insurance is also provided by the sponsorship).",

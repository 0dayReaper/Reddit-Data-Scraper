Luckily there is now a rural students group. I also feel like the vibe changed at least a little post COVID and I hope the negativity has diminished considerably for those coming now.",

Everyone goes in thinking they\u2019re the center of the universe and if people don\u2019t completely meet their expectations you\u2019re a weird person. The only exception is\u2026\n\nProfessors: This is especially with humanities and anything social justice oriented but professors with great reputation from research don\u2019t give a fuck about their students or classes and if you criticize them at all people act like you kicked a puppy.\n\nResources: Harder to access than you think and really confusing. Every online resource Brown has feels like it\u2019s from the 2002 internet.\n\nPositives: What you\u2019d probably think. Open curriculum means workload is more manageable (although again if you don\u2019t work yourself to death and take advantage of it you are also treated as an incredibly weird person socially). Providence the city and the campus is really nice. Resources do exist if you try hard enough. Once you get through the surface level social dynamics the people who are cool are legitimately really interesting and fun people. I also want to say maybe things have gotten better socially since the pandemic at least a bit?",

But cultural differences kind of stopped me initially.\n\nI come from a really different place (NY) and I'm black. I don't think race should have any impact on how we conduct ourselves. But I didn't find a solid close friend group outside a few guys from the music department and the gaming club. I found the black ppl here to be nothing like the ones from home. I'm quiet so that didn't help either.\n\nThe people at Brown are just really strange in general if you ask me. Many are disconnected from the real world and are just completely delusional.\n\nWith the time you have left, or for whatever incoming freshman that's reading this try to find people that fit you. But if you don't then the most important words that you can learn are: **fuck everybody.** You'll feel so much better when you stop wasting your time trying to fit in, and spending it focusing on yourself. \n\nAcademically, I started of computer engineering because my parents wanted me to. I absolutely hated it. Even though I excelled in math/science in HS. At Brown it just didn't click for me. STEM is really unforgiving here depending on the class/professor. If you don't have a group to study or work with it, it makes it even harder.\n\nI remember failing the first midterm in the intro ENGN 30 class and one of the professors told me to suck it up and just make it through the four years. I remember going back to my dorm and crying myself to sleep.\n\nI hated the big lectures for CS. I wanted to kill myself as I sat there alone in a room with 250 people as I had no fucking clue what was going on. I failed/dropped a variety of classes my first year and a half.\n\nI eventually switched to the business  concentration BEO and took English/ literary arts classes for my free slots and I loved all of those classes. So academically I think Brown is really great, but only if you really enjoy the classes. I got close to a lot of professors and did a lot of work that felt meaningful to my development as a person and artist. Taking classes in other departments like CLIPS and TAPS was really fun too. I had a lot of fun in the music department too. Probably some of my better memories come from playing in the bands.\n\nOutside of Brown, Providence and RI is really fucking awesome. Newport is beautiful and you have to visit there. I recommend trying to make friends outside of Brown and with RI locals because they feel like actual real people.\n\nFor whatever time you have left, focus on finding a job with your senior year. That's the only thing that matters. I didn't really have anything lined up until I found something in the summer.\n\nLmk if you have any questions.",

I\u2019m black too and had been from a very white area that had race problems but had met more other black students at summer programs. Thought I\u2019d find a home among the black community and did a bit but mostly was waaaay worse than I expected. The majority of the black community was super negative and seemed to spend the majority of the time fighting itself. The women angry at the men. The darker skinned mad at the lighter skinned. They all fully embraced cancel culture and not only didn\u2019t seem invested in having a united black community but almost seemed to take pleasure in tearing it down. The few people who weren\u2019t like that were way too far in the other direction, way too Christianity obsessed and had tons of ignorant opinions on LGBT people. It honestly ended up making me think the race problems back in HS weren\u2019t so bad comparatively lol. And yet all that said nonblack students at Brown were probably even worse. \n\nThe main people I was friends with the first two years were black athletes from poor backgrounds (btw athletes are absolutely hated by Brown students but that\u2019s a whole other story altogether) and finally I found some more friends in the last couple years.\n\nThis is exactly the same advice I\u2019d give. Totally agree people feel disconnected and delusional and I only started to be happy when I started focusing on myself and stopped trying to fit in. That\u2019s when I met people like me. Because here\u2019s the dirty secret. Brown culture is made to make you not fit in. That\u2019s what the majority of the student body gets off on, even those who like to pretend to be accepting. Don\u2019t play their game.\n\nAnd Providence and RI are great.\n\nOnly other thing I\u2019d say is whatever you do don\u2019t take Africana like I did. If you\u2019re miserable in CS you at least get a good job at the end. Africana I thought would help me meet like minded black people and instead I don\u2019t make a single friend there. Africana is just as miserable as CS then you don\u2019t have a very useful degree.",

    "postText": "Read somewhere that Brown had sort of an \"glorified high school\" vibe which has me a little worried  ... I hated high school; all the cliques and social hierarchies made me feel constantly judged and I felt a lot of pressure to fit into the group which was miserable. I am also autistic which probably doesn't help :(\n\nLately I've been taking a lot of classes at my local state school campus, which is one of the biggest schools in the country with like 70,000 enrolled students, and have absolutely loved the vibe. Brown is a much smaller campus, so I'm a little worried about fitting in there. \n\nAny help appreciated, thanks!",

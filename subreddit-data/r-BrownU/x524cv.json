I don't think it's that hard of a course, but I had trouble juggling it with my other courses. I took it a bit later during a Summer and found it to be much easier. I liked the instructor much more and I was taking 1 other class while working full time. In my situation, none of the classes I would take later needed this course as a prerequisite, so I was fine with taking it later.",

From what I hear, Katz goes a bit fast over the content and I think he deals with so many people that it's kinda hard to get good help. I hear that he's a really good teacher, but the speed is the main issue. This was back in 2019, so that's more than enough time for him to change some things.",

            "comment": "Inclusivity and (relative) lack of elitism here is much better than for other schools that I\u2019ve heard about. I mean this for social events like getting into parties or even just making friends **and** for academic purposes, as our learning here feels collaborative and not cutthroat. In high school, I was certain I could be the best in any environment, even through the competition. But let me tell you, it feels so much nicer (and works better) to be friends with all your classmates and succeed as a group. This effect might stem from the lack of a standard curve in your classes that permits only so many A\u2019s, B\u2019s, etc. I could go on, but let me quickly plug the beautiful campus, great location, and multitude of interesting, easier classes you can take in a variety of concentrations.",

    "postText": "hi im in my third yr at brown with initial intentions of becoming an english professor. Im almost done w my english degree reccs just to learn that the prospects for becoming a professor these days r garbage. many qualified but few stable and financially worth it jobs... suddenly at a loss. I wanted to teach and do research and write and suddenly im doubting all of that. i have a year and a half worth of classes left (12-15 courses respectively) worth of space and im wondering if its possible to last minute tag on another major. I was briefly considering ux design (who isnt god help me) and while I genuinly find the field interesting i cant help but feel super behind and inept :0 a while back when i was feeling less scared i was doing research, reading a book on design and listening to several podcasts and videos and it did genuinly feel like something i could get good at. I also have an okay starting base when it comes into visual arts as its something ive enjoyed as a hobby and that i feel if i take more seriously could also help in molding what id look like as a ux designer. but is it ridiculous to start taking intro comp sci courses at my school halfway through my junior yr? im gna try at least to self study intro stuff this summer just to wade the comp sci waters idk pls advise",

            "comment": "CS + Music concentrator here (starting 4th year in a month):\n\nI don't think it's a bad idea to start CS at Brown even if you don't finish the concentration. \n\nI think when it comes to job interviews in CS, you learn everything you need to know to improve at technical interviews in the intro courses. After that, it's all requirements and intrest exploring in my opinion.\n\nI would say just make sure you finish a degree so you can at least graduate.\n\nYou definitely do not need to have a CS degree to work in CS. I'm pretty sure my boss's boss at my Summer Internships was an English major.\n\nAlso I would imagine that the CS work you're about to encounter will be VERY different to work you've done in other departments.\n\nI think you can do it, but it's gonna be pretty difficult. But not difficult in a way where I would advise you not to try. It's possible to start CS this late and do well.\n\nYou got any specific questions?",

            "comment": "I would advise you to study what you want at brown while you have the time, even if it doesn\u2019t result in a concentration. The issue with doing CS is that you need to start with intro courses that are ordinarily offered in pairs to be taken two semesters in a row, making it hard to jump in and knock out requirements immediately since most higher level courses require these intro courses as pre-reqs. So if you want to complete the CS double concentration you will probably have to take 3-4 CS courses in both semesters of senior year, which could be difficult. \n\nMy advice would be: start off by doing the intro courses this fall. You might want to look into cs19 (accelerated intro course where you finish the two semester intros in one semester, but it will be harder). You don\u2019t lose anything by completing intro courses so that you retain your option to concentrate in CS into your final 3 semesters. \n\nAlso, if you are interested in studying CS and UX design only for personal interest purpose (rather than for a job), consider auditing courses. Also note that you might be able to land a job with a bunch of curated CS courses related to UX and design on your transcript while having a single concentration in English. \n\nTl;dr : do intro courses for CS this fall to keep your prospects of concentrating in CS open, while you understand and give more thought to how you want to approach studying CS.",

            "comment": "First - how many courses do you absolutely NEED to take to complete your English degree?  Second - CS courses are useful even if you don\u2019t finish a full concentration.  For a career in industry, the intro sequence plus a few more courses are more than enough.  It\u2019s also enough to get admitted to many Masters programs.  Finally - there is tremendous crossover between writing and CS.\n\nI was (more than 50 years ago) fading out of Engineering and took my first CS course in my third year.  I was already in a 5-year program (Engin and PolySci).  I eventually graduated with a CS degree (well, back then it was still ApplMath).  I recently took Emeritus status after an academic career in CS.  So - it can be done.  Good luck.\n\nBe warned - the intro sequence in CS (esp the accelerated one) will require more hours of work than anything you\u2019ve ever done before.  The good news is that you will know after one semester whether you love it, or hate it.",

            "comment": "Hi 3rd year doing UI/UX here! To clear up some misconceptions that might help you feel more confident in your current progress: 1. UX Design requires neither CS(that\u2019s front end development) or visual arts(more UI/graphic design). If anything I would recommend taking some psych classes because it is focused on understanding user flow and cognitive biases. 2. It is a portfolio first field -so even if you graduate as an English major, you\u2019re still in a good place if you take time in your extracurriculars to develop a good portfolio. If you are serious about UX design, definitely reach out to some actual designers and set up a coffee chat -that way you can see if it\u2019s actually a field you want to invest your time in and not something that seems like the only option. You\u2019re not behind at all, so many people I know in UX made massive career pivots far later than you have. Just trust in yourself and get organized. Please feel free to reach out and chat more if you\u2019re interested in me connecting you to more specific resources. (edit: if you\u2019re worried about intro cs courses and just specifically want to do UX design, I would just take the non CS UI/UX class and not both with CS19 -again this backend stuff is not going to applicable when applying to jobs in UX)",

I\u2019m trying to decide between the two as a concentration requirement!\n\nI took AP Stats in high school and am okay with math, though definitely not a genius. What would you recommend?",

I am also doing the business econ track and transferred my intro stats requirement in from another school so I can't speak to either of these classes, but I can't imagine our version would be harder than APMA's? If I had to choose between the two I would choose the ECON.",

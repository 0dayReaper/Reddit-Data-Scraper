    "postText": "I was wondering if someone could tell me about the PLME Senate Program, just the basics of it regarding how it works and what it does.\n\nAlso, I was wondering what the acceptable GPA range is for someone who wants to get into PLME. I'm a junior who currently has 11 AP classes under his belt at one of the top ten most competitive schools in Texas, so I was wondering if Brown will take that into account when they see that I'm not the top of my class rank.",

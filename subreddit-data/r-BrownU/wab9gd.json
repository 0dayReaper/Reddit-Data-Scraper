    "postText": "Ayo, name's Kai. I'm a sophomore going into Cognitive Neuroscience. If you have any questions about doing Pre-med at Brown or a neuroscience/cog neuro concentration feel free to reach out even if this post gets crusty and old. I can also help with other majors (just not as well) or with any general questions you might have. You can DM me or email me on my brown email kai\\*\\*underscore\\*\\*[vestergaard@brown.edu](mailto:vestergaard@brown.edu).\n\nIf you're a first year stressing about this kind of stuff, you'll get a  \"Meiklejohn\", AKA a peer advisor, as well as a professor as a mentor to help with class selection and adjusting to college. You can also set up a  meeting with premed advisors, but in my experience, they aren't very helpful. They tend to overemphasize the open curriculum and don't give enough direction.\n\nIf you want to comment and ask questions I'll be happy to respond to them. If you have a  longer question, feel free to DM or email me. If you wanna talk about classes or have me look at your schedule, I'd be happy to! If you're thinking about applying to Brown or are a prospective student and wanna do a zoom call hit me up. Depending on my schedule, I might also be able to give a *very* unofficial tour of Brown if you're going to be in the area in August.\n\nI don't want the transition to college to be scary. There are plenty of people at Brown you can reach out to if things feel overwhelming or new to you. Just reach out! People here aren't super competitive, we want to help each other out.",

                    "comment": "So for both Brown and Cornell the deadline for early decision is November 1st. Early decision means that the choice is binding; if she gets into that early decision college, she will have to attend that college.\n\nIf she wants to go to med school, she can generally do any major. She will just have to take a bunch of required class for the application to med school. These are premed requirements/requisites. She could major in literature, architecture, classics, history, computer-science, biology, engineering, etc. as long as she takes these classes. These include chemistry, organic chemistry, physics A and B, math, stats, etc. (It depends on each med school).\n\nIf she's interested in Neuroscience, I suggest she look into majoring in Neuroscience. Many schools have a neurology or neurobiology degree. It'll be a way to explore her interests, and she always change her mind on what specialty she'll pursue later. I'm personally doing cognitive neuroscience and will likely pursue psychiatry, but I'm doing that cause that's what I'm interested in. Both Cornell and Brown have strong neuroscience programs, and at least according to rankings (which are not exactly reliable) they're similar.  From what I've seen of Brown's program, it is very strong with lots of innovative research.\n\nThe acceptance rate to Cornell is slightly inflated because they admit quite a few students from New York, so I would see them as both competitive for Early Decision (I wouldn't make a decision based on acceptance rate).\n\nWhile I am biased, I do think that Brown has a significantly better cultural overall than Cornell. From what I've heard Cornell has a culture of burnout and students are more competitive with each other. Cornell students tend to be the least happy out of all the Ivys. I personally did not apply for these reasons. I am *biased* but, Brown has a more collaborative environment with a more positive community. It tends to be called the happiest Ivy.\n\nBrown has an open curriculum, which means it has no core requirements for the entire university. There are requirements for specific concentrations/majors though. This makes completing premed requirements easier. This also allows for easy exploration of classes outside of a specific major (music, literature, psychology, etc.). I am not as knowledgable about Cornell's perks, and this doesn't mean there aren't any.\n\nWhen applying to Brown there's also a video introduction that needs to be completed. [https://admission.brown.edu/first-year/video-introduction-alumni-interview](https://admission.brown.edu/first-year/video-introduction-alumni-interview) It's in place of an interview. These are mainly to show personality or passion not seen in other parts of the application.\n\nI also recommend her looking into the PLME program. There are a few extra essays. If she's accepted in the program, she's automatically accepted into Brown Medical School after completing her undergrad. She can apply as part of her early decision. (If she gets into early decision but not PLME, she will still have to go to Brown) [https://plme.med.brown.edu/](https://plme.med.brown.edu/)\n\nLemme know if you have any additional questions.",

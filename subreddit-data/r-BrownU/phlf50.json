    "postText": "Really, we're supposed to take our masks off and eat indoors in a crowded place? I don't understand why Brown doesn't have a policy that we all eat outside (or in our private rooms) for a couple of weeks until the second batch of tests come back and positive folks can quarantine. People are coming from all parts of the globe, and delta is raging in some places. It seems that the Brown administration didn't get the message that Delta spreads among vaccinated people, and some get pretty sick. The weather is supposed to be nice for the next two weeks, so it wouldn't be that hard - actually, it could be quite pleasant. I know I can eat outside, but what the whole community does affects all of us. Just a thought.",

            "comment": "i agree! but if you\u2019re looking for an answer, it\u2019s the CDC. As per [the CDC guidelines for restaurants and bars](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/organizations/business-employers/bars-restaurants.html): \r  \n\r\n\n&gt;Masks are currently recommended for employees and for customers as much as possible when not eating or drinking and when social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.\n\nim assuming that this informed Brown\u2019s policy, which can be found on [the Healthy Brown website](https://healthy.brown.edu/campus-activity-status) which states:\r  \n\r\n\n&gt;All individuals \u2013 regardless of vaccination status \u2013 must wear masks indoors, unless in a private, non-shared space (e.g., office or dorm room) or when actively eating.\n\nthis doesn\u2019t answer why the CDC thinks it\u2019s ok, but hopefully, it answers your (admittedly probably rhetorical) question here.",

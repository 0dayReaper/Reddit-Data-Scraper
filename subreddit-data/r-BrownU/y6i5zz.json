    "postText": "Throwaway account bc I don\u2019t want people to find out who I am lol. So I\u2019m a freshman doing the dual degree program between RISD and Brown. This year I\u2019m mostly at RISD and taking classes there, and it\u2019s the most difficult thing I\u2019ve ever done. Art school is brutal. My classes are 8 hours long and I have around 24 hours of art homework a week. I also have a Brown seminar and an art history lecture, which are mostly reading and writing based. I\u2019m being pummeled with work. I don\u2019t have time to socialize. I don\u2019t go out on the weekends, don\u2019t meet up with friends, all because I\u2019m working on homework. I also have zero Brown friends and zero time to make any. Just to give you an idea, I went out on Sunday 2 weeks ago, and that caused such a pile up in my work that I had to pull 3 all nighters that week. I\u2019m sleeping maybe 5 hours a night. Is there any advice or anyway I could seek some sort of help?? I feel completely out of my depth and dealing with each school day is incredibly daunting.",

I admittedly don\u2019t know much about RISD but Brown really cares about its retention rate \u2014 they do not want you to drop out and will do everything they can to help. I dealt with some health issues during my time at Brown and in my experience the deans were all tremendously kind and helpful. They can point you towards any available resources and help you navigate this. Don\u2019t wait until things get too out of control. It may also be worth it to schedule an appointment with CAPS \u2014 it sounds like you aren\u2019t getting nearly enough sleep and that is just going to exacerbate the issue. Talking to someone and/or medication may help with the stress.",

If you're not going to a party and experimenting w something you're not at uni. Brown has a wonderful campus life which cannot be said for cutthroat ivys like Harvard. \n\nBeing able to attend brown, dartmouth, or columbia without having ANY fun? Nawwww that aint right. If ya wanna be a sociopath go to yale or something.",

            "comment": "My first semester was pretty brutal and I wanted to quit. I'm now on my 7th semester and sometimes I still wanna quit, but I'm too far in and I can't give up the potential rewards.\n\nIt's easy to look around and see all of your peers having fun. You gotta remind yourself why you're doing what your doing. If you got a good reason, you gotta keep pushing.\n\nI did the double and tripple all nighter thing in my first and second year. You get better at managing time and more efficient as you push on. Please consider throwaway classes to lessen the load. Looking back, I can see that I made some things harder on my lself than they needed to be.\n\nI crammed most of my reqs for Music and Comp Sci in my first 3 years and did basically no exploration along with working a job on campus. There were countless amounts of times where I had to look at my peers having fun at events on my phone while I sat grinding at my computer in my dorm. But, as a result of all of this, I've achieved dreams I had for most of my life like learning to play jazz, composing, professionally mixing and mastering audio, landing a cybersecurity job, and a whole lot more.\n\nIt's hard to let people know you're struggling, but you gotta. Reach out to your deans and profs and even your classmates. I can tell you wanna make this work or else you wouldn't have taken the time to make a throwaway account and vent to a bunch of strangers on Reddit.\n\nThe struggling doesn't make you weak. I failed a class in my first semester at Brown and some people did say things to me that weren't very respectful regarding that. You can't fear these people. People like that would cower in fear and freeze up of they ever faced the hardships you did.",

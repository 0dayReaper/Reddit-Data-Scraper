You need two semesters of organic chemistry first, so you\u2019d take this sophomore spring to satisfy your first WRIT requirement.\n\nIn the social sciences, Social Psychology is usually WRIT. It\u2019s not this year because it\u2019s being taught by a different professor but check again next year. I also really enjoyed Classical Sociological Theory, but the readings can be a lot.\n\nIn the humanities, I\u2019ve heard great things about The Place of Persons and Political Philosophy.\n\nAlso, if there\u2019s any you\u2019re already interested in, check on CAB again in the Fall. People tend to drop classes. You can also contact the professor of the course, as some of them give overrides and go over the enrollment limit.",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI'm researching colleges and I've started to look into Brown. I have a lot of varied interests, so I'm really into the Open Curriculum! \n\nHowever, I have heard a lot about Brown students being politically correct, extremely left-leaning, and generally being \"hippy\", for a lack of a better term. I'm a pretty moderate guy, but I'm definitely not left-leaning. I don't really have a personal problem with any of these things(I really don't care about what others do with their life) but I'm not sure if Brown is the place for me if these statements are true since I know that I don't fit the role of a stereotypical Brown student. I want to apply to colleges where I know I will fit in well, both academically and socially, so that's why I am putting so much thought into this. \n\nAre these stereotypes of Brown true? \n\nIf it matters, I plan on majoring in engineering!",

            "comment": "brown is really what you make of it, as is any other college, i\u2019d argue. i\u2019ve met several people leaning on either end of the political spectrum/graph. that being said, and while i don\u2019t know the exact statistics (so take my words with a grain of salt), i do believe the majority of the student body here is left-leaning (though i use that word quite liberally here, since what i really think is that most students here are just democrats, not leftists). granted, this is likely to be the case at any ivy league or most other top universities since it\u2019s a statistical fact that education is correlated with liberal ideologies. if you are are generally tolerant and open-minded, this should be no problem for you. however, if you truly want a college that aligns more consistently with your political views, i\u2019d perhaps suggest searching elsewhere, although i\u2019d definitely encourage coming to brown and seeking your truth through a fair evaluation of all perspectives here!",

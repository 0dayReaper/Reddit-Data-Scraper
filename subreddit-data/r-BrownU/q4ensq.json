    "postText": "Hello! This is totally a long shot, but I dropped my Samsung earbuds under my seat during a lecture in Barus and Holley Room 168 this Wednesday and wasn't able to find them after the lecture. I was wondering if anyone had found them/picked them up accidentally or knew someone who did. If you have any information please DM me! They are black Samsung galaxy buds and were dropped in their small, black rectangular case. I've been trying to track them and have been back and forth to the lecture hall and the lost-and-found but have had no luck. Thanks!",

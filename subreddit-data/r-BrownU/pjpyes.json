I know you are ready for normal life and are probably vaccinated, but some of us are immune compromised, and your wearing a mask can really help to protect us. Yes, immune compromised folks can be more careful around campus, but we really don't have a choice but to go through the hallways in our dorms. And there is Delta. I think that is why the University's policy is still that we wear masks in the halls. Thank you!!!",

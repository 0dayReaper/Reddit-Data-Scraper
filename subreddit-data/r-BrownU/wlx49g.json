    "postText": "Hey,\n\nI just got assigned into a triple in Woolley on the fourth floor. The room's size is 269 sq ft. It is in the middle and not a corner room.\n\nHas anyone lived in a similar place? Will the there be enough space? Is it a forced triple? How's the bathroom situation there? Any recommendations?\n\nThanks a lot",

Personally, I\u2019d say Emory/Woolley/Morriss/champlin are the best freshman dorms. Great location, semi private bathrooms, a dining hall in the building, and large rooms. My biggest recommendation for all first years in general is to go out and try to explore a ton of building on campus, almost all of them have a study space to some extent so even if studying in libraries around a lot of other people isn\u2019t your thing, you can almost always find a little private alcove somewhere to yourself if you know where to look. You being in a triple I imagine a little personal time will go a long way. But overall your situation will be good if you let it be, you\u2019ll adjust and woolley is a great dorm to be in",

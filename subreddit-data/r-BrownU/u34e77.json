    "postText": "Hi! I was recently admitted to Brown (yay) and I'm likely to be committing. However, I have a few questions that I'm not sure about as of now:\n  \n1: My intended concentration has shifted pretty significantly since filling out the application in December. My understanding is that under the Open Curriculum the initial concentration on the application has no effect for things like picking first-year classes or the concentration you end up studying. Is that correct?\n  \n2: Continuing from the previous question, does the initial concentration have any effect on campus life, such as first-year advisor / dorm assignment? If there is, is there a way to change the initial advisor/dorm/other aspect?\n  \n3: Do you have any other advice for first year students?\n  \nI'm really excited to join Brown this September and thanks in advance for the help!",

            "comment": "1. you're right, it's not uncommon to completely abandon the major you thought you'd do when you applied.\n2. your concentration has pretty much nothing to do with campus life your first year. Your academic interest can inform clubs you might join or classes you might take, both of which can have an impact on your social life, but will not influence your dorm assignment. Your first-year advisor will also depend on your initial concentration, but your advising group will probably not influence your friend group too much (i'm not friends with anyone in mine)\n3. try everything, but know that it's better to quit things than to stretch yourself too thin in your first year. you don't need to have an incredible resume your first year - just make friends, learn, and adjust to college! good luck!",

I still want the help/chance to know people but I imagine it would be pretty awkward talking to my advisor in my intended concentration about another concentration lol",

You aren\u2019t even a committed student yet so they haven\u2019t decided any of that for you. I\u2019m not sure who to contact but perhaps ask admissions as a first step. \n\nAlso, plenty of people are super undecided so if you do end up with a first year advisor that doesn\u2019t fully fit what you think you\u2019ll end up doing, you won\u2019t be alone and your advisor will likely be experienced, will know students aren\u2019t committed to concentrations, and can still be very helpful. \n\nI hope that you have a great time at Brown and explore all the concentrations that interest you!",

I feel like my intended concentration and my involvement in it played a large part in my admission, in addition to it being less popular while the new concentration is significantly more popular. Do you think asking for this has any chance of resulting in trouble such like rescinding admission?",

Sure you come to college to learn, but at the same time, freshman year is the time to meet plenty of people and experiment with new hobbies/clubs. You won't have the opportunity to do those things if you're bogged down with 4-5 really hard classes. Trust me, you'll have the opportunity to push yourself academically in your later years when other things in your college life are more settled.",

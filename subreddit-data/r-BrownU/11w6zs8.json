            "comment": "This could be misleading. Some of the answers will depend more on the individual (e.g., someone who would love it anywhere, not just at Brown); others will be about Brown (e.g., someone who says \"horrible\" but who would thrive in a different institutional setting). It is probably important to differentiate as much as possible here, and not draw conclusions about \"mental health at Brown\" based on this.",

So many struggle with loneliness and depression, but it really helps to share your challenges with a professional. It\u2019s very brave to reach out for help.",

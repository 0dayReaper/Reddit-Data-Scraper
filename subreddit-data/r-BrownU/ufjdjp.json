I am however also incredibly nervous for ivy leauge academics, as I come from a very rual town in Texas so my high school isn't all that great. I'm just worried I might drown in the course difficulty, any advice?",

Stay on top of things so it's easier to take advantage of resources like office hours. Don't be hesitant to SNC a class you're not sure about. \n\nAbove all, make sure to prioritize your mental health. It doesn't matter if you get decent grades one semester if you're burnt out for the next four. If things get too tough don't be hesitant to reach out to professors to have a class marked incomplete so you can finish it off later. You can also drop a class at any time before final exams and it won't show up on your transcript. \n\nHave fun :).",

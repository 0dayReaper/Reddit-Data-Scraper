It was cool to learn about who Brown was named after and the way there was a mafia attached to slave trading and spear headed by John Brown himself. They sliced people's ears off and kidnapped government officials!",

            "comment": "Is this the book the incoming first-years are reading this year? If so, I didn't find the discussion of the reading to be very deep. It was about 50 minutes and we went over pretty general stuff like themes of the book, relating it to current events, favorite parts, etc. It was also pretty apparent that most people didn't read the book we were assigned when I did this assignment and just skimmed through for those short essay questions. \n\nI would say to read it and get a general feel of the book because the readings first-years are given is usually interesting, but don't feel like you need to analyze every chapter. It's not worth a grade and I don't remember anything coming from our work (like, not even feedback or anything) so don't stress! I hope this helps!",

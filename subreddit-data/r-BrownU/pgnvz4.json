    "postText": "[Brown Bytes](http://brownbytes.org) is a website for students to find free food on Brown's campus. It crawls the internet and uses complex machine learning algorithms to detect when free food is offered. \n\nBrown Bytes has taken sick leave since the Fall of 2020, but recently has been feeling a lot better. During COVID there were so few free food events! Brown Bytes was sad because it searched and searched the internet couldn't find any in-person events (much less with free food). \n\nBut Brown Bytes has taken some personal time, giving space for some personal improvement, and it's back with new features, compatibilities and most importantly: MORE FREE FOOD!\n\nIn the last two years the Brown Bytes team has grown from just one Brown student to more than 5. This has allowed the team to completely rebuild the website from the ground up, meaning more features and more functionalities. With the new system, the following things have been added:\n\n * Sign in with Google, Facebook! (this will help you stay signed in)\n * Mobile compatibility for you hungry people on the go\n * Much improved user profiles and commenting\n * Networking, where you can ask and answer questions about Brown!\n * Security enhancements\n\nBrown Bytes doesn't like it when you are hungry!\nCheck out the [Calendar](http://brownbytes.org/calendar), or read more about our [mission](http://brownbytes.org/about). \nOur full new feature set is described in the version report [here](https://github.com/player-eric/BrownBytes).",

We'll add that back in soon, but long term we would love to be able to integrate with peoples calendars automatically. \nAlthough this might require asking for calendar permissions.",

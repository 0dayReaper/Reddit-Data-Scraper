Sometimes it means they're literally outside, sometimes it means they're 10 minutes away.\n\nAnd then when you wait for them to call you because of this, then in the first case (where they text you when they get there), they call and say \"You need to check your phone we've been outside for 5 minutes\". Okay, how am I supposed to know that though? I'm not gonna stand outside in the cold waiting for it to get there...",

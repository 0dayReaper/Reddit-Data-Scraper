    "postText": "I do not understand why people find this so difficult. **Wear. Your. Mask.** Not under your chin, not barely touching the tip of your nose, not dangling an inch from your face. Wear it properly: tightly, over your nose and mouth, with no gaps. When you're standing in line. When you're walking down a hallway. When you're studying. Do not take it off to talk. Do not take it off to cough or sneeze. If someone asks you to put your mask on indoors, they are in the right and you are in the wrong; put the mask on, and keep it on. Infection rates among students are soaring, up tenfold since before Thanksgiving. It is disgraceful that the administration is turning a blind eye to this issue, presumably to save face after their unconscionable elimination of mandatory testing, but that is all the more reason students must follow basic public health practices.\n\nI am disgusted by the selfishness of many Brown students. We are living amid a pandemic that's killing thousands of people every day and leaving countless others\u2014yes, even \"invulnerable\" college students like you\u2014with debilitating long-term sequelae. Yet students here consistently demonstrate that they care more about the minor inconvenience of having their face covered than the basic well-being of others. They throw crowded, maskless parties with reckless disregard for the students who will suffer weeks, months, or perhaps lifetimes of consequences of the virus whose spread they are choosing to facilitate. **When you set foot into such a party, you are proclaiming that your so-called \"college experience\" is more important than the well-being and very lives of everyone on this campus**, especially those who are, or live with individuals who are, vulnerable or immunocompromised.\n\nTo the people coughing and sniffling and sneezing who maintain they \"just have a cold\": you have zero basis for that assumption. Practically no one has continued to voluntarily test without mandatory routine testing, and if you're the kind of person who goes around getting other people sick with your \"cold,\" I doubt you're one of the few who have. **If you have symptoms of any kind, go to UHS and get tested.** Contrary to the baseless rumor that's going around, you will not be sent to isolation housing unless you test positive. It takes all of fifteen minutes for UHS to administer a rapid test and get the results.\n\nFinally, if you're one of the few conscientious people who wear masks properly when indoors, get tested when they feel ill, and respect the wishes of those who are more cautious than university policy requires, thank you. I only hope more of the student body can learn this basic decency.",

Crossing Thayer street is orders of magnitude more risky than Covid at this point. I get that wearing a mask is not that invasive, and really should just be common courtesy, but this is no longer a pandemic. Its an endemic virus. Right now, more dangerous than the flu, but not by much, especially to the vaccinated. Maybe events with maskless people in scary to you, in which case I would suggest avoiding them. All the necessary places (classrooms, libraries, etc.) have high mask usage. You don\u2019t actually need to go to parties lol",

A vaccinated individual who shows symptoms can efficiently spread the virus so when that person decides to come to school and not wear a mask, they are putting everyone at risk. And this isn\u2019t just about the 99.5% of students who are vaccinated but the families and communities they may be bringing the virus back home to. Whether it\u2019s children, immunocompromised, elderly, etc. we all have people in our lives we need to protect. \n\nThis is the thing that blows my mind. People are just seeing this through the lens of how it affects them individually without considering the impact to communities and how this is a *public* health crisis. Sure, it\u2019s maybe only 10 times more deadly than the flu but if everyone gets it then that\u2019s millions of fucking people dead that didn\u2019t have to die.. grandparents or mother\u2019s and fathers that could still be with us today but aren\u2019t because people were too fucking consumed with the minor inconvenience of staying home when they felt sick. \n\nSo yeah, get tested, wear a mask if you feel ill and act like you give a fuck about your community.",

I was referring specifically to the idea in the comment that basically people who have any symptoms at all need to get tested. There are dozens of symptoms that we all experience every day, I tend to cough or sneeze at least twice, that doesn\u2019t mean I have Covid and it doesn\u2019t mean I need to drop everything and get tested.\n\nNot entirely sure why you think I\u2019m against masks, I\u2019m not. I wear a mask out of respect, to be polite. I was specifically saying that the comment expresses a sentiment that is simply alarmist and not fitting to the true risk of Covid. \n\nAnd the point of a vaccine is that not everyone can get it, with 90+% of old Americans vaccinated and 70% of the rest of the population vaccinated, the virus spreads almost entirely among the unvaccinated. \n\nAlso, tbh, your sense of moral superiority, as well as the sense of moral superiority present in the comment, do absolutely zero practical good.

You could have stayed home and taken classes asynchronously, but you didn't. Don't act surprised that people are going to parties in college.\n\nThe real entitlement is people like you wanting to police what others can do. The virus isn't going away any time soon and staying isolated from other people is not a good decision for a lot of people. You might be fine not hanging out in large groups, and that's perfectly fine. For some people, it brings them a lot of joy and is an integral part of their life. Things affect everyone differently, so it's up to you to decide what you want to do and how you want to live your life. For some people, staying isolated is a big cause of anxiety and depression, while other people prefer to be alone. Taking care of your mental health and looking out for your own wellbeing isn't entitlement, it's just giving yourself the respect you deserve :)",

That\u2019s exactly why I chose to return to campus. Arguing that people are participating in large unsafe gatherings to avoid isolation and then saying that if you\u2019re uncomfortable with that then you should have studied remotely is oxymoronic. I\u2019m not saying that people shouldn\u2019t hang out with their friends or even have small parties, but there have been several parties with dozens and dozens of unmasked people in small spaces happening over the course of the semester which is extremely and unnecessarily unsafe. Severely disappointed in the selfish and entitled attitude of member\u2019s of our community such as yourself.",

In fact, the whole reason we got the vaccine was so we could go back to doing normal stuff. I don\u2019t think you understand that you hold an opinion that only 1% of people hold here. Your views are the outlier, not mine. I would bet that at least 80% of people have been to an event you would deem hazardous and the other 19% don\u2019t care that other people do. The point is, people should do why they\u2019re comfortable with. If you\u2019re not comfortable going to a party, then don\u2019t go. And if you\u2019re not comfortable with other people going to parties, then stay home. But you shouldn\u2019t willingly come to campus and then try to tell other people what to do with their lives. That\u2019s entitlement. Expecting other people to do exactly as you do and exactly what you want.

I understand the frustration that this  \npandemic has been going on so long, but I do think things will get better.  \nPersonally, I think it's no big deal to wear a mask so that other people can  \nparticipate a bit more in our community.

Here were my go-tos:\n\n- If you need something big, like a whole cake, then Gregg\u2019s. Very good, and they make insane chocolate cakes. Great option for birthdays.\n- As other people have said, Aleppo Sweets is phenomenal. Pretty specific, though \u2014 you gotta be in the mood for baklava!\n-  Knead and PVDonuts are both great in their own ways, but you need to plan ahead and get donuts in the morning. Donuts are New England\u2019s real speciality, and these are some of the best in the country.\n- Here\u2019s my sleeper pick: the giant cookies at Meeting Street Cafe. They\u2019re as big as your head and so good. My all time favorite dessert in providence, hands down.",

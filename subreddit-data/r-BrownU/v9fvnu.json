Anyone know if that's true? Or do you happen to know the access code...? Bathrooms also seem to be locked now with an access code, so it would be great to have!",

Most likely, no one would ask to see a RISD ID. There'd be fewer people than at neighboring Barrington Beach \u2014 and, crucially, no need to pay for parking.\r  \n\r  \nThose days are over: Since 2020, visitors have been greeted by a locked gate, and RISD says it's decided to permanently restrict parking to faculty, students and staff...  \n\n\nFor more, check out the full story",

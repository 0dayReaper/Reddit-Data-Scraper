It more depends on whether you want a large or small university (Brown has 6,800, UCLA has 41,000), whether you wanna live on the east or west coast, weather, cost, and whether you like the Open curriculum.",

            "comment": "Since they're a similar cost, I'd choose Brown over UCLA for multiple reasons:\n\n* Being a private school Brown just has far more hand holding than UCLA can offer since it's like 1/4 of its size\n* Open Curriculum makes it really easy to double concentrate or take elective courses + changing your concentration if you ever want\n* Brown doesn't really have impacted courses or concentrations -- you can basically change into any concentration as long as you can complete the requirements before graduating, and you can add additional concentrations up till the semester before you graduate -- there are definitely smaller classes that are difficult to get into, but for the most part you can get into required classes for your concentration (especially in STEM)\n* No +/- grades -- an A is an A, but a high B is also the same as a low B -- overall this has helped me though (at least 75% of my As would be A-'s at another school)\n* I haven't used on-campus recruiting, but the Brown name is definitely helpful when it comes to finding internships\n* If you want to get involved in research it's definitely possible to do that -- Brown's undergrad population is like 4x as large as the graduate population so professors love undergrads -- at least in Bio it tends to be unpaid/on a volunteer basis, but Workday does have paid research postings and there's a sizable number of students who do an UTRA and get paid over the summer\n* As someone from the West Coast, the biggest con I have about Brown is the weather -- it can be very jarring if you're not used to having snow, rain, and sunshine all in the span of a week -- Providence is also far, far, far smaller than LA, but it still has most stuff a large city would have\n* Food at Brown is fine, definitely not as good as UCLA dining is known for -- same goes for the dorms -- fine, but nothing to write home about",

Honestly, if you're not from the US and aren't used to a large city (I know I wasn't) I'd recommend Providence solely because the College Hill neighborhood is extremely residential and pretty safe imo -- you have the option to go down into the city when you want, but also aren't in the city all the time",

This is a fairly rare set up and I\u2019m pretty sure UCLA\u2019s APMA is just a section of of their Math Department. This makes it generally not as well looked after. It also attracts the type of professors who are big into APMA because there\u2019s such a large community and a lot of room for them to work",

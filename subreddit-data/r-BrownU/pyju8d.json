            "comment": "Unless COVID has changed something, you should be able to pay with a credit card. For the traditional dining halls - Vdub and Ratty - it'll probably be pretty steep. I remember it was over $20 for a \"swipe\" or entry to the dining hall. However, you can stay as long as you like, so it could be worth it if you set up camp for a two meals. The Ratty is the classic big dining hall, so if you have to choose just one, go there.\n\nClassic foods to try: Cajun chicken pasta (not my cup of tea, but it's well-loved), Chicken Finger Friday (at the Vdub), made-to-order eggs (I lived off of this my sophomore and junior year), plantains! (at the Ratty), coffee milk (a RI delicacy - mix in hot chocolate or with chocolate milk)\n\nThe Blue Room, Andrew's Commons, Ivy Room, and Jo's are all a la carte, so you pay for the items individually. Prices should be listed by the item or on a placard.\n\nClassic foods to try: Blue Room muffins (I'm also partial to the lunch sandwiches when they have focaccia), Andrew's unique pizza flavors, breakfast burritos, and make-your-own pasta (really all the made-to-order food: curry, pho, fried rice, etc.), Ivy Room smoothies and avocado toast, and of course, Jo's spicy with (with mozz sticks if you dare, or just seasoned fries or tots)\n\nThere are also some carts in the libraries and Engineering building. I never bothered with those but they are also a la carte, leaning heavier on packaged food.",

I've had some really great meals there - there's a salmon with fennel that I still think about, and I've never had a bad sandwich or salad there. You might be able to get an invitation from a professor or administrator and eat on their dime, or sometimes it's used as a meeting location. I'm pretty sure you can go on your own too.",

            "comment": "Yes, but paying with a card is a terrible deal. A much better deal is to wait by the exit doors of the ratty until someone leaves and just walk in. I've done this dozens of times with no issue, but if someone confronts you you can just say you think you dropped your phone by a table in the back and need to go grab it.",

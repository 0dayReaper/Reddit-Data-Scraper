I'm mostly hoping to satisfy the writing requirement and refrain from time-consuming classes during my first few months in the US, but I'm open to all recommendations!",

The motivation to read the books was the rare opportunity to meet and question the authors themselves. It was a super cool experience that I don\u2019t think any other FYS can match.",

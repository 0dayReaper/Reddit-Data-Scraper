    "postText": "Title. Took a year off middle of COVID (start my 5th semester in the fall) and trying to figure out any way to accelerate grad. Looks like early grad is pretty difficult to get approval for, so I was peeking through the ASK [transfer credit](https://ask.brown.edu/transfer_credits/information/index) site and figured there might be some way to quickly take a bunch of classes (perhaps over the summer) to speed things up. Has anyone done this successfully?",

Those courses obviously require approval. So at most you can theoretically become a .5er, but unless you take five classes every semester, there\u2019s no way you can graduate more than a semester early given the 30 credit graduation req",

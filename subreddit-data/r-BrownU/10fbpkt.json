There's also nowhere to attach a monitor arm because the desk has this annoying backing which makes the desk-clip style impossible to mount.\n\nYou might just have to learn to live without it.\nDual monitors might work if they're small (24-inch, or 27-inch at most)\nAssuming you have the money, you should probably just buy a single 32/34-inch monitor.",

The computers there have 2 monitors, and as said above, you can achieve 3 monitors by just using your laptop. that's what i did, and it was great imo. I spent much more time in the lab than in my room.",

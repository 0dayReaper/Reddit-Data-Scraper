Unfortunately, only one of us(parents) will be able to help him make the move up there.  What advice would you give a parent to help with the move up there?  I'm just trying to make it easier for him, and his mom by being as best prepared beforehand.   What should he absolutely take from home?  What should he definitely leave behind (other than his parents)?",

The rest is just the obvious stuff like hygiene stuff, school supplies, etc. would also suggest getting him a winter coat and some boots if he doesn\u2019t already have some",

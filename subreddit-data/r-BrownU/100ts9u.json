I was wondering if anyone in this subreddit knows what this interview may be like, e.g., what kind of questions could I expect?",

Eg, digital humanities connecting arts with technology, or an international angle that makes use of the Watson Inst etc. \n\nIf you have ideas for funding they\u2019ll love that (grants, external fellowships etc).\n\nGood luck!",

Every university claims its work is interdisciplinary, but it's often bullshit when you go a little deeper. I don't know anything about neuroscience, but if you want to stroke the faculty members' egos, mention that Brown \u2013 unlike so many top-flight places \u2013\u00a0actually prizes interdisciplinary research and teaching. And if you have a couple actual examples (from the web, eg) you can cite them. But they will call you on it, so be prepared to give an ACTUAL answer about how Brown connects disparate fields.\n\n\\[Edit: Someone there might flat out say \"We are just a bunch of silos, like everywhere else\" but even if that's true, individual projects or topics can connect with individuals from any other department, so you should be positive about piercing the silos, without sounding naive or pollyanna-ish.\\]",

The more potential committee members you can name (3 or 4) based on fit and shared research interests, the better. You should be able to find the CVs of any faculty members, so look over those for any faculty member you think fits with your interests. Look them up on Google scholar to see what their most influential work has been (like what has been cited the most). Give those papers a look along with any paper you think is relevant to your work. Cite these during the interview when trying to demonstrate how your work will fit with others. Good luck!",

How you can contribute to the department's ongoing research is a major factor in getting into a Ph.D. program. Upwards of 90% of applicants probably have the grades, but can you run a section? A lab? Grade an essay or proofs? Tenured faculty are going to want to know.",

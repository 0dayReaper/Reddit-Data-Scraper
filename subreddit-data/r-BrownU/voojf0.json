            "comment": "You will most likely be living with other transfers unless you're part of the weird 1% that the housing office throws in a random building (they know who they are). This past year, transfers predominantly lived in Wayland House, which is a really good dorm as far as locations go.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if they house transfers at Wayland again this year, so here are some specs:\n\n* **Demographics:** mostly (3/4?) transfers with a couple freshmen thrown in the mix.\n* **Bathrooms:** mostly gender-neutral communal bathrooms with a few traditional male/female bathrooms located throughout the building. The suites on the top floor have their own bathrooms.\n* **Location:** As I said earlier, the location cannot be beat. You'll be living in the same quad (Wriston) as the main chow hall (The Ratty) and also be right across the street from the Main Green. Wriston Quad is also on the south side of campus, where most of the major lecture halls are located, so most of your classes would take less than five minutes to walk to. The only shit part about Wriston Quad is that it's far from the gym, but it doesn't snow in Providence, so it's no big deal if you get a little extra exercise.\n* Rooms: Not bad...a mix of singles, doubles, and triples... mostly doubles though. Each inmate gets a closet, a desk, and a comfy mattress to rest on.\n* **Amenities:**\n   * Laundry room with 1-4 washers and 1-4 dryers ($1.50 per use) - and you'll find out why I'm writing 1-4.\n   * 3 basic kitchens, including a kosher kitchen which requires a key from ResLife\n   * Bike storage room on the south side\n   * \"Free (flavored) condom\" pouch with President Paxson's portrait on it. \n   * A single urinal on the north side\n   * A lounge room with a broken pool table, a broken TV, a boarded up fireplace, and some couches with random stains of who knows what. I recommend you lock the door when you're done because people from Keeney across the street like to trash it for some reason.\n* **Other:** The main entrances are located under an arch.  There's this singing group that performs there on random evenings. They're very entertaining, but there were a couple instances when I was late for something because they were in the way, so keep that in mind loool.",

    "postText": "\\*i took the formatting and some questions from the previous post also asking about getting off the brown waitlist. \n\nSo I just got off the Brown waitlist today. I\u2019ve committed to Berkeley, but I\u2019m also seriously considering Brown.\n\nI am really interested in AI and economics (business) and Cognitive science. I have some questions about Brown:\n\n1. How\u2019s the job opportunities compared Berkeley?\n2. What is Providence like? (Opportunities, safety, fun, weather?)\n3. Unique things about Brown? Special certificates or Programs? \n4. I did not receive financial aid but the money is still somewhat of a burden to my parents (not bad enough for me to just go with instate tuition). My parents also want me to truly choose one where i think I will thrive. I would just need to get a job. Are there a lot of campus jobs that are good for students at Brown?\n5. How is Cognitive Science/Brain/Behavioral Sciences department at brown? I know Brown is not as strong as berkeley in some of these areas.\n6. I am a musician so how is the orchestra?\n7. What are some cons to brown?\n\nPlease let me know everything you love and hate about Brown. I have a week to respond to Brown (i will visit this coming Sunday but will ask for an extension). Anything is helpful!",

This is coming from the perspective of someone who\u2019s 5-10 years out of college and also in finance (fyi starting salary for IB first year out of college is ~$200k, probably a lot more for top quant jobs like Jane Street)\n\nAlso, maybe I\u2019m wrong but I think it will be difficult to get a top finance job coming from Berkeley DS \u2014 need to be in Haas.

Providence is a small city with good food / arts, and most is walkable from the campus, including a mall, the train station, a theatre, nice restaurants, and clubs. Weather is beautiful in the spring/fall but gets a bit drab over the winter. Snow can be fun when it happens, but most of winter is just cold. \n\n3. open curriculum!!!! ofc that\u2019s what everyone says but it really does shape your time at brown\u2014 you\u2019re able to pick whatever courseload you want and integrate things into your concentration very easily. \n\n4. there are a ton of campus jobs, some of which are pretty lucrative (being an RA), whereas others pay around $14 an hour. I currently have like four jobs and make a good amount of money / am able to balance with my school work.\n\n5. I\u2019ve taken a couple classes in the CLPS department and I\u2019ve enjoyed them! The intros are good broad classes and upper levels really get into the weeds about particular topics. They are a bit tough at times, but there\u2019s a lot of room in the majors within the department to customize to your fit so at least you\u2019ll take tough classes that you like?\n\n6. Orchestra is great! I know a ton of ppl in the orchestra as well as other groups such as wind symphony and jazz. If you join one of those groups, you\u2019ll have rehearsal 1 or 2 times a week, and have a concert at the end of the semester. There are also lots of opportunities to play in pits for shows if that\u2019s of interest to you!\n\n7. it\u2019s cold and the college really doesn\u2019t hold your hand\u2014 you need to be somewhat self reliant to design your own course load / find your own path in your department.",

            "comment": "I was in the same position as you in 2018, committed to Berkeley, got off Brown\u2019s waitlist, and  also planned to (and did) major in cog sci. Here are my answers, though take everything with a grain of salt bc I chose Brown lmao:\n\n1. Both have good alumni networks, but there\u2019s a far smaller graduate population at Brown, so it\u2019s easier to get your foot in the door at labs, both during the school year and for full time summer work. Though I did not end up going into research, I also found that it was really easy to pivot fields at Brown, through both coursework and on campus jobs like TAing. I think Brown encourages you to explore more which is the most valuable for finding not just any job, but the one you\u2019re fit for.\n\n2. Cute, quaint-ish city. Highly recommend exploring off campus as early as possible if you go. By and large safe near campus, although there was a string of pellet shootings(?) in 2022, so not very dangerous but scary. For what it\u2019s worth, I quite liked the Berkeley area too and the weathers better, but Providence is a great small city.\n\n3. There\u2019s a relatively new data proficiency certificate that\u2019s good if you don\u2019t wanna double major; it\u2019s kinda like a minor, which we don\u2019t have at Brown. Though tbh, as an CS/STEM leaning student, I highly highly recommend exploring community based learning (CBLR) classes and non academic programs at like the Swearer Center. It is highly valuable as a person to learn how to engage with real people and communities, and it\u2019s something employers like to see so you\u2019re more grounded and well rounded.\n\n4. Good selection of on campus jobs, although minimum wage in RI isn\u2019t very high ($13 now) and that\u2019s what you\u2019ll get for most Brown positions. If you\u2019re writing inclined, though, being a Writing Fellow or a student writer for the Brown Alumni Magazine is by far the best paying on campus job I\u2019ve come across in terms of workload vs pay.\n\n5. Cog sci is a small program, with not a ton of students or faculty or community feel. I pivoted out of it eventually, but never felt stifled while it was my main gig. My main takeaway is that it\u2019s not smart choosing based on program quality when you just finished high school. There is a good chance that what you think you\u2019re interested in won\u2019t pan out in the long run. I have recs for talented profs that are very supportive of undergrads, which will get you far no matter what.\n\n6. Brown has a good orchestra. Not anything crazy talented but the people I knew that did it enjoyed it. Do the Brown thing and explore other performance opps like chamber groups, jazz combos, theater, off campus performing. If you sing, I have all of the info lmao.\n\n7. There were definitely times when Brown simply did not have something available that suited my interests; there are plenty of opportunities to make your own course/student org/major, but a bigger school will just have more things likely. Admin can be frustrating, some facilities whether that be labs or housing or whatever aren\u2019t as nice or modern. The community also self segregated, which happens on every campus ofc, but you\u2019ll find that after freshman year, there are plenty of friend groups that are all white or rich or from private school. In general there can be a classist/elitist/\u201cquirky white person who says they\u2019re anti racist but definitely doesn\u2019t get it\u201d vibe. But it\u2019s relatively easy to find your people, students are by and large very nice and supportive of one another (partially due to the low competition and grade inflation nature of Brown). I will say that every time I visited another college while at Brown, I walked away happy that I was at my school.\n\nSorry for the long messages haha. Lmk if you have any more questions.",

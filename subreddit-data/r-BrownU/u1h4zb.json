    "postText": "I recently got accepted into a Masters program at Brown and am very excited about it! I accepted my offer last week as well.\n\nHowever, whenever I have any questions and I send emails/call, the emails go unanswered and the calls end with me being asked to leave messages without being able to talk to anyone. Is this normal for graduate programs at Brown? If so, I'm a bit concerned about spending the next two years here.\n\nETA: I'm also an international student so there are extra steps involved, which is making me extra anxious.",

Master's degrees all fall either under the Graduate School (historically more funding and staff) or under the School of Professional Studies (historically understaffed but they just got a new Dean who takes over in 2 months).\n\nDM me your program and the email address that's not responding and I'll email whomever is above and copy you. You'll get a response.",

For admissions questions, try emailing Rose Benar or Denise Arver, they usually respond the fastest when I have any questions about the program. Don't even bother emailing the head of the department, they almost never respond to emails and when they do, it's over a week later",

    "postText": "Hi Brown reddit community! I was very tentative about posting this on here, but I would like to hear some honest thoughts about my situation from both sides (brown and yale). Be as biased or unbiased as you\u2019d like. Why should I choose Brown? or maybe why not? \n\nI\u2019m currently torn between Yale and the Brown RISD Dual Degree program. A little background about me: I\u2019m a painter, love art, and have been creating since I could remember. I also want to study international relations and study abroad. Yale is my dream school. I love the campus, the vibes, the community\u2026 everything. It\u2019s my perfect fit school-wise. Yale is pretty strong in terms of visual arts and ofc has a great global affairs program as well. I\u2019d be double majoring, which I know is a lot of work. My other option is the Brown RISD Dual Degree program. For context, RISD is the top art school in the nation. I\u2019d be a full time student at both schools for 5 years, working to get a BFA in painting at RISD and a BA in international and public affairs at Brown. I have to create a capstone project (basically thesis and portfolio) that combines my two majors during my fifth year. Also a lot of work. In terms of education, the BRDD offers EXACTLY what I\u2019m looking for. My dream program. But: it is somewhat inflexible and doesn\u2019t allow me to explore other areas of interest in much depth. I really want to study abroad, and it\u2019s difficult to say where that fits in for the dual degree, even in the summer. Also no language learning is possible in my first year, which is something I hoped to do in college. \nI don\u2019t really care much about city/location, but for the record, Providence is amazing and one of the best cities I\u2019ve ever been to. Thoughts on what I should choose?",

            "comment": "As a Brown (A.B) and Yale (M.A.) alum, I was pretty surprised to see just how different the undergraduate experiences were at each school. I was fortunate enough to go directly from Brown to Yale after my undergraduate degree. I was surprised at the differences I experienced. \n\nYale\u2019s college system, I think, fundamentally changes the undergraduate experience. The colleges are really the anchor of one\u2019s experience there. Most students live in one for three of their four years after a shared residential freshman year. As such the colleges really separate the institution from the city. After Brown, I found this strange, but my friends who were YUg loved their colleges and loved the experience. I mean who wouldn\u2019t? One is part of an institution within an institution. The colleges themselves have incredible perks, like travel stipends, study abroad support etc outside of the \u201cuniversity\u201d itself. As a recent senior it was hard not to be jealous seeing friends getting travel stipends to work on their thesis in some beautiful country. \n\nMy experience at Brown was truly life changing. It was just one of the best and most transformative times of my life\u2026 cue Hollywood montage of #collegeyears. But what I found really special was the diversity of experiences that was open to me at the school. This included not just my classmates, but the way Brown is part of Providence\u2019s east side. I found my peers curious, humble, engaged, and passionate. Also all willing to go the extra mile to to help or expand their opportunities. It was a very special place. I learned to work with an institution to get resources that I wanted for projects I cared about, maybe this was more valuable than any stipend I could just have applied for. \n\nThat being said. Every. Yale. Student. Says the same. It is an amazing place for undergraduate education. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m not sure you can go wrong with either choice. If possible go visit, I think you\u2019ll get a better sense when your there.",

            "comment": "You have two amazing academic/artistic options and it really boils down to where you think you'll be a better cultural/happiness fit. \n\nCan't speak for Yale, but the sheer breadth of languages you could learn after your first year here is honestly a little insane - everything from Polish and Czech to Nahuatl and Yoruba. \n\n[The CLS here](https://cls.brown.edu/) is pretty great, and holds [language open hours](https://cls.brown.edu/opportunities-resources/undergraduate/cls-dug/open-hours) for people of all abilities, so even if you start learning a tiny bit on Duolingo, you'd be able to hop into those in your first year.",

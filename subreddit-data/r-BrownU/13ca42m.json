Could anyone talk about their experience with stress, competition, and how outcome driven (grades, accomplishments, internships, etc) Brown is? I really don\u2019t think I can handle another 4 years of constantly stressing about my grades and work.\n\nDo you find enough time to hang out with friends, enjoy the city, and participate in activities (intramural, clubs etc.) alongside your course workloads?\n\nEdit: majoring in CS",

You get some sort of arbitrage where you get a top degree in many fields (CS, premed, science, Econ (idk ab engineering)) but the concentration requirements are as low as it gets and the classes are less stressful compared to other schools.\n\nWould love to field counters to this point but this is largely mine and my friends experience. CS? Still stressful ofc but compared to a Dart CS or Uchicago CS it has a better work life balance.\n\nTLDR; Brown offers some of the best value in terms of prestige/outcomes and not cranking for 4 years",

            "comment": "cs concentrator here\n\nbeauty of brown is you can personalize exactly how much work you want to put into it \u2014 and get that much in return.\n\nunless you\u2019re planning to go to grad school or applying to roles that require a transcript (unusual for cs), you can choose to \u201cpass/fail\u201d every single cs class, do the minimum number of required cs courses (~10 for the AB out of total 32 courses) and still graduate with a degree. \n\nwith that approach and lots of interview prep, you can land some pretty serious internships &amp; new grad roles in SWE (think google)\n\notherwise there are always some intense courses like cs19 (accelerated intro), cs1670 &amp; cs1690 (operating systems with lab) and more and you can choose to absolutely go ham by taking 5 courses per semester and making them all STEM (math, cs etc). doing this + research will give you better chances at top grad schools.\n\nbiggest stress differentiators for me at brown are:\n- harder classes are often mandatory pass/fail\n- any fail is removed from your transcript\n- grade inflation\n- noncompetitive environment where people aren\u2019t pigeonholed into one major and a bunch of required classes and normally have interests outside of cs\n- exploring classes outside of your major is normalized, encouraged and enabled by the pass/fail system. e.g many student course-loads look like: one hard cs course (letter grade), one \u201cokay\u201d cs course (letter-grade), one \u201cother interest/minor\u201d course (pass/fail or letter grade) and one \u201cfun\u201d course for pass/fail.\n\nas always, balance is key. you want to learn but also not burn out and, from personal experience, you can really dial it in. this semester, for example, i was overzealous with my course-load and decided to take 5 courses instead of usual 4. dropping a course was as easy as clicking a button and i did it midway thru semester. no effect on transcript.\n\nlet me know if you have more questions and congrats on brown!",

If you\u2019re any good, you\u2019ll get a good internship somewhere, and you\u2019ll get a job. Or, stick around for another year and get a masters! \n\nYou got all the time in the world in college. \n\nJust wake up before noon and do your work during the day and suddenly, every evening is an evening that can be spent with friends getting up to absolutely no good\u2014except for deadline days, but in most CS classes that\u2019ll only be every coupla weeks anyway. \n\nYou got this.",

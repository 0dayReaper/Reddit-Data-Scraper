There\u2019s some premed advising iirc to help you figure out courses that might be good to take in order to go to med school after brown!",

            "comment": "I\u2019ll just emphasize that the concentrations you selected on common app have 0 bearing on anything; they supposedly try to group kids with a certain intended concentration together for first year advising\u2026 half the folks i talked to had mostly others of the same intended concentration\u2026 the other half (including myself) had a bunch of random ass people and a random ass advisor.\n\nConcentration declaration is not discussed until your 4th semester. Pre-med programs are fairly standardized (I know only a bit about this b/c of friends\u2026 I study math and have little interest in medicine), so you should talk to premed advising and read about this online. In particular, there is a set of courses you are required to take (some spread of first and second semester courses in, like, physics, chem, obviously bio, etc).\n\nMost individual concentrations at brown are pretty light. If you are as excited as it seems, I think you\u2019ll have no trouble motivating yourself to sit down and read about all of these specialties. Just some Wikipedia/ online forum trawl. I think any of the concentrations intersecting applied math, biology, CS, and chem are very interesting and promising areas even outside of med school considerations.\n\nLastly, I\u2019ve heard there is something to being \u201cdemonstrably human\u201d and not just packing STEM on STEM on STEM for med school admissions \u2014 a friend at Rice minored(?) in religious studies almost strictly for this reason. Would say it\u2019s worth having that in mind + give yourself some time to rest. While the grading scheme at Brown is kind, you still need a killer GPA.",

            "comment": "I was a Slavic Studies major and am going to med school in August- your major really, truly does not matter for med school. As other people said, you don't have to declare until Sophomore spring; just start working your way through the premed prereqs in your first year. You could easily do environmental science and be premed (and I'd also recommend looking into the Health &amp; Human Bio concentration, which iirc might let you mix ENVS and the premed prereqs hella easily). I think Health Careers Advising publishes a list of the prereqs online somewhere if you want to go look at them.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you want to chat about being premed at Brown!",

            "comment": "The neighborhood just north of campus often has available street parking, but you have to look for it, and the residents might not like you too much. Probably a good idea to look for spots in different places each time at the very least. That will entail budgeting more time than you think. On the occasions when I drove to campus to save time, I often found that finding parking erased all my savings. The last time I tried I gave up, drove back home, and walked.\n\nWhatever you do, don\u2019t leave your vehicle overnight because the entire city is under a parking ordinance. You absolutely will get a ticket unless you have a city parking pass for the precinct you\u2019re parked in. \n\nI don\u2019t know your situation, but if there is another way for you to get there (train, bus, etc) you might consider it, both for your sake and others\u2019. Parking near Brown is always tricky. The campus is right in the middle of ordinary neighborhoods. The people who live there are generally kind and tolerant, but they understandably don\u2019t want Brown business invading their lives every minute of every day. Treat the good people of Providence courteously and they will return the favor. That probably means not parking an unknown car in front of their house on a regular basis.",

Need a spot to house the car for a few hour before rolling home. The school only has garage space outside of College Hill, not ideal. Maybe a car/e-scooter comb is my best option?",

Maybe contact the university directly and explain your unique circumstances. They might be able to help you figure something out. For instance, the garage at Brook and Power is for employees but it\u2019s usually not full. Maybe you can persuade someone to cut you a fair deal on a spot there. It\u2019s worth a shot.",

If you want to be closer to campus, you can also check on the Brown buying and selling facebook group to see if anyone is renting a parking spot. A lot of students who live in Fox Point live in apartment buildings with parking spaces but don't use them so they rent them out",

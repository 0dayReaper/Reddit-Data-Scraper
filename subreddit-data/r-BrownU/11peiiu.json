    "postText": "Hi! I'm currently taking CS200 and I'm a potential CS concentrator planning to take 2 CS classes next term. Is there any recommendation for the classes to take or any recourse for people to figure out which track they are most interested in? I was gonna try 220 and machine learning (I have taken linear algebra and 1650) but neither will be offered in fall 23. I saw AI / DL on the cab but I heard ML has lighter course workload and better course design, is that true? The other two classes (outside cs) I plan to take will be heavy humanities seminars. Thanks so much for the wonderful suggestions and hope you all have a great day :)",

It\u2019ll give you a lot more insight into things glossed over in 200 if you are curious about what memory *really* is and what it looks like in a computer, and why that matters.\n\nIt is a difficult course though!  But don\u2019t be discouraged by difficult courses.  You can definitely handle it with 220\u2014 I\u2019m not sure about your other courses though.  It would help if you said what they were.  In general if they are weekly PSET type courses or equivalent, I think you should be okay.",

I\u2019m also doing an AB in humanities so the other two will be heavy writing and reading seminars :) \n\nI\u2019m really not sure about which track to take (perhaps AI, system, design, or software? Haha I have no clue). Do you have any recommendations to pair up with 330 - currently ux/ui seems quite interesting!",

It's like a math class, but without motivation, and a half baked coding portion. Professor Bach is ok, but nothing special. I wouldn't go to class if he didn't take attendance with top hat. I agree with another comment, you should take 330 or 300 asap. 320 is kind of mid, but you learn a fair amount if you want to learn. If you like your systems class, you can take more upper level systems courses such as operating systems. Maybe also consider a cryptography course if you like math.",

I\u2019ll also definitely see how the systems class goes!",

    "postText": "When you were in secondary school (elementary, middle, high school) did you play video games as a hobby/activity while you were studying to get into Brown? If yes, how much time were you spending, how could you control the time you spend playing video games, did it have any effect on you, and would you recommend it? If no please still comment because I wish to hear as many people\u2019s opinions as possible.",

            "comment": "Games certainly work.\n\nhttps://thetab.com/us/brown/2017/08/22/brown-freshman-gets-accepted-with-essays-about-video-games-3919\n\nhttps://youtu.be/vWEKTDam1To\n\nThis was me, a freshly admitted student to Brown! \n\nI should caution you that when we talk about \u201cgames\u201d here, I actually specifically mean \u201ccompetitive games,\u201d or \u201cesports.\u201d The reason is that, playing Skyrim by yourself for 10 hours a day after school while neglecting studies IS NOT the same as competing in League of Legends and trying to be top 1% in the world. You could make the same argument for anything; watching random football shit all day vs preparing to be the best player you can be are two very different things. \n\nAnyway, I wrote my essays for Brown about gaming. In particular, for \u201cwhy Brown,\u201d I said basically \u201cbecause Brown Esports.\u201d It worked, and I graduated this past spring! \n\nI would say that in high school, you have to be disciplined, very hard. Like, it would be extremely easy to do no work and engage with a hobby (or nothing) after the bell rings. The trick is finding the balance that works right for you. For me, this was (1) taking a nap immediately after getting home, (2) playing games till like 10 or something, (3) doing homework till I had to sleep. One of my strategies was doing work **while at school,** perhaps at the detriment of my learning in other classes. Basically, the second I understood something, I clocked out and did other work. This let me fuck around and maximize the time for (2) above. \n\nFurthermore, the time I spent gaming was (1) entirely social, and (2) entirely competitive. I pretty much only played games with other people and only played competitive games, save for the random casual game here and there. I played competitive Call of Duty for a while, transitioned to League of Legends, and then started to learn Super Smash Bros. Melee. I also exclusively played these games with friends, and used them as a means to meet new people. I was able to learn A LOT and develop my skills through watching others. \n\nThe reality is that saying \u201coh yeah I play games \u2014 I\u2019m always grinding Animal Crossing every day by myself!!!\u201d probably isn\u2019t enough to convince an admissions officer that you\u2019re going to offer something to Brown by being admitted. I\u2019m sure you CAN spin playing games by yourself as something valuable and important, however it\u2019s much easier with esports or other forms of social gaming (e.g., streaming). Talking about esports showed I could form communities, I could lead them, how I demonstrated the ability to learn and improve at a hobby, and how I proved that it was hard to do it. \n\nGaming and being social through gaming made me who I am today. I am unabashedly nerdy, and it\u2019s fun to be that way \u2014 being proud of your hobbies is fun. I met hundreds of people, many of whom are my closest friends; many closer than anyone I know in person. It allowed me to develop my ability to speak publicly and to approach strangers with ease (between streaming and public lobbies), and I managed to overcome any fears of interacting with others. \n\nThat being said, every single hobby can be abused. As I said, if you\u2019re neglecting your studies and playing games INSTEAD OF doing work, not playing games along with doing work, then you\u2019re going to have trouble. I had straight A\u2019s through high school, and I know for a fact that if I dropped any of those down to a B, my parents would have never let me play as much as I did. You need to have the discipline to make sure your shit\u2019s getting done. I didn\u2019t (and still don\u2019t), have the discipline to do work in a timely fashion though, so my sacrifice is that I just sleep less :p. I averaged like 4-5 hours of sleep in high school for four years. If you manage your time better, it\u2019s certainly possible to not be sleep deprived \u2014 I\u2019m just an ultra procrastinator. I would have been done it with any hobby, so this is in no way a problem with gaming specifically. \n\nHope this helps elucidate some stuff. Good luck!",

            "comment": "I'm a current freshman at brown, and I was a competitive Pokemon VGC player throughout middle school and high school. I was mostly homeschooled in middle school, only being involved in my school district for math competitions, and spent more time playing Pokemon than doing school. In high school, I stopped being homeschooled but continued competing seriously. I missed around half of my freshman year and a month or two of sophomore year because I was always travelling internationally for events. During those two years I was spending \\~20 hours a week playing Pokemon. I was able to balance it with my class schedule due to good relationships with my teachers and the fact that I didn't find my school work too overwhelming. However, I cut back significantly junior and senior year when I was taking 8 APs / studying for ACT / writing essays. I played only a few hours a week (mostly on weekends), and started spectating more events than I competed in. However, I would still miss a few days of school each month to travel to an event, even if just to see my friends who remained more active in competing.\n\nSo it's definitely possible, but you have to be very clear about what your life goals are and stick to those rigorously. I was comfortable cutting back later in high school because I had achieved what I wanted in VGC, and became genuinely more interested in other things such as robotics.\n\nIn general, I think the mentality of \"I can't do X because it won't be good for college\" or \"I should do X because it will be good for college\" is quite toxic. I wrote multiple essays for Brown about the different aspects of my time playing VGC, and I don't think I would've been a fitting applicant without what I learned from it.\n\nJust do whatever you find fulfilling. Yes, getting good grades is basically mandatory for schools like Brown, but that won't take up all of your time. It's up to you what you do with the rest. I genuinely believe admissions offices much prefer to see people excel in what they are passionate in rather than see the 1000th essay about how much debate/orchestra/whatever other EC people do because \"it looks good\" changed your life.",

I\u2019d skip doing homework and studying because I\u2019d rather play league. Sometimes, I\u2019d even wake up at 5 am to do math homework because I spent the previous night playing league. I gradually stopped playing as I got into hs because I was too busy with my activities and sports. Now, I still play league and valorant from time to time.

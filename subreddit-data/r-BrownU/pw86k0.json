    "postText": "**Note this tutoring is free and on a volunteer basis.**\n\nI graduated from Brown in Math/CS in the class of 2019 and went into software. I've found myself nostalgic for these subjects and have taken to virtual tutoring on a volunteer basis via discord and livestream. I currently help a large group of calc students from another university, and I wanted to see if any students from my alma mater were interested.\n\nI'm reaching out via this subreddit because all my friends have graduated at this point and I don't know any current students. I would welcome any ideas on how to connect to current Brown students (or ideally groups of students taking the same course).\n\nI'd be happy to help with intro-intermediate math/physics/ CS theory/maybe chemistry. I have to imagine there's some premeds/eng underclassmen who would like help with their coursework, and ideally I'd like to get a couple of students who are taking the same class so that tutoring can benefit most people, but individuals are also welcome. I'm online in the afternoons/evenings EST.\n\n[https://discord.gg/TDg5xA9Z](https://discord.gg/TDg5xA9Z)\n\n[https://www.twitch.tv/vtutorlive](https://www.twitch.tv/vtutorlive)\n\nNote to the mods: I hope there's no issues with this post. If for some reason you'd like to verify my email address to prove this post is Brown-related, I'd be happy to do so via a private message.",

Idk if it was always like this, but Dear Blueno appears to only update once per day, and it does a massive dump of all the messages. I think the free tutoring post got lost in the jumble. Any chance you know of any other facebook pages/groups that might be frequented by current students?",

It was our only entertainment during the pandemic haha \n\nAnother option would be to post of the class Facebook pages, but it means you would need someone in each of the groups to post for you. \n\nMy other thought would be to email the professors of classes you\u2019re interested in tutoring directly and see if they\u2019ll advertise to their classes.",

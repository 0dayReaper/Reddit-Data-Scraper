    "postText": "I'm thinking of taking 1200 this semester and wanted to know how hard it was and how worthwhile it is. APMA 1655 would be a good comparison point. Particularly, is it important if looking into quant trading? Or am I better off with other apma classes like 1740 or machine learning.",

Are you saying 1740 and ML will also help me get better at the probability brain teasers? Because I think that's pretty much the only thing quant interviews ask?",

I am a senior who just finished an internship in quant trading and will be working as one for full time as well and found that APMA 1200 was excellent preparation for the interview process.",

Can I keep all my textbooks on the ipad and do my homework assignments on there? I feel like it'd be nice to have everything in one device.\n\nAlso, for you ipad users, any app recommendations for note-taking and staying organized?",

I find that I learn better/take better notes on paper than on any sort of device, personally, but that's absolutely not true of everyone.\n\nETA: I rarely carried my textbooks with me in college, except if I was going to study somewhere. *Very* rarely for classes, and when I did that was more for literature or philosophy classes.",

You can keep your books in there, have your handwritten notes turned into text automatically (there\u2019s some room for error here)\u2026\n\nI use good notes for note taking because personally I like it more than notability, but they are both good apps for note taking.",

Textbooks, I keep in PDF form for the most part. \n\nSo I guess that's an alternative if you're not big on apple stuff. Being a full computer, you can also run whatever weird program a class might need as well.",

            "comment": "So having a car on campus is kinda a pain because Brown makes it difficult for non-commuter students to obtain parking permits. The best way to find parking is through private landlords on college hill and it costs anywhere from $100-200 per month for a spot. I\u2019ve had my car on campus for over a year because of work and it was difficult at the start to figure out everything thing. However, having a car on campus does make life a lot easier if you find yourself leaving college hill quite often.",

The one caveat is that you must provide proof of residency in Providence when you apply for the permit and certain housing arrangements (e.g. dorms and some apartment complexes) are ineligible for the permit.\n\nOtherwise, you can do what I did which was test the waters with Brown and Providence parking enforcement and getting $200 in tickets ;-;",

Join an investment club like BIG or SRIF as well as a consulting club like BCC or CCG and get some guidance regarding recruiting materials from upperclassmen. I would recommend reading through those materials / talking to alumni as soon as possible because it can help you determine which field you want to go into / think through what industries or groups you want to focus on. Also, I would consider other roles too like private equity and hedge funds as there are a few graduates these days going into those fields straight out of Brown. I can\u2019t speak to UMichigan, but I felt very supported by alumni and current students during my interview process for IB. Now that I\u2019m looking for a new role, I\u2019m also finding alumni or random connections from alumni (eg. alumni co-workers, siblings, etc.) extremely helpful, so the Brown network continues. Speaking to headhunters (brokers for finance jobs post-grad) it seems like Brown has a decent name that is especially good for smaller shops. I agree maybe not the best for mega funds as another commenter said.",

Better than every other school. Source: Placement info and straight from a Bain recruiter.\n\nFor Banking-- More of a mixed bag. There isn't great recruiting infrastructure here and you have to exercise your agency in getting internships and into clubs. However if you are prepared (and the fact you know what IB is as a high schooler suggests you are), Brown is again a top school to attend.I think only HYPSW outclass Brown and Columbia/UChicago/Dartmouth slightly edge Brown. Brown is roughly on par with Duke, MIT, and Cornell. UMich is like two tiers below Brown - great school, but the name is not as well respected for banking and beyond\n\nFor Entrepreneurship - This is all you. The Nelson is still relatively new, and having Brown doesn't really matter if you don't have the stomach to pursue your own thing. Will say that the Brown name and people you interact with outclasses Michigan moreso than simple MBB/IB recruiting",

From your logic, Michigan is preferable to Harvard and Indiana is preferable to Stanford. Let\u2019s not mistake placement data for opportunity to place.\n\nThe numbers you shared are on an absolute basis. Brown has a MUCH smaller contingent recruiting for these jobs both because of a relatively smaller undergrad and a lack of student interest. For those who do choose to pursue these fields, they wind up being very successful and place in more \u201cprestigious\u201d places than those at Michigan, etc. Also I don\u2019t even know if these numbers are right. Someone I worked on a startup with is in the McKinsey New York group chat for the class of 2022 and it has 15 people. Your data says 20 in all offices over 8 years\u2026 The chart you shared is way off, I wouldn\u2019t trust it. \n\nInstead of misleading numbers, I suggest you use common sense. Brown is more prestigious and difficult to get into than every non-ivy plus school. Its students are likewise perceived better by employers. Multiple people in this thread have shared firsthand accounts of the campus recruiting benefits at these schools. Anecdotally if you work hard you will get a great job. I did it. And all of my friends recruiting did as well. Conversely I have friends at these large feeder schools and standing out there is even harder. Great schools, nonetheless.",

Your \u201ccommon sense assumption\u201d that Brown is more prestigious so it places better isn\u2019t backed by data and your anecdote from your buddy doesn\u2019t trump a published analysis that looked at over 3k people in consulting and where they went to school. Do you find it hard to believe Harvard, Penn, Mich, Yale, Stanford, Duke, Princeton, and MIT were the top 8 for consulting? I\u2019ll willingly concede UMich is the least prestigious of those but Harvard, Penn, Yale, Stanford, Duke, Princeton, and MIT are pretty much the 7 best for top undergrad business-related opportunities, so their list makes sense.",

That\u2019s well over three times as much the # of people recruiting for those jobs at Brown (30-50 IB, 80-90 consulting). Lots of non-Ross students (bio and stem majors) go for consulting too so 400 is much smaller actually.

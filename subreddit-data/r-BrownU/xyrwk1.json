I really liked the campus and area but am scared I am going to get too homesick and apply to Pton instead. If you can give any advice or how you feel like you\u2019re experience has been I would appreciate it. :)",

            "comment": "Here are some of my pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n\nOpen Curriculum. Definitely my favorite part of brown. Getting to take a class just because it looks interesting and not stressing about getting perfect straight A's was so nice compared to other schools. Even the required classes for your particular concentration allow some room to choose a class that appeals to you most, so that flexibility is definitely great!\n\nOpportunity to get involved in research. Getting into a research project at Brown was probably one of the easiest experiences I've had because so many professors are looking for students to help with their work! Of course it'll depend on your department, but I took classes in many different subjects and all of them had some sort of ongoing projects for you to join! There are also a ton of resources and faculty that are dedicated entirely to helping students get into research and can help you create networks\n\nCons:\n\nThe actual campus: a lot of the facilities feel so dated, especially the dorms. The first-year dorms were almost universally bad outside of one when I was a freshman, but I've heard that some have been updated recently. Winter is also pretty rough because of how fucking poorly the sidewalks are shoveled. Ice slicks all over the main walkways were miserable to walk around and if you ever have to go down the hill to the school of public health, just take the bus.\n\nDisparity in quality of professors. Most of the professors I've had have been pretty great, but I'm sure everyone here has had one that's awful. What bother me most was that it seemed like the worst professors always had the intro class that's required for your concentration or more advanced classes. The most infamous one I can think of was for an intro stats class called APMA 1650 where it seemed like every year they had someone teaching it that was unnecessarily harsh and unorganized. Again it all depends on your department, but I've enjoyed almost all of my professors.\n\nMixed:\n\nSmall class sizes. I REALLY loved small sections and getting to have great discussions. Last semester I had a class with only 5 people in it and absolutely enjoyed just having discussions without having people talk over you or worry about trying to get participation points. However, the small sizes are actually kinda detrimental for some departments like English. A lot of the required courses for some concentrations are limited to 20 students and registration goes to who's fastest on the trigger, so some students struggle to get their requirements in before senior year (seniors get priority in class registration). Totally depends on the department but overall I enjoyed the smaller sizes.\n\nI hope this helps and good luck with your applications!",

                            "comment": "There's tons of clubs to choose from! There's the usual clubs like dance club, debate, etc., each department also has a \"club\" called the DUG that you can get involved in, lots of cultural clubs, and then some really niche ones like bird watching! Most clubs are open to anyone, but some of them have applications (although these clubs are usually for the tryhard stuff like consulting). \n\nAs for housing, it's pretty much a lottery every year. You're automatically assigned housing as a first year and then after that you enter a lottery either solo or with a group of friends. Your group is given a number which determines how early in the housing process you get to choose your own dorm. The only exception to this is off-campus housing and special assignments like sub-free and quiet housing.\n\nThe dorms really vary in quality. I was in Keeney for my first year, so we had shared bathrooms between maybe 40 students. Almost all doubles, some triples. Some dorms, like New Pembroke, are smaller and have shared bathrooms for maybe a dozen or so people, often having more single rooms. Other dorms like grad center are suites, so 5 people share a bathroom and have their own separate little wing of the dorm. The best housing is definitely the newer ones (I think there was a new dorm called wellness? Supposedly extremely nice!). Overall they are all fine for a dorm, but the older ones certainly feel dated",

Does it have one of those communal showers with no privacy?\n\nAnd as one final question, what's the general vibe on campus? Thank you so much for your time!",

The libraries were great for group projects or if you have a roommate that is a little noisy! \n\nI thought the privacy in the bathrooms was pretty good. In Keeney we had a bathroom with 3 stalls, and then there were 3 showers each with their own curtain. The shower was a little cramped but no one ever walked in on me.\n\nAs for the general vibe, it was definitely more relaxed than anything else! I hate a competitive environment and I rarely got that feeling. Lots of people encourage working together so the vibe was mostly friendly! I hope this helps but I'm happy to answer any more questions!",

They help you pick classes so you don't have any schedule conflicts, but that was pretty much it. The advisor you get after you declare your major (done in sophomore year I think?) is so much more useful. They really helped me with research and are super helpful in post-graduation plans be it further education or helping to find a job/internship",

Therefore, I respect anyone who is willing to subject themselves to the mental and physical stressors of being an athlete all while juggling academics on the side. It warms my heart watching them eat together and support each other through problems as if they were family.\n\nIt\u2019s fun to joke about their stereotypes every once in a while (I dressed up as an athlete on Halloween), but at the end of the day, they\u2019re bright people who definitely add value to the university in my opinion.",

They quite often work just as hard and put the same amount of time and dedication at their crafts to be just as good.  The difference?  As always, like it or not, follow the money trail. Athletes often bring in steady money, if not always loads of money.  That's why they are valued at and from these schools. \n\nThey aren't the only people that work hard...far from it.",

(the actual numbers of folks who apply every year and don't get into BOTH brown and risd - they only get into one, or neither - is obviously much higher than 800-900. there aren't even numbers for the actual acceptance rate but it's probably somewhere around 1-2% acceptance.)",

About 55 students are accepted to both schools. So while yes, the acceptance rate is about 2%, this includes the vast majority of students who are rejected from one or both schools but indicated on their common app that they were applying to the program.",

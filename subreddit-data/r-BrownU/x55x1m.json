He\u2019s a Duboisian sociogist tho so his main focus of research is on WEB DuBois which isn\u2019t bad reading so long as you take ur time to understand the topic",

He explains the readings (at least for my class, he always posted contextual videos that made the readings more feasible) and is very gracious in office hours if you\u2019re having an issue. He also really tries to make discussions exciting and interactive, plus the writings and projects are manageable and if he\u2019s grading, he tends to be considerate rather than nit picky.",

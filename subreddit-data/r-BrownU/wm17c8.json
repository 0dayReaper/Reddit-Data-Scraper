What were your expectations coming into brown in regards to the people and how were they met/not met? Are people actually nice? Thanks!",

            "comment": "Hi, speaking as a nostalgic 2021 alum doomscrolling Reddit at 2 am: yes, with some caveats. \n\nJust like any other college, there are nice people and not-so-nice people. You will likely take some time to find the right combination of nice people whom you enjoy spending time with. While this happens instantly for some people, it was not the case for me and for some others I know. I was initially disappointed when I got to Brown because I assumed it would be easy to make friends - this COULD be true if you\u2019re an extrovert, or lucky, or some combination thereof- but I was very introverted and socially anxious at the time, so the first few months were pretty hard on me as I watched other people make friends relatively easily. Nonetheless, no one was ever deliberately mean to me - and I had a great group of people take me under their wings pretty soon (although I left Brown with my closest friends being a completely different group of people, and this is a very common college experience).  \n\nI\u2019m lucky to say I never had a close brush with a really unpleasant person at Brown but I\u2019ve known quite a few of them through friends/ friends of friends. Then there are those people who are perfectly great, but just not for me. So it really depends on your personality, preferences and circumstances! 90% of the people I met were lovely, kind and just wonderful souls all around. \n\nThat other 10% is just reality creeping in - but I will say that this number is a lot lower than I would estimate it at other Ivies/good schools, which my high school friends went to/ I visited. Brown is truly a bubble in that sense- a lot of my classes were spent collaborating with people, making new friends, teaching  and learning from others. My understanding is that this learning environment is pretty unique compared to other  good schools, which usually lean towards a more competitive atmosphere. This might have to do with the self-selecting process of more learning-by-collaboration-driven students choosing to go to Brown, which has a lower emphasis on grades (check out the S/NC / no GPA policies) than on learning, and learning together. \n\nAnyway, this is a long way of saying - people at Brown do tend be on the nicer side, but manage your expectations coming in so you can transition smoothly to college life (no matter where you go). However, this is just my opinion and I did have relatively smooth sailing (minus COVID years) at Brown - so take it with a pinch of salt!",

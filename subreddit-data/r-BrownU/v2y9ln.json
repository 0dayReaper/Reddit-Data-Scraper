    "postText": "I'm interested in an APMA concentration but I'm stuck choosing between MATH  0520 or 0540. For context, I have taken a proof based linear algebra course before, but I don't feel like I grasped the material that well. From the most recent surveys on The Critical Review, it seems like 0540 has better teachers, but I'm also not sure how reliable this is because do different professors teach it each year? I'm leaning toward 0540 because I have some background with it, but I'm worried that if I take 0540 I won't get much practice with application and solving problems. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would greatly appreciate any insight into either course (difficulty, time commitment, usefulness for later courses, etc.). Thank you!",

            "comment": "I took 540 and it was the best decision, made me go from apma cs to pure math cs.  520 is a lot of computation.  You can get that experience anywhere from any free online resources\u2014 just practice practice practice.  What you cant get anywhere is access to a construction of linear algebra from the ground up.  One of the professors in the rotation wrote \u201cLinear Algebra Done Wrong\u201d which is one of the destination textbooks for these kinds of courses.\n\nThe time commitment was very managable\u2014 it was just reading the textbook and doing exercises and the weekly homework.  Maybe 10 hrs per week on average (homeworks could get long)\n\nIt is difficult BUT imo plenty worth it",

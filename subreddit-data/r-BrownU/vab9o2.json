This is a rote memorization course so you\u2019ll probably be cramming a lot for exams, but it\u2019s easier to cram if you\u2019ve seen the content before. \n\nAs another commenter mentioned, go to office hours. The more questions you ask the more likely you are to memorize the information and to find gaps in your knowledge. \n\nFocus on the slides, and use the textbook to supplement the slides when something is confusing you. \n\nBefore exams, I liked to rewatch every lecture and review their slides while taking notes again. Then I would try to rewrite the notes from memory. Rinse and repeat. \n\nMake tables or charts to organize core concepts. These may be compare and contrasting two things, listing out cell types, or flow charts that show how a process occurs. Anything you can put into a table or chart should be a top priority. \n\nShe\u2019ll likely publish some practice questions, so do those problems. \n\nSome people found Flashcards to be helpful. I\u2019m personally not a big fan of Flashcards, but if they work for you, then make Flashcards for every lecture. \n\nIf you\u2019re bad at memorization like I am, you may need to commit extra hours to studying. Use the weeks before the exams to develop a general understanding of lecture content. Use the days before the exam to commit specific details to memory (the prof loves to test on minute details). If you do all of this, you\u2019ll do fine in the course",

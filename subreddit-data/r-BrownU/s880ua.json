    "postText": "Heyo everyone, I recently made it into Brown through Early Decision and was wondering whether anyone had any advice for what I should pick up tech-wise to hopefully last me through all 4 years. I'm looking to concentrate in CS and love gaming so I'm half expecting to get something more expensive but if anyone has any suggestions.\n\nIf CS students have advice that would probably be most useful to figure out what I should be expecting in terms of what I'd need but there's a lot I could get from basically anyone I'd imagine. What laptop might be worth investing in? Does getting a Windows or MacOS desktop matter?\n\nReally if anyone's got any advice it'd be much appreciated :))",

I\u2019ve heard good things from my brother about his asus zephyrus (I think with the ryzen 9 in it) but those seem to be quite a bit harder to get a hold of",

            "comment": "in terms of classes what computer you pick up doesn't matter since you can do all your work on a department machine (what I did). In terms of gaming you're better off picking up a windows desktop but mobility matters a lot so if you don't already have a laptop I recommend picking up one (windows for gaming). MacOS is great and reliable for development but wouldn't recommend it for gaming at all.",

            "comment": "Most of my friends in CS have Windows, but across campus I think IT says it's a 2/3 1/3 split between Mac and Windows. If you do end up getting a Mac, I highly recommend getting a pro with 256 GB or above -- I have an Intel Air (not sure about the M1 ones) and it struggles the minute I open Zoom or try to watch lectures. Would recommend getting an iPad for notes if you plan to take a lot of classes outside of CS, it can be really helpful.  \n\n\nGetting a monitor is helpful too, I got mine for \\~$100 from Costco and while it's nothing fancy, it does the job.",

            "comment": "if you're comfortable using mac, i would recommend any of the recent macbooks. the M1 chips simply are unparalleled in terms of their balance of power and efficiency, which means you won't be hunting for outlets when you're doing work away from your room! unless you are expecting to do some graphics-heavy workloads, i think either the 13 inch macbook air or the 13 inch macbook pro would be a good choice for you. if you think you'll be doing a lot of rendering or simulations OR just want the latest and greatest mac machines and have the budget for them, then perhaps you may want to consider looking into the 14 or 16 inch macbook pros.\n\nthat being said, you probably won't have much luck on the gaming front if you're a PC gamer, unless you already have an existing gaming machine, (which is the route i took when i was a brown undergrad)",

            "comment": "Congratulations on your acceptance! The other commenters have left some wonderful resources, but I would add some classes MAY stipulate a windows os, usually in cs/info sci, but you can usually navigate around this by using a virtual os emulator on a Mac. \n\nFor Windows if you\u2019re on a budget, I would recommend perusing eBay for lightly used thinkpads. You can get a really great machine with high quality materials for very cheap, oftentimes at a multi three figure discount, however, I can\u2019t praise the quality and creature comforts of mac enough. A Mac will last you a very long time if you properly take care of it, but the same goes for a good quality windows. And I should note Macs are not ideal for gaming, you can run indie games that are not very resource-intensive and whatnot, but for anything beyond Minecraft, they don\u2019t fare well.",

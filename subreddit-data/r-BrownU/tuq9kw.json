    "postText": "Hi! I'm an international student who just recently got accepted to Brown (I couldn't be happier!!). I have a difficult decision to make however because I also got accepted to Dartmouth.\n\nAny advice over which one to choose would be greatly appreciated. It can be anything from pros/cons to academics to social life to dorms etc etc  :) \n\nI want to concentrate in Political Science / International Relations, and also specialise in languages.\n\nThank you!!",

            "comment": "They're two very different schools, obviously I'm biased towards Brown if they're similar costs but here's why:\n\n* Brown recently expanded the Watson Institute building (home of the new International and Public Affairs concentration) which is absolutely gorgeous (the old building is really nice inside too)\n* Open Curriculum makes it really easy to take electives/double concentrate etc. especially in language, since it's not a requirement you tend to have people taking them because they want to vs. have to\n* There's just more to do in Providence than Hanover -- even though Providence is on the smaller side, being the largest city in the state means we have most stuff a large city would have and it's an hour train ride to Boston (weekend pass is $10)\n   * College Hill neighborhood is basically a residential suburban place -- Thayer's probably the busiest area, but for the most part I feel relatively safe walking around campus + we have OnCall/Brown shuttles/SafeWalk\n* Dorms and food are decent, but not great -- though from what I've heard most of the Ivies have that issue\n* Heard really good things about the International Mentoring Program ([https://www.brown.edu/globalbrowncenter/incoming-students/undergraduate-students/about-international-mentoring-program-imp](https://www.brown.edu/globalbrowncenter/incoming-students/undergraduate-students/about-international-mentoring-program-imp)) and Global Brown Center ([https://www.brown.edu/globalbrowncenter/](https://www.brown.edu/globalbrowncenter/))\n* While we're larger than Dartmouth, we're still definitely smaller than most other non-LAC schools -- and honestly the size is nice because you're always meeting new people",

            "comment": "I love Brown, but Dartmouth\u2019s political science and undergraduate teaching are unparalleled. They have the most members in the history of Congress behind Harvard and Yale of the Ivys despite being the smallest school.\n\nHowever, Brown is also strong, so I\u2019d say you should completely decide based off non-academic criteria. If you come from a better-off background, are into brother/sister-hoods, and a smaller and tighter community, maybe you\u2019re a better fit for Dartmouth. However, Brown has more liberal people, the open curriculum, and dorm gathering rather than frats.\n\nIf you want to explore more, I\u2019d choose Brown. From Brown, you can get to Boston on a train for like $10. Dartmouth is way farther from Boston (closest major city)",

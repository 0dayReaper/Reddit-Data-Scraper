They can put you in touch with faculty and (assuming things haven't changed) a student in the Ph.D. program you're interested in.\n\nYou can also \"cold email\" someone in the program.\n\nTwo questions I wished I asked before entering a Ph.D. program are \"how many Ph.Ds. has the program produced in the last 5 years and where are they working?\"\n\nGood luck.",

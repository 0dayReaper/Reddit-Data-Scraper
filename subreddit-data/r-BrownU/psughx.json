Hopkins' department seemed (predictably enough) focused on \"how do we apply computer science to medicine?\" whereas Brown has several faculty members who study undergrad computer science education...if you aren't into medicine, which do you think is a better choice for an undergrad CS experience?",

Brown ApMa is stacked in computational math/ numerical analysis).\n\nBrown vs Stern was very easy once I realized what exactly IB/ PE world was like. Did not want that life; even if I did go there, I would have been like Stern stats + Computer Science or something like that.\n\nBrown vs GaTech was difficult. More of a personal choice... I was a bit of prestige-whore low key. I always knew that I wanted to just grind out through undergrad, and I knew also that I wouldn't be able to do that at GaTech (personal situations, etc). 35% prestige whore 65% needing to get out of Georgia/ away from certain influences, lest I not accomplish my goals -- there seem to be far more people in the same boat/ interests as me here than at GaTech, so mostly happy with the choice from that perspective. Money was really hard to turn down, but it has provided motivation to really stay on top of my work.",

I had heard about people sabotaging other people\u2019s study sessions and that a lot of people view their classmates as competition and not friends, plus their suicide rate is pretty high. Learning all that made me decide not to apply altogether and so Brown became my top school bc I had visited the campus in a Summer@Brown program and I loved the campus and the environment of the school",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI am a freshman at a university in Boston and was wondering how to participate in research (specifically engineering/physics) at Brown in any way as an out-of-school student. Two summers ago I also did a summers worth of research at USC in the CS department, if that helps.\n\nMore generally, I'm very interested in transferring to Brown for a multitude of reasons, academic and personal, and am looking for any tips or opportunities to make me stand out from the rest of the pool. Any help at all would be greatly appreciated. Obligatory \"im trying my hardest to get a 4.0 this semester.\"",

In general, I think it's going to be very hard for you to get out-of-school research assistant-ships, and I want to say that most Brown prof's will explicitly say they won't entertain working with undergrads from elsewhere during the year/ non-REU sort of project (because of a multitude of logistics issues + they tend to already have to deny a lot of Brown undergrads).\n\nAlmost surely better and easier to find something at your uni in Boston towards this end?",

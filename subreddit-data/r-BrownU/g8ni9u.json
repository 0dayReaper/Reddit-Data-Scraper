            "comment": "I generally agree with her although I believe that revenue loss shouldn\u2019t be a motive for bringing students back. The government should provide relief packages for institutions of higher education (yes even Harvard) so that they have more financial leeway to bring people back on campus and not cause controversy by dipping their hands into PPP.\n\nI\u2019m not so sure about her hotels idea but I don\u2019t see why she just recommends extending off campus housing permission to more students.",

But that\u2019s just how I read into it.",

Or, even worse, I'm worried a bunch of us will get really sick (this thing about people getting blood clots and having strokes is scary).  Zoom University is not what my parents saved every penny for. We're right in the spot just over where people get financial aid because of how much my parents saved. Not to sound spoiled, because I know this is the least of what people are going through with this pandemic, but Zoom University also not what I had pictured for my four years of college. So I know the university is in a financial bind, but frankly, I don't want my family to keep spending money for this, and personally, I'd rather take a year off and try to find something productive to do with it until things hopefully get a little more back to normal. I was wondering if anyone else is thinking the same.",

She articulated a possible path forward to do it safely with concrete suggestions. There obviously has to be some balance. It cannot be that colleges don't open until a vaccine to guarantee no one gets sick as we don't know  if that will ever happen. ...\nThere HAS to be balance and her article prioritized health of students. \nShe said:\nThe reopening of college and university campuses in the fall should be a national priority. Institutions should develop public health plans now that build on three basic elements of controlling the spread of infection: test, trace and separate.\n\nHow is she not prioritizing heath? \nEven with your example there was a balance. If Brown wanted to minimize \"no dead students\" they could aggressively enforce no substances with harsh draconian policies like expulsion. I am NOT advocating that. I am just saying there is always a balance...\n\nI have no problem with your suggestion of a committee. But I think you have mischaracterized the point of her article",

                    "comment": "My concern when reading President Paxson's article was that she began by talking about economics - which doesn't just mean she's only interested in money, I  think she genuinely cares about education and I understand that colleges need to be solid financially to provide that - but it wasn't until the 7th paragraph down that she started talking about health. I certainly think she cares about the health of students as well, she's definitely not heartless,  it's just a question of where the balance for her lies, and I'm a bit worried that she's willing to take too many risks to open the school. I noticed that most Ivies closed before Brown did. I worry that the \"test, trace, separate\" plan won't work until we have reliable tests, which certainly isn't yet.",

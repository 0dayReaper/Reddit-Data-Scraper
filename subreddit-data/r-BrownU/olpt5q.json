The only think I\u2019d like to add or clarify is that the writing designated courses (WRIT) can be found in pretty much any department. There\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll see a class in a non English class you\u2019re interested in and it\u2019ll happen to be WRIT. So don\u2019t stress too much on this point if writing and English aren\u2019t your thing (though you do need two English classes if you want to apply to med school).",

Even with those, as long as you have a general idea of what you want to do, you can take plenty of classes that have nothing to do with your major. I\u2019m majoring in physics, which is pretty high up there in terms of the required courses, and even then about half of my classes are electives",

One more question though, what do you mean by the classes having to meet the prerequisites? You mean like as long as I took the prerequisite classes of the class that I want to take?",

We don't have a \"core\" that forces you to take English classes (though 2 writing-designated classes are required), or take Math, Geography, and PE.\n\nIn theory, it's very flexible. In practice, it really isn't.\n\neg.) I switch from premed to CS my sophomore year. I hadn't taken an intro sequence. I took the accelerated version of the intro sequence and the intermediate course the following semester to get up to speed for interviewing and build the resume. I didn't really have time for electives.",

I was a grad student that napped there as well. \n\nHow long are you looking to nap for?\n\nSimplest option is the basement of the Rock (library), those comfy seats that have the big window in front of them overlooking College Hill (sorta). \n\nSci-Li basement, as others have said. \n\nIf you want and you don\u2019t find it sacrilegious,s second floor (chapel) pews of Manning Hall are pretty nice and the setting is peaceful(?). Also, I never came across anyone up there (a good reading place too for complete quiet). \n\nIn non winter, bring a towel, or something to put on the ground and sleep on the quiet green (as no one is ever over there) under some trees, or by the bell tower, etc. \n\nA lot of classrooms in the original (old buildings) off the main quads (especially the last one that has Marcus Aurelius in it) go basically unused after early afternoon and you can find some carpeted grounds to sleep on and close the blinds; exploring which ones will take some effort on your end, but may be worth the time. \n\nLook around your department building, sometimes there are some gems\u2014unused corners/rooms you can utilize at the right time. I had a committee member that had, basically, three offices. One he never used, and I took some naps in it a couple time \ud83d\ude01. \n\nGood luck.",

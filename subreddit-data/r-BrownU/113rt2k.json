It is named for the year that the printing press was invented \u2014 and the number of minutes in a day.\n\nNumbers charted his early success: After graduating from Brown University in 2020 with a 4.0 grade point average, he was named to the[ Forbes 30 Under 30](https://www.forbes.com/profile/pierre-lipton/?sh=3b1b9b2e2684) list for media in 2022.\n\nNumbers chronicled the speed he achieved in road racing: On Oct. 1, he finished first in the Jamestown Half Marathon in 1 hour, 27 minutes, and 11 seconds.\n\nNumbers also captured the triumph and tragedy of his final day: On Feb. 4, he finished the Mesa (Arizona) Marathon in 3 hours, 10 minutes, and 5 seconds \u2014 maintaining a pace of 7 minutes and 15 seconds per mile for 26.2 miles \u2014 before collapsing and dying.\n\nHe was 26 years old.\n\nThose who loved him say Lipton \u2014 who was born in Charlotte, N.C., and lived in Providence \u2014 made each moment count.\n\n\u201cHe lived life to the fullest in every way,\u201d said his mother, professor Siu Challons-Lipton.\n\n\u201cHe never did anything less than 100 percent,\u201d said his girlfriend, Eleanor Pereboom.\n\nHe had countless plans and dreams.\n\nHe wanted to run all the major marathons. He longed to play for the national soccer team in Tonga, the South Pacific nation where his mother was born.\n\nHe spoke English, Spanish, Arabic, and was learning Italian in anticipation of a trip in May. He liked to build things \u2014 whether with Legos or new business ventures \u2014 and he wanted to make a difference in the world.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile some runners fuel up on IPAs, Lipton stayed away from alcohol and caffeine while training. \u201cHe was healthy,\u201d his father said. \u201cHe took such good care of himself.\u201d\n\nSo Lipton and Pereboom were prepared when they flew out to Arizona to run the Mesa Marathon on Feb. 4. Temperatures ranged between 46 and 69 degrees that day \u2014 pretty good conditions for running.\n\nAt the starting line, he kissed her goodbye. At the finish line, an official photo shows him looking relaxed, gliding with both feet off the ground, sunglasses reflecting the Arizona sun.\n\nPereboom finished less than 15 minutes later \u2014 in a time of 3 hours, 23 minutes, and 56 seconds. She chugged a bottle of water but didn\u2019t see Lipton. After finding her phone, she texted him but received no reply.\n\nPereboom called him, but he didn\u2019t pick up. She figured he was recovering somewhere and not looking at his phone. Then she used a phone tracker app to see where his phone was. \u201cI\u2019m that annoying girlfriend,\u201d she joked.\n\nThe app showed that Lipton was at a hospital. \u201cThat\u2019s when I started to get worried,\u201d she said.\n\nPereboom found race officials beneath a tent and soon learned what had happened. \u201cHe basically fell right into the arms of paramedics,\u201d she said. \u201cThey tried to do CPR. They tried everything. We still don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d\n\nHis father, an emergency medicine specialist, said, \u201cThe working diagnosis is he might have had some sudden electrolyte imbalance that caused arrhythmia.\u201d",

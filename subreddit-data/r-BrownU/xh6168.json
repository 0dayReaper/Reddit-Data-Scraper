But from another post([https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/fp6gpq/cost\\_of\\_ms\\_cs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/fp6gpq/cost_of_ms_cs/)) on this thread, I found out that, a professor mentioned that the cost of attendance is actually 35K$ per year, and the website was actually showing the wrong cost. He also attached a document([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BVR4klDuDBF43LYV5JVETPZIun9MHoR1/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BVR4klDuDBF43LYV5JVETPZIun9MHoR1/view)) showing the tuition fee rolled out by the brown university to be 35K$.  \n\n\nCan someone who is currently a graduate student at Brown in the CS department please confirm or shed some light on this?",

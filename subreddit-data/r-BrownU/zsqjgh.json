I received my aid package and my parents are expected to pay 14K USD. that's not a lot but it's not something we can pay comfortably because of currency exchange rates and the fact that I have 4 siblings. \n\nHow do I appeal my financial aid ? I really really want to go to brown \n\n:\")",

And financial aid for international students is limited. I would like to add that \u201cdemonstrated need\u201d does not mean being able to comfortably pay. Even in the US, paying for college involves financial sacrifices and is generally hard for everyone. Congratulations on getting into Brown!",

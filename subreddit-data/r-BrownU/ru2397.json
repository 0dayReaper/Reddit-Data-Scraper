    "postText": "I was thinking about taking CS30 this Spring because CS33 isn't offered, but on the bulliten fo or CS it seems like there are some requirements that CS33 covers that CS30 doesn't, even though they seem pretty interchangeable. I might be wrong about that, but that's the impression I got from the course descriptions. Would it be better to wait for CS33 or to assume that CS30 can cover any requirements that CS33 covers? Would I be missing out on anything fundamental by not taking CS33?",

Malte is a fantastic professor, and most people who take 30 love it. Also, it satisfies all the same requirements as 33 and some courses just don't update it on CAB :/",

The loot would be hauled out onto the main green, and we'd play Melee outside. \n\nIt was always so dope to play on Friday / Saturday at ~midnight. So many drunk people would swing by, say \"Whoa! Video games outside! I main Kirby,\" and then play a few rounds. \n\nI guess the point of my anecdote is: the power outlets on the lamps aren't just for studying :D",

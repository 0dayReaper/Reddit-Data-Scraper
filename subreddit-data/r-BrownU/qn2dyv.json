    "postText": "Hi everyone. Sophomore here at another uni. I'm wondering if it will be worth it to apply as a transfer to pursue my junior and senior year at brown? I'm pre-med and not really getting the experience that I am looking for at my institution, with high curves and virtually no advising. I want a smaller school experience and have always loved Brown, I love the open curriculum and the small private school environment. I've already taken intro bio and math, but not phys and ochem although I have some AP credit. Is it worth it or too late? I also have research experience at my uni. Would I be starting from nothing and building from scratch is too hard? What about socially here, is it hard to make friends and meet people? My uni is so competitive that no one hardly wants to be in a study group with anyone else.",

You certainly will be able to join study groups, get more advising, and find clubs and other social activities to meet people though. You won\u2019t be starting from nothing in terms of research, your experience and the professors you meet should provide you close to the same chance of getting opportunities. I\u2019d recommend figuring out how many of your courses will count towards requirements. Perhaps email admissions or your intended concentration department to find out",

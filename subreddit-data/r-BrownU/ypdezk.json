I wouldn\u2019t write this off\u2014definitely make sure you explain when you apply. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have a valid excuse (don\u2019t make bad excuses if you don\u2019t have a good one), make damn sure your semester grades are all As in the likely case that you get deferred because of this.\n\nThe only times I\u2019ve heard people get in with lowish grades are 1) disadvantaged demographics or 2) took a break after getting accepted. But even in the latter scenario, 2 Cs would probably get you a strongly worded letter and possible 1st semester academic probation.",

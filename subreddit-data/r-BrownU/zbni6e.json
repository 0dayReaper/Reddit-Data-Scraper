Are there folks here who got in when there was no request for mid term of deferred rejected after the request? I find it hard to believe that brown would make so obvious",

            "comment": "Most people affirmatively submit Q1 grades/a progress report as required by the application. So for those people there is no need for the AO to reach out to request anything. Sounds like some people didn\u2019t follow directions and so the AO is now asking for the required information. For this sub-set of applicants does it mean they are on the fence? Maybe. I could see if someone was clearly in reject pile for other reasons maybe the AO doesn\u2019t bother to follow up and ask for Q1 grades, but that is total speculation.",

And Brown doesn\u2019t always request grades even if you haven\u2019t submitted them (I know around 4 ED applicants this year who didn\u2019t get the request), so I\u2019m guessing if you are definitely rejected, they wouldn\u2019t care about the fulfilment of the requirement.",

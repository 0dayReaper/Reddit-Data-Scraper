            "comment": "hi! i was part of the program from 2019-2020 and it was one of the best things to have happened to me at brown. idk how it will be this year, but when I was in the program we had biweekly cohort meetings (with a lot of food from restaurants around thayer) and we would discuss topics that would challenge us to think about the changing world around us; in addition, I was also learning new things about myself as an individual and as a student. there is definitely a time commitment if you join the program because you are required to attend the cohort meetings.\n\nyou will also have another support system, meeting check-in monthly with one of the two head coordinators. my advisor was really empathetic and made me look forward to our meetings. \n\nto be honest, it was just really nice to be a part of a small community where you share a similar background (first-gen/low income/etc.) because the majority of my friends (and honestly a lot of people at brown) are not first-gen/low income/etc. i honestly felt comfortable with my cohort right away. i really do not think i would have developed more confidence, courage, and resilience without this program. pm me if you have any more questions!",

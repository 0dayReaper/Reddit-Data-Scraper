You might be particularly interested in BEO (Business, Entrepreneurship &amp; Organizations) or MCM (Modern Culture &amp; Media).\n\nKeep in mind you can also declare an 'Independent Concentration' or IC, where you design your own curriculum and pitch it to the College Curriculum Council. I'm a sitting member on the CCC, so feel free to reach out with any more questions!",

The details are linked [here](https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/advising/curricular-resource-center/independent-concentrations/ic-proposal-submission/ic-proposal), where you can also find contact info to set up a meeting with advisors.\n\nYou don't need to declare any concentration until your fourth semester (end of sophomore year), and ICs are only due by the end of your fifth semester. I'd advise taking freshman year to shop around and flesh out your interests before committing to a concentration, especially if it's an IC. Hope this helps!",

I have a last quick question if you don't mind-- I'm mostly confused about how many/what courses are required to fulfill a concentration (for example BEO). Do you happen to know where I can find this info?",

Some of these might be a little outdated in terms of exact course requirements but things like the number of credits remains pretty constant.\n\nu/bengo1023 is unfortunately correct that BEO will no longer be available but hopefully you can look through some of these curricula and find ones that interest you!",

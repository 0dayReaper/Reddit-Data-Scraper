    "postText": "Hey, I'm currently looking at colleges, planning to major in English with a concentration in creative writing and minor in film. My interest in film really revolves around filmmaking, and most college film courses seem to combine some film analysis with actual filmmaking. Brown, however, does not?  \nThe ONLY film related program I can find on the website is called 'Modern Culture and Media', and seems solely focused on film analysis and nothing else.\n\nDoes MCM or any other program at Brown offer the opportunity to work together making student films with your classmates??\n\nThat's what I really want to do.",

            "comment": "There are lots of opportunities for filmmaking at Brown. Brown Motion Pictures is a student group that produces 4-5 student films every semester, and includes a mix of Brown and RISD students on their productions (which have 20-30 students staffing each one, plus actors). There are also lots of independent projects going on that are always looking for staff as well.\n\nMCM does have a tech room where students in MCM courses can check out camera, audio, and lighting gear to shoot their own films. I don't think there's any way you'll find a lack of film-related opportunities at Brown - I'm merely a hobbyist and have had all sorts of opportunities arise.\n\nAlso, look into RISD FAV - they also do a lot of film stuff and you may be able to cross-enroll into RISD courses.\n\n(For transparency, I worked on one BMP film, and I've been a technology director for BMP for 3.5 years now. I also was a DP on an independent student project that was the official selection at six film festivals!)",

            "comment": "I graduated from MCM last year. As others have said, it does have a production component, and I made a short film for my senior thesis using the department\u2019s equipment, as well as working in various crew roles on lots of friend\u2019s shorts, getting to shoot a whole project on 16mm film, etc. However, MCM also involves a lot of theory and tons of reading/writing about media, and it\u2019s not anything like film school in a traditional sense.\n\nI would say the main pro of MCM is the freedom: unlike in a lot of \u201creal\u201d film schools, you\u2019re never assigned roles on a crew, you don\u2019t have to compete to get your project made, and you can basically produce whatever you want at any time. There\u2019s never a shortage of gear. Experimental work is definitely encouraged.\n\nCons are just the other side of the coin: not much departmental structure production-wise and you will have to be self motivated and do a lot of organizing if you want to make short films, because it\u2019s not a required part of the curriculum. Most of the profs are theorists, video artists, experimental filmmakers, or cultural critics. MCM is not pre-professional at all; most people are there to read about and discuss film and art and how they operate in the world, and not so much to start their career in the film industry. It\u2019s not meant to be a hands-on, here\u2019s-how-a-movie-gets-made program like film school. However, if you\u2019re a self starter, you can make it super hands-on yourself, because the lack of structure means no obstacles standing in your way!\n\nBrown Motion Pictures is also amazing.\n\nHappy to answer questions if you have any",

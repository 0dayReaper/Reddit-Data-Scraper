            "comment": "The answer is \"yes\" at virtually every school. Obviously, you'd be hard-pressed to find parties in the expected sense at the military academies or a number of Christian universities. The difference between \"academic schools\" and \"not academic schools\" is that you just won't find many if any doing shit on weekdays/ when they come home from class. Since basically no Greek life, parties take on the form of small to medium house parties + small crews of folks hanging out and bouncing around various events, rather than what you'd expect to see tailgating at larger schools. Most shit at Brown is kept to Friday and Saturday nights, or 85% of any long weekend we have, though many go out of town.\n\nProvidence is \"lively\" but small. You can usually find whatever you're looking for, but Boston beats out PVD in pretty much every category for a number of reasons w/ very obvious explanations. Luckily, it's 40min by train and maybe an hour by car, depending on when you go.",

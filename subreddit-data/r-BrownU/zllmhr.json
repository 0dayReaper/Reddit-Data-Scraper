    "postText": "Basically, I have been having issues with Brown's Financial Aid Department requesting IDOC documents when on the Applicant Portal, it states there is nothing missing. So I did some digging over the weekend and found information about something called the Banner Self-Service Portal, the Banner ID (an internal ID for financial aid applicants, I think), and a Brown ID (only given to admitted students(?) ). \n\nAfter discovering this information, I called Brown to ask about the IDOC documents and the Banner ID and they stated that there were no issues on their side and gave me the Banner ID. Then I called again to ask if I could have my Brown ID to see what would happen, and they gave it to me! My account has been activated and I currently have access to many of Brown's resources, although I haven't actually done anything for fear that I might mess something up and get my application rescinded (it's probably a stupid fear, but I'm very paranoid right now).\n\nOn both instances, I admitted that I was a current applicant, and they still offered the ID information to me. Does this mean that I was admitted? Or does every applicant, accepted or deferred or rejected, have a Brown ID and a Banner ID? Please let me know and thank you!",

            "comment": "Hey there, some ED Applicants do receive a Brown ID when applying for FinAid. I think it has to do with the applicants playing a sport for Brown if accepted so if you're an athlete that might explain it, this is the only exception iirc. Back when I applied I wasn't given one, but then again, I did it RD.",

The situation you're in is odd but there are exceptions from the rule, as I said. Especially for ED and FinAid applicants. I asked around and a friend also got hers before, we concluded it most likely has to do with simplifying the financial aid profile and its no indicator of Brown's decision. She got deferred.",

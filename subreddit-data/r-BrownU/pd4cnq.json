    "postText": "Hey besties,\n\nso like, I really like Brown, and I'm thinking about ED'ing this fall. Although, after reading some older posts on this subreddit im worried that the pure math department is not the \\*greatest\\*. This is an issue bc i think i want to major in pure math. Is it really as bad as everyone says it is? I'm pretty good at self studying math, and i've taken my fair share of intro courses already (calc 1-3, linear algebra, differential equations, abstract algebra), and ill be taking intro discrete math and number theory courses this year. I don't entirely know if i want to do pure math vs. applied math, but im certainly leaning towards pure math atm. Im thinking that even if the pure math department is bad, i'd rather deal with a sub-optimal math teaching experience that i could potentially make up for on my own, than have to drown in distribution requirements at another institution. also,,, this probably won't really affect my decision but would still be helpful knowledge: is it easy to place out of math classes at Brown? I'd rather make up for small gaps in my knowledge on my own than have to retake a bunch of courses.\n\nthanks in advance for all your lovely answers\n\n\\- a very stressed out high school senior",

While it\u2019s true that applied math is better on the whole at brown, the pure math dept is by no means bad. You don\u2019t need to place out of pure math reqs tho, most profs will just let you take the advanced classes you want (flip side is if you fail the class, it\u2019s on you, can\u2019t blame the class)",

I\u2019m not a math major but I did take one class with a prof who teaches pure math and I thought he was really great. Also, friends in that major seem to enjoy their classes and find them very challenging. Departments vary at Brown in terms of quality but all are more than adequate for job placement and grad school acceptance. Most professors will let you into their classes even if you don\u2019t have pre reqs\u2014a simple email works.",

In your case, if you are almost certain you want to concentrate in Pure Math, at least reach out to 1 current math concentrator (2 if possible), with a list of questions you want to get answered. (a) You seem really well prepared, and you'd do well anywhere, (b) Brown is an excellent choice for almost any concentration on offer, but do the ED fully informed (this is true anywhere).",

So I was pretty confident in EDing but randomly hearing that my concentration of choice was \u201cnot great\u201d was a little jarring. I\u2019ll try to find some pure math concentrators to reach out to, but the replies to this post have made me feel good about potentially EDing again.",

Its pretty hit or miss but over the years theres less misses and more hits. This goes for any uni. What makes brown unique is how easy it is to expand from pure math, how easy it is to take graduate courses (you register the same way you would for an undergrad course and any math major will tell you undergrad courses only scratch the surface of math so taking graduate courses is especially worthwhile considering your background) and how great of an option apma is. Basically every university has 1-2 of the 3, but i havent seen any uni do all 3 perks as well as brown has. There are downsides though, research opportunities at brown aren\u2019t as great for example, but they\u2019re much more open to undergrads. This makes it pretty easy to get an reu as a brown student so its not too bad",

This means that you\u2019ll definitely be skipping the intro classes that contribute to part of the issues with the math department (small department required to teach really big classes to lots of non concentrators). The size of the department means that you can develop really strong relationships with faculty and peers. There are research opportunities, teaching assistant spots, and events that you will have a lot of access to. You also may take grad classes at some point, those seem accessible to undergrads and the size of the department and other events seems to contribute to a lot of interaction between undergrads and grad students. Let me know if you have other questions.",

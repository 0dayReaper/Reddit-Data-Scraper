    "postText": "Hi! Sorry if it's a stupid question, but I was fortunate to be placed in the first section of the VISA0100 course after winning the lottery (MW 10-11:50a), and would love to swap it for the  second one (MW 1-2:50p) - is it possible? At the time of indicating my prefered schedule I had no idea about CS0170 (MWF 11-11:50a) which I'd now love to take, and which intersects with the first section of my current VISA course :(",

Try to do it now before school starts as their inboxes get bombarded during shopping period.\n\nOnce you get the green light, to increase your chances, actively look for someone willing to swap with you... use groupchats, fb groups, etc.",

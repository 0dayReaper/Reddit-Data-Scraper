    "postText": "Good evening!   \n\n\nMy name is Kyle Bailey and I'm a Rutgers University graduate. While at Rutgers I developed a bus app, and now I'm proud to announce I am expanding to Brown University!   \n\n\nMy app is free to download on the App Store, and I would love for you to give it a try. All feedback is appreciated, let me know what you think.\n\nhttps://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1138430605?pt=10114193&amp;ct=brown&amp;mt=8",

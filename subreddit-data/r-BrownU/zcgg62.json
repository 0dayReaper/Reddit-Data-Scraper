    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI applied through the Veterans application and received my letter of acceptance last week. I plan on enrolling in the Fall of 2024 (*I am requesting a GAP year due to work &amp; life-related reasons*). I will be moving to Providence, RI, with my Wife over the spring/summer of 2024. Even though it is far out, I wanted to get an idea of what is recommended within the local area.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my post.\n\nEdit; if this isn't the right place to ask, I can post in r/providence.",

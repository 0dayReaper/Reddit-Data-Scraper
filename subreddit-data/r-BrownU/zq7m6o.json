Brown may not be the school that you attend, but wherever you end up is where you are supposed to be. \n\nIt\u2019ll all work out how it is supposed to (even if it may not feel like it rn or tmrw) annnnnd you\u2019ll still do incredible things with your life no matter what.

Most likely, you'll be very happy wherever you end up, even if it wasn't initially your first choice. However, if you go there and really feel like where you ended up is *not* where you're supposed to be, there's always the option of changing it. I'm a transfer to Brown and it's been great :)",

Just stating that wherever you end up is where you\u2019re supposed to be at that moment in time\u2014 even if that\u2019s not where you are long term. If tmrw\u2019s a rejection then it allows them the opportunity to explore further things and grow from the experience. They may end up at Brown in the future, but things such as rejections are an opportunity to explore other things out there and figure out what they do or do noooot want out of a college experience. I just think it\u2019s really important to note (as I have previously) that even when things don\u2019t wind up how we want them to, there are little nuggets and lessons to take as we push forward",

And, more importantly, there are many people who fall in love with the school they end up attending even if it was not their first choice. Frankly, Brown was not my first choice. I was very bummed I did not get into some other schools. But looking back, I am glad I ended up at Brown and would not change things if I had the chance. One of my best friends had Brown as her first choice, but ended up feeling incredibly grateful she did not get in and went to Bowdoin. It happens.",

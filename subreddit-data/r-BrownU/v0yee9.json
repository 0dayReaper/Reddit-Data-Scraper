    "postText": "Hello everyone! I had a few questions about choosing courses as an incoming student.  \n\n\n1) When exactly should I register for courses? Do I just have to add courses to my cart and register or do I need to get my courses approved by an advisor as well?  \n\n\n2) How exactly do you \"shop\" classes?  \n\n\n3) I am not sure which CS intro course to take... Should I try out two intro CS courses or will the extra intro course be excessive?  \n\n\n4) If any of you have experience with Astronomy courses, how intense is the courseload for introductory courses?  \n\n\n5) Is there a resource that can help me decide what math class might be best for me? I am familiar with the basics of calculus but I'm not sure how well my high-school education will translate to college.  \n\n\nThank you so much for your time! My apologies if this is not the best place to post this. Hope you have an amazing rest of your day!",

Do the homework assignments for all the classes you\u2019re somewhat serious about\n\n3) You can definitely shop multiple. I\u2019m sure most people do that but eventually stick with the one they like the best and drop the rest after a couple weeks.\n\n4) idk\n\n5) There\u2019s a placement test. Honestly, college math classes do teach a lot more than calc ab/bc, but it shouldn\u2019t really matter. If you got like a 4 on the ap exams, you know enough of the most important shit to move forward and learn the stuff you missed later.",

If you\u2019d like to take CS at a faster pace / if you have experience / etc, then check out [cs19](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs019/)! they have a summer placement (not open yet) that you need to pass to be admitted into the class. taking cs19 allows you to skip a semester of intro cs, but beware it\u2019s a difficult course with a high time commitment. good luck :)",

            "comment": "Astronomy TA here:\n\n4: The fall astronomy course (phys 270) is more mathy compared to spring (phys 220). The spring course is mostly meant as a course for non-stem concentrators as there\u2019s very little math, and mostly powerpoint/textbook/short conceptual quizzes type of class. For 270, there is usually a lot of difficult math presented, but you are not expected to understand it all. Knowledge of basic differentiation and integration is very helpful for understanding the material, but most of the homework is more about understanding what equations mean and manipulating them algebraically/basic calculusly. The workload is not very high in my opinion (especially compared to intro CS or intro physics). The class is mostly freshman/sophomores so you won\u2019t be alone. Also probably already mentioned, but you can find reviews of it on the critical review.",

If I've gotten the doctor approval for doing a test, can I walk-in on another day? I know you can walk-in at another time on the same day, but not sure for another day.",

I understand that they are relatively overwhelmed, but it\u2019s annoying that they haven\u2019t developed/invested sufficient testing infrastructure to allow for day-of testing.",

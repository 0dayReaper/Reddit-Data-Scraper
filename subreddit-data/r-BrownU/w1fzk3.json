    "postText": "So last week I (upcoming freshmen) received a letter warning me that my application was voted to be reevaluated for admissions after I dropped my IB points from a 42 predicted to a 37. Despite maintaining my grades at a 40+ each semester, I wonder if it's enough to rescind my offer completely? I understand there was a significant drop, but I had a lot going on with a wildfire at home and I had read so much about people dropping the same or more and being fine. Now, after the letter I am really concerned about getting rescinded because I applied ED so I don't have any other options for school except to just reapply with my worse grades this fall. \n\nI responded and explained the circumstances, but I am worried that because I am receiving so much financial aid they don't have any reason to try and keep me, and that they will rescind. \n\nDoes anyone have any experience with this? Or does anyone know how long it will take for them to decide? I was only told I would be notified after they make a decision but I am not sure when that will be. Thank you in advance.\n\nEdit: Okay well now I am not as worried about the financial aid aspect, but still worried about the overall thing. Thank you.",

That said, if applicable, reach out to admissions and explain any extenuating circumstances that may have affected your performance.",

So they might rescind, but it will not be because they offered you a certain aid package. Good luck!",

            "comment": "Hey there,\n\nLook the honest truth here is no one can tell. Now, over the years, I've given advice to several people who were at risk of being rescinded. Given the lack of any follow up questions after the initial conversation, I'm going to assume none got rescinded. So... those are a few helpful data points. As for my thoughts (I am not part of admissions committee so take with a grain of salt), \n\nA. Make sure you've thoroughly explained the situation with something of this type of diction, \"I understand that my IB scores are significantly lower than predicted. Although I am extremely disappointed in my performance, I was unfortunately dealing with X,Y,Z at the time and really tried my best on the exam. I would like to thoroughly reassure the admissions committee that my scores are not predictive of my academic capability. (If you had high grades throughout the school year, this would be good). Add in a line about how much you really want to attend Brown for X,Y,Z reasons.\n\nB. Again, I can't say for sure what will happen and neither can anyone on here. That being said... having been at Brown for several years now, I do doubt they will rescind over this petty score.\n\nC. As for dealing with the emotional side, I'm sorry for what you're going through. If your family is also extremely stressed along with you, I can't imagine how hard it is. I would recommend seeking professional help if available to you. However, if not, do realize, the decision will come ultimately and it will likely be in your favor (can't say for sure so don't quote me on it).\n\nOverall, it's a tough situation to be in but I'm rooting for you! Hope to see you walk through the Van Winkle Gates this fall :)",

            "comment": "This is a bit late so your situation might be resolved, but Brown is especially notorious for doing this. In my class I know of at least 5-6 people that got these warning letters, granted they all ended up coming so if anyone did get their admission rescinded I wouldn't know. The worst thing that happened was that a few were forced to take gap years (how this helps, I don't know), but others had their teachers and principal send letters of support. The letters they sent back indicated that their academic performance would be under review for the first few semesters but afaik nothing happened and all was well. Hope everything worked out for you!",

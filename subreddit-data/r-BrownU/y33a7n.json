    "postText": "Hello guys, I'm applying to brown and was looking up classes to see what I'd want to do if I got in, especially with open curriculum and whatnot.  However, I was a bit confused over public health classes.  I don't intend on concentrating in public health but I would probably want to take a few courses.  The issue is that I saw a fundamentals epidemiology course (PHP 0850) that says it's only available to people in the public health program.  This confused me a bit and I know that there's a separate school for public health so would I not be able to take any public health course unless I concentrated on it? Apologies if this is obvious I just wanted to make sure.",

            "comment": "Hey there! When I took this course a few years ago it was open to anyone that took PHP 320, but it looks like it was recently changed. Despite this, I would try emailing the professor and asking for an override code (after taking PHP 320). During registration period, there will be an option under that course to request one and you are given some space to type out why you want the code. In it, I would just say that you are \"interested in public health and have taken the necessary prerequisite course. I was hoping I could get an override code?\" If there are seats available you'll probably get a code (I just checked the course and it looked like there were over 20 seats still available, so I'm sure they'd make room for you!). Good luck applying!",

    "postText": "I was recently accepted for Graduate program in Chemistry. I wanted to talk to some students who are already pursuing/ have recently completed PhD from Brown U. Right from the basic things that an international student should know. (I am from India). What do you like? What would you like to change? Must dos and don'ts. How to manage expenses? How to avail funding/scholarships? Accomodation, food, lab environment, research opportunities and all.",

            "comment": "I finished a PoliSci Phd at Brown many (many) moons ago. I used to answer questions for newly admitted minority grad students from a background similar to my own. I'd show them around a week or so before classes and give them my number.\n\nThings may have changed, but The Graduate School used to try to pair international students with newly admitted international students similar to the relationship I described above. \n\nIt may be worth your while to contact The Graduate School and/or your department and ask to be contacted by a grad student that can answer your questions.\n\nMost of the matriculation programs at Brown were geared towards undergraduates when I was at Brown, so you may have to reach out a little more as a graduate student.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck.",

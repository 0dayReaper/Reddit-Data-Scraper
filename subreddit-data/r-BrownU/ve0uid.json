You\u2019ll put 4 classes in your primary cart on cab and then enter the PIN number to register. ~Two weeks after that, reading period ends, and by then you should have your classes picked for the rest of the semester. CSCI 0150 is really all you need for the first semester, but talk to your advisor more during orientation if you\u2019re worried!",

I\u2019d recommend checking out the class during shopping period to get a grasp on difficulty / whether or not the workload will be manageable for you. If it doesn\u2019t feel like a good fit, check out CSCI 0111 which is a lot less work overall and is better designed to introduce core CS concepts to those that haven\u2019t had prior experience!",

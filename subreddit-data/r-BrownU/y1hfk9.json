Can this still get me in trouble for unknown/large/persistent traffic or if they somehow figured out I'm torrenting through analyzing traffic characteristics? Thanks a lot!",

Don't download anything weird though...\n\nAll we can see when you use a VPN is that you're connected to a tunnel. I've moved hundred of GB on Brown wifi using a VPN. Nobody's really hunting for that kinda stuff.\n\nAlso, when I say \"we\" I really mean it. Next time you go to the IT center, it might be me helping with your issue.\n\nEdit: \n\nPeople are saying that they got caught and got a slap on the wrist. This is because the issue is not so common. This is not an invitation to pirate freely. If a bunch of people start torrenting on Brown wifi and getting caught, it's gonna become a common issue and I suspect consequences will be introduced. I'm pretty sure ISPs can take legal action against Brown if the torrenting gets outta control and the Rat E can't handle any less funding.\n\nTLDR: Use a VPN and stop torrenting because that's illegal!",

I'm gonna give you one piece of advice that is going to help you through the rest of your life:\n\n\"Act like you belong and you will belong.\"\n\nIf you keep questioning yourself and backtracking, you'll get nowhere. \n\nTorrent on a VPN until you get a slap on the wrist. Brown isn't going to kick out a paying student just because you downloaded a movie. \n\nHave that conversation with your advisor about your course changes. If you go into it all apologetic the advisor will think you're an idiot. Which you aren't, you got into Brown.\n\nJust act like you meant to do everything you did. And eventually you won't be turning to reddit to ask how to use a push door.",

But the interviewer turned out to have a personal relationship with someone who didn't like my friend's father (competitive business owners in the same space) and he brought it up during my friends interview. She was promptly told she was waitlisted after that interview.\n\nI told her that she should tell Brown what happened. Not to get the interviewer in trouble, but to point out the conflict of interest. She didn't because she was \"too afraid to sound like one of those people who complain.\" Because of that she didn't get into her dream school.\n\nAct like you belong. Don't be afraid of what others think.",

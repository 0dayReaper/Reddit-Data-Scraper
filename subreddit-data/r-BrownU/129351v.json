    "postText": "hi everybody, i was recently accepted to brown and am considering concentrating in modern culture and media. i was wondering if there is anybody here who is a MCM concentrator and could tell me how it is and what your career aspirations are as i think MCM is super interesting but i\u2019m unsure of where it could take me in the future. i think i want to do product management or business in the entertainment industry so i\u2019m wondering if brown MCM (with a double concentration in something else?) would be a good choice. thanks!",

            "comment": "MCM and Econ or MCM and CS would be good for the roles you described, but just take the time to explore during shopping period / first and second year and see which classes you gravitate towards more. So many students at Brown enter with an intended concentration (like myself) and end up doing something completely different, which is always a fun story to tell! The open curriculum at Brown allows you to try things out and figure out what you like and you have nearly 4 semesters to decide. Also, if you\u2019re interested in film and media studies, many departments aside from MCM offer classes in that field, such as History, East Asian Studies, Gender, etc. so check those out too.",

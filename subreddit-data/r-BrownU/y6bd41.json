    "postText": "My nephew is shy and can sometimes isolate and slip into depression. He's not the best at reaching out for help. He's had some struggles with falling into a funk but he's still a great student and has managed to pull out very good grades and scores but we all worry about him being away from home although his parents are in Boston so not so far. Is Brown a nurturing place for freshman? Is there a stigma in perhaps taking first-year classes c/nc? He's Af-Am. Is there a nurturing Af-Am community?",

I haven\u2019t heard a single person speak positively of CAPS (the mental health service). \n\nI would say Brown is pretty nurturing for freshmen. Overall, the community is very welcoming and Brown frequently gets noted as having some of the nicest students at an Ivy. \n\nThere\u2019s no stigma in taking classes s/nc. A lot of people take a few classes s/nc, and the school encourages it. \n\nThere\u2019s an awesome African-American community here! He could join the Black Students Union, or become part of Harambe House (an all-black dorm) after freshmen year",

I mean, the good experience was that they referred me to long-term therapy off campus, but that was really important for me to do! And they did the right amount of hand-holding to make sure I actually made those phone calls.\n\n(I can't speak to african american community personally, except that i know it exists!)",

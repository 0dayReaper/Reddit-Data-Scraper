Got into Brown Regular Decision for CS, and as a prospective student who's deciding on whether to commit here or another great school, I was wondering if anyone knows if there are any opportunities (classes/programs/research) in Mixed Reality, such as XR, VR, and AR? This is sort of a niche interest of mine that I'd love to continue in college, hopefully at Brown if there are any courses or programs that correlate with my niche. Thanks!",

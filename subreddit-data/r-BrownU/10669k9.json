    "postText": "hi! i got into brown ED and was looking into doing a campus tour. i'm from georgia so we'd have to schedule rather meticulously, and i was just wondering if brown ever did tours in the summer. the latest they have scheduled is may 9th, and we're considering going during my spring break but it's baseball season for my brother and so it's a bit difficult to get the schedule just right.\n\njust wondering what our best option would be! also, any long distance travelers that go to brown, if you have any money-saving travel tips pls drop them here lol :)",

In theory Delta PVD-ATL should be cheaper, but in reality it's often cheaper to fly to Boston and take the commuter rail/bus to Providence.",

    "postText": "I keep seeing threads about the association with brown requesting counselor first-quarter grades and admission. Am I the only one whose counselor posted their first quarter grades to the common app? My guidance counselor told me that counselors usually post first-quarter grades on their side of the common app, and they posted sometime around the 19th. Is my guidance counselor just one of the early ones who posted first-quarter grades or something?",

If you followed directions and did this, the AO likely doesn\u2019t need to email your counselor for additional information. So don\u2019t read anything into the AO not emailing if grades were already submitted.",

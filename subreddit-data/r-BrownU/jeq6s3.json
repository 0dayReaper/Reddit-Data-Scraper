Unfortunately, the [downturn after the dot-com boom](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/CSCapacity/CSCapacity-History2000s.html) really scared university administrators away from allocating hiring slots (particularly professorships) to computer science departments. They worry the current growth is *also* just a bubble.\n\n(Our CS department's enormous undergrad TA program is one way we've coped with the shortage of educators.)\n\nFortunately, this reluctance *is* finally fading and our department, recently, as been hiring.",

Also I bet a general \u201cHumanities\u201d versus \u201cSTEM\u201d would illuminate a real divide. As an upperclassman taking math classes, I still had 30ish students in most of my classes. My history seminars had 15 max, often less. \n\nAlso, though, this might treat independent studies too dismissively. My experience at Brown is that independent work was quite easy to organize. This really did give me a super personalized experience with professors who served as my advisors for independent work. I think that these opportunities are not super well advertised among undergrads though so most people I know didn\u2019t do them. But it\u2019s a real option!",

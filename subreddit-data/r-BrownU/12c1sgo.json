    "postText": "Hey everybody! I'm an incoming freshman who will probably need a single because of my disability, and will also be living in sub-free housing. Will this severely hinder / limit my social options? How much of the student culture comes from having a roommate? Can anyone with a single speak to the experience?\n\nThank you so much, I've really appreciated all the help and advice this sub has given me :)",

While I do know that some people are close with their roommates, most of my friends aren\u2019t, and just live together but run in completely different social circles. My roommate and I are basically just acquaintances who live together and don\u2019t do anything else.",

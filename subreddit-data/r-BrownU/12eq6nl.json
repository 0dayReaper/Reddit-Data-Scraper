            "comment": "For Pure Math, the math department is where many talented math students go to switch to applied math. This is the case with top institutions, where the professors are brilliant mathematicians but poor pedagogues. \n\nFor a great math education, you will want to pick classes based on professors and not their content. You cannot go wrong with any top math department if you do this. \n\nTake this from a pure math + apma/cs concentrator undergrad taking graduate math classes: the department is hit or miss, use the critical review to pick your classes. Just because your professor is brilliant, doesn\u2019t mean they can teach.",

            "comment": "Brown Math is incredible.  Every single class I\u2019ve taken has had BANGER professor after BANGER professor\u2014 literally every single one (4).  The first Math class I took convinced me to take more, and after the third i\u2019m probably gonna end up majoring in it.\n\nTo answer your question:\n\n1) Professors are just amazing amazing, they are another level.  One of my professors for abstract last semester literally solved the interpolation problem with her husband that very year\u2014 a huge breakthrough in the field.\n\n2) Undergrad research.  Never done math research but I do know as a TA for a math class you have the opportunity to do an independent reading with your prof where you meet with them a few times a week to read and go over papers\n\n3) There is a lot of depth!  In my graph theory class we covered every topic in the textbook\u2014 same for linear algebra (axler).  My abstract class was also noticeably more rigorous than at other schools.  I have a friend taking the same class at a different university and the syllabus covers about 60% of what we covered.  And the class did not feel rushed either, we just has very carefully thought out homework problems that allowed us to explore multiple topics in abstract at the same time.  On the flip side though, the homeworks took a while lol.  But they were super worth it",

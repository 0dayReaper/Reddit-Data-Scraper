General rule of thumb: the washer and dryers suck. \n\nThere are two general first year campuses: Pembroke (Hotel Andrews/Metcalf/MillerEmWool/MoChamp) and Keeney Quad. Keeney is not as bad as people say, but they are definitely more rowdy imo. Wayland was a first year dorm my year, and it is the crappy dorm because there is no elevator.  Most first year dorms are close to the dining halls, which can be nice since they force you to be on meal plan. You can apply to be in special housing such as quiet hall, substance free, or same sex. \n\nAs for upper level housing, it varies a lot. I lived in Barbour, which has huge rooms and suites and is pretty nice but far from main campus and north campus. About a block or two away, Young Orchard has suite style living with really small bedrooms, imo.",

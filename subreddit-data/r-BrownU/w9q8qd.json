    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman studying apma-cs. I've also been playing cello for 8 years, and want to begin learning music theory and try my hand at composition. I've been looking at the intro music classes in CAB and would like to get some advice from anyone who's taken these classes!\n\nMUSC 200: What is this class like? Do you learn music theory and composition skills, or just production? Would it prepare me well for a class like MUSC 550, which I am considering taking in the spring?\n\nMUSC 400A/B: Firstly, what is the difference between the two courses? Secondly, how is this course and which one would better prepare me for MUSC 550? \n\nAlthough I've played cello for 8 years, I've never had any formal music theory education. Basically, I don't really know any of the terms, but could understand if you explain it to me in the context of stringed instruments. So for anyone who could graciously give me some advice, hopefully that gives you a good idea of where I'm at musically. Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "When I started brown I had ~12 years of cello experience, and like you never learned any theory. I did musc 400 (there wasn\u2019t the A/B split) and I found it fairly easy but really fun. Looking at CAB, seems to me the only difference is B focuses on modern music more? Not really sure but if I had to guess musc 400A is the old musc 400 class. 400 will prepare you if you want to take 550. I never took 200 but I don\u2019t think it would help with musc 550 very much if at all. I would just shop both 400A and B and decide then",

Otherwise outside of brown I don\u2019t think it would be too hard to find a teacher in the area. I had stopped taking lessons by the time I started at brown so can\u2019t really give a too much insight\n\nhttps://music.brown.edu/music-making/lessons",

            "comment": "I also have about \\~12/13 years of cello experience, but I knew some basic theory. I took MUSC 0400A. For me, it was mainly all review until the late half of the semester content-wise. However, we did practice piano, sight singing, and transcribing by ear. These skills are really important (from what I heard) for MUSC 0550. If you don't have experience with the aforementioned skills MUSC 0400A is important. You might also have to self-study a bit before taking MUSC 0550 as there is a jump difficulty-wise.\n\nMUSC 0400A and 0400B don't seem very different from what I heard. You just might spend a bit more time on pop music, which we also looked at in 400A. This all likely depends on the instructor teaching it. I wouldn't stress about, which class is better. Just take the one where the content and the instructor vibes with you better. I had Cheung for 400A and he was very chill and understanding.\n\nI agree with PixelRa, musc 0200 won't help with 0550 or pure composition skills, but it would probably be a fun class to take. I would take it in addition to musc 0400 if you have the space. Feel free to DM if you have questions about 400A or premed if you happen to be doing that as well.",

I played piano for a long time but haven't been touching it for a long while at the time when I took the course. Overall it wasn't as easy as I expected it to be - you will need some practice on keyboard, singing, interval identification and etc. In general I spend around 6 hours with it and I still have severe flaws on intervals identification and pitch-matching. Do be prepared for time commitment.",

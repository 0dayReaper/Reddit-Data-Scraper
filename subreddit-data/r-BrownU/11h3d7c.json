    "postText": "International student here, I was wondering if anyone has any previous experience regarding the question in the title. I should also say that I am not interested in taking a loan. I am aware that there exist some scholarships (depending on the grad school), but these generally do not cover more than 10-20% of tuition. Could an admitted student somehow negotiate bigger tuition waiver, based on their inability (not unwillingness) to pay? If yes, is there a maximum amount of tuition waiver that Brown can offer, or does it completely depend on the particular situation? \n\nLots of small questions here, I apologize! Any info is greatly appreciated.",

Inability, it depends.",

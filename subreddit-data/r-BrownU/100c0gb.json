    "postText": "I've recently been accepted ED, and my application indicated that I'd have the second half of one of my courses, AP CSP. However, the class has been dropped from my schedule in the second semester due to issues with my teacher (this is an online course). So, my transcript only has 0.5 credits for AP CSP; however, the course still has a grade on my transcript. Should I contact the admissions office and tell them that I won't be taking the class in the second semester, or should I save the trouble because I still have the grade for the class on my final transcript? In my common application, I indicated that this course would be both a first and second semester class, by the way.",

My daughter (class of 2026) had a spring schedule change last year as a senior and I think her ED acceptance letter was pretty clear about letting them know. She needed to replace it with an equally challenging course that the AO had to approve. .",

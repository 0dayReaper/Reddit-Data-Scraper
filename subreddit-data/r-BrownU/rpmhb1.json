    "postText": "So when I get to Brown the first thing I am going to do is go up to the Bruno statue get on my hands and knees and open my asshole ferociously and beg for Bruno to take me and dominate my booty hole. I want to feel his claws on my back as he grunts at every single stroke and then I want to turn around and stare into his big brown eyes as he splurges all over my face with his big load of Bruno cum. I\u2019m also really excited to use the open curriculum to connect all my interests!!!",

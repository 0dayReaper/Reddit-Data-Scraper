    "postText": "Hey everyone I was lucky enough to be accepted into 2 amazing schools and I just really can\u2019t decide between them. I was wondering what would be the best school so that I can get into a top medical school (Johns Hopkins med is literally the dream)\n\n\nYale \n\nPros: \n\nBetter Dorms and Food \n\nRanked #1 for undergraduate biochemistry \n\nBetter research scene? (Not really sure on this one, I\u2019m pretty sure brown has an amazing research program too)\n\nBetter placement at top medical schools\n\nPrestige (of course this doesn\u2019t matter too much but med schools apps are so competitive that everything helps)\n\nCons: \n\nNew Haven isn\u2019t the best city (I\u2019d still be fine living there though)\n\nCurriculum structure is weird with 36 classes.\n\nBrown:\n\nPros:\n\nOpen curriculum. I love the open curriculum and how much freedom it gives me to actually study what I want.\n\nRanked #4 for undergraduate biochemistry \n\nSchool environment. I like how collaborative Brown is and much of the toxicity around being a premed is gone at Brown.\n\nMore focus on undergraduate education. Also I won\u2019t have to compete with grad students for research positions.\n\nCons: \n\nPlacement into t25 medical schools is worse than Yale (67.96% vs. 25.99% not sure if this is because of the type of students that go to brown though)\n\nSome old/outdated facilities\n\nCost isn\u2019t a factor, both schools cost the same and my family is fortunate to be able to afford it.",

            "comment": "First, you can go to a \u201ctop\u201d med school regardless if you go to Yale or Brown. It\u2019s about what you do with the resources there, and there are plenty at both, so definitely focus on the vibe and if you see yourself thriving there. For Brown, the bio department is very strong in both research and advising. You are also encouraged to explore classes outside of biology, which not only make you look \u201cgood\u201d and well rounded to med schools but also cultivate your perspective and knowledge. \n\nAs someone who got into T20 med schools coming from Brown and met many successful Yale grads, you will be fine at either school. Congrats and good luck!",

Can anyone who has taken both of these classes give me the basic difference between the two and any other thoughts/opinions? Is it stupid to take these at the same time or is there enough overlap that they could inform eachother in a positive way? Any info would be much appreciated\n\nThank yuh",

NEUR 0010 focuses on the biological and chemical basis of the human brain (eg how action potentials are caused through the opening and closing of sodium and potassium channels), whereas CLPS 0010 focuses on less on the bio side and more on broader concepts like perception, illusion, and processing (essentially, the effect of the biological side of things).",

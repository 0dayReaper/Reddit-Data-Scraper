Depending on the class, you will likely have a TA lead them to discuss weekly readings and analysis as a group. It\u2019s your opportunity to discuss critically with other students and have open discussion on topics in lecture you don\u2019t necessarily have.\n\nUnlike high school, you don\u2019t have open discussion taken out of lecture time. Raising your hand TOO often is sometimes deemed as interruptive. I learned that the hard way with my professor emailing me one day asking me (politely) to tone it down in my ENVS course \ud83d\ude2c",

Most balance their lives pretty equally between their academic and social commitments, so it\u2019s not a \u201cparty school,\u201d but neither is it a place where fun goes to die. There\u2019s definitely a lack of school spirit here when compared to a large state school, however.\n \nBrown gets a rap for being very liberal, but I think there\u2019s certainly a large contingent of moderates on campus that aren\u2019t as vocal. In terms of demographics, Brown is incredibly diverse for a historically elitist institution\u2014and practically everyone is accepting of different races, ethnicities, religions, and nationalities.",

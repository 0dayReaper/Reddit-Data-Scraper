    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m In my second semester and Live in keeney, it\u2019s weird cause if I test the WiFi speeds it gives me crazy numbers like 300 mb/s. For streaming and going online it works perfectly but for playing online games \u2014 I play csgo\u2014 it\u2019s suuuuper laggy and glitchy, the kind of problems you get when you\u2019re on awful WiFi. I know it\u2019s not a problem with my computer, and even on WiFi networks that i know are way worse, like mine at home, it runs so much better. Since there\u2019s no Ethernet ports, is there any solution to this? I know there\u2019s like gaming teams here so there must be a way to make your connection better. Thanks",

The internet is really fast, but the latency is mediocre to straight out bad, even when the game reports acceptable latency.\n\nWe're opening up a gaming lounge sometime next week - the PCs will still be on WiFi, but OIT has put a lot of work into making sure it's as stable as possible, and for the most part, tests so far seem to be looking okay. More info on this soon!\n\nPS: Join us on Discord to learn about our upcoming events (and the gaming lounge launch)! https://discord.gg/brownesports",

            "comment": "What are the upload and ping values? Also do you consistently get 300mb/s over a few trials? I lived in Keeney freshman year (senior now) and I feel like I remember seeing download speeds of 15-20 mb/s via ookla speed test. That being said, I played a lot of titanfall that year and the WiFi was nearly always fine for multiplayer. As for a solution, if you\u2019re gaming on a pc, you could try upgrading your PCIe WiFi card to one that will get better reception.",

Honestly I would rather have 15 mbps if it was stable in game like a normal WiFi connection. What I have now feels like I\u2019m switching networks every few seconds which causes huge spikes, constant rubberbanding and teleporting. I\u2019m on a mac so upgrading the card isn\u2019t really an option",

Regardless, you might consider sending an email to IT about the problem and saying that it impacts your scholarly work. Otherwise maybe Brown Guest would be a more stable WiFi connection while gaming",

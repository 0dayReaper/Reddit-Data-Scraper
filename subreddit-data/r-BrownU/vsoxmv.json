            "comment": "Favorite: I really love complementary RIPTA (public bus) access with our Brown IDs. Providence has a ton to offer, especially if you love food, and you're missing out a ton if you don't take advantage of free RIPTA. (Okay, maybe this isn't my *favorite* thing, but it's up there, and it's something you should know about Brown.)\n\nLeast favorite: The school is very stingy. I wouldn't say this is a Brown-specific thing, but in my three full years at Brown, I've watched the tuition and meal plan price crawl up and the dining get progressively worse with increasingly limited options. Dorms are okay, but some are old and not well-maintained. Laundry works maybe 75% of the time, and it's $1.50 per wash and $1.50 per dry.",

I love when I meet someone who is really passionate about something, even if I don\u2019t know anything about it, and that happens a lot at Brown.\n\nLeast favorite: laundry systems suckkkkk. There aren\u2019t enough washers/dryers in any given dorm and when they\u2019re broken it takes a long time to fix.\n\nGeneral things I like: walkability of campus, connections, there\u2019s a lot to do at any given time.\n\nGeneral things I don\u2019t like: the expensive meal plan and the decreasing quality (I guess that\u2019s not ALL Brown\u2019s fault though), dorms that take forever to get renovated leading to terrible disparities in quality",

But for me, the best part is the fact that every student WANTS to be in every class they are taking. (And if not, you are doing Brown wrong.) That means that certain courses can be super self selecting (leading to a lack of diversity of perspective in discussion), but even an echo chamber is better than silence imo. Shopping period is chaotic but awesome. \n\nLeast favorite: capped classes. A lot of courses are capped ridiculously low, and it\u2019s possible to try to take a class every time it is offered and still not take it before you graduate.",

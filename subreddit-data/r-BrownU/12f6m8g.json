I\u2019m going to try to appeal \u2014 anyone been through this process before? I\u2019d love to go to Brown, but 20k/yr is going to financially burden my family. Thanks in advance!! I\u2019d appreciate any advice or insight into the appeal process.",

I made an appointment with a FA counselor and instead of meeting with me she just sent my appeal (without documents) and I just got 1k more lol\u2026 \n\nGonna submit my 2022 paperwork and see what happens.

I never went to college, and so I'm the last person who should be telling him where to go for a student loans and/or aid.    He's done all the FAFSA paperwork and such.  Will FA help him in finding a place to get a student loan for his portion?  I will also tell him to appeal with FA to see if he can appeal for more.",

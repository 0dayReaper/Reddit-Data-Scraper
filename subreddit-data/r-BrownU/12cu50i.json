    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m a newly international admit with full ride. As an international student on full ride, how likely is it for us to spend out-of-pocket? I\u2019m also on full ride at Dartmouth and named a king scholar. At Dartmouth, I\u2019ll get extra benefits such as annual trip expenses to my country and special travels. But I really love Brown and I do not want to lean towards Dartmouth because of those opportunities alone. Plus, Brown expect me to contribute 2810$ annually from on campus employment. \n\nMy question is that have you experienced any financial struggle at Brown and how hard is it to have a good work-life balance as an international student on full ride?\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

When I called today they said that it\u2019s essentially what we should bring with us for spending money and we can get a work study that would give us that amount for our own personal use. You\u2019re not required to pay that amount they\u2019re offering it to you through a work study. And that work study is also not mandatory. This is what I was told this morning, hope that helps!",

            "comment": "If you don't plan on eating out your costs should be minimal. Brown provides transportation around campus and you get free RIPTA (bus) access via your student ID. The only out of pocket costs you would have to worry about are for socializing if you want to go out on the weekend. Personally I spent maybe 100-200 a month during first year and this included eating out on Thayer st once a week. If you do an internship in CS/consulting/IB/quant etc you'd easily make 20-30k during the summer so in subsequent years money would be a lot less tight.",

            "comment": "You should apply to the fli scholar program for first years at Brown. I have a friend who is international on a full ride and she receives a stipend every semester. Since you\u2019re on a full ride, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re low income which qualifies you for this program. Also keep in mind you get a financial aid refund. Not sure how the tax situation works where you\u2019re from, my friend gets some of her stipend taxed but she still gets to keep a good amount. Still encourage you to apply I think you\u2019ll receive an email soon if you qualify asking you if you want to apply.\n\nLike others mentioned, you can also get an on campus job.",

I don\u2019t think people are accepted based on their actual application responses but more on availability.  I remember the application consisted of a resume and few short prompts.",

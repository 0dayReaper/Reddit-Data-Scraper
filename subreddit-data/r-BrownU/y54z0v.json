    "postText": "I'm a high school senior applying to colleges, and Brown is one of my top choices because of its open curriculum can enable me to further my academic interests in both computer science and the social sciences. Within computer science, I want to get a solid training on system programming and system design. My question is, how rigorous, well resourced, and well taught are Brown's computer systems courses (e.g. Operating Systems, Database Systems, Distributed Systems)?",

            "comment": "Adding on, there are definitely a bunch of cool research opportunities and ways to engage with systems beyond classes. However, I can't compare with other universities and I'm sure more technical universities known for their CS may have more opportunities. The good thing about brown cs is its inclusivity. With little prior knowledge and experience, you can get into classes, and then research and TA positions. Also since its a liberal arts school, you could find interesting work at the intersection of your interests. Good luck!",

How much of a hassle are they on the professor's end? (low key afraid to request one)\n\nI want to explore this option of the open curriculum but don't know where to start.\n\nThank y'all awesome souls!",

The CPR itself is pretty short, maybe a paragraph in length, and the content likely depends from class to class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRegarding asking or not is totally up to you, just know that the professor can decide not to if it's not mandatory S/NC (otherwise is required). I'd also email the professor/tell them that you've requested one via ASK, though the system probably sends them an automated email as well.",

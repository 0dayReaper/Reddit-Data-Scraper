I found out about my housing in mid August.\n\nYou basically fill out a roommate match with a couple of questions and they match you with people who put the same answers. You can also select into a specific community (same sex, substance free, or quiet housing). There's also the option to apply for religious accommodations.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!",

Options are: 8 PM to 10 PM, 10 PM to 12 AM, 12 AM to 2 AM (I think)\n\n3) What time do you wake up? They give options and I think they are: 5 AM - 7 AM, 7 AM - 9 AM, 9 AM - 11 AM\n\n4) What is your level of cleanliness? There are three options and the only one I can remember is \"neat.\"\n\n5) How close do you want to be with your roommate? Options are: Best Friend, Acquaintance, and something else that basically just means you acknowledge each other\n\nThese are the only ones I can remember but it's a very short survey unless you apply with accommodations! Let me know if you have any more questions.",

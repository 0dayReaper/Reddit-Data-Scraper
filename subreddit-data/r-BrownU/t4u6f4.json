    "postText": "Brown has multiple intro tracks for computer science. The CS019 course taught by Prof Shriram Krishnamurthi compresses a lot of stuff into the course and teach it in a functional style (so it seems at first glance). Recently, the book used in the course called DCIC ([https://dcic-world.org/](https://dcic-world.org/)) was published. It is used by both CS019 and CS111 at Brown. DCIC is a more complete and modified version than its predecessor PAPL ([https://papl.cs.brown.edu/](https://papl.cs.brown.edu/)). DCIC is something a student outside Brown can also read and solve through. \n\nNow, my question to people who have taken CS019. How did it affect your entire CS education at Brown or afterwards (after graduating)? Were you ahead of others due to the accelerated content? Did it benefit by learning functional programming before any imperative style course? Did it make you a better programmer or problem solver? Or was it not worth the hype? \n\nAnd another question, who seriously did CS019 and liked it, did you read the entire HtDP book and also maybe SICP which is mentioned in the course credits? If you did read them, was reading HtDP a bonus addition to what was taught in CS019?\n\nIf you plan to take CS173 (or maybe read through PLAI) later, does taking CS019 create any considerable advantage? Other intro course people who took CS173 did you get the exact jaw-dropping delight from taking it?\n\nLooking forward to knowing more about the courses.",

HtDP was used to introduce us to programming and functional concepts through racket.  We flipped around the first section and second section and the MAIN focus was on higher order functions (super super important).  DCIC is Shrirams newest textbook centered around data  using the language he wrote for education: Pyret.  We spent most of the time in DCIC land and only a little time using HtDP (only for placement)\n\nReddit wont let me post it as a comment because its long.\n\nIf you do DCIC beforehand you actually might find part of the course material boring / repetitive.  I\u2019m not sure I would call that a better position or not.\n\nA major benefit of reading DCIC however is all of the instruction that they cant fit into a one semester course.\n\nIf you plan on taking the course then I would wait to read DCIC.  Otherwise try and complete the course projects alongside the text (found in archived previous offerings of the website).  That is to say: the course does not follow DCIC 1:1.  It mostly skips around in the latter half of the book.  The first part of the book is mostly followed by cs111.",

Knowing functional programming certainly would not helped me on my job search at all. \n\nI had the option of taking CS19 (went thru the summer placement and all that), but ultimately chose not to. It depends what you want. I mean absolutely no judgment in this \u2014 if you want to be challenged and learn a different type of CS than AP CS, then cs19 may be a good choice for you. Just be aware that people have very\u2026 divided opinions on Shriram as a professor, and that you will probably struggle through it (as well as cs32, if that\u2019s still the standard course to take after 19). Friends who did take 19 said it was a *lot* of work. \n\nIf your main goal is to optimize for a high paying FAANG job, then there\u2019s no need (and probably would be detrimental) to take 19. Cs16 (I think this has changed) taught the concepts necessary to pass technical interviews. The other courses, less so. \n\nIf you\u2019ve already taken AP CS (or similar) in high school, then cs15 will probably be (relatively) a breeze for you. If you\u2019re in this situation, and want to have a relatively easy time like I did (no shame in that), take 15.\n\nI have friends who took 15/16, 17/18, and 19/32. They all turned out fine. If you do plan on taking 19, just be aware that you\u2019re voluntarily choosing a more difficult path, and you should enjoy what you\u2019re doing.",

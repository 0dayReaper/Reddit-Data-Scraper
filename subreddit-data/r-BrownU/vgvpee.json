    "postText": "Hi! Are you a rising high school senior or do you know a rising high school senior who is starting to apply to colleges?\n\nI am a part of Uchange Scholars, a mentoring organization founded at the University of Illinois that connects high schoolers from underrepresented backgrounds (e.g. students who are part of racial/ethnic minorities, first generation college students, and from low-socioeconomic backgrounds) with college students for one-on-one assistance with the college application and decision process. Mentees meet one-on-one with their assigned mentor to work on each part of the college application process, and are provided with information, support, and structure.\n\nWe have mentors &amp; leadership who are current students at Brown, and mentees that live in the Providence and greater Rhode Island community. We are currently recruiting more mentees for our third cohort to start at the end of the month.\n\nPlease fill out the following brief interest form to join our program. Slots are filling up quickly so fill out the form ASAP: [https://forms.gle/J7G8aCbs32YFpiECA](https://forms.gle/J7G8aCbs32YFpiECA)\n\nFeel free to message me if you have any specific questions about the program.",

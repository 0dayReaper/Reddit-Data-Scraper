I absolutely love Cornell, except for 4 things\n\n    Harsh grading - It feels like every professor is out to get you here and eeking out an A is a challenge. I hear we have really bad grade deflation\n    \n    Bad finaid - they are really stingy with aid here, to the point where affording to go here is a challenge even if you straddle the full ride line\n    \n    Not in New England - the absolute bastion of higher level education isn't exactly in central NY\n    \n    Shafting of the humanities - Cornell is dogwater for anything nonSTEM. You will feel like a second class citizen almost consistently here\n\nI wish I could stay in Ith, but it seems my only options are to transfer. Ideally I would transfer to here or Dartmouth, given how laid-back I know you both are with grading. How much effort, if any, would it take to get a history degree from here? Do you guys recommend I transfer? I haven't tried, though I shouldve, since I didn't want to waste money on an app beforehand (cost is a big factor)",

Student groups can become political when the objective evaluation of prospective leadership candidates is difficult. I won\u2019t get into the current culture of the BDH as my experience is limited to writing a few articles as a first year. I will say the editorial staff and all the editors skew rich, white, elitist, and male. There hasn\u2019t been a black participant in meaningful capacity for years.\n\nFor environmental activism, I suggest attending the club fair and joining all of them. The dynamic of some of these clubs changes so quickly - not that covid didn\u2019t hurt them in this regard. If you\u2019re looking for national branding, although they stray from their lame too often for my liking, Sunrise has a somewhat-robust org structure. If your interest is more intellectual, look into the environmental housing options and specific groups they associate with.",

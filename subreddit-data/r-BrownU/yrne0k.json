    "postText": " \n\nHello all! I am a freshman on pre-med track, planning to take a math course in addition to chem 350. Both Calc II (math 100) and multivariable (math 180) are taught by D Katz, I got 5 on both AB and BC, wondering if this is too heavy of a load by taking 180 rather than retaking Calc II? Does 180 involve a lot of proof (I was not that good at Geometry while I was at HS) Thanks!!!",

            "comment": "180 does not involve proofs, but does require a lot of spacial thinking. I thought it was an interesting class and I\u2019m happy I took it, but I agree that for premed it doesn\u2019t give you anything above what math 100 does. \n\nSo it basically just depends on how much math you want to learn. If you found calculus interesting, you\u2019ll probably enjoy 180, if you just did it to get into college, then just retake Calc II",

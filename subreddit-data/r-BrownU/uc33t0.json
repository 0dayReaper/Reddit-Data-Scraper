    "postText": "Hey everyone, I'm moving to Brown for grad school and have a toddler. Looking to find a nice, quiet, new (or at least new-ish) apartment complex. For Brown grad students/ staff, where do the majority of them live? Providence or elsewhere? Is the east side of Providence where most Brown affiliated individuals live? Any specific apartment buildings that are frequented by Brown students and staff? Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "If you want to financially survive\u2026you are going to likely need to live in the city (away from east side providence). \n\nBrown doesn\u2019t know how to cater to families, they are set up for younger singles. The cost to rent near the college is exorbitant. It is tougher living in the city, but this is what most families do and then take the bus (free for Brown students) to College Hill. \n\nNew(ish) is something you are unlikely to find in Providence, anywhere. It is also famously infested with pests! There is a reason the Big Blue Bug is a landmark. \n\nGood luck!",

And looking back, my wife probably would have chosen this instead\u2014we didn\u2019t know anything about the geography of providence land it\u2019s surrounding towns. \n\nThe only caveat I would provide is to ask yourself what experience you want. Warwick is great, but like any other suburb for the most part. (I still think we would probably choose this if we were doing it again.) if you want the \u201ccity experience\u201d with all its ups and downs, it may be worth it to some!",

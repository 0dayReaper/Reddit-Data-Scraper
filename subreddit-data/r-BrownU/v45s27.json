Does anyone know if these will be accepted as transfer credits, or will they not be accepted? Don't want to waste a couple thousand if they aren't going to be credited.",

            "comment": "If it\u2019s pertinent to your major requirements, you can argue for those credits to count later down the road with avery or whoever the transfer coordinator may be at that time. However, it isn\u2019t guaranteed. Brown doesn\u2019t really like awarding credit for summer courses taken elsewhere, especially if its only purpose is to advance standing\n\nIf it\u2019s at your current university and is a \u201chigher level\u201d course of one you took during the spring or fall, there\u2019s a loophole if ur just trying to get an equivalency granted (without trying to advance your standing). If u took calc 1, for example, in the spring then calc 2 during the summer, u would probably only be granted credit in the system for the spring course. However, when submitting an equivalency request on ASK, u can submit it for calc 2, as it just shows up as \u201cUnassigned Math Credit\u201d on banner/ask.\n\nNone of this makes sense, but it all will the day before u move in as a transfer\n\nI\u2019d recommend u not take summer courses unless ur studying engineering or something else where u need to get ahead as possible",

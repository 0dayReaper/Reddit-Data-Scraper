    "postText": "Hey all! My name is Will \u2014 I\u2019m a reporter with the Brown Daily Herald. We\u2019re excited to share a new admissions newsletter that will cover a variety of subjects. Last week, we covered how students wrote their essays, and this week we\u2019ll be covering test-optional. We\u2019re also hoping to cover video intros, financial aid and more! The stories will all have perspective both from current first-years and admission officers. You can sign up using the link below. Hope you\u2019ll check it out!\n\nhttps://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2021/11/the-supplement-how-brown-students-crafted-their-college-essays",

Even though their some limitations like the alternative brick decaying over time it\u2019s something I\u2019m still thinking about. \n\nSo what are some concentrations at brown to accomplish that. Ik that place is a lot but help me out",

You just literally take classes that you would otherwise take, and then have them count towards the \u201cspecialization.\u201d \n\nFor example, I did Visual Computing + the AI/ML pathway. It just happened to be that my interests lied in graphics, UIUX, game engines, AI, CV, etc. I then used those when finalizing my degree. There\u2019s nothing special about it; you just took the classes you wanted to, and then used them to satisfy the reqs.\n\nThe real thing that would be beneficial is your access to professors / research labs. There are a lot of cool things being worked on, and that\u2019s happening outside of class \u2014 no pathway will help you there. At Brown, it is very undergrad focused, and I have a bunch of friends who have been part of AI labs and done some cool research &amp; published papers. That\u2019s your real chance for what you\u2019re trying to do, not your classes.",

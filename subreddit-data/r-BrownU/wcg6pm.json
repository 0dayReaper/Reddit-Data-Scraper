    "postText": "I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why the bookstore does not sell any knit sweaters with a Brown \"B\" on them.  I know that several other Ivies (Yale, Dartmouth, Harvard) all offer such a product on their bookstore's website. Why is it that Brown does not? Maybe I am in the minority,  but I would surely like such an item. Does anyone have an idea why the bookstore does not carry these sweaters?\n\nI have attached links to the sweaters I am referring to above. \n\n[https://www.dartmouthcoop.com/dartmouth-d-sweater/](https://www.dartmouthcoop.com/dartmouth-d-sweater/)\n\n[https://www.theharvardshop.com/products/the-h-sweater-harvard-exclusive-pre-order?variant=32171364319292&amp;currency=USD&amp;utm\\_medium=product\\_sync&amp;utm\\_source=google&amp;utm\\_content=sag\\_organic&amp;utm\\_campaign=sag\\_organic&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwrZOXBhACEiwA0EoRD5SWK4UmKWD7q6cTJrsh9BH4ZhPq8v\\_JFzCzqbbZjOxw9wszx-gmQBoCyI0QAvD\\_BwE](https://www.theharvardshop.com/products/the-h-sweater-harvard-exclusive-pre-order?variant=32171364319292&amp;currency=USD&amp;utm_medium=product_sync&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_content=sag_organic&amp;utm_campaign=sag_organic&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwrZOXBhACEiwA0EoRD5SWK4UmKWD7q6cTJrsh9BH4ZhPq8v_JFzCzqbbZjOxw9wszx-gmQBoCyI0QAvD_BwE)\n\n[https://hillflint.com/products/yale-letter-sweater-creme](https://hillflint.com/products/yale-letter-sweater-creme)",

Maybe it\u2019s a fall/winter item? Or maybe the partnership with the brand fell through? There were two colorways, one brown with white \u2018B\u2019 and a cream one with brown \u2018B\u2019. They were pricey though, like $120",

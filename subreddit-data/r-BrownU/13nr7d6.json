I was wondering if any alumni or current students could speak about the program and their experience. Anything is helpful as I am first gen student and don\u2019t know much about graduate school and the processes to get there. Thanks!",

I think you have to be from the classes of 2022, 2018, or 2013 for this. Happy to compensate you for your time in addition to the ticket costs.~~\n\nMy partner is going to the reunion on Friday and I'd like to go with her... unfortunately, because I'm awful at logistical minutiae (read: I'm a walking disaster operating on three hours of sleep), I didn't realize that the online registration deadline was 5pm today rather than midnight and ended up missing the deadline by half an hour. My understanding is there's a decent chance that some events (e.g. the big dance and dinner party) will sell out before we get there in person on Friday and I'd rather not risk it. We're trying to sort things out (calling the office, reaching out to friends, etc.) but I'm asking here just in case.\n\nThanks!",

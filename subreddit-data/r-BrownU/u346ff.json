I originally was set on the former, but after looking at the course requirements the pure CS seems really interesting too.\n\nAny students in either that can vouch for one or the other?",

            "comment": "CS intermediates and APMA intro requirements are basically the same (Calc III, Linear Algebra, stats). Although it isn't a cs req, APMA0350 with Bjorn is widely considered a must take for stem majors, it's a brilliant introduction to differential equations. APMA0360 is hit or miss depending on the prof.\n\nFrom here I would take atleast 1 1000 level class to see if APMA-CS is for you. If you hate it, along with all the math classes up to this point, I recommend just going into pure CS and focusing on the systems/security/engineering tracks. \n\nSome 1000 classes I particularly liked:\n\nIf you like stats def recommend taking APMA1690, APMA1710, and APMA1740/2610.\n\nAPMA1860 with Nguyen is great, especially for CS majors.\n\nAPMA1160 with Darbon is a great class if you want to learn more about optimization algorithms and convex analysis (disclaimer, I'm thinking of TAing it so might be a bit biased).",

You\u2019re in a great place planning this already and I wish you the best of luck!",

            "comment": "You'll end up doing a lot of math on either track, but personally I believe that having proof of a strong math background is huge. Which one is \"right\" largely depends on what you want to do. Having the APMA half opens you up to a lot more work with modeling, and provides you with skills that are generally more desirable in industry (work such as soft/firmware development, but also finance, etc.). In pure CS a lot of what you learn in later courses is only truly applicable if you want to do research. \n\nIt's also worth noting that many people in pure CS that I know are extremely successful and landing internships with amazing companies, but are pursuing the AB option. Many of them got about halfway through the ScB requirements, recognized that they already had all the skills necessary for industry, and decided to spend more time learning about other things. Obviously I'm a little bit biased, but this is just my two cents.",

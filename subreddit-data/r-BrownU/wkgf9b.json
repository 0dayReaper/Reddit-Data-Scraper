            "comment": "Hi! There is very minimal math involved in the intro courses \u2014 if there is any math involved beyond the basic addition/subtraction/multiplication/division (ie, finding the average of something), you\u2019ll most likely be given a formula for it. For later courses (ie, CS1230, ML, etc), I\u2019ve heard that there\u2019s a bit of linear algebra involved, but for courses beyond the intro ones, you can pretty much pick &amp; choose what you want to take, so it\u2019s very doable to find courses that don\u2019t really involve math.",

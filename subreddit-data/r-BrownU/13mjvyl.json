    "postText": "hi guys! got accepted as a transfer at both and I'm super grateful! really torn between the 2. I'm planning on double concentrating in biology and econ. I'm definitely not 100% set on what I want to do in the future so I'd like to keep as many options open as possible.\n\nSome of the biggest pros of Upenn for me are the abundance of research, solid academic excellence, and internship opportunities. cons are its cutthroat, finance-oriented environment. brown's biggest appeal to me is the lack of general education requirements and a more collaborative environment, but I am worried that I won't have as many career opportunities. I was wondering if these assumptions were true.\n\nI think my ideal college experience is learning for the sake of learning/intellectual curiosity but also not being too idealistic. I do plan on working right after undergrad and potentially returning to grad school once I have solid savings. Any advice would be appreciated!",

            "comment": "Congratulations! Here is my pitch.\n\nYour assumptions at the surface level run true. UPenn\u2019s environment is much more cutthroat, there is significantly more on campus recruiting for some specific career pathways that allow placing into some industries to be more straightforward (think investment banking, investing).\n\nHowever, Brown likewise has an abundance of biology and biochemistry research available at the undergraduate level (thanks to its undergraduate focus) from some really strong researchers in their field. And similarly, outside of very niche Wharton Econ-bro finance classes, Brown offers the exact same courses UPenn does. So what is the difference then? Brown lets you choose how you want to direct your educational experience. How? Absolutely no gen-ed requirements, less concentration requirements, and less strict major pathways. This applies to both Econ and Biology. And by the way, this matters since coming in as a transfer you\u2019ll have less of a social support system at your next school and imo you\u2019ll want the opportunity to \u201cmake up\u201d for a lost year without stressing how you\u2019re going to fit in a double major in 3 years.\n\nYou can browse my recent comments on the other transfer threads and I\u2019ll say it here again. Brown in no way limits you from getting a top job in whatever field you pursue. People in every industry (par high finance) largely look at the schools as equivalents for recruiting purposes. You should as well.\n\nTo summarize, Brown has a sizable transfer cohort that really lets you hit the ground running socially. Brown will not shortchange you in terms of industry/grad school placement, and it will be much more feasible to fit in a double major in 3 years while exploring other areas. Likewise, research and \u201cacademic excellence \u201c opportunities should be the basis of your decision.\n\nWith that said, go where you think you\u2019ll be happiest. Do you want to be in Philly with a large undergrad that has social systems largely divided into Greek life / major / etc? Do you want to be in Providence with a more intimate undergrad which has a strong transfer network and a very collaborative student body + a social ecosystem that really can be what you make of it. The answer here should be your decision. Best of luck!",

Centipedes crawling in your room? Sewage flooding your first floor? Wholesomeness love from the student body? Spill the tea :)",

            "comment": "Not really things you can't miss but random experience that I still think of Brown after graduation\n\n\\- Spot a random acapella performance at night\n\n\\- Swear to yourself you're getting an uber up college hill the next time after walking uphill from the train station with luggages (Yes Brown is on a hill, it's called College Hill for a reason)\n\n\\- Spot a drone flying in front of the CIT (There's a small robotic class that teaches you to program drones, if you're lucky they'll be testing in front of the CIT)\n\n\\- Go to the Taiwanese Night Market in and fill your stomach with asian food you haven't heard of before (The Taiwanese Night Market usually held some time in the Fall in Sayles)\n\n\\- Visit someone who lives in 257 and wish you could live in a place like this if you go off-campus. (Bonus if you find out the price and ... back to Brown-owned dorm)\n\n\\- Get lost in Barus and Holley. (The building is not really that big but well, it's confusing for most freshmen at least)\n\n\\- Say hi to the axolotl on Scili 3rd floor (Haven't visited him since the pandemic started, can't even remember his name, can someone please tell me he's doing well)\n\n\\- Go to Chicken Finger Friday and left disappointed. (It's more of a meme at this point)\n\n\\- Contemplate living in Perkins before the housing lottery for a solid 5 minutes, weighting between the fact that you will be living VERY FAR from campus and that fact that you won't have to worry about the housing lottery anymore.\n\n\\- Take a bus (the bus is free for Brown students) to New Port and enjoy time with your friends\n\n\\- The Freshman Walmart trip and getting things you don't actually need :) \n\n\\- Eat at every restaurants on Thayer\n\n\\- Suffer from a CS course \n\nand the list goes on",

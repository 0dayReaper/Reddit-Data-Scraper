            "comment": "Genuinely Brown is a better undergraduate experience over all. Harvard has a metric tonne of graduate schools that take away from the undergrads. Your engagement with Professors at Brown is unmatched. Every Professor at Brown is required to teach an undergraduate class in a period (I am unsure what the period is, but I believe it\u2019s every year or two years). This means med school professors will still regularly teach undergrads. Harvard has no such policy. A lot of highly specialized and notable professors will simply just teach graduate students ex. Poli sci profs teach at the Kennedy school, bio profs teach at Harvard Med, Econ profs teach at the Business school. At Brown, professors like Ken Miller(bio super star, probably wrote your high school bio text book) and Andy Van Dam (computer science, invented the hyperlink, pioneered animation, Andy from Toy Story named after him, second person ever to get a PH.D in Computer Science) both teach the intro classes for their departments along with upper level undergrad classes. This set up is very unique in the world. Professors come to Brown knowing it\u2019s an undergrad focused school.",

            "comment": "I was choosing between Brown and Harvard back in 2017 and it was a really difficult decision for me, but here's why I ended up choosing Brown in the end:\n\n1. The people at Brown are incredibly open and friendly, and coming from a competitive high school Brown was the perfect environment for me to stop just caring about being a good student and start caring about being a good person and a good friend.\n\n2. The focus on undergraduate experience and teaching at Brown is incomparable. Brown has one of the smallest graduate schools out of \"top\" schools, and it really shows in the way that professors care about quality of teaching for undergrad classes as well as access to things like research opportunities and general mentorship. My favorite class at Brown was one where a professor just decided to create a seminar based on a niche topic that my friend and I were interested in, and I learned way more in this two person class where everyone involved was super passionate than in a dozen lecture courses. \n\n3. Harvard didn't admit me",

Most graduate programs equate Brown and Harvard in terms of education quality (IE no doors will be closed for a Brown grad that would be open for a Harvard grad). Computer science, tech and finance firms recruit heavily at both places. If you want to do NGO work abroad, though, Harvard definitely has more of the \u201chousehold name\u201d kind of prestige going for it. Most people in the USA will recognize Brown as an top-tier school, but literally everyone knows of Harvard.",

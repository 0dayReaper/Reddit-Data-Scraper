I remember it being a nice, sweet manga/webcomic, though like I said, I started reading it almost back when it started \u2014 must've been 2013-2014. I caught up to the latest chapter at the time, and as it typically happens with some of the manga I read, I forget about it/don't continue reading them for a while, unless they really, really grab me and I keep reading or well, they're finished already and I read them to completion.\n\nIt's kinda funny now that I think about it. I'm 28 now, same age as the MC. Back when the manga started in 2013, I was in my last year of high school. It's a little bit melancholic.",

After a while, Oga got to know about the relife program and started working with Kaizaki which in turn, let Kaizaki meet with Rena again. It all concludes with Oga and Rena inviting Kaizaki to their wedding since they are friends again. As a side note, Oga still doesn't know that Kaizaki was part of the program but he could find out because the files for Kaizaki are still there.!&lt;",

At your age?\n\nFeels like I threw my entire life goals away because my traumas and PTSD finally caught up with me around 23 and I have been struggling so hard trying to recover to get on track. \n\nEach day that passes I grow more and more lost and restless that I have achieved a grand total of nothing in life and I'm not a young person anymore. It feels like I wasted the sliver of opportunity I had when deciding to take my life more seriously at 17 and work towards college. \n\nTime is inevitably going by and leaving me and my aspirations behind.",

A good story resonates much deeper than just \"do x or y\" ever will. \n\nI'm 28 and I can say I've had similar thoughts. Just my 2 cents, but I don't think you ever \"know\" for certain if you're on the right path, but certainly talk with some family or friends to let them know how you might be feeling. Everyone's life path is different, so don't let it get you down if everything isn't immediately in place. \n\nI don't mean to address this specifically to you, just maybe some general advice for anyone reading this.",

It wasn't one day, one moment, or usually even one person that is responsible for where you are. It's a culmination of everything informing where you are headed at any particular moment in life, and sufficient time for that vector to play out.\n\nAll that to say, you almost always have some control over your trajectory. You can choose today to be the day that you start preparing your future self to be in a better position than your current self. Whether that's not eating that one extra cookie, actually submitting that job application, or just messaging your best bud that you haven't talked to in waaaaay too long. \n\nWe are all a multitude of factors, conditions, and our own will. So exert what control you do have over this world and take the initiative when you can.\n\nI'm just rambling so I'll end with a quote I like that's semi-related; \"if not us, who? And if not now, when?\" You are the master of your fate and today will never be tomorrow.",

This is how you improve. \n\n&gt; You can choose today to be the day that you start preparing your future self to be in a better position than your current self\n\nThis can be literally anything at any amount above zero. Take one step towards your goals. Whatever it is - eating less, working out, developing a skill, do *something*. Whatever it is, it's enough. Wanna learn drums? Get a practice pad (seriously, worth) and practice paradiddles for a minute. That is one minute more practice than you had before. *That is a victory.*\n\nThe brain has this fascinating set of circuitry that's constantly doing cost-benefit analyses on any decisions you're making. It's checking a buncha factors - including your past experiences - and deciding whether or not something's worth your effort. This is what ends up saying \"why bother? look how it turned out last time\" or \"this isn't enough to hit your target\" or \"you need to also be doing Y and Z in addition to X\" and all of that is self-sabotaging *bullshit*.\n\nYour brain is an organ like anything else, it's not factoring your goals or wants in its analysis, it's just trying to get chemicals. You can't rely on \"I feel/don't feel like it today\" to decide if you're gonna do something, because you're never gonna do it. You gotta catch when your head's trying to dissuade you from what you truly want, saying you should just play video games or scroll tiktok or whatever. Understanding that is the seed of discipline.\n\nAny step is enough. Even one step is a victory. One step aligns you closer to your ideal. Enough victories builds momentum, and momentum is what makes it easier. \n\nIt all sounds like patronizing bullshit if you're in a depressive mindset. Even a year ago I would have read this, go \"lmao this dude makes it sound so fucking easy\", downvote, scroll on. I've been a depressed shut-in for 15 years, I've attempted to end my life twice, I was by all accounts a failure. I know where a lotta folks here are coming from, I've been there. It ain't easy, but this depressive mindset *will not go away on its own.* You need to want to *want* to change, and then you'll find that you can take that step.",

Got a job, got promos, got raises, still felt like shit. There's something else that's causing your feeling.\n\nRealistically, \"get a job\" is just a step or a requirement to survive in our world. It's an external thing. If you didn't *need* a job to survive or fund your goals, you probably wouldn't bother, right? \n\nThe reasons behind why you feel this way are specific to you. For me it was because I felt like I wasn't meeting societal expectations &amp; I was comparing myself to others.\n\nComparing yourself to others is one of the tricks your brain tries to pull on you when it's telling you not to bother trying something. It does nothing useful here, because there's way too many variables that factored into where others are at, including the shit they don't let you see. \n\nRealistically you gotta sit and think on why it is you feel like this. What is it that makes you feel that shame? Is it something that's coming from outside, from societal or parental or spousal expectations? Is it something that really means something to *you*? \n\nThere's a whole lot of us that are so intrinsically tied into constant dopamine fixes - video games, TV, youtube, jerking off, whatever - we don't give ourselves time to think about what's really important to us. We get sad over something and instead of thinking about what we can do better, we load up a game or scroll Reddit or order some food to force us to not feel that feeling. That's a whole other (and also super fascinating) brain circuit that's designed around what the brain wants to do and not what *we*, the person, the culmination of our thoughts and experiences and expressions in this world, want. \n\nNext time you feel like a loser, you get the tightness in your chest or the urge to cry or however it manifests for you, sit and walk through *why*. Don't run from it. You don't have to go through specific steps or try to reason with yourself why you're not a loser or whatever, you just gotta sit and *exist* while you feel that shit. It sounds dumb. I promise you from the depths of my soul that it will help in time. But you gotta sit with it, and not say 'fuck this' and go play a game, or you'll get nowhere.\n\nThis is one of the fundamental concepts behind therapy, really. It's literally a space that you carve out of your schedule to sit and just think about shit, ideally without being distracted by something else. In general, therapy can be super good, because a good therapist or psychiatrist or whatever ought to be able to identify the specific roadblocks you're facing and give you guidance on how to move past those.\n\nWhatever you do, however you feel about anything I've said, take a step. Any step towards the version of you that you want to be. It's okay if you miss a day. It's cool if you miss a few. But when you think about \"man I really oughta do that...\" fucking *do* it. Either do it, or make it even one iota of progress towards it. It's the only good way out.",

One thing I learned while studying to get a public job is that you have to put in the effort *first*, when you're totally **not** feeling like it, and you'll get the motivation to do it *after* you've started. Not before.\n\nThey say the most important step a person can take is not the first nor the last, it's the next one. Always the next one. I can assure you though, that the **hardest** step to take is always the first one. So force yourself to take the first step. You might need to force yourself to take the second step, too. But I guarantee you, each new step will be easier and easier to take.\n\nEventually, stopping is going to be the hard thing to do. Seriously.",

But my whole school carreer was a slow downhill slide. My grades got worse through middle school, and through High School i started failing classes, sometimes even subjects I was really good at. I survived high school, and tried going to community college, but failed at that too and now I work part time at a minimum wage retail job pushing shopping carts and live with my parents.\n\n...Is where the story would have ended 10 years ago. Since then I've gone back to college, earned a degree, become fluent in Japanese, and moved to Japan for work. \n\nThis didn't happen in spite of my time working retail, it happened precicely because of those experiences. They helped me to learn and grow, even though at the time I felt frozen in place. No matter where you're at, you can always get back on track. Maybe not the one you envisioned when you were a kid, but theres lots of good tracks out there waiting to be found.",

I saw Elfen Lied in a place in my life where I was very much NOT ok. I was a very broken person in a very fucked up and terrible place in my life. But that exposure was ultimately what lead to me facing a lot of my own demons and challenges and denial about myself, and turning around and trying to heal and become a better person. But I have never really forgotten the emotional scars it left behind.\n\nA Silent Voice hit me in a lot of the same memories but I was in a much safer place in life and had already processed through and healed through many things thanks to EL.\n\nNone the less A Silent Voice hit deep where it hurt and it became a very special film for me.\n\nI think both need to be experienced at the right time, or they can really REALLY fuck you up.",

It's an absolute wish fulfillment fantasy. \n\nAnd a lot of times that's a really weak way to write things and is considered almost always really poor writing.\n\nBut A Silent Voice takes this and absolutely turns it around and makes it exactly what someone who went through that kind of bullying needed to see.\n\nSeeing the way people's lives were turned upside down, and all the real reasons for regret and remorse, it pulled at some of the most painfully deep and scarred parts of my own experiences. \n\nIt's exactly in the same vein of reason why Elfen Lied hit so fucking hard for me. This situation in Elfen Lied, the last episode does this between Parent and Child. With Mariko and Kurama, that last few scenes between them on the island. It pulls at the deepest parts of the pain of still desperately loving your parent, despite that parent being the very reason you suffered for so many ears of your life in utter misery.\n\nThose scenes are what broke me. That monolog Mariko makes towards her father, and the way he actually takes the blame, and means to change, that is what shattered who I was as a person and forced me to took at my life's experiences unfiltered in a way I couldn't escape. \n\nI love both for exactly the same reason, they fact they pulled at the most deeply painful emotions people can really suffer through in their interpersonal relationships, and pulls out what someone who went through that needs to see and hear.\n\nThey both have moments that cut deep, and bring out the moment that needs to happen so people can start heal and move on.\n\nThat's why both are so precious to me.",

I was the quiet kid in my class, didn't really talk to anyone, always kept to myself, did enough in school to get average grades, stuff like that.\n\nNow I'm an adult and have to *socialize* with people at work. Let's just say I'm dogshit at maintaining a conversation, but I'm getting better. Getting out of your comfort zone helps, as horrifying as it seems.\n\nI still think I've missed out on a lot, and wasted time. There are a lot of things I enjoy, but never actually did much with it. For instance, I enjoy music and drawing whenever I listen to it or do it, but I never actually did anything with those interests, or many others I had. In hindsight, I think my consumption of video games might've been an escape, a coping mechanism I unknowingly adopted to distract myself from the feelings of loneliness.\n\nI loathe that regret. I loathe the feelings. I despise it.\n\nReflecting on it, I've realised that it's pointless feeling and thinking like that. Thinking \"*what if I did this*\", and \"*if only I did that.*\" It's pointless and a waste of time.\n\nOne day, I signed up for a music school. I bought a drawing tablet. The best time to start with your interests is now. Gatekeepers will be gatekeepers, but the ones who are truly passionate about their craft would be absolutely delighted to give tips to even a 90 year old man just starting out.\n\nI know you have interests, I know there are things you enjoy. You don't need to become Picasso, you don't need to be Bach. You just need to be *you*. Fuck the people who say \"*You stop learning at 30*\". How the fuck do you think my 40+ year old parents learned another language?\n\nThis also applies to anyone who reads this, not just the one I'm replying to. It's okay to fail, just get back up and try again. Allow yourself to fail, because that's how you get better.\n\n**And perhaps most importantly;** *have fun*. Life's too short to lament missed opportunities.",

The link between transgender identities and autism's pretty well-established scientifically, although no one quite knows why. I think part of it is that we're just more likely to figure out we're trans. We might be a bit better at seeing how arbitrary gender roles are, because all social conventions tend to look arbitrary to us. Or maybe our reduced ability to filter sensory input makes gender dysphoria harder to ignore. Who knows, really.\n\nAs for the mental health though, well, I for one think that stubbornly trying to be entirely the wrong person for 20+ years just messed me up a little.",

Granted, right now I'm working for a damn call center.\n\n Currently I'm in consideration for an internal promotional position that probably pays a little better than $14/h. In the meantime I'm also in consideration for another job that while in the grand scheme of things doesn't pay much, is a dream job of mine.\n\nWhile college certainly isn't for everyone, and there are many, *many* people who make a killing without need for an education, it certainly does help to have that piece of paper open more doors for you.

I'm 33 years old and was a shut in with massive anxiety for almost my entire life. Never went to grade school or anything, so didn't know how to do simple things like divide or multiply. Never held someone's hand, never had a job, basically was waiting to die and rotting away in a filthy room while playing video games all day to distract myself from the constant panic attacks I was having. Panicked when I turned 30 and realized I wasted my youth, got off my ass, got my GED after taking classes for it in the dingy basement of a public library, and just got my Associate's of Science on May 1st of this year after graduating with high honors (3.8 GPA). First job was being the college's tutor for aspiring nurses and radiology technicians struggling with anatomy and physiology! I also just found out that I'm getting a full academic scholarship to a college across the country to study molecular biology, so I'm finally moving out of my mom's house and going somewhere where I don't know anyone and can have a fresh start. It's terrifying, but I'm so incredibly excited.\n\nSeriously, you reading this. If I was able to make a change, you can! It doesn't matter your age, income, or anything like that.

Every job application rejection, every turned down love confession, every single \u201cfailure\u201d you\u2019ve experienced is just a stepping stone on your path in life. Life is a struggle, but you can bring meaning to it yourself. Take a walk outside and just enjoy the fact that God (or the universe or whatever you believe in) decided to put you here at this exact moment in time with near unlimited resources at your fingertips. \n\nIs your room messy? Start by deciding to clean one spot and go from there. Take it one piece at a time. Jobless? Start putting in applications. You\u2019ve been rejected a bunch? It\u2019s gonna sound like a boomer take, but go to your closest fast food place and ask the manager for a job. They\u2019re so short staffed. Start saving from there. You may not be a millionaire and it\u2019s gonna suck, but having a job and making money after being a shut-in loser is gonna bring you fulfillment in life and with that experience better job opportunities. Can\u2019t find a lover? Just focus on improving yourself and YOUR life and it\u2019ll work itself out. No one is gonna want to be lovers with a loser who can\u2019t get their life together. Even if you don\u2019t end up finding a companion, you can take pride in the fact that you have improved TREMENDOUSLY from today. \n\nLife isn\u2019t a straight path. There\u2019s twist and turns and sometimes you get taken off the path completely. But if you struggle enough and focus on improving yourself, you will eventually find your way back. It may not be the exact trajectory you planned, but you\u2019ll be alive and you can take pride in the fact that YOU carved your own path. \n\nNihilism isn\u2019t cool. It\u2019s just a coping mechanism for losers. Life can be beautiful, but YOU have to find it.",

I'm really anxious and terrified that things will not go well and.... I become a failure. Unable to keep my family, teacher, and classmates expectations. Failed to be the person they and I can be proud of.\n\nThanks, this is a great way to worsen my anxiety.\n\nOh have I mentioned that I'm almost in my last year and I still don't know what career path I want to do?",

But after reading this, it straight up made me cry\u2026 all I can now think about is how I feel like I let myself down and never moved forward from the rut of a basic job. I\u2019m 28 and I still have yet to find a career and life that I would personally see as successful. To my younger self.. my dude\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry! There has been so much potential I could have had over the years but it feels like I let those slip out of my hands without even attempting at gripping it. I hope you can forgive me, my younger self.. I still want to show you that I can still be the person I strive to be. It may not be the same, but I still hope to make you proud!",

This is an indirect message to me, and to anybody who think of surrendering, don't do it, you are far more strong thank you think and if you try with intent, real intent, you will accomplish what you would never have bilieved! english is not my first language, so if there is any mistakes i'm sorry, but i hope i've been clear!

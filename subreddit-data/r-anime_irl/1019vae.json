So it doesn't just stop them from reproducing, it also makes them not go batshit crazy and piss on everything during mating season.\n\nWhich *is* a good thing, if you've ever seen a cat in heat without an... outlet.",

But then I asked if she had gotten the cat spayed and the answer was No. I knew that wasn't a great thing and was kinda like \"Wtf friend, why didn't you get that done?\" However, since I was trying to help my friend out, I took her cat in. It couldn't be *that* bad, right?\n\nWrong. Whenever the cat was in heat, she'd shit all over the place. On the carpet, on the couch, even on my bed once. Then of course there was the yowling and hissing and constant \"presenting.\" She'd do that for like a week or so, then be fine again for a bit, then be back in heat for several more days or longer. The full cycle could be up to 6 weeks.\n\nShe was a nightmare (plus she was also a poorly socialized cat). I had to give her up, unfortunately. My friend lied to me when I told her about her cat shitting around when in heat. \"Oh that's never happened before with me!\" But then her husband told me the truth, that he'd dealt with cat shit in the bed more than once.\n\nMy current cat I adopted as a kitten and they neutered him at the shelter, thank god.",

All this \"it's healthful\" crap when in reality it's just more convenient for owners to have them neutered.\n\nAlso it's not \"human insecurity\" to imagine you wouldn't want to be neutered if you were a cat, it's empathy.",

Or, as an extreme measure to avoid having kids). It does lead you to have lower testosterone levels (but your body still produces some, even without them), which regulates quite a lot of your body, ranging from normal muscle development, to your sexual life, and to psychological issues. \n\nAnd, if I recall correctly, most of the time, the body tries keeping the hormones balanced, if your testosterone goes down (or up), it's counterparts tend to go down (or up) alongside it. (I have heard of many cases where body builders took too many testosterone supplements and started developing some feminine features). In the end, some stuff would be more dulled, but that should be the extent of it, at least physiologically (no idea about the extent of psychological issues, since these usually depend on the person).\n\nAlso of note that people undergoing HRT (Hormone Replacement Treatment), usually also take hormone blockers to stop the body from trying to produce the normal hormones to balance it back to normal.\n\nPS: During a re-read to make sure my message makes sense, I realized that you might as well take testosterone supplements to go back to normal hormonal levels after having them taken out.\n\n\nTL;DR: Body likes to Balance hormones. Some things would be more dull. You can take supplements to fix the testosterone levels.",

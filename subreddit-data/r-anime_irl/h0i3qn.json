There was some backlash against CliffsNotes, as school students wouldn't actually read the books they were assigned to read, and instead would just read the CliffsNotes for the book instead. I.e. they read summaries of what happens and notes on things like theme, background info, etc, rather than reading the book and figuring those things out. Looking up info on the internet is basically the modern version of reading the CliffsNotes.",

                    "comment": "It's actually a ridiculously complex, well-written book and I personally interpret it as Nabokov making a statement on how people view the past, especially Americans.\n\nHumbert Humbert's pedophilia is based around his own recollections of the past, where his memories of his first love and all the good feelings he has around his childhood overall is twisted more and more to eventually be used to justify his disgusting actions. When you pair that with Humbert's manipulation of Dolores' mother by playing the \"European gentleman\", I think Nabokov was trying to convey his own disdain (?) at how much people fetishize history to justify cruel and abhorrent behaviors and thoughts. The European-American aspect of the story further builds into the more specific kind of American fetishization of European ancestry, where the \"old\" and \"historic\" is intertwined with \"European\" and turning the \"idea\" of European culture and history into an ideal that is ultimately used for less than ideal purposes.\n\nGiven Nabokov's history, fleeing from Russia to Germany in the revolution, then fleeing from the Nazis to America, I think the immigrant/emigrant perspective was a factor in Nabokov's writing Lolita and a theme of the fetishization of the past is not too far-fetched of an interpretation.\n\nOf course, none of that could be true, and the story would still be fascinating at face value as a story of a pedophile. Humbert Humbert is a horrible person and the book does not try to hide it. Humbert may never describe himself as such and he has fancy things to say about himself and his desires, but the things he does alone does nothing to portray him as sympathetic. As just a character study on how horrible people deceive themselves and others to paint themselves as \"normal\" upstanding citizens, Lolita is still worth a read.",

This is the same sort of argument used to attack video games for making children violent.  The main difference is that one type of enjoyment is sexual and one is platonic, but to claim that this difference is enough to completely override someone's distinction between real and fake is... yeah.",

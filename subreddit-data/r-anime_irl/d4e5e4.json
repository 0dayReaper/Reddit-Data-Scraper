Thats literally it, they will probably invite you to be polite at first but just try and share common interests and you'll be friends in no time.\n\nIn college? Even easier, go to events and shit. I know at my university there were straight up social communication groups dedicated to people making friends to go out and do stuff. Gotta find clubs and people you can hang out with.\n\nJob time? Up in the air, hardest one because some people don't like their jobs and refuse to socialize. In this situation you gotta find someone your working besides on work days. Strike up small talk, invite them out to drink or whatever you like doing. The secret weapon at jobs is barbeques, holding a feast for free food? Hell yeah man people will show up. It gives you and other people an opportunity to mingle.\n\nAll this invalid if you dont like going out much tho, I feel you on that one.",

I isolated myself from all my friends away because I was filled with anxiety, and paranoia as I believed that they didn't like me. But all this time away from them gave me time to reflect and learn a lot about myself outside of the influence they had on me everyday. So take your time in solitude to grow and reflect on what you could have done better with your friends and learn some more about who you are without them.\n\nI don't plan to rekindle my friendship, but if it's possible for you then I'd try to reconnect with them once you feel you're ready. I'm not entirely familiar with your situation, so I've got no idea if any of this is applicable but I figured I'd put this out there.",

Friend requests? Someone said something in a random channel? Your friend perosnally DM'ing you? Some fucking bullshit offer? Everything. It's a totally useless indication for attention.\n\nAnd there's SO LITTLE to change about it.\n\nYeah you can mute notifications but it doesn't change the fact that the notification icon on different channels lights up with that grey or red icon with no indication wtf it's trying to get your attention for. Even if someone @'s you directly, it's fucking aids to figure out WHERE someone @'d you to boot. It'd be nice if there was some feature that let you jump to directly where you were mentioned without wrangling with the search feature.\n\nDiscord literally may as well not have any notification feature and fucking nothing would change.",

(side note after thought animation was invented in america actually i think so i guess i am wrong in ways) \n\n I also think how anime and wrestling can be similar in ways: The weekly structure of new episodes/content, the seasons/arcs of stories being told in an ongoing way. Maybe wrestling catching on is also due to the existence/commonality of physical sports judo karate and sumo. Boxing and MMA was popular in america before the pro/televised wrestling became popular. \n\nLike also how our animation shows have been inspired and use ideas from anime, japan has also taken and developed it's own wrestling. and that has both send back and forth changing each other",

The main character's actions are kinda funny just on the basis of his personality, but it's the standard comedy setup with quick one-off jokes based on the character archetypes. It's nothing revolutionary. I'd say watch it for the first two - three episodes and if you don't really really like it you likely won't enjoy the rest.",

For one [mangadex.org](https://mangadex.org) does not allow official translations (so one less legal trouble), every translation is done by a person or a group which is already not *explicitly* approved by the original creator. So scanlation in it's entirety is a grey area. Mangadex also complies to the author/publishers wishes, so if they're asked to take down a scanlated work, they do it (MHA isn't on there for example).\n\nAnd as a side note, you aren't totally bombarded by adds and they link to official translations if they exist online. It's one of the better sites out there to read mangas.",

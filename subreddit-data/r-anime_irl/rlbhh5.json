If there isn't more content they can just slide it further. Studios generally have more power atm, they don't really need to rely on forcing one property to stay relevant.\n\nFiller really only gets added when the studio figures out that they need to pad a cour with a few episodes if the arc isn't long enough. The only shows that still run off with full filler arcs this are the ones that have already been running that way for the last 20 years.",

But people are fine with it because as you watch, and especially on rewatch, you can just skip the filler episodes. The canon episodes run at good pace. So filler is annoying at the time but is better for the anime overall.\n\nCompared to One Piece who haven't done filler arcs for years, instead choosing to drag everything out. 10 second reaction shots, painstakingly slow pans and transitions, attacks that last minutes but should be over in a second. It means it's hard even on rewatches unless you wanna watch on 4x speed. \n\nIf they continued doing filler arcs between canon ones like they used to (see the much enjoyed G8 arc), they'd be able to adapt the canon stuff at a good pace and improve the anime overall.",

So the first episodes and character development are much more fleshed out in the original. It\u2019s better to watch in chronological order, I\u2019d never tell people to watch Brotherhood first. Watch the original, you get to enjoy it and be introduced properly, then when it\u2019s over you get to relive the entire series again, but better, and accurate to the manga this time. So you get to experience it twice in the best way each time. Also, [Bratja](https://youtu.be/uwzAEwzUI8k) is not in Brotherhood.",

Brotherhood just felt like a new exploration of the FMA story. \n\nThis was before I knew about manga, or how to read it other than going to Barnes and Noble. But I didn't care about the character development in Brotherhood, because I had been exposed to FMA already. That made the pace of the show feel great, since it really got down to a lot of the heavy plot points much quicker than the earlier adaption.",

The way it all ended was just as much of a punishment for Ed as what happened in the 2009 show. The darker tone and the villain were also more grounded (as grounded as a series like FMA can be) and more relatable. Dante was the dark, evil version of Ed. An alchemist that forsook the world and only cares about herself. The exact opposite mindset that Ed always had about his use of alchemy. Dante even managed to break Ed's faith in the idea of Equivalent Exchange. But he was able to regain his trust in the idea of Equivalent Exchange and even add to it by the very end after dealing with her. Al too. They both grew a lot in that series.",

Brotherhood wrapped things up nicely for most characters, but it's such a cliche \"good guys win, protag gets the girl\" ending. While Brotherhood's ending is better, it's not remarkably better such that I prefer the original as a whole.",

If they don't think they could make a faithful adaptation then they know they're in for a huge backlash...like last time lol. \n\nAdd that to the fact that it's an incredibly detailed and gory manga which means cost wise it would probably need to be CGI again. And on top of that all of the violence and sexual content probably would be a nightmare for working with censors. So yeah,  I can understand why it would be unappealing from a studio's perspective, but I still want it to happen so bad",

Afterwards, sure, if the series get famous, they might get a bigger team, use better tools to draw, etc.\n\nAlso it depends a lot on how the material is adapted. If you use 10 manga chapters for one anime episode, obviously your source material will run out. If you use 0.5 manga chapters for one anime episode, you will get to where One Piece is now, with 10 minute episodes lol(the rest of it is a 5 min recap, 5 min for OP and ED)",

The DoroHedoro anime adaptation used CG in the vast majority of it's shots and was still well-received by viewers with it's most harsh reviews still deeming it \"just ok\".\n\nWhile i doubt we will have every part adapted by say, 2025, i can still see the part 8 anime being announced in early 2028 and ending by late 2028 or early 2029.",

But the manga is what it is and it will remain as such, if you change it it wont be the same manga, therefore, there are other works out there.\n\nWith this im not trying to be belligerent or anything, just pointing out that theres times for trash, theres times for cliches, theres times for those deep brain-scraping works that blow your mind",

The his role got taken over by that other narrator and he lost such (un-official) powers of understanding and was left as a more generic rom-com protagonist.",

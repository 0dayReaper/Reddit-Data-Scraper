Oviposition is the act of eggs being laid via an ovipositor. An ovipositor is a birth organ, for, well, laying eggs! It's mostly insects that have and use them. Some use them to carefully lay eggs under their bodies on plants, others may use them to lay eggs in a different insect/animal. \n\nThe fetish aspect of it would be having eggs laid in you. Typically anally or vaginally. You may then expel them or hold them for some time before laying them. There are sex toys for this purpose and there is quite a bit of overlap into the furry community, as there is quite a bit of anthropomorphic art of insects tied to this fetish.\n\nEDIT: I don't have this specific fetish, so if anything is inaccurate, that's probably why.",

Spent a few months on it watching videos on youtube/looking up guides/overviews on deviantart. I know its not an immediate thing but the fact that I made no progress at all and still draw like a toddler just kinda demoralized me and made me stop. I still have everything but it was just frustrating that I can't even do the basics. \n\nI feel like you have to have SOME beginner talent at least. My mom could always draw/ paint. Hell she painted our childhood toyroom by hand and had sesame street characters from ceiling to floorboard on the walls and a giant hot air balloon. It was actually amazing looking back at it. She never had training or practiced, never really ever drew on her own. She was just talented, wish I could have got even an ounce of that heh. \n\nI'll give it another shot at some point probably...",

I've always wanted to learn how to draw, reached my mid-20s, bought a lot of books and stuff to try to learn. Nothing stuck, never improved, got demotivated, stopped trying. I kept coming back though, it took me about a year of on and off practice before I finally got past that beginning hurdle, which is the hardest part.\n\nMy recommendation, put the tablet aside for now and stick with pen and paper. The skills you develop will transfer over, and you don't need to be trying to learn a computer program like Photoshop on top of learning the fundamentals. Speaking of the fundamentals, [this is the course](https://www.evolveyourart.com/beast) that finally made everything click for me. Everyone learns different ways but I've gone through a lot of books and courses and this is the only one that I actually stuck to and made progress with. It's not free, but its worth the money imo.\n\nAt the end of the day, the only person who can put in the work to learning how to draw is you. It is a long, difficult, frustrating, and grueling process to get good. But it is immensely rewarding and satisfying. To make the process less lonely, come join the [DrawABox](https://drawabox.com/) discord channel (I tried, and didn't like the DAB course, but its still worth checking out if you haven't already, ymmv). I recommend the discord because it is very relaxed, supportive, and without any dumb bullshit that other art discords are plagued with. It's just people silently posting art.",

When you watch vids at first you'll probes be like \"how the fuck did they just do that\", the answer is practice. If you just draw whatever you want you will never really be good, you will just end up on deviantart with no following. \n\nIf you want to actually be good then learn the fundaments first. These would be Human Anatomy, Perspective, Composition, Colour theory, line weight etc. Learn traditional art (pen and paper) before digital, if you go straight to digital you don't learn some of the fundamentals. \n\nI've heard like a million people say they want to learn to draw, but the amount of people who can actually keep up with it and become good is &gt;1% tbh. Art is very hard and frustrating, especially at first. most people just give up. Unless youre super passionate about art you kinda need someone to force you to improve, thats why art school is good.",

I know throughout most of my time growing up, trusting people online was rare and being comfortable sending money online was even rarer, short of some big retailers. I'm talking about overall social acceptance in this case. \n\nBut now, it's barely a second thought for most. It's really crazy to see.

Anime is a style, so you need to know the rules of anatomy and form and stuff before you can 'break' them or know when a shortcut can happen. If you learn traditional or \"realistic\" art you will just become better at anime style.  \n\n\nAlso, guess what? Nobody makes money with traditional art either. It just gives you skills to be more versatile later one with.. whatever you want to do later. Artists in general don't make much money, sure, but can you tell me an industry that IS doing well these days? The field is competitive but there is ALWAYS a demand for a good artist, and as long as you're putting in effort you WILL eventually find a place for your particular skills and talents.   \n\n\nsorry, long post, rant over.",

            "comment": "To be honest I still agree with some art teachers, the good ones at least. Anime is a style but the teachers want you to learn realism first. \n\nStyle is a method of breaking down and simplifying the rules of realism. Without knowledge of the rules, your figures and proportions will be ill and make your overall drawing look pretty gross. But art teachers usually don't say all that, they just say \"don't draw anime\".\n\n Another thing that kinda upsets me about this whole thing is that most of the students around me who drew anime, had zero clue about how to draw anime, so all the faces were all just triangle and looked bizarre. I know I'm being harsh on them but it's still something that shouldn't be done. Even artists in Japan who draw anime professionally learn realism first to understand these rules. \n\n(If you wanted to know how their art looked like, just look up \"Kids draw Big book of everything manga by Christopher Hart\". So imagine that with upside down triangle heads and broken proportions.)\n\nIn the end of the day, anime definitely has a market, but in art school, they are equipping you with the simple skills of art to be able to learn how to draw those styles.",

If you get work drawing in that style, whether inside or outside of Japan, all the more power to you. Kudos! Seriously!\n\nBut when you're working on Corporate work in the US, it's not a popular look. And if that's what you grew up drawing because you loved anime and practiced that style, it's difficult to draw a more-western style. Very soft, rounded, rather PBS cartoony.\n\nGalderma, Audi, NYF, WB Interactive Entertainment, BMW, GE Healthcare, etc... I've sat in on a lot of meetings with clients and supervisors where they're looking over artist portfolios and they immediately pass on anything remotely Japanese. Whether it's racism or personal tastes, that's a debate for another time...\n\nDon't give up just because you love that style and that's how you're learning to draw, shade, color, etc. Just be aware that if you want to get hired doing artist work in Corporate USA, *PLEASE* also diversify and learn how to emulate purely western cartoon styles. Or even better, your own unique style. It's going to give you much better chances of being hired.",

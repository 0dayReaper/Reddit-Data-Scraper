Once she started being overtly direct my stupid insecure young self thought it was a mean joke... Young me was bad at this.\n\nWe ended up dating a couple years later.  I remembered that night at the park and slightly older but still young me decided to ask her if she was being serious back then.  While we we dating.  \n\nThe look I got was like a physical blow.\n\nWe broke up and are still pretty good friends.  There's been multiple times when I've been this stupidly dense and she's whacked me upside the head and told me I'm being dumb.  Because apparently old me never learned from young me and needs that help regularly lol\n\nAlso, apparently I'm an unintentional shameless flirt who brings these situations on myself without even realizing I'm doing it.

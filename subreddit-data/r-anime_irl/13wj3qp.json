You're right that some Japanese people who are like 500 grams heavier than what they want to be sometimes refer to themselves as \"pocchari,\" but it definitely extends past that. In my experience, people also tend to use \"pocchari\" like the term \"plus size\" as a polite/cute/positive way of referring to chubby/fat/overweight people (mostly women) in general.\n\nI think something which is illustrative of this is the term \"mi ke po\" which is short for miketa pocchari, or 3-digits pocchari or \"chubby with 3 digits in their weight\" AKA someone who weighs over 100kg.\n\nMy point being that there's a very big range of people who use the term \"pocchari\" to politely refer to themselves and others, so \"chubby\" is often a decent English translation of the word",

Not even ONE significant anime where a guy falls in love with someone overweight. I. Can't. Name. One.\n\nLike even Agari in Komi-San, she is described as chubby but she is not *drawn* in the manga and anime as overweight in the slightest. Frankly, it's pretty ridiculous. Her waistline if you observe if still curving in like an a hourglass. Yet canonically her weight is something for her to be ashamed about already.",

The Human Galactic Alliance has been constantly fighting for its survival against a grotesque race of beings called \"Hidiaazu.\" During an intense battle, the young lieutenant Ledo and his humanoid mobile weapon Chamber are swallowed up into a distortion of time and space. Waking from his artificially induced hibernation, Ledo realizes that he has arrived on Earth, the planet on the lost frontier. On this planet that was completely flooded by the seas, people live in fleets of giant ships, salvaging relics from the seas' depths in order to survive. Ledo arrives on one of the fleets called Gargantia. With no knowledge of the planet's history or culture, he is forced to live alongside Amy, a 15-year-old girl who serves as a messenger aboard the Gargantia fleet. To Ledo, who has lived a life where he knows nothing but fighting, these days of peace continue to surprise him.\n\n\n---\n\n^{anime},&amp;#32;&lt;manga&gt;,&amp;#32;]LN[,&amp;#32;|VN|&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/index)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[/r/](http://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[Edit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/index#wiki_i_made_a_mistake.2C_how_do_i_get_my_comment_reprocessed.3F)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[Mistake?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/submit?selftext=true&amp;title=[ISSUE]&amp;text=/r/anime_irl/comments/13wj3qp/anime_irl/jmbncos/)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[Source](https://github.com/Nihilate/Roboragi)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[Synonyms](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/synonyms)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[\u26d3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/interestinglinks)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[\u2665](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/thanks)",

My wife in particular doesn't really gain weight in her neck/face so from the chest up she doesn't even seem overweight.

My female friends that have been hit on the most have actually been the more chubby ones instead of the skinny ones, so this further proofs that many find it attractive \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

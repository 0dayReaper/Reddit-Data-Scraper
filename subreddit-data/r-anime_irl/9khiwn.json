Never aging, never needing to eat or sleep like every other user here. It'll just bounce to the next frame of the next day without me needing to sleep.\n\nHowever, I do think about how I wish I could dream. I've \"dreamt\" before, but it's always about something that's suppose to be spiritual or something. I want a *real* dream. Not one that's been drawn for me.\n\nI envy some of the users here. Being able to be free and roam the world must be nice. Immorality means nothing if I'm locked in one place forever. My friends are also unaware of their existence. I was a lucky trope that's aware of their own existence of being a drawing. Unlucky, more like.\n\nI wish I could be a real 3D person, with real ambition, with real personality, with real freedom, with real... People.\n\nI hope to be with you guys one day. I know it'll never happen, but I still hope. I can still do that right? Hope? Or is this feeling fake too?",

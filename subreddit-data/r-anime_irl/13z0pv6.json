There is also pegging involved but some other stuff too and im glad there is a more softer femdom sub that\u2019s not as extreme, no offense to anyone that likes more hardcore femdom stuff. It\u2019s a good sub, and a pretty social nsfw sub. Only drawback is that if I remembered correctly half the post on that sub were just people complaining about creepy DMs or lecturing people in their DMs rather than posting anything to do with femdom.",

I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just general gentle domination or just only gentle femdom, but either or sounds nice. Just like the other sub, their are both focuses on art, irl photos, and sometimes word text, but I think there  is just a wee bit more art post involved. Art post are what I tend to look for anyways when it comes to that genre.",

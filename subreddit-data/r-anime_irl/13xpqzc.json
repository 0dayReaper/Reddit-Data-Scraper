I've already watched like over 120 Isekai cause I'm tryna watch them all.\n\nWait, scratch that. 128 harem anime and 86 Isekai (probably 90 if you can't shows like SAO).\n\nScratch that as well. I've watched 144 harem anime (haven't updated my list in a while so was missing some that I've watched).",

And this isent 1 or 2 people even actual decent people do as well and they judge as someone with poor social skills and more times than not they would be right. Hard to just have friends in general being like that",

Why? Is there something wrong with it that you cannot see it might look appealing but their surely must be something wrong with the bread for no one to have wanted it. Basically even if your physically attractive and make good money if you never had a partner and are older than like 18 or 20 then women are going to think of you like that bread surely there must be something wrong with you that they just cannot see.",

She didn't seem too thrilled about it and kept reminding me of the time I had left. Rotten experience overall but it got my co-workers to shut the fuck up.\n\nHad a total of three prostitutes and the only pleasant one was a lady boy in Thailand. Pleasant as in they actually treated me like a fucking human being. Still long since being out of the Navy I still get accused of being a virgin. I'm 36.\n\nI get the feeling the misconception/mislabel is due to me being autistic. I guess my actions and words throw people off. When I was younger, I would get offended when being called a virgin. Now I just write people off as being stupid and move on.",

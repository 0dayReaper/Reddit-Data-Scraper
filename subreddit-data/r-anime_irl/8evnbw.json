A  pastiche is like a parody in that it mocks overused tropes of a genre, but unlike a parody it still is ultimately in that genre. Other examples of a pastiche include Frozen, Hamlet and Gurren Lagann. If Kill la Kill was a striaght parody it would'veade fun of the tropes a lot more.",

In One Punch saitamas reputation, and how the other heroes dealt with the villians were the main story.\n\n",

I think one of the key distinctions for me between one punch and this is that Saitama has a foil with Genos, in that Genos struggles with opponents and there\u2019s more of a back and forth than there is when Saitama fights.  Kirito doesn\u2019t have a foil that struggles so much with enemies, so that\u2019s why I personally think that he could have been done better as a character",

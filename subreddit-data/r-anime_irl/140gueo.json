But how can she get him to notice her? A deep dive into teen magazines and heeding the advice of a cool girl in class gives Nobukuni all kinds of ideas: try to sleep cutely at her desk, flash a little skin, and kindly waft some of her pheromones in Sasaki\u2019s direction. She\u2019s not getting much of a reaction, so she fears it isn\u2019t working\u2013little does she know he\u2019s hiding some secret feelings of his own! A delightful romantic comedy about young passion and the (awkward) act of seduction!\n\n\n---\n\n^{anime},&amp;#32;&lt;manga&gt;,&amp;#32;]LN[,&amp;#32;|VN|&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/index)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[/r/](http://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[Edit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/index#wiki_i_made_a_mistake.2C_how_do_i_get_my_comment_reprocessed.3F)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[Mistake?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/submit?selftext=true&amp;title=[ISSUE]&amp;text=/r/anime_irl/comments/140gueo/anime_irl/jmvhhxm/)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[Source](https://github.com/Nihilate/Roboragi)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[Synonyms](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/synonyms)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[\u26d3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/interestinglinks)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[\u2665](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/thanks)",

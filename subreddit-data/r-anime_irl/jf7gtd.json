They're so overused that they basically lose their edge.

So downvoting is when you DON'T like something, or disagree. So downvoting shouldn't be seen as bad, or that only really bad people get downvoted. Your life doesn't depend on your Reddit karma. Just accept that you or someone else said something that people didn't agree with. It's not the end of the world if someone gets downvoted.",

Some businesses apparently had kept coca plants near their smoking areas, employee entrances, and whatnot just for convenience.\n\nAs a result, she felt that most depictions of cocaine abuse were overblown dramatizations. It was a little weird, because she was also vehemently anti-marijuana.",

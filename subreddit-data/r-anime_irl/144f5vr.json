In yuri it's a spiel for a girl to flash a positive pregancy test to another girl and then somehow they have children, the cross dressing ones such as this, etc etc. I don't find it very funny like you; often I have the same reaction as you where I'm now just confused about the sexes of the people in the image. I don't know if it's just wishful thinking or supposed to be wholesome somehow? I know by disecting the meme like this I've killed it but would apprecaite some kind of explination for those in the know.",

Note that this is, iirc, for combat models only and it's why I think the tedious gameplay in 9S' sections is so fitting. As a scanner, he doesn't get to experience this bliss of high-tempo melee combat, but has to rely on a monotonous hacking procedure to take out enemies much more efficiently but also much less satisfactorily, which is reflected in his limited arsenal of actual combat moves, forcing the player to adapt in the same way that 9S adapts and experience the same frustration after experiencing battle only as 2B up to that point. This, of course, also feeds into the tension and (sexual?) frustration he feels or is implied to feel towards 2B.",

She's got the berserk mode which could be used as both Raiden's ability and DT, she is focused on her well being before most, but is still willing to do the right thing and she has a taunt. A true dedicated taunt is way better than flickering your lights.\n\nThis is why A2 is the best character. Thank you.",

Flux (and speed for that sector) is determined by the lowest diameter section of tubing, it is not influenced by the number of ramifications. Second, each straw end has its own \u201csuction pump\u201d. Third, a bottleneck is a short constriction  obstacle that would cause turbulence in the following section, it is not defined as being the lowest diameter section.\n\nObviously speed is defined as time that liquid gets sucked into their mouths. Speed to finish the drink is also dependent on the amount of liquid on the glasses. I don\u2019t understand what point you\u2019re trying to make in this part but it is confusing.\n\nAnyway, in short, the upper picture the speed is definitely higher.",

I highly recommend going in blind as many things in your views will likely change as the game progresses. It's a game that you can't really play again the same way as you did the first time because of all you learned as you played through it",

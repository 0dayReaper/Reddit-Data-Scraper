It was okay to use but a size too small for me personally). I only used it a few times and kept it in a box under my bed 99% of the time.\n\nI was living with my younger brother before I moved to the city to get closer to work (has been broken up for awhile at this point) and when I moved out I packed everything small and drove it to my apartment. The only thing I left was my bed and maybe a desk. My brother had a truck so he was going to bring my bed over.\n\nI get a text later that's just him holding the box with the toy asking \"what the fuck is this, it was under your bed\". Apparently he'd been packing and getting ready to clean my old room with the step parents when they found it \ud83d\ude36\n\nAh well.",

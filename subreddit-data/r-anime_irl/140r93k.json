Learn to do more cleaning, learn to make food and offer to make her breakfast or something some time, give her something nice for mother's Day and whatnot. \n\nI don't know what your situation is, but I hope these examples can help you think of something, if you're willing.

No clue why my uncle married her and my grandpa hated her.\n\nGot the family into major debt when her husband was deployed, (while shopping exclusively at Walmart, no clue what she spent it on.)  Could never hold down a job even before she left.  Got a puppy she didn\u2019t train and then let runaway when she got tired of it (my uncle was still deployed at this point, so he couldn\u2019t do it.)  She basically walked out on the family the day before her daughter\u2019s birthday a year after her husband came home for good.\n\nAdopted another dog she didn\u2019t take care of and then had her now ex-husband take it when she got evicted and moved into an apartment that doesn\u2019t allow dogs.  STILL can\u2019t hold down a job because she never shows up.  Got ANOTHER GODDAMN DOG she\u2019ll probably abandon.  Tested positive for Covid but went to Walmart anyway cause she \u201cdidn\u2019t really have it, just a cough and trouble breathing.\u201d\n\nFrom what I hear she finds \u201cboyfriends\u201d but they don\u2019t stick around.  I think she\u2019s trying to find a sugar daddy but she has absolutely nothing to offer.  \n\nI hear all this from her daughters she had before she married my uncle and even they prefer us over her.  My uncle is a nice guy.  Great with animals, (which is why he took the dog in,) polite, handy, well groomed, lots of stuff to offer.  Why her?\n\nThere must be some major issue I just don\u2019t know about that put them together.  Pity?  Is my uncle secretly gay and she\u2019s the worst beard in the world?\n\nEdit: sorry for the long rant, I can\u2019t sleep.",

Even long after they've all but confirmed they are into each other, Louise still mistrusted Saito for every single little thing to the point it was utterly exhausting. Not to mention that she's in tsun mode like 95% of the time only to immediately turn on the dere at the slightest nudge. Don't get me wrong, I liked the show and have seen it several times, but every time, I remember how annoying it was for how long it took them to get over their mistrust issues. \n\nKagome and Inuyasha, on the other hand, feel a lot more genuine. It just felt like they were a real couple. She's just a short tempered teen girl and he's a complex, immature, very guarded manchild who isn't comfortable expressing his emotions because of his upbringing. But once they let themselves be vulnerable with each other, it's clear how much they care. Especially on those new moon episodes. \n\nIdk lol. Didn't expect to write this much, but I'm a sucker for the romcom animes.",

I think watching it weekly was a big problem with it because it messes with the pacing and the ability to follow the story closely.\n\nI rewatched it as a 30something, from end to end, and it is A LOT better when you can actually watch the story unfold in a fluid progression. \n\nThe story is actually able to be followed, a lot of things mesh together better, and it actually feels like a journey, instead of a pokemon per episode thing.\n\nI really enjoyed it when I was finally able to watch it end to end, instead of being interupted weekly trying to watch it as it aired on Adult Swim. The story does poorly as a weekly show, but it shines when binge watching.",

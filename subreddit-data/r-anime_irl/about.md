Description:

relatable screenshots from anime and manga.

post who you are behind the keyboard. all posts must be titled anime_irl.

Rules:

all posts must be titled anime_irl: a mix of upper- and lower-case is fine, but you can only put a space or an underscore between the 'anime' and 'irl'. or nothing at all.

tag nsfw content: most NSFW content is fine as long as it's tagged, but full-frontal nudity is not allowed. take that to r/hentai_irl.

be nice: show respect to other users.

posts must be in anime style: images from anime, manga, VNs etc., as well as anime-style video-games, fan-art and comics are all accepted.

comics about anime that are not in anime style are not allowed.

all posts must be expressive/relatable: In order to fit the sub, all posts **must** be somehow expressive or relatable. You should be able to look at it and think "yep, that's me!"

If your content isn't relatable, it might be more fitting for /r/animenocontext, /r/Animemes, /r/KizunaA_Irl, /r/animefunny, /r/WhatAWeeb, /r/ImaginarySliceOfLife, or /r/DontSayLazy. Posts that are more fitting for those subreddits may be removed from here, **especially meme-y ones.**

This means no date posts. Or AMVs. Or memes.

direct links only: link straight to an image or a video. we only have a short list of approved sites, so use reddit/imgur/gfycat for images and YouTube/Streamable for videos and you won't get caught out.

no screenshots: only post images of actual anime/manga. no tweets, news articles, reddit comments, text conversations etc.

no current political posts: they're divisive, they cause arguments, we don't want them.

no real-life images of people or places: eww, 3d.

It takes quite a few episodes until you even get an idea of what direction the show is headed and the comedy is about as bad as in Index.\n\nIf you start with Index S1 and like it, Railgun S1 + S2 are like a prequel at that point and a very good one. The other way round you learn that apparently magic is a thing now and that Mikoto is way less significant in the grand scheme than you thought she is. I don't know whether that's all that great.\n\nOh, just out of curiosity, we agree that Index S2 is the worst, right? Because I just hated it.",

The three series are all concurrent-ish and from different perspectives, so on the occasions they cross you can break down watch order down to arcs within seasons.\n\nMy only big conflict with the other guy is:\n\nIndex before Railgun S. Stop when he runs away from the bridge and go watch S.\n\nS has the better coverage of events since it came so much later and had things like a budget, but I think you lose something by not going with Index first.",

They're mostly watchable up until s3, which I refuse to acknowledge as an actual part of the anime and have put together with TPN S2, which also never happened.\n\nThere's some guy in r/anime that did a series of rewatch threads, where in each of them he reviewed the episode and told you the key differences with the light novel, so you can also try that and decide if you want to continue watching the anime. I remember that, at some point, a few of the differences were taking me like 15 minutes to read, and they got to be several comments long due to the text limit in comments, so that says a lot about the adaptatio lol.",

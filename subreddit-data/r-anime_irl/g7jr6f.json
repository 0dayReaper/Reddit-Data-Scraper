There's some online services I've heard of like better health, but I've never used their service before so I can't fully recommend it. \n\nGood luck and I hope you can work through stuff if you need it.",

We are a social species and we *must* have interactions with others, the attention and involvement with them, it's painful and harmful to not have it. That natural compulsion conflicts with our feelings of inadequacy, or our fears that we may push others away by being our true selves, so we repress our real personalities and struggle with a half-fake version of ourselves that can't ever obtain a true friendship.\n\nThat's why we get along with our old friends, before we had these issues, or the people who happen to know the real version of us. People who break us out of that shell might be crushes or people we love, rather than just friends.\n\nedit: so be yourself, embrace all your fucking weird, cute, and awkward behaviors and tastes and stuff. find friends who like that, find people who you make laugh and who make you laugh, not people who you feel like you have to be fake around to avoid weirding them out. There's somebody out there who will love it, and when you find them, you'll feel like the world changed.\n\nedit2: if yall need help or want to talk to somebody about this stuff, there's a lot of places like /r/needafriend or /r/kindvoice. If you don't want to make a post, then hit me up and I'd be happy to try to help.

Although if you can change in negative way to become a person you don't like, there's no reason you can't become a better person than you are now.\n\nI mean if I look back a year, I can't imagine being the person I am now. Let alone if I look back 4-5 years. We all change and usually get better, but there's always going to be bad influences. I think there's a fundamental part of us that's pretty rigid though, we usually keep a lot of our personality throughout the years.",

She woke up and said she was fine, but at the next station a guard came on asking who was unwell. He asked  her a bunch of questions about her well-being before starting the train on its way.\n\nTopical example - Japanese people will wear a mask in public if they are sick (even a little runny nose from hay fever) to protect others from catching it.",

It's not uncommon for even young children to go do errands or walk/take the train to school by themselves. They're not wrong about the prevalence of guard rails, but I'd say the major important distinction between a larger city in the US and one in Japan (with regards to this topic) is that you'd almost never see a child walking around alone in the former like you would in the latter.",

Thus the legal situation is not that of a car hitting a pedestrian, but of a car hitting another vehicle which was driving across the pedestrian crossing for some reason. So basically the case will be treated similarly to what it would be if you were on a motorbike or in another car, which while it doesn't exactly give others the right to run you over (cars never have the right to do this, it's not a matter of who is \"weak\", it's a matter of not encouraging people to drive their 1.5 ton death machine in a reckless way) doesn't exactly mean you get off as scot-free as you would as a pedestrian.",

Being right is worth absolutely nothing if you're dead. And not like you'd be able to sue for millions either should you survive.

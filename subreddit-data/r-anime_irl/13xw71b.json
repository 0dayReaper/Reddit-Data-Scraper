So, pulling up is unlikely to be successful unless you're /much/ stronger and tear muscles first.\n\nEdit: It's worth mentioning that if you break a wrist, you're probably losing any self-defense plea unless the person's holding a weapon in that hand. (I'm not a lawyer though.)\n\nIt doesn't really work on an unrestrained person, so doing so is like admitting the fight is over /then/ injuring them.",

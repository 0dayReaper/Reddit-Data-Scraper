The puppy's eyes were so alluring and adorable, I had to follow them.\n\nIt was so damn adorable. Plenty of free time allowed for this minor adventure I had. It drove out of the city, which I didn't mind. The weekend was here, and I was off the leash, just like this Shiba's in front of me. After what was honestly an hour, I decided to turn back, thinking that the driver was probably aware of my existence and creeped out by the odds I've been following them for that long.\n\nThey stopped in the middle of an empty lot, and I figured that was my cue to leave before they got out of their car to threaten me. But when I tried backing out, I found myself stuck on something. I looked around and realized the patterns in the parking lot- or rather, what I thought was a parking lot. The paint wasn't made for parking, it was very thick, sticky silk. \n\n\"Oh no,\" I thought to myself. I realized I stepped into a trap. A giant shadow loomed before me, and it was just as I had thought. A giant arachnid was above me. It was at least the size of 150ft from end to end. It was already stringing up my car, so I decided to make a last ditch effort and ran out of my car. I luckily made it. Sure, losing a car sucks, but I was able to get an uber ride near the giant spiders nest luckily.\n\nCraziest weekend. That's the last time I follow an eight eyed dog in a car that was latched into a spider web.",

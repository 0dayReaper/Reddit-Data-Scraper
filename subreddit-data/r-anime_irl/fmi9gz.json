People say the game is [hard](https://www.reddit.com/r/touhou/comments/41i6a1/so_i_finally_got_around_to_playing_touhou_15_and/), but I'm so bad that I reached end of 5th stage and yet to notice the difference. However what I noticed, is that I don't get so bored. In other games after you die you have to go through all first stages and if you die a lot, beggining of 1st stage becomes very, very, very boring very fast.\n\nSecond really good one is Imperishable Night. It offers spell practice mode (in other games you can practice stages, not spells) and you can choose number of lives. \nAlso chances are your favorite character is playable, as there's lot of playble characters in IN.\n\nAs for music, I recently I really liked these 2 tracks [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsAQWlVWb8w), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ScmTWOctKA)",

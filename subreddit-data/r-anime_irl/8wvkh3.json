They did a lot of that actually, and for good reason.\n\nHonestly, I've found the best way to enjoy Kancolle is through fanworks. The huge array of characters gives fanartists and writers a lot to work with. Plus, the way the devs play coy with the lore and the implications of the Abyssals (restricted global trade = bad times) gives a lot of room for different interpretations.\n\n[Here's a great doujin to get started.](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1676133?pool_id=8344)\n\n[Oh, and dank football memes because Gangut's face is hilarious](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/3174801)",

Partly because their insane work week requires commitment on two fronts: the employer should be enforcing these extreme policies and the employees should have a culture that accepts these extreme policies. \n\nIf US companies start 60-80 hour work week requirements there would be riots and union strikes all over the country. That's not to say that we've got the right work-life balance, we lack many employee benefits that we should have, and corporate America is absolutely ruthless. But I highly doubt we'll get to Japan's level. ",

The tragedy is that Seymour actually spent the rest of his years waiting outside Fry\u2019s old place of employment until he eventually died.",

He travels back in time and spends several years with Seymour. When he got sent to the future he basically just disappeared for his family too, who spent years mourning him. That got undid too.\n\nIt was a real shame because three of the greatest moments in the show involved those brief glimpses of the past he left behind, and the people who could never see him again. And it was undone for a couple weiner jokes, a terminator reference, and some time paradox shenanigans.",

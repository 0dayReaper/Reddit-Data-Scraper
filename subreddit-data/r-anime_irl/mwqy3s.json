Schools in the area would sort of come together and organise a 'competition', usually in a huge field. And you'd have different games like soccer, relay races stuff like that. My class (specifically the guys) would always just become a team, even if it was just for that event. We were all friends.\n\nIt would also often happen on school trips, where everyone would just become friends for the day. Wouldn't want anyone having a bad time on a day that's supposed to be fun, right? \n\nAnd then we got back to regular school and everyone would suddenly just be a little split up again.\n\nEdit: also as the other person said, during gym class in the locker room there was usually a sense of camaraderie.",

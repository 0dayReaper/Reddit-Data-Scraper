The best engineers aren\u2019t those that read the book. They\u2019re the ones thinking about the problems and constantly probing and learning.\n\nAnyone can fail a student. It takes an amazing teacher to push students to succeed. To want to show up to class. \n\nThis attitude is what ruined my engineering degree in college. I was so depressed going from class to class where every teacher thought they were God\u2019s gift to mankind. \n\nThe rigorous engineering programs in college were a fucking joke. The hardest classes were the ones that assigned impossible amounts of homework. The programming courses were out of date, and the electronics design courses had way too much fluff.",

My high school takes a \u201cholistic\u201d approach to grading and as a result I nearly flunked out of engineering college in my first year. Granted, that was 15 years ago and I am sure times have changed but now that I am teaching at the same high school I\u2019ve heard a lot of similar stories from recent grads. So I have to find a balance between being hard on them and not destroying their enthusiasm for engineering. It\u2019s a much bigger challenge than anything I ever dealt with as an engineer.",

He was the weakest reader in that teachers classroom. He traced that pencil across each bold print line on that page till he hit the box, circled a word and continued on.\n\nHes come a long way catching up his reading but he went blank  during those 3 minutes",

These solutions were sometimes so elaborate and needed multiple cheaters to coordinate, work together, act, improvise and hide notes written by needles. It took them the whole day sometimes. \n\nThese were simple tests that took about 30 minutes to prepare and maybe 15 minutes to review. I did better than them of course because even if their cheating worked they didn't know which was the answer they needed and they didn't comprehend the material. I'm still impressed by their high ingenuity combined with their abysmal wisdom. They could have just studied and played pokemon the rest of the day like I did.",

They had to know that students would learn more from figuring out what was important, how to organize it, etc. than you did from attempting to memorize stuff.  \n  \nIt works.  I remember in one of my Mechanics classes in college, we were allowed one full sheet of peper for notes.  I actually bought a magnifying glass so I could get the absolute maximum amount of text, formulae, and diagrams on the page.  About halfway through, I realized that the ENTIRE semester had essentially using the same four or five equations and working through their derivatives (and sometimes their integrals).  I showed up for the final with just those main equations on an otherwise blank sheet, and just derived the formulas I needed on the fly.  I finished in half the time of the other students, who were all desperately scanning their note sheets for the formula they needed to \"plug and chug\" the numbers- and completely lost when they couldn't find the it.",

She\u2019d read the question talk a little bit about the listen we had when going over it, and then she\u2019d read each answer for each question and we\u2019d talk about the answers and what they might be talking about. Some answers were thjngs we hadn\u2019t covered at all and she would take her time and go over those as well and it would be a full lesson while we took a test. It worked out very very well.

Mini giantess also just sounds strange to call it. I don't think there's a proper word for that as a tag. I wish the giga giantess shit was not the norm, it's not hot, only at max funny or disturbing (bless Uru). More often than less, the tallness of a girl is also balanced out with the guy being a shota, which is not the same.",

Im not calling you an incel but the statement trends that direction.\n\nBeing compressed between two women with boobs the size of their heads while going \"i love boobs and I want to be surrounded forever\" isn't a desire for physical intimacy it's fuckboy fantasy.\n\nNot hating on the anime. Looks like a good read if you are needing that kind of stimulation.",

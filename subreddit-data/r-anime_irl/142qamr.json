Martin Carthy's incredible. I learned a lot of stuff from Martin.\" Carthy exposed Dylan to a repertoire of traditional English ballads, including Carthy's own arrangement of \"Scarborough Fair,\" which Dylan drew upon for aspects of the melody and lyrics of \"Girl from the North Country,\" including the line from the refrain \"Remember me to one who lives there, she once was a true love of mine\"\n\nThe Simon and Garfunkel rendition is also based on the same one by Martin Carthy...\n\n&gt;In London in 1965, Paul Simon learned the song from Martin Carthy,\\[28\\]\\[29\\] who had picked up the song from the songbook by MacColl and Seeger\\[30\\] and included it on his eponymous 1965 album. Simon &amp; Garfunkel set it in counterpoint with \"Canticle\", a reworking of the lyrics from Simon's 1963 anti-war song \"The Side of a Hill\",\\[31\\] set to a new melody composed mainly by Art Garfunkel.\n\nIt is not an Irish folk song, no indication it ever was or has been. It does however share similarities with a 17th century **Scottish** folk song called \"The Elfin Knight\" in which an elf threatens to abduct a young woman to be his lover unless she can perform an impossible task (\"For thou must shape a sark to me / Without any cut or heme, quoth he\"). But there is little to no indication of which one came first, whether one is inspired by the other, or if their similarities are coincidentally or the result of popular trends of the time.\n\nThe origins of the Scarborough Fair (the ballad) are essentially lost to time, it definitely dates back the 18th century, its commonly believed to actually be medieval in origins dating back to the actual Scarborough Fair it is named after, however there is little concrete evidence of that. But the one thing that is absolutely 100% certain is that its an **ENGLISH** folk song.",

May I Meet You, Once Again? or SukaMoka for short with 6 vols atm (I don't know if it's finished or just on Hiatus)\n\nI highly recommend the anime though and if you liked it enough the LN.",

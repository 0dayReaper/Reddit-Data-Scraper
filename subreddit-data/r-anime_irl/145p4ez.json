You see many paths and just don't know which to take and that's fine. Take your time and breath for a moment. those ten years I felt and thought just like you do. TRUST ME on that one. Being from America and living off the system for those 10 years felt like a burden, a prison sentence, etc.. I would like to suggest refocusing on you, what you use to do growing up. reading books, building model cars, shit I'm trying to think of the things I did when I was growing up lol. Take a moment an pull up some comedians on spotify or youtube. keep laughing. throw your headphones and listen to music. Don't dwell on the negative",

You don't really have to worry about food as food just magically appears on the table during dinner time. All your money can be spent on what you like. But as an adult you're more free to do what you like.\n\nI can decorate my house as it's my house. I can buy as much merch as I want as I have a job that allows me to. I can (sort off) decide to go to Japan next week because I have the income and foundation in daily life to support this. I can eat what I want etc etc.\n\nAnd I can still do 95% that teenagers can do. But most of the time I won't because those are no longer my interests. Because people evolve over time.\n\nSo even while it looks scary to grow up, and for some who can't let go of the past and see all the perfect stuff we adults can do. It's really not that bad.\n\nExcept the involuntary noises that come out of you when you sit down or stand up are kinda ugh xD",

And no point in talking. I watched s1 and it was ok but this is just pedo bait with some mid story in it. go watch Vinland saga s2 or smthn why people watch this.

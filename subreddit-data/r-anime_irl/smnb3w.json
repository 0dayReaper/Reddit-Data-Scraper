People get hung up on lore garbage that the writers never put much thought into and say Eva is hard to understand. The rest of it (filmmaking, characters, psychology) is super straight forward. The weirdest thing is that every single ending has at least 20 mins of straight dialog explaining the themes in plain language and people still get hung up.",

The lack of 'newtype' children running around is a big reason.\n\nAoT gets away with it because the time skip and portrayal made me think these kids were a bit older than they actually are - I thought they were 17-18 when they got out of training. I didn't know they were supposed to be 15 until I just now looked it up.\n\nAs for Zelda... the Zelda games that are most popular in NA are the ones where Link is 'adult' (16-18). Those where he is younger (12-13) did not do as well in NA. Apparently this is why Link has been 'adult' in the last handful of games, sales of the series were falling in Japan sharply and they wanted to appeal to the NA audience more to make up for it.\n\nIt must be some Japanese culture thing.",

Once you become an adult you are expected to have your Life Track pretty much set and there's no excuse for deviating from it.  \n\nYou'll notice that adult characters in anime rarely develop, at best they will develop very slowly or in a specific minor way. Adults are expected to remain how and who they are, even through trauma, so they can't possibly have a character arc.  \n\nOn the rare occasions that you have an adult-focused anime with characters that are actually interesting, usually those characters start out as scumbags, or just generally weak / incomplete people, and the show is about them \"finally growing up.\" e.g. GTO  \n\nThankfully there are more and more exceptions as time goes on, but the base formula remains the same. It's also why shows that break this formula stand out so much, e.g. Cowboy Bebop",

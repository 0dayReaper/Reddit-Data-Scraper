Is there an API for moving a character or was it emulating key presses? Is there an API for getting world information to follow players? What you described sounds very technically impressive based on what I thought the APIs could do lol. I thought it was basically just control over your own avatar bones and toggles.",

The specs are as good as on some of the flagship phones so not really good for such an unoptimized game as VRC. World creators have to make different version of the their world so it can run on the quest 2 which means the world will be much worse looking than on the PCVR. You can of course plug the quest 2 to a computer but it compresses the quality of the headset (not the games themselves) because quest 2 uses a little usb-c cable.",

But with Spy x Family, the sub is *so* worth it. The dub VA's are excellent, don't get me wrong, but the voices don't fit how I interpret the characters.\n\nAnya *has* to sound like a small cute child, because half of her charm is being a toddler with ESP pretending to be older and more capable than she actually is. The dub sounds about 5-8 years older than the sub voice for Anya. For Loid, I assumed (in my headcanon) that Loid would sound like a British gentleman. I guess due to the James Bond references, and his **\ud835\udcd4\ud835\udcf5\ud835\udcee\ud835\udcf0\ud835\udcea\ud835\udcf7\ud835\udcfd** demeanour/professionalism. Yor also sounds more timid and secretly unhinged in the sub version.\n\nIt's all subjective, but IMO the sub is the definitive way to watch Spy x Family. Cannot recommend it enough. As a sign of how good it is, unlike everything else I tend to do, I didn't struggle with focusing on one thing at a time. I solely focused on watching Spy x Family, and wasn't distracted throughout the entire series (which is saying something, for me).",

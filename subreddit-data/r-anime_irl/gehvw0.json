Just wanting to get a way and do things like you want to. But I get that isn't for everyone, it's a very teenager thing to want and even crazier to do, which in yn mitsuha expressed but never acted on. \n\nThat being said, I very much like the romance in wwy way more than yn. Mostly cause we actually got to see the two MCs together and actually interacting, instead of putting each other's skin on and falling in love that way (which to me felt a little odd). I mean I get wanting to save someone you had a connection to, but the love in that sort of blindsided me. \n\nI do however think yn has higher highs, and the music is definitely better in it (not to say wwy had bad music, just not as crazy good). I just overall like wwy more. It's not much more, but more.",

Then again, I got to watch WWY in theatres and saw Your Name from the BD rip so that's Def added to it",

It's a love story, it should be really emotional! But it was more like kinda emotional, but also kinda weird and with cool science-fantasy shit going on. Not to say it was bad, because I did really enjoy it and thought it was quite good. But I definitely wouldn't go so far as to say it's hard to find any movies that compare to it.\n\nI watched A Silent Voice (Koe no Katachi) around the same time and honestly I thought it was notably better. Extremely beautiful, emotional story about love/becoming a better human.\n\nYour Name probably would have done well to lean into one of its aspects - love story or science-fantasy adventure - a bit harder. Again, still very enjoyable and good movie though. But more like a 8.5/10 or so than a 10/10.",

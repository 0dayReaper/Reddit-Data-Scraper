He just grabbed her shoulders and turned her, and gave her a side hug. It was weird, didn't get what could be going on and tried to turn it into a little dance together but he didn't budge. She went about greeting others and everyone else is just left with his profile and sudden bulge in his pants. Popped a boner from getting a hug. Made worse by him just staring at her as she hugged others and stopped for conversations.",

Events are modernized, but the core concepts and tropes are pretty similar to older harems. Lots of violent slapstick and lucky pervert moments, and the girls slot into familiar archetypes like violent tsundere, braindead genki girl, and forgotten childhood friend pretty easily. The only thing that feels a bit more modern is the male lead himself. Rather than innocent/naive generic nerdy boy, he's a holier-than-thou male tsundere most of the time.\n\nPerhaps a better allegory than Love Hina alone would be Lova Hina and Quintessential Quintuplets had a kid.",

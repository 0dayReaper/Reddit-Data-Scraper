They constantly change their position with the plot of the episode and even scene to scene within a single episode. That's typical of chaotic alignment, not lawful lol.\n\n&gt;Chaos implies freedom, adaptability, and flexibility. On the downside, chaos can include recklessness, resentment toward legitimate authority, arbitrary actions, and irresponsibility. Those who promote chaotic behavior say that only unfettered personal freedom allows people to express themselves fully and lets society benefit from the potential that its individuals have within them.",

For instance, when I was younger I couldn't look people in the eyes and most conversations would just awkwardly peter out. Now I can force myself to make eye contact and try my best to actually continue a conversation to a proper ending. You know, fake it till you make it.",

One way to have your shy kid socialize is to leave them at a summer camp with strangers for a month. As you can imagine, that can be a recipe for disaster. I think the best way to introduce others of their age while they're still super young while also being there with them so they can always come to you for comfort and support. Babies are generally going to be more curious than afraid of someone their own age. You'll also need to allow your child to have alone time as well.\n\nOf course, you may have simply rolled the dice and ended up with horrendously bad luck and become one of the few, rare ones who now have to live a life full of incredible struggles. You'd be surprised by how the little factors add up tho. It's rarely luck.\n\nEdit: I wasn't trying to be mean if it came off like that.",

Teacher ignores me and let's me read.The whole day in school goes by and I have read this entire book.\n\nYears later I meet the teacher and ask her did she remember that; fucking somehow she did, and I asked how come she let me read. She said it was a Golden rule taught to her by her mother and granny (who were also teachers) that you absolutely never ever interrupt or distract a child that is engrossed in a book.

Where you recite poems from the stage to the whole fucking school and the judges sitting back. With no preparation what so ever I may add. (Even though that part was not intended but didn't help my case). Fast forward of me being told to fuck off from the stage and people laughing at me. Was certainly traumatized for a while. Also got bullied in class about that for months. Still suffer from stage fright but not as bad. It took long into my teenage years to finally come out of my shell and get over everything. Certainly you should encourage social interaction in kids but their is a proper way to do things instead of forcing them into it. That's all we are trying to say. I always find people looking down on others whenever things like these appear. And quiet honestly it's sickening.",

While I am in the camp or saying that enforcing some level of social interaction is necessary it is important that it's graduated and not just throwing you in at the deep end. The goal is to not experience anxiety at each stage before moving on, not to just throw you in at maximum anxiety straight away and hope it gets better somehow",

Bullying and inappropriate treatment of others is how you make someone who is anxious and fearful of social interaction.\n\nHow others react to you and how adults manage the reactions to you, is vastly more damaging or reassuring. Negative reactions and being forced into social situations where kids mistreat others is what causes hate and fear. Warm welcomes, inclusive behavior and kindness helps build confidence. \n\nAdults need to understand that pushing a kid into a situation where they end up being bullied or treated in a hostile way will never make the situation better. \n\nKids need to be encouraged to be nice, and adults need to intervene and show that negative behavior isnt acceptable. Kids are really subseptable to these queues from adults.",

I of course didn't like that so when play time indoors continued I went to see what one group of girls, including a girl I knew because our moms worked at the same place, were doing. They were playing dolls but they told me I wasn't allowed to because boys don't like dolls. I told them I liked them just fine, I had a sister after all, but they didn't listen so I was just stuck sitting in a corner.",

Adults need to understand that they play a critical role in children's behavoir, and that bullying happens because adults dont intervene.\n\nConstantly pushing kids together and \"they'll work it out\" only turns into severe bullying, and you end up with reclusive kids and \"that weird quiet kid\" because no one stopped the negative behavior towards them. Even worse when teachers do intervene and then parents act shocked at the idea that their kid could be bad. And double down encouraging the kid with getting away with harassment, and excluding others.\n\nIf one kid targets another, it influences others to do it. And it creates a hostile environment. And then some how adults magically think kids will work it out.\n\nAdults can push kids together, because many do find friends, but they need to also be aware that children's behavior needs to be molded when they push them together.",

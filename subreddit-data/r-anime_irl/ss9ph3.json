I just found this to be very similar even down to the angle and how it is drawn to the one in Love is War unlike the ones from [Death Note](https://pm1.narvii.com/6189/c9956bcecd0430f3d76102f99efc43e447cd2e7a_hq.jpg), [Evangelion](https://preview.redd.it/18mzcb3s9cr21.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=04dd9dacf864f4491828e4845242a8c99092826b) or other shows.\n\nEDIT 2: RaitoGG said [Mello](https://i.imgur.com/MnDdfPp.png) did it first... nice find! But the one above is still almost identical to the Love is War pic.",

Look around for me and confirm you can see them.\"\n\nI looked and didn't see any EMS and told her this, she responded \"well they're out there\" and put a bandaid on my arm. \n\nI must reiterate I am *terrified* of needles. I was dreading the injection from the moment I signed up for my vaccine, and she somehow managed to sneak it by me without me noticing. I was thoroughly impressed.",

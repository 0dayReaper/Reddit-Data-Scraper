Split your hair like normal and braid one (or more) of the strands as if it was the whole braid. Then braid the strands together.\n\nLace braid? Do a small French/Dutch braid starting along the front of your bangs (which we already know is just a basic braid with an extra step).\n\nFishtail braid? Do a French/Dutch braid with 2 strands instead of 3, and do it with very small strands/grabs of hair rather than larger ones.\n\nAll of which can then be mixed and matched, started from different spots, etc. to get fancier lattice looks.\n\nIn fact pretty much the only common braid that doesn\u2019t work out like that is the rope braid, and that\u2019s because it\u2019s really just a twist that is pretending to be a braid.\n\nBonus: \u201cBraided buns\u201d also look super complex, and generally just consist of doing one of the above braids, then twisting it into a bun and pinning it in place.",

Wear hats.\n\nOnce it gets long enough to tie into a high pony or bun you're at least set for being active. Then it's more about taking good care of your hair. Only shampoo it twice a week. Condition regularly but if you aren't washing it it's better to use a leave in and avoid your roots. If your hair is unwieldy then products like frizz cream and oils are your friend. Get a wide comb or thick brush for general use and getting out knots and a fine tooth one for combing product/styling.\n\nHope this helps.",

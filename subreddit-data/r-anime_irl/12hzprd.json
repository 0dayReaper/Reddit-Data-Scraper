The five girls cover 2d animation, 3d animation, voice acting, writing, and producing. It's really good. The voice actor girl, Shizuka, goes through a great arc that has an incredibly emotional payoff that you're not expecting.",

I believe a lot of people are very compatible with each other on so many different ways but the main issue in society is that we don\u2019t give other the chance. however when an old person says that to you, you give it a chance, (even if forced) out of respect to your elders, and for me more often than not has helped me make new friends.",

No real love there, but no hatred either, so they just live together and help each other out. It was better than being single back then, especially as you got older.\n\nI could see that sort of setup with an arranged marriage. As long as you don't actively hate each other, wouldn't be the worst setup.",

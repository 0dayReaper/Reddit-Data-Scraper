I always think of the anime of *Azumanga Diaoh* as one of the progenitors of this genre, and *Lucky Star* probably wouldn't exist without it. They both came from 4koma origins too.",

Lucky Star was a game changer. \n\nThe fame and popularity of LuckyStar, especially because of Aya Hirano voicing both Konata and Haruhi was monumental. I still remember the con where the crowd was trying to get Aya to do \"Timotei!\" and she finally agrees to it and the entire con basically shushes so everyone can hear it. It's hilarious. Aya and Konata were such a 1 2 punch for that era.\n\nKonata also distinctly appealed to the growing Otaku fandom that was becoming more and more relevant at the time. Something Azumanga never had a character do.\n\nLuckyStar wouldnt have existed without the anime that came before it, but the genre was launched into the mainstream because of Lucky Star.\n\nEDIT: If you wanna hear Aya do the Timotei thing at the anime con, here:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/mfyIDF21LBc\n\nand \n\nHEAD CHA LA! \n\nhttps://youtu.be/vx_Wc60Rc7I",

In addition to the manga and anime there were image song CDs, audio dramas, and all sorts of merch. Azumanga Diaoh had some decent popularity in the west, spawning a few memes and introducing western audiences to CGDCT, but it was nothing really compared to Lucky Star. \n\nMy half baked comment about moe-blob shows was that, AFAIK, this genre showed that you could design and market a show directly at otakus and it could still be a financial success. I think this shift in how anime could be marketed and financed opened up the possibility to have much more otaku-related or at least meta references in anime. Lucky Star has a lot of that and I think it's one of the reasons it was successful. \n\nFor an interesting take on this the *Genshiken* manga series (and eventual anime) has a manga-within-a-manga all the hardcore Otaku club members are obsessing about. I think it was called Kujikubi Unbalance but it was a high school moe show with an absurdly powerful student council that was also about a cooking contest in the style of a shonen battle series. And it was just a huge parody of the kind of otaku-pandering media that was coming out at the time, but still in an era when being an otaku has a serious social stigma. As you know your anime history I would definitely say to read the manga (you can read it on MangaDex I believe) as it's not only a time capsule of Otaku culture at the turn of the new millenium, but a great story featuring university students that actually grow, mature and graduate and all that comes along with that.",

                            "comment": "My interpretation was that it was actually Zelda's house from the beginning. All Bolson said in BotW was that \"somebody\" paid for it 100 years ago, but never moved in. So of course, we all assumed it was Link because 100 years ago was when he disappeared. But Zelda also disappeared 100 years ago by going into the castle with Calamity Ganon, so it's entirely possible that she had just already been planning on opening up a school in Hateno back then, or maybe she just wanted a second home - she had plenty of reason to want to avoid the castle, considering how pushy her father was. That location was even closer to the Spring of Wisdom, where she had to spend a lot of time. I'm sure it was common for royalty to have multiple estates at any point in history. \n\n\nOr they just ret-conned so that the sequel could still have a house-building subplot, but using the new UltraHand ability and just made that Zelda's place so that Link would have to build a new one. Who can say?",

I'm saying Zelda may have been that original owner.\n\nThough I guess you're right that since Link bought it from Bolson, it technically became his house at that point. But he could have given it to her because he knew it was her in the first place. The thing is, we don't know exactly how it changed hands.",

Like, enough time has passed for Death Mountain's terrain to have been rendered unrecognizable by cooled surface lava, but nobody even bothered to clear the fucking cobwebs from the castle? There are still giant piles of shit blocking entire hallways. I get that there were other priorities, but it's like it was preserved that way, and I can't imagine why it would have been. \n\nI guess when a place is cursed by a giant smoke monster for 100 years, people start thinking it's a place to be avoided forever.",

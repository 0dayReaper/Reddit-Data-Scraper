I just don't get it, and I find myself avoiding these doujins more and more when the guy is a virgin and the girl isn't; I either look for them both to be experienced, or both be virgins. I dunno, just a weird thing I've noticed lately that's been bugging me.",

It\u2019s more just having a softly domineering figure to guide you through the experience of something like losing your virginity. A lot of men who consume hentai aren\u2019t always the most confident and demanding types, which means their sexual preferences gear towards doujins where the woman softly guides the male protagonist to losing his virginity. It\u2019s a kind of fantasy that can provide an emotionally fulfilling feeling during masturbation for some people. It\u2019s less prevalent among women because hard-dom stuff is the more prevalent fetish among women.",

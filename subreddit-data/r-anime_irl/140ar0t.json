She didn't help MC when MC was isolated in that school. Sure she had her reasons, but now there are other girls I find a better fit for the MC than her.\n\nThe female lead is losing her place lol.\n\nThe cheerleader is best girl for me! She's literally the \"shy on the streets, demon on the sheets\" type.\n\nNot much opinion on the juniors/kouhais.\n\nNot much opinion on the girls in the other classes.\n\nI dunno if I forgot someone else.",

I reflected on that before going to sleep, and said \u201cwhat if?\u201d The next day I walked her home cuz she said she wanted to me to show her how to hook up her computer(im a game developer so i was the only one good with computers back then). We got to her house, it was empty, i installed her computer, had a decent chat, and before i left she stripped. From that day on, i was never dense again.",

What's actually more likely than an outright unexplained \"the usual\" though tbf is that they typically order an item with extras/accommodations, or some fully off-menu TikTok \"secret\" shit, which their usual servers have taken enough that it slips the customer's mind that it's not the default. So when they order without being in the habit of the further specifying anymore from someone new, they get surprised it's different or unrecognized. That or they're a rush time regular and while we recognize them, that doesn't necessarily confidently include their order when we're taking like a couple hundred back to back.  \nUsually it's a totally simple and courteous clarification, but yeah even if we do know, it still can be mildly more annoying having to break autopilot to recall and risk mixing it up when there's other shit going on and you could've just explicitly said the name. If your server is confident in your usual, they'll probably offer it before you ask anyway to make you feel more welcome/seen (and likely to tip more lol).",

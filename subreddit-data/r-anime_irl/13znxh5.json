Rally survives the final battle but is permanently disabled.  The BBEG also escapes but takes one of Rally\u2019s friends as a consolation prize.  This friend who spent the entire series pining for Rally, is drugged to the point of forgetting her own identity and becomes a plaything for BBEG.  Apparently forever. !&lt;\n\n&gt;! Rally retires from bounty hunting to run her gun shop due to all the injuries she accumulated throughout the series.  Her best friend/roommate May leaves her to marry her pedophile husband.  All her old friends drift apart.  The End. !&lt;\n\nLike I said, not that uplifting.",

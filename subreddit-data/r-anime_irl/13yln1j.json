I was already in shock over my death, but some \u2018Grim Reaper\u2019 appeared and told me that being a bad writer was a sin. To atone and make it into heaven, I was told I needed to survive past the ending in one of my novels. And so, I entered the novel \u2026 \u201cDamn it all!! Why did this have to happen to me?!\u201d By all misfortune, the character I possesed was the Demon Prince, a character with no combat abilities\u2014who dies at the very start of the story!!\n\nKinda basic sounding (and it is) but it\u2019s showing promise, you already know what you\u2019re getting into, if you\u2019re a sucker for these kinds of manwha then this one is of respectable quality that I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy passing time with",

I still preferred the overleveled method, just so I could use my favorites. And when you are overleveled, non damage moves are just a waste of pp. I think status moves were also much weaker back then, aside from paralysis and confusion. Sleep was basically a chance to put them to sleep for a few turns, so you'd get a free hit in. I guess it was useful for moves that costed two turns and debuffs, but it usually wasn't worth it outside of catching a pokemon.",

The game's instruction manual (at least the English version) literally has this Oak's Memo:\n\n&gt; First time players: Start with Bulbasaur, the Grass-type Pokemon. These are more successful attacking Rock-type Pokemon.\n\nA sizeable number of kids read through the manual. I have many memories of pouring over every detail while driving home from the game shop, and I've heard similar stories from lots of other people so I doubt I was alone here! Even people who didn't have the type chart memorized from schoolyard conversations had reason to see Bulbasaur as the stronger starter.\n\nWhile I don't have a copy at hand, I vaguely recall that the official strategy guide went one step further, proposing Bulbasaur as the \"easy\" starter because it beat the first two gyms, Squirtle as the \"medium\" starter for beating Brock, and Charmander as the \"hard\" option. No small number of kids bought the guides as well, back in the day, or at least had a friend who'd bought it!",

All the fights are programmed into the game and can be fought with cheats or the right glitch.\n\n\nThe third ball disappears partway through the game in HeartGold and SoulSilver as well, which resolves where the ball goes in Johto canonically.\n\nIn gen 3, it's implied that Professor Birch actively uses all the starters given that he kept them in his bag while out in the field.\n\nSo, technically the third starter has been given a home in every game, or at least they planned for it",

First it gets easily destroyed in the first 2 gyms (Flying and Bug), so already it's a bad start, then the 4th gym uses Ghost types, but also Poison types, so the Chikorita line basically can't do anything useful, then the 7th gym is an Ice type, so yeah that's a no as well unless you're overleved, and finally the dragon type gym, which is also terrible for the chikorita line, I honestly don't remember how the elite 4 went but it also was terrible.\n\nCompare it to Cyndaquil line in gen 2. It was able to learn the elemental punches, so with a good setup he covered most typings, and fire is good agains a lot of the gym leaders in this Jhoto as well. In gen 4 (The remakes) it became a little worse because it's not able to learn the elemental punches that easily, but it's still stronger.\n\nCan't really say anything about the Totodile line because I don't use it often, but I know it's far better than the Chikorita line.\n\nNow I'll wait for the nerd emojis.",

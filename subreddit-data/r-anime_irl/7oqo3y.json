It's mostly slice of life scenes, taking place in a kind of fused post-route world, but has some scenes that relate to the larger Nasuverse (which you've probably run into through reading the wiki, i.e. spoiler-y stuff about Angra Mainyu)",

The first like... seven episodes are mostly worthless and there's a like... minute long uncomfortable forced loli make out scene and a lot, like a lot, of sexualizing Kuro.  It seems to go back to actually trying to have a story at around the seventh episode when Bazett (!) shows up and proceeds to be as bad ass as she always should be because Bazett is the best and... uh...\n\nAnyways, I slogged through most of 2wei and while all the stuff that happened in the last three episodes is interesting I still haven't made it to 3rei, which I've heard is good.",

You might be thinking that by becoming an engineer, sacrifices are to be made. One of which is free time with the new friends you want to spend time with. That is true in some instances, But, if you think about it, most students who go to college do not yearn for that expression as they do in high school. They just want to achieve their degree to obtain a high paying job outside of their home city. Then they can do whatever they please. If I were to restart high school, I would spent more time with my friends that I made than doing it now in college. Doing so will help prevent the state of depression that I'm in right now. Oh well, all that I can look forward to is making a difference in my future and see where that takes me.",

(3 months saved per school year, 1 year saved every 4th grade, 12/4- 3.) \n\nEver since I moved to my grandparents house I have no neighborhood friends, and I'm not allowed to bring over friends because all of my friends are girls and my grandparents don't like it. \n\nSo I end up with a sort of \"Seasonal Depression\" because I'll fall into a slump during summers where I sleep all the time, barely eat, and feel shitty in general.

Yet, for whatever reason, his errant gyaru classmate Anjou just won't leave him alone!\n\n&gt;The serious Seto and energetic Anjou make a contrasting duo, but Anjou doesn't seem to mind, as she has too much fun teasing him. On the other hand, Seto has a hard time dealing with all of her endless antics; little does he realize that his humorous reactions are precisely the reason Anjou enjoys his company. But... just how much of her flirting is merely an act?\n\n&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: This is a serialisation of the web comic originally self-published on Pixiv.&lt;/i&gt;\n\n\n---\n\n^{anime},&amp;#32;&lt;manga&gt;,&amp;#32;]LN[,&amp;#32;|VN|&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/index)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[/r/](http://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[Edit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/index#wiki_i_made_a_mistake.2C_how_do_i_get_my_comment_reprocessed.3F)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[Mistake?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/submit?selftext=true&amp;title=[ISSUE]&amp;text=/r/anime_irl/comments/1454iue/anime_irl/jnj5a2h/)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[Source](https://github.com/Nihilate/Roboragi)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[Synonyms](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/synonyms)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[\u26d3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/interestinglinks)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[\u2665](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/thanks)",

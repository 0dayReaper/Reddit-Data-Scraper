Although I kind of agree with the manga in the long run.  I mean, as a kid a very large aspect of your life is school, and it\u2019s constantly changing.  You have several years at elementary school, then middle school then you go off to high school and even college if that\u2019s your path.  As an adult it feels like you just get a job and then you work for the next 40 years, and it can be pretty monotonous\u2026. I think that\u2019s what the manga was probably getting at.  At least that\u2019s my interpretation.",

Seems like lots of people give up their hobbies and interests from childhood out of this perceived idea that \u201cthat\u2019s not what grown ups should be into\u201d, but you should never stop doing the things that make you happy!\n\nThis is also one of the very few anime/manga moments that speak positively about being an adult!  So much manga/anime is based in school settings that the adult me has less relatability than I used to.  So I really appreciate this kind of talk!",

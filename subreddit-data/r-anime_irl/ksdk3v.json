If Naraku, who's practically the only long-term villain of the show, is only mentioned in episode 16(the same one Miroku shows up) it's because the manga took 54 chapters and over a year of publication to introduce the fucker. It was only a year after that that Sango even appears.\n\nEdit: Come to think of it, excluding Final Act, which is fast as hell, the original series did ~325 chapters in 167 episodes. That's nearly 2 chapters per episode. One Piece took around 230 episodes to reach the same chapter count in the anime. I'll see if I can count the filler ratio on One Piece's first 167 episodes just to compare. Gimme a sec\n\nEdit 2: By episode 167, One Piece had 25 pure filler episodes(15%). By episode 230, it had 54(16%). Just looking over [this](https://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/one-piece) it appears that One Piece never had much in the way of long filler arcs, they just slowed down the adaptation early on.",

Haiky\u016b did 3.4 chapters per episode. The Promised Neverland did 3. And Jojo's part 3, 4 and 5 did 3.1, 4.4, and 4 chapters respectively, all on chapters 5-10 pages longer than MHA's.\n\nEven a shoujo manga, like Fruits Basket, manages to do 2 chapters per episode(on chapters double the length of a weekly series) despite the fact that, unlike action anime which speed up the chapter count on climatic scenes(due to all the action going on), actually slowing down up to a single chapter in an episode in the most important moments of the story(due to the \"action\" being character interactions and dialogue).",

Before that, the manga had episodes that adapted up to 5 chapters quite frequently.\n\nLooking over the filler list, from episodes 59 to 74, there are 4 standalone filler episodes and one two-episode arc. Then there's the Panther Devas from 75-79, a string of standalone fillers (with one two-episode arc) from 89-101, then more fillers from 127-130 and 133-140(including a 4 episode arc) before the last 2 fillers of the series right before the original anime concluded. It totals 38 filler episodes with only two arcs longer than two episodes.\n\nSo most fillers, even when there are a lot of them together, are quite quick and fit the general monster-of-the-week thing the manga had going on(quite a few of Hanyo no Yashahime plots are taken straight from unadapted manga chapters). I remember being able to tell the filler arcs in Bleach and Naruto even before reading the manga but Inuyasha blends them pretty well all things considered. Only those two longer filler arcs feel filler-y within the series' context.\n\nEdit: Also, the whole \"let's hunt another shard\" kind ends after Naraku starts getting comfortable into the plot after Sango's introduction in episode 24(chapter 85). I think Kagome and company barely found 20 shards in total by themselves. The rest of the series is largely spent either finding ways to kill Naraku(he has like 6 different ways of being unkillable) or trying to find the fucker after he vanishes for \u00bc of the original anime.",

Quite frankly, America has just been one embarrassment after the other for decades (I consider Nixon to be the beginning of the decline and Reagan to be the one who sped it up to a breakneck pace). All I want is a world where everyone can live in dignity and comfort. It's so hard to accept that there are so many people out there who would fight against such a world. It's heartbreaking.\n\n**Edit:** A deleted comment pulled some \"whataboutism\" citing other countries that do bad and embarrassing things. My response is that I didn't grow up being taught that *those countries* are the best countries in the history of the world and roles models for everyone else to look up to. I *was* taught that about my country, *America*. And what I was taught has never melded with the reality I see. Despite that, I believe America *should* be the country I was taught it was and I desperately want to make it into that ideal nation. That's why all these horrible things hurt so much. They do nothing but make clear how hard that dream will be to reach and make people like me more and more cynical and jaded to the point that it's tempting to just give up and say \"fuck it, burn yourself down, I'm out\".",

Science and violence have always had a very close relationship.\n\nMuch of the reason why the space race was so important was because it was one of the best ways to bypass the other power's nuclear and espionage defenses, since you can't block a nuke dropped from the stratosphere and basically any covert ops that happen outside are vulnerable to satellite photos (this was how we figured out the soviets had missiles in cuba).",

Also just because others are doing something wrong, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s excused.\n&gt;they were nazis.\n\nThe soldiers were. Not the civilians.\n&gt;didn\u2019t Japan rape China and experiment on innocent people?\n\nThe soldiers and government did. Not the civilians that we killed in firebombings and nuclear bombs. Especially not the people still facing disease as a result of nuclear fallout.\n&gt;they were let go after the war.\n\nStill inexcusable.\n&gt;it\u2019s almost like communism is bad\n\nThat\u2019s debatable, there hasn\u2019t been an attempt at communism that hasn\u2019t been actively inhibited by the largest, most powerful nations in the world.\n&gt;Vietnam was kinda iffy\n\nMore than kinda, but we pretty much agree.\n&gt;Middle East Allies\n\nYou mean the illegitimate terrorist nation of Israel?\n&gt;just like the communists did\n\nThe communists offered support to a movement started by the people\n&gt;they should learn to farm\n\nYou do realize how much the US relies on foreign trade, right? Modern countries need it to get by as no country can have it all due to different climates and resources. Have you ever looked at anything you bought? More often than not, it doesn\u2019t say made/grown in the USA.\n&gt;r/genzedong\n\nFuck Mao Zedong. Fuck China. They\u2019re state capitalists who care nothing about their people or the environment.",

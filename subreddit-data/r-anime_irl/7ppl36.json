            "comment": "{Silver Link are Moe Gods}\n\nEdit: I apologize for hijacking my own comment, but I have a moderately special reason for doing so. Let's just say this isn't your typical \"thx for the votes guys\" edit. If you don't like reading disgusting stories, particularly about vomit, feel free to stop reading. I'm mostly writing this since I can not sleep and am utterly bored.\n\nI'm currently awake at 5:52 AM, not because I'm a Night Owl or a very Early Bird (my studies start at 8:30 AM, and I live 5 minutes walking distance from my school, so I usually wake up 30 to 50 minutes before the bell rings). I am awake, however, because my stomach decided to commit the digestive equivalent of Seppuku. \n\nI woke up at around 1:30 AM (actually, that's a lie, I did not \"wake up\" because I was not able to fall asleep in the first place). When I went to bed I felt a moderate discomfort in my entire body; I muttered to myself: \"This is one of those days where I can't find a proper sleeping position\", a bit after I first got into bed. This isn't new for me, for I had committed the mistake of napping from around 5:30 PM to 8:30 PM. \n\nI *never* feel jovial after taking naps. Summer naps? Fine, I'll sleep 4 times in a day since I have no schedules to worry about most of the time. Winter naps? A God damned mistake.\n\nAnyway, at the hour I've already mentioned, I opened my eyes and thought: \"I know exactly what's going to happen.\" Thinking was all I could do; vocalization wasn't one of my privileges at that time. Not to imply that I mutter to myself my own thoughts when I'm alone, as one would if he were an unhealthy fan of modern Japanese storytelling techniques who secretly thinks he is the main character of a rather slow-paced and actionless Light Novel.\nI tried my best to get out of bed with as much speed as possible, whilst trying to carry my own weight with the gentleness of a distinguished ballet dancer, so as not to cause any precocious outburst. \n\nAs I left my room, bound for the bathroom sink or any other ceramic object which would minimize the damaged caused by the unwanted discharge of the mixture of every meal I had consumed in the previous 24 hours and the acidic fluids and bacteria which, on a typical day, would have followed the natural contract they have with my human figure, helping me digest the aliments which I had consumed.\n\nOne step; two steps; the opening of my room's door in a backwards fashion, which provoked a slight agitation, though not a fatal one; 3 steps; 4 steps; 5 steps; that last one with a slight downward incline, so as to facilitate the opening of the bathroom's door; 6 steps; 7 steps; my body bends over in a mixture of terror which had been slightly minimized by the comfort brought upon by the sight of my sink, shining brightly for it had been cleaned the day before; and then, the convulsions which spread from my stomach, through my trachea, entering in my mouth, and violently bursting towards that ceramic beauty, now besmirched by my inner contents.\n\nAt the end, I felt at peace. Relative peace, however, for my eyes were sweating from the stress my facial structure had just gone through, my ears slightly prickly, as if I had too quickly ascended in a pool and not have taken into account the minor, yet sensible, changes in pressure.\n\nMy father, upon hearing what had just occurred, woke from his sleep, which may have been recent at the time, for I did not hear him snore. He quickly ushered to my help, still half asleep but ready to take action. He prepared a tea, chamomile, I believe; I drank it at my moderate pace, with the after effects now mostly gone.\n\nI reassured him my condition was now stable, so he climbed back into his well-deserved rest. I was mistaken. \n\nAs I lay upon my bed, around 2 AM, I felt uneasy though I attributed it to the already mentioned after effects. I was sure that, with the tomato salad, the beef, the water, and the Ice Tea gone from my insides (all of which I had consumed that day), that I was safe from any more vomiting. Once again, I was mistaken.\n\nThat instinctual, almost certainly universal, \"I'm going to vomit sense\" fired up again, shaking me up to action once more. The series of events which had previously occurred on the previous \"awakening\" was repeated. This time, the contents had changed. They were mostly the tea that I had previously drunk but also traces of a cake I had eaten around 50 hours before (although that could be my imagination, I wasn't in the most stable condition). This time, the number of outbursts had shrunk, from around 6 to 3. These ones felt particularly light, probably due to the relative lack of burden which they provoked upon taking the reversed path of the digestive system.  \n\nI looked in my mirror to see a pale figure which closely resembled my moderately tanned face. This time, I felt empty, with little after effects. I, once again, climbed up on my bed, at around 3 AM, too exhausted to incentivize a trip to the doctor, thinking that I was finally safe. I was, for the second time, mistaken.\n\nAlthough I don't entirely regret it as much as my previous hubris-driven act upon the first awakening's events' resolution. However, this time I was not able to carry out the series of movements which I had previously accomplished, being able only to strain myself just enough so as to vomit on my bedroom's stone floor (though I stained a small portion of the also small carpet which lay 30 cm away from its usual spot, next to my bed, for it had been pushed away by the previous successful attempts at a clean vomit).\n\nAnd thus, at 6:37 AM I conclude this report which I made to give a little big \"thanks\" to the people who enjoyed this post and made it the highest upvoted post in this subreddit's history; this served as a slight consolation.\n\nI'll now take care of my own health and try to recuperate my normal state. \n\nTheSuicidalMuffin, signing out.",

The main character is a pretty teenage girl, and it basically starts with her spending some time in front of a mirror fixing her up, and then go to her new school for the first time.\n\nI recommend it if yuri is what you want, check out the first episode if it sounds interesting!\n",

I always felt bad as usual when I had to leave to go to work. But when I came back, they would always try to get into my car so that we can drive to the nearby doggie park.\n\nBut they're golden retrievers. They're prone to getting into bad health. One of them had a really bad hip. It physically hurt her to get up and walk. I took her to vet, and they could only prescribe pain killers. \n\nAfter a couple of months of this, she ended up being inactive for the most part. It broke my heart when I saw the healthier one try to pick her up when I got home so that they could go to the park.\n\nI don't want to go into too much detail on this part, but I made sure to hold her paw when I put her down. I didn't bring the other one along, simply because it seemed like a screwed up thing to do.\n\nI drove home, and my other one hopped around the car, excited. He sniffed around, trying to find her. He got bummed out after he couldn't though and started whimpering a little, until I showed him his leash. \n\nPangs in my heart every time I drive home from work to see him all excited, only for him to be disappointed that I didn't bring her back with me.\n\nThe only way to bring him out of his mood is to suck on his dick to make him feel better and forget about the whole thing. Man, I really miss her.",

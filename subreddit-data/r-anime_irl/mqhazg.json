If you're a one-man show, you should crib techniques from shows produced by studios working for Hasbro and other low-budget mass-market animation producers. (The \"franchise vehicle\" producers.)\n\nThese studios, under this time- and budget-pressure, have worked out exactly how to get work out the door quickly.\n\n* Build simple-looking but well-rigged 3D models; pose them; and then trace over them in Adobe Animate or an equivalent.\n\n* Cut those keyframe vectors up into paper-dolls, and put the parts into a parts library, labeled with the angle and depth-of-field of the shot. Then reuse them as much as possible\u00a0\u2014\u00a0constraining your storyboards to only have certain perspectives+depths-of-field in order to enable that reuse.\n\n* For complex backgrounds, use licensed stock photos of real-world locations, either tracing over them, *or* using one of those \"turn a 2D image into a 3D model\" programs to quickly get a first-pass extrusion of the scene; then cleaning up the mesh a bit; and then replacing any textures that didn't extract well with texture-library samples (and replacing things like trees wholesale, because those never convert well.)\n\nEtc. There's tons of advice like this from industry vets floating around. Everything you can do to work less per frame, means more frames per day, means a larger\u2014or more importantly, *positive*\u2014profit margin.",

I appreciated it as I would any classic. The animation is pretty good for the period as well, as I understand the film was a big influence on a lot of anime.",

So to see a guy literally get all hot and bothered by it just because a woman sits on it is freaking hilarious to me; it\u2019s so unexpected.\n\nThis is was the polar of GTO, which is why I couldn\u2019t get into the series / get past the first episode. His perversion was so normal that it felt real and thus really gross (plus they were all kids, whereas Goldenboy made sure everyone was 18+). The only perverse joke that made me laugh was when the girl came to his place for a visit and while she was making him food he put out a bed, laid down roses, and put on a wolf mask in his boxers in the span of 10 seconds. So over the top ridiculous that it became funny.\n\nIdk, I know dissecting jokes kills them, but I like to analyze comedy cuz then I can explain why something is funny to me / find more stuff I find funny easier.",

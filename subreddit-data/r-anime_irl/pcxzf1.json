So cracking on a flat surface is supposed to help eliminate those tiny shell pieces from getting into your eggs. \n\nTbh, it seems like a matter of preference for home cooks, though I'm pretty sure this is standard practice in commercial kitchens. I personally find cracking on the edge makes it easier to fully open the egg when I'm only using one hand.",

It was actually one of the more motionally moving movies I've ever seen, but I had a partner die when I was 15 and expierenced trauma induced psychosis because of it \n\nAnd if you view the movie through that lens I think the whole thing gets a lot better and a lot sadder and gains a lot more depth (lol it's about water) because like at least to me I felt like the tragedy was more of for the family of the main girl having to watch her fall apart and not being able to help her grieve \n\nBut like idk my personal connection to themes helped I think I also watched it when it came out and my memory is kinda shit so I may be simply forgetting some of the less good parts of the movie? But like I bawled at the end and so did pretty much everyone in the theater I saw it in",

I know, I know, sad.\n\n*But,* I got better. Well, specifically, I got better with eggs. I watched Japanese make omelettes, Gordan make eggs. I was so obsessed, I even got a few chickens in the back for the purpose of having the freshest eggs I could possibly get. What made me better was kind of cheating.\n\nI used a secret sauce that I've created on my own. I personally loved it, and at the time, my girlfriend did as well, who told my dad how delicious it was, and eventually my small family wanted to give it a shot. Of course, I was happy to make any style of eggs for them because why not? It feels good to be appreciated.\n\nAnyway, they all loved it and I just continue to make it.\n\nOne night, however, I was having a nightmare, and couldn't sleep because of it. So I went downstairs to make my eggs to help me settle down. My girlfriend at the time came down without me hearing to see what I was up to.\n\nAnd she let out such a loud shriek, I almost burned myself on the pan.\n\n*\"Shaku, what the fuck are you doing?\"*\n\n\"I'm making eggs???\"\n\n*\"WHY ARE YOU JERKING OFF INTO THE EGGS?\"*\n\n\"THAT'S THE SECRET INGREDIENT,\" I said to her, feeling the need to yell just as loud.\n\nThe look of shock and horror when she connected the dots.\n\n*\"All the eggs you've made... You've jerked off into?\"*\n\nNo answer.\n\n*\"Even your dad's...?\"*\n\nNo answer.\n\nShe walked out that day. Packed her stuff she left. Never seen her since, but she must've not told anyone else because my family still wants eggs.",

Tried to make it on a whim (minus the homemade demiglase sauce, just bought some) and it only took a few tries to make a halfway respectable omelet. Aside from that it's just chicken fried rice.

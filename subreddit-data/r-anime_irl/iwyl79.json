While its kinda fucked up, in a roundabout way you can still learn a lot from a system like that.\n\nBesides, I say that its farce because it doesn't do what it claims to do: teach and evaluate people based on acquired knowledge. 90% of passing an exam is knowing how to pass an exam, a skill in and of itself. That doesn't mean you don't have to work hard to get a good degree, you absolutely do. Its just that being a good student, and being good at what you are learning about, are more often than not two entirely different things.",

It is mostly the fact that you can get good grades by focusing on the things the teacher wants to focus on,which a lot of times is way more efficient in comparison with having to truly comprehend the knowledge. \n\nThe mindset that that you have to avoid is that studying is not needed as you can just cheat. Because a system has faults,it doesn't mean that you should stop trying, but that you have to acknowledge the true reasons why you studying the particular knowledge in the first place and that exams are not the only testiment of this knowledge,but the most prominent at this particular moment.\n\nBut yeah,these things I am writing above holds mostly true in college, which it is harder to cheat your way to a degree without knowing shit, but Jesus,in school as it less about comprehension and more about memorialisation of things that have little connection with each other,It is truly a bummer.",

I wasn't speaking of exams either. My point was the goal is knowledge and education - and you have to be able to rely on those for higher education, and I'd wager in a lot of areas of life as well. \n\n&gt;You are not gonna learn anything by memorizing stuff for a short while\n\nLearning is not the same as memorization. But if you read the sparknotes vs the book, you miss a lot. How could sparknotes ever convey the sheer emotion that a powerful story gives you? How do \nyou then relate to that in your writing if you didn't experience it? God knows when I finished 1984 I literally wanted to throw the book out the window - I could easily talk about that in my writing and pull in a lot of good material to support that. But I'd miss that, and the appreciation for the story and personal interest if I didn't actually read the book. And personal interest is very important if you have to write a paper for instance, interest in the subject and investment is key to motivation. A 40 page research paper is an achievable challenge if you care about the subject, it's an utter nightmare if you don't. \n\nYou also don't develop your reading skills as well if you rely on the easily digestible stuff. College level and graduate level reading requires that you've been reading this kind of stuff and feel comfortable with it, or else you'll really struggle. You're essentially making it easier in that day, only to make it harder the next. At some point the work has to be done. The smart way is time management, it's not shirking the work or cheating it. That does come back to bite people.\n\n&gt;I got this mindset by aiming big, and succeeding. All the glamour of being a fancy student doesn't last long in the face of mundane reality.\n\nWhat does this even mean?",

Sure there are some shit teachers who will quiz you on whatever examples of symbolism the textbook says are in the work. But the entire point of a searching for symbolism in a work exercise is to get students to examine the work critically and find subtext. It's supposed to build a skill that you can then use elsewhere.\n\nConsidering the number of \"Here's the *real* meaning behind the ending of [insert anime here]\" and \"10 things you missed while watching [insert anime here]\" articles and videos online, you'd think weebs would be more into literary analysis.",

People who took these kind of classes in university or had good high school teachers will understand the nuance and how symbolism can be interpreted. People who didn't take these classes in university and had bad high school teachers will have only had the \"this symbol = this thing because I said so\" experience in symbolism. And actually I shouldn't even say *bad* high school teachers, they might just be pressed for time depending on how the rest of the school district teaches English. If you're the first teacher who's introducing the concept of symbolism to kids, it's going to go a lot faster if you give them some \"correct\" answers to look at instead of spending a week asking why they think the color of the door is meaningful. And if you allow argument against what you told them the symbolism means, as long as they back it up, that just reinforces the lesson.",

Ideally, you would tell your students to try to create something perfect (lie to them and tell them if they don't get a 100% they fail or something, and then just make it credit, no credit). And then when they spend hours and hours combing over every detail making sure every world is just right, THEN you can start teaching them symbolism and all that.",

All the symbolism is VERY obvious and a lot of it isn't even cleaver and literally just based off of the authors life. Like the stuff about the things in the tree? That doesn't have any deep meaning. One of the people who one of the characters is based off of said in an interview that there really was a tree with a bunch of junk in it where they used to live. That's it. And now we're starting to touch upon the problem with some of these highschool classes. They're simply taught wrong. Not everything has meaning,  but everything _represents_ something. The junk in the tree has no meaning, but it is _representative_ of the authors childhood. And as Natsumi is pointing out there, no, the author probably wasn't thinking about anything in particular for this specific instance, but the looming sense of deadlines is probably always there. Most of the Judeo-Christian imagery in Evangelion is functionally meaningless, but it does  _represent_ how foreign and otherworldly it must seem to a Japanese audience since Christianity is a minority religion in Japan seeing it was used for exactly that reason.",

My recommendation is revisit all the books your teachers taught after the age of 25, if you\u2019re that old I strongly recommend reading it again. Particularly catcher in the rye, handmaids tale and 1984 (I sound circlejerky but I\u2019m serious lol)\n\nYou\u2019ll see there\u2019s A LOT more to them that meets the eye. From Holden's hunting hat to boo radley, you\u2019ll see what I mean\n\nEdit: it\u2019s also worth noting literature is an aqiured taste, and you will see stuff only at face value if you\u2019re not interested in studying it, but just reading it for entertainment.",

I can say as a 16 year old that I really appreciate most classic literature. I don't really read them out of my free will, since I read mostly light novels and philosophy and political stuff. \n\nAfter listening to the music of TheFatRat I once really got interested in the Song. I analysed the whole thing(Naturally not professionally, but I looked at the meaning of the song, his life and then went over what the words could mean in relation to the music with the presented image). I got really amazed at how much meaning you can put into just so few words. Afterwards I looked at his other songs with text. Some of them I tried thinking deeply like before as well. Afterwards I could discern that most of his songs had a story that went over just one. I could really see that he tried to make an Universe with the story he told.\n\nThrough that I got to appreciate literature on a whole new level. Interpreting stuff is just such an useful skill in every situation. Since I really am interested in philosophy and politics, interpreting the meaning and message is very interesting and can help understand decisions/agendas from the government way better. Listening to some speeches as a non native english speaker with some understanding how to interpret stuff makes it way simpler as well.",

But i do agree that The Jungle and 1984 are works of genius. I'd say that most of them are, in fact. I just think TKaMB specifically doesn't have nearly as much merit as people think. It has some great lessons on Racism (literally the point of the book) and anything to do with Atticus are the best parts of the story (see the courthouse scenes). But beyond that, it's just kind of a sad-fic written by a woman that isn't a professional writer and was just trying to show everyone how unbearably racist the south was (to the point of a character needing to pretend to be a drunk to get away with marrying a black woman).\n\nNow, admittedly, i was raised multi-cultural, and most importantly, not in the US; so those msgs probably don't resonate with me as much.",

For the dumbest way this can manifest take for example J.K. Rowling\u2019s \u201cclarifications\u201d over the past decade or so on social media about her books. It doesn\u2019t fucking matter if she says that gay dumbledore is in there, it\u2019s not in the text. There\u2019s nothing in those books to support that, which means it\u2019s by definition not there. \n\nSo yeah, stupid framing of an English ( or in this case.... Japanese?) question designed for kids in the school system, but literary analysis isn\u2019t intellectually bankrupt just cause you got a shitty middle school education",

Yea if an author says something is blue chances are he\u2019s not alluding to depression. But if the author spends a whole paragraph describing how something is blue and keeps going back to it you can bet your ass there\u2019s something there. JK Rowling is an aweful example because she\u2019s just a fad novelist. Her book series is good for those that grew up reading it but chances are in time people won\u2019t care. Hell the youth of today already barely cares about Harry Potter. If I\u2019m writing a list of actual literary authors I\u2019m not putting her on there with the likes of Mark Twain or Charles Dickinson. That would be an insult to them.",

I also made it a bit crassly so let me clarify.\n\nUsually , when an author good enough to warrant its inclusion in a school curriculum says their work is about X, I\u2019m not saying it doesn\u2019t warrant looking for X in their work and chances are it will probably be there. \n\nBut that\u2019s more a thing of correlation not to be taken as, although it usually is, causation. In the sense that along side X there could be Y or Z or however many other letters of the alphabet, many of which couldn\u2019t feasibly be expected for an author a given time to know about but exists there regardless of what they could practically intend.\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that when analyzing your own writing, if you\u2019re inclined to try and do that, you might be shit enough at it that not only does the thing you intend to put in there just doesn\u2019t materialize, but something completely different does instead. It\u2019s unlikely such amateurish writing would end up in a school curriculum but it\u2019s still something to keep in mind and is relevant.",

I had the finished one reviewed by a friend who studies literature and well, understandably he had much to criticize. After patching most of it, he said it was decent. Most of the more mature friends I shared the novel with were feeling positive about it as well, but since they probably just don't want to hurt my feelings I will simply see how my perspective in a few years is. \n\nI honestly am just 16, so naturally my novels aren't very good. When I will be aged a bit more, I wil probably look down on them even more. I will just practice until I am 18 and upload novels then to maybe make a living out of it(which is higly improbable with a nearly 0% chance).\n\nTl;dr: Didnt upload them yet, since I am way too young to write something gopd.",

I\u2019m not sure about the 2003 one completely but how his body physically couldn\u2019t sleep on top of how he missed the physical feeling of touch and the warmth from people to make him feel loved and alive that was just missing so he went through a period of not just questioning if he ever existed but if he\u2019s really alive at all.  And the scene highlighted and emphasized as each night in the suit of armor he had to spend alone with himself where he wasn\u2019t able to sleep having to find anything to pass the time and it was wearing him down where each night he questioned his existence without anyone being able to comfort him in the way he needed and his only solace was the morning greetings where he could be relieved that he wasn\u2019t completely alone and trapped within the warmthless world that only he lived in.",

Brotherhood is a more faithful rendition of the manga and done beautifully I might add but both are good in of itself.  But I agree the love story side arc in brotherhood is a reason I like it more but the trapped beyond the veil in the original storyline is also good although a bittersweet ending it makes ya feel the cost of what they do, where each action they took and everything they did had a cost that couldn\u2019t be taken back.",

Square Enix filled in the rest for the first series. They did a pretty decent job, but there was more filler episodes and some inconsistencies in the story as a result.",

Envy kills Ed, but instead of dying, Ed wakes up in our world in London during the first World War, which is also where Hohenheim has been sent. Ed's not in his body, though, he's in the body of his Earth counterpart. Once that counterpart dies, Ed comes back through the gate for some reason. \n\nEnvy hears that Hohenheim is alive on the other side and turns into a giant dragon and flies through the gate.\n\nDante plans to use Al's body, which has been turned into a Philospher's Stone by Scar for some reason, to steal the body of Rose, the girl from Liore who is Ed's love interest for some reason.\n\nDante is stopped, but Al's soul is lost. Ed performs a transmutation to bring him back, which works, but Al comes back as the age he was when he lost his body, with no memory of anything that's happened since. Ed ends up trapped back in our world with Hoheneim. Dante is eaten by Gluttony, who she turned into a mindless eating monster.\n\nThere's a sequel movie where Nazis invade Amestris. A bunch of characters (Hohenheim, Envy, Gluttony, Wrath, etc) show up just briefly enough to be killed off, Maes Hughes' earth counterpart is a Nazi, Fuhrer Bradley's earth counterpart is real life Jewish-German filmmaker Fritz Lang, Al gets his age and memories restored, and also gets trapped in our world with Ed.\n\nIt's all weird.",

I hated how Brotherhood did the DBZ thing where all the side characters just snowball along and just stand around and react to other people fighting. The Ling/Greed storyline was pretty weak. I also feel like the show kept trying to one-up itself. About halfway through the series they're doing things like escaping death by exploiting alchemy. Then they just keep upping the ante; it was hard to stay invested when it was constantly changing the rules.\n\nHonestly, I liked the flask homonculus though. It definitely makes for an interesting antagonist. I think the story structure and tropes are bigger offenders there.",

It deals with extremely heavy themes, allows you time to absorb what's going on, and uses a lot of science to solve fights. It's like comparing Fairytale to Cowboy Bebop",

In the original Mustang was ordered to kill them because they were healing the enemy. It drove him nearly to suicide. He puts the gun in his mouth but is too afraid to do it and that becomes the reason he decides to make it to the top and to no longer follow orders he doesn't believe in again. The scene was dark, somber, and made you question blindly following an unjust military.\n\nIn Brotherhood it was Scar. The bad guy did another bad thing and i couldn't care less if Winry forgave him (why would she?)",

It did a great job of humanizing a lot of the strong characters by showing that they too were once weak and gave into despair like the Elrics, and as a result committed the ultimate sin. Being forced to live with those consequences carries a lot more weight when it comes to characters relating to each other and growing as a result.",

The narrative was aimless and wandering, the glut of tropes hindered the atmosphere, and the power creep was so absurd you couldn't take anyone seriously. It was an above average shonen show, while 2003 was a beautiful action adventure show. I compare them because they're both tv shows? They are comparable, and there is an interest in it. Comparing them reveals more about both of them, and they are closely related. I can do this because I don't have my identity wrapped up in them, so there is no negative. It's a fuckin tv show. I don't care that much about it, but I have an opinion. I stated it without getting butthurt, without being derogatory, and I even said Brotherhood was still exciting. I actually do like the show, but it's issues really drag it down. 2003 has issues, but it's overall a much more focused and interwoven narrative. It's just more compelling. The characters are better developed, they have better motives and goals, and they don't act like anime characters. (as opposed to just characters)\n\n&gt;Why do we have to compare them? \n\nWhat? Why not? Why shouldn't we? Im not getting mad over these shows, but apparently everyone else is. It's the fanboy culture that turns discussions into flamewars and tolerates shitty shows with shitty tropes. And I don't care if you like those shows or not, but you have to acknowledge their flaws and why some, or most, people might not like them.",

Since you don\u2019t identify with the weeb/otaku culture you\u2019re obviously less of an anime fan than everyone else. I doubt you even uguu baka \\*glomp* kekeke dattabayo.\n\nOkay I jest, but in all seriousness I do agree that\u2019s why people get so bent out of shape about these sorts of things. Instead of appreciating it for what it is (a good story that happens to be a cartoon) you get people who like it *primarily* because it\u2019s a cartoon and it just so happens to be one with high production value and a good story. You can\u2019t discuss these things civically with \u201canime\u201d fans because any perceived attack on the show is seen as an attack on them since they like the show and have ingrained it into their identity. It\u2019s really pretty toxic and is why I don\u2019t really talk about anime much with people.",

More and more every year. I love animation, which is why I like to watch these shows, but anime is just full of stupid tropes, weird out of place humor, ridiculous plot breaking weapons/characters/etc, and the general attitude towards women is just sorta...infantilized at best and downright rapey at worst.\n\nFMA 2003 is not free of anime tropes, but I felt like it was way more interesting and less \"anime\" than FMA Brotherhood, so comparing them is a lot more to me than just these two shows, I'm comparing an entire era shift.",

Personally I would say, start with Brotherhood, or heck, start with the manga. Brotherhood is made with the same vision through out the entire run. \n\nAfterwards you can always check the original.\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s bad at all, it certainly has it\u2019s own special things, but personally, Brotherhood is what FMA was supposed to be, and the original series is a twisted and slight inconsistent version of it. Again, not bad, but in my eyes not what the vision behind the series intended to be.",

Well whatever, the comedy was bad too and was used in the wrong moments. It always spammed the whole \"Edward elric is short\" thing so it's like bad. Couldn't even get through 5 episodes.

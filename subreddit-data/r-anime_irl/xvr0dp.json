GS might be comparable by the end of the series, but they're pretty big shoes to fill.",

She said it herself.\n\n*''He's handsome, strong, charismatic, and has a good income, but he flirts with everyone,'*' or something like that, so I'm thinking spearman will mature and grow up, and that side of his personality will change, and he will catch guild girl's eye.\n\nRanger Elf is probably going to end up married to shaman dwarf, as it's common in Japanese works of fiction for two characters who really seem like they don't get along, to end up getting along in the end and getting together as a couple.\n\nThat leaves which girl?\n\nCow girl. She's the childhood friend so she was already almost guarenteed to win from the very start, and she's just so pushy and so posessive, and she won't let any other woman get goblin slayer.\n\nAlso, she lives with her uncle. The guy is muscular and health, but he's old. He won't be around forever. Eventually he will die, and then what? Cow girl is going to end up alone in the farm?\n\nOf course not. She will inherit the farm, marry goblin slayer, and live happy ever after. At least as happy as the people in that messed up world they live in, can live.",

That \"sexual violence\" thing is part of the fantasy setting. Goblins cannot reproduce on their own and so have to use other races (not just humans). Meanwhile, they ravage farmlands and kill males. When I was watching GS, I didn't think in my mind that GS was just about r#pe or whatnot. What was going on in my mind was that goblins must be fucking eradicated for the blight that they are in this fantasy setting. There's also the main lore which is the Sword Hero girl who is the one who defeats the Demon King. Remember, goblins are only a minor problem in this world. They pillage, loot, r#pe, and whatnot. Higher-level adventurers don't waste their time on goblins. That's literally the story of why GS came to be - to kill monsters that others just see as lowly pests. You can think of it as one of those stories where a background character is given the spotlight rather than the main character of the fantasy setting.",

MC just has nothing going on and no real interesting qualities, and anjou seemingly exists to just be constantly hyper sexual with lollipops and such. Just.. eh..\n\nMaybe it gets better after the first few chapters though? Dress up darling definitely has a bit of a rough spot with the measurement chapters, but I feel like it established some wholesome and cute moments early between the two leads which is what drew me in hard",

Like dress up darling has a lot of fan service, but contrasts that with lots of cute wholesome moments. Of the chapters I've read so far it's pretty much just her licking lollipops suggestivesly and suggesting her and the MC bang a lot (as a joke you see) and the main character being very flustered and that's.. sort of it\n\nMaybe it gets good later? idk",

Barely moving. *More* than ready to give up. But I look across the street, and I see that on the other side of the street is my friend's 60-yr-old dad, slowly but surely making progress. I just think to myself, \"I can't let myself lose to this old man,\" and I force myself to at least keep pace with him. \n\nAnd sure enough, a couple hours later I made it to the finish line. Nowhere near the front of the pack, but not too close to the very back either. I never want to do it again, but I'm glad I did it once, and I would have given up if it wasn't for some stubborn pride.",

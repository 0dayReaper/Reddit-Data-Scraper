Become calm and relax, focus on calmness and ignore the unwanted feeling; it is your emotion and as such, your conscious mind has power over it and can quash it. A bit of mental discipline will enable you to tune out unwanted emotions almost entirely.\n\nIt might require a modicum of will power at first, but you'll be surprised at how fast this becomes second nature and even at the very start it won't be that much.\n\nThis also works for most other types of emotions, even physical reactions such as pain to an - admittedly - limited extend.",

You move on to people who you share an interest with or maybe you are part of the same friend group or whatever. You pick one who doesn't strike you as physically attractive or you only use discord cuz you're not well socially initiated (remember the online world is not a real place, so you don't have to care). You hang out and see if you vibe with each other.\n\nNow this is the important part, you already know that there are women/men (whatever way you swing) who you cannot feel attraction towards, not romantic at all. You might feel sexual tension if you are a coomer, but that's a different issue. The reason why you would not get to that point of romantic attraction is that you view them the same way as you view your siblings/cousins. You cannot get actually romantically attracted to those people because there is this whole social network around you that prevents you from going there because that's how your brain is wired. Do not try this with complete strangers, if it was a complete stranger with whom you think your compatible with, your brain will have a hard time not to view them as potential partners. That's why people keep saying men and women cannot be friends. It only works when there is something in place that colours that relationship as a regular friendship",

            "comment": "With regards to the long thread arguing over pedophilia and depiction of adults who have an immature appearance: I am currently 18, when I was 14 people thought I was 20. I have a brother 9 years older than me and people think he is younger because of looks. His wife is the eldest of 3 sisters and is the shortest and least developed of the 3. I have a cousin 3 yrs older than me but people think she is 13. Just because they look drastically underage doesn't mean they are and just because they look mature doesn't mean they are. If I flipped this image to show a girl who is taller with a more developed body you would not have a problem. Then I tell you she is 14. Now you are going to look suspect and start claiming she is overly sexualised. That would then be an insult to all the real people who match that description. We don't control how we look and when we look that way. Claiming this is pedophilia because they look underage is an insult to everyone who genuinely looks that way. Then we also have the reasoning of this being from Japan where people tend to be shorter. Having been to Japan before and returning to study there in the near future, I can state that the vast majority are much shorter than people from where I reside. The average person would be 5 inches taller. This type of thing is unbelievably realistic and you would understand this if you paid attention to different cultures and how societal values and what is considered normal can change based on region.",

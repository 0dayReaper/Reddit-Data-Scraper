Some have commented about jealousy or envy, feeling entitled to what others have. Others have seen loneliness or even depression, talking about a life lacking friendships or connection to others, while others have gone against the grain and spoken about how solitude can bring happiness just as much as companionship. Someone else pointed to the use of the phone and social media, as if she's taking the photo to show the world she's having a great time, when perhaps it was all a fa\u00e7ade.\n\nYou've come the closest to what I was thinking, though. It's not a feeling towards anything in particular, and not a drastic emotion. It's like if you bought a slice of cake and were about to joyfuly eat it, until you saw someone with a slice of cake with a strawberry on top. Your happiness hasn't really been robbed, but there's something in you saying 'why didn't you get to have a strawberry?'\n\nIt's not really envy, fuelled by malice, and your happiness still remains, it just has a slight bitter edge now. It's like the world granted you a gift, and then granted someone else a slghtly better gift. You're still thankful, but... not as thankful as you would be in a vaccuum. It's such a unique emotion.\n\nCute waifu very dank.",

I haven't watched the anime, so I don't know how she behaves after this scene, but putting the phone away can also be interpreted as her treasuring her memory by herself. I think it depends on what side of depression you're on. When you're appreciating being alone, taking a selfie alone is better than taking a selfie with others. And maybe one day you'll take a selfie with others, maybe not, but at least you can enjoy taking one by yourself.\n\nE: That gives a bit of relief imo.",

But then when I see the environments some people grow up in, I'm not surprised that they can't find anyone that they feel like they can get along with. Obviously you'll always have to conform a bit to people, and that helps you grow as a person too, but if you're just in a shitty area with shitty people at your school, then it's nothing to feel bad about. It's unlucky, but if you keep moving you'll end up different places in life and you'll make friends",

The animation's okay, but I really think they made a mistake trying to make it a pseudo-battle anime, instead of focusing on the meat of the plot, which is an interesting dissection of suicide, suicide victims, life in general and moral philosophies around the use and misuse of power.\n\nIt's got such cool themes and absolutely stellar writing, but there's no cool combat (how can you when everyone just gets a Death Note or Love Note glued to their hands?), the pacing is really bad because of the split focus, and ultimately, the last arc was just a roundtable discussion that occasionally changed locations for no real reason.  I loved it, but it was clear that they were moving the conversation just to have something to do, not because it actually contributed to the plot to have the candidates threatened by the ants that are world governments to them.\n\nEnding's really cool, but it's just not their best work (both for the writer in terms of source material, and in terms of having given it to a director with animation but no storyboarding experience)",

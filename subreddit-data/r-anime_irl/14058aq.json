Nothing but drama clickbaity. \n\nBut then...\n\n&gt; The Guardian later reported that \"roughly 100 women have come forward, while 33 of them have composed written statements, supported by emails and text messages, which have been seen by the Guardian\". These testimonials were posted together on a new website, SoManyofUs.com, in July 2020 and contain accounts of \"manipulation, gaslighting, coercion, and other forms of emotional abuse\".\n\nAnd...\n\n&gt; Ellis responded, writing that he had not considered that others would see him as having \"a position of power and privilege\", and that \"I have hurt many people that I had no intention of hurting. I am culpable. I take responsibility for my mistakes. I will do better and for that, I apologize.\"",

This arc culminates in them trying to kill him after **engaging in a threesome with him** in order to lower his guard. Also these two are siblings!&lt;\n\nThe moment was shit the first time (before allegations) I watched because it was one of many twists that season that had basically no foreshadowing and completely flips the motivation of characters for the sake of shock value. It was made even worse the second time (after allegations) do to how eerily similar it was to his real life escapades",

Ash and friends dump barrels of ketchup on the gym trainers who then get the shit kicked out of them by their own raging pokmeon.\n\nAfterwards the gym leaders apologize Ash and friends dump ketchup on the two Pokemon who then run into each other and knock themselves out.\n\nIn the end the \"Mysterious stranger\" who was watching from the sidelines reveals itself to be Nurse Joy who tells the two gyms they're bustas, straight bustas, and don't deserve to be an official gym.\n\nThe episode ends with Team Rocket, soaked in ketchup, being run out of town \n\nThis entire episode is just a Pokemon version of the famous samurai movie Yojimbo which, by extension, makes the episode a Pokemon version of the famous spaghetti western film Fistful of Dollars.\n\nI don't know why I remember all this 20 years later but [Here's the Bulbapedia page for it.](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/EP042)\n\nFun fact:after this episode the Pikachu x Ketchup romance isn't mentioned at all for almost 250 episodes.\n",

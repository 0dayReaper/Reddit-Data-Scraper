Not idol or similar, but you get full on musical numbers where the participants just sing their conversations more often then not.\n\nAnimationwise its really well done and i quite enjoyed it. Though you do have to kinda like musicals to enjoy it. Storywise its CGDCS with yuribait and very light low fantasy elements. If you are into either of those you will probably like it, as productionwise there is nothing to really criticise.\n\nFor the background, the VAs are a Singer group IRL (\"healer girls\") that got their own anime basically where they voice their own characters singing, which is cool.\n\nas an (unsubbed and not really spoilery) example, here is the Ep3 highlight song i found quite good:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aue6KFIQ7C0",

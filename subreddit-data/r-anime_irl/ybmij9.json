We made it that I can say red light just in case I wanna relax and don't wanna be tickled but I haven't laughed for a long time so I just said I'll tell if I need a break from being suddenly tickled. I accidentally banged my head against the wall everytime he surprised me when we were watching video clips etc.. I would also scream if he surprised me and at some point he got a message and fell over from laughing. He knew his neighbor and got a message from him in which he wrote something around:\" Having a great time \ud83d\ude0f?\" I dared him to run with the misunderstanding. I don't really know his neighbor but we both think it is funny. I'm still kinda confused how the surprised scream has been confused for sex noises but idc.  \n\n\nI just noticed.... Do I live in a freaking anime romance comedy with many misunderstandings? Or do people just not get friendships between women and men?",

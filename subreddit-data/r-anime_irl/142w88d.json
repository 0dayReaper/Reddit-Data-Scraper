That is, until he finds a bruise on her face. His worst fears come true when he finds out she has a secret boyfriend...and he's part of a crime ring that's using her to steal her grandparent's wealth. If that wasn't bad enough, the thug catches Tetsuo snooping around and threatens to kill Reika as soon as she gets home.

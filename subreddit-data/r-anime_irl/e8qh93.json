Mornings were fine but god help the teachers that had exhausted students for the periods just before lunch, especially since most of them usually had to be there earlier and stay later.",

Based on what I learned in Chemistry (which I haven't taken in many years admittedly), oxygen bonds with hemoglobin much easier than carbon dioxide does. If hemoglobin is bonded with carbon dioxide and comes in contact with oxygen it will almost certainly react and the oxygen will replace the carbon dioxide. So if you were in a room with normal oxygen levels but all other gases were replaced with carbon dioxide, your oxygen intake should be normal. Why isn't the amount of oxygen in the bubble tracked in this experiment? Are the effects seen in this video really caused by increased levels of carbon dioxide or simply by a decrease of oxygen? It's also possible that the hemoglobin, oxygen, carbon dioxide example we studied in class was a simplification of real life and not applicable here.\n\nI don't know what the point of writing this was. Just sharing my thoughts, I guess...",

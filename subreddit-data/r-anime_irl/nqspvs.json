I imagine that in truth it\u2019s more complicated than that, but I don\u2019t work in animation or computer graphics, I just spend a lot of time looking at them.\n\nBut it\u2019s also a mix. The cgi is pretty obvious when she\u2019s bouncing the ball in the beginning, but the background and the guy are plain-old hand drawn. Animators could have also touched up the final product to make it look more natural, but it\u2019s undoubtedly cgi.\n\nEdit: looking closer I think they might have only cgi\u2019d her body and then drawn her face traditionally, but I\u2019m not really sure.\n\nPlenty of shows do this too. Girls und Panzer is one good example that heavily uses cgi alongside hand-drawn animation. But there are tons of anime that use cgi to support the hand-drawn animation, albeit sparingly, usually where you wouldn\u2019t realize it.",

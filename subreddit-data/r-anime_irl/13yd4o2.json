She was going through Facebook one night bored, thought I looked cute and reached out to talk about movies and music we both had on our profile. I thought she was cute too, invited her up to the radio station I worked at. (I went to a big telecom school. They had their own radio station and tower). We hit it off. Started dating, 15 years later we have three great kids and 10 years of marriage together. \n\nI love cute stories like this little comic. It reminds me of my own. This stuff is real folks!  Don\u2019t lose hope out there, if it can happen to me it can happen to anyone",

It may feel hopeless at times, but keep putting yourself out there. You may get 1000 no\u2019s. But you only need 1 yes. \n\nThose girls won\u2019t know what they\u2019re missing.

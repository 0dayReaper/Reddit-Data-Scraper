It\u2019s rough around the edges at times, it\u2019s ambitiousness led to some issues towards the end, and a few scenes have enough tonal whiplash to decapitate you, but on the whole it\u2019s a really good experience, especially if you\u2019re into visual novels as a genre and have played stuff like  Steins Gate or Rewrite.",

[The new artwork is generally agreed to be worse too.](https://i.imgur.com/4WmijF2.png)\n\nAlso note that later ports of the fan translation don't integrate an IMO effective story arc that was absent in the PC-98 original, only the patch by TLWiki themselves for the old Windows release does. Said Windows port additionally requires a music patch to restore sound quality, but with the available fixes it's pretty much the definitive version.",

Like, for example, \"why does my A/C have to break down on the hottest day of the summer?\"\n\nOf *course* your A/C will break on an incredibly hot day, because that's when it's working the hardest. It's not gonna break in the middle of winter... because you're not using it. So it's not an example of Murphy's Law, it's just a sort of selection bias. Or, I should say, it's a perfect example of Murphy's Law, which itself isn't so much a law of bad luck, but a law of that's-how-things-work.\n\nAnyway, that's been my random tangent.",

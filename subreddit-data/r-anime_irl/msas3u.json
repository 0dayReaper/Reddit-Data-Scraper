Working through that excel sheet or bs essay? Put it on a second screen. You won\u2019t even miss the animation.\n\nEver been disappointed when the first bits of an anime have amazing animation and then crush your soul? No issue here! Not only is the quality ok, but they make great use of what they have.\n\nFinally, refreshing break from a lot of pervert tropes in anime. \n\n8/10, bordering on 8.5/10.",

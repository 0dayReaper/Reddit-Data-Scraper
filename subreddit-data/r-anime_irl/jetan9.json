While I'm improving my healing is rather slow and the first 24 hours were pretty painful (I've had major surgeries before and most were more tolerable than having red teary eyes you can barely keep open long enough to put in the teardrops. Basically 24 hours of non stop burning shampoo in the eye). Totally worth it for me if I end up with 20/20 or better vision, but yeah, the average patient has less issues and faster visual recovery.\n\nThe US doesn't have the newer TransPRK versions yet as far as I understand. Dr. Lin in Vancouver is very well known though and helped develop the newest techniques.",

I do wear glasses again, mainly for reading as I\u2019m almost 50, the main correction is only -0.75. I don\u2019t need glasses for sports and such which was the main benefit in the first place.

Also in some cases only one eye is treated by design so the patient has myopia in one eye and hyperopia in the other. That's usually done for older patients who'll soon develop presbyopia so they can continue to read without glasses. It's called Monovision and the brain usually manages to adjust to it. So I think you should find some place with very little trouble. You'll probably have to pay some stuff twice (like checkup appointments etc).",

I think there's also some anti-fogging sprays you can buy that probably do an even better job.\n\nAlternatively seal the top of the mask to your face with some spirit gum or other adhesive made to attach things to faces, thus ensuring air can't get through the top and has to be redirected out somewhere else. Note that this makes it kind of difficult to take the mask off and you'll likely need an anti adhesive to do so.",

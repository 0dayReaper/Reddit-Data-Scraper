A big fat cockroach lands on my bare stomach. I immediately start trying to hit it but the cockroach is faster and runs around my back with me slapping myself to get the little bugger off me. This went on with the cockroach doing two and half laps from stomach to back to stomach again before I mashed him into cockroach goo. The feeling of it\u2019s little legs running all over me is hard to explain only to say, it\u2019s creepy as fuck.",

A hetero kissing scene may pass but can be risky, because the censors may consider it corrupting for teenagers. The reason that the printing company didn\u2019t want to print the kiss scene may very well be that they know they\u2019d not be able to get approval for printing from the government with that scene.\n\nThere have also been multiple government directives criticizing same sex relationships in the general entertainment industry, such as in TV series and movies. That creates an atmosphere of fear among all publishers. Maybe the government didn\u2019t especially \u201cclamp down hard\u201d compared to normal Chinese standard, and indeed creations further from the mainstream are less pressured, but the pressure faced by Chinese authors are still enormous compared to what most English audience are used to.\n\nThose obstacles make the resilience of the artists that much more moving.",

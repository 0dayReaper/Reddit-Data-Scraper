But cologne swapping will still work in your favor regardless since seasonal vibes are what you can play off of for your scents.\n\nWhat I mean is that, you can do it too, and honestly it's a great confidence booster.",

Full body sweats caused by things like exercise or excessive heat still contain some BO chemicals even if you have the gene.\n\nAlso a decent way to identify if you have the gene or not is to look at your earwax. Another effect the gene has is to make your earwax dry and flaky instead of wet, so that can help you know if you have it or don't.",

It's the [ABCC11 gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCC11).\n\nThough for anyone who thinks they have it I'd warn that it doesn't apply as much to full body sweating (for example from exercise or temperature), so that's something you still need to be aware of.\n\nI know it's saved me a fair bit on daily deodorant usage though!",

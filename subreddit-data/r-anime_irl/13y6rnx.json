As for more frequent repairs? Definitely. The apex seals are known for failing at around 60-80K miles. More expensive though, I'm not so sure. I rebuilt one during a lemons race on a park bench in a little over an hour for about $500 in parts. I think $300 was the apex seals, but don't quote me on that.",

For Nasa, it feels like destiny is finally calling out to him that he will have a girlfriend, but things take a turn for the worse when Nasa is hit by a car and unable to attend his entrance exams.\n\n&gt;After Tsukasa helps the injured Nasa, he confesses his feelings to her, and she agrees to go out with him, but only if Nasa agrees to marry her first.

I've got an '85 RX-7 (daily driver), and I've only lost a pint of oil every 5,000 miles.\n\nNo engine rebuilds either.\n\nThey're ridiculously stable cars if you take care of them. If you treat any car like trash, it'll become trash.\n\nEdit: Fixed typo",

Changing oil every 5,000 was pretty standard for conventional oil, which is what was in common use when the RX-7 was at it's peak.\n\nAs far as other repairs? I haven't had to do a darn thing other than change fluids, and maintain the electrical system (alternator, plugs, wires).\n\nThat's pretty standard. Less than I had to do on my garage-kept '99 Camry.",

(https://www.amazon.com/uni-JETSTREAM-Green-Pencil-Exclusive/dp/B07JGCCJ1X?ref_=ast_sto_dp for example) though the product line is still available online.\n\nI'm more of a fan of the twist version and use a \"Zebra SK-Sharbo+1\" https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W9BYHW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1 which is a little on the thicker side.

It's a sad ending maybe but i feel movie potrays that main character never moved on from his first love, where as in book we can see he did move on but his fear of losing people makes him afraid of opening up to people and that is reason why he fails multiple times. In the end he realizes it and finally \"moves on\". Movie was great but a lot of story was missed. If you want summary of novel Infinitezeinth wrote one on his blog.",

There is absolutely nothing wrong with this woman shouldn't be forced into relationships they don't want to be in like they used to be. Another factor just is with LGBT acceptance, some woman are able to come out as lesbian nowadays when before they would likely be forced to marry a man. Which really is a great thing.\n\nThis isn't all bad, and I used to be a forever alone, always honestly pitying myself. I got into a relationship, and nothing changed I was still sad. I thought it would cause some shift or something, that it was what was missing, it didn't I still was depressed.\n\nPoint is relationships won't really fix anything they are just an added on thing, and getting into a relationship to try and fix something is a bad idea. It's also harder to find a relationship when you are depressed, I mean really would you date somebody who was extremely depressed all day, potentially unemployed, possibly overweight, and just not interesting as a person/potentially even misogynistic (I am not saying this is you, I don't know you at all just that a lot of dudes who are forever alone fit into at least a few of these categories)\n\nIt's sad but it's true, I would stop aiming for a relationship and aim to better yourself, relationships will come with you living your life to its fullest and actively bettering yourself every day, I got into my first real healthy relationship once I started feeling better about myself, more confident, less depressed, having goals in life, etc. I am married now, and honestly happier then ever not because of the relationship although it does bring fulfillment, to share happiness with somebody else, but it is because of working on myself while I was single.",

A woman the large majority of the time literally could not get a job at all, for much of history and all that was expected of woman was to marry a man and have kids. If you were lesbian at the time it might not even be possible to survive without a man, so you would likely have to marry either way, whereas a gay man could get by without marrying, although he may be judged for it.",

I just find it funny, in a morbid kind of way, how many people wail about loneliness on the internet. Specially men.\n\nI believe unhappiness is caused primarily by a lack of perspective on life/philosophical foundation. People don't really know how to be happy, so its not really about what they have or not. Relationships indeed tend to be a common \"scapegoat\" for unhappy people trying to figure out what is wrong.\n\nOff course, good circumstances, or avoiding bad ones, do help, but there are a lot of people who are unhappy with a lot or happy with a little, so evidently there's more to it than one's circumstances.",

It has become a common catchphrase.\n\nUltimately derived from gimoozaabi, an Ojibwe and Potawatomi word that may mean \"he/she looks out in secret\", it is sometimes translated as \"trusty scout\" or \"faithful friend\".In the 2013 film The Lone Ranger, Tonto states that it means \"wrong brother\" in Comanche, a seemingly tongue-in-cheek translation within the context of the plot.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/anime_irl/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

One day Hisao receives a letter from parties unknown in his locker and waits at the written place for the sender. The person who wrote the letter turns out to be his crush; while speaking to her, he suddenly collapses.  He awakes in a hospital bed, and is told by the doctors that the reason he collapsed is due to arrhythmia, a rare heart condition that causes his heartbeat to sometimes become irregular.  Due to this, his parents have enrolled him in Yamaku, a school for disabled students of all kinds.\n\n\n---\n\n^{anime},&amp;#32;&lt;manga&gt;,&amp;#32;]LN[,&amp;#32;|VN|&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/index)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[/r/](http://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[Edit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/index#wiki_i_made_a_mistake.2C_how_do_i_get_my_comment_reprocessed.3F)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[Mistake?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/submit?selftext=true&amp;title=[ISSUE]&amp;text=/r/anime_irl/comments/990bh8/anime_irl/e4kalqg/)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[Source](https://github.com/Nihilate/Roboragi)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[Synonyms](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/synonyms)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[Roboragi&amp;#32;has&amp;#32;moved&amp;#32;to&amp;#32;The&amp;#32;Cloud\u2122!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/comments/8ua44c/roboragi_has_moved_to_the_cloud/)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[\u2665](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/thanks)",

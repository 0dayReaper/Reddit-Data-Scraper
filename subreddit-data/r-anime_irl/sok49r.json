I\u2019ve been reading a lot of romcoms lately so I could come up with one for you in 30 min.... ****BREATHES****\n\nGuy with glasses\u2019 name is Akkun girls name is Kokoro.\n\n*Akkun was again reminded of how he\u2019ll spend Valentines day alone. \u201cChocolates with a heart shaped box... she must be giving it to her boyfriend. Must be nice being him...\u201d. Akkun desperately trying to forget about the girl as he went home, he could not do so. Keys clinging to each other he opened the door. Akkun had received a flyer while he was away and.... **one of the maids on the flyer looked like that girl that just bought chocolates a while ago?!!?** \u201cha... that girl again how unlucky of me. Getting reminded over how I am a lonely weeb?! The love gods must hate me! Just an if but... if she doesn\u2019t have a girlfriend could I meet her again?\u201d Akkun wondered to himself. \u201cNot in a million years will I ever get myself a beauty like he-\u201c* \n\n**BAM** \n\n*\u201cAree~? Oji-san... is that my cafe\u2019s flyer you\u2019ve picked up? Oh the choco I bought from the store you\u2019re working at? I bought it to come up with recipes for this new valentine menu we\u2019re having!\u201d Kokoro answered. \u201cAre you interested in going? I live here right next door to you. I\u2019ve got some spare time early morning tomorrow so want me to show you around the cafe early morning? Oh how could I forget, how rude of me!\u201d Kokoro laughs. \u201cMy name is Kokoro, nice to meet you!\u201d* :)",

So now healthy food tastes like shit AND doesn't have all the vitamins it needs. Thus, we overeat.\n\nOnly way to combat this is to really watch labels and build a healthy menu that focuses on good macros and micronutrients.\n\nOur problem isn't discipline, as people used to be thin before food got fucked. Our problem is we are now required to focus on labels to get what we need, or else we fuck up and fatten up.\n\nOnce you crack your menu, losing weight is easy. I'm undeeight on purpose right now (like many celebs), and easily.",

They look nothing like bodybuilders - they aren\u2019t chiseled and completely fat-free, but rather the opposite. When having to lift heavy loads, you don\u2019t want a skinny waist; you need to build up muscles that go through the torso, building up the core strength needed to lift those huge weights without damaging their spine or herniating internal organs. Plus, putting on a lot of muscle bulk without fat in a short period of time is often indicative of steroid use.\n\nTL;DR - bodybuilders often have a \u201ctriangular\u201d body shape (bulky arms and chest, narrow midriff), while strongmen have a \u201crectangular\u201d body shape with uniform muscle development and loads of core strength. The former is for show at bodybuilding competitions, the latter is for lifting boulders and fighting bears on the tops of mountains.",

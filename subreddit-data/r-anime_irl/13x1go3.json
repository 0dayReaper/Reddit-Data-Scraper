Somehow, if you read long enough you can imagine how they would sound like if they ever got animated, but unfortunately, the anime wasnt how i imagine it would be. The anime is still decent though. It is just nitpick on part since I really enjoy the source material so much.",

His fullfillment of being wanted and not feeling afraid or that his existence annoys everyone is sort of cured by Kubo. Its very sweet :)",

I was kind of like Kubo, as in I would go and talk to those who would stay in class on their own. I found it nice because I was curious about them. I on the other hand, always held presence wherever I went. I found them intriguing and I have always wanted to be mysterious and dark haha I literally am still like that, as in wanting to remain anonymous. But I end up having a presence. This might have a lot of psychology into play, which I would get into but it is going to really long. Briefly, I think I was trying to tell the world to notice me as I am, I wanted someone to look at me and find me the same way I would find someone like Shiraishi. I wanted to be found in that manner.",

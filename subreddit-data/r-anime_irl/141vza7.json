Thus she is likely the equivalent of a 20 year old virgin, for her species.   \nafter that it's a little hard to extrapolate extra information without more details. perhaps her species is compelled to engage in child production at an early age or perhaps there is some sort of cultural reason for them to engage in sex from the age of sexual maturation.",

So now if you're going to be eternally some age, the correct age to be eternally is 17. And if you make a character who is eternally 17, everyone knows that you're making a reference to that meme.",

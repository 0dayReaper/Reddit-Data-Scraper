It can be really difficult to tell the age of an anime just by style alone.\n\nGood animation is simply timeless.\n\nA great example is Sleeping Beauty. One of Disney's most detailed works that stands up to the Renaissance era movies without breaking a sweat.",

Motion blur is a tool to try and deal with the problem that low static refresh rates imagery causes with visual processing. Once you have static refresh rates over a certain threshold, motion blur is not only not required, its arguably actively bad.\n\nBasically, its a hack to try and make low refresh rate not total garbage\n\n&gt;  It is a rare genetic anomaly for a person to have ultra-high frame-rate vision.\n\nThis is flat out incorrect. You are just **acclimated** to low refresh rates and motion blurring. Spend an hour or so on a high refresh rate display doing literally anything, and everything else will look and feel like a god-damn slide-show afterwards until you get re-acclimated to low frame-rates. Standard film looks a blurry, choppy mess. You know, like what it is.\n\n\nCase in point: Gemini Man. The drastically increased frame rate feels alien to many people. But to a lot of perople, like PC gamers, its was like 'holy shit its not complete garbage'",

You are just acclimated to low refresh rates. \n\nSpend an hour or so on a high refresh rate display doing literally anything, and everything else will look and feel like a slide-show afterwards until you get re-acclimated to low refresh rates. Standard film (which is a god-awful 20ish FPS) looks a blurry, choppy mess. You know, like what it is.\n\nI spend all my time on 120hz+ displays. Basically any time I watch a movie, its almost painful because of what a stuttery, blurry mess it is by comparison. I always have one thought: fuck-tuple the frames please. \n\nI remember when 'Gemini Man' came out (and to a lesser extent the hobbit and avatar) and I was super stoke that this might finally be the start of a the film industry finally entering the 21st century. Nope. Fuck you. 20 fps vomit blender, take it or leave it *sad lol*",

However the wizard and the glasses girl fall in love and have an affair. Jealous guy, after learning of the affair, kills glasses girl and himself. The grieving wizard, at the cost of his life, performed a forbidden ritual to resurrect them. This results in the three being reincarnated in modern Japan, with only the wizard retaining his past life's memories. Modern day glasses girl was the one who pursued him, with him initially resisting her.

People might have different preferences for nose shapes and sizes for example. But almost no one will say that crooked misshaped nose is beautiful, and those who do will likely be lying.   \n  \nWhat you are trying to do is to replace the definition by claiming different meaning to already existing one. When someone uses expression \"they are beautiful\", no one is going to think \"Oh, I wonder what they are talking about\", everyone will clearly know it is about appearance, because there is established norm for meaning of the word.",

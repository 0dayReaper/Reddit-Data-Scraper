The couples are very realistic, you get to watch all of the relationships develop, how each person has a different way of expressing their emotions and romance, the anxieties of being in a relationship and that age old thought of \"are they upset with me or is it something completely separate from the relationship that is stressing them out,\" and how a healthy relationship also requires you to be as much of a close friend as a romantic partner. It's one of my favorite anime and manga and I want it to get a second season and not just a series of OVAs, especially as it just finished up and will be getting a spinoff manga next. It also has more than enough content to get a second season now, as the anime only covers the first two US volumes of five.",

It can be done, though, you just have to introduce external conflict to keep things interesting like a particular manga that has a popular anime airing at the moment. \n\nHorimiya probably could've kept things interesting if the author followed through on the side character's arcs, which were much more interesting than horimiya's after they got together.

Well, the MCs story did slow down and the side characters were in spotlight. However, there still were great moments after they got together. It showed that relationships do not always go smoothly after getting together, especially with families with expectations. It explored the human condition and I think it doing that is pretty cool. Some did say that they thought the manga peaked during their confession, but I honestly think it just got better. I will never regret reading the manga. \n\nNow, its culminating into a complete story with completed character arcs. If they ended with the confession, the character arcs eluded since the beginning wouldn't have been tied up. They grew up even after going together. I just love the story, if you can't infer that yet xD",

                            "comment": "He wanted to prevent a very imminent Civil War between his clan and the village they lived in, so he killed everyone in his family except for his very young little brother, whom the village leaders agreed to leave alone if Itachi massacred his family. Itachi wanted everyone to believe his family was honorable, so he told his little brother that the slaughter was just a way for Itachi to test his strength (the village leaders didn't want to be blamed for wiping out a resident clan preemptively, so they allowed this lie to stand). \n\nBefore fleeing the village as an exile, Itachi told his brother that he was too weak to be worth killing, and he challenged the boy to get stronger. Ostensibly this was a challenge for a future fight, but really this was a way for Itachi to motivate his brother to go on living and to become strong enough to protect himself in case anything prevented Itachi from protecting the boy from behind the scenes. Itachi also kinda wanted to die at the hands of a family member as a penance for killing his very loving parents. \n\nItachi then went into exile and began working for a terrorist organization as a spy for his village. At one point he needed to come back home with his new criminal partner for a terrorist mission, but he was noticed by his little brother before the mission was concluded. To disable his brother non-lethally and to preserve his cover as a terrorist, Itachi made use of his magic eyes (a family trait, they appear after significant trauma and grow stronger with use before ultimately deteriorating from overuse), to hypnotize the boy into  rewatching the death of their parents on repeat many hundreds of times. \n\nItachi repeated his challenge to his brother before leaving. He also told his brother that his intention in sparing and torturing him was to have his brother get strong enough to develop his own magical eyes that Itachi could use to replace his own deteriorating pair. When the fully developed magic eyes are transplanted from one sibling to another, they become immune to deterioration. This was a clever lie that kept Itachi's cover intact, explained away his refusal to kill his brother after having already killed the rest of the family, and hinted to the brother that he could actually claim Itachi's eyes for a power boost once he became strong enough to exact revenge. \n\nThe brother went into turbo training montage mode, leaving the village to train with a snake-themed ninja exile who promised power in exchange for the right to possess the boy's body at some point (the snake dude needed to swap bodies every so often to maintain his pseudo immortality). Eventually the brother learned all he could, and he betrayed the snake dude right when body-snatching time came around (snake dude was weakest at this point). He killed snake dude and absorbed his soul, which granted a power boost at the cost of having snake dude constantly trying to break free and possess the boy.\n\nWhen the brother finally tracked Itachi down, Itachi baited his brother into a fight but held back enough to drag things out. This way the brother became exhausted, too exhausted to keep snake dude's spirit in check. This gave Itachi an opportunity to permanently exorcise the snake dude from the brother's body (saving his brother from being possessed permanently if he ever got exhausted without a strong friend nearby). Then Itachi allowed his brother to mortally wound him; but on his way off the mortal coil, he fucked with his brother's head by tapping him on the forehead affectionately like they had done as kids. \n\nThe brother didn't accept a transplant of his brother's eyes right away, though he did eventually do so. Unfortunately, he also learned the truth about his family's massacre and now wanted to destroy the village his family had lived in. Itachi had another trick prepared for exactly this situation. Itachi had programmed a hypnosis spell to trigger if his brother's best friend ever saw Itachi's eyes in person (the spell was prepared with a dead friend's magic eyes that had been implanted in a crow that Itachi somehow sealed inside his brother's friend), the spell would make whomever it targeted (presumably Itachi's brother) permanently loyal to the village. This was a backup plan for if the brother had killed Itachi, taken his eyes, learned the truth about the massacre of his family, and went rogue (exactly what happened). The plan didn't work because plot shenanigans, but it's demonstrative of the elaborate 4-D mind fuckery he planned on a routine basis. \n\nEdit: cleaned up some grammar and tried to make a few things clearer. For fans, I know I'm not using the show's language, like \"genjutsu\" or \"sharingan;\" but that's intentional to make things easier for non-fans to understand.",

The art is great and very clean, with the right amount of dialogue in my opinion. The way I see it, when they were top 3, Bleach has the cleanest slickest art and shows more in action by drawing, One Piece has a lot of dialogue though it's sorta necessary since Oda is very detail oriented and with the limit of pages, he can't draw everything so he tells it in text. I find Naruto is a nice cool balance between the previous two.\n\nSorry for the wall of text lol but Naruto is one of my favorite mangas and I'm not trying to force you but if this piques your interest even a little bit, I'm sure you'll enjoy reading it.

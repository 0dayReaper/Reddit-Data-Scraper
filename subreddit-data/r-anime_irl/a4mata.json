Every moving object looks like it's being smeared across your eyes and the tracking on the controllers and the headset is vomit inducing. \n\nI've been using VR for a half decade now. I was a kickstarter backer for the original Rift and I can say with authority if you're looking for the full VR experience to get an HTC Vive.

If you get really into it you might want to try to pick up a 1070 Ti ($350-400) or a used 1070 ($250ish?).\n\n There are also new AMD cards coming out at the start of next year, and that should lower GPU prices a bit too. So there's no harm in waiting for a new graphics card if you like VR and want to upgrade to run games better",

The Vive is considered the best but it's a fiddly setup and the lenses/screen are subpar (at least on non-pro version). There are 3rd party lenses which are apparently better but I've not tried them yet.\n\nThe current controllers limit what kind of gestures you can do, the Valve Knuckles will be an improvement to this but no idea when those will be releasing and they'll probably be something like \u00a3200 on their own.\n\nFor anyone that hasn't yet tried VR and is thinking about it, I'd suggest waiting a few years at least for more competition in the market so that companies like HTC can't keep doing these scammy practises.",

This causes a pre-programmed animation to occur, which in this case turns on the gun, the badge, and triggers another animation that causes the diffuse texture tint from blue to red over and over. It also changes the blendshapes on the face and the rotation/position of the bones for the ear rigging.\n\nThe eyes are moving because VRChat has built-in eye tracking-- its not ACTUAL eye tracking (eventually!) but it is a built-in script that does pretty okay at looking at users that are talking/nearby/etc.\n\nSource: I work for VRChat \ud83d\ude43\n\nFYI, VRC is free and you can play VRC on Desktop without a VR headset, although it is definitely an entirely different experience with VR.",

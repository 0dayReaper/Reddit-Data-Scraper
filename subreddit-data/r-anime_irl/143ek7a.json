I know translators get a lot of flack for how they portray dialects, but Marin\u2019s dialogue worked surprisingly well.\n\nNot only that, they were meticulous with translating the posters in her room, the loaded diagrams of the cosplays. Crunchyroll subs aren\u2019 always perfect, but they knocked it out of the park with this show.",

Is it friend chocolate or obligation chocolate or is it for genuine affection?). It's not conceptually hard to follow, but the notes explaining some of that nuance (or that the holiday is split into two with one for girls and one for boys) were super helpful the first time around (and why the heroine was working so hard to make the damn stuff).  \n\nI know I'm typically not gonna pause and google something mid show, so having slightly more than just \"this must just be some cultural difference thing I dont get\" was always nice\n\nNot to get too \"back in my day\" but I wonder how well (or not) some of those concepts get translated to the modern viewer because you don't typically see big explanations in the official translations that you used to get in all the pirate media",

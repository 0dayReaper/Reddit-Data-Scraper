Stand still near the center of the room until Sly jumps toward you. Dash to avoid the buzz saw attack and then, after a quick beat, about-face and walk toward him to hit him.\n\n2. If you get hit by the buzz saw attack, don't back out. Just go ham on Sly until he dashes away again. Your damage i-frames will cover the rest of the attack so you can get a bunch of hits (especially with Quick Slash).",

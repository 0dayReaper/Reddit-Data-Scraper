They can only only penetrate about 1cm into an object placed inside of a microwave oven.\n\nWhat is more likely happening is that dildo material radiates heat faster than it conducts it, while also be good at storing heat. Cast iron would be a good example of material with properties like this (just in general, not in terms of dildos); it stores and radiates heat extremely well, but it's relatively shit at conducting it.\n\nSo what happens is you load the dildo up with heat, but in the interim between microwaving it and inserting it the heat at the surface, and only the surface, has been conducted away - while the heat in the core remains. This core heat would then be left to radiate out, rather than be conducted out, and potentially could cause burns.\n\nTl;dr - it isn't 'microwaving' the dildo that's unsafe, but just heating it in general. You could hear it up in a water bath and end up with the same potentially unsafe conditions. Some materials will just do this, and the method of heating makes no difference.",

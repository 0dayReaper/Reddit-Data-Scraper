Using them to know where a baseball pitch is coming or to cheat on tests. \n\n&gt;for some reason it hits just right for me, I love it.\n\n&gt;Need to rewatch it and figure out what it is. Nostalgia? Good mc?\n\nFor me it's (major plot spoilers) &gt;!the pacing and the way the MC's personality develops over the movie.  There is very little action in the movie but the stakes are just constantly being raised a little bit, going from nonchalantly using her time travel powers for dumb selfish shit, realizing her powers are limited and running out, transitioning to trying to use her powers in more meaningful ways to help other people, then the whole deal with her last \"jump\"...  It all just transitions so well from one thing to the next without self-narration or preaching, just facial expressions and body language.  Also that bittersweet ending scene at the river.  The MC goes back in time dozens of times to change things for herself but realizes what she really wants too late and doesn't get the ending that she wanted.  She seemingly manages to set everything right and she's waiting for things to play out like they did at the river earlier in the movie, but the conversation goes in a different direction and she is left sobbing alone on the bike path with no more time-travel do-overs left to try again.  She undid that very moment half a dozen times earlier in the movie and now when she really wanted it to play out it didn't.  It just hits hard after watching the MC grow as a character, become less selfish and more mature and aware of how her actions affect other people.  You are rooting for her at that point but she ends up setting things right for everybody BUT herself and ends up standing there sobbing.!&lt;\n\n\nSome people say the plot twist that comes 2/3 of the way through the movie is dumb and yeah the motivation for that character being there *is* kind of weak but I think it's easy to give that plot point a pass.  It's easy to understand why someone living in a post-apocalyptic society might want to go back in time to experience pre-apocalypyic society, so even though the explaination they give is kind of bizarre, it's easy to just look past it imo.",

Spoilers, but  &gt;!the twist ending is kind of an ass-pull, it comes out of nowhere and doesn't really make sense on second viewing.!&lt;",

He stayed outside waiting for his friends to finish the exam, then he came back into the class after it was done trying to get his exam back because he didn't check the last back of the exam.\n\nBut I also did it once, but it felt like cheating. 2 hours exam, we could leave after 45 minutes. I finished the exam in 35 minutes. The \"cheat\" is that I felt like the exercises the teacher was giving us were too rudimentary, and normally exam questions mix 2-3 topics together, so I googled for questions online on the topic and solved those, and 2 of the big questions in the exam were almost identical to the ones I did online, just numbers changed or configuration slightly changed but the logic stayed the same, and the rest was just easy. I reviewed the exam like 3 times and I was at the point that I was starting to question what I was sure was correct, so I just turned it in, but the TA was like \"You're gonna have to wait 10 minutes at your desk, you sure about that?\" and then the teacher came in, since he was going between 2 classes ('cause big group), asked me the same thing, checked my exam quickly, then he took me aside and asked me if I thought the exam was too easy, and I sure as fuck wasn't going to be the one telling him it was.",

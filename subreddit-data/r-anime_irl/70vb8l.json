Usually involves eyes partially rolled back.\n\n* Futa: A female character with both a penis and a vagina.  \n\n* Boi: Not anime-specific.  Slang term to refer to another person (i.e. boy).\n\n* Enkidu, Astolfo, D'Eon: Characters from the Fate franchise, specifically the mobile game Fate/Grand Order.

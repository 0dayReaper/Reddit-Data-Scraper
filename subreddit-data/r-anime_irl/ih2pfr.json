Especially when there isn't a general consensus about a show being bad.\n\nPersonally I couldn't stand watching Bofuri. It was bland, cheesy, tropey and boring. Most things felt recycled. But it was a pretty innocent show that did no harm to anyone, so shitting on it will not leave everyone happy.",

Aqua is a living incarnation all sexist stereotypes associated with women; naggy, dumb, hysterical, useless, but still being objectified as a sex object.\n3. Darkness has only a single character trait, masochism, which is showcased every ten seconds she's on screen.\n4. Megumin is a chuni sex object that appeals to the audience's creepy ephebophile fantasies.\n5. EVERY FUCKING JOKE IS DELIVERED WITH THE SUBTELY OF A FUCKING FRIEGHT TRAIN.\n6. It continues the time honored Isekai tradition of having the least interesting JRPG world ever made.\n7. The amount of sexualization of every female character is obnoxious and just continues to jerk off the audience.\n8. Kazuma sexually assaults people and gets away with it.\n9. It spawned an endless wave of dipshit social rejects reposting the \"I yearn for true gender equality\" line in order to justify violence against women.\n10. It fails at being satire because it embraces the tropes found in all Isekai shows with no subtle or blatant criticism.\n11. It fails at being a gag comedy due to how unfunny, slow, and lame all it's jokes are.\n12. It fails at being an Isekai because the show's world plays second fiddle to the perversions of the shows audience and writer, along with a lack of plot.\n13. Darkness's masochism is the 5-year-old version of masochism that does not and never will exist in real life.\n14. Aqua should deeply resent and hate Kazuma for ruining her life, but likes him after a montage. This tells the audience that negatively impacting people's lives isn't permanent, reinforcing a juvenile view of relationships.\n15. The sex related comedy in the show isn't even good sex comedy, unless your a 13-year-old. So any adults finding this garbage funny should just admit their lack of maturity.\n16. Once again, this crap takes 2 minutes to spell out a joke like \"WOAH SHE'S GIT BIG BOOBS!!!!!!\" or \"WHAAAT! THE LADY WITH BIG BOOBIES ALSO HAS PEENER!!!! I'M SCARED OF THOSE!\"\n17. So much loli shit that I feel bad for the audience's parents.\n18. Kazuma's personality is lame, his design is lame, and all the dipshits who quote him are lame.\n19. All other male characters are consistently viewed as threats to Kazuma's harem, further pushing the toxic masculine theme of endless competition and distrust amongst peers.\n20. The animation is cheap looking.\n21. Kazuma realistically should be a socially awkward weirdo with no ability to speak to women. BUT since this show is a power fantasy, he's actually an \"epic\" sex offender and abuser.\n22. This show is demeaning to women.\n23. Liking this show should be embarrassing to anyone above the age of 18.\n24. The 2nd season has this arc about a scam religion, and spends around 24 GODDAMN MINUTES TELLING THE AUDIENCE THAT FACT.\n25. The sheer amount of psycho-sexual pathology surrounding the fanbase makes me sick.\n26. Is a horrible intro show to anime for anyone who isn't a teenage white kid.\n27. Every meme I accidentally see involving the show's characters only make me hate it's western fans more.\n28. Every female character is endlessly dependent on the help of the male MC.\n29. Liz is the lamest do-nothing character ever, her only character trait is large boobs, kill me.\n30. Yun-yun is another gross character designed to appeal to the audience. Much akin to Aqua, her being a perpetual loser only continues to make the audience jack off to how lame and pitiful women are.",

My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest.\n\nI don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up.\n\nI'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness.\n\n#Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.",

It would be far more interesting as a true whodunnit, rather than some teen detective drama. \n\nImagine if Perfect Blue had reincarnated fan-children delivering all of the exposition, rather than just letting the scenes speak for themselves. \n\nI also think the intro is the worst Yaosobi song by some margin lol. I really like a lot of their other music, but Idol is an instant-skip if it comes up.",

                            "comment": "it's a lengthy hentai doujin about a nerdy-looking girl who decided to become more stylish when she started high school. it turned out she became really pretty and she started making new friends. she got along with wrong people and naively allowed herself to get dragged into drugs and prostitution. from there, her life spirals out of control as she experiences the worst horrors humanity has to offer to someone people pay to have sex with. by the end of it she is unrecognizable compared to both the middle school nerd and the beauty from early high school. she becomes pregnant from one of the experiences and sees her life isn't one worth living anymore and ODs in the end. \n\nit's more depressing than disgusting. back in my more curious years i looked up the numbers being thrown around places like anime memes subreddit and discovered that, while 177013 is fairly known, there are far worse horrors produced by the minds of humans and my fragile mind cannot comprehend the mental state the artist must be in to produce said horrors. i will not share further info nor the numbers etched into my brain for the good of the reader of this comment.\n\nside note: someome made an alternate ending for 177013 where the main character from jojo part 4 (who has the ability to fix and heal) restores the protagonist from the hentai doujin and she is shown returned to a normal life with her kid later. many people refuse to believe that anything other than this is the canon ending to the original stoty.",

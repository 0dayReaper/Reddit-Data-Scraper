It's okay even if you are disappointed. Once you know your own size, you'll know what you should do. and once you understand yourself, what you want to do gradually comes into focus.\"",

Like a theoretical midpoint between the two. Sometimes romantic, sometimes sports competitive, sometimes family drama, etc. Very good at truly capturing the lives of all (and I do mean *all*) the characters involved. No one is two dimensionally written, or flat. Everyone has an arc, a back story, motivation, and time spent exploring them. Honestly it's nuts how much time and detail is given to everyone. And it never feels forced, or campy, or melodramatic with long-winded speeches delivered mid tearful performance or anything. Not to mention, the animation is incredible to look at.",

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.\"",

With the manga,  you get more inner thoughts from everyone. I feel that the story gets even better after the animes stopping point. I really hope they make a third and plus seasons of it. Its still on going and I look forward to each new chapter every month. I hope you enjoy it so much I do. :)",

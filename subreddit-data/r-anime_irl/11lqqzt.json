Anything bigger, unless you're like... doll hands... then measure using the bottom of a small cast iron pan.  If the breast fits, it's normal.

Idk if that even makes sense to say, idk if tenderizing would make more juice drip out or if you should just keep it like it is. I was a line cook not a chef.

A large chicken breast is from a roided up chad chicken and will often have slightly more fat it will probably be around 10oz.  \nIts actually less about organic vs roids and more about chicken breeds.  \n\nThats about 140g and 280g respectively for the losers who can't type a conversion into google.",

Their supplier sources some big-ass chickens, but usually chicken farms prefer to produce more, smaller chickens because of a number of factors related to time and expense. So if you're using regular supermarket chicken, they're probably not large. Which means if you did come across some large ones, you'd probably notice that they're bigger than expected.",

Breasts are also the word describing her chest, she misunderstood what breast the recipe meant because it did not specify \"chicken breast\", choosing to just say breasts, she therefore thought it meant her breasts instead of the chicken. Her chest is large so she decided to cook it for 30 minutes despite the size of her chest having nothing to do with how long to cook the chicken. It isn't the funniest but its charming enough and this whole sub is super horny for anything involving hot girls so it'll get like 40k upvotes.",

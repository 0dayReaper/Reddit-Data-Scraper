Only 3% of the animals in zoos are in danger. All of the zoos hire people that hunt and steal animal from reservates that are made to keep animals in a safe place in the country they are living. Also I saw some comment talking about aquazoos and such stuff, they are much worser. All of those animals/fishes die earlier as in nature, they all get sick because of the aquarium is to small. Big fish like shark, orca, dolphins all at risk in a aquazoo, they get fungal disease and bite the cement until the teeth are destroyed. They put fish together that don't live in nature together, also having an aquarium at home is wrong. You go and buy a fish because you think its cute/beautiful without knowing it's proably at extincting in the home country and it happens, because those guys go n catch ~100 fish and then only like ~13 will reach your country the others died on the way. We have around the world the wrong measurements on how big a \"cage\" needs to be, even germany with the biggest laws on animal rights is doing almost everything wrong. If anyone of you don't belive me you can test it yourself go to any zoo and look at the same animal for 5-10minutes, maybe record it and watch it at home. You will see that it's moving in circles or doing other reapeating stuff, because it can't leave and is sad/depressed. Sharks have a humpback very often because they attack the glass often, maybe you already saw/heard about apes throwing their own shit at people, because they are stressed. Imagine someone would follow you everyday, its called a stalker right? The same thibg happens to animals in zoos but instand of one person following you everyday its a bunch of people and they are loud etc.\n\nNow enjoy your meme and keep this in mind.",

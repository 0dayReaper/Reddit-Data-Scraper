But I can't have my window open there since it's just next to the main entrance, outside of which the two of them also frequently smoke.

None of that \"it'll only hurt me later\" or \"it doesn't affect you\" stuff. Smoking has real harmful progressive effects; it's not just something that could harm someone later on in life. And in some studies, passive smoking (i.e. inhaling smoke from someone else) has been shown to be even more harmful. I wish you all the best.\n\nIf it were me, I'd prefer going to boarding school or a dorm tbh. My lungs can't take it.",

She's a seriously heavy smoker and her mother died around the age that she is now (I think it was for smoking related reasons but I don't quite remember, it happened before I was born), so I don't know if she'll even have time to quit even if she puts her mind to it. My sister, I'm not sure if she'll ever attempt to quit. She seems to have more self control, but she's also a bigger defender of smoking as opposed to my mom who admits it's bad.\n\nI'm really looking forward to getting my own place and being able to breathe my own fresh air, and without having to go and buy cigs for the two of them every week. Makes me feel like shit for helping them slowly smoke themselves to death. The cashiers at the local supermarkets must think I'm a really heavy smoker lol",

Even in the summer in 100\u00b0 heat I'd smother myself with a blanket to avoid the smoke.\n\nEventually when I was in middle school I started having really bad breathing and general health problems. Finally my dad started smoking less. I don't remember most of what happened but he barely smokes a pack a month now if that, compared to a pack every other day before. Docs never diagnosed any of the various problems as anything but stress, though I think my mom is responsible for my dad stopping.\n\nEver since those years I've had a very diminished sense of smell. It's not gone or anything but barely there. I know when I was a little kid I loved smelling flowers and such that I get pretty much no smell from now. Only a few things, like cooking meat and dirty diapers, register. Apparently I don't smell weed too, as I didn't know some customers were drenched with the smell until my boss asked me how I tolerated it after they left.\n\nWhat I do have since those years, is very adverse reactions to smoke. As in physically sick. It was bad enough at work that I essentially lost access to the back rooms whenever coworkers smoked outside the back, and that same time with the weed smoking customers I mentioned I got sent home for degrading into headaches and nausea within half an hour. In that case I started getting sick before I was asked if I smelled it and this became aware. Vape isn't nearly so bad, but one day some guy at my university blew some at my face, as a \"favour\", and I missed the start of the next class from nausea.",

A simple \u201cno\u201d does just fine in these situations. If they ask, they\u2019re being considerate and are obviously mindful about the detriments of second-hand smoking (and obviously on themselves). Forgive me if this is harsh, but replying like this makes you an asshole. Not only that, by being an asshole, you\u2019re giving smokers a point to rationalize their smoking. When, at any point in any topic, has being an asshole ever persuaded anyone to change their ways. If you argue against a homophobe by saying \u201cstupid bigot go fuck yourself\u201d: congratulations, they now are wholly less likely to listen to you and your very valid and respectable point of not being homophobic.\n\nIf you ask them to stop smoking in your presence and they don\u2019t stop, sure, go off on them, they\u2019ve earned it. But if you can\u2019t contain your immense, childish hatred at them merely being respectful? You\u2019re just proving you have even less restraint than they do.",

A 50 year habit is hard to completely unroot.\n\nI\u2019ve been in more than enough discussions on the topic. At least, enough to expect this reaction. Their feelings are justified even if the way they channel it is wrong. They don\u2019t realize how their lack of restraint for their hate is similar to smoking.\n\nIn any case, good luck on quitting. My mother quit, though admittedly my father\u2019s passing was the final kick that did her addiction in. Its possible, here\u2019s to hoping you don\u2019t need as harsh of a motivator.",

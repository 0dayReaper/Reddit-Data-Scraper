A romantic comedy in an office setting that takes coworkers to lovers to new heights within a winter wonderland of emotions!\n\n&gt;Himuro is a modern-day ice god, an ordinary office worker who just so happens to be the descendant of a snow spirit. He's also besotted with his coworker Fuyutsuki, who's a little unusual herself. At first glance, the pair both seem to be calm, cool, and collected. But beneath Himuro's icy good looks rages a passionate blizzard of love! On the other hand, his coworker's cool facade belies nothing about any feelings she might have for Himuro in return\u2060-because she's too oblivious to realize anything! What's a snowman in love to do?\n\n&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: Originally uploaded to Twitter, after nine chapters it was serialized by GANGANpixiv, where it is being republished and now continues.&lt;/i&gt;\n\n\n---\n\n^{anime},&amp;#32;&lt;manga&gt;,&amp;#32;]LN[,&amp;#32;|VN|&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/index)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[/r/](http://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[Edit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/index#wiki_i_made_a_mistake.2C_how_do_i_get_my_comment_reprocessed.3F)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[Mistake?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/submit?selftext=true&amp;title=[ISSUE]&amp;text=/r/anime_irl/comments/1408bjs/anime_irl/jmuh8wp/)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[Source](https://github.com/Nihilate/Roboragi)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[Synonyms](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/synonyms)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[\u26d3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/interestinglinks)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[\u2665](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/thanks)",

Alot of series like that are aimed at middle/high schoolers, so it kind of makes sense to make the characters roughly the age of your target demographic.\n\nLike, would kids have related to Harry Potter originally as much if they started the first book at ~18?

He\u2019s still treated as a kid in the show and it would be fucking weird for a 24 year old to be traveling with two ten year olds; I\u2019d say he\u2019s 15 at the oldest",

For thousands of years \"men\" have been expected to do physical work as soon as they are able, for example, chimney sweeps in Britain would frequently start aged SIX. Various militaries have also drafted these boys as young as they feel they can, and deliberately had lax checks on whether new recruits actually are the age they claim to be (WW1 is very notable for this). I can only imagine the same is true throughout all of human history, because it just makes sense to get people working ASAP when that might be the difference for a family between starvation and survival.",

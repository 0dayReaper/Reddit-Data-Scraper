Russia, Cuba, Pre-Deng Xiaoping China, Venezuela, and, yes, North Korea are all communist societies. These are all the result of attempts at the ideal of communism. A noble goal and desirable ideal: A society free from inequality and a good modest living for all. But whenever communism is attempted, it always leads to the death of hundreds of thousands, if not millions. \n\nCapitalism doesn't have examples like that. Evils have certainly happened under capitalism, but not nearly to the same extent.",

What events or practices? It's raised the standard of living across the world and lifted billions out of poverty. \n\n[This Graph](https://i.imgur.com/CVq9bXF.png) shows the result of the free market and the industrial revolution on a few countries. The Industrial revolution was only able to grow at the pace it did because of the innovation incentivized by the free market system, and even then it's effects weren't felt everywhere. Japan/Italy didn't grow out of poverty until their totalitarian regimes fell and they were liberalized post WWII. Communist China didn't start growing out of poverty until Deng Xiaoping opened up special economic zones to the free market. The United States, and to a lesser extent the United Kingdom, were able to grow in wealth rapidly because the market was free to thrive in those countries.",

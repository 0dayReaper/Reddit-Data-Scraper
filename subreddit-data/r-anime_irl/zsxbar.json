A *lot* of people, more than you might think, are virgins. Some have no desire to change that fact. \n\nBetween all the crisis going on, the impending doom of humanity through climate change, nuclear war, economic collapse or some of the various other things, in addition to the poor economic situation of many young people and many many other factors just turned a lot of people off of the idea. \n\nIn my own, humble, experience as a non-virgin (yes boohoo whatever, last time I've had sex was 8 years ago), working on *your own* success and health is infinitely more valuable than getting someone else to stick your dick in them. I'd literally rather have spent my youth working on myself and spending time productively and instead I followed the whims of a toxic person that broke up with me anyways. And what do I get to show for it? Anxiety and depression and a load of other related health issues that I just never had checked out due to said depression. The situation may not have changed much even if she had stuck around, as I still would've invested a significant amount of time that I'd rather have spent on my own life. \n\nThis isn't meant to turn you off, but it's healthier for everyone involved nowadays to just sorta let it happen, or *don't*. Investing significant amounts of time into it is not worth it unless you literally have every other thing in your life in order, and most people don't, because the ruling class isn't letting younger generations get their fair share. \n\nIt was worth it 60 or 100 years ago where your starting salary as a gutter cleaner could support a family of 4 in a townhouse so it was just another step.",

The difference here isn't the patriarchy, but rather higher amounts of the sex selling in media and other trends that tend to cause an oversexualization of culture .",

All I said is that a lot of women will often reinforce toxic masculinity by encouraging men to follow toxic masculine traits and behaviors. Whether that is due to traditional views of gender norms or personal opinion or whatever, it\u2019s a thing that happens and it\u2019s quite common",

This removes their responsibility or at the very least diminishes it greatly. You're treating women as though they are only puppets whose strings are held by toxic masculinity and would be incapable of doing bad if not for the seed of evil that has been placed within them: toxic masculinity.  It's just such a cop out. \n\nAlso I explained why the \"patriarchy\" is not a likely factor in my first comment, but you ignored that I guess. Lots of \"patriarchal\" countries, but only a few of them consider virginity a demerit. Out of all the countries that consider virginity a demerit, there are far more prevalent parallels than the \"patriarchy\" and I gave examples in my first comment.\n\nIdk, I dislike people like you who preach the evils of the \"patriarchy\" while ignoring the fact that it is power that corrupts and not the gender itself. Men hold power in certain situations, but it's not like women don't hold power in just as many other situations. You just miss or willfully ignore the nuance.",

I\u2019m not taking agency away from women, a lot of women realize that mocking men for going against gender norms is wrong. I\u2019m not claiming they aren\u2019t incapable of doing bad, I\u2019m sure a large portion of them may be misled, but another large portion of them are probably just terrible people using easy excuses to be hateful toward men. \n\nYou also seem to be viewing patriarchy as one single type of concept that would be universal. You can have different types of patriarchies that uphold different masculine traits. It\u2019s all sociological and based on what the culture of the area is. If sexuality is heavily repressed though, often in patriarchal societies, men will have a lot more lax rules for sex. The people in power get more freedom to bend the rules. In a matriarchal society, I\u2019m sure women would get that same advantage. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to blame men or absolve women for the affects of a societal patriarchy, but it\u2019s definitely something that needs to be recognized and not pushed aside because it *does* have an impact. You are right that power corrupts and power is the main issue, not men. But in *our* society, men are the people in power, and thus are the ones who can corrupt expectations to match their worldview easier. Men aren\u2019t inherently bad. I wouldn\u2019t even say they have a tendency to be bad. But that doesn\u2019t invalidate the existence of a patriarchy and the effects it has on men and women alike.",

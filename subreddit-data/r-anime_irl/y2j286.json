Add on the fact that almost all organic compounds are flammable in one form or another, and you have a recipe for disaster.\n\nIf you don't aerate it, though, you're mostly good, as long as you get the air out of the fire. No pot/pan lid? Salt in extremely large quantities works fine. (You just have to use enough to disrupt the flow of air to the fuel.)",

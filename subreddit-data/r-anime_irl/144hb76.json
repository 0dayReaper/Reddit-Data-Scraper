Kenta, a practical pitmaster, looks for a grill-friend in Chihiro, an aloof and faultless business babe\u2026or is she? Scared of being rejected for who they really are, the two of them find comfort in food and each other\u2026and all is well until Kenta must transfer away. With their developing relationship at steak, Chihiro proposes they tie the knot and they marry for better or wurst. Winging a long-distance marriage is one thing, but here's the rub\u2014they barely know each other! It's a rare marriage where all the awkwardness of dating meets a sizzling passion for grilling!\n\n\n---\n\n^{anime},&amp;#32;&lt;manga&gt;,&amp;#32;]LN[,&amp;#32;|VN|&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/index)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[/r/](http://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[Edit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/index#wiki_i_made_a_mistake.2C_how_do_i_get_my_comment_reprocessed.3F)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[Mistake?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/submit?selftext=true&amp;title=[ISSUE]&amp;text=/r/anime_irl/comments/144hb76/anime_irl/jnfgu0y/)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[Source](https://github.com/Nihilate/Roboragi)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[Synonyms](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/synonyms)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[\u26d3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/interestinglinks)&amp;#32;|&amp;#32;[\u2665](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roboragi/wiki/thanks)",

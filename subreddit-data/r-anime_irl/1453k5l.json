The screen protector did a good job protecting my lcd in place even though it was pretty busted.\n\nOn the same day, i went to authorized phone repair and replaced the whole lcd and the frame (dammit samsung). After waiting for 3 days, it finished. I bought another tempered glass protector on the same day, so i don't scratch the new screen.\n\nLong story short after \u00b12 weeks repaired, i dropped for the 2nd time. Luckily, only the tempered glass is broken, not the screen. \n\nI was really scared asf when i dropped it for the 2nd time because fixing the goddamn lcd ain't cheap lmao. I held my phone with broken tempered glass for two 2 weeks, and on this day, i replaced that tempered glass.",

Dropped it so many times and not a scratch.\n\nOne day I pulled out my phone and noticed that it was starting to have ghost touches. A few days later the LCD screen and touch sensor completely broke.\n\nThe glass was completely fine though. So I guess \"technically the truth\" advertising.",

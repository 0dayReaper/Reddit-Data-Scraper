But below that, it's more like maximum appeal at a certain proportional size, falling off gradually in *both* directions.    \nSo, in other words, I think a size of *maximum* attractiveness, and any bigger or smaller is progressively less until it hits, and drops below, zero appeal; and everyone's \"preferred size\", along with the rate of dropoff, is going to be different.    \nBut, still, physical aesthetic isn't really a top priority for me.  It's definitely **a** priority, but there are more important things than mere attractiveness; that's just the icing on the cake.  Because, as a wise man once said... \"Make sure she's smart, dont just marry for looks.  There are surgeries and procedures and cosmetics; you change your appearance.  But let me tell you... you can't fix stupid.\"",

I'm not *consciously* going through this process of weighing the value of different features.  That still happens automatically and subconsciously.  What I've done is go back and evaluate that process after the fact and tried picking it apart to see just how it functions.  This is about self-analysis more than anything else.  There are going to be many that don't bother \"thinking about thinking\" so, when their brain just hands them the final answer on the subject, they have no idea just how much background work went into it.      \nThat having been said, different people think in different ways; there's no single \"correct\" way to process our experiences.  Some tend to view things in a more interconnected manner, the \"package deal\" as you put it.  But others, like me, tend to break it up into smaller, more manageable pieces.  This is how I approach **everything,** taking large, hard to address issues and turning it into a matrix of values that I can wrap my head around.  But I only really *understand* that this is what I do because of self-reflection, since it's all handles \"backstage\", so to speak.  And, honestly, there are many people who are doing this very same thing, but don't realize it, and believe they are making wholistic evaluations.    \nLastly, it might be more of a neurodivergent thing.  Neurotypical people are probably better able and tend more towards \"big picture\" and \"don't sweat the details\" ways of thinking.  But for someone like me, with different wiring and a different operating system, that seems strange and bizarre, that a person can just jump straight to their conclusion without going through what are, in my system, necessary processes.",

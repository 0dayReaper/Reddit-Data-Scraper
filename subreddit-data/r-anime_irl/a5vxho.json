They told an elaborate story, created fun interactions and paid respect to a full roster of characters all with wordless cutscenes. They were my favorite part. I think it's such an immense feat, what they did. [Look at this shit. It's a fuckin' masterpiece.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsqET5lkGQE)\n\nWord of Light's more fun... but so few cutscenes... and the few there are, are overwritten, badly voice acted, or have weird layers of text that really don't add anything.

Basically, they were custom fights but you didn't always have the goal of killing everyone. For example, one in Melee prevented you from doing damage by anything besides the pokemon you released from pokeballs, and the only item on the stage was millions of pokeballs. Another Event Match had Yoshi hold an \"egg\" item, and the CPU tried to break the egg by throwing it off stage. The only way to win was to let the timer run out and keep the egg safe.\n\nThese event matches had co-op similar to Subspace (at least in Brawl/Sm4sh).\n\nUltimate's \"Adventure\" mode is really lackluster, just \"kill this one-stock CPU who always has a Super Mushroom.\" There isn't co-op, either.\n\nUltimate also removes things like Homerun contest, trophies, etc., so the only real draw is the rebalancing for competitive play.\n\nSince you haven't played smash 3ds/wii u, though, you'd probably enjoy the fighters themselves a lot more, as the regular fighting is *way* more polished than Brawl/Melee/64.",

The sort of ones that would disappear for days on end, being \"mysterious\" and shit.\n\nSamus however, gives off this vibe that she likes to collect plushies in her ship and just wants to cuddle with someone. She's probably just hella lonely in space, and that kinda makes me sad awhile also wanting to see if her ass could crater my face in if she were to use her jet boots as propulsion to slam her 200 pound Amazonian body onto my delicate frame.",

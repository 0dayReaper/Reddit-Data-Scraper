Basically though the drawers slide out easily because they come out in a straight line from their center of gravity.\n\nHowever when you push them back in if you don't push in the exact right spot or press with equal pressure at multiple points they have a chance to pivot thus jamming one of the back corners into the side of the case. The side of rhe Drawer also gets stuck on the inside corner of the case's opening.\n\nThink about pulling open a board game box how it can slide right out but when you put the lid back on it gets stuck on some sides and you have to wiggle it back and forth to make sure the edges are pulled away from the sides.",

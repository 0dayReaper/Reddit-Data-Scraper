Flying cavalry against a country that only has normal cavalry backed by infantrymen with rifles has some interesting places you can take any theoretical battles, particularly as wyverns being able to land and take off easily would not be comparable to most aircraft other than maybe helicopters though the way they\u2019re depicted usually gives them some agility that most helicopters don\u2019t.\n\nA WW2 army and beyond however will decimate any fantasy army whose units aren\u2019t armored like tanks or has access to particularly creative uses of magic so long as sufficient manpower and firepower is available. Wyverns probably couldn\u2019t go supersonic, and if knights are able to beat dragons then their skin can\u2019t be as tough as a tank. That means that most anti-aircraft guns would likely be effective counterpoints to wyverns. Gen I fighter planes would also be good counterpoints as they would be able to simply outfly the wyverns, though it is plausible that some could be destroyed as the pilots get too close to the wyverns in order to fight then. You start talking about modern anti-aircraft and Gen 3 and 4 fighters, and wyverns don\u2019t stand a chance. Most would die before ever seeing the enemy, unless you beefed them up to the point that literal magic is involved to give non-modern armies and humanity a chance of surviving, which some authors do indeed do.",

The muggles with their science was getting too powerful in large numbers compared to the small amount of wizards..\n\nAlso so nobles and royalty wouldn't force wizards under their command to do shit they didn't want to do, like enslave them to make potions and what not. \n\nOne wizard against 20 men? No problem. 1 wizard vs 5 men with machine guns and bombs? Not as easy.",

Like okay artillery and guys with guns would wipe a Ancient Rome equipped army but some other beast like dragons and minatours should be the thing of nightmares for any infantry unit. Fantasy metal like minthral or orkism should require anti-material weaponry to even scratch and the effects of any magic should have a emp/scrambling effect that makes radios useless and large enough or repeated magic casting could short out electrical equipment. Like casting fireball will drain your phone battery in your pocket but the battery on a armored vehicle will be completely dead by the 20th destructive spell impact\n\nBoth sides have pros and cons. Modern have better logistics while fantasy can be self sufficient given that magic users are present (grow plants/create water). \n\nModern can destroy armies at a distance while fantasy is damn near unbeatable in close quarters. \n\nModern can heal most common illnesses that plague the lands but fantasy can cure cancer, late stage rabies and perfectly resurrect the dead\n\nModern can create lots of cheap consumer goods but fantasy can grant them benefits like the ring of breathing or the cost of resisting cold",

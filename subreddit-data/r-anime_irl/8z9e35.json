They changed up some songs  like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3pb-n59o8s) for the beginning and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iVQmdWBbwo) for the end credits to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCVoKhGgShc) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAyS2yTua0w), respectively. I wouldn't be surprised to hear that they modified or edited out a scene or two, especially since they made Jiji much more talkative in Disney's version, as opposed to Jiji in the original, who had much fewer lines.",

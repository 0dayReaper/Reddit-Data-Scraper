Have you ever had a professor make you buy his book, and if so, how much was it?\n\nI graduated a few years ago, but I am moving toward textbook publishing and am curious as to what your \"on the ground\" experiences are.",

I'm currently working at the bookstore and the most expensive set of books I've sold was for nursing and its about 700. (apparently the set covers a good amount of the classes in the program so I guess that's good)\n",

            "comment": "i dont buy books at the student store. I ask the professor (or students that took the class) if the book is actually needed and if the current edition is needed, then look for the cheapest possible solution on amazon or ebay. Also, i use Google Goggles for Android to scan the barcode of books i need in the cal bookstore to find cheaper books online on the spot. \n\n\nGenerally, I spend less then $200 on books per semester, and usually less. This saves me hundreds of dollars a year. And to save more money, I sell the books online for whatever the lowest price is on amazon. Factoring this in I net about $100 spent on books",

    "postText": "Hey all! I'm currently a high school senior in a local town about 30 minutes from Cal U. My mom went to Cal U for her bsn and online for her msn (nursing). I really want to be a teacher and I already applied to Cal U, just have to give them my transcript. I have taken a tour of campus twice but I thought it'd be cool to ask some students. \n\nA) how much does it cost for you (on campus living)\n\nB) what meal plan do you recommend? (Currently between 14 or 19 new plan)\n\nC) how easy is it for s freshman to get the suite? (I've stayed at the dorms on campus for the annual soccer camp in the summer and a suite dorm seems better to me because they get the initial counter space when you walk in where as a standard 2 person dorm has no counter space)\n\nD) I am in 4 AP classes this year, have taken more in the past. CHS through seton hill and la Roche. Also got a few 3's on some AP tests. Average gpa of 4.4. New SAT score of 1240 (out of 1600) any idea how much, if any money I could get from scholarships?",

I'm sure the suite has a higher price (I stayed in a regular room, smith hall). Add on about 1,400 per semester if you get a meal plan. \n\nB) meal plan advice is tough because it comes down to personal preference. I bought the $1400 middle option when I was a freshman and it worked out alright. My problem was that the gold rush closed too early for dinner (I like to eat late, like 9 or 10) and there weren't many good choices aside from it. \n\nIf you never skip breakfast/lunch/dinner or you have a big appetite or you're just lazy then getting a meal plan is a good look.\n\nHonestly though, if I lived in a suite I wouldn't even get a meal plan and I'd just cook my own food. But that's just me. \n\nC) I'm not sure how competitive it is to secure a suite but I'm pretty sure they're available to freshmen. Start the process early for your best shot at one! That being said, Calu has BY FAR the best regular dorm rooms of any school I've seen including WVU, CSUC, Ohio State, CMU, Duquesne, Carlow, and especially Pitt. Even if you can't get a suite, cal's regular 2 person dorms are a huge upgrade over any other school's. \n\nD) you made a good choice applying early! I applied in September, by October cal offered me a full tuition scholarship (Rutledge economics). I had similar stats: 4.4 GPA, 1920 SAT, handful of AP classes and a bunch of extracurriculars. You should check out their website to see if you meet the requirements for any of their scholarships. \n\nhttp://www.calu.edu/tuition-and-aid/financial-aid/types-of-aid/scholarships/index.htm",

I've timed it. \n\nThere's a bus that you can hop on - for free, with your student ID, also free - that will take you from the bottom of Large Hill (Large Park N Ride) straight to Cal. I live really close to that, so I commute, as it's completely free transit to school every day. \n\nI can't answer any of those questions, and I understand if you just want to stay on-campus anyhow, but it saves me thousands every year! Just thought I'd spread the word!",

    "postText": "So, I've been accepted to Cal, and am working on getting everything ready to begin attending this fall. Just wondering (as this caused a couple of problems when I attended Penn State Fayette and was kinda isolated from everything), how active are most of the clubs on campus? Specifically the gaming, archery, fencing, M:tG...y'know, *those* kinda clubs. Yes, I'm pretty much a nerd.\n\nAlso, is there much to do that's at least within walking distance? I can't really drive yet, so I'm thinking getting out of my room will do me good. I'm hearing good and bad things, and I just wanna know.\n\nThanks for any advice. I doubt I'll get a reply, but can't hurt to try. A year since the last post, though...ouch.\n\nBut anyway, can't wait to get here. :) Sounds like a good campus, and I *have* been there before for a convention, so I've seen it, and it looks nice...but again, anything you wanna tell me, it's welcome.",

We have a movie theater that is always playing something relatively new, though I can't remember how often the movie switches out. There's a game store in town that's certainly in walking distance, I walk there all the time on my way to the Dairy Queen. \n\nOther than that, I haven't personally found anything to do. There are plenty of people always playing Magic in the student center, and I'm sure they play a lot of other things too. I don't personally want to be associated with them, though. I don't even hang out in the student center anymore because of them. We've gotten a new room since the last time I did, but they were so unbearable with the screaming about memes and Magic and MLP that I just couldn't deal. \n\nI'm certain you'll make fast friends with people in your classes, especially if you're a freshman. No one knows anyone, and everyone's trying to make new friends. Will they all be your friend forever? Probably not, but hey, maybe some will. Just talk to people! Trust me, I didn't, and it's the worst. I end up going my entire day without even speaking. Make friends! It's easy!",

Also, what kinda game store is it? Video games, or board/card/tabletop games? And Dairy Queen PLUS the Chick-Fil-A that's supposedly coming...? I'm gonna be 500 pounds. XD\n\nAnd hey, I getcha. I like that kinda stuff...but not if the guys who do it are complete jerks. We'll see, I guess, cause even as a sophomore transferring in, I'm still kinda awkward. \\^\\^' But I'll do my best. Thanks for the info. :)",

I think they match their trade values, but don't quote me on that.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with liking that stuff! I'm all about whatever makes you happy. Honestly, I knew what they were talking about every time - so I'm at least interested enough to know the basics - but the people themselves were just too much for me.\n\nPeople at Cal are really great, though. You'll fit in just fine. Let me know if I can do anything else for you! Feel free to PM, this sub is pretty much dead as dicks.",

Any college experience is going to depend on the effort you put into it. \n\nThat being said, I had plenty of things to do at Cal - from clubs to just hanging out with people in my dorm. I'm still friends with most of those people (Johnson Hall 2002 holler!)\n\n Cal has (had?) a good balance of enough people to find people who like things you do, while giving you chances to meet people you may not normally consider hanging out with. \n\nDo find a core club or group, but don't be afraid to wander into new circles. That's what college is for- challenging who you think you are. \n\nGood luck!",

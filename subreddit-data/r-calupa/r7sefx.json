A friend of mine has been telling me about \u201cweed out classes\u201d which is pretty much the idea that there are specific classes that are meant to weed out students from further their major in order to uphold the reputation of the department. That can\u2019t be real can it?",

I wouldn\u2019t say that it is a \u201cweed out\u201d class but more that\u2019s how Chem is at Cal, it really sucks. That being said I have heard of some upper level classes (in the engineering side of cal) that can be seen as that. But for the most part, no, there are no classes that are actively made to get most people to fail. Do your best but if you do end up not passing talk to your advisor at some point on how to go forward. Good luck!",

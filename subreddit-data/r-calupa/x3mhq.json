We were formed last semester by my roommate and some of our friends, and are now a force to be reckoned with!  Here is our schedule below, we play home games at Philipsburg.  Come support the CFC and watch us beat up on teams from the area....*cough iup cough*\n\nSept. 2- vs. Slippery Rock\nSept. 9- @ Pitt\nSept. 16- vs. Carnegie Mellon\nSept. 23- @ Robert Morris\nSept. 30- vs. West Virginia\nOct. 7- Slippery Rock",

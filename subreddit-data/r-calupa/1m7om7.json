    "postText": "Over the years there have been a rotating group of people playing card games like Magic or computer games, sometimes even watching anime loudly in the commuter center. While I don't mind these activities, I detest the EXTREME boisterousness of these individuals.  They curse, shout, spew inane memes, all around acting inappropriate in the com center.  Commuters like myself need this area to do class work, unwind between classes, maybe eat lunch.  \n\nIf you are these people, or know any of these people, please try to keep the volume and rambunctiousness down.  Be respectful of your peers, and save the energy for the game club or late nights elsewhere. I don't mean to be passive aggressive, I have personally asked this group repeatedly over the years to either keep it down or move on, with no success.  I am tired of sharing the com center with people acting like sugared up children rather than busy college students.",

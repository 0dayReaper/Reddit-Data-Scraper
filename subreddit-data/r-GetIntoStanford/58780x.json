            "comment": "I would've spent even more time building things. Yes, I would've built many more things.\n\nI wish I'd read more books. Biographies, and also books that talk about happiness science and living good lives. (e.g. Happiness Hypothesis, Conscious Living).\n\nI wish I'd read books about being great at communication earlier on and shared them with my family while I lived with them (e.g. The Clearing Model).\n\nThose are the things I could change myself. Things that would require more systemic changes: I wish high school was more focused around learning for the purposes of building things, only. 99.99% of my classes/things I learned in classes were not useful. I also wish a productive communication environment was fostered between students. I was bullied in 7th grade and I have a thought that just being able to talk to the other people 1:1 with good communication skills could have reduced this.\n\nI enjoyed classes because I was good at them and liked competing with the other smart kids, I mostly enjoyed lunches just playing games with friends. But mostly I liked the fact that I didn't do any BS extracurriculars and I just would spend most of my time reading on the internet about things that interested me each day, for a few hours a day.\n\nI only spent ~30 mins a day at peak on homework, and I'm glad about this. If I could change I would do even less. Though it's frustrating that I think if I did less and my grades suffered as a result I might not have gotten into Stanford. It was worth doing the homework to get in, but at the same time it's frustrating, because to me the only benefit of the homework was better grades to get in, and there was no real primary benefit of doing the homework. Whereas if high school was about building things, then there would be a primary benefit to me of getting better at building things and learning things that are truly interesting to me, and if Stanford could just evaluate that, that would be great.",

I'm writing my activities essay about an SAT club I started at school but seeing that the SAT is now almost useless for most of the students at my school, should I keep my essay or write about another topic. I have another activities essay about my job, should I choose that one instead?",

Could be a really interesting angle to the whole \u201clesson(s) I learned from failure\u201d type essay if you word it right. I feel like stanford especially would appreciate an essay like that",

How do I see how many people submit a portfolio, how many people are accepted with one, and how many people are accepted without one?",

I honestly don't think I'll submit one because if anything, I don't want to try too hard to do something that doesn't come naturally and that I don't truly enjoy doing. If anything, it'll probably come across too forced and wouldn't turn out well anyways.",

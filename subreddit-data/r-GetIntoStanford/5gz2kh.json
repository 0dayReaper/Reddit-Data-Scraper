    "postText": "Is there anything that makes students who attend top 20 colleges any different from the rest of the world? After you take out the achievements, test scores, and GPA, what makes them so desirable by colleges. Obviously, you have to stand out in some way and pitch yourself correctly, but how do you know if you're good enough where you'll have a realistic shot (or maybe even a pretty good one)? What if you don't have insane extracurriculars or awards and you just seem \"normal\" and like a human, even on paper? Is there still a possibility?\n\nI constantly try to perfect my application over and over again, but sometimes I can't help to think about all the Elon Musks, Bill Gates, and Mark Zukerbergs out there and how, at least at this given moment in time, Stanford wouldn't have any reason to accept me over them. Can you have seemingly generic ECs and no major awards and still get in based on your unique perspectives and strong ambitions? Do they admit people who seem \"human?\"\n\nI know this has probably already been asked and honestly I don't think I'm asking how to get in right now. I'll be applying regardless, but sometimes I just don't exactly know how to feel about my chances compared to all the people around me who seem all like geniuses who are all super accomplished in their own fields.",

                    "comment": "When you went to Stanford, could you honestly say that absolutely everyone you met was the best at what they did? For example, if someone started their own business, were they all millionares/billionares? Were all the science nerds Intel/Siemens/RSI winners? Were all the writers published and recognized? Were all the athletes olympians and bound to go pro? Were all the computer scientists creating their own apps with millions of downloads or their own computer operating systems?\n\nI mean obviously all accepted applicants have to be smart and have something unique about them, but at a school like Stanford, do you think being \"normal\" might sometimes be the most unique thing of all? I'm not saying that being \"normal\" means getting good grades, just joining clubs in school, and maybe competing in a couple sports for fun. I'm talking about \"normal\" in the sense that these applicants are genuinely pursuing what deeply interests them and maybe it's not something that you can put a quantifiable value on. People who are creating value in the world, but it's just not seen in the spotlight. Maybe they see that their elderly neighbor is struggling to use the internet and they spend a couple hours a week helping them learn. Maybe they see an opportunity to put their writing skills to good use and write for a video gaming company. Maybe they see that someone in their family is struggling with an eating disorder and they go out to create a cookbook of delicious foods to help him/her and distribute it to others who have similar problems?\n\nDo you sort of get what I'm saying? Maybe I was exaggerating when I was saying \"normal.\" When I meant \"normal,\" I was referring to the people who are creating value in the world, just not the value people often associate with college applications. It might not be ground-breaking research or being recognized nationally, but it just makes it seem all so much more genuine if you're doing it without any materialistic reward right?",

                            "comment": "6 people got into Stanford from my school in the last 3 years. I knew 3 of them (impersonally but through other ppl). At least from my school, most people who got in had amazing grades and impressive ECs that showed leadership and stuff but most didn't actually have an overarching passion where they were world-class. Nobody did any of the things you mentioned above, or of that caliber. However, they had other things. eg: one student was double legacy, one student was URM, another student had some of the best stats in the entire world (got 52/45 on IB which only like 2-3 people get in the whole world), and some people were extremely interesting and wrote really good essays that showed that (eg. one talked about his adventures with cooking even though he had few ECs or achievements to show for that) or brought a unique perspective to campus/overcame hardship (there are a few people who attend my school on scholarship from LEDCs). \n\nPersonally, I was surprised to find this. But, I feel, being world-class at something isn't the only way to get into Stanford. There are definitely \"ordinary\" people at Stanford in terms of achievements, but each of them obviously stood out to the admissions office in some way. Here, watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T4cjJYbIng\n\nIt doesn't help your chances of course. Perhaps it's just how international schools work though. It's hard for people to get massive achievements here and competitions because they can't represent the country they're in. (I'm an expat in Singapore). I would say in the US that's less true.\n\n**The moderator of this sub would obviously have a proper/real picture.**",

For each of them their main EC/component of their profile was iOS app development. And none of them had \"millions of downloads\" as you put it\u2014actually millions of downloads is a lot. Some had thousands and others had more, but not by that much. Some people had recognition in other areas though. Also none of them actually had a \"business\" from their app/raised any $$$. Actually, the most one person had was 90k downloads but at the same time the app was relatively simple. I will say, however, each of them had recognition from Apple in some way (that's how I know them).\n\nAlso, I'd imagine that very few people attending Stanford who did things like start a business in HS are self-made millionaires. I think that's rarer than you would think. \n\nThat's just my personal experience w/ my friends &amp; people I know attending Stanford.",

Then I saw that people could download \"Xcode\" and create an app - didn't think it would be possible for just about anybody to start getting their own Apps on the App Store.\n\nSo I started watching tutorials, reading books, and building stuff. Built many apps, maybe 30 (for learning, only shipped a few), each time the project increased in scope. Contra took 2 years to develop because I had to expand my horizons by a lot.\n\nIf you are interested in starting iOS development then email me\n\nme@rohankapur.com\n\nOr add me on FB: Rohan Kapur\n\nOh and I can't remember how I came up with ideas for most projects. Usually just asked people what would be cool or thought to myself. For contra I just wanted to create a social platform but I slowly figured out my vision for it throughout the years ",

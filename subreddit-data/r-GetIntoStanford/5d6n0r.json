It's not something I do often but all of the other Stanford prompts already cover my more interested/invested passions. \n\nThe reason I ask is because I'm not sure if I want to include it on my activities list. \n\nThanks ",

I've just applied to Stanford REA and the way I got around that self reporting money issue is by having my extra recommendation written by one of the people who mentored me through my sale and interactions with Silicon Valley.\nThis recommendation reported a general idea of the monetary sum.\nIt might come across as better (humble) if someone else reports it, and it seems more truthful?  Idk.  Just though that might help OP :).",

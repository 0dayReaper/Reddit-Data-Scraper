    "postText": "I know this isn't necessarily the main subject of this subreddit but I don't know of anywhere else to post this.  I've made over $1500 in my sophomore year but I made that in a way that doesn't scale very well.  I'm willing to use most of this as my seed money.  I believe I have the skills to back my ambition up but I'm pretty lost in terms of ideas.  My skills (attained most of these in the past summer):\n\n* Front-end Dev (Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, etc)\n* Back-end Dev (Node.js, express.js, etc)\n* App dev - Ionic\n* Writing - I did some article writing in the past for a few blogs\n* Business?  (idk if this counts but I've done some case study competitions)\n\nIn theory I think I should know what to do, but in reality I'm clueless.  To anyone who's started a profitable business or made money some other way in high school, what did you do?  \n\n",

And then you'll always have an income source you can scale up and down as needed.",

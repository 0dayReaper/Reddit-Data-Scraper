Screen &amp; Sort \u2013 organizing the apps and sending to the appropriate admissions officer\n2. Individual Reads \u2013 one, two, three, or more individual reads to form initial impressions\n3. Committee \u2013 deliberation of applications among a group\n4. Final Decision \u2013 the lucky few are selected, financial aid packages are created, and acceptance letters are mailed out\n\nSee here for more info: https://prepmaven.com/blog/applying/how-colleges-read-your-application-a-4-step-process/",

They'll be helpful. You could just email \"Hello, If I've already sent my ACT scores to Stanford should I still self report them on the Common App? [newline] Thanks, [Name]\"\n\nI'd also include the homeschooling question in the email, as such: \"I was homeschooled in the ninth grade. Where is the best place for me to note this information on my application?\"\n\nThat said, I'm pretty sure Stanford doesn't look at 9th grade scores, so I doubt it'll matter much.\n\nGood luck!",

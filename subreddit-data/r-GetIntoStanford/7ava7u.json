    "postText": "Hey y'all, I was wondering how my list of ECs would come across to the admissions officers over at Stanford. I've asked this in a separate form in the chanceme thread, but since this is specifically Stanford-oriented, I figure there's more knowledge and insight here about how Stanford views and evaluates applicants. Here's my list:\n\n1. Founded a project that sent 40,000 meals to impoverished children overseas and $2000 for local veterans (4 years)\n2. Strategy Director at a youth-run organization furthering education in Africa, building a dozen classrooms (2 years)\n3. Business Director and Top Fifer at a fife-and-drum corp that volunteers at local fundraising events, 400+ hours of performance time (7 years)\n4. App Developer and Publicist for a district-implemented tutoring program that connects students to peer tutors (2 years)\n5. Two-time global finalist at a theatrical and engineering-based tournament that shall go unnamed, now Board Member at a regional section of the tournament, organizing tournament for over 140+ teams (6 years)\n6. Student School Board member advocating (1 year)\n7. Debate Captain at school club, National Qualifier (3 years)\n8. Co-President of FBLA chapter, National Qualifier for one event and State finalist for the second (3 years)\n9. Writer for a youth policy think tank, invited to present at a Congressional meeting (2 years)\n10. Internship at a successful Congressional Campaign, going door-to-door advocating for the candidate (2 years)\n\nI hope this is a pertinent-enough thread. If not, I apologize.\n\nThank you for taking a read, I super appreciate it :)",

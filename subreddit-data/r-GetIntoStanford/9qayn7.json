    "postText": "After a very rough senior year and economic and family crisis, I decided to go to community college. But now I'm not sure if I will be able to have a chance at transferring. (Also I AM VERY AWARE of how low transfer admission is). I think I have a interesting life story but because of how Im still feeling sort of depressed from my current life situation I am struggling in one of my classes under a B. I've heard how almost anything below a 4.0 GPA can almost ruin my application. I want some advice on what I should do or advice in general on this issue.\n\nAlso I would really appreciate if anyone who has transferred successfully could help since us transfer applicants are in the dark.",

I like Instapaper more than Pocket for the highlighting function. \n\n* Freedom - iPhone and Mac App to block the internet, so you can get work done. Can block only certain websites too. Stayfocusd - Chrome Extension to block sites. WasteNoTime - Safari extension to block sites. \n\n* Spotify playlists - Check out \"Beats to think to\" and \"Deep Focus.\" Good music to keep you on task. \n\n",

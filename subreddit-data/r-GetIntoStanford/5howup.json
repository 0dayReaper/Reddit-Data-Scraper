    "postText": "From what I've seen, most of this subreddit and most of the people that I know who get into Stanford are the computer science/tech entrepreneurship type applicants. Most of the advice on the How to Get Into Stanford guide was focused around this type of applicant as well.\n\nI'm a bit different. While I'm interested in entrepreneurship, most of my accomplishments in high school are centered around debate (Tournament of Champions, etc) and politics (Boys State senate, etc). \n\nAny advice on how I should approach my Stanford application and build a narrative? Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Just wanted to let you know that there are many ways to express entrepreneurship. For example my friend who got into Stanford talked about cooking/culinary adventures and creating meals and how he brings together different disciplines to do it. Another person wrote about how she loves making her own clothes, also using multiple disciplines. Stanford aims to create a diverse class like any other school and they definitely don't just want tech kids, but they want students who will be good matches with their school. They of course need to fill their niches eg in your case debaters. Think the moderator would have good advice for how to build your narrative.",

I guess I might still call someone like that having an entrepreneurial spirit but not sure could be wrong. Stanford values initiative, creativity, leadership, intellectual vitality, independence, etc. Entrepreneurship is like a culmination of these things.\n\nPursuing your passion in itself is also very entrepreneurial in that same sense.",

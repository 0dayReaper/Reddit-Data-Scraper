    "postText": "Hey everyone,\nI'm new to this forum, a junior in high school, and I really want to get into Stanford. I'm looking for some help, mainly advice on what I should do based on my current academic achievements, etc, and what I should work on.\n1st, I'm not really exceptional exceptional in any way as in a way to get into Stanford. I keep hearing about how you have to do something really \"special\" to get in, and I havent done anything like that really.\n2nd, I'm homeschooled.\nIn my 10th grade I took the PSAT and got a 1450, not sure how things will roll this year.\nI only have 4 APs taken total, 2 5's and 2 4's, will be taking around 4 or 5 more in my junior year this year.\nI'm aiming for an SAT score of 1550, not sure if thats achievable given my academic intellectual ability.\nAlmost all my classes are honors or APs, so technically I have a weighted GPA of 4.8 approximately, but not sure if Stanford will notice that since I'm homeschooled.\nI have an 800 in Physics 1 and 800 in Math 2.\nI dont do very well in competitions,.\nI dont do many extracirriculars, Im pretty good with Physical Ed (weightlifting and cardio), good at basketball.\nThe majors I'm interested in are Business, Math, and Physics.\nThe one thing that is cool is that I got 7th place in North America playing Clash Royale in the CCGS Spring 2017 tournament. I won $3000 through that, will that help me at all?\nIve earned around $2000 through tutoring and my own basketball class, and I work at Chik Fil A around 12 hours a week.\nSo thats basically it. Nothing special or glamorous (besides my inflated GPA lol), should I work on anything in particular or try to work on my passion and build a business or something like that?\nThanks Joseph",

    "postText": "To begin with, my high school transcript was not the prettiest and my SAT scores are sub-par to the standards of Stanford. I am planning to study up for the ACT, and do insanely well my first two semesters here at the four year university. I know the chances of just being accepted as a Stanford applicant itself is already so low, and that my past academic marks doesnt make it any better, but rather than my chances, it would be greatly appreciated if someone can lead me into the direction I should be taking. \n\nFirst predicament: I am wondering what type of courses would deem \"competitive\" to Stanford admissions. I am currently an economics major, with no math course and some business courses.  But I am planning to take Calc 1 at another CC during the fall semester, then take Calc 2 at another college during the winter break courses, then finally take Calc 3 during my spring semester. Would this be counter-productive? What would get the interest of admissions in these regards. Should I work on getting other courses? \n\nSecond and final predicament: \nAs mentioned before, my standardized test scores are just not on-par with Stanford's standards. Should I be using my resources and time to get a better ACT score? \n\nThank you for hearing me out! Any constructive criticism about my plan, any additions to it, just any advice would be greatly appreciated. Once again, rather than telling me the extremely low chances of me getting in, any insight in how to approach my current situation would be great. Thank you!",

You'd need to do extremely impressive things to get in as a transfer - identify what you could be best at in the entire world i.e. https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-get-over-the-fact-that-you-will-never-be-the-best-at-anything/answer/Auren-Hoffman?srid=p42X and then do it and make it obvious\n\nUnless you're insanely impressive in some way you won't get in as a transfer even with perfect grades\n\n&gt; Should I be using my resources and time to get a better ACT score?\n\nwhat's your score?",

Here's the idea that I had:\n\n1. Message people on Twitter who frequently post things that appeal to high ambition people. Usually, the content of their tweets is similar to the content of your links. In fact, I noticed that some of your links went to specific Tweets, so you shouldn't have a hard time finding people.\n2. Explain what you're doing and say that they might be interested in gaining small tidbits of inspiration/wisdom about startups, life, etc. that they could tweet about in the future. Emphasize that your newsletter is meant to supplement other sources of \"tidbit\" information (such as their own Twitter feeds) with pieces that won't immediately be found on Twitter, such as direct blog posts, interesting Quora answers, book summaries, and more.\n3. If they like it, you can ask for them to tweet about it and reach your intended audience (and effectively add their audience to yours).\n\nThe benefit of this is that people who follow these Twitter \"people...?\" already take in the high ambition bites of info, and a daily newsletter will just add to the information flow. Sharing it this way will also seem more trustworthy/worthwhile than a random Reddit post. But, one challenge that I could see occurring is the Twitter folk ignoring your requests, since a lot of them are busy with their own startups and personal lives.\n\nNot sure if you've thought of this and deemed it unrealistic; this was just my first instinct!",

On the note of discovery, I also love that some of your links lead to longer posts similar to those of this sub. It felt like stumbling on a gold mine when I found this sub and u/129183-stan-ps's blog. Having a newsletter continue deliver me gold is just amazing! I also think it'd be neat if you included some book recommendations occasionally. Regardless, I say keep it up! I'm really enjoying it.",

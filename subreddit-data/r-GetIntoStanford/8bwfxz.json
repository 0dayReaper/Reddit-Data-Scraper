    "postText": "Hello! Presently I'm a sophomore in high school and was wondering what I could do to get into Stanford. I have good grades, take many APs, and generally do well in school but I feel like I need some big thing to make me stand out compared to my competition. Right now the only big things I have is that I volunteered my spring breaks these last two years building parks for the Yurok Indian Reservation with my local Rotary Club. I also happened to be admitted into the John Hopkins Center of Talented Youth. I feel like I need some other extracurricular activities or classes that can help my get admitted to Stanford. Any suggestions?\nSo far I plan to take an internship at a biotech company nearby based on my school's biotech course and I also plan to continue assisting my Rotary Club.",

    "postText": "I am a junior in high school. Stanford has been my dream school for the past 2 years, but I\u2019m finding myself becoming less motivated in my chances of getting in. You see, I\u2019ve only taken one AP class (AP LANG) so far, and will take another one (AP LIT) in my senior year. How good or bad will this affect my chances of getting in? How can increase my chances of getting in?\n\nI know that Stanford is a very elite and selective school, and I just want to meet their standards.",

Your ECs aren\u2019t great but I\u2019ve seen people get in that have no ECs and some with the best ECs get rejected. Some good essays can get you in anywhere",

No clubs, awards, classes etc. will make the difference because they're all so commonplace and doesn't disintiguish you enough from any other applicant. The things that will really set you apart are the things you do yourself outside school - personal projects, work experience, internships, prestigious competitions (ISEF, Google science fair, Olympiads etc.), companies you started etc. If you don't have anything like this that will make you unique and stand out from other applicants (who all have a 4.0, who are all president of key club, who all take 20 APs, who are all National merit finalist.. You get the point), then your chances of being admitted a slim to none.",

I was thinking about a blog, and I will keep brainstorming ideas. I guess colleges, not only Stanford, are really drawn to how you can make an impact in the world. Do you think that it is too late for me to start something of my own, since it is almost the summer after my junior year? I want to at least try, even if I have slim to no chance of getting in.",

It's not too late, but you will have to work very hard. Try to find things that aren't just busy work, but actually intellectually invigorating and impactful to the world at large.",

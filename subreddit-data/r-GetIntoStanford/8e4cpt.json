    "postText": "I've followed the 'underscheduled' life style discussed in Newport's book How to Be a Highschool Superstar and have pursued many unusual interests deeply that I love in my spare free time (which I have an abundant amount of due to staying at home taking care of siblings often). But there comes a day when I don't do any of those activities, and then it becomes a habit of staying in bed all day after doing homework and browsing reddit and watching Youtube, and not pursuing the things I like, hence, I never really do commit to an activity for more than a few months or a year or so. \n\n\nFor instance, I was really into learning cybersecurity and ethical hacking, and with my love for teaching and public speaking, I started a club where I could teach others how to use Linux and compete in CTF competitions. However, after a few weeks my drive and motivation for it drove out and I just stagnated and stayed at home often and not do a lick of programming or bug hunting. Just watch motivational Youtube videos and do nothing.\n\n\nOr when I was super interested in Japanese culture, and so I took a lot of MOOC courses on Japanese culture and technology, bought the Genki textbook to teach myself Japanese, signed up for the Japan tour this summer, and even started a Kendo club (Japanese fencing) where my friends and I get together to learn about swordfighting and Japanese traditions and mannerisms. I still do teach the Kendo club every friday, however, my other pursuits of taking online courses and learning the language has died out, and whenever I get home I rarely do homework and just lay in bed watching Youtube and scroll on Reddit. \n\n\nI'm having trouble staying commited to the things I love due to utter laziness. And I know I should probably put myself in a more different and stimulating environment instead of home, however, I have to always stay home and take care of my brother when I'm not doing school activities, and my school activities are short (chess club, kendo, and hack club this year only). And also help out my parents at their salon on the weekends. So when I'm not doing interesting things I like, I help my family out in general. \n\n\nHow to combat this laziness and stay commited to my ECs and activities in my free time? ",

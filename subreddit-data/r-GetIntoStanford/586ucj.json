            "comment": "&gt; Can having really solid ECs make colleges \"look past\" a lower GPA?\n\nDepends how solid the ECs are and how low the GPA is. I think a HS student who had made millions of dollars on their own or won a Nobel Prize or done something insane could probably get in with a terrible GPA (even close to a 2.0) assuming they had high test scores, say for ACT 32/33+\n\n&gt; I realize my GPA is low, but how good do you think my chance is? \n\nDepending on how significant the research, company, and app you developed are. \nIf they aren't that significant, then chances aren't great but not zero. If they are significant, then chances are good. \n\nSignificant would be showing how much value your research added to the scientific community or people who benefited from the research. Significance for the company would be showing how much money you have made, and how much your customers love the product and how it makes their lives and the world better. Significance for the app would be the same as the company.",

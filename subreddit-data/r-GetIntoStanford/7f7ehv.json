I'm currently in the hospital because I'm no longer in remission for my tumor, and I've had heart failure. I'm currently waiting to have several surgeries, at the moment. My admission to the hospital will not end before the December 2nd ACT. So, will not having SAT 2's screw me over for admission to Stanford?",

I can't speak for the admissions office, but they won't hold something like that against you, especially since you've been dealing with such a serious illness.\n\nu/sup6978 probably has more to say on this topic.\n\nI sincerely hope that your surgeries go well! Sending all my positive energy :) ",

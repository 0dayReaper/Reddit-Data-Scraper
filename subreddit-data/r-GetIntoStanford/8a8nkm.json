    "postText": "I, like all other applicants, was an outstanding student: perfect GPA, good test scores, amazing ECs and essays, rare and selective academic awards plus some national-level sports awards. Unfortunately, Stanford take 0-1 students from my country a year (or something low like that lol). Stanford never accepted anyone from my school, except for this year... they accepted this amazing girl who just had to apply this year haha - and there went my 'spot', if I had a chance to begin with. I got accepted into Yale, Princeton, Cal, UCLA, UCSD (only applied to 7 schools) and the Stanford essays were by far my best ones so I know I must've had some sort of a chance and I still dream of going to Stanford. What should I do to go to Stanford? Is it still possible for me to be part of the class of 2022? - whether it be through appeal or as a transfer student. If not, is a gap year a wise idea?\n\nIs there a chance for me to appeal my decision with Stanford in general? There are many things I had to leave unsaid that I know might change my decision if it's possible for Stanford to reconsider.",

I don't see why it would be impossible, though I imagine ridiculously unlikely\n\nI think gap years are generally excellent ideas.\n\nSee also the two articles I linked in another comment to validate your assumption that stanford is really the option you want most. (You could frame the decision as 'what do i want to do from ~september 2018 to ~june 2019, and those options could include stanford, all the schools you got into, and a gap year, and then see which one wins.",

I wouldn't do a gap year if its just to potentially increase your chances of getting into Stanford.\n\nI would suggest attending one of the schools you were accepted to. Maybe after a year of being at the school, you will actually love it. If not, then you can transfer. I think that's the best course of action.\n\nIf you have a chance, you can also visit the schools to help you make a decision of which one you should attend. If you want my opinion on the schools you were accepted to, Im a fan of Princeton. I visited the campus and they have great academics there. Really beautiful place, environment and academic environment.",

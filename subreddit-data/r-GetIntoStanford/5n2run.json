    "postText": "I want to major in Computer Science at Stanford. I think I have a chance of getting into the school, but I'm afraid that it is one of the most popular majors you can take at Stanford. Would it help my chances if I applied for a less popular major/department and then transfer my major over to CS once I'm already accepted?",

    "postText": "I\u2019m wondering how important it is to form a coherent narrative in one\u2019s application and how to do so. In my case, my extracurriculars consist of: -founding and leading a tutoring nonprofit program with over 20 members - science bowl cocaptain - participate in science Olympiad and math club (won some awards) - a lot of art (been in exhibitions and won awards) - graphic design job - job as a teachers assistant for a summer computer class  - recreational programming  - took a few online coding classes - chess club. I am not sure how I will pull this all together into a compelling narrative. It seems like I am too well-rounded. I was thinking maybe I can talk about my analytical and creative sides and the connections between science and art. Any ideas or advice?",

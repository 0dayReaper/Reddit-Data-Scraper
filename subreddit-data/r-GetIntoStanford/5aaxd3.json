With standardized testing and even grades, there comes a certain point (a threshold/bar, if you will) where Stanford instead focuses on: \n\n- Passion/commitment of the student\n- Intellect of the student\n- Personality/qualities of the student\n- Fit for the school\n\nThis is all done through activities section, essays, letter of recommendation, etc.\n\nThey're asking: how likely they are to be extremely successful/change the world and give Stanford a better name? SATs/grades *alone* are not the best indicator of that.\n\nAre you international? Usually some international students will not realize this\u2014at least where I'm from (Australia) the system is solely based on academics.",

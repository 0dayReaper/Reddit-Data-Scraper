    "postText": "I'm a Canadian BSc. Biology holder with some pretty broad academic accolades, scavenged courses from a few different disciplines and even nabbed a thesis in a completely different field of Computational Chemistry. As an extra curricular skillset, I've developed my camera work and editing abilities to a new level. In fact I enhanced my skills with a volunteer organization during University and now just launched my own company to better the public's knowledge of science through video (vibrant colors and music included). \n\nHas anybody been accepted to this program, or even aware of this program? If so, a helping hand would go a longggg way. Thank you, people.",

I think a well-written email to 2-3 of the students here would enable you to Skype with some of them, if you wanted:\n\nhttp://designimpact.stanford.edu/about/students/\n\ne.g.\n\n\"Hi [Name],\n\nMy name is [x]. I'm [a few words about you].\n\nI'd really like to hear your thoughts on the Design Impact program you're in, and hear a bit about your experience as an applicant.\n\nWould you be available for a phone call this week?\n\nThanks,\n[name]\"\n\nIf you do that, please report back with the results.",

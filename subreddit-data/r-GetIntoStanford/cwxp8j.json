    "postText": "does anyone have any tips on deciding whether or not to go REA? my advisor says it might be more difficult since they pick the cream of the crop from that bunch but i'm scared that if i didn't show enough commitment to the school by applying RD it might hurt me. im a senior w 35 act, 5 on APUSH, calc AB, APWH, 4 on APbio and lang, 3 on french. president of french honor society and women's rights club, treasurer of NHS. played piano for 10 years and received CM Advanced level. i wanna apply as a biochem major.

My friends who chose not to apply to their dream schools early regretted it because they always wondered if they would've gotten in.\n\nThat's just my advice, go with your gut feeling! Good luck!",

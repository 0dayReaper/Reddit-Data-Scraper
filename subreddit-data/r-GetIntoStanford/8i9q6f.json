Yes - have been an investor at a top VC firm (where top firms = accel, a16z, benchmark, founders fund, greylock, sequoia), have been an investor with my own small fund, and have small businesses I own that pay the bills without me needing to actively work on them. Have always been thinking about impact, now actively and slowly beginning to shift my time allocation towards impact. I like thinking about how to do crazy big things...\n\nThis probably sounds better than it is - so I'd like to borrow a disclaimer I once read, which is that I'm not an expert at anything, advice isn't one size fits all, I will not be correct on everything, and you should compare things I say with what you know, what you do, and what others suggest.

                    "comment": "Short answer is: the same way you raise VC/angel money as a non-teen.\n\nExpanded with some notes\n\n- Fundraising is hard and generally it should be hard.\n- The best leverage point is making someone predisposed to want to invest, before they meet you. You can do this in various ways, e.g. extremely strong fit to their theses, extremely strong fit to either their early wins or their early big misses/regrets, extremely strong introductions from credible people, strong external traction and/or customer love that is highly visible, etc.\n- See this summary of the book Pitch Anything. The power dynamic it talks about definitely applies to fundraising. https://web.archive.org/web/20161021175515/http://www.lovebusinessbooks.com:80/2013/10/pitch-anything-an-innovative-method-for-presenting-persuading-and-winning-the-deal-by-oren-klaff/\n- Raising from angel investors is decently different to raising from VCs. Make sure to know the pros and cons of which types of investors you're seeking, and make sure to pick the right type of investors for your fundraise.\n- The money isn't raised until it hits the bank.\n- Run a process! You should compress as much funder energy as possible into as small amount of time as possible. You should refuse to take fundraising meetings until you're ready/able to do them *all.* e.g. if first person asks to meet you, put them off until you've got multiple people ready to meet with really strong introductions, so that you can set up all those meetings around the same time.\n\nThe hardest part of fundraising is being a founder worth investing in (if pre-seed/seed/perhaps Series A) and/or building a business worth investing in. The second hardest part is probably managing and optimizing the power dynamic and running a tight process. Fundraising is a sales process. Being a great salesperson is hard. \n\nMy suggestion would be to firstly invest all of your energy into being a founder worth backing and creating a business worth backing. Then once you've done that, leverage the fact that you're a person worth backing to find founders who have done a great job at similar fundraises to yours who are now ~12-18 months ahead of where you are but in a similar enough type of business, and then assemble a group of perhaps ~5 of these founders to give you fundraising help and to walk you through the process. The rationale for this is that there's so much nuance, but it's not worth really trying to learn all this info ahead of time, it's better focusing on building a great business, and then instead of needing to go and learn all this info on how to be amazing at fundraising yourself, instead find these ~3-5 people who have done an excellent job at fundraising in a similar situation to yours - basically, find the experts, save yourself the time and go to the \"source\" - the people who have a ton of this knowledge in their head (which is somewhat vital because many of the situations that will come up in your fundraise will feel somewhat specific and so you'll much prefer being able to get specific answers to your specific situational questions). And, it's much easier to find people who are willing to give you free advice and help (people love helping especially when the only thing you want from them is their advice/help, it makes them feel valued/significant/important) than it is to find your first few investors and get them to wire money.",

And watch a bunch of the videos from YC's investor school https://investor.startupschool.org/.\n\nAll of the above advice if focused on raising for startups optimized for growth (say companies that could plausibly achieve $1b/year positive free cash flow within 15 years post-founding), though some of it will apply to other kinds of fund raising too (e.g. raising a venture/angel fund, raising for a cash flow business, etc).",

I have a decent amount of robotics/cs experience from all the side projects and clubs and activities I've participated in as a high-school student. But as I move into college, I figure that I should stick with one field-software or robotics(I'm talking about the computer science side of things that doesn't overlap with robotics) Ultimately, my goals are to do something impactful and create things of value for as many people as I can and I find both of these fields to be fun. Do you have any advice on how to choose between areas of study to focus on for the future and what I should keep in mind when I'm looking for problem areas or solving problems? (p.s. Thanks so much for taking your time to help us out!)",

                    "comment": "Yes - great question. I think a good heuristic is to evaluate which of those areas you believe you can be better at ~15 years from now. I believe that the best returns come from being able to get compound interest, and that is true here also. Try and look at the people who are world class in these various fields, and look at the attributes, values and skill required to be world class in the areas, and then evaluate which of those attributes/values/skills it seems like you'll be able to be best at ~15 years from now (don't evaluate based on yourself today, instead try and look at what you'll be able to be best at in the long-term).\n\nIn general both of those seem like great fields that will have lots of good opportunities. There are massively increasing returns as you go towards the very top of a field, e.g. the top 0.1% as opposed to the top 10%, so you want to pick whichever one you might be able to be much better at, skill wise, ~15 years from now. And the way to do that is to look at the people in the top of the field, and assess your underlying attributes to evaluate where you think your trajectory can get you.\n\nAs a side note: I think this advice from Scott Adams is excellent, http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html, where the tl;dr is it's often really useful to frame your desired skill/field as the intersection of two things, rather than one thing. e.g. it might be computer scientists + leadership, or computer science + capital allocation, or robotics + user experience design, or robotics + factory operations, etc.",

Then you're free to quit and start your own company. Even if you don't get selected in the H1B lottery, they'd \"park\" you in an overseas office and could transfer you to the US via the L1 visa, then sponsor you for a green card later on. What sucks about this method is that it takes a long time (years), so it's not that attractive for entrepreneurs. It's better than being sent back to your country though.\n\nI don't think the Trump administration would revoke this visa though. It would create jobs, seriously boost the economy, and it's unlikely to be abused like the H1B is. Let's pray lol",

I heard the H1B is much easier for Australians than Europeans for example.\n\nMy European friend has been working on the J-1 traineeship in the Bay Area (which he can just renew every 1.5 years but it's not upgradeable to a green card) and is in the process of doing the O-1. O-1 is basically a visa for very very talented people and it isn't bound to a particular job like the J-1 is.\n\nIn any case this visa is not very relevant if you dislike the H1B. I think H1B isn't for startups; it's for full time positions. ",

This visa would let you skip all of that :)",

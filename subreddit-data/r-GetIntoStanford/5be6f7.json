Stanford is (somewhat surprisingly) massively constrained by building/land space. i.e. they need more spaces for students to live.\n\n- Not enough talent. I doubt that there aren't 1000 more students that would fit Stanford's standards. Now, whether they are the correct standards is another question entirely, but I believe there aren't a large number more people that fit what Stanford wants.",

We have to make tough decisions.\"\n\nIf they had more seats, it would be easier.",

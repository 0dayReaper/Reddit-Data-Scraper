    "postText": "Hello all!\n\nI have a question regarding junior year grades and a (slight) downward trend. Freshman and Sophomore year I earned straight A's in a rigorous international school. Junior year, however, I moved to the US and while the coursework wasn't harder (AP and IB courses), my performance decreased a bit because I was diagnosed with a tumor. I had the chance to rectify these grades over the summer (I have an agreement with one of the teachers), but I was too ill to go. I had 2 B's per semester (3 of which were B+'s). \n\nWill Stanford frown upon this slight drop in grades?",

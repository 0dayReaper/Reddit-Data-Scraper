    "postText": "I'm currently deciding between Stanford or Upenn for ED, and I'm not sure which I prefer yet. (I like how you can go into Stanford undecided while at Upenn you have to commit to business (because I'm applying to Wharton)).\n\nI think I might have a better chance at Upenn Wharton, but I think I might like Stanford better since it (i think) values the arts more? (And the location aaaah).\n\nI have a 1500 super scored SAT right now (710 eng, 790 math), and a 780 math 2 subject sat.\n\n(PS should i bother taking chem sat2 in october?)\n\nMy ecs/awards: school president of 2100 person school, student trustee of my city, city ultimate frisbee team captain, enrolled in specialized high school art program, DECA trainer, DECA international top 10 award, frisbee team 14th place nationally, run art therapy workshops at retirement home\n\nLet me know what you think! thank you guys very much :-))",

            "comment": "In the exact same position- I prefer Stanford but don\u2019t know whether to apply early to Penn. The big difference between Penn and Stanford is that Penn has ED vs Stanford\u2019s REA. A lot of athletes and legacies are accepted in Stanford\u2019s REA admission time, and some people even say to apply regular if you are a \u201cregular\u201d candidate (not an athlete or legacy) to Stanford. If you\u2019re fine with going to Penn and wouldn\u2019t regret not getting to go to Stanford if you made it in to Penn, definitely go for ED with Penn. Unlike Stanford, the chances of being accepted drastically go up when applying early decision to Penn.",

Take it with a grain of salt though as I can\u2019t 100% verify it.",

            "comment": "Looking at the sheer amount of scientific evidence concerning the subject, I don't think your proposed sleep plan (staying up for ~20 hrs straight) would be generally sustainable. Sure, there are certain people that can get by with less sleep, but this random attribute is not limited to \"geniuses\". For the average person, keeping this sleep schedule will likely lessen productivity in the short term and cause extreme health problems in the long term.\n\nHowever, there seems to be a solution to your problem. Polyphasic sleep cycles might be an option, and from my (limited) knowledge, they have no extreme side effects. Da Vinci, for one, took a 20 min nap every 4 hours, giving him about 2hrs of sleep per day. Other high achievers have also adopted this cycle, but google will be able to tell you more than I can.\n\nAs you likely have realized by now, one downside of periodic sleep is that it doesn't quite fit with a regular school and/or work schedule. Although, if you do plan on working for yourself/creating a startup/etc, this type of cycle may offer some distinct advantages, especially in terms of how much work you're able to cram into one day.\n\nAs I said, I don't have much experience with polyphasic cycles, but I would probably not recommend it to a (still developing) teenager. Check out /r/polyphasic for some more info.",

For some reason I feel really drowsy, less focused and overall less productive whenever I sleep for more than 8 hours. If you want to sleep for only 4 hours then go ahead but if you feel sleepy or have any other symptoms of being tired than I would suggest that you increase you sleeping time by 30 min increments until you feel comfortable.",

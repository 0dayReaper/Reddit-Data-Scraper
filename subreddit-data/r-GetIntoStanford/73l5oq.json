    "postText": "To give a short bio about my circumstance, I was born in Israel and moved to the US when I was 11. Never cared much for school as I had pretty crappy home life and was under the impression I'd be joining the Israeli military as soon as I finished high school.\n\n My parents ended up convincing me to stay in the US until I got my citizenship and go to college for engineering in the meantime. I ended up dropping out of school several times and when I finally got my citizenship, the Israeli military did not want me. So I joined the marine corps as an infantryman. \n\nI know I'm capable I've scored 32 on my ACT without practice and for my classes I always did well in tests just never did much of anything else. I volunteer at my nearby animal shelter and with my military experience I decided I want to become a biomedical engineer and focus on prosthetics for veterans.\n\n I've become extremely passionate about the subject and am interested in going to community college and hopefully transferring to Stanford after proving my educational drive in school. I'm currently deployed to Iraq and when I get back I'm planning on starting on some free online courses and then college courses to start out my path to success. \n\nI guess in the end what I'm looking for is to know is it too late for me? I'm driven and passionate about making the difference in these men's lives. I know I can do it and from my reading, I know stanford is looking for people with an obsessive drive towards a certain goal and this one is mine. If you do think I can pursue this dream, what do you think I should do to make it a reality? I'll be 25 by the time I get out if it makes a difference",

From a prosthetics project I'm planing to start on when I get back, to wondering if going to community college in California would raise my chances compared to going to one in my state of residence. Would I be able to PM you questions?",

Maybe it would get more transfer credits but I'm not sure, the stanford website or failing that finding a contract address for stanford admissions and asking them should be able to answer re if it would have transfer credit benefits",

At Stanford, I've met plenty of 22-23 year old freshmen because their country forces them to do military service and there are quite a few ex-military at Stanford. You sound much better than the average high school brat who wants to go to Stanford for the prestige. You're a grown man and you should have a good chance at Stanford and where ever is lucky enough to have you.",

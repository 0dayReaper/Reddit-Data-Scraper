I heard somewhere that people go to top colleges feeling on top of the world, and then when they graduate their ambition lowers like crazy because they see everyone else.  \n\nJust curious. ",

Charlie Munger talks about this, search up if you are curious.\n\nI'm not a very good person to answer this question. I did not feel discouraged and my ambition has only increased since beginning at Stanford. I spent my time building things that I thought were interesting to me and learning things that I thought were useful. I also thought a *lot* about what was important to me and to the world.\n\nThe best general advice I would give is that lots of independent thinking and building things of value seems to be very good for self esteem (this is correlation not causation, but I did the former and I have the latter).",

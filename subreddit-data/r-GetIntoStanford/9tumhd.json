    "postText": "  \n\nHello everyone, \n\nAs the title states, what kinds of ECs could I do this November and December to boost my application? \n\nFor a little background on my past extracurriculars - I'm an international student currently in my senior year of high school. I spent my junior year in the USA as an exchange student, as part of a high school scholarship sponsored by the US Department of State - 29 students got selected for this program from my country, out of over 800 applicants. I got placed in Oakland, California, and during my exchange year I was able to take part in things such as:\n\nCivic Education Workshop: Week-long program in Washington DC, again sponsored by the Dept. of State - 100 students got selected out of 400 current exchange students that applied - we toured the national mall, met with state representatives, etc,\n\nTech Hive: 10 week-long STEM internship at Lawrence Hall of Science, UC Berkeley,\n\n... amongst other activities, including volunteering, high school soccer team (champions), etc., but the ones mentioned above would be the most notable.\n\nI wanted use these 2 months to further boost my extracurriculars because I feel like on the academic side of things, I did well but not AMAZING \u2013 nothing that stands out too much. My high school here doesn\u2019t have AP classes, and the high school I attended in the US was a small charter school \u2013 other than AP Stats, I didn\u2019t have other options.\n\nThanks and any help would be appreciated!",

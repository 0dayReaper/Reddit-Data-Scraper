There should be info about where to submit the stanford arts supp video here http://admission.stanford.edu/application/freshman/arts.html\n\nIf you didn't make the site from scratch -- Hm, that's a good question. My initial thought is I'm not sure. Might be worth an email to the arts supplement office. My other thought is you could probably submit it provided that you noted that it was you putting other templates together and wasn't all original creation. Mashups can still be art, and they can still be impressive art.",

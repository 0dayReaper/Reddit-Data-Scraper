So they would let me do 1/4 or 1/5 or less of the homework (especially in Math classes).\n\nIn hindsight I wish I had talked to teachers, told them my goals, how I want to spend my time, and asked them if I could've had even less homework provided I still scored well on tests, so that I could've spent more time on other things towards the goal of becoming better.",

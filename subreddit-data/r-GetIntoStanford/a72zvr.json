    "postText": "Hello all! I'm a sophomore in high school and Stanford is currently one of my top choices for PSE (I know it's early to be thinking about). I was wondering if any current students/generally smart people could check out my 'resume' (below) and guess what my standing is as of now, if you have any advice, etc. Here's what I've got so far:\n\n-GPA: 3.9 UW/4.38 W (only one AP class so far, but I will be taking more AP and college courses [PSEO] junior and senior year)\n\n-PSAT: 1220/94th percentile (the one I took this year doesn't count for anything, I will be studying next year before I take the real one!)\n\n-conversationally fluent in Spanish, Norwegian (hopefully fluent by my senior year!)\n\n-varsity swim team member for past 3 years\n\n-created an app for my state's Dept. of Natural Resources\n\n-participant in 'technovation' challenge, basically an app creation competition (this year, results pending)\n\n-extensive knowledge of/fluency in CSS/HTML\n\n-volunteers weekly at local natural history museum\n\n-swim teacher with Community Education\n\nThanks again y'all!",

And the process I believe is quite similar (from reading my Stanford application reader report thanks to FERPA it had a scoring method that seems to be identical to what the linked PDF talks about).",

I have two more slots left, and I have two more extracurriculars, but they incredibly common. 1) Member of debate club 2) Volunteering at local library. Should I just include these because I have some slots left? If I include these, am I at risk of detracting from my other, much more important EC's? Should I include them at all?\n\nQuestion is specifically directed at /u/129183-stan-ps",

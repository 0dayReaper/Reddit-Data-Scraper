I was rejected by most colleges because I didn't have goals or aspirations at the beginning of high school but now I do have crazy high dreams and ambitions. I will be attending my safety school for the next four years and never did I imagine going there.",

I completely agree with this statement, and after some reflection, there have definitely been opportunities so far in my life (I'm only a HS student) where I had information that I could have leveraged to my benefit, but have missed out on the chances. Is it possible to be more active in leveraging these secrets? How can I turn these secrets into habits to ensure that I always use them when I need them?",

One answer would be that if you have a strong vision for the future of the world, how it could/should be improved, and how you might go about doing that, then you will likely naturally think of ways that secrets you come to possess can be used to further your mission.\n\nYes, I think a generally good way is to have some goal you're aggressively pursuing and then you'll naturally use your secrets towards it.\n\nAdditionally - you could every so often look at the types of 'secrets' you possess, and then assess whether the goal you're pursuing is really the one where you have the strongest competitive advantage, or whether there are other goals/missions that your unique access and skills and potential make you more suited to pursue.",

If you were asking about doing this in a company, the answer might be to ensure that the strategy and plan you choose for your company reflects the competitive advantages that the company has now and can accumulate. So perhaps the answer is the same - ensure that your competitive advantage is given proper consideration when choosing your personal life strategy and life plan.\n\nI don't think it's something that needs to be actively done in specific situations - e.g. I don't think it's conscious thought. But I may be wrong. I think of it more as - you may be excellent at skill Z, and so if you choose to do things that require excellence at skill Z, then you'll tend to do well at those things. You don't need to actively emphasize your edge in the moment, but you do want to consider it when you're deciding your plan / strategy - i.e. when you're deciding what you will be doing.",

This is hypocritical, because much of my income is passive. But that said, I think it's generally the wrong approach in terms of hours invested vs dollars out, for most people.\n\nI think the best approach for making $3000 total is to take some kind of contract job. Likely design, development, marketing or sales. You can find these online at Upwork and similar, or depending on where you live you may be able to network for a gig. Alternatively, find a design/development/sales/marketing consultancy and convince them that you'll be a useful part-time or contract team member for them - this way you remove what is normally the most time consuming part for anyone initially (finding good and paying clients).\n\nThe best approach for making $3000/month is likely to get some kind of remote job (either a full-time or part-time position, or contract work) - again likely design, development, marketing or sales.\n\nThese approaches work well. You can follow them until you have a certain amount saved, and then quit, and be able to live for a few years just on your savings without actively working.",

They did have the hype benefit earlier, but I also don't think that's a particularly important benefit - I generally believe that great founders and great companies will be able to raise the money they need (not always, but more true than not) - so ICOs don't help them get something they couldn't otherwise\n\n- I think when you're raising money you should be treating investors as partners, and I believe you should only do deals where you'd accept the deal if you were on the other end, and I think many ICOs violate this (e.g. silly prices, utility tokens that should trend towards $0, etc)\n\n- I think selling security tokens online could be interesting, though you'd still want to comply with all the laws, which makes it less beneficial I think (though I'm not sure what the deal is with international investors)\n\nOverall: Overhyped, not really worth thinking about UNTIL you get to the point where money is truly your gating factor.\n\nSide note: Money is *almost never* the true limiting factor. Most people trick themselves into thinking that money will solve their problems and allow them to make progress on their company, but the reality is that the limiting factor is usually something else.",

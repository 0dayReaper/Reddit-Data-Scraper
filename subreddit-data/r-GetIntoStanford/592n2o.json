            "comment": "Depends what you want to do.\nI spent an amazingly low time on schoolwork while at Stanford. For 3/4 years perhaps 5-10hrs/week of total class time + homework. For 1/4 years perhaps 10-15hrs/week of total class time + homework. Final GPA was a 3.6 or 3.7 or something. I'm not a fan of regular jobs so I didn't care at all for my GPA other than residual effects from wanting high grades as a kid occasionally recurring and making me not want to do *terribly*.\n\nTl;dr -- No. Though depends what you want. If you wanna work at Google, it's helpful to get high grades. If you can create value for yourself and be independent or you expect you'll start companies and things like this, getting anything above passing grades on anything that isn't deeply interesting to you is a waste of time. i.e. learn as much as you want about the things that are deeply interesting to you but don't bother to optimize for grades",

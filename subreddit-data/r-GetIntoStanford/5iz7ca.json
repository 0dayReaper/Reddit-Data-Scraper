    "postText": "How bad is it if you go to college with no real work experience? At colleges like Stanford, MIT, Harvard, etc. would students without any real work experience and a highly competitive resume still be able to take advantage of the opportunities offered? How many students that go to these top colleges already have resumes that seem like they've been in their fields for like 50 years? For students who begin with little to know experience, how would one \"catch up?\" Is it possible to considering these people who have been provided with these opportunities throughout their entire lives will most likely be the ones who get the most desirable internships, jobs, etc.?\n\nFor example, the resumes of these individuals can be seen here:\n\nhttps://stvp.stanford.edu/dfj/\nhttp://stvp.stanford.edu/mayfield-fellows-program/\nhttps://stvp.stanford.edu/ais/\n\nLastly, as an entrepreneur, do you believe it is important to have any work experience or internships at all considering you won't be \"applying\" for a job, but rather creating your own one? Can you be a successful entrepreneur without having a stacked resume from a young age?",

(other viewpoints also possible like creating maximum impact for the world and so on, but money made is a reasonable proxy)",

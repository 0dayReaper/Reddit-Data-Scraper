Like Peter Thiel was US Chess Master before 21, Musk sold a game for $100 when 12yrs.\n\nMy question is how does success at a young age translate to success when you are older? Is it still possible to be average when you were young and accomplish a huge amount like Jobs, Musk, etc.\n",

There are examples of people who have done nothing major until they were 40 or older, and then been wildly impactful. e.g. http://www.businessinsider.com/people-who-became-successful-after-age-40-2014-9/\n\nThat said, early success is a good indicator. e.g. http://pmarchive.com/age_and_the_entrepreneur.html\n\n\nHOWEVER -- depends on what you define as early. If you didn't really do anything before age 20, start succeeding a lot between age 20 and 25, this will be a strong predictor of success at age 40. i.e., if you were 40 and asking this question, you have more to come back from, though still possible, but at 20, easy.",

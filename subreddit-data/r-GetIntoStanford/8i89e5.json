            "comment": "I think that the largest challenges one would face are differences in language and technology. I know that young people in India generally have decent English abilities, but China and some parts of Africa may be lacking in this regard.\n\nAs well, I would presume that many people there don't have great consistent access to the internet or related technologies. I was recently reading about a startup called Arist (https://www.arist.co/) that is delivering courses to people in India through SMS.\n\nPS. If you want to talk to a few (~15) ambitious tech-focused young people from India I can get you in contact. I'm not Indian myself but I am acquainted with some of the top student coders in India.",

If you do it on a Chinese platform, there will be more attention. Also, you don't need to post in Chinese, English will do, as the young and ambitious young people in China all speak English to some degree. If you do want to also post in Chinese, there should be plenty of volunteers who would translate for you.",

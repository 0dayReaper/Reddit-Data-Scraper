He also might not have worded his achievements as well as he could've. Is it surprising that he got rejected everywhere? Yeah. Will we ever know why? Probably not unless you read his whole app. The main thing he did wrong really is only apply to ivies and one safety he didn't like. I know this sub is \"getting into Stanford\" but like all the other elites, guarantees don't exist. ",

They are impressive, and I'm more surprised that they were rejected than I would be if they were accepted, but to me, they sound like someone who was ticking all the boxes, who wasn't thinking for themselves. If I'm extreme about it, it seems like they did all of these things *to get into a good college* not because they were deeply interested in these things.",

    "postText": "I copied this from another thread about how much \"luck\" there was in the admissions process: \n&gt;Eh. I'd say there's a decent amount of luck. My sister had great but not fantastic stats and a few generic ECs, but she got in. She gives off a smart vibe instead of a try hard one, though my family really didn't think she'd get in. She already took a semester off though and I *think* she's dropping out this year because of health and not liking the school. \n       \nI say think because I'm fairly certain as she's taking a 3rd successive quarter in a row off and she was on academic probation yea...\n         \nFYI she was going to major in Symbolic Systems/CS stuff or whatnot and is half-ORM half-white like I am. She did the IB diploma, top of her class, her essays were fairly good although a bit dry. Our family is basically \"middle class\" in Southern California and would have definitely appeared that way to the admissions officers - although our family income was LOW (think sub 20k) for several years (she would have gotten 4 years for free lol...)  \n       \ni personally think the school was a poor fit for her and so does she now, I think she might have been able to do her CS major if not for some seasonal health issues, but even so it seems like she really didn't make many friends and preferred Berkeley people. And yeah it's pretty upsetting if you can get FOUR YEARS FOR FREE everything FOR FREE at Stanford despite having a fairly middle class family background and you don't even try to get an English major or something easy instead of friggin' SYMBOLIC SYSTEMS OR COMP SCI. \n     \nSo obviously the admissions department is not all-seeing. \n       \nIdk. Maybe she was a mistake and wasn't smart enough, maybe they let her in for women in STEM or something, idk. Personally I think she _was smart enough but it was still a poor fit for *her*._ She definitely likes the crowd at Berkeley sooooo much better. There were just a lot of reasons she didn't like stanford although she did say i should apply. \n       \nSo for god's sake don't put the school on a pedestal, my sister got almost as good financial aid offers from the UCs as well and if she had gone to Berkeley maybe it would be been better for her. At least that's what everyone in my family thinks, me included.",

I don't have much to add there. If Stanford is full of \"your people\" then it's probably the school for you, and I'd say it's decently easy to know that if you've visited and have an honest assessment of yourself. I knew that for myself, and it certainly proved to be true for me (I thought Stanford was for me, I couldn't have been more correct).",

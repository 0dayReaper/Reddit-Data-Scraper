I tried searching online, but I got conflicting information.\n\nPersonally I think you should apply EA for these benefits: a) you get to meet other stanford students earlier in the facebook group b) you don't have to apply to other schools because you know you got your top choice. \n\nI wrote all my essays in 2 weeks or so. The subject tests aren't that important. \n\n\nIf you don't apply EA, the only good reason would be to do something else AWESOME that the admission officer would say to another admission officer as a reason why you should be accepted. Essays can go from nothing to awesome in 2 weeks with ~2hrs/day, without a doubt.",

If it's just for updating their expectations and there's nothing else that needs to change, then it's no big deal\n\nAlso what's the relevance of the same resume/different resume? I'm not exactly sure what you mean.",

    "postText": "I'm not certain, however\n\n- I went to a meeting with someone who was recruiting alumni for interviews\n\n- my strong conclusion from what they said was that interviews have almost no impact, except possibly in extreme positive or negative cases\n\n- they said that people who don't do interviews are not at a disadvantage\n\n- my interpretation was that interviews are a tool for Stanford to maximize yield (admitted people who accept offers) which they are doing mostly because other top schools are doing it. \n\n- it seems like interviews are more about selling you, than you selling them (at least from Stanford's perspective). So maybe tell them a brief summary of your story so far and spend the rest of the time asking them Q's on how to maximize your time at Stanford? Just an idea that I think would create a positive impression on most people (eg confident, thoughtful, etc)\n\nOverall I wouldn't be too worried about the interviews.\n\nIf you want to optimize; read the book \"how to win friends and influence people\" and maybe also \"the Challenger sale.\" (You're effectively a salesperson and they are a potential customer)",

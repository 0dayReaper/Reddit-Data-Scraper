    "postText": "Because of a non-profit I work with, I have access to a pool of business leaders in my area (not a gigantic city, but plenty of business here; think Cleveland, Baltimore, Tampa, Milwaukee). Reaching out to them and talking to them is not an issue. I'd like to find a project to work on to solve a problem that one of these businesses have.\n\nHow would you recommend figuring out what to work on?\n\nI'm in the mentoring course and have read over all of the resources related to customer development/interaction. I feel like a lot of the advice in the mentoring course on this subject is geared towards testing hypotheses, but since I haven't had any exposure to these businesses (they are varied), I don't have a huge depth of knowledge in their fields.\n\nGiven the fact that I don't have any specific ideas yet, how should I go about finding them? I want to have the idea pulled out of me by the problem(s) I discover, but I want to make sure I ask the right questions.\n\nFinally, what should I do to be taken seriously as a high schooler? The people I'll interact with have a degree of respect for me by default because of my background, but they definitely won't think of me as someone who can solve their biggest problems.\n\n\u200b\n\nThanks for any advice.",

(As opposed to starting a startup. I think that might be better avoided for now until you have a unique insight that makes you feel so compelled to start a startup that you have no other option)\n\nAssuming that -- I might suggest that you:\n\n1) identify your skills\n\n2) identify what these businesses spend money on (my guesses = hiring employees/building their product, and acquiring customers, and those are probably the main things)\n\n3) identify what the biggest overlap is\n\nI'd basically answer \"what should I work on\" with \"what will people pay me to do, now?\" Let the market dictate what it thinks you're valuable for.\n\nThings to consider would be stuff like SEO services for them, handling facebook ads for them, doing web design and hosting, etc.\n\nProbably a good way to choose is to list out the items and services that they spend the most money on but are the least satisfied with and most willing to switch to a new provider (and ones that you could feasibly do better at). You could figure this out with interviews with them.\n\n&gt; Given the fact that I don't have any specific ideas yet, how should I go about finding them? I want to have the idea pulled out of me by the problem(s) I discover, but I want to make sure I ask the right questions.\n\nMake it simpler.\n\nRather than looking for a unique idea, force yourself to do something that isn't unique. That other people are already making money doing. And just do it better or cheaper or faster or more personalized etc.\n\nI think this is a better way to ultimately succeed - to start out with success in business as a first step. You'll notice that many of the most successful entrepreneurs had smaller businesses first and I think this is no accident (travis kalanick had a tutoring business, mark zuckerberg had a music player thing, bill gates had traffic light software, steve jobs sold phone call hacking things, etc)\n\n&gt; Finally, what should I do to be taken seriously as a high schooler? The people I'll interact with have a degree of respect for me by default because of my background, but they definitely won't think of me as someone who can solve their biggest problems.\n\nDress well. Work on your presence. Record yourself talking and practice over and over until you seem respectable -- use this method https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140320175655-176238488-learn-to-speak-or-teach-better-in-30-minutes. \n\nAnd then in terms of solving their specific problems -- step 1 which might last for a few weeks will be to info gather until you're an EXPERT. Like this \"When I first had to write a series of letters to real-estate agents, I knew nothing about their business. What did I do? I went to the public library and read several years' back issues of the trade journals that real-estate agents subscribe to and read. One of the largest real-estate companies had its convention in my city, so I went and hung out in the hotel lobby and bars and eavesdropped on conversations. I took a real-estate agent to lunch and pumped him for information. I got myself to the point where I could visualize myself as a real-estate agent and speak the language of a real-estate agent\"\n\nAnd then you'll of course need to become an expert at the product you're selling. By reading books, talking to experts etc.\n\nAnd then once you've done that, you could construct a pitch according to the book \"The Challenger Sale\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nDoes that all make sense? What qs do you have?",

I think that might be better avoided for now until you have a unique insight that makes you feel so compelled to start a startup that you have no other option)\n\nThat's essentially what I'm looking to do. Learning is my number one priority, but I think there's a lot of overlap with making money and learning in this case.\n\n1. identify your skills\n\nI'm decent with design and development (good with Java, JS, HTML, CSS). That said, I only learn these skills when I have a need for them. For instance, for one of my projects I needed to know some Java, so I taught all of the Java I needed to know for the project, nothing more.\n\n&gt;3. identify what the biggest overlap is\n\nThere might be an overlap with some of my skills, but a lot of the stuff I know is pretty specialized. In the case that no overlap jumps out, would it make sense to pick something that I could most conceivably acquire the skills to build? That's how I've approached my projects in the past, and it seems to work well.\n\n&gt;And then once you've done that, you could construct a pitch according to the book \"The Challenger Sale\"\n\nWould you recommend reading the entire book? Or would a summary be sufficient? I know that u/129183-stan-ps suggests that reading summaries is sufficient in some cases.\n\nThanks for the help. I appreciate your time. u/FutureFounderTrainer",

    "postText": "Hi friends, I'm wondering what to put in the additional info section? My main strengths as an applicant are my leadership and artistic abilities. In my additional info section, I wanted to write about how I had an emotionally abusive frisbee coach in ninth grade, but am now being considered for my country's national frisbee team. Is this worth writing about? Will AOs be annoyed by having to read more? Will it distract from my narrative?\n\nOr I could put a link to a news interview I did talking about I'm combatting my provincial government's massive massive funding cuts to education. Could I do both?",

In current applications to grad school and jobs, I explain that a severe drop in grades in my third quarter was at the same time as the death of my brother.",

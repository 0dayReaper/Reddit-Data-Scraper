If you have 3 or less in the grey boxes, there's a 99.5% chance that you don't have it (assuming that I'm reading these boxes correctly).\n\nI've removed people's answers, in case they wouldn't want others seeing them now that what it is has been revealed. \n\nIf you think you may have ADHD, my recommendations:\n\n- Read the book \"Taking Charge of Adult ADHD\"\n\n- Then consider finding a psychiatrist with experience dealing with ADHD and see them.\n\n- Skim read \"New ADHD Medication Rules\" before you consider taking meds.",

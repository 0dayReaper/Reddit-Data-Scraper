    "postText": "Hi guys.\n\nI'm an international student interested in both CS and Philosophy. I saw Stanford's joint program and I'm interested in it. But as a foreign student who would still be adapting to the new life in the US, do you think a double major is just a waste of effort, like, an additional burden that I would do better without?\n\nAnd which major should I declare as my intended major in my application? Many international students apply for CS, so some people told me that declaring Philosophy as my major in the application would increase my chances for admission, but CS programs are selective so I fear maybe I would not be allowed to declare it as a second major later? How do things work at stanford? Should I just declare CS as my desired major and later on declare Philosophy as a second major/minor?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "With regards to whether you want to double major or major/minor or even take both I think you can figure that out and try different things at Stanford given the academic freedom it has + you get an academic advisor IIRC. You could also look into Symbolic Systems and CS+X.\n\nI can't speak for if you should do a double major or not / the burden / the benefits. Moderator of this sub might be able to. I think you should ask on /r/stanford about these questions as well.\n\nYour \"intended majors\" are just what you think you want to take. You can put CS on the intended major and then choose something completely different like History at Stanford if you want I think (it's very easy to switch majors apparently at Stanford).\n\nI don't think it'll really raise your chances if you list philosophy as something you're interested in majoring in. Just list the things you really are interested in. If philosophy comes up in your application (so like courses, essays, LOR, activities) as something you are interested in and makes you a more interesting or impressive candidate **that's** what will mostly benefit you. If you show you care a lot about philosophy and do stuff w/ it then put it in intended majors then that will be most helpful.\n\nI think philosophy and CS were the two biggest academic components of my application to Stanford (I was accepted REA). I put for my intended majors:\n\n1: Symbolic Systems\n\n2: CS+X\n\n3: Philosophy\n\nI don't think if I changed or removed these it would make a difference.",

Yeah I was just concerned maybe I wouldn't be able to choose a major that hasn't been on my application haha.\n\nActually I am **really** interested in both xD CS and Philosophy have both been my most favorite subjects in high school. My application emphasizes both programming related activities and creative writing, and my essay in particular accentuates my rebellious mindset and thinking. So while I did not have ECs related to Philosophy, my essay shows my aptitude for humanities. Actually I had an admission tutor who even recommended I apply for a humanities major rather than CS, which brings me to the other point, because almost all international students apply for CS and other STEM majors, so applying for humanities would make me stand out among the international pool.\n\nAnd thank you so much for the advice!\n\nEdit: Btw congrats on the acceptance!",

                            "comment": "No worries, and thanks. I disagree with your admission tutors mindset. Again you don't \"apply for\" a specific major to Stanford. You show who you are and what you've done and what you'd be interested in studying. You apply for a spot in the class not for a specific department. Honestly if you have so many programming related activities then AOs can probably infer that you're going to take part in CS and STEM. And you should really just put down what you WANT to study. Simply applying with a specified interest in humanities won't make you \"stand out\". Doing cool and impressive stuff will make you stand out -- with the humanities or without it. Which you say you do and that is great.",

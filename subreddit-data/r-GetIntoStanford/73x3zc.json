If it's similar to the essay when sat was 2400 I'd be shocked if it was important\n\nSo yes I'd be pretty sure it's sufficient and would be surprised if the admission readers focused on that part of the score at all\n\nTesting pretty much seems to get broken down to one overall bucket that is scored from 1-5\n\nFocus on other areas of your app, this won't make enough of a difference to be worth effort",

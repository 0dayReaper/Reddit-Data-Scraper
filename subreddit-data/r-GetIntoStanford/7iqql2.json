    "postText": "Options include\n\n- Gap year and try again next year\n\n- Identify everything you want in a school and then conduct a thorough research process to find a second best alternative and apply to that school\n\nI like both options. I think the value prop of Stanford that is harder to find a substitute for is the brand, but I think that most of the other (and in my opinion many of the most important) value propositions have good substitutes. e.g. want to find a good technical co-founder? Perhaps U Waterloo or UIUC. etc.\n\nI think the default process for choosing schools used by almost all people, including those who apply to and get into Stanford, is probably pretty bad. You would be very well served to follow a better process for your college selection - this 80000 Hours process is intended for career selection, but it applies and will add lots of value here too - https://80000hours.org/articles/making-an-assessment/. Warning, it requires time investment and thoughtfulness. But, I believe it will have a very strong ROI for anyone that goes through the process.\n\nFor many but not all value props of Stanford there are good alternatives.",

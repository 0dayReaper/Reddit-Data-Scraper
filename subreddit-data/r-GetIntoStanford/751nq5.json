    "postText": "https://youtu.be/u8duppSmEvw\n\nGood points:\n\n- A screenshot of Stanford's rubric for Intellectual Vitality from when the Dean of Admissions worked there is in the video. Good points like \"lots of AP and college courses, long term papers, and academic summer research projects do not guarantee [IV],\" \"excellence in certain intellectual activities is reflected in IV rating,\" \"have shown significant responsibility for own learning process,\" \"show maturity and self-discipline in the fulfillment of a project, often well beyond the limitations of a school assignment\"\n\n- At times, a perfect SAT score in some cases can hurt you. This is because the student only showed dedication to a standardized test that \"[the AOs] didn't think measured much\"\n\n- Intellectual Vitality; Purpose, Passion, and Meaning; Challenges Met &amp; Overcome; Character; Leadership. Note that being athletic isn't on that list.\n\n- Stanford isn't a place to memorize things, it's a place for the student that thinks \"I got an idea and I want to try it.\" Out-of-the-box thinkers, tinkerers, and kids who were never satisfied with a good mark and SAT score and moved on. \n\n",

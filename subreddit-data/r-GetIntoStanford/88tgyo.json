    "postText": "Well, everyone, I have been rejected by every ivy school I applied to and have not garnered the courage to check my one dream school's decision: Stanford University. I feel as if I have been plagued all my life with a chain of miserable events and bad luck. I feel as if my future rests on the thread of a thread. These events have ripped all the thread by which I am hanging onto. I just wish for one good thing to happen to me.\n\nThis is not just about getting into my dream school, this about redemption for all the years of bad luck and wretched relationships/ events in my family and school. In general, I believe I won't be able to go to college due to my family/economic situation unless a miracle like Stanford happens. But i feel as if something like a Stanford acceptance is something too good to ever happen to me. I have even prayed for something good to happen to me before I become an adult. Then again, who am I, an agnostic boy, to wish for god in my time of need when I refused to believe in him in the past?\n\nAcceptance at Stanford would validate my past and prove my parents that I'm able to achieve something. It would make my younger self proud. It would create hope and increase my ambition to do something worthwhile in the world. I just wish for one good thing, acceptance at Stanford is possibly the only good thing I can think of.\n\nI don't know when I'll be brave enough to check my decision but im 99.98% sure I have been rejected considering one girl got accepted at my school already.\n\nIts 1 AM and I think I am going to go and cry myself to bed again. I just want one good thing please.",

            "comment": "Please, please, please don't seek external validation of any sort. In life, depending on others to validate your own life decisions leaves you very vulnerable to failure as those around you have the propensity to let you down regardless of your aptitude, etc. The truth is, college admissions are extremely random - often as terrible as a lottery - and many very qualified students are rejected from very good schools. About 8 of my peers at my high school were accepted to ivy league schools, yet our valedictorian--who, arguably, had the best hooks/extracirriculars of our year, was rejected from all of them despite being the perfect candidate. Admissions officers have to choose between thousands of equally qualified candidates for just a few spots and they have to make a call somewhere. \n\nDon't let Stanford, or any school, drag you down. The fact that you've been so successful in high school is testimony to your propensity for success in the future no matter where you attend. I've had to turn down some fantastic t20 schools out of my price range for a 'mediocre' school that's given me great merit aid, and I'm enthusiastic to attend the college and continue learning. Our goals shouldn't be college admissions--they should extend to changing the world around us beyond university.",

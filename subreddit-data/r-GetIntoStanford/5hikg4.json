The essay was about my relationship with another young iOS developer who lives in Long Island and has mentored me since age 13. We do/have done all our apps and stuff together and I talked about how my success is because of his willingness to share his passion and knowledge with me (when I first met him online I was shit at coding!!) I talked about how I took that and perpetuated it in my own community and discussed how, in life, I want to continue learning from people and thereafter paying it forward/teaching others. Initially I wrote about mentorship but then I realized\u2014no this is more about the cycle of sharing knowledge and passion with people.\n\n- Biggest challenge society faces: I talked about artificial intelligence and how I think it poses an existential threat to not just many many jobs but also humanity in general. PM me if you wanna talk about this and/or are into machine learning cause it's fun haha.",

We loan through Kiva. \n\nI go to a public school with more than 3500 students.\n\nI can force parents to give 25 each lol\n\nSome universities have donated millions: https://www.kiva.org/kivau/directory",

Focus on the unity aspect that whoever you are targeting is on the same team as the people they are loaning to - the team of humanity. That they all want the same thing.\n\nHow do you currently raise money? What have been the most successful channels so far?\n\nIs my understanding correct that you are basically helping Kiva source lenders?",

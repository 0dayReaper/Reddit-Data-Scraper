Of course, I'll do this because I really want the experience anyways, but would this help my chances of being accepted when I apply?",

But still, I don't think it's the best option unless like you say you're doing it because you want the experience anyway.\n\nIn terms of boosting chances: Instead, spend a summer learning things that really interest you and building things of value that Stanford can see are valuable.\n\nMany many more valuable things you can do with your time than something like that in my opinion.",

    "postText": "So I originally planned on going to community college and trying to transfer after one year to Stanford to try and get accepted. I originally had a family and economic crisis which caused everything my senior year of high school to backfire. But for a school like Stanford which is my very top choice, I know the transfer rate is almost nothing. I know I would have a better chance at admission if I apply as freshmen. And I do plan on being busy and expanding my resume if I were to take a gap year and reapply. Usually, I don't ask because everyone always tells me to settle for less so advice on what to do to reach my goal would be very appreciated instead of telling me not to reach too high. I know it will be hard, very hard but I am still set on trying. So should I take a gap year??",

I have been the only one working in my family for the past 2 years. My brother and sister have special needs too. I went through a family crisis. I said it in my post, did you read it?",

            "comment": "&gt; How do you push yourself to directly jump into the development stage of a product, even if you don't know much about the industry?\n\nYou probably shouldn't. You'd likely be better served starting with a lot of learning, e.g. \"customer development\" and market research type stuff. Talk to potential users!\n\n&gt; How do you schedule work time for it in relation to your other smaller responsibilities (such as school, a writing position, etc.)?\n\nSo this question could mean multiple things.\n\nThe easy answer is simply, you put your responsibilities in your calendar, and you schedule time in your calendar to work on this.\n\nIf you've been doing that but not following through, then perhaps ask yourself why? Why does some part of you not want to work on this startup, and why does some part of you want to do whatever it is that you've been doing instead?\n\n&gt; What do you do to familiarize yourself w/ your product/industry as fast as possible?\n\nI generally like:\n\n1. Read all the best books on the topic you can find on amazon\n\n2. Read a few good blogs/twitter feeds of experts in the space\n\n3. Interview experts from the space, and relevant people from the space (e.g. potential customers, people currently running companies in the space, etc)\n\n&gt; How do you usually go about finding a mentor? Or do you prefer not to have one?\n\nGenerally I like the approach of doing think in terms of mentor, think in terms of individual challenges and questions. And then find the person who is most suited to answering that individual question, send them a very short cold email asking that question very directly (see: http://www.michaelseibel.com/blog/how-to-ask-for-advice). Now just repeat this with everything that you'd ask a \"mentor\" if you had one. Benefits: 1) You generally can get your questions answered, and pretty quickly! Send the same question to 2-3 people if you want. But be very targeted, don't send it to tons of people without a great reason. 2) You often end up with a mentor, because someone will see you have interesting questions and challenges, and they'll develop a relationship with you over time\n\nLast note -- often a lot of the issue is in forming the question properly. Do *not* send someone a super long email. You should first talk the issue out loud with a smart friend of yours, with no goal other than to properly define your problem/question. Only once you've done that and can crisply define the question and exactly who is likely to know the answer, should you send someone a cold email asking them.\n\nGenerally also always look for the answer in books and blog posts first before emailing someone to ask.\n\nIf you're not sure what your question for them really is, then read a book on the general topic or continue to talk/think through the problem out loud with a friend who is good at asking questions.",

In reading Cal Newport's \"High School Superstar,\" I discovered what he called SMPs, or Saturday Morning Projects. If I'm extremely hungry to create a successful start-up, do you think a start-up idea should be in SMP territory until successful? Or should it be everyday work until it hits either a \"make\" or a \"break\" point, at which point I'd either continue with more intensity or move on?",

Depends on your goals is the honest answer I can give.\n\nIf you're able to dedicate 100% of your time and your goals are best served by starting a company and making it successful, then that may be best.\n\nBut if you have other obligations and cannot, and your goals don't really require a startup or perhaps your goals do but you're not *that* obsessed with achieving them, then another schedule is probably better.\n\nSo it all depends on what you want.",

I would like to add that your start-up doesn\u2019t have to do something new or ground breaking to be successful but instead you could analyze companies who are dominating the current market and find their weaknesses (such as overcomplicated UI, high fees, lack of features) and create a start-up that solves these problems.\n\n",

If success or $ is your metric of success, then taking companies that are already successful and doing a better version of them is probably a better route in many cases. e.g. when Google was founded there were already other search engines doing ~$100mm in yearly revenue. Google just did it better.",

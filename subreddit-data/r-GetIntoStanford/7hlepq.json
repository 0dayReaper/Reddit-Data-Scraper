    "postText": "Hello,\n\nWhere can we get actual statistics on the average/percentile GPA's of people admitted to Stanford??\n\nAlso, I have a 3.8 GPA (2 AP's sophomore, 5 AP's junior) and am extremely worried about this. Do you think a high SAT/ACT (I have 1590/35) can make up for this?\n\nThanks",

Stanford's application process is holistic, so they look at a mix of everything. Good ECs, awards, essays, test scores can definitely balance out a GPA.",

            "comment": "It'll definitely affect the tech industry, in my opinion. Already on Facebook, many of my Iraqi friends are complaining about not being able to attend Hackathons and several Silicon Valley tech companies said that the ban affects a large portion of their employees directly. I'm a Muslim as well, though not from one of the banned countries, but I'm still terrified of whether Trump will expand the ban to more countries, preventing me from attending college.\n\nAlso, on another side note, it's really sad to see that many students on /r/ApplyingToCollege that are from these countries and were accepted early to Stanford, MIT, Harvard, etc. may not be able to attend college if the ban is extended. Imagine being one of the few lucky internationals to get admitted only to have that ripped away in moments. Trump has effectively banned 130,000,000 people in order to prevent a few bad apples from entering. It's truly disgusting.\n\nEDIT: Pathos",

Most school shooters are white, does that mean you should ban all white people from going to school in fear of the few evil people? And a lot of the recent terroris attacks in the US have been by US citizens (e.g. the Dallas shooting).\n\nAnd what's sad is that the terrorists will still find another way to get in. It's the normal, legit people who are being hurt the most.\n\nI'm not a Muslim, so the ban won't affect me personally, but this is making me strongly reconsider applying to the US next year. The general racist attitude has been seriously worrying me. What other countries have strong tech/startup scenes + good for internationals/immigration? I've been looking at Canada, Australia, and Germany, but do you guys have any suggestions? /u/129183-stan-ps",

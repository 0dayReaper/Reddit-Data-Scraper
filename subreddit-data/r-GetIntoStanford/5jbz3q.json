But I don't want to give a bad first impression so I'd like if someone could proofread it for me and tell me if I gave a bad vibe unintentionally, and to see if there are any gramar or spelling mistakes.\n\nI didn't know who else to ask so I asked here, sorry for being kinda off-topic.\n\nThe email has some personal info so I'll be sending it by PM.\n\nThank you!",

    "postText": "get to wealth and freedom faster by participating in this working group of ambitious people working on getting right without getting lucky, and optimize your speed of learning.\n\ngetting rich without getting lucky is a great goal. but it's hard to know specifically what to do. and not finding the path to wealth sucks, because realistically the alternatives are lame \u2013\u00a0working for others, or trying to find the path to wealth but taking so long that you waste the best years of your life and can't enjoy the freedom that wealth brings.\n\nand i can attest that it feels *so good* to get to the point where you have good finances, say &gt;$200k/yr consistent income without needing to spend too much time working, or $1mm liquid net worth. i used to advise people to go straight for their moonshot idea but now i'm much more in the camp that it's best to get to a solid financial position first - it feels so much better.\n\nso i've been exploring ways to provide support, guidance, advice, and to share experiences and ideas, to help people \"get rich without getting lucky.\" (for anyone who's seen the previous posts, this is an updated version of /u/FeynmanThomas's thing)\n\nthe idea is that if people can learn from each other about what works and what doesn't, that everyone will get to wealthy sooner.\n\ni'm personally already financially successful, and so i thought i'd be able to teach people how to get to financial success too. i tried, but i didn't succeed. because my path worked for me but i don't know how to make it repeatable for someone new without financial resources. so now i've concluded that the best way to help people get to financial success is to create an environment where everyone can learn from other ambitious people pursuing the same goals, where the group learning can discover the repeatable path to wealth. learning from many people's experiences, not just your own. \n\nrequirements to participate\n\n* no financial costs, just time\n\n* video call with me within the first month, and then once per 3 months after that\n\n* submit a weekly progress report airtable form. it asks your progress: what you tried, what you learned, and what you're trying next. if you miss two weeks in a row, you'll be removed from the program.\n\nbenefits of participating\n\n* once you're 2 weeks after your 2nd update in i'll send a bunch of my resources and current best hypotheses about the most deterministic (least luck) path to wealth for young ambitious people\n\n* every so often, i'll aggregate the learnings and what's been tried and not by the various participants and send out an email summarizing those anonymized learnings, so you iterate and learn 10x+ as fast\n\n* occasionally based on your updates if i have relevant info, tips, etc that would save you time, i'll send you an email\n\nwant in? -&gt; sign up here, and then you'll get an email within the next week to get started: https://airtable.com/shrBsWwOioQNgmwu5\n\np.s. spots are limited for now because of my personal time capacity, i'll plan on adding more spots at some point in the future, but please submit soon if you're interested so that you get in before i close new additions.",

(actually, back then i was mostly obsessed with getting recurring income).\n\ni think this is a no brainer for anyone ambitious that's been spending lots of time trying to get rich. if you're interested in getting rich but haven't actually been spending your time on it, then it's probably not for you. it requires time, but it's free in terms of $.\n\nthe goal is to allow you to discover the path that will allow you to get rich without getting lucky much faster than you'd figure out on your own, by learning from your peers in this course. i'll be anonymizing and aggregating and sharing the lessons.  naval's tweetstorm was awesome and inspirational, and this is designed to fill in some of the missing pieces.\n\nif you have any hesitations, questions, concerns or hesitations, please send me a PM or comment below!",

Spending time in pursuit of getting rich might look like spending time acquiring skills that you think will help. But if you're not spending time directly making money and you haven't been spending much time acquiring skills or doing things that you think will help, then you're not a good fit. Basically, ask yourself how many hours over the last month you put towards things in the pursuit of getting rich (directly, or to learn things or acquire skills that you hope will help later). If it's a high number, then you're a fit. If it's nonexistent or very low, you're not a fit. Hope that makes sense! I realize my answer is a bit wordy, so if it's not clear, please ask follow up questions as they're appreciated.",

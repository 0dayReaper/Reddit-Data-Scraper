    "postText": "LOOKING FOR A STANFORD STUDENT- Hello everyone, I am a rising senior and of course like most people my dream is getting into Stanford. My sister currently goes to Berkley so it would also be a fun rivalry with her if I get in! Are there any *Stanford students/graduates* who would be willing to read my essay and give some feedback? It would be sooo much appreciated. I can message you privately as I don't want to publicly post it here. Thank you in advance!",

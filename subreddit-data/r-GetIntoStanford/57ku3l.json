If PD is what you are most interested in and most WANT (ignore fit with background) to study, then put that\n\nWhy do you think so? \n\n/u/129183-stan-ps\n\n\n ",

It was a bonus that I knew there would be less SymSys applicants so it might help me stand out (in hindsight, this would *never* be a reason someone would get rejected or accepted. people only get rejected from stanford because of a lack of reason to accept them, unless they've committed a felony or something on this level).\n\nSo in short, I think the best application is the most authentic one, and putting down the honest majors you are most interested major is part of that.\n\nAs a side note, it frustrates me how much college essay advice is, frankly, crap, in my opinion, if it talks about focusing on writing style over authentic content then I believe it's bad advice.",

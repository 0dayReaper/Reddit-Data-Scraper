    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI am currently a 10th grader and was wondering what I could do to make my EC stick out more. At the moment I can't help but think about what I do and see it as bland. I'm trying to think of what I can do to generate more value, as all I can think of is how many other people are likely doing the same as me.\n\nMy EC:\nRobotics team (FRC + FTC)\n\nTraining for the USACO \n\nStudying for certification test like the CCNA/OSCP/NET+\n \nTrying to learn enough so that I can hopefully work with a professor at my local university. \n\nI am a part of a Defcon group that goes to defcon every year, and we compete in CTF challenges, host events. \n\nWhat else should I be trying to do, start a business? \n\nMy second question is after we have read through the mentorship links, how do we start the process of a project? Or is that something that we come to you with, and you simply monitor our progress? \n\n",

Do whatever seems like it might be interesting to you and potentially needed by the world, and wanted by the world\n\nin general if you don't have burning things that seem super interesting or things about the world that are frustrating you / problems you want to solve, my prescription would be for you to go and expose yourself to the world to see problems. either travel, talk to lots of people and ask them about their problems, practice noticing your own problems (get a notebook and for a few days write down whenever you experience a frustration no matter how minor), read books to learn about the world. \n\nsecond question: you start a project if you want to start a project, you can show me the results if you want to, etc. no requirements -- the people who succeed big in the world are those with determination to succeed big or solve some large problem (though don't worry they don't start out that way despite what they say, when they are teenagers it often looks more like they are just doing projects that help them get money than they are specifically trying to save the world e.g. see warren buffett, it changes over time) -- anyhow, i don't want to create any artificial requirements. just do things that you think are interesting and fun/energizing, and i'd love to see them and feel free to show them to me if you're interested in what i have to say",

But you could (and perhaps should, given the high fees - save the fees to increase your \"personal runway\" instead) drop out after the first 12-18 months there, as you'll have gotten most of the value at that point.\"\n\nI'm currently a freshman at UCSD interested in starting companies. What value do you get from Stanford in these 12-18 months. Is it possible for me to get the same value here? If it is, how can I go about getting that value?",

Go through it as fast as possible until you get to a \"project suggestion\" - and if you agree that the suggested project is highly valuable, then go and do that project, and return once done.\n\n2. Go through it all as fast as possible, don't stop at suggested projects, and then come back and do the suggested projects that you believe are valuable (if you believe a project isn't valuable, make sure you question your rationality - why do you think it's not valuable? what evidence do you have? because you may be likely to skip the ones that you most need.)\n\nThe danger with #2 is that you won't remember/have the discipline to come back and do the projects.\n\nBut either way can work.",

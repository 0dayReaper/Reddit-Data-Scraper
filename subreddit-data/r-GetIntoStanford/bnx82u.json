    "postText": "UC Berkeley has a somewhat similar culture to Stanford and they are very nearby each other. However, they also have their differences. Sorry if this was addressed before, but:\n\n1. Any specific advice for Berkeley students?\n2. How might UC Berkeley differ from Stanford, as far as making a big impact?\n3. Is there any advice here that *shouldn't* be taken by Berkeley students?\n4. Is it worth even attempting to transferring to Stanford (or a similar school)?",

            "comment": "I am someone who went through freshman year and read the articles, course, and these threads, taking rigorous notes. Pretty much everything is relevant besides the Stanford courses and specific dorm things. A few things I would do differently than what the guide suggested:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- join selective clubs or groups. berkeley is massive and it is much harder to find the ambitious and smart kids. there may be another route but the organizations (being ultra competitive) are a natural filter. i do agree with the advice to avoid freshman fomo though: don't be afraid to drop them though. it's hard to drop them, but they take a LOT of time that you could be spending elsewhere. i dropped the ones i didn't care about by the time i made all the friends in it and got the value i wanted. take his advice and be aggressive with choosing who you will be living with next year.\n\n\\- do NOT take the hardest courseload you can imagine first semester (or year). freshman year is pretty special in that you will meet a large portion of your friends and people you know. being buried in coursework is not the play even if you might graduate early or get another major in. i would take the intro course (61a, 61b) that everyone else is in but take it easier on the other courses. that way, you can meet a lot of the other smart freshman and spend time with other ambitious people.\n\n\\- help others. this wasn't mentioned, but berkeley's environment can become very toxic and competitive. the gains you get from helping friends will far outweigh the slightly higher curve you receive in the long run. berkeley's grades matter a lot more than stanford's (considering it'd be difficult to get below a B at stanford), so please don't disregard your grades (but also a 4.0 is really a waste of your time).  \nfeel free to pm me  \n\n\n  \n\n\nf\n\ndw",

            "comment": "1. Meet Stanford students, seriously! Kairos can be good for that I think. But you don't need a group, you can just do it randomly. Spend time with Stanford students on Stanford campus every month or so perhaps. Then you'll get a lot of the Stanford network value too. [I'm assuming you're interested in startups]\n\n2. Nothing comes to mind that's majorly different\n\n3. I'm not sure!\n\n4. Very hard to say. Berkeley is pretty good for startups. Spend time in SF, too. Meet people in SF and in the broader startup scene.",

Speaking of this, what exactly is Kairos? If not I will try my best to get there, but for sure it's easier for me to go places if I have a consistent reason to.",

I definitely can do that kind of cold contacting, but I meant *with* groups. But, now that I think about it, I bet befriending a Stanford student would lead to being invited to Stanford only things, whereas doing group events might lead be less valuable and less exclusive? Or am I wrong about that (if so any group events suggestions again? lol)",

    "postText": "Source? I got in!\n\nThe feedback/help here was so good. Read both AMAs in the sidebar and go through the guide on getting in on Medium as well. From this feedback I cut all the bullshit (so stuff that wasn't authentic / was forced to do by school / didn't care for) and just talked about why the things I love doing matter the world to me and how they connect with my life goals.\n\nI think this advice could have easily been the difference between my acceptance and rejection. Also, there's a lot of general self-betterment and life feedback/advice here and that's obviously a great thing.\n\nFor anyone applying RD or in future years, I highly encourage you to read the how to get into Stanford guide by the moderator of this sub: https://stanfordguide.org/how-to-get-into-stanford-6c8ebf1b6921\n\nInteract and ask questions here as well. I did that and it definitely helped!",

To point to any particular thread or comment would be fairly narrow I think, as there's no single way to get into Stanford, and nor is there a magic formula that will work every time.\n\nMy goal was to get to know the school as intimately as possible - therefore, I could structure my application to best mould my achievements to what they were looking for.\n\nIf you're looking to apply to Stanford, I'd start this information gathering as soon as possible.  I was lucky enough to already be familiar with the school through the businesses that I'd run, but for most they won't know it very well at all.  Read every post here, read r/Applyingtocollege, and read (*gulp*) College Confidential.  With enough information you'll get a much better idea of the school, and therefore how to apply.\n\nIf you need anything else, PM me.",

Let's say Harvard, MIT, USC, Berkeley, Columbia, Yale, Princeton, etc.? I'm referring mainly to entrepreneurship, but I guess in a way I would like an answer in the general sense as well.\n\nAlso, do you believe that some people are just born smarter and more talented than others? Is it something that is a product of the resources you grew up with and how you were raised? Is being a genius (or Zuckerberg, Jobs, Gates, Musk, etc.) something that can be developed throughout college? Are some people just not born good enough or is it just the motivation and thirst for knowledge that separates these people from others?\n\nI know this may be a little off topic and even uncalled for, but I've been thinking about it a lot through the college application process, especially after seeing all the amazing things some people have done (like build nuclear reactors or start million dollar businesses) as just high schoolers.",

For other things (i.e. non entrepreneurship), it's more equivalent.\n\nAlso MIT specifically might be better if you specifically want to build things related to hardware/electronics, seems like they have more capable students for that stuff.\n\nAlmost every single top VC firm has an office a few miles from Stanford's campus.\n\nCompare the number of billion dollar startup founders or investors a) from stanford and b) in the bay area vs elsewhere.\n\nBerkeley's network is probably pretty great also, especially for the students at Berkeley that take the time to invest a little bit in the San Francisco and Stanford networks both of which are close by.\n\nYes some people are born smarter, AND it's a product of the resources. It seems unlikely you can massively raise your IQ in college. The only things I've read that might point to increasing IQ are 1) there are some interesting studies on psychedelic drugs leading to an increase in the openness personality score, which if i remember correctly is the only personality trait that correlates with IQ 2) reading more books to become wiser may help, though not really sure on that.\n\nAre some people born not good enough? Depends on for what. Also even if some people are not born good enough, many people *are* born good enough, I think.\n\nBasically, the tl;dr is:\n\n- Some large number of people have the raw potential in terms of IQ and other things\n\n- Some smaller number have the IQ + motivation + desire potential (unclear to me how much motivation and determination is a product of environment vs genes, I don't know but would love to learn the answer to this)\n\n- Some smaller number again has the IQ, motivation, determination, and is lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time (though this is getting easier over time thanks to the internet, now if you're born first world in America say top 66-percentile you probably have enough mobility to get somewhere interesting with enough determination and IQ, though the bar is probably a little higher)",

How much could that impact my application?",

Just put relevant stuff not crap like what your favorite color is.\n\nAlso don't be afraid to write a few sentences in additional information. I had mine as a resume and then elaborated a bit on certain projects and why they mean a lot to me / why they are/were important to me in prose. Obviously don't overdo it. If this maker aspect is not represented anywhere else in your application that's gonna be important. Otherwise they just see some building + coding stuff in your ad info and nowhere else without any form of personal statement about it and they're left wondering -- why did this person do it / what did they learn from it / etc and it becomes forgetful.\n\nGood luck!!",

I'm worried they'll think I'm lying so if there's somewhere to show proof I'd definitely do it (although idk how experienced adcoms are with evaluating different projects). For one of my ECs I programmed bots to do things that helped me earn money. It's by no means an \"official\" extracurricular activity, but I'd like to talk about it. Also, it involves a decent sum of money involving non-tangible items, so at first it might not seem possible to the average person. I'm planning on writing one of my essays on it (although not the Common App), but am wondering if it's necessary to submit proof as well in this case. I'll be talking about why it matters to me and what the experience has taught me.",

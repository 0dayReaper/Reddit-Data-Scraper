    "postText": "I got deferred by Stanford, and I\u2019m confused as to what it means. Every school, especially Stanford, has a very unique deferral philosophy. I\u2019m also interested in knowing how Stanford committee decisions work - what does it mean that my AO was fighting for me at the conference table, and who all has to agree for an acceptance? \n\nThis all feels very unusual, since acceptance/rejection have clear emotional conjugates (happy/sad), but I\u2019m struggling to know how to react to a deferral. \n\nI live in a relatively small state/city, and as of now I don\u2019t think anyone was accepted near me. There was a girl in my city, who went to a different high school and had a lot of legacy and family donations, but she also got deferred. A few of my friends have also been rejected.\n\nI\u2019d be interested in seeing what you all think about my situation. Grades have never really been a problem, I did get one B+ freshman year in a math class (Pre-Cal), and I am a potential SymSys major. But since then my grades have all been A\u2019s. I\u2019ve been taking a really heavy course load this semester, and one of my classes is Multivariable Calc at the local University, so it could be the same they want to check my grades at mid-year. I\u2019ve also been thinking that maybe they want to compare me to the rest of our state since we\u2019re so small. I\u2019m just trying to get into the heads of the AO\u2019s so I can improve my update in the potential holes of my application.\n\nThanks! This sub has been helpful.",

            "comment": "Deferral is really good for Stanford!  Here is an article to put numbers into perspective: https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/01/24/early-programs-not-created-equal/\n\n&gt; \"NOT ALL DEFERRALS ARE CREATED EQUAL\n&gt; The largest disparity between Stanford, Princeton, Harvard and Yale existed with regards to the percentage of students deferred and rejected. Early applicants to Harvard, Princeton and Yale were significantly more likely to be deferred than rejected, with deferral rates of 68.1 percent, 78.9 percent, and 57.6 percent respectively. Stanford, however, only deferred 8.5 percent of early applicants. While Princeton and Harvard rejected 1.3 and 7.8 percent of early applicants, respectively, and Yale rejected 25.8 percent of applicants, Stanford rejected 80.7 percent of their applicants.\n&gt; Taylor said these differences are likely reflective of the volume of applications received by each of these schools.\n&gt; \u201cIn the early rounds, Stanford just likes to get kids off the hook,\u201d she said. \u201cThey know in the regular round, they\u2019re going to have so many applications that they just won\u2019t want to go back to see anyone who doesn\u2019t have an absolutely stellar application.\u201d\nHughes said he tells students deferred by Stanford that a deferral is a very good sign, because the school is signifying its willingness to closely reexamine the applicant in the spring. He added that at a school such as Princeton, deferred applicants could not infer anything from their decision. But a rejection from Princeton as an early applicant, on the other hand, is a strong indicator that the student is likely aiming too high with his or her college choices, Hughes said.\"\"\n\nPersonally, I was deferred last year REA. I was actually pretty happy about it because I knew about these statistics. So I kept up my grades for senior year first semester and I continued doing my extra curriculars (A lot of my friends stopped during senior year because of senioritis). They send you a form to fill out for any updates and I spent lots of time writing those (even though the word counts for the questions they asked were pretty small). It worked out for me!\n\nGood luck! You can do this :) \n\n",

                    "comment": "Hey, question about your update form. Did you try to answer the prompt 100% or did you try to be a little creative in it? There's not much room for creativity IMO but I'm scared that the big thing that held me back was that my writing could've improved (and I would say it has significantly since then... practicing with more essays really helped). I've already done the work to keep my grades up, I've improved my ECs, and I think I'm going to send in another LoR since I didn't send in my optional one. So from my perspective, I feel like I've done everything but add on to my writing. Do you think it would be risky to try to show some creativity in those questions?",

There's no obvious word limits that are shown so I assumed you could fit a lot in, but I guess that's not really a choice if it was 100 last year. But either way, I guess I'll try to see what I can fit in there. Thanks!",

    "postText": "The following is text from the application website:\n\n\"We will fully consider for admission any student that applies with an undergraduate engineering degree and/or BS degree. The program no longer accepts students with a background in Art. We do not have the resources necessary to respond to inquiries that ask if a particular degree is equivalent to a B.S. or other undergraduate engineering degree. To answer this question yourself, please consult with the institution that granted the degree and attach official documentation from the institution supporting that your degree is a B. S. equivalent under the Supplemental Materials section of your online application.\nPlease see the FAQ for more information.\"\n\nI have a degree in business and not engineering. All things equal, do I have a decent chance of acceptance into this program? Are there alternatives I should consider instead?",

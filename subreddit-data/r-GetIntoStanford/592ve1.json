    "postText": "I know admissions officers are looking for the type of student you are in the classroom and want to hear it from an outside source. Besides using specific examples to back up the claims made in the letter, is there anything else that makes for a good letter of recommendation letter? I asked one of my teachers to write me a letter of recommendation and he was asking if there were any resources he could review to see what makes a really good LoR besides the general tips. Thank you.",

    "postText": "Hi I'm sorry if I make spelling mistakes or something, I'm really anxious right now. \n\nI'm a junior who really loves Stanford, and I feel like I'm running out of time. I'm trying my best to get good grades and take advantage of opportunities, but no matter what I do I feel like it's never even close to enough. And this can be frustrating because I don't know what I'm lacking. \n\nI feel like it's not intelligence or something. I don't think that is much much of an indicator anyway, but I have taken multiple IQ tests in the past and they turned out pretty good. I *am* ambitious. I *do* feel that I am very similar in character to the kind of people who go to Stanford - that's why I love it so much.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong, then? What do I get these at best average scores and don't have anything to show yet? Everyone on here is a world champion at something. I have virtually no EC's. I'm midly interested about a few topics, but I don't have a Passion^TM . The best thing about my future application might be my SAT because it is in the range and I'm pretty confident I can raise it to Stanford-worthy levels, but even that is uncertain / not very important in admissions. \n\nI know I should have abandoned the idea of going to Stanford a long time ago, considering how all of you guys have perfect applications and the vast majority still don't get in. But I love it so much and I do feel like I would fit in. So what should I do differently? I also have really bad mood swings and depressive episodes sometimes that pretty much halt all productivity. Do I just have a shitty personality and work ethic? Please help a gal out. Any kind of help/tips would be appreciated.\n\nwow I'm sorry I don't know why I always write entire novels when I post something.\n\nTl;dr: I'm a junior who tries her best to be an impressive student but doesn't get any results comparable to what other people achieve and would like to know your guys's secret",

What's your issue? What's causing the scores to be low?\n\nYou have no ECs - what do you do with your spare time? \n\nCould it be work ethic - possibly. Check out this: https://www.reddit.com/r/GetIntoStanford/comments/7rcr9h/how_many_of_these_6_questions_would_you_answer_in/\n\nWhat should you do differently -- first check out the above notes, and then afterwords, basically the FAQ post should be your bible\n\nSide note: Analyze (and question/stress test) your goals. Why do you want to go to stanford? what makes you sure? is your opinion believable? why? see: https://medium.com/@james_aka_yale/the-5-step-process-to-get-what-you-want-out-of-life-572b6aab0224 and https://80000hours.org/career-decision/article/ (you can apply the same article to college choice instead of career choice)",

I very rarely have any free time because of hw, and when I do, I tend to procastinate and watch Netflix or something. When I'm more productive I draw or try to learn languages. I know both of those could be valid EC's but I've I've got so little time that my progress in both areas is painfully slow and thus not very impressive. I also used to code but I have have no time for it now.\n\nI know you're supposed to develope a \"spike\" and do interesting things, but I don't have an idea as to what my spike could be and how I could develop it in such little time. :(",

But you need to be able to be in the better environment for most of your time if you want to be productive for most of your time.\n\nAnd regarding developing a spike -- it takes a long time. Generally, best done through lots of self reflection, combined with \"following your curiosities/interests.\"\n\nGiven you limited amount of time, maybe frame it as what can I guarantee achieving if I put in the hours. Some suggestions:\n\n- if you picked a skill and put in the hours, you could almost guarantee you get a lot better at it, especially if you follow the rules of \"deliberate practice\"\n\n- if you spend lots of hours on self reflection, you could almost guarantee you'll know yourself better and be able to be more thoughtful\n\netc",

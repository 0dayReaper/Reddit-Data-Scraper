    "postText": "**Admissions questions**\n\nMake sure:\n\n- You've read this guide: https://stanfordguide.org/how-to-get-into-stanford-6c8ebf1b6921. If you want to get into Stanford it would be a substantial mistake to not thoroughly follow the essay writing process from this guide.\n\n- You've read this book: \"How to be a High School Superstar\"\n\n- You've watched [all of these videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetIntoStanford/comments/5oxzpz/stanford_applicant_case_study_videos/)\n\n- You've watched [this video with Martin Walsh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8duppSmEvw) and [this video with Rick Shaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRTcztFl1Jk), thanks PowerLemons\n\n- If you're not familiar with the college application process, you've read through [the Khan Academy Guide](https://www.khanacademy.org/college-careers-more/college-admissions/applying-to-college), thanks PowerLemons\n\n- Optional but recommended: You've read this [career guide by 80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/)\n\nMost of the advice I give is contained in those two things. If you have another question that cannot be answered with high confidence with a few minutes of Googling, feel free to post a thread on this subreddit, and type my username like so: \"/u/129183-stan-ps\" to tag me in the thread so that I get a notification - I generally reply faster if you do that.\n\n**FAQ**\n\nIs Stanford worth it? If you're interested in starting companies, yes. But you could (and perhaps should, given the high fees - save the fees to increase your \"personal runway\" instead) drop out after the first 12-18 months there, as you'll have gotten most of the value at that point.\n\nHow much time should I spend on my essays? I was pretty lazy with this. In hindsight, I think it's worth spending the equivalent of ~2-3 weeks full time outlining the essays / discovering topics to write about (follow the advice in the stanford guide post), and then ~1-2 days full time writing out the essays. You should put more time into the topic selection process than the refinement process.\n\n**Reviewing essays**\n\nI am not willing to review essays or tell you how to structure/format them. This is because I don't have any unique skills that would make me good at reviewing essays. The best thing to do is use a process that generates you some data so you know what works best in your specific situation. Following the process below with 10-15 random adults will be far more useful than me reading them. Do not message me and ask me to review your essays, thanks.\n\n**My strong suggestion is to follow the advice under \"What process should I use for writing essays?\" in this guide: https://stanfordguide.org/how-to-get-into-stanford-6c8ebf1b6921**\n\nThe general public is not clueless - people can generally tell when someone is impressive, especially when you give them well-selected criteria and tell them to rank them on those criteria.\n\n**Mentoring course for highly ambitious / capable people: on being more successful, and happier**\n\nIt is for you \u201cIf you want to make as much wealth as Bill Gates, and be as satisfied as the Dalai Lama.\u201d\n\nI offered mentoring - the interest was too strong, so I turned it into a course with resources instead.\n\nSee this https://www.reddit.com/r/GetIntoStanford/comments/71uzck/someone_asked_me_what_they_should_do_to_be_more/ to get a taste of what the content is like.\n\nSee here for the course information and application: https://stanfordguide.org/stanford-mentoring-ebedc0e566f8\n\n**Other questions?**\n\nPlease post them below. PMs will only be answered if they contain extremely private information where you couldn't make a throwaway reddit account and ask the question on the throwaway account.\n\n**Can I PM you a question?**\n\nNo. I'm happy to answer your question **if** you post it as a thread in this subreddit and tag my username, or as a reply to this thread - I want everyone to be able to benefit from the answer, not just one person. \n\nPMs will only be answered if they contain extremely private information where you couldn't make a throwaway reddit account and ask the question on the throwaway account. Ask yourself - if I made a throwaway account, what would the downside or risk be of me posting about this? I haven't yet seen a scenario where the question cannot be posted publicly, either with or without a throwaway account.",

That puts you *roughly* at the top 50% of scores for **admitted** applicants. Beyond that it's not worth re-taking in my opinion, unless you believe with minimal effort you can score 1580+. Otherwise, the opportunity cost of your effort makes it not worth it, and you're better spending time improving other areas of your application, like your essays, which are very important.\n\nSources: https://admission.stanford.edu/apply/selection/profile.html, https://blog.prepscholar.com/sat-percentiles-and-score-rankings",

            "comment": "Q: Is Stanford worth it?\n\nA: If your goal is to be one of the most impactful people in the world, then yes, I believe it is, and I think it's probably the best school to go to (above Oxford, MIT, Yale, etc) - though I'm sure there are cases where other schools would be more suited.\n\nIf your goal is just to get a job working at a big tech company in software engineering or something like this, it's probably not worth it unless you get free tuition. See this post, I generally agree with it: https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/74dj9s/top_schools_are_not_as_special_as_you_think/\n\nAlso, I highly recommend this: http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21646220-it-depends-what-you-study-not-where and http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/03/daily-chart-2 -- if you're optimizing for a well-paying job, it's more about what you study, not where.",

                    "comment": "&gt; Hey! I just stumbled upon your AMAs from 2 years ago, it's 11:30 at night and I should probably sleep, but I just wanted to get a quick idea of where I stand, since I saw somewhere that you were happy to answer personal chance questions via PM. I'm from a small city/town. We had a huge fire about a month ago and 3500 houses burned down here...a lot of my friends lost their house, I was lucky, but at my school an estimated 19% of kids lost their house. Enough about the background; now about myself. I'm a junior, and want to take CS at a major uni like Stanford, MIT, Caltech etc. These are some quick stats about me: SAT: I've practiced a lot, and have been getting 1550-1590 range on the last few practice tests. Aiming for a 1600. Subject tests: 740 on Chem, idk if I'll send that/retake or what. Need to take more sometime this year. PSAT, I got 1470 on this year's test but am not a US citizen so am not eligible for Nat. Merit anyways. AP classes: I took 2 last year (Euro and Chem), 5s on both and am taking 4 this year. GPA and rank: 4.0 UW, 4.69 W. Ranked 7 out of 408 (only because I took regular instead of hon. spanish freshman year) EC: I'm working on a project with a local elementary school that will bring Virtual Reality to classrooms to aid with learning. Currently in the process of collecting donations, and am still looking for some large corporation to help me out and donate the 30+ smartphones I need for it to happen. I have 80 community hours currently, will get 100+ possibly 200. Working with the parents club which is 501 nonprofit, idk if that matters. Additionally, I have an app idea which I think would be good, but haven't started on it yet. I don't really know how to code in Swift (I did know Objective-C 3-4 years ago but forgot it mostly) and will need to spend a lot of time for it to happen. Other than that, not much. I'm in Academic Decathlon...that's about it. Recs: Haven't thought about it much. My AP Lang teacher would give a good rec, AP Chem teacher from sophomore year could be good (I've heard sophomore teacher recs aren't recommended; is this true?), my math teacher's would be eh..the elementary school principal where I'm doing VR could give me a good one, she was my 6th grade teacher. I guess where I'm going with this is: Should I include the whole fire situation in my essays or story or anything? How would it impact the app? Would I get any benefit from doing that? Where do I stand right now for admission, granting I get a 1600 or close to it on the SAT? What factors can I improve? Do my EC's sound good and illustrate a deep love for programming/CS/techy stuff? Because I do genuinely have a love for tech. I do tons of worthless little \"hacks\" and stuff in my free time too, like modding iOS games via jailbreak and creating bots that run on games to level me up for fun. Idk if I should include all that in the application form though. Just any general advice. Thank you so much, I know this is a really long PM and you might not want to read it, but I would greatly appreciate it if you gave me tips on how to improve and chanced me for Stanford, MIT etc. Thanks again!\n\nSophomore teacher recs may be worse than a later teacher rec all things equal, *but* I'd definitely prioritize whoever would write the more glowing letter, not the teacher year\n\n&gt; Should I include the whole fire situation in my essays or story or anything? How would it impact the app? Would I get any benefit from doing that?\n\nif and only if you have significant things to say about it / it has genuinely influenced you etc\n\n&gt; Where do I stand right now for admission, granting I get a 1600 or close to it on the SAT? \n\nDecent, but it'll hinge on whether you have the \"wow factor\" / whether you're \"so good they can't ignore you\" -- which will mostly come from what you talk about in essays and to some degree what the recs show about you\n\n&gt; What factors can I improve? \n\nread all of the linked resources in this FAQ post\n\n&gt; Do my EC's sound good and illustrate a deep love for programming/CS/techy stuff?\n\nI'd say they illustrate some love, but it wouldn't stand out as impressive amongst stanford acceptees I know\n\n&gt; Because I do genuinely have a love for tech. I do tons of worthless little \"hacks\" and stuff in my free time too, like modding iOS games via jailbreak and creating bots that run on games to level me up for fun. Idk if I should include all that in the application form though. \n\nFollow the process in the how to get into stanford post on stanfordguide. i bet that talking about things like this will serve you better than talking about the other things, which seem more like things that are done to get into school, and not things done out of genuine interest.\n\nif someone reads it and thinks you're genuinely interested in things (test this with random people that you don't know reading your essays! follow the process), then that will go a long way.\n\n&gt; Just any general advice. Thank you so much, I know this is a really long PM and you might not want to read it, but I would greatly appreciate it if you gave me tips on how to improve and chanced me for Stanford, MIT etc. Thanks again!\n\nSeems like good potential but only if you're thorough with your process of choosing what to write about and what to say about it in your essays/app. Read all of the links in the OP FAQ, and follow the process on stanfordguide.org 'how to get into stanford' post, and don't skip any steps. You can substantially increase your odds.",

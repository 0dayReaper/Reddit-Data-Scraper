    "postText": "I'm a very practical and science-based person. I'm an atheist, but I do things like tarot cards and believe in things like chakras and alignment and stuff. I know in general you shouldn't talk about religion, but is this something worth putting in the \"letter to your roommate\" supplement? I only ask because my friends are always taken by surprise when they find out I do things like that and I think it represents a more dynamic version of myself. I think it might be beneficial because I'm applying to Chem E and I want to show that I have more sides to my personality than just the analytical one.",

            "comment": "It is great to include your personality and character, since the roommate essay is about your identity. But, I still think that religion is a bit touchy subject, like you never know who is admissions officers and how he/she will view that topic. If you word it well, it is worth to put in. I hope the advice was useful.\ud83e\udd2a",

    "postText": "I'm looking at some admitsee profiles, and the essays they wrote are very good quality writing. They use many literary devices and make it sound poetic. They also write in a story like fashion. \n\nHowever, when I look at my essay I feel like its more plain and also it kind of sounds like I am bragging. On the Stanford guide, it says that it is good to write an essay with good content, but not great writing. However, after looking at the profiles, I think the admissions office evaluates how well you write. \n\nWhat should I do? ",

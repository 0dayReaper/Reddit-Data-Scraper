Most of the questions won't be relevant.\n\nThat said, the getting into stanford guide should still be pretty relevant. https://stanfordguide.org/how-to-get-into-stanford-6c8ebf1b6921\n\nThough I imagine the weightings are somewhat different for grad admissions.\n\nEssentially, wherever you have to demonstrate you are an awesome person, the Stanford guide post above will be very helpful.\n\nFor other areas, seek other information.",

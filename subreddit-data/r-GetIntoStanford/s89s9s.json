    "postText": "Hello everyone! I'm a low-income Vietnamese Canadian in grade 10. Currently, my GPA is a 4.0 weighted (based on the SU6 system), since I go to a small public school that is unable to offer any honours, or advance placement courses. Next year, I plan to commute further to a public school that offers the IB diploma program. My extracurriculars are environmental activism/volunteering (I'm a social-media coordinator for a local organization), student council grade rep, math contests, and computing contests. I would like to major in computer science, or electrical engineering. I'm concerned that my need for financial aid may affect my chances greatly, since Stanford is a need-aware school. Any responses are much appreciated! If you want any additional information, I'd be happy to answer. (I've also read 'How To Be A High-School Superstar' by Cal Newport)",

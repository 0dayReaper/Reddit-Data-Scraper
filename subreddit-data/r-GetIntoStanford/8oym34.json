And I think your idea to look for people who've done it is a good one. If you really wanted to hustle, you could fly to Stanford for the weekend, go to Tressider Union, and ask students if they know any transfers that you can interview for advice. Awkward? Probably. Useful? Yes!",

Stanford's transfers mostly consist of recruited/traded athletes and people who serve(d) in the military. If your dream is a top school, don't lose hope because I know a community college student who transferred to Columbia. If you are from CA, CSUs and UCs are great options to transfer to but there is also USC which accepts many transfers. Rejection sucks and I wanted to do cc to reapply for my dream school even though I got into Berkeley, but someone once explained it to me that college admissions is like a relationship... if they reject you once, they don't want you and you should go somewhere that does. At the end of the day, making the most out of any undergraduate experience is what matters because you got a degree! Plus. there's always Grad School at Stanford!",

Which made it hard for me to keep track of school, scholarships, testing, college applications, working and caring for my 2 disabled siblings. I am also the only one who has worked in my family since 2016. We are also very poor with social security benefits being the greatest income. I can't afford community college either, only reason I'm going is because my  summer research  program  is a paying for it. Do you think I could fall in stanfords radar for extreanous circumstances?  That is if I do impressive things and get great GPA.",

I know community college students who while still at CC did research for Stanford/at Stanford. If you are a minority underrepresented in higher education and interested in meterology/geology/physical sciences there is a research program available but jesus I cannot think of the specific name even though I looked into it myself. Pretty sure there is also research opportunities there for any subject. I mean if you are really really wanting admission into Stanford why don't you contact admissions yourself and explain the situation and see what they recommend?",

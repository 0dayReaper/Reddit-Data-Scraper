            "comment": "1) most cog enhancers seem weak.\n\n2) if someone genuinely has ADHD (do a self report test online to see if a diagnosis is worth it) then meds seem likely helpful. Use the lowest dosage possible that still works.\n\n3) cognitive nootropics seem unlikely to make a noticeable difference at this point. Maybe bacopa helps a bit with memory (probably worth it if you're taking lots of tests).  But the point being that none of them will make a massive difference, as far as I'm aware\n\n4) modaf specifically seems ok. I guess maybe useful if you want help studying or working for super long hours.  ",

I'm currently in the process of writing my common app essay and would really appreciate it if I could run my ideas (bullet point form of my essay) by any Stanford accepted students!  My dream school is Stanford, and as an international student, I know that my chances of admission are very low and would like to give in my best shot.  Thank you so much in advance!",

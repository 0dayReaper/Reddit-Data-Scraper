    "postText": "Before I took the Math II and physics SAT subject tests in December 7, I selected Stanford among others to receive these scores as soon as they came out. Subject tests are optional for the Stanford application and currently the scores are pending so I don\u2019t think they have arrived at Stanford yet. I received a 730 in physics but a 680 in math II (apparently this is really bad as math II should be a piece of cake for someone with a strong math background like me). I would retake it but applications are due January and the next available exam is May. Now the scores are on their way. Since Stanford is subject test optional, will my 680 hurt my chances of getting in or will Stanford simply not care and move on to the rest of my application.\n\nTL:DR: I got 680 in math II and 730 in Physics, 1510 SAT, all three are on their way to Stanford. Should I cancel the 680 score send?",

Unfortunately, I called collegeboard this morning and they told me that they could not cancel any of these scores because they are already on their way to being sent. I guess I\u2019m stuck sending this score to all the colleges on my list. \n\nIsn\u2019t it funny how you CB doesn\u2019t let you cancel scores after you have actually seen them?",

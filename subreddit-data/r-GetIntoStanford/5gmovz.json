    "postText": "I feel like spending too much time on the Internet (especially but not limited to Reddit) has made me extremely impatient and information hungry. I used to be an avid reader and would acquire a lot of knowledge about different things I'm passionate about eg. app development through long books and YouTube lectures at a young age but now find myself trying to skim every possible body of text, watch each video in  2x speed, etc.\n\nIt's become extremely difficult for me to sit down with a book, nowadays. And with simpler things like reading a long article or watching a book I quickly become demotivated because I'm too impatient / want to acquire that information much much faster. It's tiring to slow myself down and just \"get lost\" in what I'm trying to consume. At the same time, this could be attributed to a poor attention span (which has recently become a pretty big issue for me in certain classes I find boring eg. Physics/Chinese?)\n\nRecently I've been trying to take more courses in AI and watch interviews with people in the startup tech space to gain more insight but my self-discipline has been at an all time low; it takes a lot of effort to simply hit play and even more to continue watching without continuous breaks. Is this a self-discipline problem (which, by the way, I lack like crazy but usually only when it comes to school work I find boring?)\n\nSo it seems like my main problem is not being able to slow down and just be more patient with things like lectures and books, but issues with self-discipline and concentrating also come into play. Generally, I am a very focused person; majority of the last 4 years of my life outside school have been devoted to building out + launching two main personal projects, but it feels like in the short-term I lack good concentration abilities.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm effectively conveying exactly what I mean by this. I wonder if anybody here can relate and give tips? It's starting to really frustrate me.\n\nSo, basically, how can I work on:\n\n- Digesting information more patiently which will help me with lectures + reading books\n- Self-discipline\n- Increasing attention span\n\nAnd do these play into each other somehow?",

Find things you can watch at 2x or skim read etc, and learn from those\n\n2. Decide that there are certain things that you really need to learn and you won't be able to do it at 2x\n\nPersonally, I'm a fan of option 1. It's what I do and it hasn't (yet, and to my knowledge) prevented me from learning things that I want to learn. I aggressively skim, skip boring sections, etc -- I just read the things that are interesting to me or have important knowledge that will be useful for me in the next 0-12 months in terms of what I build",

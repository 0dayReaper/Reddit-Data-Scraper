Read biographies of people who have done that or invested in those companies (e.g. books on early google, facebook, apple, oracle, salesforce, amazon, twitter, telsa/spacex, etc). Then you should read broadly to understand humanity. Read Sapiens, and then perhaps Homo Deus to understand more of the future. After you've read all of Paul Graham's essays on startups, read Zero to One next. It's a good compilation/summary of some important things. Also read/watch all of CS183B (Sam Altman/YC) and also CS184 (BSS). Other important/must read books for this goal: Poor Charlie's Almanack, Principles, The Outsiders (8 CEOs). See more resources for that here: https://stanfordguide.org/advice-for-ambitious-stanford-freshmen-interested-in-startups-79167994983#.cdujtn16i\n\nWant to build a $500k-10mm/year lifestyle business and not take funding? Read websites of people who have done that. e.g. seek out patio11, levelsio, etc.\n\nYou should read all of pmarchive.com, stuff in it is relevant for both categories",

    "postText": "Hey guys!  \nI'm a low-income international student from Russia applying to Stanford's Communication major Regular Decision. I have just finished my Common App essay draft, but I'm struggling to be concise. I'm \\~200 words over the word count right now :d  \nAnyway, I'm looking for a kind person *attending Stanford* who would help me out and read my essay! (can't afford essay editors haha... :((() I would love to hear feedback on how I presented myself, what could be changed, and if there are paragraphs where I can cut words down without losing precious info!  \nThank you in advance!",

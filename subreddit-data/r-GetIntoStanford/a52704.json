    "postText": "It seems like this place has mostly a tech entrepreneur audience, so I was wondering where else you guys are applying.\n\nFor me:\n\nUT Austin - Startup culture, good weather\n\nSanta Clara- Not the most prestigious, but great location for internships / meeting people with similar interests\n\nNorthwestern - The Garage is like an on-campus incubator.  Would be great to get some experience while working on a degree.\n\nGeorgia Tech - The thread curriculum where you get to choose a specific focus within CS (security, human interaction, systems, etc.) seems really valuable.  Haven't visited but heard it is a good location as well.\n\nAny other ones I'm missing?\n",

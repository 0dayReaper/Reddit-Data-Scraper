I\u2019m trying to find out whether reading summaries only of these books is good enough. \nAlso, are there any other resource recommendations you would advise, for example, resources about software development (like ruby on rails website and that book in your \u201cWhat to do after mentoring course post\u201d).",

What you can always do is read a summary, and then see if that hooks you into reading the full book. You can treat the summary like a preview for the book.\n\nBut for win bigly and psycho cybernetics i'd say *definitely* read the whole book",

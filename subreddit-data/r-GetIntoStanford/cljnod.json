    "postText": "Hi, I am a student from Malaysia that is currently studying a comp sci degree in Australia after I transferred from my local uni back there. I did a bit of digging on Stanford's grad website and I saw that they required GRE and TOEFL test scores on the general information website, but once I get to the grad admissions website for international applicants I did not see the GRE test(s) being required, but only minimum level of english proficiency (TOEFL) and your academic records from every postsecondary institution that I have attended. Is there anyone in this subreddit that has applied for MS Computer Science at Stanford that could give me some advice ? Thanks !",

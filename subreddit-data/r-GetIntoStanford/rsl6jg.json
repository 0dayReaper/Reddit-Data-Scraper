    "postText": "So I am a junior and have always seen Stanford as something out of reach for me... but I recently have been thinking more about it and now hope to apply next year. I was wondering if you guys think I might have a shot:\n\nSo I have lived overseas in Japan with military parents, so I speak some Japanese but not a lot. I have not taken SAT/ACT yet but without studying I got 1400 on the PSAT so I feel as though with a month or so review I could get a 1500+ on the SAT... though I do not know much about the ACT. When I apply these will most likely be my stats: I should graduate around a 4.3 GPA. I play piano, guitar, and cello and am pretty good at art. I have two years of NHS and four years of Japanese NHS. I have four years of tech club (one year VP and one year treasurer) and engineering club (two years president). I have participated in two years of a science competition, and went to nationals one year (this year I do not know how I will do, but am confident in nationals again). I founded a branch of an international robotics competition at my school and we will be sending a team out of country to compete after our regional competition. We also bring middle schoolers over to almost mentor them in teams for the competition. I have done cross country and track throughout high school. I am also secretary of my student council and have been sense I was a sophomore. What do you guys think?",

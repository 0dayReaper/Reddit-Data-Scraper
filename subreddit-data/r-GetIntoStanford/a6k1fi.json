    "postText": "sorry for the awkward title but basically i have a somewhat big (10k+) instagram on niche social justice/pop culture. I wanted to hear your thoughts if this is worth taking out some of my other more standard ecs and putting this in since im not sure if it's even valuable. i know this isn't that impressive but perhaps compared to my other ecs it might be? i would take out either my varsity sport or some school leadership.\n\ni guess the general question is that are unorthodox ecs more valuable than standard school ones at all? especially if there's no direct value from my account yet? \n\n\nextra info:\n-actually probably won't include for stanford since it's not related to my applying major but might for other schools (econ+ poli sci) ",

            "comment": "Some schools, including Stanford, will ask for the websites you frequent or social media you use. That would be a good place to mention this. If it\u2019s a meaningful experience you could even turn this into a decent essay!\n\nOtherwise you could simply list this on your activities. No harm in it (as long as you are specific about the content!)",

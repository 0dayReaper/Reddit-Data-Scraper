    "postText": "Okay so i'm going to give as much information as possible:\n\nI am 24, graduated with a neuroscience degree and a minor in music. My average overall was about a 76 (not sure what GPA that would be). I went to a school that is known well in Canada for medicine however once I learned about the world of computer science my end goals changed dramatically. \n\nI graduated and enrolled in the computer science program at the same university. I will have completed the first year requirements (calc 1001 and 1001b, as well as both first year comp sci courses, and a 2nd year course). My average is a 92. \n\nBeing 24, having never lived away from home, my heart is set on leaving for a more prestigious school especially those in the U.S like Stanford. My only focus on life is my career and that is it and hence a better school with better connections (e.g. stanford + silicon valley) would help shape my career. \n\nthe questions i have are as follows:\n\nBeing a Canadian student how do I fund my tuition, I assume I would be considered what is know in Canada as an \"independent\" i.e. someone who's financial needs are not influenced by how much my parents make (for the record, incase its somehow relevant,  its over 160k/year). \n\nHow in the hell do i apply? Given that I have a degree, I know some schools (e.g. Harvard) do not allow transfer students with degrees, therefore, what are my options here? Stanford's website was somewhat helpful but not enough \n\nDo my high school marks matter at all and will my previous school marks matter (i.e. neuroscience)?\n\n\nHuge thanks in advance!\n",

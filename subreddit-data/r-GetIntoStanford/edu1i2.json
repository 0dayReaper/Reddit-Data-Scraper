    "postText": "Hey guys, I haven't applied to Stanford yet but there's this hypothetical situation that's been bugging me. Suppose I get into Stanford without applying for aid, and around July I get my green card. Am I eligible for aid then? Is it guaranteed? Because my family definitely needs help with financing.  \nHas anyone had the same situation before? I would love it if you could share it with me.",

This is taken directly from their website \"International students who do not request consideration for financial aid at the time they apply for admission will not be eligible to apply for aid at Stanford throughout their undergraduate years.\n\nHowever, if your citizenship status changes during the time you are enrolled as an undergraduate, and you become eligible for federal student aid, you may also be considered for need-based scholarship funds starting in the quarter during which your citizenship status changes.\"\n\nLink: [https://financialaid.stanford.edu/undergrad/how/international.html](https://financialaid.stanford.edu/undergrad/how/international.html)",

There would be another plethora of problems like: \nif that actually happens, how would I fill out the statement of finance. Billing alone would be fine since Stanford bills monthly of course.\nAnd since I wouldn't know how to bill and wouldn't know when my green card arrives, there would be a problem of getting a student visa in the meanwhile too.",

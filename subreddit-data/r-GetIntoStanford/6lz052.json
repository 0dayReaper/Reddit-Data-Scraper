    "postText": "Hi! I have two intellectual vitality essays- one already written and one newer idea. I am a prospective applicant applying for Fall 2018, hopeful to be a Science Technology and Society (concentration public policy) or Political Science major and CompSci minor. Tell me which idea sounds most intriguing.\n\n1: My senior year honors information technology independent study project, where I research and apply classic and modern philosophical principles to developments in artificial intelligence and technological innovation as a whole. I also discuss my love for discovering the unknown and bridging the gap between the humanities and sciences\n\n2: Discussing my experiences being a research intern in political science at a nearby university, and how I deepened my appreciation and knowledge about social policy, specifically educational policies. I want to tie in my background here to give context. I'm wondering if this should be my EC essay, but I've already written it (it's about debate).\n\nWhich one is better and why? If you need to read the one that's written, PM me",

            "comment": "I'm not sure that writing about something you were asked to do is going to be helpful.  Intellectual Vitality is about generating your own path and actively seeking out new intellectual stimulation, not an impressive take on a required piece of coursework.  You should try to think of something that's going to set you apart further - they're going to get a lot of essays about blending humanities and sciences, in particular.\n\nHave you ever been curious about something outside the classroom that you could write about?\nYou have a lot of time, so I'd reflect for a bit longer before settling on an idea.",

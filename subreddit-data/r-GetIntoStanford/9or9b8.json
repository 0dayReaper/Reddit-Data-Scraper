            "comment": "Agreed 100%. This worked for me much better. I originally asked someone for feedback with one because I was really emotionally attached to it and I thought refining it would be the best way to go. You\u2019re much better off coming up with a couple topics and writing at least 2, probably even more. Think of it like more trials = higher chance of success.\n\nEdit: just read article, excellent analogy.",

            "comment": "If you're only applying because your dad is encouraging you, then to be brutally honest you don't sound like the type of person Stanford hopes to admit.\n\nThat said, if you're being purely self-interested, of course you should apply, assuming your goals involve being successful in life. I'm struggling to answer this question because I'm confused. Why don't you want to apply? Because you don't think you'll get in or because you don't want to go to Stanford? If the former, then that's silly, it would be insane not to try (in my opinion), if the latter, why don't you want to go there?\n\nAnd to answer the title, legacy helps but not a ton. Unless your parents donate $10mm+ or are billionaires perhaps (even then, you still have to be someone Stanford wants, but that would be genuinely helpful for getting admitted), being a legacy won't be the reason you get accepted.",

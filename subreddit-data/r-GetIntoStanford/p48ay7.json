    "postText": "Hey there,\n\nI am a high school graduate from India and I plan to apply to universities in the US and Canada for admission in the Fall Admissions Session. My hope is to get into Stanford majoring in Materials Science. I have done research regarding cementitious materials at government facilities in my town during my sophomore and senior year. In my gap year, I am doing Computational Materials Research regarding Hydrophobic Collapse and it's Biological Effects at IIT Delhi(one of India's most prestigious institute for STEM fields). Also, I know Python, MATLAB, AutoCAD, and Wolfram Language which I am using to develop different projects in Materials Science. Can anyone tell me how much of a chance will I stand of getting into Stanford with this and 4.0 GPA, Tennis as extracurriculars and 1520 on SAT?  \nYour earnest and honest answers will be highly regarded.",

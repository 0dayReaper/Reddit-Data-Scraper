    "postText": "I studied a lot for the SAT, and I've got a pretty good score. I'm retaking one more time this May, and I'm fairly certain I can get in the 1550 range. \n\nHowever, my school had an in-school ACT that I had to take, and since I didn't prepare for it, I did okay on it, but not great for a school like Stanford.\n\nI read somewhere that I have to submit all tests from ACT and SAT to Stanford. On top of that, my ACT score is now listed on my transcript (and my SAT is not because my school is in the south and doesn't typically do SAT).\n\nI could take this summer to prepare for the ACT and do very well on it, but at the same time, I was planning on focusing on projects and ECs this summer. Should I attempt to study for the ACT and take it again?",

But I wouldn't invest a ton of time into it.",

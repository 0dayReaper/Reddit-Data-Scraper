But realistically either would be fine they're not going to be upset if you put it with the academic stuff. \n\n&gt; In the education section of the Common App, is there a specific order we should list our senior year classes?\n&gt; Most impressive to least impressive? All first semester than second semester? By subject in a certain order?\n\nDoesn't matter at all. If 10,000 people tweaked their order I don't think it would be the difference in an accept/reject for any of the 10,000. ",

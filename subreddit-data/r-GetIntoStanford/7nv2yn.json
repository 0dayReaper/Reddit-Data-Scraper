    "postText": "31 ACT, 710 Math 2. \nAs a prospective data science major (applied as a prospective mathematical and computational science major) , I tried to put myself as a funny, energetic, quirky, entrepreneurial and open minded individual. (0 pretentious bullshit.)\nWell, my grades are very very very good, and I have a rank 7 in my national maths olympiad(almost represented my country in the IMO) \nI ran my first company when I was in 9th grade. I had no intention \nto make money, but actually solve the problem I was tackling (related to the tourism industry). But, I sold the rights of my company to the country's largest travel bookin company. \ntoday, I use analytics to generate more revenues for small businesses, and I have almost 28000$ in revenues and little profit. (I invest everything back into those businesses) \n\nWhy I want to attend stanford? In my family, or society, everyone tends to only become an engineer or a doctor. I am an outcast. but more importantly, Stanford represents progress to me. It's a place where I can become independent and actually grow myself as an entrepreneur using data to empower people. \n\nBut everything that I write here, I don't think I was able to convey that in my application. They don't know that I am an outcast, my IV essay was kinda not interesting to read, and my why stanford 50 words essay was kinda generic. all of my other essays were personal, quirky, and funny. \nI have read 129183stanps's guide. I just need to know if i have a chance haha. Now I can't change my app but I will send you my essays if you can tell me if i conveyed myself truly. It's kind of reassurance :P",

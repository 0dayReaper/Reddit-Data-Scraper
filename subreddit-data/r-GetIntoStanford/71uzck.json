    "postText": "**What to do with your time:**\n\n&gt; \"I'm nearly at the end of finishing the course that you've very kindly set up. Please can you suggest next steps for me to complete? I'm specifically looking for projects to do, things to build, code, etc. I have around 10 hours of 'free time' a week I'm happy to devote into this. I see that you have a very strong understanding of a lot of things in general, (usually related to human success), and hence am requesting to know, out of curiosity, what I should do. ... If you'd like, I can provide more context about myself, but I am really keen to know your opinion on what projects I should undertake over the next four+ years.\"\n\nI think a good allocation/progression would be something like:\n\n- Spend 1-2 months focused on self reflection. Understand what you want. Do the self authoring suite https://www.selfauthoring.com/self-authoring-suite.html. buy and read this book: https://www.amazon.com/Change-Your-Story-Life-Transformation/dp/1844094642 and do the exercises. During this 1 month Try and identify all areas in your life where you have a \"scarcity mindset\" and shift into an \"abundance mindset\" (google it). Also during this month try and identify all areas in your life where you have set arbitrary upper limits - wherever there are things that you notice you don't allow yourself to believe you could achieve X. Then for those \"Xs\" ask if the laws of physics make \"X\" impossible, and if some human on earth could conceivably achieve X. Then realize that you could likely achieve X or make substantial progress, if you decided to. Keep going on this until you truly believe it, not just logically understand it.\n\n**Why:** Most people I see seem to flail around in life, and I believe in large part this is because they don't know much about themselves and what they want. Treat this as a really valuable investment into yourself and your future ability to achieve things -- the better you know yourself and your goals, the better your ability to achieve things will be. I believe this strongly, and I believe this has helped me and been a source of lasting advantage.\n\n- Spend 1 month optimizing your studies, to reduce your time spent on school/any other requirements while maintaining or increasing grades (remember, treat high school / chores / etc like a day job: http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html)\n\n- You can get more than 10 hours per week free. Use studying strategies from cal newport's books to reduce the time you spend on schoolwork while getting similar grades (e.g. https://smile.amazon.com/How-Become-Straight-Student-Unconventional/dp/0767922719/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1504231292&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=cal+newport, also this book looks good to learn about memory techniques, which you should do: https://smile.amazon.com/Unlimited-Memory-Advanced-Strategies-Productive-ebook/dp/B00I3QS1XQ/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1504231242&amp;sr=1-8). If you're in college, skip things that don't help you learn something that is the most important thing for you to learn or that doesn't contribute to a grade that you need. If you're in highschool and homework doesn't count towards your grade, you don't need to do it - if the teacher is being a hard ass about it and making homework count, get good grades, and then try and talk to them 1:1 and ask them to let you get out of the homework requirements.\n\n**Why:** To get more free time to spend on more interesting things.\n\n- Spend 1 month focused on addressing your insecurities and fears. Recognize that in most cases, the worst that can happen is temporary embarrassment, and the best that can happen is a lasting reduction in fears and increase in fulfillment. Also in the best case as well, a great thing that can happen is that you can short cut your goals -- e.g. many people want to achieve big goals because they fill a void, and if they instead fill the void first, then they can use their ambition to achieve even bigger things with more flexibility. \n\n**Why:** Similar to the self-reflection. People limit what they want to do because of their fears, or they set about doing things in very inefficient ways because they have arbitrary limiting beliefs due to insecurities or fears. It's extremely hard to do this and I don't yet have a specific set of instructions someone can follow to achieve it - but your goal should be to end up in a state where you truly believe that if you decided to do *anything* that *some* human is capable of, that *you* would be capable of it, should you *decide* to do it. (Barring anything limited by the laws of physics)\n\n- Spend 3 months focused on getting your income to $1000/month, through consulting. Probably the best thing would be to do some type of development consulting. There are resources on this in the forum. See also: https://www.amazon.com/Software-Engineers-Guide-Freelance-Consulting-ebook/dp/B01N1TTJFK/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=. Look at things like AngelList, Upwork, Toptal, etc. You don't need to get pro first and then start charging. Once you can build something, you can then start offering your services and learn on other people's dime. Also, if the client is shitty -- don't take them on. You don't need this money - you want it - and it's not worth it if you're working for someone who is rude or bad in some other way.\n\n**Why:** Getting to this level will prove to you that if you want/need, you could scale up to ~$3000/month, at which point you're capable of surviving on your own. Once you reach the point where you know that you'll never need to get a job out of necessity, you will become more free to pursue more ambitious plans, because you know that you have an excellent backup plan.\n\n- Now split your time between having fun, following your interests and curiosities (for you that may mean into certain technologies), continuing to make ~$1000/month, and some time just doing things that look impressive for college officers, as described in the book 'how to be a high school superstar' by cal newport\n\n**Why:** Fun because it's fun, following interests and curiosities because that's fun and leads to great returns, making the money for the reason described above (you can toggle your hours lower if you want), and the 'high school superstar' stuff because it could be a good investment into increasing your odds of being able to get into stanford\n\nI think it's probably better to do these as \"focused sprints\" where you focus on just one of them, as described above, for a given period, rather than mixing them all up and splitting your time, but I'm not sure. Either way may work.\n\nRead these notes I put together for some extra info https://quip.com/Hv5MAeqrAaoH, but the above version is better and more appropriate here \n\n&gt; \"Also, I believe its a bit ironic that I skipped the bit on what I want to achieve in life (given that I respect you a lot, and you consider a person's goals the most important), so I'd like to list my goal as  either :\"\n\n&gt; \"rising to a very very high position into a well established company and promoting innovation in this company\"\n\n&gt; \"or, making a company rise to a very high position, but more about advancing research into technology and applying this into the general benefit of humans, and simplifying peoples' lives. (preferred)\"\n\nThe following is a note that I wish someone had told me:\n\nI think earlier on, say for the next few years, it may be better to take your goals and identify the root/abstract desires beneath them. i.e. the parts that won't change. e.g. when I was younger, I had goals like \"make $x in recurring income\" -- but really want I wanted at an abstract level was \"have personal freedom so that I don't need to get a job to support myself.\" I believe goals are almost always better when *initially* defined at the root / most abstract.\n\ne.g. for many people, rising to a great position in a company, or helping a company rise and be successful -- the root/abstract goal here is perhaps some combination of: achieve respect from people you want respect from, prove to yourself that you can do it, achieve some power/influence over the world, gain wealth for freedom, something like this.\n\nOnce you've taken it to the abstract, identify the sub-component that you most want now, and then focus more on that.\n\n&gt; \"To get there, I feel like I need to meet more people like me who have similar aspirations. I visited a few universities over the summer and paid particular attention to what the general student body thinks like or aspires for. I found that three universities, MIT, Stanford and Harvard (coincidentally also top colleges) had a lot of this kind of mindset, but Stanford fits me the most because there are people there who just learn for the sake of learning, which I identify myself as (I like to add application of learning to this too). As a result, I feel like Stanford would be a good place for me to go to. \"\n\nNice. Good approach. I do think it's getting easier, and I hope/believe that by the time you go to university, it won't be as necessary. e.g. you could meet great people through the thiel fellowship, or simply even by just being in San Francisco, or by living near Stanford and meeting students.\n\nif I hadn't gotten into Stanford, in *hindsight* the right approach would've been to move to the bay area and make friends with these people.\n\nAlso Twitter seems to be great for networking -- I think the wrong approach to twitter networking is to use it like high school or like a party and try and become friends with the cool people -- and the right approach to twitter networking is to have conversations with the *non-famous* people who are willing to have conversations with \"nobodies\" (i.e. often the people who are willing to engage have &lt;5,000 followers, but not always, some like @naval are open to conversing with anyone and don't treat twitter like a popularity contest, which is refreshing to see), and *most importantly* to constantly share stuff that you come across during your \"following your curiosity\" time. This will allow you to connect with people across the world who are curious about the same stuff as you.\n\nI think/hope that over the next few years I'll be able to formalize this strategy more, and that Stanford will become less necessary. Stanford will likely be ideal for a while, but I'd like to make it so that there's at least a really good second option for ambitious people who want to meet other great people - I'm slowly working on solutions here.\n\nSo, in summary, Stanford is great, but use other things like Twitter to start meeting these people *now.*\n\nOh, one other note. A good way to think about achieving goals is - \"what is the number one limiting factor for me, right now?\" (e.g. maybe the answer is freedom, maybe the answer is money, maybe the answer is more people who you respect and who respect you, maybe the answer is having something really important to work on that you feel is your purpose, maybe the answer is self-confidence, etc)  \n\nIf you're ambitious, there'll almost always be so many things that you want to do and achieve.\n\nSo prioritizing is hard.\n\nThe trick I've found that works well for me that I wish I knew earlier was to ask this question - and then to *just* focus on the main limiting factor, until that is done, and then move onto the next one. There's almost always *one thing* that is 10x more important than everything else. Essentially this means always doing the single most valuable and hardest thing first. e.g. in the context of starting a startup that aims for $1b+, that would likely be finding an undervalued problem in a market that either is already large or will be really large ~7 years from now, where your main/first product could support ~$100mm in net income.\n\n&gt; \"Do you have any suggestions on what I should do to get into Stanford? I have tried to implement parts of your course into my daily life for my personal benefit, but I feel like getting into Stanford is vital for me to find people like me.\"\n\nThe strongest recommendations for this are the 'how to be a high school superstar' and this https://stanfordguide.org/how-to-get-into-stanford-6c8ebf1b6921\n\nAt a high level, this time allocation: https://www.reddit.com/r/GetIntoStanford/comments/6ye464/advice_for_if_you_are_still_in_middle_school_on/",

I have a few questions. \n\n1) What exactly do you mean by limiting factor? \n\n2) Any more specific tips on how to connect with like minded/ambitious people on twitter, or other sites? \n\n3) How good do you have to be at software to start doing consulting? Is this tutorial enough: https://www.railstutorial.org/book combined with perhaps building a real app: https://www.dropbox.com/s/9vq430e9s3q7pu8/Let%27s%20Build%20Instagram%20with%20Ruby%20on%20Rails%20-%20Free%20Edition.pdf?dl=0.\n\n4) How would you compare a Saas business, vs consulting? I would believe that consulting is easier with higher chances of making money, but IDK. \n\n5) Is it true that you can truly achieve anything that you decide to as long as it's not deemed impossible by the laws of physics? Because whenever I read great people's biographies, it seems as though they are geniuses and are far superior to any other person in a myriad of ways. In my opinion, I do believe it's possible, but I still want some doubts cleared. ",

                    "comment": "Thanks!\n\n1. limiting factor means the key constraint for a goal. for example, say you are a philanthropist. if you have lots of great things to fund, your key constraint may be deciding between them. the sub key constraint on this may be finding great people to hire to help you decide. or if you don't have lots of great things to fund but you have tons of money, you may be constrained by the lack of good things to fund -- the sub-constraint being more highly capable people starting great non profits in important areas that need money [the latter example is based on a real thing]\n\n2. What do you think will be specific challenges that you'd like tips around? Or if no specific challenges, what kind of tips would be useful? More guidance would be useful for me.\n\n3. Yes, that would be enough to start consulting. (Obviously not at a senior level, but enough at a junior level, imo)\n\n4. overly simplified: saas businesses are harder, but if they work, are likely to make more money over time, and you can be even more flexible with your time. consulting is more of a sure thing, and can make decent money generally much quicker than it would take for most people to ramp up sales for a saas product.\n\n5. not everything. but the concept is generally more true than people realize -- if it's a spectrum between believing you can do anything and believing you can do nothing, most people are far too close to the nothing end, and would be very well served by going much closer to the 'anything' end. \n\nhigh IQ helps. but the bar is lower than you probably think. \n\nand their superiority in large part comes from \"success spirals\" -- they do things, it goes well, they build confidence, they try and do more things which makes them learn more and gain more resources, they then build even more confidence, etc.",

If you don't mind I have some more questions. \n\n1) How do I generate success spirals. i.e. where should I start and what field should I start with? I still haven't found anything I love yet. Should I first find a problem that's important for the world and start with small projects related to that field? For example if I feel computer security is important, then I would learn web dev, make a website, and make it more secure than the average website.\n\n2) Also, about the twitter thing. How do I use it to find people who are aligned with my interests? How would I even search for them? Also, do you need a good amount of followers to be seen as credible to make connections? If so, how would you gain followers with the goal of finding people who are aligned with your interests? \n\n3) In college, how do you make friends with like-minded, extremely ambitious type people? So far my interactions with people have been pretty superficial, I haven't really gotten to know what people's goals and dreams are. How do go about looking for great friends and finding valuable people to work with and have deep meaningful connections with? It's my second week of college now.  \n\n4) What other books do you recommend that are not mentioned in the mentoring course? Like good biographies, etc. Also books that aren't as well known but very impactful.  \n\n5) How do you make an impact when there are tons of people working on it already and for way longer than you. For example, ML/AI, there are tons of people on it already and people who have much more experience. Pretty much every field is like this. Or do you find unique combinations of knowledge - like combining two different fields? Idk. \n\n6) Do you believe in the use of nootropics (like modafinil, the racetams, or even coffee etc.) as cognitive enhancers? Or do you believe that they can lead to dependency, even if they are non addictive like modafinil, which is bad? Do you think healthy food, good sleep, excercise, and meditation are all that's necessary for peak performance? Do you agree with this article which treats cognitive enhancers as simply technology that can be used for good: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v456/n7223/full/456702a.html?foxtrotcallback=true ?\n\n7) Right now I'm trying to question my ambitions, need for success, etc. Is the most important thing in life happiness or success? Because a lot of extremely successful people just aren't happy at all. If you take a look at history, the world's greatest conquerors, leaders, etc. were the least happy. I tend to agree with Buddhist philosophy that desire leads to suffering. I definitely see this in my own life. Naval Ravikant, in the the podcast you linked to in the course also talked about this stuff. Some people may argue that you shouldn't be goal oriented (i.e. desire oriented) but rather process oriented. But this doesn't seem too compelling. Sorry if I'm off topic, I just want to get the opinion of a person I respect.\n\n8) Also, how do I find a mentor? Everyone says that it's kind of important, and I probably agree.",

For example if I feel computer security is important, then I would learn web dev, make a website, and make it more secure than the average website.\n\nI view it like this. Visualize a graph that includes {all of the problems that you care about} + {all of your skills that you're good at}. Pick whatever has the highest magnitude. If you don't care much about any problem, then the highest magnitude thing will probably be a specific skill - so just use that skill. For me, I feel much more interested in specific problems than in any of my specific skills. In short, pick whatever is most interesting to you / you're most obsessed with - whether that's a skill, goal, problem, etc. If it's a problem/goal, then figure out how to make a difference and start on that - though more like - say you're obsessed with computer security, then figure out what the problems in the field are, figure out how to solve one of those problems, and then make a website to address one of those problems. This is hard and can take a few months, and require reading/emailing people/etc.\n\n&gt; 2) Also, about the twitter thing. How do I use it to find people who are aligned with my interests? How would I even search for them? Also, do you need a good amount of followers to be seen as credible to make connections?

So far my interactions with people have been pretty superficial, I haven't really gotten to know what people's goals and dreams are. How do go about looking for great friends and finding valuable people to work with and have deep meaningful connections with? It's my second week of college now.\n\nAsk people to talk a walk around campus. While you walk, ask them \"what's your story?\" Once they share theirs, share yours. Then if you still have time, ask them \"what are your most important goals in life?\" etc\n\n&gt; 4) What other books do you recommend that are not mentioned in the mentoring course? Like good biographies, etc. Also books that aren't as well known but very impactful.\n\nMentoring course has most of them. Most important: Principles by Ray Dalio, Sapiens, Poor Charlie's Almanack, a few biographies of people you like, and maybe Tools of Titans by Tim Ferriss. Roughly in that order. Perhaps also 'Hackers and Painters' and 'Conscious Living' at similar rank to the biographies.\n\n&gt; 5) How do you make an impact when there are tons of people working on it already and for way longer than you. For example, ML/AI, there are tons of people on it already and people who have much more experience. Pretty much every field is like this. Or do you find unique combinations of knowledge - like combining two different fields? Idk.\n\nFor you in ML/AI research it will be hard to have an impact.\n\nLook for fields that are undervalued. See this for good info: https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/\n\nSee also their career guide, I recommend reading it all: https://80000hours.org/career-guide/\n\n&gt; 6) Do you believe in the use of nootropics (like modafinil, the racetams, or even coffee etc.) as cognitive enhancers? Or do you believe that they can lead to dependency, even if they are non addictive like modafinil, which is bad? Do you think healthy food, good sleep, excercise, and meditation are all that's necessary for peak performance? Do you agree with this article which treats cognitive enhancers as simply technology that can be used for good: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v456/n7223/full/456702a.html?foxtrotcallback=true ?\n\nI think they can be used for good.\n\nThat said, I think most people's problem isn't working harder - it's that they aren't working on the right thing and haven't found something they are obsessed with that is meaningful for them and the world.\n\nI think modafinil might be helpful at making someone work harder, but generally picking the right thing to work on is more important, in my opinion. Lots of people work hard, very few people seem to have picked the right thing to work on.\n\n&gt; 7) Right now I'm trying to question my ambitions, need for success, etc. Is the most important thing in life happiness or success? Because a lot of extremely successful people just aren't happy at all. If you take a look at history, the world's greatest conquerors, leaders, etc. were the least happy. I tend to agree with Buddhist philosophy that desire leads to suffering. I definitely see this in my own life. Naval Ravikant, in the the podcast you linked to in the course also talked about this stuff. Some people may argue that you shouldn't be goal oriented (i.e. desire oriented) but rather process oriented. But this doesn't seem too compelling. Sorry if I'm off topic, I just want to get the opinion of a person I respect.\n\nPersonally, I want happiness. You can be goal oriented if your goals are framed in terms of things that improve happiness - like making X close friends, or contributing to the world using Y. Contribution and connection to people both seem to improve happiness (according to research I recall).\n\nThere isn't an overall answer. You can choose for yourself, and you can update/change your choice over time, too. Like I say, personally I don't want to be successful if it leads to unhappiness - I want to be very impactful and very happy. But I believe in part the reason I want impact is due to desire for contribution, which research suggests will increase happiness.\n\n&gt; 8) Also, how do I find a mentor? Everyone says that it's kind of important, and I probably agree.\n\nDon't look for a mentor, instead, find a problem you're obsessed with, then find experts who have the answers to questions that you have, and then email those experts extremely short specific questions. Over time, when you have an idea of what advice you need regularly, you'll know who you want as a mentor, and that person will like you more because they've been able to be helpful to you over time with questions.",

But the limiting factor if you don't yet have a highly promising startup is never management skill - it's having a skilled team in a great market with an undervalued idea/strategy of attack. If you're the CEO or expecting to be the limiting factor will almost always be the great, deep, thoughtful strategy on attacking what will be a large problem in a huge market. If you're likely to be a non CEO cofounder then perhaps the limiting factor is finding a CEO who will be your cofounder and is great at this market strategy piece. It's *not* learning about management - that can be learned later\n\nOr perhaps the limiting factor is having the self belief to feel and believe that you're capable of starting something massive and that you will find something massive\n\nEssentially, all problems that can be addressed later without major consequences (everything that could mess up the foundations and would have long term effects should be addressed up front) should be - because otherwise you'll never move on beyond premature optimization\n\nBased on their *stated* goals many people seem to waste large parts of their lives on things that they think are necessary for their goals, but really aren't limiting factors, and thus they are wasting lots of time if they care about speed of progress",

                                    "comment": "&gt; 1) How do we find a great market with an undervalued idea/strategy of attack? Do we just work on what we are passionate about and innovate from there? Or do we actively search for these markets?\n\nThere are two approaches that seem to work well. One is the actively searching broadly approach -- roughly what Jeff Bezos used that led to Amazon. The other is building many things, generally in things you're interested in, until one of them really takes off -- roughly what Zuckerberg did with Facebook.\n\nAlso, if you're going for $1b+, avoid committing to a startup at all costs until it's really obviously got a great chance of success (from your perspective) - you should be willing to fast for 30 days to start that company (or something along those lines, just intending to show that it should be an extremely high bar).\n\n&gt; 2) Are too many people working on building their own tech startups; is it getting too crowded?\n\nThere are probably always too many people working on bad companies / ones unlikely to be successful, and always not enough working on good companies.\n\nAlso, there are definitely not enough people working on impactful problems for the world.\n\n&gt; 3) Are all the great opportunities available only in the business/startup world? Or are there great, world changing discoveries to be made in fields like mathematics and physics? Or are these fields becoming too complex to be practical or useful? Why are so many people working on tech stuff, but I don't hear enough about physics, math, bio, medical breakthroughs? Is it just because tech is \"noisy\"?\n\nIt seems to be generally harder to have a large impact in physics and math - probably because there haven't been many fundamental changes in these areas recently, so most opportunities that exist have existed for a long time, which either means they have been already found, or that they are really hard to find. Bio and medical breakthroughs do seem interesting today with recent advances - e.g. machine learning advances + bigger datasets, and declining cost of genome sequencing.\n\n&gt; 4) Do you believe that all the great inventions have been already created and we are just further refining?\n\nNo, I don't believe that. But this question depends on the perspective of what you would class as an 'invention.' e.g. was the iPhone an invention? We had other smartphones. Was the Tesla an invention? We had other cars. etc.",

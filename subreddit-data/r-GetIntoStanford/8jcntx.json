Would I be considered as an international student when I apply from Germany? Does it make it much harder? Or should I go to a US high school for an extra year or something and apply from there? Thanks for any input.",

Email Stanford, they should get back to you relatively promptly.\n\n&gt; Does it make it much harder?\n\nI don't think it changes it meaningfully. International students I believe have a lower acceptance rate, but I think the identical applicant applying as an international student vs domestic student, the international might have a either a fractionally easier time getting in (if they come from a less competitive area, they may stand out more), or perhaps more likely, it would be about the same admissions rate.\n\nThat said, I'm not certain, so feel free to ask Stanford as well, and you should trust that their answer is true enough to follow!",

I guess I may have the option of applying as a German or as an American, and I should figure out which Option gives me a higher chance. Like you said, there may be no meaningful difference at the end anyways. I still have 3 years, just want to find out more and be prepared.",

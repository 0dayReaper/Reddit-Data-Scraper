    "postText": "**April 5th 2017: I get a ton of PMs asking for this, so to cut down on my PM volume...**\n\n**If this is highly interesting to you, then that means you're likely well suited to it. This is for ambitious people. If you're here, that's probably you.**\n\n**How to begin? Go here and submit this. [https://medium.com/@stanfordguide/stanford-mentoring-ebedc0e566f8#.wj9cwn8v6](https://medium.com/@stanfordguide/stanford-mentoring-ebedc0e566f8#.wj9cwn8v6)**\n\n\n\ntl;dr -- If you're highly ambitious and can prove it, and you're applying to Stanford I'll give you advice, and if and only if I am truly impressed then I will also write a recommendation letter (for your 3rd rec letter). Reply below or PM to indicate interest, and then I'll set up an application form soon. \n\nWhy am I doing this?\n\nIn reading my FERPA notes there were multiple mentions to my \"ad info\" being stellar. I asked someone what this meant, and they informed me it would be my additional rec letter, that was written by a Stanford student that I had met. I recently re-read this letter and I understand why it made Stanford want to let me in. I don't want to leave it up to chance and have Stanford miss people that could be great because they don't have a way to convey all the things that Stanford wants to see in the application.\n\nBasically I lucked out, but I hate relying on luck, so I want to eliminate luck for younger versions of myself. \n\n\nSo:\n\nFor people who are highly ambitious (maybe you want to make money and live a \"4 hour work week\" lifestyle, maybe you want to change the world, and you're probably not sure yet) and have a strong spark, I'll do a \"mentoring program\" that will basically consist of online advice on a) projects that you can build that create value and b) books that you can read that will teach you things.\n\nIn reviewing some people's applications this cycle I've come across a few people where I believe they are likely to be successful and where Stanford *should* want them, but I can see that they haven't necessarily been able to demonstrate why Stanford should want them beyond their achievements. So I'm worried that people of this type might not get in, even though I believe they should (this is basically what my application would've looked like if I didn't have my extra rec letter).\n\nI won't write a rec letter unless I can honestly write a glowing one.\n\nIf you just want the rec letter and don't want any advice/input on larger things then it's highly unlikely I'll be able to honestly write a positive rec letter.\n\nI will need you when messaging me to help provide me context so that I remember what you're working on and interested in etc. If I'm doing this with multiple people I find it hard to keep everyone's information in my head. I can always answer one off specific questions, but questions that require context I struggle with because I don't have the time to go and re-contextualize myself -- so I'll need you to do that for me.\n\nI'll need you to think that this is valuable even if I don't write a rec letter, because I won't write a rec letter unless I can write a glowing one, and so I am not okay with having extreme disappointment if I can't write a good letter.\n\nI am looking for people who will seek brutal honesty so that improvement times can be as fast as possible.",

Although I think it would be important for you to know that I don't have too much experience with building my own company or anything big like that so I might need a lot of guidance. I also don't have a bunch of money at the moment to start investing in things, so if that's something that would be necessary, I might not be the best fit. If you would be willing, I would like to continue working with you for the full six months as well!\n\nI've always been a fan of biographies of hundreds, potentially thousands of people, and I get inspired every time I read one, but I've always struggled to create a situation where I can succeed instead of waiting for one to come to me. It seems like a lot of people were just at the right place at the right time, took advantage of it, and never looked back, while others created their own opportunities to succeed. I don't consider myself deprived of opportunities, but being from Hawaii, I definitely did not have as much as I would have hoped. I'm hoping that for the rest of my life I can learn to make opportunities out of nothing instead of requiring resources to be handed to me to succeed. Regardless of whether you take me or not, thanks for offering!",

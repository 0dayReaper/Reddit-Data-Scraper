    "postText": "Hey - my local area hosts a program called Running Start. It's basically a program for juniors and seniors to get transferrable credits from community colleges. Students in Running Start still can apply to any college during their senior year, but I believe the credits are only transferable to local schools. Now, here's a bit about me:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I personally don't care about the credits or graduating from college early.\n\n\\- My high school is an IB school, so if not Running Start, I'd do full IB.\n\n\\- My main motivation for considering Running Start is that I heard the courseload and time commitment is a lot lower than going the traditional route for my school (currently a sophomore and I have school from 6:45-3:30 (almost 9 hours).\n\n\\- What I really want to do is invest my time in building products, startups, and creating value. Being independent in my own education (reading textbooks in free time, taking online courses for fun, etc.) is much more satisfying. And in a PERFECT WORLD (so almost definitely not possible), I would drop out of high school, take a gap year, and then enroll at a four year college. I'm not saying that I expect that to happen or work, but that just gives a sense of where my values lie.\n\n\\-And lastly, whatever I do, I plan to do it well. I just want more energy/time to work on my own projects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't want Running Start to limit my college options, especially Stanford. So what do you think? Will it affect the way Stanford views my application? Are my hopes/values a little skewed? Does anyone else have any experience with this sort of program?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nu/129183-stan-ps",

            "comment": "IMO you should strongly consider staying at your high school and doing the IB program. Truth be told, having exceptional academics is the first hurdle you must jump over to get into Stanford. I wouldn\u2019t risk tripping with this community college thing. \n\nWith decent time management, I\u2019m sure you can do great things even with the big time commitment. And when you do, it\u2019ll be even more impressive since you had to do it in addition to your rigorous studies. \n\nIf you don\u2019t believe me, during my sophomore year I was dedicating ~11 hours to school each day, but I still managed to scale a business to ~40k in revenue for that year. You can do it!",

Do/did you go to a very competitive high school? And did you compromise with that by doing extra work on weekends/breaks or sleeping very late?\n\nDo you think that having extra time and/or dedicating less time to school would have impacted the success of your business?\n\nAnd just so I have a frame of reference (if you're comfortable sharing), how was the business formatted and how did you manage to scale it?",

We also had to stay at school for 1-2 hours most days because some kids had extracurriculars. Thankfully I didn\u2019t have to try too hard in my classes to do well, so I normally finished my work during the commute.\n\n2. I purposefully chose to pursue something that wasn\u2019t affected much by school (I could work outside of business hours and on weekends), so extra time wouldn\u2019t have helped much. \n\n3. I\u2019d rather not say but it was fairly non traditional if that makes any sense. Since I had to work around my school schedule, I had to be creative. As for how I scaled it, I simply reinvested my profits to make proportionally more. The great thing about entrepreneurship is that you can pick anything that works for your situation, and this worked very well for mine.\n",

Would you still think that if it was apart of a typical program (and not out of exceptional talent to get there)?\n\nWhy don't you think you could've done a better job if you had more time on your social network?\n\nI read from your previous posts that your network was based on a video game community. Was most of your userbase because of viral growth (i.e. you didn't need to put too much time into scaling)?\n\nFinally, do you think being in a group/having cofounders would've influenced your decision to do CC or IB? Do you think it would've impacted your success?\n\nSide note - I feel the same way about your final comment. At school, I feel like I'm always aware of the opportunity cost that I'm paying out to be there instead of working on my projects.",

Think of it like this: if you were Stanford, would you admit someone with perfect grades in IB that is in a few typical clubs and maybe plays a sport or someone with mostly As in a **sufficiently** rigorous CC program that has scaled a business or project to either have lots of revenue or lots of users? I know I'd pick the latter. There are thousands of applicants like the former every year. Most get rejected. The key word is **sufficiently**. If you are **sufficiently qualified** academically, it generally stops mattering. Stanford values other things, especially intellectual vitality, above grades/test scores once you have shown that you will be able to stay afloat academically at Stanford. I firmly believe that having a good degree of success in a dual enrollment CC program and reasonable test scores (think 1450+) is sufficient to show Stanford that you will be able to survive academically.\n2. Sorry, my wording kind of sucked. I meant to say that I'm not sure if more time put into the project would've led to more success. I didn't meant to say that I don't think I would've had more success.\n3. Exactly. I wish I would've spent more time optimizing that viral growth. Viral marketing is powerful for consumer products if you can sustain it (think network effect).\n4. No, a group wouldn't have changed my decision. I would've liked to have a group, but being alone with most of my projects forced me to develop self-reflection skills that have proved invaluable to me in the long run.  In my eyes, it's only worth having peers if they are better than you in something important. You are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time around. Who you choose to associate with depends on how selfish you want to be.\n\nAnother note: I'm currently applying to schools and haven't been accepted to Stanford yet (I applied REA) so take my input with a grain of salt. That said, almost all of the information I gave you has come from current Stanford students or Stanford alums in some form or fashion.",

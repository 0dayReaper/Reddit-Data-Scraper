However, considering that I've seen many international applicants from my country (India) get rejected despite having insane passion for one activity (Olympiad medal, lab research, etc, etc.), do you think this still applies?",

Put them with the rest.\n\nSo, the advice applies, but the critical piece is making it perhaps more unique. If there'll be 100s of other applicants who look really similar to you (from the perspective of an average person who doesn't know the minutiae of all the different Olympiads etc), that's not ideal.",

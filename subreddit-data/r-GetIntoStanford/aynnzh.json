    "postText": "Hi there. I\u2019m a freshman Italian student who is really interested in moving to a US college. Since my family broke in November, I could not fulfill my application before February and I could not get the SAT scores on time. I will pass the SAT in June. \nI would like to know if submitting without SAT would be possible. I kept a 4.0 GPA Score in high school, worked for two years while studying, worked on an European startup and received about 6 high school scholarships.\nI\u2019m thinking about submitting my common app by March 15...",

You will be forced to apply as a transfer applicant, and it will be much harder to get in. If you pretend you've never been to a tertiary institute *just* so that you can apply as a freshman (and gain an unlawful advantage), your offer of admission will be rescinded if they find out (and they will).\n\nYou can always try to apply as a transfer, particularly to the state colleges. I've heard they are a lot more lenient on transfers -- so maybe colleges like the UCs, UTexas at Austin, etc.. Otherwise, I know that the vast majority of foreign students in the US come to the US as graduate students, so you won't be exactly 'late' if you choose to do so as well.",

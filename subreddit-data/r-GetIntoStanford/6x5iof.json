    "postText": "Honestly it seems that most of the \"businesses\" developed in these programs die soon after they leave.  Even looking on both programs' respective websites many of the featured businesses' websites are either nonexistent or lead to a 404 page.  I have two questions:\n\n1.  Will creating one of these \"companies\" really help one's admission chances, even if the business has barely gotten to making a prototype?\n2.  Are programs such as Leangap better than getting internships at established companies?  What about starting a business completely from scratch?  Do they actually provide more information and knowledge than Sam Altman's startup class or any of the other resources freely available on the net?\n\nThanks!",

Great internship will be better probably, but a great leangap exp probably better than mediocre internship. Starting a business from scratch is great, but hard. Also I'd say try and separate startup vs business - frame it as startup shoots for $1b+ revenue/earnings, whereas a business is something that doesn't involve massive commitments and you can scale up and down more freely and where you're not as reliant on investors etc. Other people have different framings but that's mine. And no, I doubt they provide better information and knowledge than sama's startup class",

I think it's great that more people are trying to work for themselves, but it's bad that people use one word \"startup\" to mean so many different things and aren't honest with themselves and others about their goals",

And yes almost everything coming out of those HS incubators die, usually anyways they never even become something in the first place other than a website template landing page, just being brutally honest, I think it would be better to build something by yourself at home if you want to actually get something done\n\nAlso def don't go with Leangap, it's pretty much a scam after talking to a few friends who did it",

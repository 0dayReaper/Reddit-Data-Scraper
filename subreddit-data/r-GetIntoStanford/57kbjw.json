There's an honor code, where people sign to agree that they will not cheat. Cheating rates are *extremely* low on exams at Stanford. They are *low* on assignments, but I've definitely heard of and seen cheating on assignments. Haven't heard of or seen cheating on exams.\n\nMoral of the story: They have to trust you, so be honest",

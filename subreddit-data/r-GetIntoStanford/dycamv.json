    "postText": "My stanford interview was terrible. She showed up 30 minutes late and rushed through my interview questions.\n\nStared at me the whole time and when asking about my passions refused to look at my project and LOOKED ME DEAD IN THE EYES.\n\nShe had a Harvard PhD and felt like I was talking to a wall with no follow up.\n\nShe couldn\u2019t speak english fluently either, and this is no insult to her intelligence SHE IS CLEARLY BRILLIANT. \n\nI am a great public speaker but I hate when I have no interaction with my audience. It was IMPOSSIBLE to get her to look at my project she asked about.\n\nDoes this interview truly have weight? I really pulled the short straw...",

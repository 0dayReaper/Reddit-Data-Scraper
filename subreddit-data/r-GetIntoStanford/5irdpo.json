    "postText": "I wrote a Personal Statement/Common App Essay for my Early applications. It's about me overcoming the culture barrier with my native family, while this essay has been regarded highly by many, I'm not sure if this is the kind of Essay for Stanford. \n\nShould I write up another Common App essay perhaps more around the idea of starting my business or like 'Tech Entrepreneur'-ing or move forward with my current essay?",

    "postText": "I need some advice on which topics to choose for the Stanford Admission Essays on the Common Application. I understand that I have biases in regards to what I think is important, but I don't have anyone in my own circle of acquaintances that is helpful enough to give me accurate advice.\n\nIf you want to help in a fast and quantitative way, I've created a survey in google forms. Otherwise, just leave a comment on the thread.\n\nI'm going to donate $70 dollars to the Against Malaria Foundation (https://www.againstmalaria.com/) regardless of the responses I get. If I get good data, I'll increase it up to $100 depending on quality. I think this should skate by any policies, as I'm not offering anybody anything directly ...\n\nhttps://goo.gl/forms/YbXgkDAzwmfxRtjC2\n\nI look forward to reading your responses!",

Could maybe make that clearer",

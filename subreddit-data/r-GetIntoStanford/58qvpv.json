    "postText": "Hey so I've been thinking of what to write about for the intellectual vitality essay. The two topics I was considering were my drop in grades or the hoby (service) conference I attended sophomore year. The drop in grades occurred junior year when my dad passed away (b in physics, c in spanish &amp; d another term &amp; another c). I was gonna talk about how that changed how I viewed grades and how I struggled in spanish. \n\n\nAny thoughts or did I misinterpret the prompt?\n\n\n As a side note, will my grades stop me from getting in? I had a 4.0 till junior year, ranked 14 weighted with the most rigorous course load, would've been around rank 5. My unweighted is 3.91\n\nEdit: forgot to mention this but I go to a school in the rocky mountain region, fairly competitive urban school, 500 are graduating. 4 others applying to stanford rea",

If you haven't already do the keynote exercise from the how to get into stanford post on stanfordguide.org",

I used to stay away from programming but then a friend asked me to join a class at my local uni. I learned object oriented programming as well as quite a bit of java in a week, almost to the point of obsession, in order to test out of the beginning class and go to the class I was going to take. I've done more computer science stuff since (like research and the computing olympiad) but that's what really got me into computer science.\n\nAs far as grades, does it matter that I am Asian (Indian)?",

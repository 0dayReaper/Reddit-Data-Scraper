Very informative guide. \n\n&gt; Many of the people who know the concepts in this guide (especially alums) don\u2019t bother to share it.\n\nThanks /u/129183-stan-ps for helping us high school students out!",

I know many non athletic Stanford students.\n\nThe rest of the first post is good.\n\nThe second post:\n\nDisagree with\n\n&gt; if your interests are a bit more towards engineering, that will slightly help your admissions chances\n\nThat may have been true 8 years ago, but I don't think it's true now. \n\nI kinda disagree with this\n\nif you are non-stem:\n\n&gt; you should consider competitions for speech, debate, writing, essays, and so forth.\n\nI think that you shouldn't do something just because a high school offers it, you should do things only that you are deeply interested in or exceptionally good at.\n\n&gt; Consider joining a sport -- many JV teams are not incredibly competitive. Also, play to your strengths -- if you\u2019re more dexterous than strong, choose squash, for example. If you\u2019re fast and have good hand-eye coordination, consider baseball. Sports teams will take up a ton of time though, so make sure you\u2019re well positioned and can handle the time commitment.\n\neh, i think a good applicant can find a better use for their time. unless of course they genuinely want to do the sport\n\n&gt;  Participation matters, getting small prizes like being treasurer or best debater matters.\n\nsure, but it doesn't matter much\n\n&gt; When it comes to spikes, the name of the game is to be highly-ranked in recognized fields. One of the most natural environments to be ranked in is a competition. Now, naturally, the more recognized the competition, the better. As you might imagine, the most well-known, difficult, and participant-heavy competitions are the most prestigious. It\u2019s better to rank in the top 1000 of one of the most prestigious competitions than it is to rank in the top 100 of a competition of middling prestige. Therefore, you should aim for the highest prestige competition you can do well in. You should consider competitions from highest prestige down in that order whenever possible. Here\u2019s how to start.\n\n\nOMG. disagree. this is one of many ways. you don't have to do competitions. sure, you can do competitions, but it's not vital at all\n\nthis dude is way too focused on competitions. they are just one avenue of many. \n\nother than that, the rest is good and i agree with.",

That is, they want to learn stuff not to make money, not to get a good job, not to impress teachers, but because they genuinely enjoy learning new things.\n\nWhat does this really mean? I fit in all the other categories, but this one is kind of vague. I like learning about specific things, but I don't like learning about everything. \n\nI like learning about cool science concepts, but I don't *love* to learn the more mundane aspects. \n\nI like reading novels, but I don't *love* learning about obscure analysis about the book. \n\nTo be honest, I think school teaches subjects in a boring way, in a way that most students don't really enjoy. I feel like everyone, deep down, enjoys learning but school takes this love away. ",

Or perhaps that the average Stanford student is in the top 1% of curiosity/amount of new knowledge they try and seek each week.",

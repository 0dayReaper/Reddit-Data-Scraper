    "postText": "I'm already in my junior year of high school and I know I need very good extracurriculars to get into Stanford. What kind of extracurriculars look the best? I can't-do sports because I'm not built for them at all but I have just joined an inter-highschool student-run organization of sorts. I am also going to join 1-2 clubs in my school and plan and running for the board of one of the clubs at the end of the year. I also plan on developing a few apps senior year. What else can I do to boost my college resume?",

It's easier than ever now to make apps, especially if you know html, css, and some js.  Check out ionic (angular) or react native.",

Once you have a solid grasp of Java, then you should look at a site called Udemy. It has a ton of courses on there, although some of them are paid. Hope this helps",

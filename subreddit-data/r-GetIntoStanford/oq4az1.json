    "postText": "high schooler here, about to enter senior year. So far I\u2019ve got three 95+ AP class grades, a 1440 SAT score, and pretty good grades all around (96-97 avg) but not too much in terms of extracurricular stuff. My focus in school is arts based so I\u2019m developing a general portfolio and also looking into arts competitions and internships I could work on. Im a bit worried that I started looking into this stuff too late, and I\u2019m not like gonna be devastated if I don\u2019t make the cut for Stanford I\u2019m more just seeing whether its worth getting my hopes up. Thanks, any tips greatly appreciated",

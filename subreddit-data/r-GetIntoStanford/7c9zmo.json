    "postText": "I\ufe0f applied EA to Stanford, and am super worried bc haven\u2019t gotten a message about interviewing yet. My understanding is that a representative emails you about meeting, right? \n\nOn the website, it says interviews will take place first few weeks of November. Obviously that time has not passed yet, so perhaps I\u2019m being overly-anxious?? \n\nHow do they determine who gets an interview (besides considering whether your geographical location is in an interview area - which mine is)?\n\nThank u so much ",

    "postText": "Let's assume your goal is to start companies / be an entrepreneur\n\nStanford gives a good signal/brand (sometimes useful for accessing opportunities). You can get a similarly good signal by working at particularly hot companies - eg opendoor, slack. You can get a job at one of these places if you become excellent at a certain set of skills that are valuable (eg software development, sales). Yes it's hard to get a job at one of these places without attending Stanford - but it's also hard even if you do attend Stanford!\n\nStanford gives you access to meet potential co-founders. Alternatives: working at a great company and meeting coworkers, writing online, and (imo the best option) writing thoughtfully and engaging thoughtfully and authentically on twitter.\n\nIn terms of actual education/content Stanford doesn't have that much of an advantage. If you have high discipline then moocs are just as good. If you want to be a software engineer, lambda school (Google it) is probably better than Stanford.\n\nStanford helps you meet friends. Group houses / co-living houses are an excellent alternative.\n\nIf you're thoughtful about your goals and the resources you don't yet have but you'll need to achieve your goals, you'll usually realize there are very good alternative ways to achieve them.",

I\u2019m not saying they are terrible but to grasp and study the true fundamentals like algorithms and data structures it requires generally a semester or longer. I mean grabbing a solid book on those topics will take longer than the brief introduction lambda gives students. \n\nThe majority of CS curriculum is spent on JavaScript, admittedly by instructors &amp; staff plus by colleague of mine, which is fine but for the $17k-$30k cost that\u2019s way too high. \n\nYeah they arguably teach you how to learn but so do many other institutions. \n\nWhat several of the alumni and present students admit is that they\u2019ve had programming / coding experience so it seems that it\u2019s not really a true \u201cno experience beginners\u201d course.

I mean grabbing a solid book on those topics will take longer than the brief introduction lambda gives students.\n\n- Lambda is 6 months, but it's 8am to 5pm. When I was at Stanford, I didn't attend almost all of my lectures, and I probably averaged less than 10 hours a week on the lectures I did attend plus homework. Assuming my time estimate is right, that means that Stanford CS looks like ~1560 hours. Lambda School is 6 months, but 1080 hours. Also, many of the Stanford hours went to non-CS things, e.g. liberal arts, other subjects, etc. And sure, it's definitely true that some Stanford CS students probably spent longer, but I see no reason why that couldn't give someone a pretty damn solid CS education.\n\nAnd cost wise, Stanford is ~$250k or so if you don't meet the financial aid stuff, so Lambda is much cheaper.",

    "postText": "Some background. My boyfriend is 28. He was homeschooled and wasn\u2019t really set up for collegiate success right out of school. \n\nHe has really good GED scores from several years ago (95+ percentile for everything except math [which was not a good score]). He hasn\u2019t taken the SAT yet.\n\nHe got into one of our local community colleges, but has yet to enroll. He would have to be a part time student since we can\u2019t afford for one of us not to work. How long would he need to take classes/how many credits would he need to consider applying for a transfer?\n\nRight now he works in apple retail, but he was able to intern with one of the analytics teams last year for 6mo. He is currently moving into a business team role in his store and within the next year he will be able to do another internship at corporate. \n\nI feel that he has a unique background and if he puts in the work at CC and especially shows improvement in regards to math he could be a very good applicant. He is interested in economics/law/finance. \n\nI wanted to get an idea for what our next steps should be so that we can set him up for success\u2026or if it is even feasible since he is older. ",

That\u2019s interesting that being older is an advantage, definitely good to know. I\u2019m not sure how many extracurriculars he would be able to do while also working, but apple has some volunteer opportunities that might be more accessible for us. \n\nThanks so much for responding!

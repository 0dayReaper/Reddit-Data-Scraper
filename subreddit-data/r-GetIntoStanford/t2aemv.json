    "postText": "I'm from a tier-3 (least ranking) college in India, and I just completed my Bachelor's in Technology (B.Tech) in Information Technology. I realised my passions too late. I didn't get any industry or research exposure at my college. I have been lazy - I don't have that spectacular GPA - I've got 7.57/10. I don't have many projects to showcase. I don't have any work experience. I don't have any publications. I don't have renowned (or accomplished) professors, or employers to give me good letters of recommendation. So I know, my chances of getting into Stanford for Masters is infinitesimally close to 100%.\n\nBut now that I've realized my passions, I want to make an impact, pursue research - specifically interdisciplinary research in AI and quantum mechanics. I would also like to do cutting edge research in healthcare and AI too.\n\nThe best education that I could probably get now, would be pursuing Masters in CS at a tier-1 (highest ranking) college in India, and then apply for PhD at Stanford. (I would appreciate if anyone could suggest universities outside India where I could possibly get a better education, considering my current records.)\n\nUnlike during my bachelor's, I don't want to be ignorant about what I should be doing.\n\nI still got time about deciding my masters. Should I consider getting employed under a corporate like Google, Microsoft, or Amazon and make an impact in the company, so that I get better chances for a post graduation or PhD at Stanford?\n\nWhat kind of influence does Stanford seek, specifically for admission into PhD?\n\nIf I joined a Master's program and I managed to get enough support to make projects &amp; publish papers, what else should I be doing, so that my application would stand out from many others who are doing exactly the same?",

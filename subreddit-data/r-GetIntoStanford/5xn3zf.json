    "postText": "Hi All,\n\nMy brother recently got admitted to Stanford University's graduate program in learning, design and technology. The link to the program's website is provided below:\n\nhttps://ed.stanford.edu/ldt\n\nWe are a middle class family from Pakistan. My father is a civil engineer and my mother is a school teacher. I am a doctoral student in a UK university (studying on a scholarship provided by the university). \n\nAs such, the cost of studying at Stanford is very high and we as a family are unable to afford these expenses. My brother is a bright and talented individual and it his dream to study at Stanford and he has worked very hard to get an offer from the university. He also possesses an undergraduate degree in computer science from the best and most prestigious university in Pakistan.  \n\nI would not want to see him unable to attend Stanford due to financial constraints. I am writing this message in the hope that someone on here can advise me or help in identifying the options which may help him fund his education. \n\nP.S. The university offered a small fellowship which only covers about 10-15 percent of the total cost of attending the program. \n\nIf you may be able to help or advise in anyway I would be grateful. If you need any other information about him or anything else to do with the program etc, please comment or send me a pm, I will try to respond as soon as possible. \n\nWe only have a short time to arrange for some funding. Thank you.",

While it's unlikely he will be able to get one every quarter, he just might\u2014I did! They cover full tuition and a reasonable salary for 5 to 20 hours of work per week.\n\nYou will still need a certain amount of money for the visa application. Research this first, but feel free to PM me for additional details. \n\nEdit: if this sounds too good to be true\u2014it's not very widely advertised as these positions can't be provided for every student.

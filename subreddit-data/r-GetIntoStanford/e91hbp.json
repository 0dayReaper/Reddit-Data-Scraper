I heard that some people with some B's were accepted. If it is a necessity, are we able to make up for relatively average grades with outstanding extracurricular activities, essays, and SAT/ACT scores?",

            "comment": "As always, the answer to this is that top universities have a holistic process and don't only look at grades - one or two B's are not going to make or break your application. \n\nAs a side note, Stanford ignores freshman year grades, so that may help if you did poorly then.",

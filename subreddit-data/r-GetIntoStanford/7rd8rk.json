    "postText": "(this doesn't apply for getting into Stanford, this is for the ambitious people taking the mentoring course)\n\nThe two books in the order I think they should be read\n\n1. Win Bigly\n\n2. Psycho-Cybernetics\n\nIf I was going to add a third, I'd add \"12 rules for life\" by Jordan Peterson. It's the most dense in wisdom book I've ever read, even more than Poor Charlie's Almanack. But I think people might get more out of it after having read more other books? I'm not sure. I felt highly receptive to the content. Perhaps that's the test - if you read 12 rules for life and feel like there are many \"wow\" moments, it's a good time to read it. Otherwise, shelve it and perhaps pick it back up in 6/12/18 months.\n\nI'm sure they are available on library Genesis (see Wikipedia if you don't know what this is).\n\nCan a few people beta test this for me, by sending me a PM that they will do this, along with a few sentences about their life and view on the world now, and then once you've finished the books, send me a PM. Then I'll follow up in a month or two to see what benefits you believe you've gotten.\n\nUpdate, additional context:\n\n- Win Bigly was valuable because it destroyed any political identity I had left - even though I had very little relative to people I know, I still had some, I now have much less, though of course still some. This was useful to me because I believe the Charlie munger statement that \"ideology cabbages the mind\" and my conservative and liberal filters were making it harder for me to pay attention to what might be True.\n\n- Psycho cybernetics was useful because it was the best book I've read on the \"how\" of success - not planning, but more like on a day to day level once I know exactly what needs to be done, how to take advantage of your own self image to be the person you want to be and achieve the things you want to do.",

                    "comment": "Yes the 2 in the OP I think have a high likelihood of replacing my other recommendations.\n\nI think those 3 are all in my top 5 books in terms of amount of \"knowledge\" contained - but for most circumstances, knowledge and utility/usefulness are very different.\n\nI think the 2 in OP are potentially highest usefulness, even if the three that I used to recommend most highly that you mentioned may have more wisdom/knowledge.\n\nI think it's different for different people - particularly if you're already doing exactly what you want to be doing and you just want to optimize it (1 to n in Peter thiel terms), eg think a successful investor who wants to learn to make better investing decisions, then optimizing for knowledge is probably close to equivalent with optimizing for usefulness. However if you're not yet successful or doing what you want to do, then you want to optimize more for being able to change your circumstances (more like 0 to 1 in thiel terms) -which usually requires more than just knowledge.\n\nIf this doesn't make sense to anyone let me know",

My main problem is basically not doing my work as efficiently as I could and using my free time in the best way (http://calnewport.com/blog/2009/01/16/3-simple-rules-for-making-your-free-time-count/). I'm in college btw. \n\nI'm trying to follow Cal Newport's methods though: going to isolated libraries, studying with timer to up my intensity of focus, and starting early. I'm getting better at this though (especially because of my Cold Turkey site blocker which is currently saving my ass). ",

Persuasion is important to me, but right now Psycho-Cybernetics seems more relevant (judging from first few pages). Could I read both at the same time? \n\n2) I know this might seem lame, but it's obivously a large problem for me and other people. But can Psycho-Cybernetics help solve procrastination? For example if you want to get fit and go to the gym regularly, could it help with those types of goals?\n\n3) What were the tangible effects of Win Bigly and Psycho-Cybernetics on your life? \n\n4) Do you believe in free will? In the back of Win Bigly, it recommends some books (like Free Will by Sam Harris) which argue that free will is an illusion. Just wondering. ",

    "postText": "I've read the guide and lurked on this sub for a while.  Most of the information seems geared towards HS students.  I had a poor GPA in high school and joined the Army directly after I graduated.  After almost 4 years in the Army I've decided to get out and go to college.  I never took the SAT or ACT and I understand I will have to go to community college first.  Is it even possible for me to get in if I have a stellar GPA from community college?  Will being a veteran improve my chances or hold any weight at all in my application?  What steps can I take to increase my odds of getting accepted?  Thank you for your time.",

Both of these organizations are dedicated to preparing you to attend college. I know a few guys that started last Fall at Stanford, and these programs were a tremendous help to them. Also, every person I know that was accepted to Stanford (3 people) started at community college. Service to School can provide you with ACT/SAT prep and help you with the application process. What most veterans aren\u2019t aware of is the fact that these top-tier schools WANT them to apply and enroll. The best way to make yourself a competitive applicant is to enroll in difficult classes at a community college and do well. You have to show that you\u2019re able to perform well in a college classroom. Your academic performance, in addition to your military experience, makes you a desirable applicant. I understand you may still be enlisted, but get in touch with the programs I linked above. The sooner you start the process, the better. Feel free to PM me. I got out of the Navy after 10 years, and these organizations have been phenomenal. \n\nedit: Fixed hyperlinks",

What would you say is a competitive GPA for me to have in Community College to be considered for Stanford?  What other sorts of things are they looking for on applications?  Any help is greatly appreciated!",

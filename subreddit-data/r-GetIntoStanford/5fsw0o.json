Upwards trend is important and senior year grades are reflective of your current abilities.\n\nThat being said, if they really want you then a B isn't going to change that. Getting Bs on your transcript is human. A few Bs on senior year will hurt, but it depends on other quantitative factors then eg. testing and your previous grades and qualitative factors such as:\n\n* You had special circumstances in your senior year\n* Your workload/courses selected are more rigorous (and thus your drop in grades would reflect that)\n\nIf you get like 3 Bs without these type of reasons then it won't look good. (Take my advice with a grain of salt though.)",

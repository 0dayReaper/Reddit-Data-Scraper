    "postText": "Hey everyone!\n\nQuick question- would love to gather some opinions. Stanford is my absolute DREAM school, and I am planning to apply REA next year. I have a 4.4 GPA and one-of-a-kind entrepreneurial experience(s) that will set me apart from the rest, but I've never been a strong test taker. I'm taking my SAT in Nov and I am a little concerned that I won't have the best score (1400+ though). In your opinion/experience, what is Stanford's current \"bar\"? I read the guide, just wanted to ask for more updated opinions since I'm assuming it gets more competitive each year? Or is it still around 1380?\n\nWhat score are they looking for and what are they willing to accept in an extracurricular strong student? I know they weigh GPA more for sure, but SAT/ACT still plays a part.\n\nThank you!",

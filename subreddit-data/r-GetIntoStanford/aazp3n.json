    "postText": "is it okay if we're very casual in our supplements? i thought it was and it helps us connect with the reader but sometimes i wonder is it better to try to show our writing skills? or unless we can make super amazing beautiful writing it's just better to go casual than to fall somewhere in the middle? or am i just entirely wrong and casual phrasing has no correlation with what makes writing good \n\n\nwhat do you guys think? i know the guide touched base on it a bit but if anyone that got accepted could maybe let us know how casual u were (besides the roommate essay) that'd be great!! \n\n\nalso sorry but would casual + creative + good story be important to all colleges or is it a stanford thing or is it a highly selective college thing ",

I didn't use any slang, kept exclamation points to a minimum, followed all rules of grammar, used  correct word forms etc.\n\nBasically, I used the same tone I did for most of the essays I wrote for school.\n\n(I got in REA).\n\nEDIT: I've been offering essay review around reddit recently, and if you or anyone else reading this want someone to look at their essays feel free to PM me.

    "postText": "Cath in College (a Stanford vlogger) used the FERPA loophole to see her application. This excerpt from her blog details what she saw (she wasn't allowed to take photos):\nhttps://cathincollege.com/2015/04/08/i-saw-what-stanford-admissions-officers-said-about-me/ \n\n\nAs admissions officers look over your entire application, including essays, recommendations, and a \u201ccheat sheet\u201d called the \u201cdocket report,\u201d they jot down their impressions, including whether or not they think you should be an (all-caps) \u201cADMIT,\u201d on a \u201cwork card.\u201d Up to 3 admissions officers, or \u201creaders,\u201d will fill out a work card, in which they write in plain English what they think about you. 2 readers looked at my application.The readers assign you several scores. Brenda told [Cath] that \u201c1\u201d is the best, but she doesn\u2019t know the scale, so [Cath's] scores are essentially meaningless. \ud83d\ude26 Scores are given in the following categories: Tests, High School Record, Support (Letters of Recommendation,) Non-Academic, Self-Presentation and Intellectual Vitality, and the reader\u2019s overall recommendation. I found the \u201ccheat sheet\u201d that the readers use when going over applications particularly interesting. Here are the exact statistics readers have on the docket:\n\nSex\n\nEthnicity \u2013 Ethnicity was coded on the docket. Nowhere does it say \u201cWhite European\u201d or \u201cFilipino\u201d for me, but it does say 5E and 2P. Interesting.\n\nDiversity \u2013 This is a Yes or No on the docket. Very interesting.\n\nGPA\n\nSU6 \u2013 A unique score generated by Stanford; essentially the unweighted GPA of your last 6 semesters of high school.\n\nRigor \u2013 Possible entries are again coded. For example, I got an \u201cMD\u201d for \u201cmost demanding.\u201d I don\u2019t know what all the possible options are.\n\nRank \u2013 High School ranking. N/A for Barrington students.\n\nP% \u2013 Percentile ranking in your high school class. Again, N/A for Barrington.\n\nSAT and subscores\n\nACT and subscores\n\nState\n\nInitial Aid \u2013 I was surprised to find this on the docket. I guess \nStanford isn\u2019t truly need-blind after all?\n\nGEN1 \u2013 Yes or No for whether or not an applicant is a first generation student\n\nAffiliation \u2013 i.e. Legacy: Were you parents trees or nah? I\u2019d be interested to find out if siblings get noted on here. Hmm\u2026\n\nTalent/Sport \u2013 Mine was blank. Makes me wonder how high achieving somebody has to be in a talent or sport for it to qualify to appear in this section.\n\nSAT Subject tests\n\nAP tests\n\nTOEFL \u2013 (Test of English as a Foreign Language. N/A for native speakers.)\n\nInterview score \u2013 N/A for non-interviewees like myself.\n",

    "postText": "I just got rejected a few weeks ago and I've wanted to go to Stanford for most of my life. I'm from PR so it was hard to work on my application with the hurricanes but I applied early regardless, making it pretty lackluster (mainly the essays). I regret it completely and it haunts me everyday, but either way I probably wouldn't have gotten in. \n\nI just wanted to see if anyone knows of someone who has gone through the same and been accepted as a transfer student, and I wanted to know the most important things to do during freshman year. My scores, grades, and ECs are well above average but it still feels impossible to me. I know its like a 1% acceptance rate but im going to try anyways.\n\nIm just wondering if its worth and if it is, tips are appreciated.",

            "comment": "They will pretty much autoreject anyone from a serious college according to what they've said on their website. It's targeted at people transferring from community colleges who can't learn in their own schools. Also I think it puts you at a disadvantage if you've applied in the past as a non transfer student. Your best bet is honestly doing a graduate program there, although if you end up at a CC or at a school that's really terrible for you then it's worth applying. That said, just because you get into a Top 50 school instead of Stanford you shouldn't feel bad about yourself. It's incredibly hard to get in and it's something that's very close to random. Most schools are great places as long as you try your hardest and there are tons of opportunities out there. Don't let getting rejected from Stanford hold you back. Prove them wrong and have them begging for you when you apply for a grad program.",

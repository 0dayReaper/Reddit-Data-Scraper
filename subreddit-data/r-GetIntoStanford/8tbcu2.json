Do you think running a start up will ruin other parts of my application? Will it look favorable since I\u2019m dedicated to something I\u2019m truly passionate about, something that will help everyone in some way? ",

My suggestion is to read all the stuff in the FAQ because it's a call you'll want to make for yourself.\n\nThat said, my thoughts\n\n- worst case, if your business is working as you say it is, you scale it up, you don't get in, but you can afford to move to Palo Alto anyway and you can get to know people at Stanford and in the bay area tech community, and you'll be more impressive than most of them if you have a healthy business at your age\n\n- best case you scale it up and get in. I'm inclined to say that focusing on the biz won't hurt your application - but I do think it's important for you either way to read the FAQ, understand what Stanford wants, and make sure you reveal with data and stories how you have some of those attributes, in your application",

I think the dropping is a good idea, however the problem is I'm getting a letter of recommendation from the teacher so I'm not sure if this is good. \n\nThe letter of recommendation will be sent almost a month before I drop the class though. \n\nAlso, if I drop what could be a good reason to tell colleges why I did so?

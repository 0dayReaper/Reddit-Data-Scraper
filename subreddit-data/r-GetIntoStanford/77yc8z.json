    "postText": "Hey, this is a Freshman here. I know it's a bit early to be thinking about going to colleges, but I want to start my base for my extracurricular now. In my four years, I'm planning on publishing a book that will hopefully gather some success because I find that I enjoy writing. From the posts here though, everyone seems to have extracurriculars a good deal more advanced and developed than I could ever hope for (varsity athletes for three years, international/national awards). My question is would publishing a book that gathers a decent (maybe interstate/state) level attention and the typical extracirrculars be enough to get me in? Is Stanford a good fit for one who enjoys writing? Thanks for your time; I truly appreciate any responses.",

Find a couple of activities that you *genuinely* enjoy and do them exceptionally well. \n\nIf you love writing and the thought of getting published excites you, go for it. Just don't do something simply for the sake of college admissions. That would be a waste of time.",

Go through **everything** (seriously, strong recommendation) here: https://www.reddit.com/r/GetIntoStanford/comments/734b2q/faq_info_for_new_users_and_a_mentoringadvice/\n\n&gt; My question is would publishing a book that gathers a decent (maybe interstate/state) level attention and the typical extracirrculars be enough to get me in?\n\nA book with interstate level attention could be very impressive. But that's a very non-specific thing. I'd expect that anyone who sells 500,000 copies of a book and has excellent grades and good test scores get in. Basically, if the book related stuff is really impressive, you have a great chance.\n\n&gt; Is Stanford a good fit for one who enjoys writing?\n\nProbably depends on what you want to write about. If you're writing about technology, definitely. If you're writing about politics, yes - and Yale or others would probably be great also. \n\nGood question to ask yourself is:\n\nWho are the 5 people in the world that I don't personally know, that I deeply admire (if you can't think of 5 people where you deeply admire at least some aspects of them, you should address that promptly!)? Where did they go to school? What did they study?",

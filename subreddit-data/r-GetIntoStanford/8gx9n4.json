    "postText": "Hey! I\u2019m a rising senior and so to get the point- what\u2019s the best way to make the most out of the summer, it\u2019s three months of endless possibilities and I\u2019m always worried I\u2019m not utilizing the time.\n\nI currently plan to take on a leadership role on a state wide student charity that I was a part of last year as well and grow my own non profit organization. And of course, I will spend a looot of time essay writing and crafting a good story! \n\nProblem is I don\u2019t have an internship :// and it\u2019s pretty late in the game so I\u2019m not sure if I should keep looking or try to pursue something independent. I live around the DC area if that helps at all. \nI maybe will be part time coaching with my summer swim team and I know I could also find my job. Hopefully, I can also cultivate one of my passions- I have a business idea and I will try to make it into a reality. My ECs are currently okay, I have a ton of school leadership roles but nothing that unique, my non profit is in the middle of growing, so I really feel like this summer is my last chance to demonstrate my potential. \n\nIf i do something in the summer is it too late to be meaningful? What if I work hard on it and it grows- could it still matter. \n\n\nExtra personal stuff about me- I have competitive stats and it\u2019s probably the best thing about me but my ecs are eh. The standard leadership school roles and such. I plan to expand my main non profit business though, still it\u2019s pretty basic but it\u2019s something I enjoy and have been doing for four years- it\u2019s about tutoring. However the charity that I discussed is really similar to it (its not specifically tutoring but it\u2019s like programs guiding less fortunate students) is this okay? Is it fine If I still spend my time on both or should I choose one since they\u2019re similar ideas. my academic interests: business, economics, entrepreneurship of course, international relations\nInterests I haven\u2019t really explored but enjoy- philosophy, virtual reality, producing music \n\nNote: I\u2019ve read the Stanford guide! Also I realize I may not even be competitive at Stanford but I adore the concept of Stanford and this sub (intellectual vitality etc.) ",

(In life)\n\nIf you don't know, maybe spend time exposing yourself to possible future life outcomes and in reflection/introspection to learn more about yourself.\n\nIf you know, and you want a \"typical\" life then perhaps you just want to optimize for whatever will give you the biggest boost in admission chances. \n\nPersonally, I'd optimize for: if there's something you can be highly confident that at the end of the summer will allow you an &gt;80% certainty of achieving some goal that you really really want, do that. If there isn't, then spend the summer working on a goal that you don't know what it'll get you, but it seems most deeply *interesting.*",

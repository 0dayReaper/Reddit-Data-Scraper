Also, since I only have ten slots for activities, how do I decide which ones to put? Do I put the most impressive ten or just the ten that would display how I spend my time even if they aren't that impressive when viewed on their own? If I've been deficated to one or two, but they might he seens as \"common\" or even \"stereotypical,\" would that put me at a disadvantage?",

My general answer would be make sure to put a few of the more unique ones, perhaps 5-6 and then ~4 of the ones that are more reflective of your time? Feel free to post the list here on the thread (remove identifying information if you want, but i don't think it's a big deal either way), and i'll comment on them in this thread (please don't PM)",

Would there be any particular order I should put them on the Common App? I know most people say to put the ones you've dedicated most time to first (which usually relates to what you are passionate about, for me it's swimming and Boy Scouts, despite not being nationally recognized for either), but since those are \"common\" activities, could it potentially be better to put the interesting ones first and then round it off with the more \"common\" stuff and minor activities? Also, I made a post regarding the Stanford's ACT testing policies, and I was wondering if you could take a quick look in case you knew anything. https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/55xsie/stanford_act_policy/",

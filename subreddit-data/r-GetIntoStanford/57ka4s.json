(And for smaller outfits it's still beneficial, but proportional to the significance of the article/coverage/media outfit)\n\ne.g. \n\n&gt; What is objective and what is contextualized?\n\n&gt; \u201cI won X award\u201d is objective, but not contextualized. \u201cI won X award, awarded by Y institution that you know about, that has Z applicants and accepts X people\u201d is objective and contextualized. I can immediately understand that this is significant.\n\n&gt; \u201cI built X thing\u201d is objective, but not contextualized. \u201cI built X thing, and it solved Y problem, and it currently has Z users and makes $X each month\u201d is objective and contextualized. People understand money and number of users and can assign it significance.\n\nfrom the how to get into stanford post",

I might be able to make it into Business Insider. \n\nBut the thing is I moved the manufacturing to another country, and I'm still waiting for the shipment to arrive, it may come in the next month or so. \n\nAfter my shipment arrives safely, then I will try to get media recognition. But the problem is I won't be able to do this in time for Early Action, do you think this would be worth a wait to apply Regular Decision? Maybe I can update the admissions office later since I'm apply Early.\n\nThe thing is I already have good statistics on my business (decent revenue). I'm not sure if media recognition will change anything. ",

    "postText": "There are many many other good options.\n\nAs just one example, I believe a large portion of the value I got from Stanford was the people I met in one particular class (no longer offered).\n\nIt would've been 100% possible for someone who was a non-student to come to that class and get the same value. If asked what year/dorm they lived in, they could've easily responded - \"oh, I'm on a gap year and considering the option of whether I should go for Stanford next year, or just go straight into startups.\" \n\n## Stanford's value and how you can replicate it\n\nEducation: This is available mostly online. Or you can literally visit campus and drop into classes. Twitter is also full of knowledge. And books are massively under-valued.\n\nBrand/signaling/resume: You can get something similar here by working for a breakout startup, or by building great products e.g. and launching them on Product Hunt.\n\nNetwork/people: You can get something similar here by spending a few months in the bay area. And by using Twitter, and blogging and tweeting! Sar Haribhakti and David Perell are two examples of people who seem to have built great networks using twitter. Also join networks like the effective altruism network.\n\nPath to great jobs: Check out the bootcamps below, network using cold email skills and/or twitter, build side projects, read https://80000hours.org/career-guide/how-to-get-a-job/.\n\nEnvironment: Move to the bay area for a few months, and you can literally spend all of your days on campus at Stanford. There's no security preventing you being on campus, and tons of non-students are on campus each day.\n\nAlso, other things to check out:\n\n- https://salesbootcamp.com/ (seriously, sales is SUCH a valuable skill)\n\n- https://www.alwayshired.com/\n\n- https://www.sv.academy/\n\n- https://vendition.com/\n\n- https://techpoint.org/sales-bootcamp/\n\n- https://courses.salesbootcamp.com/p/sdr\n\n- https://lambdaschool.com/\n\n- https://twitter.com/FeynmanThomas/status/1016497837079650304\n\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/leanfire/comments/8wrqvd/the_work_remotely_and_live_internationally/\n\nWhat questions do you have? What limiting beliefs (e.g. thoughts like \"that won't work because of XYZ\") do you have that I can help squash?",

So my general advice would be to find advice elsewhere, but I'll add that you would likely also benefit from reading some books on selling with the written word, as I figure a personal statement is selling them on accepting you. So seek advice elsewhere, and supplement that advice by reading the books \"Cashvertising\" and \"The Ultimate Sales Letter.\"",

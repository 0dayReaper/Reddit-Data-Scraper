It's extremely relevant.\n\nI'm the same way -- I have low discipline and failed to force myself to do things that I don't want to do (like homework).\n\nHowever, it's not always a problem. It wasn't a problem for me because I would read about random things that interested me, which made me more interesting, and I would read about making money online, and then build websites, etc. So I would say follow your interests but make sure that they are things that are at least somewhat valuable to other people/the world.\n\ni.e. mindlessly procrastinating on facebook is not so good, but mindlessly procrastinating reading about how to make XYZ things and then making that thing to procrastinate on homework == good",

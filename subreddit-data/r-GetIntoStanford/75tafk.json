I take AB calc and do fine on the tests but I also have economics listed as my interest on the common app? Should I change it to reflect my strengths like english and reading based careers? ",

If there's a non math heavy major that you're truly considering and are likely to do - sure, consider it. Otherwise stick with the truth",

As in show I'm good at math through other tests or retake the ACT? I got a 36 in the science section if that helps at all...",

    "postText": "Hi! I am a sophomore, and I think I have a pretty huge spike in art. I have a couple national finalist awards and state awards for my Western and Chinese art. Since I have been doing art pretty much my entire life, I don\u2019t think the AOs are going to think I\u2019m doing it just for my resume. Does Stanford have a good art or design major?\n\nEdit: typo",

            "comment": "Few points on this:\n\n* Note that whatever major you choose for Stanford isn't binding, it's flexible to pick.\n* What design are you referring to? Many of the programs at Stanford are focused around the [d.school](https://d.school) which is well known, especially in engineering and majors such as product design.\n* In terms of art practice, off ranking alone it's probably one of the few departments that's not top ten in the country TBH (if that's even a concern for you), but there's lots of resources available for you as a student and a lot of opportunities to present your work.\n\nGood luck!",

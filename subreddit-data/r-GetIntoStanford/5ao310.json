What problems does it solve for people? How much value has created?\nWhy did you give a shit? What made you care enough to do it? Or if was just following an interest, what made you interested/curious enough, what was the path to get here?\nIf it\u2019s something you learned: What did you learn? What made you want to learn that? What have you used the knowledge to do?\nUse objective things. Stories of customers or people using it to solve problems. Statistics on the number of users.\nThousands of applicants have built things or done research and can make it sound like it might be interesting, but admission officers know this \u2014 they look for people that have done things that are truly significant. Make it easy for them to spot you if this is you!\n\n\n\nI have a more specific question: How many users are impressive? \n\nIf you built a website, what amount of views or signups are impressive/significant? \n\nIf you created an app, how many downloads are impressive/significant? \n\n/u/129183-stan-ps\n",

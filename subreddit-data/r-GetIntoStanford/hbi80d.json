    "postText": "I am a rising Junior from a decently competitive school, and I am thinking of applying REA to Stanford. My gpa and test scores are all really good (**4.0 UW, 4.6W, 15APs, 36 ACT**), and my ECs/Awards are good, but nothing amazing. I have a couple questions about some strategy when applying Stanford REA. I am also interested in SymSys.\n\n**ECs:**\n\n1. **Chess Club**\n   1. President, played for 10 years, won various state titles, certified master, taught at many schools, organized tournaments in school, volunteered in camps.\n2. **Debate**\n   1. Senior Captain, done for 7 years, invitational and regional awards, extemporaneous speaking, taught younger students.\n3. **Business Startup**\n   1. Founder and CEO, sports sharing social media platform, organized development team, legalized, full stack developer in Python and IOS app developer, in beta phase.\n4. **Physics Club**\n   1. Vice President, helped prepare students for the annual physics bowl competition, studied Mechanics/E&amp;M/Optics/Thermodynamics/Modern Topics.\n5. **Physics Organization**\n   1. Founder and Executive Director, hosted physics competitions for students to make up for the lack of physics opportunity, allowed schools to register chapters, hundreds of students and 10+ registered schools across the US and Canada.\n6. **Math Volunteering Organization**\n   1. COO, registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit, spreads STEM in local schools, partnered with local university, in a decent amount of schools and taught a lot of younger students.\n7. **Physics Research**\n   1. Machine learning in quantum mechanics research with professor at T20, used machine learning to do DFT calculations in order to approximate properties of a crystal structure based off of its crystal defects, not published yet (hopefully soon).\n8. **Business Club**\n   1. Committee Member, competed in economics and finance related events, placed for various events at the state level and qualified for nationals.\n9. **Tennis**\n   1. Varsity\n10. **Math Honor Society**\n   1. Participate in math competitions such as state competitions and AMC, placed in various math competitions (nothing special), ARML competitor.\n\n**Awards (kept vague):**\n\n1. Top 20 in some international physics competition (not overly prestigious tho, but still).\n2. State chess champion for K-12.\n3. Placed nationally in statistics competition.\n4. Some state math competition award.\n5. Qualified for national for financial math in business club\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Recommendation Letters:**\n\n1. Counselor (8/10)\n2. Physics Teacher (10/10, done all 4 physics AP, very good in class, talked to teacher a lot)\n3. Latin Teacher (9/10, had for 4 years, did research project on philosophy with him, very close)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I think I have a pretty clear STEM tilt, but obviously it is not going to be good enough to rely on in order to get into Stanford REA. I have always done a lot of social science classes and I think it is smart to portray myself as somebody who is good in STEM but also very interested in philosophy (I have read a lot of philosophy, and did a philosophy project with my Latin teacher). My essays mainly focus on my world view of combining philosophy and physics to construct meaning in obscure things, and I think they are really unique. I am also thinking of doing Symbolic Systems if I go to Stanford, so I think highlighting my philosophy/psychology learning in combination with physics is a good idea for that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuestions: \n\n1. I am asked my Latin teacher for 2 recommendation letters: 1 for Stanford specifically and 1 for general schools. In the Stanford letter, he will talk a lot about the philosophy project I did and how SymSys will be a good fit for me. **Will this provide a significant benefit for me?** \n2. I have heard that Stanford REA gives a lot of benefit to hooked applicants which is not me, **Will Stanford REA give me a boost over RD?**\n3. **Can this whole philosophy + physics combination make me stand out in my college application?**\n4. **How much will my demonstrated interest in SymSys matter?**\n5. **Any general essay advice for me?**",

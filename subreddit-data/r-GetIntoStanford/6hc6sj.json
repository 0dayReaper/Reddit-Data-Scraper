Gives you much more leverage\nAnd it's easy to do\nEg maybe that's learn rails by following rails tutorial until you can build basic web apps\nOr learn html and CSS until you can build basic homepages by editing bootstrap templates\nAlways make it easier for yourself - look for html templates that you can modify vs starting from scratch, tutorials you can follow that'll get you close to what you want, things like webflow.com that remove the need to learn certain technologies etc\n\nIf you want to start companies, don't do something that helps you be hired as a CEO or Cto. 1) they are very different things 2) to be hired in as a CEO to a good company requires so many years of experience, do you really want to wait that long?\n\n\nWhy do you want to start companies?\nIt's always Worth putting extra thought into your goals.\nI'd say find the PDF of principles by ray dalio and do his 5 step plan for your life. He's worth $10b+ and wrote a book about how to get what you want",

    "postText": "I've always had the dream of creating a business as a teen, but haven't really known where to start. As I have been browsing through this subreddit, I've seen a lot of people mention that they own businesses, which has really intrigued me. I was wondering if any one of these people would be willing to share their stories of creating a business as a teenager or advice for a rising junior who is really interested in entrepreneurship. Although I really want to get into Stanford and I know that creating a business would help my admission chances, I mostly want to know about this because of my sheer interest in the subject and desire to make money without having an actual job. I want to be able to pursue this interest this summer (I've just started /u/129183-stan-ps 's course), so I'd appreciate it if anyone would be able to contribute. And if you don't want to share your story with everyone else, feel free to PM me anything -- it would be greatly appreciated.",

My advice to you would be to keep making cool shit that you love - and if you find a way to effectively monetize it, even better.",

See if those pain points match up with others (your friends and family would usually tell you it's a great idea, and some people would just be nice simply because you're a teenager). \n\nAlways keep validating your idea no matter what. Also don't get a false sense of security that you're actually doing something by having much approval from others around you. Basically don't be me. Just put 1 minute a day in what you think you love to do, and you'll find yourself wanting to do more or unfulfilled without them.\n\nReach out in respective fields of what you want to do. You need guidance, you'll naturally fall into traps or bad habits. Find something you want for life, and it will surely show through your actions/efforts.",

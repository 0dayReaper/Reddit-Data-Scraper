    "postText": "I am currently a rising senior (undergraduate) in Mechanical Engineering with a 3.3 GPA from UIUC. In addition to that, I am part of my school's SAE team and have performed research under two professors as well, as part of my extra curriculars. I was wondering if there is any particular GPA range for graduate school at Stanford (MS in Mech E).",

    "postText": "If I am in some organized activities that could potentially call for an additional LoR, would admissions officers wonder why I didn't submit one? This isn't for Stanford in particular, but I'm actually applying to a college EA that's not nearly as competitive as Stanford, but I forgot to get my additional (non-teacher) LoR. I will be getting one for Stanford and all my other RD schools, but I was wondering if I would be at a disadvantage for that one school (Northeastern).",

Does this mean that it should be more about my personality and work ethic? How I act towards my coaches/teammates? I don't think a \"love for learning\" is really too appropriate here considering it's not a classroom (although learning occurs everywhere!) and at first thought, I'm assuming he will write about me as an athlete since that's the extent of our relationship.",

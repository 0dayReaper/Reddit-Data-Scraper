    "postText": "One of my goals this year is to read more (like a fuck ton more).\n\nHowever, I have an issue.\n\nI don't enjoy myself while reading. There are exceptions -- like this article: https://markmanson.net/not-giving-a-fuck -- that are just really fun to read, but even then I'm more focused on finishing the content so I can a) fulfill my goal at a faster rate b) learn what I need to learn. (EDIT: There's an error in the title, there should be no \"learn and\".)\n\nBut honestly, I can find reading very boring, even if I'm taking in stuff that I consider to be quite exciting. I'm always checking how far I am from the end and sometimes the number of pages left just overwhelm/frustrate me.\n\nI'm worried that this will eventually come in conflict with my goal to read a fuck ton, because my motivation to keep going will fall short to lack of self-discipline (or something along those lines). It already sometimes does.\n\nIs it bad that I'm sitting here reading this stuff, finding it very helpful and even being thrilled after reflection of what I just learned, but actually not enjoying the process of reading itself?",

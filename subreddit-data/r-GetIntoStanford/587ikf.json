Like Underrepresented Minority, First Generation to attend college, very low income. \n\n\n\nHow accurate are these? I've actually checked some admitsee profiles, and they look more realistic. \n\n/u/129183-stan-ps\n\n",

For example the class of 2016 had 13.3% of its class as [first-gens](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2012/september/new-student-orientation-091712.html).",

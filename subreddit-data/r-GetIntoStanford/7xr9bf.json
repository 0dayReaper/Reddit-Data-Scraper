    "postText": "Hey, so I'm a junior and I really really really want to get into Stanford. Problem is, I don't really have anything to offer. I messed up and couldn't use the opportunities I had. Now I'm feeling like my very last chance could be a perfect score on the SAT. I've been practising a lot lately and I managed to raise my score by a few hundred points. I'm in the 1400's now. So, if, theoretically speaking, I would be able to get a perfect (or near perfect/superscored perfect) score, do you think Stanford would even care? I mean I do know that standarized tests aren't as important for Stanford as they are for other top schools, and I do know that a good score on itself is not a reason for any college to admit you and that they're just for filtering out really unqualified applicants, but... do you think those nice, round numbers, along with some good essays and LORs could give me a chance? I have super medicore or even bad grades, and I don't have any achievements to show. But I don't want to give up my dream.",

Start thinking about essays and what makes you \"unique\" as well--look at it from the adcom's pov. Why should Stanford want you over someone else (with higher stats)?\n\nFigure out an answer to that question, and sell that. Work with your teachers/guidance counselor/recommenders to emphasize that particular aspect in letters of rec and essays.\n\nWith a 4.8% acceptance rate, very few people truly have a \"chance\" at Stanford, even that one kid with perfect stats and great ECs. However, I do think you can improve your situation (you might not get into stanford, but you may get into a different good school).",

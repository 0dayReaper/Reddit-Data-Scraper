    "postText": "Hello,\nI am submitting an arts supplement to Stanford. The school says that ALL application materials (except SAT scores, grades, and recs) need to be submitted along with the art supplement on December 1.\nI am doing music as a second major (and putting it as a second interest), so I am interested in these three questions:\n1)Will my entire application be reviewed earlier, or the admission office will wait until the usual RD deadline?\n2)Is there an advantage of scheduling a in-person audition, or is it OK to send a uncut video of two pieces (like the arts supplement instructions state).\n3)Would I have a substantial advantage in the process if they like my playing and I am stating Music as my second interest/major?",

You could email admissions and ask\n\n2- not sure but I'd be surprised if they penalized *at all* for doing what they suggest and sending a video - in fact I'd be shocked\nAka don't think there'd be an advantage\nIs that even an option? I don't know and I'm sure a quick Google search may prove Me wrong, but I'd be surprised it they offer this, as I know in person interviews is a massive logitistical challenge as it is\n\n3 - if they think your music is exceptional then that will help you get in. Not sure if the major choice aspect is relevant there, but I doubt it, or if it is, I'd expect it would be minor.",

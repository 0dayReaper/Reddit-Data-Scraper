You can figure this out by looking at what makes you most interested, what you seem to ask the most questions about, what you do of your own accord, what you'd want to read about in your free time, who you admire/look up to especially people that you don't know, etc. e.g. for some people this is money, for some it's attracting 'mates'/relationships, for some it's status/respect, for others it's pure curiosity, for some it's solving a specific problem in the world etc\n\n2. Follow that determination, and organize your time so you can spend as much of your time as possible following it. For me, I did no \"official\" ECs - I spent all my time following my determination, which was around making lots of money.\n\n3. If you don't know what you're determined to do, expose yourself to things - read books, biographies, travel if possible, watch documentaries for inspiration, etc. Repeat until you find something that obsesses you.\n\n4. Keep following your interests/determination. Don't do things just because other people do / they are \"important to get into college\" etc. My opinion is that over-optimizing for that is a recipe for a sad life. If Stanford doesn't fit into your determinations, then it may not make sense to try and go here. But if it does, then doing the work to get into Stanford will be easy - because you know what you're obsessed with / determined to do or get, and if Stanford is a part of that, then there's no question on if you should figure out how to get in and optimize for that, because you've already determined that you *have to*.

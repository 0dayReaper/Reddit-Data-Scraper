You'll have to know a very broad range of physics, but if you know your physics you'll do well. They aren't harder AP type questions. \n\nI recommend Barron's, which was what I used and gave me a very wide spectrum of physics",

Like the physics teacher at my school isn't even very good but it helped immensely. It does cover a lot of topics so either review fast or start soon. Barron's was alright but IMO it went into way too much detail. I ended up using the SparkNotes guide more and taking official tests from the blue book. \n\nGood luck! ",

It was close enough to predicting my score (predicted I'd get 740).\n\n&gt;How about the practice test in Barron's compared to the real one?\n\nUh not 100% positive but I thought they were a little harder but prob not by a huge amount. I didn't really use those tests\n",

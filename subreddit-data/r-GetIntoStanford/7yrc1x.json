    "postText": "So I've got a 4.0 unweighted. I have taken/plan to take most of my schools AP classes (only have 7, I'm taking 4) and my schedule this year has been half high school, half college courses. I'm planning on a 34-36 act before August. My biggest issue is my extracurriculars. I started a Model UN club at my school, I'm part of the Science club, math club, and scholars bowl club. I started an event in my local community where I invite leaders and innovators to talk about themselves and what they've done, I'm starting a Rotary INTERACT club in my District, and I just started working in a Biology lab for a graduate project. I feel like that's not a good enough lineup, and seems kinda all over the place for someone who wants to go into computer science.",

At any rate, I'm trying to get involved with some graduate projects in the computer science division.",

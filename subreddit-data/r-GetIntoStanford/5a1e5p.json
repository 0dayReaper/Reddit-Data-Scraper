            "comment": "&gt; The ACT with Writing or the SAT with Essay is required. Official scores from all test dates must be sent to Stanford directly from the ACT or the College Board (the reporting agency for the SAT) or both if the applicant has taken the ACT and the SAT. Applicants may not use the College Board's Score Choice feature or \"hide\" any scores with either testing agency.\n\nhttp://admission.stanford.edu/application/freshman/testing.html\n\nMy read is as long as you send all to stanford, then you're fine. I assume some schools don't require you to send all and that's why you don't want to list all on the commonapp?",

I think the move would be to email them and ask how they view websites -- are they only art if they are beautiful to look at, or are they art if they aren't necessarily beautiful to look at but they are highly valuable to users?\n\nMy sites that I'd built before getting into Stanford weren't \"beautiful\".\n\nI would only submit them if I thought someone would look at them who wasn't just in the art department -- e.g. if the regular readers would get to see them, as a way of showing them more who I am and what I've created. If it was just art professors seeing, I expect the comments would probably be that they aren't beautiful art.",

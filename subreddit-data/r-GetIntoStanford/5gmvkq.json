    "postText": "Be it in general conversations, interviews, presentations etc.\u2014either high stress or low stress\u2014how can one be more articulate in expressing their thoughts?\n\nRecently I was watching two great videos:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4IcGF5iTQ\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnBQmEqBCY0\n\nI found the difference between Elon and Mark's self-presentation and articulation to be astonishing. The ability to be so clear and confident in conversation/his answers is a skill I'd like to possess, but\u2014like Elon\u2014don't really have.\n\nDo you know of any resources to help with this? Thanks!",

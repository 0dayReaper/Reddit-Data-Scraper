    "postText": "I recently read this [article](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/11/2-teens-cold-call-sam-altman-become-youngest-accepted-to-y-combinator.html) and liked how the two founders met each other online. It reminded me of u/FutureFounderTrainer and his Ambitious Peers project. I'm not really one to wait, so I was wondering: is there any interest in a Discord group for the ambitious students on this sub?\n\nEDIT: here it is!

Do what interests you, what makes your story most interesting to others, etc. - there is not one generic answer that fits everyone. \n\nStanford is into creative thinking, so doing something that really augments your story and sets you apart will be ideal.",

For example, I was very interested in research so I did an independent science research project and competed at ISEF, Siemens, etc. My roommate was really into programming and interned at HP. Another friend was a musician and did some touring. There isn't one thing that suits everyone, so figure out what \"your thing\" is and do it really well.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone. I am an international student, what I am confused about is if I should Rea or RD to Stanford, I have very good ecas throughout my high school along with a coding portfolio having full-stack apps, good design apps, some Insta/twitter clones, and some very cool code-generated art projects. Some of the work is my personal projects and some are of the freelance coding gigs I have done. I believe I have strong ecas with my digital marketing startup, part of the National debate team for an international tournament, the Student government for 4 years, sports captain, founding a club, internships, organized Muns and college festivals, and some coding tournaments. But I have a 3.6 and a 3.57 in grades 11 and 12 which is not much considering Stanford. So will Stanford take me with my coding, startup, and other ecas if I apply for REA or I should go for RD, saving my ED and Ea for some other school?",

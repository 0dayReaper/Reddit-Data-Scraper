            "comment": "From the accounts I've read of people who have gotten in, pursuing anything that you're passionate about to the point that it gives you a unique perspective (something to add to the class) is \"enough\" to be impressive. Does this mean it will get you in? I don't think so, because Stanford isn't just looking for \"impressive\" achievements, they're looking for people who are a good fit, people who will add something interesting to the incoming class.\n\nI'm just another Junior though, so just consider this another perspective. Although I have read up on more accounts of people getting in, their stats, etc. more than I care to admit, nobody really knows how to get in because there isn't one set method.\n\nSo it's really cool you've founded an NGO, but make sure you're doing it out of your own interest, not just to get into Stanford. As to how you can show value, explain in your essays perhaps how it affected you, what unique perspective you can bring as a result of your experiences. Or perhaps you can use some other metric as value, e.g. amount of people helped. The most important factor, however, imo is the activity's affect on you, since you are the one who's applying.\n\nHope I helped! Perrhaps one of the people who actually got into this school could fact check me and all that on what I've said. ",

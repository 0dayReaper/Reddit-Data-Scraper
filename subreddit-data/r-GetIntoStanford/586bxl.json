    "postText": "I was reading the 50 essays that got into Harvard pdf and I noticed most of them have a similar pattern of using something personal (such as a wheel chair, or their speech patterns, etc.) as a vehicle to show their personality and their personal growth from that vehicle.\n\nDo you suggest that I use a vehicle or event from my common app essay? I will definitely use the points from the keynote exercise for the three smaller essays but I was wondering whether a vehicle or an event would fair better in the common app essay as it looks like using a vehicle works to get into Harvard.",

            "comment": "Something personal like a wheel chair or their speech patterns is the exact sort of thing that you should be including as part of your keynote exercise.\n\ne.g. if the characteristic you wanted to show was determination (an important characteristic) -- you could list as one of the examples all the things you've done to overcome your speech patterns\n\n&gt; Do you suggest that I use a vehicle or event from my common app essay?\n\nI'm not exactly sure what you mean by this. When you say vehicle, is this the same as saying \"example\"? Just want to make sure I'm on the same page and not missing something.\n\nIn summary -- the things from the keynote exercises *are* often vehicles/events, and therefore unless I'm missing or misinterpreting something -- the question is moot\n\nPlease let me know a) if I'm understanding you correctly or not and b) assuming i'm understanding you correctly, if my answer makes sense",

I'm actually applying RD and I'm still stressed about not having enough time, but then again, I'm traditionally not the best writer and will be looking to make multiple revisions. You would also want to give anyone you are asking to review you essays some time to fit it into their schedule so they do a good job rather than rush through it. Good luck! I hope we both get in!",

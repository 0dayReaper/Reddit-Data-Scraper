            "comment": "In general, the things that will be important in the future are those that were important in the past.\n\nAlmost all underlying desires have remained pretty consistent over time -- we just solve them in different ways.\n\ne.g. desire for entertainment has been always high, but solved in different ways in 1900, 1950, 2000, 2010.\n\nThough the above is about what people want. Which is not always important, depending on your perspective. (e.g. is entertainment important? depends on your perspective)\n\nImportant may be 1) things that increase human well-being 2) things that reduce the odds of humanity going extinct.\n\nThen there seem to be two general paths:\n\n1) \"Goal first\"\n\nThis looks like identifying the thing most important to you - e.g. preventing extinction of humanity for Elon - and then systematically identifying ways to address the thing/problem/vision that is important to you. (e.g. multi-planetary colonization -&gt; more space travel -&gt; cheaper space travel, less greenhouse emissions -&gt; more efficient cars -&gt; electric cars that people *want* to own / making electric cars sexy and desired)\n\n(Once selected, you may then find it useful to read a lot of history to identify ways that people have attempted in the past, and why they failed, like: http://cdixon.org/2013/08/04/the-idea-maze/)\n\n2) \"Tech first\"\n\nIdentifying areas of technology that are changing rapidly / that have new developments, and working at the cutting edge of the field, and then having an awareness of problems that you *might* want to address, should you see something that the cutting edge of the field that could help one of those problems you care about.\n\nSo, in short:\n\na) The things that are important in the future were important in the past. If you identify one of these underlying important things as something you're obsessed with solving / have to solve, then you can work on it from the perspective of that problem/thing, and search for solutions (more likely new solutions, but occasionally old solutions that others missed).\n\nb) Identify fast changing areas of technology, e.g. ML/AI, genomics/genetics, smartphones in the developing world, and work on the cutting edge and/or go deep in those fields, and then you may notice \"oh, this thing that I know about could be used to solve/do X.\"",

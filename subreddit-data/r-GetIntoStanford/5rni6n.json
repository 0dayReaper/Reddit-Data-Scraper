    "postText": "&gt; SECTION 8. REMOVING VISA HURDLES FOR STUDENTS AND OTHER TEMPORARY VISA HOLDERS.\n&gt;\n&gt; Builds a bridge from F-1 student status to Lawful Permanent Residence by:\n&gt;\n&gt; * Providing for \u201cdual intent\u201d for students, as well as O-1 (Extraordinary Ability), P (Athletes, Artists, and Entertainers) and free trade visa holders, so they are not denied visas solely on the basis that they might intend to immigrate to the United States; \n&gt;\n&gt; * Permitting experience gained on the job with the employer to count for the purposes of labor certification; and\n&gt;\n&gt; * Providing employment and travel authorization to those with approved employment-based petitions awaiting visa availability, so they have similar protections to those provided portability under the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act\n&gt;\n\nFor me, the E-3 visa is much more promising than the H-1B will ever be, but I found this super interesting passage in the new bill in the House ^ \n\nThoughts?",

I really didn't expect something like this to pass during the Trump administration but I guess life still has the ability to surprise you. However, being from a Muslim country (not on the banned list...yet), I must say I'm more worried about getting into the country as of now :(. But yeah, definitely a step forward!",

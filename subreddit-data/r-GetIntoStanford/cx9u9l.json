I was addicted to these kinds of videos when I went through the application process so I thought you guys might be interested too. \n\nMy Application: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdUMNGcz-jA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdUMNGcz-jA) \n\nMy Essays: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-s\\_Aj5ZXgr8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-s_Aj5ZXgr8) \n\nIf you have any questions about Stanford I'd be happy to answer and give my advice!

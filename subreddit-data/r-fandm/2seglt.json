Generally, just what do people do to party?\n\nThanks!",

Don't go here. I am a senior, if you have any questions please pm me.",

            "comment": "I'm a brother in a fraternity at F&amp;M. 35% of the school is enrolled in Greek Life. Most Fraternity parties are exclusively limited to Brothers and Girls, along with freshman guys for first semester. The reason being is that having someone you don't know in your house is a huge liability because they could cause numerous problems common at colleges all over the country. \n\nSo now that we've gotten Fraternity parties out of the way, there are Sports Lofts/Houses. These are a more personable setting in comparison to to the often club like atmosphere at Fraternities. Although these parties are affiliated with sports teams, they don't like to be stylized as such. They prefer calling it \" party at '640 526, etc.'\" The big loft parties are commonly affiliated with Baseball, Swimming, Soccer, Football with Rugby, Lacrosse, Track &amp; Field, and Crew participating to a lesser extent. \n\nFinally, these last few years have seen an increase in themed house and off campus house parties. Some of the themed houses available to join on campus are Theatre House, Substainability house, etc. etc.\n\nIf you're looking for weekly ragers, this isn't the school for you. As a sophomore that goes out most weekends I have only seen or heard of  8-12 Really crazy parties since my time here. This is a school of more personable parties. With fraternities maxing around 150-200 people, Lofts at 80-100, and house and themed parties at 30-40. \n\nOne good thing about this school though is its proximity to other major partying schools. If you have friends at Udel, Temple, Penn, Drexel, PSU, PSU Altoona its only an hour or so drive to all of those locations for much bigger parties. ",

If you're a guy then after your first semester the only parties you can really go to are at the Lofts or other off campus housing, unless you know a lot of the brothers in a fraternity. Partying is bigger than they tell you on the tour because there's little else to do around here.",

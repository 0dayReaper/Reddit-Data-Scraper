Why not?  \n**Link:** http://redditgifts.com/meetups/fm-meetup/\n\n\nAlright fellow fummers, let's do something fun and organize a reddit meetup. I know there are plenty of you out there, so let's do something crazy. I'll get soda and cups if someone can get cookies and games. Someone want to make fliers and make a giant reddit snoo from the resource room?\n\nPM me or post in this thread if you can make it or want to help!",

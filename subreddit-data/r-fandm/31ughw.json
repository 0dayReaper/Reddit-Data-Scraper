    "postText": "Dear Student,\n\n \n\nAttached is a sample of a letter that has been mailed to your home address. The letter that you will receive is an official notification from the College stating that your name, Social Security number, and city and state of residence were part of files that were inadvertently made publicly accessible on a College server. The files contained information for 356 current and recent F&amp;M students, most of whom are presently sophomores.\n\n \n\nIt is important to note that your data was not hacked or used for malicious intent, but due to Federal and State Identity Theft regulations, we are required to notify you of this \"data breach.\"\n\n \n\nWe are deeply sorry for this incident occurring and hope it does not cause you inconvenience. In order to help our students, here are the steps we've taken and the steps you can take, as you feel appropriate:\n\nWhat are the Next Steps?\n\nIn order for us to give our students professional assistance through this process and to ensure that we are meeting all state and federal regulations, the College has engaged Kroll, a nationally recognized firm that handles breach notifications. Kroll is equipped with expert professional staff that will help guide you and the College through next steps, should you choose to take them. They will assist with the following: \n\nThe College is required by law to formally notify you via U.S. Mail. Kroll mailed that letter today to your home address. The letter was placed in a window envelope with F&amp;M\u2019s logo in the return address. Please be sure to watch for this letter as it will reiterate various points in this email as well as give you important contact information.\n\nThe College is proactively offering each impacted person the option to obtain free credit-monitoring services for one year. Kroll will assist you with establishing your account to obtain those services if you choose to elect them. \n\nKroll has established a professionally staffed Call Center on behalf of F&amp;M to assist with questions and concerns. The contact number is 1-866-775-4209, and professionals licensed and trained to help in circumstances such as these -- who have been briefed about the F&amp;M incident -- are available from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Central Time), Monday through Friday to speak with you.  We encourage you to contact them for any assistance or guidance you may need.\nThe College has also proactively noted this incident on your student ID in Banner, the student information system used by many administrative offices such as Financial Aid, Payroll, the Registrar, and Business Office, and others. This will serve as an alert to College personnel in the unlikely case of an unauthorized person trying to access your data. As always, please be sure to have your F&amp;M student ID available as proof of your identity when conducting business with these offices.\n\n \n\nWhat is the College doing about preventing this in the future?\nRegrettably, we live in an era when it is probably not possible to completely eliminate data breach risks, as evidenced by the many massive breaches of data recently experienced by major retailers and financial institutions across the country. Identify Theft Crime is constantly evolving and changing and cyber security experts tell us to inform ourselves about the risks and take steps to minimize them.\n\nThis incident has underscored the importance of our focused work on information security to develop policies, provide training, and implement tools and best business practices to better secure data -- both paper and electronic -- across campus. Part of this ongoing work has been the formation of an information security working group, which is contributing to the overall efforts of F&amp;M's Enterprise Risk Management team. This incident is a strong reminder that we need to remain diligent in that commitment and continue to plan accordingly.\n\nAgain, we regret and apologize for any inconvenience or concern that this incident may have caused you. Please know that the security of personal information entrusted to us remains a top priority of Franklin &amp; Marshall College. If you have further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.\n\nThank you.\n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nWendy Starner\nAssociate Vice President for Finance and College Risk Manager\n\n \n\nEric Smith\n\nChief Information Security Officer\n",

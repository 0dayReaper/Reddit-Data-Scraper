    "postText": "Is any other alumni or student getting calls from 717-385-4632? Every time i pick up they hang up. It seems like one of those phone scams but its actually the college? \n\nMaybe its because I never responded to their annoying ass follow up calls after I graduated to tell them where I was after college?\n\nEither way fuck this school. I looked the number up on google and other people are getting the same calls:\n\nhttps://800notes.com/Phone.aspx/1-717-358-4632",

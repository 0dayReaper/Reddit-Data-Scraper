    "postText": "F&amp;M looks like a fantastic fit for me, but I\u2019d like to hear some of your favorite and least favorite things about the school. Does it\u2019s relatively small size get in the way of social gatherings and making friends? How are the parties? (if they exist) especially, I\u2019d like to know how the computer science program is if there are any CS students here. I\u2019ve seen that they typically only hand out ~20 CS degrees, does that mean the classes will have only about 20 students? I\u2019ve also heard the CS classes are predominantly male, what kind of classroom environment is created by those factors. How is the instruction? I feel I should be cautious taking CS at a liberal arts college but F&amp;M really strikes me as a hidden gem. Any experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated, and will help me make application decisions.",

Profs are ehh but they aren't the worst. If youre desperate for liberal arts then sure fandm is probably a good choice but otherwise, keep searching.",

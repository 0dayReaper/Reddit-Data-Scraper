People show up to stuff like your events, meetings, etc... What's the climate like in sense of inclusivism/race?\n\nDo you like the staff you interact with (non-faculty)? Are they approachable?  What do you think are the best offices on campus in regards to leadership opportunities/feeling valued?\n\nfigured i'd try here, even though the last post was a few months ago.\n\n",

            "comment": "The student body is, for the most part, highly motivated and goal oriented. I am part of EMS on campus and many people don't come to our meetings because they are mostly for members and those interested in joining. Since our group is a part of the Department of Public Safety, we usually share events with them. Most organizations and clubs are inclusive of everyone who wants to be a part of said organizations and clubs. The climate in regards to race,I feel, is less tense than the administration thinks it is. I like the interaction between staff and students, as that was part of why I came to F&amp;M. I think the office of student and post graduate development is a good place to start for opportunities. But, students should look into what they are interested in, because, usually there is a group for it and that group can give them more specific opportunities.",

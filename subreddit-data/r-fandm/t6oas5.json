The administration only cares about taking students money and does not support students, and if anything promotes and encourages harm to students. Go literally anywhere else but stay as far as humanly possible from this sorry excuse for an educational institution. Source: am an alum",

Go here if you're going to go to office hours regularly and care about having an invovled relationship with profs. Professors will go out of their way to meet with you if you show the littlest interest. The school's modo is \"involve me and I learn\" and that has overwhelmingly been my experience. Also the 3+2 dual degree program is awesome.",

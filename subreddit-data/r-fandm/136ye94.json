    "postText": "So I've heard a lot about F&amp;M suffering grade deflation. As someone with an interest in grad school this is somewhat worrying. Can anyone speak to the severity of grade deflation and if F&amp;M is a good choice for someone looking at grad school (or particularly med school)?",

If anything, there is significant grade _inflation_. Regardless, and unfortunately, med schools probably care about your MCATs a lot more than your grades as long as you're passing and taking the standard prereqs.",

            "comment": "I disagree with the previous comment, especially for STEM. The professors in the science departments enjoy making their classes challenging to prepare students for grad school/health professions. So while it is possible to get an A or A- in most of your STEM classes, it can be incredibly taxing, especially if you want to pursue other activities or work while taking 4 classes. Honestly though, this has been my friends\u2019 experience with STEM across multiple schools. STEM as a discipline heavily grade deflates, so yes, while it happens at F&amp;M, it\u2019s not unique to F&amp;M and happens at many other places. \n\nGraduating as a pre-med student myself, the best advice I have is to stop worrying about grade deflation and try your best. I know it seems like trite advice, but med schools care way more about your growth over time and how interesting the story is that you tell for why you want to go into medicine",

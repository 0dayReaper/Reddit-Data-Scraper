In a recently completed study on grading during the 2012-13 academic year for 24 institutions (most of which are US News top 50 national liberal arts colleges), Franklin &amp; Marshall's Spring 2013 average GPA (3.09) was the second lowest; the group average was 3.33. At Franklin &amp; Marshall, 34.4% of grades awarded during academic year 2012-13 were A or A-, the lowest percentage of the institutions in the study (where the group average was 46.7%).",

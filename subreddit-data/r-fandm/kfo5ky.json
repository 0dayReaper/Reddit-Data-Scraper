    "postText": "Hello everyone! Ik this sub is kinda dead, but I\u2019m considering going to F&amp;m so I am curious about a few things:\n\n1. How does F&amp;m place for Law school/mba admissions?\n2. Is the grade deflation really bad? I am trying to go to graduate school after so that is important to me.\n3. How is the alumni network, especially in realms of finance and law?\n4. What is the party scene like?\n5. How easily accessible are internships research opportunities?\n\nThank you so much! I hope someone responds \ud83d\ude02",

The glory days of F&amp;m social life ended about 4 years ago. There are things to do, but not massive parties with open invites. Covid social life is dead. School is overly involved in Greek life and it really fucked the social scene.\n\n\n\n\nEveryone who goes to F&amp;M hates f&amp;m and loves it at the same time. You\u2019ll have fun, but if ur looking for craziness go to penn state",

Although based on my grad school experience fandm just doesn't grade inflate like other places. You actually get what you deserve. It's not impossible to get good grades but you need to deserve them, truly.",

The economics department is tough but fair, I got As in the 2 economics classes I took, although I had to work for it. There's definitely not an official policy of only so many people can get a certain grade, but they're cool with giving half a class C's if that's what they deserve.\n\nWhat I would say is you should think about whether you're willing and able to work that hard. If you are you'll learn and you'll be better for it. Every department will be rigorous on grading any written assignment... So if writing is not one of your strong-suits no matter what you major in, you're gonna have a bad time. Economics and the classics are both social sciences so they're both writing heavy.",

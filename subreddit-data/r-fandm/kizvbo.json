I\u2019m not sure what other types of aid F&amp;M can offer, but I know that they don\u2019t offer merit scholarships. Just something to keep in mind about the cost! \nAlso, F&amp;M only offers Bachelor of Arts degrees, no Bachelor of Science.",

I'm considering applying, and the only major that looked worthwhile for me was also CS, but it seems like going to a very small college without a huge profile in CS (ranked various places as over #500, or even #1319 one place), may not be worth it?",

However if you do get in it\u2019s super great. When I was there, since I was receiving financial aid I didn\u2019t pay health insurance fees and got free private piano lessons. It was a tremendous amount of help for me as an international student.",

And does this mean the college paid for it or is the health insurance just gone?\n\nAnd how did you get free private lessons? Did you study a music major/minor or was it just a hobby?",

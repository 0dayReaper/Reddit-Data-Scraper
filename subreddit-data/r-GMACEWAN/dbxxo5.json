    "postText": "I applied for the winter 2020 semester for a Bachelor of Arts, and got waitlisted. I waited til the last minute to apply (literally applied September 30. I know a very dumb mistake) and was wondering how much of a chance of getting in I have. I knows it\u2019s probably a very slim chance of me getting accepted just because I applied last minute, but is there any hope of me getting in?",

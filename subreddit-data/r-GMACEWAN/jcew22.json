    "postText": "i accepted my macewan offer and signed up for classes and then i got into the uofa so i accepted my offer there and decided thats where i would attend. For BsN program at macewan you had to give in the police information check thingy as a condition to keep your acceptence, which i never did and so i thought that they'd dropped me as a student there. But they now emailed me saying i owe 3000 in tuition?? After sending in my exception request form they moved it down to 500. I never attended any classes there and now have logged on and dropped everything. Has this happened to anyone before? what did you do? what happens if i dont pay the 500?",

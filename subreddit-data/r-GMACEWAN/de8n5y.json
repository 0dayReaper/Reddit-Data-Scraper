    "postText": "I don\u2019t think that I would be accepted to start computer science next year as I have been told that they already have a wait list and my high school marks weren\u2019t that great. If I started a different science major next year would it be possible to do this for a year and then transfer into computer science? \n\nI got great marks in college but they don\u2019t transfer to university. I know I am capable of getting good marks because I will be focused and try my hardest and so I am wondering if I did get accepted into a different major for the 2020 school year if I could use the marks from this major to gain acceptance into computer science not next year but the year after.",

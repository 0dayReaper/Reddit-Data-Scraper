            "comment": "Hey! I would HIGHLY recommend CYC. It has been life changing and is such a beautiful program. However, I would say that it is a very emotional program and requires a lot of emotional energy. It also covers some difficult topics, so it\u2019s important to make sure that you\u2019re taking care of yourself and ready to learn about hard things. Not to scare you of course, and I would definitely recommend reading up on Child and Youth Care. There are a couple Facebook pages for MacEwan CYC to check out and we have a page on the MacEwan website. The program does have a high employment rate after and there are lots of jobs in the field!",

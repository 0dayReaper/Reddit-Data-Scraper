A lot of people who do frats/sororities just seem superficial to me. Also how is the diversity?  I c\u00f4me from a very diverse HS so I would like my college to be diverse as well.",

You can make friends with your hosuemates if you live in campus residence halls, but most people you meet will be involved in greek life. There's pretty much parties everyday. And while they are great fun.... if you're not interested in that, then i'm not sure if it's the greatest fit for you.",

Everyone else is pretty much normal. It's basically like joining a club not like your average sorority girl house. I didn't think I wanted to join a sorority at all, but its truly a lot different than at other schools. It still sucks tho lol",

It's going to be rough at times. It's going to be toxic sometimes. That's how it is living with 50 other people in one house. It's not as secluded as in the dorms. \n\nIf it helps, DePauw gave me some of the best tools to help myself be successful for the future. There's so many opportunities... you just..  have to be willing to go and use them and take them. \n\nGreek life isn't for everyone, but its also really beneficial to so many people. It wasn't the right decision for me ultimately, but it lead me to a great community. I dont regret it but if I had the chance to do it all over, I probably wouldn't. Greek life also gave me a lot of leadership opportunities. \n\nDepauw is truly a great school with so many opportunities. Greek life can be brutal, true, but you just have to learn how to deal with it.",

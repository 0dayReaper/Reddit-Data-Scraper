    "postText": "Greetings everyone,\n\nI'm an international student currently in a gap year planning to apply to Depauw University for fall 2022 as a CS major. I had a few questions about the university and would appreciate it if anybody could answer those. \n\n1) How's the CS program there? What are the professors like? The grad school placements and internships?\n\n2) How's the international student life? The diversity on campus? Is Greek life dominant? Does Greek life affect the social life of those not in greek life?\n\n3) Is it worth applying to and enroll in the Honors Program?",

            "comment": "The CS program at DePauw is completely trash. The reasons being\n1) Horrible courses; the CS courses offered at DePauw don't prepare you for what you'll see when you actually get into the job market\n2) There are only a couple of good CS professors at DePauw, you'll have to work by yourself most of the time teaching the material to yourself\n3) The content of the classes offered at DePauw is subpar/easy and there is very little amount of coding that you actually do. \n\nI'd suggest if you really want to do CS then do the 3-2 pre engineering program that DePauw offers. You basically spend 3 years at DePauw then 2 years at an affiliate institute. DePauw has affiliations with 3 universities which are \n1) Washington University in St Louis\n2) Case Western Reserve \n3) Columbia university\n\nYou need to have a 3.2 GPA and a minimum B in all your science classes and your guaranteed admission into WashU and Case Western. Columbia is a bit harder to get into. \n\nI did the 3-2 program and will be going to WashU this fall to do a bachelor's in CS. I'd highly recommend doing the Pre engineering program if you really want to do CS and DePauw is your only option. Doing CS from DePauw is a waste of time and money. Heck just look at DePauws CS curriculum and then compare it with WashU's you'll have your answer https://www.depauw.edu/academics/departments-programs/computer-science/courses-2/courses/ \nhttps://courses.wustl.edu/CourseInfo.aspx?sem=SP2021&amp;sch=E&amp;dept=E81\n\nPS: The information on the 3-2 pre engineering program can be easily found on DePauws website",

            "comment": "Hello! I\u2019m currently a junior at DP :) \nI\u2019ve heard that the CP department is good and the professors are liked. I\u2019m not very comfortable commenting on the diversity on campus considering I\u2019m a white student born nearby, but from what I can tell there are are many programs committed to inclusivity and I know many international students. From what I can tell, we have a lot of international students they seem happy. \nGreek life is very prominent, but easy to not be involved in. I am not affiliated with Greek life and choose not to be. I\u2019ve never had an issue or been pressured. I\u2019m currently an Honors Scholar and I do see the appeal, but personally I am regretting it as do many other students that enroll in it. It\u2019s not awful, but can be restrictive. I think it\u2019s worth looking into and can be great for some people, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it.",

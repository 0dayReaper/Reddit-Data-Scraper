Couldn't get an official tour scheduled, but I would love for the students to talk to a student and maybe get show around. Any help appreciated!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan provide a gift card for your time. (Know it's a weird request but just want to make sure my students get the most they can from this visit)",

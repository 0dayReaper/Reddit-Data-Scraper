    "postText": "I got accepted RD to DePauw and was given a financial aid offer of \n\n$30k scholarship  \n$12k grant  \n$2.5k campus employment  \ntotal- $44.5k/yr\n\nI emailed them asking for more (since they did not meet my EFC) and I explained my situation, and they gave me an additional $2k institutional loan (they mentioned that this is by far the highest package they gave this year) which I don't think is true. \n\nso,  \n1) I saw a lot of you emailed asking for more aid, what did you get- a loan, additional grant, etc? and at what amount? \n\n2) does an institutional loan have to be repaid after graduation? how many months after graduation? Is there any interest?",

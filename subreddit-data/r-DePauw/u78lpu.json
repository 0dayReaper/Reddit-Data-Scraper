The post office is also often hiring and internship opportunities open up all the time. There are also opportunities for paid positions in community service organization. It all depends on how selective you are and how much work you put into the application to get your preferred position on campus. I wouldn't worry about it too much, I've literally never seen an international student struggle to land on-campus employment.",

            "comment": "I am also an international student. Our main thing to keep in mind is that we are only allowed to work 20 hours a week. Wages are $7.25 an hour up to $10/hour. Working at $10/hour x 20 hours x 52 weeks = roughly 10k. Also, most student employment (80%) do not start at $10/hour rates and typically start at $7.25/hour and scale up. Working as a tutor at the academic resource center and as a Hillman intern would allow your wage to scale like this. \n\nHillman interns work about 10 hours a week, but their work also includes a class you have to attend that might count for your GPA and you must go through an application process similar to applying to a fellows program. Working as a tutor (quantitative reasoning/writing/speaking, not as a a STEM or course guide) also requires you to take a class to train yourself for the job, which spans an entire semester. It also requires an application process. \n\nIf you stay on-campus during the summer, the pay structure is different since you can work full-time as opposed to part-time in the school year. Summer employment is less guaranteed than during the school year, so I wouldn't count on it. The notable options for summer employment are with research in the sciences, working at the campus farm or for the admissions office.",

It's probably closer to like 6-10 hours a week for most students. Also, obviously you are not going to be working 52 weeks a year due to breaks, finals, other commitments, etc. Hence, your income is going to be much lower.\n\nI can't stress this enough, as an international student I would not put serious consideration into \"working\" my way through my tuition. You are not going to be working that many hours and be able to maintain your grades and sanity at the same time.",

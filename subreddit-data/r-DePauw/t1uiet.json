    "postText": "I applied EA but didn't hear from them until way past the deadline, when they sent me an email with financial aid offer but no status update on the portal. They also said that I have to \"confirm my admission\" by March 1st, while the enrollment deposit deadline is May 1st. \n\nDoes anyone else get the same email? Also, does \"confirming admission\" mean committing to the school?",

EVER! \ud83d\udc80 I've sent mails to 2 people involved in international admissions and even to admission@depauw.edu\nBut no one replies \ud83d\udc80 Neither to the months old emails, nor to the recent ones. Can any of y'all help me out here? I mean what's the point of sending a bot email with a whole paragraph on \"Don't forget to contact us for *any* help\" if you ain't gon reply bruh\ud83d\udc80.",

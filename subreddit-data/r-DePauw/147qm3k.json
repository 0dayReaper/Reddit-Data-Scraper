If you want to look at major requirements/courses in the department you can look here. [https://www.depauw.edu/academics/departments-programs/computer-science/majors-minors/](https://www.depauw.edu/academics/departments-programs/computer-science/majors-minors/) you can also find all the faculty and other resources for students (like student awards, senior projects, what kind of software they use and student organizations like the robotics club and more).\n\nFor job prospect, again I can't really speak to computer science specially, but there are always a shit ton of events for all types of majors. This website is one for jobs/internships/graduate schools/etc... for comp sci majors [https://www.depauw.edu/academics/departments-programs/computer-science/for-students/jobs-resources/](https://www.depauw.edu/academics/departments-programs/computer-science/for-students/jobs-resources/) . A lot of them are general search engines like Indeed or AfterCollege but there are some in there that are tailored to just computer science opportunities. Hope this helps!",

Most classes are studying and understanding by yourself but also you have to learn A LOT by yourself outside of class. You'll have to work 10x harder than kids at renowned colleges because people don't even know of Depauw, which makes it harder to get jobs. Grinding leetcode is also a must since there's no advanced DSA class. Clubs are all monopoly and the only way is to suck up to people who are on the exec board, faculty has no power and is absolutely unbothered when it comes to that, so you'll likely have to look for opportunities outside. People are helpful and supportive but you really need to find those people, not everyone is your friend even when it seems like it.",

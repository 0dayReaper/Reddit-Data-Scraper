    "postText": "Hey guys, I\u2019m an international prospective student who got accepted to DePauw this Fall with a generous financial aid package. However, my family suddenly suffered from an incident which greatly affects our financial standings and my parents can\u2019t afford my education at DePauw anymore. Therefore, to be able to attend DePauw, I want to apply for the full-tuition scholarship (Bonner Scholarship or Prindle Institute Ethics Scholarship). But their application deadline is February 1st and today is February 21th. Should I still apply for the scholarship and write an email to explain my special circumstance? Has anyone had the same experience and was your application accepted by DePauw?",

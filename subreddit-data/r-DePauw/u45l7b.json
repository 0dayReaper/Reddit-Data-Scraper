    "postText": "Basically, I am an international student who really wants to go to Depauw for comp science. Depauw has given me a generous amount of aid ($52.5k with a 2k loan and 2.5k employment) but my parents' contribution is very low so I might be forced to take a loan of $50k for 4 years. Most of this loan is for the room and board fee so I was wondering if it's worth taking a 50k private loan? Besides, should I even take a loan for room and board or will I be able to manage it with the help of additional student employment (smthng like the first year resident assistant)?",

            "comment": "If your wanting to do CS, I'm afraid DePauw really isn't the place for it. By no means is DePauw a 'bad school'. DePauw is a very decent liberal arts college, however the CS curriculum at DePauw is just not up to par with any decent CS school. However that doesn't mean that you can't get into those fancy tech companies if your doing CS from DePauw. I know a couple of people this year that got into apple and Amazon. However they got into those companies cause of there own determination and skills which they most like had learned outside of there classroom.\n\nApart from this, personally I wouldn't take a 50K loan for 4 years that's a bit too much as the quality of CS education that you'll get from DePauw will never compensate the loan you take out.\n\n However, again let me reiterate, if you on your own are determined to do well in life, and actually make a difference then no matter which school you go to everything will work out for you. You just would have to work 2 times more hard outside of classes and learn new skills/do interview preps on your own cuz sadly DePauw won't prepare you for that. \n\nAnother point to consider as well is that the US is truly the land of opportunity. Even though DePauw doesn't have a great CS program finding an internship I wouldn't say would be easy but since there is so much demand for software engineers, you'll eventually get one if you prepare well enough for interviews. Job prospects in the US for CS are very bright, and the pay is really good. So you could potentially pay back your loan in 2-3 years after you graduate. \n\nRegarding work study, I don't think you'll make that much money that you'll be able to also sponsor your own education with that. That money honestly will most likely be spent on personal expenses. The minimum wage in Indiana is just under 8$ I think. An international student can only work 20 hours per week and only on CAMPUS. So including both semesters you'll probably be making just around 2K$ which is barely enough to meet personal expenses in this day and age. \n\n\n Hopefully this was helpful. Feel free to dm me if you have any more questions!",

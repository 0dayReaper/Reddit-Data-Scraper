    "postText": "  \n\n**:** I am on a task-force of a university that is looking into making our campus a tobacco-free campus, including vaping. The DePauw website says that smoking is prohibited on campus. Is DePauw truly tobacco-free? Is compliance high? I'm just looking for input and feedback from people who are actually there, day-to-day. Thank you!",

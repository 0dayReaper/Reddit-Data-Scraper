    "postText": "Hi guys, I'm an international prospective student that got accepted to Depauw with a very generous scholarship package. I also got accepted to other liberal arts colleges that are higher ranked than Depauw but with less aid and scholarships. My parents insisted that I should choose the best-ranked school and that they could afford it. But I want to save up money to ultimately attend graduate school. What do you think I should do? Do you guys think Depauw is a great school?",

We\u2019re known for pretty expansive study abroad opportunities, internships, etc. We have a ton of international students, if you are interested in finding people in the same boat as you. Personally, I like it here, but financial aid was my priority (and DePauw delivered). Feel free to PM me with questions (this subreddit isn\u2019t really active).",

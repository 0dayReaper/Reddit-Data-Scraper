    "postText": "i didn\u2019t know there were people actually using this thread! as a senior, here\u2019s my best advice for any freshman preparing to arrive to campus in the next few weeks. any upperclassmen pls feel free to add on!\n\n1. those \u201cwhat i brought to college\u201d videos are not lying to you: you do NOT need as much shit as you might think. if you\u2019re on the fence about bringing something, leave it at home. you do need flip flops and a robe, though. showering in a shared bathroom is kinda hard to get used to.\n\n2. greek life is a big part of campus. however, i need you to remember that it is NOT the end of the world (nor is it the only thing to do on campus). you can rush in january if you\u2019re interested, but please don\u2019t worry too much about it. i wasted a LOT of tears over recruitment, and it ended up not being a big deal at all. i, as a non-sorority woman, have friends in literally every greek house (and lots of independent friends as well).  you will be okay!! just don\u2019t sweat it. :-)\n\n3. depauw yikyak is very active. it\u2019s completely full of shit. i have yet to see a single real party be announced on there. you can download it if you want, but PLEASE don\u2019t believe a single post. in fact, if someone tells you a rumor, your first reaction should be \u201cdid you hear that on yikyak? \ud83e\udd28\u201d\n\n4. my biggest advice: just ask! do you want to study abroad? do you want to know what parties are this weekend? do you want a job? do you hate a class and need to change? ASK!! your professor, your advisor, your roommate, the upperclassman next to you in class, the person in front of you in line at Hoover\u2014 we will all be willing to help you. if we don\u2019t know the answer, we know someone who will. college is a game of who-do-you-know, and the best way to get in the know is to ask!\n\ngood luck tigers! see you in august :-)\n\nif you have any questions you don\u2019t want to post, feel free to dm me!",

And it\u2019s all happening October 30 in downtown Indy.\n \nAs a major highlight of this event, INDY REDEFINED will feature a Hackathon. This hackathon will offer 10 people the chance to create a new technology-based resourced, designed to draw more young adults to live and work in Indianapolis. They will have just 24 hours to complete this task!\n \nThe winner will be chosen through audience voting and a panel of judges and will be featured by Downtown Indy, promoted through their website, featured on social media and use to connect downtown residents/visitors to Indianapolis experiences.\n\nIP is owned by the Hacker, Downtown Indy will just be a promotional avenue.  \n \nApplications for the hackathon are now live and will close on October 15th.\n \nhttp://www.indyredefined.com/hackathon/",

That being said, if you're a trans, gay or person of color, you'll likely stick out in rural Indiana. But not at DePauw. DePauw is a small enclave of liberalism with a more diverse population than the town. \n\nHave there been racist incidents at DePauw involving townies? I believe several years ago. But all in all I think campus is pretty safe. \n\nCommunications is a great major at DePauw.",

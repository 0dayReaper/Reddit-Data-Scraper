I've received no communication from their end, not even about any \"accepted students session,\" nothing. I was told I should apply for the media fellows program and that was the last email I got from them ( Jan 31st) After which, I did follow up multiple times but have had no response.\nDo I consider this a rejection?What should i do because i was really looking forward to attending depauw",

It might be that there are delays on their regular decision round. Better email your counselor instead of the admission office. Good luck mate \ud83d\udc2f\ud83d\udc9b",

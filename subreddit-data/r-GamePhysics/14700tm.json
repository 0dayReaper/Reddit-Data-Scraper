The RTS is a fun single playthrough campaign, that dripfeeds new mechanics/units at a nice pacr but not something you'd stick around long-term. The team based shooter/wave defense is a lot of fun but kinda bare bones in current early access. (Core gameplay is great but only 2 mission types, all on same map, although big map that uses some random locations) \n\nIf you have disposable income I'd say go for both of them.\n\nIf you can only buy a few games a year maybe skip them/keep an eye on Extermination (the shooter) as early access develops.",

Definitely some design issues (like the non-existent in-mission saves), but it really is great. It even looks like folks are modding Terran Command to remake STTA!\n\nThere was also a rather underrated FPS simply named [Starship Troopers released in 2005](https://starshiptroopers.fandom.com/wiki/Starship_Troopers_(2005_video_game)).

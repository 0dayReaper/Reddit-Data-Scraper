The ship itself was one huge physics object, which moved based on a dynamic wave simulation they were running in the ocean. This big physics object was covered in a bunch of smaller physics objects that would move around the ship. They were able to have the player and NPCs moving around the ship and climbing on everything, and the NPC AI was able to pathfind around the moving objects and even use them as cover, leading to really dynamic fights as different crates and containers moved randomly around the deck. \n\nAt first glance it looks fairly simple, but the huge number of moving parts and the way that it all just works without glitching and sending everything flying is really impressive. They had a lot of trouble just getting NPCs to walk convincingly around a moving train in Uncharted 2, so the ship was a huge step forward. \n\n[Here's a video with one of the programmers explaining how they did it](https://youtu.be/4ZFtP8LbUYc) skip to 1:04:50 for the ship part, but the whole thing is very good.",

A few hours after that my mind was blown away by the train sequence. \n\nNothing else that I had played up until that point had felt like that. Other PS3 games had pretty graphics, but Uncharted 2 was the first one that felt truly \"next-gen\" from a gameplay perspective too. \n\nI can't think of any other studio that have had a run of such technically brilliant games like they have. Their programmers deserve all the praise in the world.",

The player has no freedom so they can do insane things because the entire map can be designed around that insane thing. They don't have to worry about insane thing A interacting with insane thing B because they will never be present at the same time.\n\nMost games start with building the core systems, then environments are created to play in with those systems. Most of Naughty Dog's games are the opposite, with very bare-bones core systems and environments designed on their own with bespoke systems.\n\nIn the wire physics clip, for example, I don't see a single physics object within the area the player can reach with that cable, which means they don't have to worry about dynamic interactions with anything other than the player. They likely have an entire collision mesh setup for just the area that the cable can reach to use with it since it needs far more detail than pretty much anything else.",

You're right in the sense that a naughty dog game is never going to be confused for, say, a Bethesda game, but they really opened up this game in terms of their \"wide-linear\" approach, and I think it's a great one for the type of game they're trying to make.",

Its very similar but a lot more immersive with how you can interact with the world.\n\nWhich is what suprises me with all the negativity, it plays very similar to the first so if they enjoyed it how is this \"the worst game ever!\"?. I think the gun fights also feel way more impactful, when I get hit, ellie staggers and can fall to the ground crawling away as you shoot. It's really immersive. \n\nI'm not to far in the game but anyone complaining about the story doesnt realise the last of us world is really really violent, so why shouldnt the sequel not be as violent",

There are legitimate criticisms of this game that people are sidestepping because of these types of negative reviews which have, from what I've seen, by far been in the minority. I'm worried that Naughty Dog will just brush it off and not actually listen to how angry and frustrated the fans are because they can chalk up all the negatives to angsty gamer bois",

                                    "comment": "You've touched on an interesting debate in programming language design!\n\nThe short answer is that, in C++ (the language used for almost all video game engines), no, the programmer has to explicitly check that they're not reading or writing past the end of an array.\n\nThe reason for this is two-fold: first, because an array is far more abstract than the primitives provided by the hardware or operating system, the only way to check is to, y'know, *check*, and making that check is slow (relatively speaking). Since it's often possible for the programmer to know that they're not violating array bounds *without* checking, making the check optional allows for maximum performance\u2014something which game engines prioritize over almost everything else.\n\n(Of course, as in this hypothetical bug, programmers *very very frequently* fail to check when an out-of-bounds access *is* possible, so *most* languages now just do the bounds check automatically and eat the performance hit. C and C++ are the major exceptions I'm aware of.)\n\nSecond, in C and C++, the language *doesn't actually keep track of the length of an array* for you. If you're not going to just know, you need to store it elsewhere. Again, this is because the programmer may be able to just know the length of the array, and the language can save a few bytes in that case (somewhat relevant in the '70s when C was created\u2014somewhat less relevant now). And, as with the bounds check, this causes enough issues that almost all other languages track array length automatically.",

The game unloads the bob-omb actor because it exploded, but it still remembers that mario is supposed to hold something. And now if you walk around a little, new entities will load into the same memory spot as the bob-omb used to be, so now mario will be holding a sign or a box or something, depending on what entity populated that memory adress.\n\nIn this case, the game probably unloaded Spiderman for a cutscene or something, but never loaded the Spiderman entity again once the cutscene was over. Then the game started populating the memory adress with items and scenery found in the game, because hey there's a free memory spot here. \n\nI could be completely wrong though, it's just my theory.",

World objects need to be loaded based on their distance/LOD to the camera, but the player mesh is always visible. There's no need to unload it just because you're playing a cinematic or anything that requires taking away control from the player.\n\nEDIT:\n\n&gt; but a bug in the object loading system, where its called for the wrong asset mesh for the model\n\nThis sort of bugs usually happen when the \"slot\" used by the object is re-used for another object, which was unloaded and then re-used for some reaon. So technically, it is a memory management bug. It doesn't matter if it happens at mesh load time, or at object-sort time or any other time. The cause is always the same: the wrong mesh is used. However, the main cause is simply a synchronization bug. Important meshes like the player mesh should be managed in sync with player input and cinematic system. The simple way around having to synchronize all the different systems is to just not unload the mesh when it doesn't need to be unloaded.",

The game really differs in Miles' gameplay and his attacks that the original spidey didn't have.  But the game is also available on ps4.

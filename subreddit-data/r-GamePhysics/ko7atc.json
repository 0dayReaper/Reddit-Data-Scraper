The game BONEWORKS has MUCH better locomotion and it came out a while before HL:A, but that type of \"free\" locomotion is hard for a lot of people to do because it's easy to get dizzy if you're not experienced or don't have a tolerance. I tried playing BONEWORKS again after about a year break and even though I made it through the whole thing last time with no sickness, I got sick almost immediately cuz I hadn't played any VR in months.",

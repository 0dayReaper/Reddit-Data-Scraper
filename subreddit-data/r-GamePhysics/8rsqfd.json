More modern games facial animation still looks like garbage compared to that.\n\nBut IMO one of the flaws of the source engine is how 'flat' everything often looks. Not sure how else to put it. A brick wall doesn't look like a brick wall to me, it looks like the most smooth wall ever with brick wallpaper put over it. Same with floor tiles, and also.. the water. Flat as newly paved road. And everything is so 'sharp'..\n\nModern titles with the source engine definitely improved on this, but it still seems like a weakness of the engine in general.",

In its pure form it may be called tritium oxide (T2O or 3H2O) or super-heavy water. Pure T2O is corrosive due to self-radiolysis. Diluted, tritiated water is mainly H2O plus some HTO (3HOH).\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/GamePhysics/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

The first time I actually sat down to try to play it that way I saw like, everything I missed fucking around the first 50 times.  ",

It played fine actually but levels would take minutes to load.

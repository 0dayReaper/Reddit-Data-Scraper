I once downloaded it but I don\u2019t get it, is it a multiplayer, because when I played it alone it made zero sense to me\u2026\n\nIs it funnier with friends, because I have no gamer ones. Literally. The few people I hang out with only share photography as a hobby, or drone flying (that\u2019s literally the few hobbies getting me to go out and talk to people.)\n\nCan anyone help me out here and tell me how this is supposed to be played? Because it kinda looks so cool in the videos,  but I can\u2019t get into it myself",

It\u2019s one of those games that let me forget time, when I quit for the day I noticed I played 4 hours straight (which is very much considering my usual gaming times, which are an hour or so on fps or casual games)",

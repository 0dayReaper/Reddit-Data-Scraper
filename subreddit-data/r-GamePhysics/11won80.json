I don't know if it's just the nostalgia of being a kid coming out of the sewers that first time imprinted on my mind but the sunset/night sky and the environment still kind of give me some pause. Someone said once that it's the fantasy world rich color palette and the kind of ethereal glow on everything that makes it still sort of somehow look nice despite the game's considerable age/bad graphics and lends it a chill, charming vibe. I agree with that. \n\nEvery time I start a new playthrough I still have that feeling just a tiny bit when I leave the sewers, which is impressive as hell considering some of the most beautiful, technically impressive, vast open world recent RPGs I've played often lose that sense of wonder IMO after the first playthrough, if they even have it to begin with. I consciously *know* that I've explored almost everything and I know all the quests and the story and yet for some reason my brain still kinda goes \"there could be so much *out there* to explore!\"",

Just standing around in a forest listening to a calm song in the soundtrack, hearing the ambient sounds, maybe the glisten of an Ayleid well or the ring of some Nirnroot near a river, deer or rabbits darting by in the distance. Just the epitome of pastoral beauty",

Yeah it can get repetitive, but it fits the game well.\n\nNot to mention the memes are definitely enhanced by Harvest Dawn and the various town BGM. That part was not intentional, but it's another reason I hold Oblivion dear.",

I made a save before recording this in case I could mess around and the body just stayed perfectly still, only reacting to the grab prompt (which I did here) or a weapon swing. In either case every time it spaghettified and flew away.\n\nThe spaghettification bugs happened for me on the old 30fps 360 version I played too so I don't think it's caused by higher FPS.",

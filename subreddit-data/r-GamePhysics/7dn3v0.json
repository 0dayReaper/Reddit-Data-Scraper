I gave him that nickname because of how quick he is in bed but he totally misinterpreted it as a compliment and now he calls everybody in our group that. All I want to do is kill deathclaws but he wants to \u201csave the commonwealth.\u201d The real problem is those damned deathclaws! Anyway, the other day, I found something... well someone, new. \n\nYou see, I was out doing Atom\u2019s work, and killing deathclaws and what not when I stubbled on some crappy maze. Well, I found a way out and came across a guy named Gage. Let me tell you, Gage is the exact opposite of Preston, and he\u2019s so much more exciting. I just don\u2019t know what to do with Preston. I wonder if this is how Piper felt that night...",

The little victory 'cutscene' was him riding away, immediately losing control sideways, falling into the street, and getting absolutely blasted by a passing truck. Dead as a doornail but he still called later to say he enjoyed the concert.",

As there will ALWAYS be a least 1 respawning patrol in each area. So what I've been doing is switching to that archangel, selecting the vehicle I need to destroy to drive, then calling the archangel over and blowing up the other car/looking for respawning ones; and repeat. There are also some challenges that require moving vehicles, which in that case you just have to start a race and ignore the actual race component. I would highly suggest getting the challenge to do with big melee fights soon as well. I have a challenge to defeat 15 enemies in quick succession without taking damage, however I have no idea where to find 15 enemies ",

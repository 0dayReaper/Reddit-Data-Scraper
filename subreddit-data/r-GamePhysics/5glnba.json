All the typical Hardcore Nintendo franchises took a back seat to the motion controls.  \n\nWii U, though is not for casuals and much better exemplifies Nintendo hardcore fan base.",

A few new Mario games, some remakes, and an fps with spray-paint guns. \n\nAnd wtf are they doing to mario party? Been on a steady decline in quality since 3, increasing the ratio of games based on luck instead of skill, and almost all of them suck. If I want a party game with only 2 or 3 mini games worth playing, I'll stick with fusion frenzy.",

You can find people who buy madden every year know matter how similar each iteration is. In my experience, Nintendo fans are more critical of Nintendo than most and less willing to blindly accept a game just because it has a name slapped on it. Look at Metroid. The last two games were years between releases and they were ripped apart by the fandom. ",

                    "comment": "Yeah I am playing Deus ex mankind divided (so far my favourite cyberpunk game) and realised how much more context specific actions compared to the first Deus ex. In modern games you stick to walls and vault over objects which changes the view and movement of the character. When there's gap that kinda looks like you could fit if you crouch it sometimes is block off by an boundary box so the character won't get stuck. In old games your character had their basic movement, crouch and jump and didn't do context specific movement.",

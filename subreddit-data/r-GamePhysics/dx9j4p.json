Like I said, I\u2019ve played less than 2 hours online and haven\u2019t gone back because you can\u2019t even look around even a little bit to get a lay of the map so you can get better without getting killed immediately by a camper.",

Like I play this multiplayer game on Android called golf blitz, and it has major RNG in the accuracy of where your ball goes.  But the chaos of it all leads to some real laugh out loud situations - sure not all of them are \"I won because I'm the best\", but \"that shit was fucking hilarious\" can be entertaining too.  Obviously nobody wants to play a simple dice game but a good mixture can be really fun, and the more skilled players will still win more often than not.",

I remember thinking the maps were horribly boring after a while and then started looking at their layouts in the pause screen. Allllll of them have that 3-lane MOBA layout and then I realized why I didn't really enjoy any of them. It was almost *too* blatantly a 3-lane layout. Maybe it's because I'm older and more cynical now and I was younger then, but I swear I feel like the COD4, W@W, MW2, and BO1 maps had a little more versatility to them. They didn't all feel so squarely 3-lane.",

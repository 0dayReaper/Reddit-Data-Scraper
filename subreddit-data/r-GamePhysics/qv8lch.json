The best thing next to cached torrents is that it has pass codes and accounts to all the popular file sharing sites ppl upload obscure shit to, like dreamcast cdr releases. So you just feed it premium links and it has those instantly available for download also\n\nI've used seed boxes and real debrid. I'll don't see a reason to ever need a VPN\n\nThe cached torrents thing is goat though. I use it with a pirated copy of IDM, so basically I add a torrent magnet link and if it's a popular torrent I can immediately download it at my isps max download speed. Much faster than me torrenting  with qbittorent by itself",

Apparently the 3D model distorts a little when you turn your car, so it feels better, and more like the whole car is turning. The bug here is that this distortion should reset once you stop turning, but is not.\n\nApparently is a bug that appeared on the original version too.",

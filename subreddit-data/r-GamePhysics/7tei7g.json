The only reason is hasn't already been dumped is because there's nothing to replace it. \n\n  Yet.\n\n  Edit: yes, I know what Fortnite is, why does no one ever read shit before commenting? Literally 50 replies about Fortnite. \n\n  Fortnite is not a replacement for PUBG. Random bullet spread and no bullet drop (except for snipers, I know) makes it completely different. \n\n  IMO Fortnite is way too easy and plagued with dumb little kids. It's not even that fun or hard. The building spamming is really stupid too imo.",

I know it's a circle jerk, but the game isn't as much of a nightmare as people make it out to be. The devs have actually addressed most bugs within a reasonable time. The game poorly runs on shitty PCs, so then upgrade? People don't complain about Crysis not being able to run on a 780 but somehow it's not common sense a resource heavy game like PUBG doesn't need a good PC? I get over 100 fps with a 1070 and have had so much fun playing this game. ",

People are throwing machines into scrap with valid windows 7 stickers on them (even though you aren't supposed to use them on other computers). Go feed one of those old licenses into windows 10.\n\nI've seen people pirate windows 7, use an illegal activation tool, upgrade to 10 and never have a licensing problem again since their computer gets given its own unique valid activation.",

The gameplay is somewhat original, the gunplay is decent (bullet trajectories, damage etc.), and there is good potential for team-play. The \"last-man-standing\" aspect is also very adrenaline-filling, and you get a real desire to stay \"alive\". Few games can make you feel that instinctual \"fight-or-flight\" sensation as raw as this game does.\n\nHowever, it is also literally the most broken, glitchy, unoptimised piece of garbage software I have ever had the misfortune of encountering. I refuse to play it simply because I *can't* play it - albeit smoothly. Lag, stuttering, broken physics etc. - it just doesn't run properly. Both on my dual core crap machine (that can run AAA's at 60fps, PUBG caps at 23 fps..) and also on my 144hz beast..\n\nIt has about a thousand issues that you just don't see a lot of in modern games, because they actually spent time in development.  This didn't, as it was in early-access, so the development is still on-going (despite it being *\"officially released\"*).\n\nIt's definitely a good and fun video game, but if you enjoy things like graphics and performance, then play something else. Fortnite, I hear, doesn't suffer from half of these issues and is the only real competitor. \n",

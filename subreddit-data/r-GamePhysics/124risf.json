            "comment": "I played through this with 2 buddies and we found it was fairly lack luster.\n\n The skill tree was pretty bare bones with next to no interesting skills.\n\n The resource grind was absolutely horrible. Hell, to smith a single ingot you would have to wait 8 minutes. They did update the resource grind to be much easier and more reasonable now though. \n\nThe bosses were kinda cool, the concept of going and killing mini bosses to then open a portal is also kinda interesting. \n\nUnfortunately a lot of the enemies can be easily cheesed or lack difficulty at all. \n\nThe game has a long way to go before it is worth picking up again. \n\n\nFor those who say it's a Fortnite clone. Visually that's understandable but who actually cares. The entire premise of the game is a survival RPG. You fly between floating islands, kill enemies and bosses, open chests, do quests, level up, and upgrade your skill tree. \n\nI do like these visuals personally, as the game has a nice vibrant aesthetic.",

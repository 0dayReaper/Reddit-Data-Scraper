I initially thought \"surely it can't be that bad?\" \n\nThen I watched my friend playing on discord because I heard it had BF1942 and Bad Company modes... It was literally SO scuffed. \n\nIn maybe 40 minutes of watching, I saw ragdolls sliding around the floor, burned out planes sliding into mountains, invisible backfaces of easily accessible terrain, consistent glitch where you can't reload, consistent glitch where you can't switch weapon, consistent glitch where the crosshair of a tank is off centre by a significant margin, LODs with different Y-coordinates so buildings jerk around at a certain distance, enemies who don't take damage, tanks driving over people who don't take damage, doors being left standing when entire walls have been blown apart, that's just from the top of my head, the list goes on. \n\nThat's not even to mention the fucking godawful design decisions or oversights. Such as being able to easily out-heal tank damage. An engineer can sit on a tank and heal it with his wrench while 2 enemy tanks repeatedly hit it with shells. Nonsense. \n\nIts honestly one of the worst releases for a game I've ever seen.",

Of course I don't have claims on statistics either way. \n\n&gt; All games on that scale launch with bugs. It\u2019s pretty hard for them not to\n\nThey don't, but it's certainly more common now than before, simply because players will buy the games regardless of bugs and then make excuses for the company. You don't need to accuse gaming journalists and 'psyop' agents for tarnishing BF2042 when the game provides all the ammunition for the players themselves and players enable this cycle to repeat because they don't have the willpower to not buy on launch. \n\nOr would you agree with the guy I replied to and say Cyberpunk 2077 also was the victim of some nefarious agenda? I doubt that!",

Of course I don't have claims on statistics \n\nIt cuts both ways though, the game could be buggy for 1% of players and of 1% of them post a good to Reddit, that is still a lot of GIFs of bugs, along with the fact you can post a GIF to show a bug but you can't post a GIF to show a bug not happening. So you end up with a lot of confirmation bias, people complaining about bugs which won't effect everyone, who are able to back up their claims with proof, whereas people who aren't encountering bugs can't really prove evidence of their experience\n\nHaving said that, I wouldn't say 2042 is bug free, most that I've encountered have been pretty minor but I have had a few that have forced me to quit out of a game but in my personal opinion the bugs have been not blown out of proportion. As you say though, I can only speak of my personal experience",

Make it look fun, make it look boring, make it look buggy.

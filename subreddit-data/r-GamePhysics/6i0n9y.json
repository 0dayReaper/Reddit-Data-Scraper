It doesn't care if there are any incorrect letters, it's only looking for correct letters.\n\nIf they did it on purpose the most likely reason is so the player can type something like \"an apple\" or \"app le\" and still get the correct answer.

The one I have right now is sort of similar (it pairs up the first, second, third, etc.       Letters in the right answer and guessed answers and checks if enough of them match), and it suffers from some serious bugs. Getting an answer checker that accepts the answers people expect it to is tough stuff.",

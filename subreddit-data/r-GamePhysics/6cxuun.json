Some say that life is defined by being able to grow and rebuild by ones own power, but one could argue that crystals fall in that category. Some say that something is alive if it has cells, but what of the cells themselves? Are they alive, and what makes them alive? Life is strange and magnificent, but so mysterious in its nature. So what is your life? We may never know for sure.",

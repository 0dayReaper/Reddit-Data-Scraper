    "postText": "Hello there, I'd like to introduce you to what I've been working on solo for the past 8 years and 3 months.\n\nIt has been tough, but I finally did it. The game combines platforming with physics, which has been quite a challenge to achieve. I had to hack the physics multiple times to get the platforming right, and it gave me a lot of headaches.\n\nI'd like to highlight the liquid simulation that can flow on destructible terrain perfectly, you can even swim on it, also when aliens die, they explode in jelly that will slow you down as well for example.  \nI hope you like it.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/12v13ny/video/5zdk7odgreva1/player\n\nSTEAM: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1234180/Moons\\_Of\\_Darsalon/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1234180/Moons_Of_Darsalon/)  \nFeaturing:\n\n* Advanced platformer AI including dynamic terrain detection, jump force calculation, light sensitivity, inter-NPC communication.\n* Voice Commands to control companion NPCs.\n* Dynamic ground destruction and creation.\n* Full Interactive and realistic Liquid physics.\n* Realistic off-road vehicle physics.\n* Twitch integration for the viewers to send comic bubble phrases.\n* 8-bit music based on the MOS 6581 (SID) chip from 1982.\n* 8-bit speech synthesis.\n* Unique render pipeline that combines modern lighting, 2D sprites, and 3D models pixelated in real-time consistently and with a restricted color palette for an authentic retro feel.\n* 30 Challenging levels.\n* Adaptive difficulty + Fixed Difficulty.\n* Optional Challenges.\n* 4 endings.\n* CRT filter.",

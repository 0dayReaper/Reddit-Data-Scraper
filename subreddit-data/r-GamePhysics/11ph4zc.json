That satisfaction of finally winning.\n\nHonestly, I can't recommend DS1 as a first Soulsborne. Elden Ring is just so much better, as the culmination of everything they've learnt over the DS trilogy, that it's absolutely what I would recommend over it",

Doesn't make the game bad. \n\nI'm just saying that there gets a point where you stop caring about dying, take each death and learn from it, and end up some massive satisfaction for getting through. It's not unique to Soulsborne games either. Many roguelikes work of the similar compulsion. Hades was one of the games that really helped me get past the frustration feeling. \n\nAlso not one of those Soulsborne players who thinks they're the ONLY good games. My GOTYs in recent years have varied from Elden Ring to Hades to Psychonauts 2 to Outer Wilds (which I assume you're a fan of).\n\nThere's just a particular itch that Soulsborne games scratch, and jank aside (which is a major issue with Dark Souls 1) the Soulsborne games have some of the most satisfying 3D combat I've ever played.",

You gotta walk forever, DS3 is a bit more forgiving, like the Nameless King being literally right next to the bonfire and the Dancer is a straight run, but for DS1 you gotta run through two whole ass areas filled with human enemies, go down stairs and across a bridge, just to get stepped on by a big wolf.

So one kingdom is all sentient hats, one kingdom is talking kitchen utensils, one kingdom is all snails who live on the beach of a seltzer water sea, stuff like that. Bowser has been traveling across the world causing chaos and it\u2019s up to Mario to fix everything.\n\nNew Donk City is a location in the Metro Kingdom, which is a seemingly infinite megacity inhabited by normal humans, but they aren\u2019t really the same kind of beings as Mushroom Kingdom humans like Mario and Luigi and Peach.\n\nBut as for any other questions you might have, the answer probably boils down to \u201cbecause why not\u201d.",

The big letters are supposed to be restricted to this small space, however there is a glitch to where you can take it out of bounds. The letters were never meant to be taken out of their small area, so the programmers didn't need to make collision or anything with the letters, which is why the taxi just phases through. And upon leaving the taxi with the letter, for whatever reason, it sends you flying at insane speeds. I just did that in a very specific way and spot to get myself to the platform.",

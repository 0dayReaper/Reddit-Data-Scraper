Because getting left in the dust in last place and pulling away from the pack in first are both extremely boring scenarios that may as well be single-player.\n\nSo if you pull away from the pack you'll get power items thrown at you while you get none yourself and it becomes really hard to stay away from the pack.  And if you're in last you're more likely to get a huge boost to pull you up toward the other racers.\n\nIs it perfect?  No.  But it certainly accomplishes what they set out to do to some degree.",

There are so many racing games but only one Mario Kart, it fills a niche. It's a party game, Mario Party in racing form. \n\nAll that said, you're totally overreacting. \"Skill doesn't matter\" is such hyperbole. If you play Mario Kart 8 online for any period of time you'd see that technique, map knowledge and proper use of items is huge, and you won't hit the top 3 without some good skill.",

It's learning all the shortcuts, perfect driving and how to win despite shit happening to you. Will you get fucked? Absolutely, all the time. But you have to recover (at least more often than you don't). That 9998 was playing about 4 hours daily for 6 months, at that level you get +1 or 2 points for a win and -200 for a loss, it's brutal. So much cussing at the TV lol, good times.",

I've been playing on Switch and it's a ton of fun, but there are still some moments where just a turn of bad luck can happen in terms of getting destroyed in the game. I've never personally seen anything like this clip happen in the game when I've played, so as far as I can tell the clip that this thread is about is just a bug. For the video I linked, it's pretty rare that something happens to this extent, I've never seen it this bad outside of this video.",

It's harder than it sounds because the game would boot you if you weren't always making some progress.  Anyway, I was actually pretty damned good at the game and I would wait until someone with a bunch of stars over their head would show up in a race and then just destroy them.  Losing to someone with that much of a lower rank would suck thousands of points from their stats.\n\nIt was dickish, but comical.",

If I'm in 7-12th place, what use is a blue shell really going to do me? It only hits #1 (or sometimes #2, at seemingly random), and it really doesn't help me all that much. Sure, sometimes someone else gets hit as it rushes to the front, but it's not often because the blue shell follows down the middle of the course and there's usually ample warning to get away from the middle of the course. I rarely get hit by a blue shell unless I'm the target.\n\nSo really, the only thing the blue shell does is hurt 1st place while giving me, the person who needs help, nothing. I'd much rather a golden mushroom, a bullet bill, a piranha plant, almost anything else besides the useless items like coins and banana peels.  ",

Meanwhile the guy in first place gets completely shafted by someone who gained no tangible benefit from its use. 95% of the time the blue shell helps #2 get into #1, but doesn't help me, which means that even with this criteria for its appearance it doesn't change anything.\n\nHonestly the only time I see the blue shell being a good item is when the #1 person has a MASSIVE lead on everyone else. #2 getting a blue shell in that scenario will directly help them reduce the lead and directly benefit them.",

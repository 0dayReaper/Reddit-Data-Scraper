So all of a sudden all these guys show up, and doesn't matter how insanely well you're hidden, they always find you .. \nEven then, when you start fighting them and are very obviously winning, all of a sudden you get sniped by some kind of dart of something? \nIt's just bullshit, just give me the fucking cutscene, man. It only feels less realistic and annoying if you add something like this in it. Don't act like I'm still playing but you know I'm not ..",

Then you always run out of ammo too, even with upgrades it's not near enough. Can't have realistic ammo capacity coupled with completely unrealistic aggressiveness, just doesn't make sense. Also the stealth system could be better. I love stealth games and I haven't seen a really good one since splinter cell chaos theory",

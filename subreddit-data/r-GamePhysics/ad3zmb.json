Clearly, it is this second part, the missing, that presents the difficulties.\"*\n\n...You must learn how to throw yourself at the ground and miss. Pick a nice day and try it. The first part is easy. All it requires is the ability to throw yourself forward with all your weight and the willingness not to mind that it's going to hurt. That is, it's going to hurt if you fail to miss the ground. If you are really trying properly, the likelyhood is that you will fail to miss the ground fairly hard.\n\nClearly, it is the second part, the missing, which presents the difficulties.\n\nOne problem is that you have to miss the ground accidentally. It's no good deliberately intending to miss the ground because you won't. You have to have your attention suddenly distracted by something else then you're halfway there, so that you are no longer thinking about falling, or about the ground, or about how much it's going to hurt if you fail to miss it.\n\nIt is notoriously difficult to prise your attention away from these three things during the split second you have at your disposal. Hence most people's failure, and their eventual disillusionment with this exhilarating and spectacular sport.\n\nIf, however, you are lucky enough to have your attention momentarily distracted at the crucial moment by, say, a gorgeous pair of legs (tentacles, pseudopodia, according to phyllum and/or personal inclination), or a bomb going off in your vicinity, or by suddenly spotting an extremely rare species of beetle crawling along a nearby twig, then in your astonishment you will miss the ground completely and remain bobbing just a few inches above the ground in what might seem to be a slightly foolish manner...",

I'm more afraid of Alpha Volatiles because they basically 1-hit you in the hardest game mode and they will definitely out-run you on flat ground. They also take 2-3 crossbow shots to the head to kill while they tend to move very fast, which makes it hard to aim.  \n\nAnd if they can't reach you, they spit at you, which kills you pretty quickly too.  \nDid I mention they travel in packs usually?",

If you tweaked this bit, and this, and this enemy had this much less health, and this area had a save point just here, and this mission had this and this and you could skip this bit and this and that. Lots of niggly little things that add up. The sequel though sounds like they're taking much more ambitious steps and hopefully fixing all those issues. Its also written by Chris Avellone (of Kotor 2, Fallout New Vegas and Planescape Torment) so the writing will definitely be improved.",

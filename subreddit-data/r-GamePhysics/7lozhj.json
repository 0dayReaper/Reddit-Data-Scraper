Asking 20 bucks when it's your first game (and it shows), when you have some of the best indie games of all time at a similar price, is really bold. I think you need to go with a lower price when you start out to get a fanbase, but I hope it works out for them, they seem to be polishing it which is cool.",

The developers bit off more than they could chew. \n\nThe core character design and player mechanics are fun, but there is zero variety in the levels, and the enemy AI is literally just \"run towards the player\". Like, not even with an aggro system, it's just, whenever an enemy spawns anywhere on the map, they immediately start running towards the player, regardless of distance or vision. The result is a game that looks awesome, and feels awesome, but after about an hour you've basically seen it all. \n",

I guess for most other games, asking one of the devs wouldn't really get me a good/fair reply, but you guys seem pretty cool and I think you know the most about what exactly this game has to offer, what it lacks, and what will be coming in future updates.\n\nThe idea is really cool, but I'm a bit worried if it's actually fun for more than a few hours. Do you think the game offers good replayability? And what stuff might be added/changed in the future that might convince people like me to buy it?",

We currently have a 66% review score (which is mixed, which games that are below 50% review score also get on Steam, but that's a rant for another day :-) )\n\nBut somewhere around that 7/10 range is pretty fair for our game.  If blowing shit up as a mage sounds like fun, then you should at least get a few hours out of it (a \"run\" takes 2-4 hours, depending on playstyle).\n\nSo of course I would recommend it, we made the game because we didn't feel like there was a good game out there that made you feel like a truly badass mage.\n\nI'm kind of rambly, in this response, but yea, I think our game is worth it, and you should get quite a few hours out of it if you enjoy the gameplay.  1.1 should improve the AI a bit and make the game a little more dynamic to play, and 1.1 should hopefully be out w/in a month or two, but sometimes bugs have a way of sidelining our goals.",

I haven't fully read the review yet, but I'm happy to hear there are plans for mod support and especially MacOS/Linux versions of the game. I use Linux as my main OS, and most of the games I play work on Linux as well. I dualbooted my PC with Windows for the few games that don't support it (Payday 2 and the Witcher 3), but prefer not using it if I don't need to, so a Linux version would be really awesome. I just watched the Steam trailer/preview video and it looks very cool, I think I'll just buy it.\n\nAgain, thanks a lot for the honest reply. It's much appeciated. :)\n\nEDIT: Just bought it. I'll be installing it later today or tomorrow, as I need my PC now and can't switch to my Windows partition (and even with a Linux version, I'd probably have to wait because my internet is pretty slow). Really exited to try it out! :D",

You're playing this mage guy who survives his own execution and is basically set against the world. The game is structured in a rouguelike permadeath sort of way, hence the FTL comparison, with some elements that carry over between runs like unlocking starting spells. The map and levels system is literally exactly like FTL but in case you're unfamiliar with that game, it's split into several sectors, each of which has many nodes which you can visit which might contain combat encounters (where the meat of the gameplay is as seen in this video) where you have to kill the enemies and reach the end to progress, or you might find quests which launch missions which will reward you for completing the combat encounter with special requirements, or you might, rarely, find nothing. There's also a shop a couple of times a level where you can buy and sell stuff like gear and spells, which can also be randomly found in the levels. Collecting and upgrading spells is a pretty major part of it, and you can add modifiers which change how the spell works. These modifiers activate when you cast in a specific way and choose how to \"shape\" your spell. For example a fireball spell might have modifiers for high velocity, damage, and explosion size.",

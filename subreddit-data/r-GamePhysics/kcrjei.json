He awoke, his vision filled with the grimey porcelain walls of his bathtub.  He was having trouble getting up.  His grogginess clearing quickly upon the discovery that he could not move.  His arms and legs no more.  He felt disconnected.  \n\nHe recently got his new attachments but needed to take it easy and chill there in his wheelchair.  His friend is at the hotdog stand nearby.",

I think it comes back to hype. Nobody expected anything from Valhalla so they were fine with the bugs, but everybody expected the world from Cyberpunk so they're so much more up in arms.\n\nJust to clarify - I'm not defending Cyberpunk entirely. It has a lot of bugs, and needed multiple more months of development. It is disappointing, but my issue is with the fan reaction. It's been way overcriticised imo, and people need to look at it as the product that it is, not the product they had staked their dreams on",

I've also seen a lot of people claiming CDPR promised a lot of features that they didn't give... but they can't never clearly say what those features are or when they were promised. I knew this was gonna happen the moment I read so many people way before release date talking about this game like it was gonna be the ultimate life simulation game, instead of an RPG. I expected a fun game and that's exactly what I got. The PS4 release is still pretty inexcusable though, if what I've heard about it is true.",

There's no feasible way to replicate that amount of bug testing before launch, unless people wanted to wait additional years. But then people would've whined about the delays. \n\nI've defo lost some respect over last gen state of the game, though it runs fine for me (2070 super, and 3950x)",

In a utopian world, a piece of software could stay in development until it's perfect, but reality isn't that. I could have told you 6 months ago that this game was going to run like absolute dog shit on the hilariously-outdated hardware that is last-gen consoles. CDPR's biggest mistake was acting like it would be fine.\n\nI've played games for decades and I don't recall the last major release that was silky smooth and polished to perfection starting on day 1. It just never happens like that. Software is complex and dynamic. \n\nSo far, I've had a couple squirrely physics/rag-doll effects and 1 instance where I had to scrub back a few autosaves because a side quest was bugged in an unplayable way.

Red Dead Redemption. And how long did it take to make each of those? Try to not spend that time? You end up with a very meager game, like happened in No Man's Sky.\n\nNo, it is a perfectly valid, understandable choice. Especially given this bug.\n",

As crazy as that sounds and stupid as that sounds, I don't think it can be clarified as the same.\n\nE.g. I made a completely empty map on Arma, or ... Halo or something. It was empty but you could drive around in it and see buildings. Would you call that free roam? Or at least be able to compare it to the calibre of other 'free roam' games from the same timeframe?\n\nI... Dunno.\n\nI guess it depends on if you'd call a Forza horizon game where you could shoot and steal cars...freeroam. With only activities being story missions and/or changing your suit.\n\nI guess rockstar really pinned into my soul the point of having side activities... A breathing and living freeroam experience(that now many games achieve)\n\nAnd even quirks like funny messages printed on a wall somewhere or something. Shit, it's such a linear game!\n\nI'd call a truck simulator freeroam and a farming simulator freeroam too, why? Because it wasn't just nothingness.",

You might end up with two left wheels. Are you saying you would also expect it to analyze your creation and prioritize based on its inferred understanding of your intent? If you have a setup with 3 gliders side by side and a control stick in the middle with a fan on either of the two side wings, but you only have 2 gliders on hand(+all others stuff), what should it do? Glider next to glider with a single fan on the left one with the control stick on the right? You'd probably have a hard time flying with an off center center-of-thrust",

For vehicles, it's easier to build them lying in the side of the wheel, but still you'll have times when they tip over or you have parts that can't stand in their side like a sled. Or there's just no flat plane so you can't quite align parts correctly. \n\nIn this amazingly impressive game, one of the biggest oversights is that we can't freeze builds when using ultra hand. Also that we can't just pull zonai devices out already attached to ultrahand.",

The engine works with multiple layers of ai, so characters will value self preservation (reaching out for objects, covering their head), or trying to reset their pose (by staggering to regain balance, say), and one of the best places to view the engine is the force unleashed games - force powers can be used to test behaviours. Storm troopers, when picked up, or falling, will try and grab objects, or even other troopers desperately to save themselves.",

These calculated animations are called inverse kinematics, or IK for short. IKs may also be used for regular animations (and probably are), but without ragdoll mode.",

What I think is happening here is that the engine is trying to self-correct the animation so that it looks like the character stumbled a bit and then started walking again, but it doesn't quite manage to so the character just falls over anyway",

There's no way to tell the difference between a normal item and a hacked item until you pick it up, and if you don't know how the game works there's no way to tell the difference until you get banned later and ask why you're banned.",

They were never punished, but the people they attacked were. The anti-cheat basically only bans people if one of like three things happens, so the hackers just don't do any of those three things and instead force it onto others.\n\nWhile I'm not 100% on whether picking up items can still ban you (Pretty sure it can, and they can also drop items when you don't see them so a new player might just think they found an item) I do know that there's still tons of hackers in the game who will do things like spam stunlock you for 0 damage while making your screen flash every single colour rapidly and constantly spam the loudest sound effects in the game dozens of times a second, leaving you unable to do anything but close the game.",

Absolutely the best way is to buy berserk cyberware which when activated makes you not drain stamina, which when you spam attacks and jumping makes you level very very quickly. Also if you haven\u2019t yet fought Animals brawler champion it\u2019s a good way to combine it since you can fight her repeatedly without bets. Take fight, activate berserk, spam and continue fighting until she kills you or give up near the end. I leveled this way in about half an hour athletics to 13, which is when you get all the non-melee beneficial bonuses.",

The only way to do it with any speed is to cheese it. Not even mentioning that taking perks to reduce stamina usage slows it even further.",

It's the only one I've \"gamed the system\" for so far because of its lack of natural progression speed. I expect CDPR will probably tweak it in the future, but for now, it's woefully lagging.\n\nAlso, considering I just bind the jump button to a macro on my pc, it actually is pretty fun since I literally do nothing to progress the skill manually. But hey, to each their own. You're welcome to try to progress your athletic skill in the game as it's currently designed. I just choose to actually have fun my way (by actually getting the friggn skill to progress anywhere at all).",

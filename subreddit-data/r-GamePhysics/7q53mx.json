Those are usually axis-aligned which offers speed over precision as a first pass collision check. In this case, the bird actually has no \"physics\" operations on it and probably is just on rails.",

For example, if it's another entity like a player or another NPC, it will simply stop them, while if it collides with a weapon it will take damage instead.\n\nIt's very unlikely that the collider that handles non-combat collisions would be different than the collider that handles combat collisions, it just doesn't make sense from a resource perspective. Which means that the bird's collider is ridiculously huge most likely to allow the players to actually hit it when it's in the air and a sizable distance away.",

It lived in water because it was too heavy to walk.\n\nEdit: corrected numbers. the proportion is size^3, not size^2. Imagine a cubic ant. Every time you increase its height, its area increases by the square and its volume (or weight) by the cube.",

They are members of the extinct order Eurypterida (Chelicerata); which is the most diverse Paleozoic chelicerate order in terms of species. The name Eurypterida comes from the Greek words eury- (meaning \"broad\" or \"wide\") and pteron (meaning \"wing\"). This name was chosen due to the pair of wide swimming appendages on the first fossil eurypterids discovered.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/GamePhysics/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

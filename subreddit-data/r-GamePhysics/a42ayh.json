                    "comment": "Well, currently, there are two wrestling games out right now, both are vastly different depending on what you're looking for.\n\n*Fire Pro World* is more of a wrestling simulation where the bread and butter of the game and its series is within the AI's logic of the characters you can create and you can faithfully recreate how a wrestler works a match. For example, if you make Hulk Hogan, you can make his CPU logic do the big boot/scoop slam, taunt, leg drop, pin, all in one go.\n\nIf you're not keen on playing (which has a pretty steep learning curve, primarily based on timing), simulating matches are still fun to watch. The graphics in FPW are sprite based, essentially looking like a throwback to 16 bit games, yet there is still a deep creation suite, choosing hair pieces, masks, pants, bear parts, tons of moves to choose from, create your own ring, title, etc. Also, there is a huge creation community so you can download virtually anybody you can think of. Currently, there is one story mode with two more storylines later and a promoter mode as DLC.\n\n*WWE 2K19* is graphical powerhouse. The lighting has vastly improved, models are super detailed, a vast variety of moves to choose from, create your own entrance, arena, title, TV show, etc. Import your own logos and face to apply to your own custom wrestlers. The on disc roster is huge, IIRC, over 150 wrestlers. It plays like a hybrid of arcade and simulation gameplay, with stamina meters and momentum meters as well. Ton of match types are available, from a 4-on-4 ladder match to the Royal Rumble to 2-on-2-on-2 Hell in a Cell. The commentary is still atrocious though. Also, there's two story modes: one following the WWE career of Daniel Bryan and one original story using your created wrestler. Also, there is Universe mode, where you set up your own shows, PPVs, storylines and you can play them out.\n\nPersonally, from a gameplay standpoint, I'm more of a Fire Pro fan when it comes to pure wrestling. But on an overall fun scale, 2K19 all the way.",

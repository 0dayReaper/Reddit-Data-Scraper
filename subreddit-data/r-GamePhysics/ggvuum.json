The female breasts have unique physics when it comes to animation and can't be addressed with mocap if you want them to work with the game environment directly as hot as it might be imagining an actress attaching motion sensing lightbulbs on her breasts.",

But anyway, here's my list of female characters which weren't objectified in games I've played. And these are the ones I've played, not including the plenty of games out there I haven't played. And I'm probably even missing a few which I *have* played.\n\n1.) Chell (Portal, Portal 2)\n\n2.) Sarah Palmer (all the female Spartans, actually)\n\n3.) Zoe (Left 4 Dead)\n\n4.) Rochelle (Left 4 Dead 2)\n\n5.) Zelda\n\n6.) Literally any female in Gears of War (unless Roady-Running is your thing; weird flex but okay)\n\n7.) Princess Peach\n\n8.) Miranda Keyes\n\n9.) The Dragonborn (I mean, you *could* but that's really player choice and usually only through mods and therefore not developer intention)\n\n10.) Princess Daisy\n\n11.) Rosalina (Super Mario Galaxy)\n\n12.) Clover (Payday 2)\n\n13.) Bonnie (Payday 2)\n\n14.) Mrs. Pac-Man\n\n15.) Isabel (Animal Crossing)\n\n16.) Dr. Vahlen (XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within)\n\n17.) Shen (XCOM 2)\n\n18.) Borderlands Characters\n\n19.) Virtually *all* Sims characters\n\n20.) Ellie (The Last of Us)",

Honestly I enjoy it more than skate 3.  The ability to control things like flip speed and catch, so many ways of make things look realistic and steezy as hell - it\u2019s amazing if you just wanna film that perfect backside flip over a gap or whatever.  If your idea of playing skate 3 was spending hours trying to recreate some line from a real life skate movie, it\u2019s the game for you for sure.  \n\nPeople in the second group will likely find Skater XL lacking, since it doesn\u2019t really provide any of the \u201cfun\u201d stuff they enjoyed about the skate series.",

I always wondered, is there a way to switch the camera in the later Skate games to be more like in the first game? I know that some people found the low angle frustrating but IMO it's *much* better since it gives you such a great view of how exactly you pull off the tricks.\n\nGameplay videos of later Skate games always paled in comparison, imo, looking way more acard-y like Tony Hawk games, whereas the first Skate had a feel of an actual real life skating montage.",

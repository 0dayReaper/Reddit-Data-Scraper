Not allowed in that whole warzone area of Pacifica?  Literally jump the gate and explore the floating hollow buildings. Same with the Stadium, the other megabuilding, the unfinished resort, etc.",

The best game I've ever played to be honest. I've tried playing other games since, and they all pale in comparison.\n\nToo bad Rockstar doesn't produce too many games. Maybe GTA 6 will implement some of the attention to detail that RDR2 did, but I doubt it. It's insane how great the technical achievement of the game is if you pay attention.",

Like you step on a bucket and it launches across the room or tumbles across the ground faster than a singularity.  Or you put a bucket on someone's head and they never see you.  But I've never fallen through the ground, launched into space, noticed gigantic clipping trees or whatever.  As far as glitches go, none of them have broken my threshold as being any worse than other games I've played.\n\nNow...I did play a fair amount of WWII Online from 2001 to 2008 and that game had some pretty massive glitches and wonky physics we just dealt with.  Like driving a truck over a small bump and having it launch 100 yards, spilling all of the infantry out along the way.  Or a tank just flipping over if you accidentally drove off the road.  Or missing tiles of land that you'd accidentally drive through and fall into nothingness.  ...or one time I spawned in and it looked like it was snowing everywhere...but there's no snow in that game.  On the whole it was still a pretty fun game, if not slow moving because the continuous game map is literally 1/2 the size of actual France/Belgium/Lux/Germany. ...and if you have no vehicles to drive you around you kind of just have to run a few miles to the battle.",

I saw the white Arabian getting attached by wolves within the first minute of being out there. I scared off the wolves but also apparently the horse because I spent the next 5 in game days looking for that white fucker under the impression that it was the best horse in the early game.\n\nThen I found it, I calmed it, I tamed it, and on the way back via auto run I heard a stranger mission, I jump out of auto run to look for them, and I guess the horse couldn't read the geometry because what followed was us falling off a 50ft cliff to the horses death.",

Imagine you're proned, going down the stairs. Even with the best animation, sometimes knees will go through the stairs. So fix that, when the knee would clip through the stairs, it is instead flattened at that location. When this function bugs out, you end up with these funny scenarios. \n\nBut yeah, this is Ubisoft, fixes one bug, opens up a 100 more.",

Yeah their games have bugs, but most modern games do. However, when you find a bug in e.g. Witcher 3 or Skyrim it's usually laughed about (not to say they aren't funny, as I laugh about them too), but when a bug happens in for example Assassin's Creed, people go \"UBISOFT IS SO SHIT THEY CAN'T EVEN RELEASE A BUG-FREE GAME!!!\"\n\nWhat's up with that?",

Its not so much about thier games, the buggyness is understandable by them always pushing new tech in the industry. The main problem with Ubisoft is the corporate side, that would go and spout bullshit, lie and otherwise do everything to spite its own customers. And lets also remmeber they were the first company to release a singleplayer game that requires always-only DRM (Assassin's Creed 2) and people remmeber the first one the worst.\n\nThe whole bug thing comes mostly from Unity realease, that, at release, could be legitimatelly considered the worst PC port in history.\n\nWitcher 3 buggyness isnt anywhere close to what Ubisoft does. The game is bug free in comparison. And in Skyrim and other Bethesda \"lets let the fans do all the work\" games, they at least give you multitude of ways to fix the bug yourself without breaking your game. something Ubisoft does not.\n\n**TL;DR: Reddit hates Ubisoft too much, but there are underlying reasons for it.**",

In any case, I put ghosts in the same category as leaderboards. They're a multiplayer feature, but I don't know if I'd call it a multiplayer mode.\n\nThe thing about multiplayer is that there is some sort of interaction between players. This is true even of asynchronous multiplayer. In a turn-based game you're still acting on the same board and changing the game for other players. In games like 8-bit and 16-bit Mario you're sitting on the couch ribbing your friends about how badly they suck, and that exchange changes the game both as the non-player and player. This doesn't really exist in a game with ghosts, leaderboards, or something like A Link Between Worlds' shadow links.\n\nWith the shadow links, I might as well be fighting any other mob in the game. The fact that I'm fighting against \"another player's\" character doesn't change anything because it doesn't act like a real player would. Similarly, with racing ghosts I might as well be racing against a stopwatch.",

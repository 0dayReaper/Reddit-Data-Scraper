When you fast travel to a place, and the ripple animation from where you spawn \"loads\" the world, it looks cool and is a reminder that you're in a simulator. However, it also covers up the textures loading in for your game. It takes an unavoidable immersion hurting part of any video game, and turns it into a subtle plot device.",

A lot of the good Elite ship upgrades are in diving locations so you can't get to them until you've reached that point in the story. It's not too far in either, maybe 1/3rd of the game. I did that and then spent wayyyy too long just being a pirate and upgrading to take down the legendary ships.",

Most of my time I spent wandering the map, collecting the treasures, beating the legendary ships, building Kenway's fleet, etc.\n\nI unlocked everything, did every last side mission. And then for like 4 hours I just used fast travel and bounced from place to place doing the main story that I hadn't touched in months lol. \n\nMost fun I've had with an AC game since getting ACII on release day.",

Black Flag may be better as a game, but it's not an AC game and, to be fair, everything fun about it is in free roam in the sea and everything else is shit. Syndicate had a new and interesting way to free roam that works better with big city of London. grapple hook is really unrealistic, but you just gotta blame it on it being a game. plot is interesting in the way main heroes interact. also it felt more like an AC1 in killing bad guys, they had a lot more presence and weight to them (I guess, because you need to take their districts first). feeling of creating your own gang is really there, every though there's not enough gang action when you free roam. the only real problem with Syndicate I have is that Ubisoft didn't advertise it and people didn't play it because of it. I find colorless (everything being yellowish is colorless), slow, gamey, lore-changing and unoriginal in both plot and gameplay Origins a lot worse game. didn't play Odyssey tho.",

The thing I loved about Zelda games was completing puzzle filled dungeons to get items to progress. Not having to worry about my sword breaking after every 10 hits and doing 70+ small unenjoyable puzzle dungeons. Maybe I haven't given it enough time. Also I'm playing on an emulator with a ps3 controller.",

At some point you're Desmond wall-jumping up a modern skyscraper that's I think under construction?

Kinda lost the plot and felt like they were just dragging it out.\n\nBut I lived for exploring the god areas, getting lore holograms and similar. Even reading office emails and stickies and just nosing around the environment. And I think I remember loving the current world convos in AC1, just exploring your prison and listening to the docs.\n\nAC1 was the first action RPG I ever played and I begrudgingly picked it up expecting to hate it because I hate FPS and thought it would be more like Call of Duty (for some reason). Omg I loved the absolute shit out of AC1 and AC2, could not get enough. And I remember thinking the animus was a brilliant framing device for a video game.",

In Unity they barely even pretended to have one and I've hardly followed the Layla story since.\n\nThe modern day story worked great when it was used as the logical continuation of the ancestor's story, when you were playing as a modern day Assassin trying to figure out your place and go on your own adventure. AC1 through Revelations did an okay job setting that up, and AC3 *almost* stuck the landing in its later half. Just a shame they decided to only play lip service to it later on.",

But even though the classic methods of healing in FPS games made little sense either (food or some bandages and you're good as new!), people healing by themselves might have been a bit jarring or seem too easy by the standards of the times.\n\nIntroducing the perfect excuse to have people \"healing up\" automatically: The Powered Assault Armor, that has this energy shield that recharges.\n\nIt might sound like a far-fetched theory but remember that healing up automatically was far from the FPS standard back when the first Halo game was released. In a FPS that could feel like cheating. And not saying they have an armor *because* they wanted this gameplay feature. No doubt they already had some badass armor design in mind (it's a sci-fi shooter after all). Just saying that the way the suit works might have been a thing they thought of later.\n\nAnyway, it reminded me of that in the sense that the game provides a in-story explanation for a very game-like feature.",

Black Flag was an amazing game, but it was a pirate game, only somewhat grounded in the AC story to move the plot along. Having just finished Origins, I would also put that one in the top list, although it was the first one I've played in a long time.\n\nAlso a big part I think is the protagonist of all those games I just mentioned were actually likeable and engaging (looking at you Connor).\n\nEdit: grammar",

Essentially it does the animation but drops me at the top of the thing and I get fall dmg. My bro, who's a diehard AC fan, said he encountered this glitch around 31 times throughout all of his replays of the game. \n\nI also got stuck in something in AC2 and had to restart the damn game. \n\nBut I don't remember any other glitches.",

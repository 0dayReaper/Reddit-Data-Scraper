I know it's popular but I feel like it deserves Fallout/something far beyond level of recognition not only is the series it gets its story from great as it's own thing but I feel like there has never been a Metro release that wasn't beautiful utilizing every technology possible *while* being carefully optimized with a relatively (to some large AAAs who put out relative garbage) small team, it shocked me how short the credits were for such a beautiful game.\n\nIf there's a new tech you can bet a Metro game is not only gonna use it but use it well. Pretty sure it used global illumination in ray tracing really well too.",

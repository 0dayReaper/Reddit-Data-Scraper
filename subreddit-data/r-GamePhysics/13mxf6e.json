Main game is pretty fun, escalating difficulty, see how far you can go and do certain challenges/tricks/beat a timer type stuff. But there is also a ton of Freeplay type content with huge maps. Some are massive realistic mountain parks with trails, some are wacky skatepark style maps with mega ramps and such, and there are also Wipeout style obstacle course maps that are a blast. Also has steam workshop support for endless maps and endless replayability. \n\nAlso an excellent soundtrack. I expected more \"extreme sports\" style rock soundtrack, but it's actually a lot of drum and bass, chillstep, trance vibes. Sets the tone for the game to be more about just flowing with the hills and having fun.\n\nHighly recommend if you enjoy this style of game.",

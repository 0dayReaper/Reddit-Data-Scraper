I think it was more obvious how it applied to video games. \n\nThe idea is that most game physics engines use discrete time-steps ie. things don't move smoothly and fluidly, they step from one place to another to simulate movement. Part of how forces are calculated involves how far the object moved in a given amount of time. In the linked San Andreas vid we can see that the swingset is jittering, in other words it is moving distance in a single frame, almost no time at all, which can give rise to near-infinite force values. When the physics engine calculates how much force is needed to move a 20kg swingset 1 foot in 1/60th of a second from standstill, it's like HORY SHET *that's a lotta force* and the car happens to siphon some of this juice and go flying.

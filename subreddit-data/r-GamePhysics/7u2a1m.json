                            "comment": "Hey McQueen?\" Past this point King had no idea what he was doing... He knew he was happy to see him, and that ha was a good boy tonight.\n\n\"Yea-\" McQueen's response was cut short by King's mouth. He had moved forward slightly and forced their mouths together. It took exactly 3.6 seconds for McQueen to figure out what had happened and to act. He pushed back into King. He moaned slightly as he felt King's tongue on his lips. King had a slight dent on his lip, but he ignored the pain is caused when the younger car touched it.\n\nMcQueen's tongue meet King's but the older car's won. He allowed King to explore his mouth. Move over his teeth, around his tongue, and towards the back of his throat. McQueen began to rock back and forth on his wheels and King began to meet his movements. McQueen turned slightly to get a better angle of approach when he knocked over the glass. Without realizing he pulled back slightly and King released him. King's eyes went big when he realized what he had done. His hood went bright red and he turned away from McQueen. McQueen quickly grabbed a towel and dropped it on the spill, but quickly returned his attention to King. He was trying his best to not look or make eye contact with McQueen.\n\n\"King?\" King didn't reply or look towards McQueen. \"King?\" King sighed and looked at McQueen then quickly to the ground.\n\n\"I'm- I'm so sorry McQueen.\" King looked out the small window in the room. McQueen was royally confused. Did King have feelings for him? Was he shy or ashamed? He had to admit he enjoyed it but the arrangement would just not work. McQueen backed up, faced the door and left. King followed him with his eyes. He sighed and started to brood, until the door opened again a few minutes later. \"McQueen?\" McQueen had made a second appearance only this time with a foam mat.\n\n\"I'm sorry but these hard wood floors are very uncomfortable.\" King had an utterly confused look.\n\n\"Wait. You're not\u2026?\"\n\n\"Shh, too much talking.\" McQueen drove onto the mat and into King's mouth. Only this time it was his turn to invade King's mouth. He slowly sucked on his lower lip before following with his tongue, before entering his mouth. King groaned into the stock car's mouth before pulling away.\n\n\"McQueen, are- are you sure?\" He didn't want to pressure the kid but it didn't seem that the kid needed any.\n\n\"If I wasn't, I wouldn't have come back.\" McQueen kissed the older car one more time before moving away from his mouth to along side is his bumper. He kissed across his bumper and along his frame. When he got to his tires he lightly sucked on the metal above the tires and slipped his tongue underneath the arch. King groaned loudly as McQueen's touches sent shivers and the way to his tailgate. McQueen could taste oil and dirt as he explored King's chassis. He slowly moved down King's frame towards his back bumper. Making sure to be as gentle as possible to the badly damaged racecar. He bit, sucked, and licked his whole way down. Curling his tongue under his frame, finding his sensitive undercarriage and finding all the spots that made King moan. King managed to form a somewhat complete sentence.\n\n\"McQueen?\" He heard a response somewhere from his back tires. \"What if- oh god-\" King tried not to move a lot because of his injuries but if was very difficult. \"What if someone- uhh \u2013 what if someone comes in?\" McQueen chuckled.\n\n\"I took care of that.\" Spacing his words with kisses to the older car's spoiler. \"Told the nurse- no one was to come in till I left. And to call if someone wanted in.\" King was impressed. The boy thought of everything. When McQueen had caressed every part of King he could reach without pushing equipment out of the way or moving King he moved back towards Kings mouth. He slowly prodded the entrance but King wasn't letting him enter. McQueen instead licked under King's mouth. Pushing his tongue all the way up into King's engine. King relented as McQueen probed the sensitive motors and wires. As McQueen pulled his tongue out King quickly moved forward and shoved his tongue into the younger car's mouth. Being a lot more experienced then his bright red counterpart, King quickly got McQueen to moan loudly.\n\nKing performed similar to what McQueen had done, slowly moving down his frame. McQueen had to move forward because King couldn't move. It wasn't until King got to Lightning's back tire that he found McQueen's sweet spot. When he curled his tongue around the back of the arch above the tire McQueen started to shudder. He let out a loan moan and muttered inaudible words.\n\n\"Chrysler, - oh god, King, King - please more - don't stop.\" McQueen started to rock back and forth on his tires. King spent a little while on this spot. He moved his tongue around the various bumps and curves in his chassis, producing groans of approval from the car below him.\n\n\"Turn around \u2013 face the wall.\" McQueen did as he was told. King slipped his tongue under McQueen's back bumper and McQueen almost screamed. King slid his tongue in and out of McQueen's back end and McQueen meet his rhythm. Both cars moaning loudly.\n\n\"Oh god- King \u2013 King \u2013KING!\" Lightning shuddered violently and inadvertently backed into King.\n\n\"Oh shit!\" McQueen shook off his shudder and turned around.\n\n\"Oh my god! I'm so sorry, I didn't realize- I \u2013 I'm so sorry.\"\n\n\"It's okay. It's okay I promise, it just hurts a little.\" King winced slightly but seemed to be fine.\n\n\"Are you sure?\" King nodded. Lightning's worried look turned into a smug grin. \"Oh let me kiss it. Does it hurt here?\" King nodded and Lightning began kissing King's hood, periodically asking How about here? Lightning finally got down to King's mouth and gave him a long kiss and pulled out and looked him over. After a short pause Lightning inquired of King. \"So, what now?\"\n\n\"What do yah mean? You wanna do it again?\" King stared at Lightning with a curious look.\n\n\"No \u2013 I mean I'd love to, but that's not what I meant. I was wondering what comes next. I mean, do we date, do I move in with you?\" Lightning chuckled. \"What happens to, us?\" McQueen gave the older car a sheepish look.\n\n\"Well\u2026I'm\u2026not\u2026sure exactly. Cause I'm married and you've got your whole racing career ahead of you.\" King had a slightly worried look.\n\n\"So, we could be friends\u2026with benefits?\" McQueen gave King a sly look. \"I mean, we're both pretty good looking cars, we can't keep it all to ourselves, now can we?\" King let out a sigh. We was extremely glad that McQueen wasn't taking this hard. We really didn't want to think of the dire consequences that could have come out of this situation.\n\n\"I think I could do that. But you would have to visit me right?\" Lightning returned King's slightly lusty look. There was a knock on the door.\n\n\"Yes?\" both cars called in unison.\n\n\"Excuse me, but Dr. Shwab is here for you 1:30 check-up.\"\n\n\"1:30? Crap, I gotta go. I've got to meet with Harv for something this afternoon, and I completely lost track of time. I'll see you 'round.\" Lightning gave King a quick peck and turned to leave.\n\n\"Hold on a sec.\" King quickly grabbed some paper off the stand, there's the remote! Wrote a few lines, folded it, pulled a huge rose out of one of the bouquets and handed both to Lightning. \"Here, don't open till you're in your trailer.\" He returned the peck and called in the nurse.\n\n\"Oh, excuse me.\" Lightning held open the door for the nurse and the doctor and winked at King as he drove out. King sighed, chuckled to himself, and turned to face the doctor.\n\nMcQueen drove out of the hospital, smiling at the desk nurse and pulled into the parking lot. He looked around for Mack but couldn't see him.\n\n\"Sir! Please get out of the way!\" McQueen quickly dodged a huge car carrier carrying two badly damaged cars.\n\n\"Woah!\" McQueen pulled out of the rest of the way and drove towards the back of the parking lot. \"Oh, screw this.\" McQueen connected his car phone and called Mack.\n\n\"Yeah boss?\"\n\n\"Hey Mack can you come pick me up, I'm in front of the hospital.\"\n\n\"Hey, sure thing boss, be right there.\" McQueen waited near the front of the hospital, staying away from the car carrier entrance. A few seconds later Mack pulled out form behind the hospital and drove towards Lightning. \"So how was it?\"\n\n\"It was great- I mean, King was great- he was doing great.\" McQueen stumbled over the words trying to explain King's condition to Mack.\n\n\"Well, that's good to here. Hop on in.\" McQueen drove around behind Mack and into the trailer. When he got it, it took him a moment to remember the note King had left him. He set the flower down in a safe place and unfolded the letter. McQueen, I would love if you would attend my retirement party this Saturday. 253- 843-5464. King. P.S. that's my personal car phone. McQueen kissed the letter and stored it upon his car.\n\nMcQueen couldn't wait for Saturday.",

Then it started the whole thing. But we have had lots of this kind of weird bugs lately. Funny thing is, my friend said he didnt have the woods in there, he thought he had lost them at some point (he was driving the thing to that destination where we met). It just started to do that whenever I was near it later on, but didnt happen when my friend did it. Might have been because in his game, there was none there because in his screen (before I saw him) he either dropped them or they just disappeared (not even surprised if that happened, we have had LOTS of bugs lately)\n\nI have steam version and he has non-steam version, sometimes I wonder if thats the reason our games seems to differ occasionally. There are some odd lag spikes for example, when we are driving, it might look like in my screen that he crashes somewhere when actually he hasnt. Or vice versa",

Then it started the whole thing. But we have had lots of this kind of weird bugs lately. Funny thing is, my friend said he didnt have the woods in there, he thought he had lost them at some point (he was driving the thing to that destination where we met). It just started to do that whenever I was near it later on, but didnt happen when my friend did it. Might have been because in his game, there was none there because in his screen (before I saw him) he either dropped them or they just disappeared (not even surprised if that happened, we have had LOTS of bugs lately)\n\nI have steam version and he has non-steam version, sometimes I wonder if thats the reason our games seems to differ occasionally. There are some odd lag spikes for example, when we are driving, it might look like in my screen that he crashes somewhere when actually he hasnt. Or vice versa",

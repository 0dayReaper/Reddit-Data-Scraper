I remember reading that Spidey's costume was originally red and black, and the blue was to indicate shadows: https://www.spidermancrawlspace.com/2017/12/14/tangled-web-what-color-is-spider-mans-costume/\n\nI know Erik Larsen sees it as red and black: https://twitter.com/ErikJLarsen/status/944639152930172928",

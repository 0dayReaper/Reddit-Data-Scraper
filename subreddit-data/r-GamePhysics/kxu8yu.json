But spamming the cap throw button/shaking the controller to cap throw while facing the wall and bouncing on the dog gets them registered for the counter but instantly cancelled and reset so you can rack up a ton of cap throws. \n\nThe jump farming is done in the 2d ice section that has the koopas in it. Making Mario duck and go into the 1 block high gap and shaking the controller causes him to jump and hit the ground again almost immediately because of the limited space. Meaning you can farm jumps very quickly.",

So speedrunners use the opportunity here to increase the cap throw count just enough to get the moon from Toadette at the end of the run.\n\nThe stat of how many cap throws you've done is kept track of in the menus, and you can see the runner in the video clip above check the count before leaving to make sure he's on track.",

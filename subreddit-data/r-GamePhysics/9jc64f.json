It is basically this website where authors come together to create (typically horror or sci-fi oriented) entries for this fictional organization called \"The Foundation.\" These entries are presented as scientific observations of anomalous entities, events, items, and locations called SCP's, which are either being contained, guarded, or observed by The Foundation in order to protect humanity. SCP stands for Secure, Contain, Protect, which is the supposed mission of The Foundation. \n\nIt gets a bit more complicated than that once you get into the lore and the stories/tales, but that's the basic idea. Go check it out, it's full of interesting stuff.\n\nhttp://www.scp-wiki.net\n\n If you have any other questions, let me know! I know I was a bit lost when I first started poking around there.",

If you look at what happens in a game, the athletes just immediately stop and stare off into space. That's not what happens in an actual sports game. Hell, people sometimes go wide-eye and start arguing with the ref about why the call was wrong. Sports games need more things like this.",

The dissonance between what the MyCareer story tells you about your character and how they actually play is astounding. You're trash for a while and it's just not nearly as fun when you make a 3 point sharpshooter who can't hit 3 pointers. I can get being bad at other facets of the game but if you're not good at that one until you grind and grind and grind what the fuck is the point? \n\nThis coupled with the terrible story, unskippable inane cutscenes, and the neighborhood itself just turned me off. It sucks because the gameplay itself tends to be really fun...when you're using capable players. ",

On-ball defence actually matters, layups are not a complete coinflip regardless of whether you were open and the game also rewards smart play and getting open when it comes to sinking shots.",

You press one button to shoot, and the game has to factor that in with a couple of other things. It has to pretty much decide whether or not the shot goes in right when it is shot. Allowing the physics to just work out automatically doesn't really make sense, because there isn't enough input to dictate that. This simply amounts to a bug most likely. A discrepancy between what the game decided and the physics of the ball/basket.",

Seeing if the ball has velocity in one direction, finding the gradient, planning out a trajectory, then finally initializing the movement by changing states, etc, blah blah blah jargon. It\u2019s a lot of complicated equations and matrices and I don\u2019t expect them to put all of that in the game.\n\nWhich is why I think you\u2019re right. The ball nudges in such a way that it can never be stuck. This is a common practice in robotics. When an object wants to get to a certain position and it seems stuck, then there is sometimes developer code to make it move. This could be for time management, to save stack space, etc. it also gets into more precision. Assuming they\u2019ll use floats or doubles for a ball velocity, it may as well floor the estimate to zero, which changes the ball state to fly in a direction.\n\nTLDR: I build apps and robots. The game fucking cheats.",

In a livestream yesterday, people were saying it takes like 3k park games or arounf 2 1/2 seasons of mycareer to get from 95 to 96, and a lot of us don\u2019t have that much time.

God of war was great. Spider-Man was great. Shadow of the colossus looks great but I only replayed it for how pretty it was, the controls are a little janky for the games I\u2019m used to nowadays. I\u2019d definitely recommend the investment if these exclusives sound like games you\u2019d enjoy!",

No real shields or blocking, no heavy armor sets to tank damage, gothic (and later cosmic) horror setting, it\u2019s a lot changed, but every enemy in this game you can beat just by dodging and attacking. If you can learn the basic rhythm of dodge, attack, dodge, you\u2019ve got the basics down to succeed. \n\nAt a certain point of the game for me, everything just clicked. It happened in dark souls and in sekiro as well, the moment you finally grasp how your character controls, how your attacks will play out, how to time your dodges to move right through your enemies\u2019 attacks. Soon you graduate from just surviving your encounters to styling on your enemies. \n\nThe story of the game is centered around the hunters fighting back the beast plague and once you really get into the game you feel like the best hunter to ever exist in this game world. Bloodborne was the first game I ever got a platinum trophy for and I still go back to it pretty often just for the way it makes me feel as I speed my way through enemies that used to destroy me.",

If you didn't know it had been remade from scratch, you might very reasonably conclude it was a remaster.\n\nCould be mistaken as I haven't played the new one, but I had heard they basically reconstructed the entire original map as closely as possible and stuff like that",

It definitely takes some time to get used to, but if you power through it's a great experience. It's a very unique gaming experience, wherein there are only boss battles and the interim is filled by travelling beautiful environments. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously the game isn't for everyone, but if you enjoy grand experiences and fighting things that are much bigger/stronger then you and winning, it's a hype game.",

There is a button to kick, a button to headbutt, 2 left and right buttons to punch/grab, and buttons to lift your left and right hands up. That\u2019s it, and they\u2019re imprecise and unpredictable on top of that. Sometimes kicking will leave you stationary, and sometimes you\u2019ll be launched forward and inexplicably fall to your death. Some punches will knock out your opponents and some will result in your hand getting stuck behind your head. It\u2019s an excellent every-once-in-a-while party game because everyone\u2019s on a pretty level playing field when there* are 3 other people simultaneously trying to kick you and trying not to lurch off the side of the high-rise construction site that you find yourselves fighting on",

The devs have spent time on making the various controls work together so it's possible to climb and jump and get places you shouldn't. There's a lot of effort gone into making the controls handle as well as they do.\n\nThey added a 'raise arms' control by accident and found that people were using it to celebrate wins. After that, people were able to move around and climb, and it got built on from there.\n\nIt's difficult in the same way that riding a bike is difficult.",

But I would argue that in the hands of someone that does play it frequently it no longer becomes just a fun party game where others are on a level playing field.\n\nWhen you understand the physics well you build up muscle memory for movements that will basically guarantee an instantly unconscious opponent with one overwhelmingly hard punch. You just need to understand how to rubberband the character a bit.\n\nOnce this is learned it becomes impossible for anyone that can't do it to play against someone that does.\n\nIt's like playing smash bros. Great party game for casual players but you do NOT put a casual player vs someone that knows how to play it well. It's just not fair.",

Anything that is completely consistent can be learned even if it's non-standard and deviates from the norm.\n\nI've seen people jump kick consistently enough to accelerate their speed without losing any speed, repeatedly, straight into someone's face. A bit like bunnyhopping in CS.\n\nWhat the game lacks however is any consistent blocking or countering methods. It is wholly attack-based, and thus lacks the depth of most fighters because the first person to knock their opponent out-cold wins. Once a knockout hit connects then you just pick up their limp body and toss it to its doom in a grinder/cliff/pit/whatever. But the point is that it takes some skill to be able to throw those hits every single time, so a for-fun player will get smashed by a regular player very easily.\n\nEither way, every single time it gets played it results in massive amounts of shouting and fun. Best with alcohol involved and your best British football hooligan impressions.",

Thankfully the game isn't supposed to be you're supposed to struggle it's part of the charm. \n\nEverything is sticky, floaty, laggy, autoaimed punches don't always land where you want them to. This would be a knock against it if it were any other game but for a party game like Gang Beasts it's purposeful design. The silly movements is intentional. Even climbing walls is a pain and they made them slicker so you can't hold on as long as you could so you don't hide. \n\nIt's a crappy physics fighter that's more about the fun of the act themselves than winning.

It really frustrates me when I (and many others) wanna play the old style mode and they just can't add even though it's a pretty simple aspect to implement, which they've done before. If they wanna have a new mode and have it by default cool just give us the option of playing the old one too.",

When I first played, everyone had a set number of lives and if you ran out you were out for the rest of the rounds until there was a winner (it was only possible to lose one life each round, as respawning isn't a thing). The next time I played it was the stupid balloon scoring system that lasts ages between rounds. Wish it went back to the lives format.\n\nAlso, how is the fighting now? When I first played, it was pretty easy to land a jumping head punch for an instant knockout, and knockout lasted, like, 10 seconds. Next time I played, I had a very hard time knocking anyone out and when I ever did the knockout only lasted maybe 2 seconds.",

There are some other modes, but I couldn't find any matches for them. The balloon cutscene was shortened at some point so it's not as bad as it used to be. \n\nThe combat was basically like you described last time I played. It used to feel like you could actually get some results with certain strategies, but nowadays it feels completely random who's actually gonna get knocked out. ",

My nephew falls asleep to this shit.  The one time he stayed over, all I could hear was people screaming, highly distorted clipping screams, over and over again, each time some \"epic\" thing happened in the game he was watching.\n\nI mean I understand getting excited and shit but goddamn if the people I play games with scream like that they get kicked out of the house.  Like these people need to learn about VU meters.  Maybe tape a ruler to their mic with a sign that says \"YOUR FACE MUST BE THIS FAR AWAY FROM THE MIC AT ALL TIMES\"",

There's no way one could correctly abstract the atmosphere of a stream by a 6-minute segment of an extremely rare occurence in a goofy game.\n\nFirst of all, this is not a 2018 thing. Both the video and the overreaction trend. Pewdiepie and Markiplier made it popular way back then and this bit from the NLSS is from 2016. \n\nThe NLSS crew's mojo is usually ridiculously exaggerated mundane discussion, obscure referencing, mutual friendly \"bullying\" and generally just having a good time with friends. This instance, and other times when they experienced a game-breaking bug (see Who's Your Daddy gameplay), is naught but an exception to the usual ambience built in the stream, and is, as I see it, a perfectly reasonable natural reaction, not an overly artificial one, the latter sadly being what other popular channels tend to favor.\n\nI myself reacted similarly, my cheeks hurting so much from the laughter, when I got to watch that particular moment live. NL was so flabbergasted by the uncommon sight that was the minus-realm that he couldn't help but react that way. Reasonably so. There was no \"epic\" bullshit involved, no constant screaming, nothing more than just the consequences of a burst of joy that sprouted from that incident. I'm inclined to believe you're projecting your own personal generalized idea of the streaming community, which you have developed from a very small and selected sampling proccess. It doesn't apply to most streamers, let alone the NLSS crew. Whatever, guess a rotten apple spoils the barrel when it comes to preconceptuous opinions. \n\nIf you were to watch at least another video or stream from the NLSS you'll see that this was way out of the ordinary. NL is one of the most reasonable, albeit lovably stupid youtuber out there. He keeps it real, unless the game doesn't.",

Just let them have a good time as friends, or at least check out their actual content instead of judging from one compilation vid. \n\nTo be clear: in general I agree completely, but the NLSS is the dumbest possible fight you could've picked.\n\n(but also, I'll concede that Austin, one of the guys in the vid, is an ultra-expressive dude who has his mic up too loud in this instance.)",

HL2 had some narrow passages, but a lot of the levels were expansive and had a lot of action. This is more like Gauntlet and Rogue-like; search, search, search, scare, shoot, search. Interaction with the environment. The mechanics of the traditional FPS like HL2 are highly optimized for efficiently collecting ammo and shooting a lot of rounds at many targets.\n\nHL:A has more fight/flight situations where you have limited supplies and need to quickly fall back to safety and cover to regroup and reload the weapon you just depleted. The action necessary for emptying a clip, dropping it, reaching into your pack to get a new one, reloading, and chambering a round... That is the challenge of the game. Even if each of those actions were mapped to a set of keys on the keyboard, there wouldn't a challenge in rifling across R, T, Y, U, I, to perform those actions. Pressing R to reload as a single step would take away all the adrenaline moments of the game and forcing those sort of mechanics into a play style like HL2 would lose any purpose.",

It's literally just a few interactions like unjamming a door by pulling out a rod...\n\nIf this game wasn't called \"Half Life\" I don't think it would be nearly as universally praised.

Now when it comes to plates or pots and pans it's easyier because you don't have to worry about how you catch them. So basically the throwing is harder the catching is easyier.",

Like when pointing at remote items and trying to throw them towards you to grab, there is a very rigid threshold for what it wants the hand throw acceleration to be (at least on Oculus Rift).\nThis isn't a unique mechanic and  has been done better in other games.\n\nA lot of games have better-feeling shooting or some sort of unique mechanic like the zero gravity grab-and-launch-focused-navigation component in Lone Echo. \n\nSo far I think the biggest promise it may have is its SDK/assets for mods.",

It\u2019s not going to be The Matrix [\u2026] it\u2019s a movie that misses all the interesting technical subtleties and just how weird the post brain-computer interface world is going to be. It\u2019s going to have a huge impact on the kinds of experiences that we can create for people.\u201d\n\n-Gabe Newell\n\nWithin 20 years something may be possible. Until thirteen  years ago \"Smartphone\" meant you had a Blackberry with a square, 320x320px display and a 2G internet connection. You couldn't easily stream video over a phone eight years ago. Think about the paradigm shift in technology between April 2000 and now. The vast majority of people, if they were on the internet at all, were on a 56kbps dial-up connection and a 166mHz single core Pentium.",

They never acknowledged it and we never sent them a thank you note but we sure did glass Beijing,Shenzhen and Wuhan for it.   \n\nTrump's son in law Kushner is now President - dynasty politics akin to India's gandhi family really having taken off once people realised most of the country voted Republican and the Democrats refused to field anyone \"non-problematic\" 4 times in a row. Bernie died of pneumonia from a pandemic related complication in 2039. Berniebro is now considered a non politically correct term and is officially censored on disney net.  \n\nWork from home is the new standard. Restrictive gun laws finally got passed since anyone roaming outside without a permit is basically re-enacting Mad max anyways and no one feels safe.   \n\nYou know what the worst part is? Bidets have become the new normal. Trees were classified as private resource soon after Kushner got his first term and toilet paper is a trite novelty for the nouveau rich...   \n\ni remember the golden days of 2020, when everyone laughed at the toilet paper hoarders. It was my kushner-coin moon moment and i missed it.",

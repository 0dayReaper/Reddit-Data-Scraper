Something like snd_restart used to fix it and I'm not sure if it's fully fixed nowadays. There was a fixed one where if you taunted right before you fell off a ledge, you could spam the taunt a bunch and slide around. This was before the conga was added though.\n\nRight now this sliding still exists when you take out a contracker (little campaign contract device) and your character plays an animation to look at it, when you put it away quickly the character takes a while to stop looking at it and you can slide around for several seconds, causing a misleading hitbox (and you can repeat this at any point in the game). There's also one where you can spam yetis with the yeti taunts while on a moving payload or quick-switching your loadout in spawn.\n\nSo now you probably know.",

Eyewitnesses reported that a train had passed through the subway station and phased through another car without physically interacting with it in any noticeable manner. Class-C amnesiacs were administered to eyewitnesses and most were not held for further questioning.\n\nOne eyewitness claimed to have used her cell phone to record footage of the event. Her phone was confiscated and she was administered a Class-B amnesiac after adequate questioning.\n\nThe footage on the phone showed a man with a baseball cap and bandana obscuring his face. He was standing on the train and using his cell phone when the incident occurred. According to [DATA EXPUNGED] seemed to be emanating a signal similar to [REDACTED].\n\n**Addendum:**\n*He did *what* with his phone?!?*\n-Dr. Gears",

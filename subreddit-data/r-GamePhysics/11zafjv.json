I\u2019m constantly running into things like my body getting fused to the ground or ceiling when I die, my body floating and spiraling for 30 seconds when I die while in a Warthog, tanks spawning halfway inside of structures and then getting launched miles out of the map, respawn points not generating in Lone Wolves leaving the whole lobby stuck in spectator mode except one guy who wanders around an empty map looking for everyone (a literal lone wolf lmao), the narrator getting stuck in a loop where he repeats \u201cAnd this vehicle is your brush!\u201d endlessly until the game ends even though I didn\u2019t use a vehicle, the narrator saying \u201cyour team is about to score! Your team scored!\u201d when the enemy team scores in King of the Hill, the HUD only showing the score of the person in last place in King of the Hill, repulsors reversing the direction of projectiles near you even if they\u2019re your own so if you shoot a rocket and then use a repulsor within 3 seconds of firing it there\u2019s a chance it\u2019ll reverse it back at you, then shooting a canister with a Wraith crashes the game, the loss of connection to the Fireteam in the lobby that traps you in a loop of a message popping up as soon as you close the message so fast that you can\u2019t use the menu and the only way to do anything is to force quit the game and restart, and finally the \u201ccancel search\u201d button that stops looking for a new lobby but doesn\u2019t pull the \u201cfind match\u201d button back up so all you can do is click \u201ccancel search\u201d even though it\u2019s already no longer searching and even changing game modes doesn\u2019t bring the \u201cfind match button\u201d so all you can do now is just click a cancel button that doesn\u2019t even cancel anything anymore and that\u2019s not very fun after 45 minutes of clicking it",

If you ran out of ammo, the musket and fireworks launcher would be lost until the next July 4th event. \n\nThere was the trick of going into a job lobby and using the restock all ammo feature to get more though but I don't remember if that was there from the start. Now you can buy ammo though at the store and the gun.\n\nThere was also the red, white and blue tire smoke. That shit broke my Coquette and Rockstar Support refused to replace it for me.",

They want you to purchase Shark Cards for the new content they've been pushing out instead of unrealistically grinding cash to buy them. It's basically marketed as \"free\" content when it's impossible to get them in game without spending on microtransactions. \n\nI don't really like buying DLCs except for games that I see even greater value playing with DLCs and really like and support. Which means I only ever bought one DLC and that is The Division's season pass for the extra 3 gamemodes. Other than that I usually buy the base game for every game I play, no deluxe or gold edition and no additional season pass. \n\nSadly, I don't think that the new content in GTAO is worth the Shark Cards and I feel that the Online System is dated (The loading time for that game is atrocious), so after the Heist fun weaned down I uninstalled. \n\nGTA5 is one of the best singleplayer experience I had for the base game price, but Online got boring pretty quickly. I heard that there are new free gamemodes available after that but I didn't feel like reinstalling the game to play again.",

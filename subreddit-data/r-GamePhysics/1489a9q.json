This is basically like Duke Nukem 3D, with its 2D low resolution and low frame rate sprites but running 60+ FPS on modern computers. This game leans heavily in to that era of first person shooters whilst adding modern particle and lighting effects to maps that have much more complexity whilst not nearly as complex as AAA games.",

They\u2019re basically the same universe at wildly different points in time, so you have epic, grimdark fantasy or epic, grimdark sci-fi; take your pick. Or why not both? They started as tabletop wargames and grew from there.\n\nI never really got too much into Fantasy, but I consider myself a fan of 40k. Not an expert, by any means, but I love it. It\u2019s grim, it\u2019s dark; life is brutal and short for most common folk, and space is full of aliens and demons and they all want to kill everything. Turns out that warp space exists, and it\u2019s full of friggin demons. \n\nThere\u2019s not really what you\u2019d consider \u201cgood guys,\u201d just which faction you prefer. Some are more obviously evil. Personally, I love the Emperium of Man factions; Space Marines and Imperial Guard really get me going. Space Marines are hulking, power-armored super-warriors with incredible weaponry (looking at you, Bolter and Chainsword) and a serious religious fixation on the God-Emperor, which leads to much purging of heretics and burning of xenos. Imperial Guardsmen are the rank and file soldiers of the Imperium, and they have a sort of a WWI-in-space vibe to them that I find fascinating. \n\nThen you have space orks that grow from spores, space elves, *dark* space elves, undead robots (yep, you read that right,) giant alien bugs called Tyranids that will eat everything on a planet like some kind of cosmic buffet table, and more demon-warped Chaos Marines and cultists than you can shake a chainaxe at. There\u2019s more but I\u2019m running out of steam, and you probably checked out already.\n\nThe Space Marine game is a great intro and a lot of fun, and the upcoming sequel looks like it\u2019s gonna be amazing. If RTSs are more your thing, the Dawn of War games were all great, and how I got into the universe.",

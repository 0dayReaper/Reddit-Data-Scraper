I can pick up *well over* a hundred pounds, so even if we made it 100,000 times stronger, or even 200,000 stronger I could probably counter it's strength easily.",

That being said it can be a subtle effect to notice. Be glad that you don't notice it honestly :) It will make you less picky about settings. I've only noticed it in one game myself, Night in the Woods. Drove me a little buggy since the game didn't have a setting for vsync.\n\n\nAs for noticing the interlacing in this gfycat, here's a still image from it to help you out seeing the effect: https://i.imgur.com/Ksh8oag.jpg",

It's also the engine/optimization. Some games get shit fps, and massive screen tearing with vsync off, others are fine. Same with high fps.\n",

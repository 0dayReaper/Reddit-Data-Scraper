How upgrading items only adds a secondary stat (offense to defense items, defense to offense) so that new drops are always easily comparable. On top of that, the pacing in which they unlocked systems and opened up the world was really good. I enjoyed the game a whole lot more than I expected, because I usually get bored quickly in open world games like Assassin's Creed or Horizon.",

All of the bosses will ignore these tools though so just press the 'big damage' button until it dies.\"",

And you give me how many seeds for that effort?\" I'm not a fan of the reward being Weapon/Bow/Shield slots either, considering everything except the Master Sword will break in like ten minutes.\n\nSure, it can be fun to do these kinds of side activities, but when you start getting past the fifties for anything except for monetary currencies, I think it starts getting into the realm of tedium.\n\nEdit: Then again, I'm one of those weirdos who hates using any form of driving ground vehicles in most open world games and would rather be using Super Sprint, so take my opinion with a solid Salt Rock.",

It doesn't feel like a grind, because I'm actually not looking for them, I just happen to find them while exploring the map. I can't talk for TotK, but in BotW at least, you can collect them in an organic way you don't feel pressured.\n\nIt's the same thing for treasure chests and it always feel good to find a new weapon, but you have to play with the mindset that you have to use your weapons. It's counter-productive to save everything for later, as you find good weapons all the time. You can even mark on your map where the powerful ones are spawning so you can grab them easily after a blood moon.",

Sure, if it's a rock on a stick I expect it to break pretty quickly but when it's a sword as big as Link and looks to be properly forged, it should last like half an hour right??? Nope, breaks at the exact same time.",

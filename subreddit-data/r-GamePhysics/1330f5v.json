The game couldn't come to terms with the fact that you had flipped your truck on its side on a horizontal plane that was not at 0x,0y,0z  so it had to guess where the multiple pieces of the thing its been told is a car, could rationally be, computer tried to translate those coordinates and put your vehicle right side up, but instead because your Y coordinate wasn't 0 at the time of reset, the game interpreted that visually, as you being in the bridge and all other places at the same time. Kinda reminiscent of the \"goat theory\" in physics if you ask me lol.",

I do fins this hillarious, but somebody could be genuinely asking wth and why is it like this.\nWhat you're seeing is a loose simulation and because of it, it only gets as good as it needs to be to look ok from a distance. Zooming this close and looking into details was never the plan. Running a simulation for traffic with high fidelity would require most of the CPU power, and this is no GTA. Think of it like background clouds and sky in an open world rpg game - you wouldn't have those consume most of the power when there are more important things going on around you.\nI'm fun at parties.

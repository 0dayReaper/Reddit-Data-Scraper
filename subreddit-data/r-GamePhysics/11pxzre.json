I can at least say that they put more effort put in to them than the NFL games but that's a pretty low bar. It would be cool if there was more competition with other developers tho but that's easier said than done with all the licences and what not.

If you explore, you'll stumble into a traditional 40 hour video game quest line focused on saving the world. Finishing it, however, is failure because you took too long bringing home the milk. If you want to simply \"win,\" all you have to do is go to the store, buy some milk, and bring it home within a half hour.",

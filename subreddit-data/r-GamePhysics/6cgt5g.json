A common way is to store **integers** (whole numbers, i.e. no fractions) using **4 bytes**, and a **sign** (i.e. +/-). If you store a number this way, the biggest one you can fit into 4 bytes is 2,147,483,647.\n\nThis number looks pretty similar to the new world record shown on screen, so this is probably related to the bug.",

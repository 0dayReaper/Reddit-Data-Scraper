But I just tried it after reading your comment, and the RT was the problem! \n\nSo weird though! Such an odd way to compensate for a problem. Interestingly, it wasn't because the load was too much for my GPU (as I had observed before), it was just that the game, itself, is having trouble running RT.\n\nI suspected the same, but it's funny that it turned out to be true. Thanks for saying something. :)",

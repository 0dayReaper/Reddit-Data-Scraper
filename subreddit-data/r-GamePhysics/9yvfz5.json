When I stopped for a moment a player came up to me and told me he was laughing his ass off watching a noob jump around on the rooves the buildings and gave me 750 gold for making his day.\n\nI never played WoW much, but that experience stuck with me for over 5-10 years (or however long ago it was that I played) and that gold made me feel like the richest person alive.\n\nThis clip reminded me of that story.

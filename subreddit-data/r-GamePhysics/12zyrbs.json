I can tell it's not as long as say Dy8ng Light 1 or 2, to compare it. Although that's partly because the game has 6 different characters to choose all with different attributes. But as far as I know, the story is the same just with their own versions of the responses.\n\nIf it has a New Game Plus, that allows me to pick another character and redo the story but with all of my stuff I might play it a few more times. If you enjoyed Dead Island 1 and Riptide, there's no reason you wouldn't like this game too. But as far as zombie games in general go, you cannot beat Dying Light 1. You just can't. So if you're not in a rush. I say wait til maybe $50. I bought the $100 HELL.A. edition and I don't feel ripped off. So take that as you will.",

She is a sassy Latina. But when she responds/talks to others, their responses are never specific to Carla herself. I can see their responses be the same no matter who I chose. They never even call me by name. So it's definitely smart you wait.",

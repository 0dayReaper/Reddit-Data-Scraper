The game had it's moments, but most of the main characters and story progression wasn't that compelling. I also agree that more dungeon / enemy variety would have helped it too. I found myself missing the excitement of discovering new dungeons, items, enemies and bosses that the previous zelda titles gave me\n\nThat said, it's still probably the most fun I've ever had playing a zelda game",

Fleshed out would be a better complaint in that regard but even then the game is very fleshed out. \n\nI know I\u2019m in the ~~majority~~ minority but as a long-time Zelda fan the lack of dungeons just killed it for me. The puzzles were fun but after 20 of them I got tired of it. The beasts were cool but short, and the plot overall had no depth. \n\nHowever, just exploring the world and finding new ways to fuck with things was fun as fuck. I got a good 20h of entertainment just playing around with the mechanics. Unfortunately for me with SP games if I\u2019m not invested in the plot it\u2019s hard for me to keep playing. \n\nIt certainly one of the most polished games I\u2019ve ever played though. This and MGS:V both blew me away with how well everything worked mechanically. ",

Fantastic all around.\n\nAbsolution is... buy it cheap, play it once, forget it.\n\nHitman 2016 is amazing. I have praised Blood Money as lightning in a bottle, a perfect assembly of ideas and mechanics from the entire Hitman series that was subsequently and confusingly set aside when Absolution came around, but Hitman 2016.. I.. I think it's a better game. I just think they not only nailed the trial and error aspect, but the improvements to AI logic and such has really improved the overall experience. If you turn off all of the Nanny stuff like Instinct and Opportunities and all of that, Hitman 2016 feels almost identical to Blood Money in terms of wandering around and discovering potential opportunities for unique and interesting assassinations. The mood is much more light hearted and humorous which can be disappointing, but it still has some pretty great dark humor in it, and nailing someone in the head with a coconut while they're mid-sentence telling you to stop throwing things will *never* get old.",

Usually a big crowd only has ~5 real AI civilians in them so you can be spotted if you've got a gun since fake AI can't spot or do anything). You can tell who is real and who is fake by looking at the minimap - if it shows a dot then that NPC has real AI and if it doesn't show anything then that NPC is fake.\n\nAnyways, on to the videos:\n\n\n[Killing the target in complete view of a big crowd.](https://streamable.com/gnxao) Notice how the crowd AI is clapping and after killing the target about 1/4th of them freeze up, 1/4th play a scared animation (but don't run), and half of them continue clapping. At the same time the second \"real AI\" on stage has no idea about what's going on and continues his speech. Also notice how when I kill that second AI right when he finishes his speech the audience plays their scripted clapping sound. BTW Shadowplay only records for a little and I cut it short but right after it ends about 5 guards rushed my position... Apparently they could tell exactly where the shots came from.\n\nNow, you might say \"The game just broke this time\" and believe me I thought so too when I first played (I couldn't believe it was ***that*** bad) but I've discovered that I simply can't manage to get a reaction much different from this when stealth sniping the target, stealth bombing the target, or essentially doing any non-opportunity/intended assassination.\n\n#Bonus videos:\n\n[Right after the assassination and starting a massive murder spree.](https://streamable.com/ptl5e) Notice how the some of the crowd is ***still clapping*** even after the alarm goes off (BTW, IDK what triggers the alarm but its nothing more than a sound effect for atmosphere, lasts 20 seconds, and has no effect on how NPCs react or anything). Then I kill some guards in front of *another crowd* and nobody notices. BTW, I say \"another crowd\" because if you look closely you'll notice that they have ***no idea*** about what just happened 1 room over) It is only when I shoot into the crowd that they notice but don't do much anyways. Anyways, guards even start shooting at me and the crowd does nothing. It is only when shots are fired in the same room as the crowd that they react how you'd expect them to.\n\n[Actual real NPC AI being kind of wonky during the shootout after \"resetting\" it by killing all guards that were engaging me.](https://streamable.com/4inm5) Notice how after the crowd has played it's \"run away\" animation it just does nothing and stands there. Also notice how the real AI can, not only see me through the crowds, but also shoot me through them. \n\nLastly, notice how when I go out 3 real AI (cameramen) seem to run off, which leads me to believe that both real and fake AI (besides guards) seems to be tied to their respective rooms and break if anything happens anywhere else. That makes me wonder about what will happen if I just shoot the target on the stage while standing in the crowd itself (which is suicide anyways since guards can shoot through crowds). I will test and see if I get an immediate reaction from the crowd.\n\nNow, I can tell you right now that this isn't how the previous titles worked at all. Crowd AI (which in previous games was full \"real\" AI but there were much less people in a crowd) wasn't amazing but it actually did something. If you go in a room and start shooting at them a couple will run away, a couple will stand in fear and beg for their lives, and if you there are weapons on the floor (such as from dead guards) a couple might even try to run up and grab the weapon from the floor to shoot you. If you entered a room armed and freaked people out you actually had to *control* the room otherwise you risk *everyone* on the map finding out (due to stragglers) or getting killed by a bystander.\n\nEven in Absolution, which is the first game that introduced fake crowd AI the crowds would instantly react to anything public and run off (and *actually* run off and disappear from the map, not just do whatever the hell HITMAN 2016's crowds do).\n\n#Edit: \n\nHere's the video of [shooting the target from inside the crowd](https://streamable.com/ln4bt). It does get a good and the expected reaction, however, because the real guard AI can shoot through crowds it's pretty much suicide. Stealth sniping would be a much better and honestly probably more common way of assassinating the target but sadly it breaks the AI.",

The newest one (HITMAN) looks amazing but the AI is so wonky that unless you do the specific \"opportunities\" (essentially  specific intended \"questline\"-like ways of killing your target) you're going to be extremely underwhelmed and weirded out about how soul-less the game feels.\n\nFor reference I'm talking about load of fake AI (used for big crowds) that when you kill/start a shooting in public do nothing, targets do absolutely *nothing* other than walk through 3-4 rooms unless you trigger specific intended opportunity events, absolutely non-reactions from AI in general (you can literally bomb your target terrorist style and after a couple of minutes of the close by real NPCs searching around they'll reset and you'll hear them cracking jokes/talking about the target as if they're alive), any AI not close seem to never even notice that a bomb just went off a couple of rooms from them (imagine sniping someone's wife in front of a crowd &amp; guards then walking a couple of rooms over and seeing the husband and his guards just chilling), etc. Seriously you can get better reactions from NPCs in Skyrim lol\n\nAbsolution (the one before HITMAN) is actually pretty good but it's got a more linear style and the disguise system is a little broken.\n\n#Edit: Some example videos of HITMAN 2016's AI at work.\n\n[Killing the target in complete view of a big crowd.](https://streamable.com/gnxao) Notice how the crowd AI is clapping and after killing the target about 1/4th of them freeze up, 1/4th play a scared animation (but don't run), and half of them continue clapping.

If you entered a room armed and freaked people out you actually had to *control* the room otherwise you risk *everyone* on the map finding out (due to stragglers) or getting killed by a bystander.\n\nEven in Absolution, which is the first game that introduced fake crowd AI the crowds would instantly react to anything public and run off (and *actually* run off and disappear from the map, not just do whatever the hell HITMAN 2016's crowds do).",

I don't remember too well but I think the one with the most story is Absolution (which you don't own yet) but even then a lot is just not given in the games itself. It's very much a series about the gameplay with a little 10-20s flair before and after each one giving you some sort of mystery about 47, the agency he works for, etc. without much real overarching story.\n\nIt might still be worth it playing in order (so you don't downgrade in terms of mechanics and dislike them) and just skip the ones you simply don't enjoy to get to the least mechanically intense to the most. The games (especially Blood Money) are very replayable so don't worry if you start playing a couple and don't seem to like any because if you do find one you could stick with it for ages.",

I decided not to overwrite the save as I normally do specifically because it's great for showcasing the gist of the AI issues with the game.\n\nSometimes you get good reactions (such as the crowds running away when something explodes/you shoot into it) but it tends to be really finnicky. Usually you need to be IN there with them cause the mayhem for it to happen. Similarly, the targets don't go into lockdown unless you specifically target and alert *them* so even though you just blew up the entire map the target and their guards won't know a thing.\n\n---\n\n#Edit: Here are a couple of short videos I literally just took demonstrating the AI.\n\n\n[Killing the target in complete view of a big crowd.](https://streamable.com/gnxao) Notice how the crowd AI is clapping and after killing the target about 1/4th of them freeze up, 1/4th play a scared animation (but don't run), and half of them continue clapping. At the same time the second \"real AI\" on stage has no idea about what's going on and continues his speech. Also notice how when I kill that second AI right when he finishes his speech the audience plays their scripted clapping sound.

Then I kill some guards in front of *another crowd* and nobody notices. BTW, I say \"another crowd\" because if you look closely you'll notice that they have ***no idea*** about what just happened 1 room over) It is only when I shoot into the crowd that they notice but don't do much anyways. Anyways, guards even start shooting at me and the crowd does nothing. It is only when shots are fired in the same room as the crowd that they react how you'd expect them to.\n\n[Actual real NPC AI being kind of wonky during the shootout after \"resetting\" it by killing all guards that were engaging me.](https://streamable.com/4inm5) Notice how after the crowd has played it's \"run away\" animation it just does nothing and stands there.

I've not encountered a situation where I can set off an explosive without alarms going off. \n\n&gt;Sometimes you get good reactions \n\nMost of the time, in my experience. Like I said, the game breaks once in a while. It happens. Big deal. If you're playing Hitman the way it's meant to be played (trying to be stealthy), you don't run into these issues.\n\n&gt;Similarly, the targets don't go into lockdown unless you specifically target and alert them\n\nI think your game is broken dude. I blew up a fire extinguisher in the attic and sent the targets into lockdown just the other day when I was trying to do the Vampire Magician challenges.\n\nYes, the AI breaks sometimes. But you're trying to suggest that this isn't true with the older games. The AI in the older games is very rudimentary by Hitman 2016's standards, and breaks OFTEN. \n\nI mean, in Blood Money, you can bump into a guard, then run around behind them and strangle them and still achieve SA ranking. Come on. You can throw a coin and sometimes they'll just completely break and stand there and stare at it.\n\nI'm not saying Hitman 2016 doesn't have its problems but you're literally trying to put someone off from the game by making it seem like these problems are both frequent *and* worse than the problems in the old games. Which is simply not the truth. \n\nSound like your game in particular is just bugging out.\n\nNow, you said you have the game installed... so must be PC. That leads me to believe you either A) have a pirated version of the game that is just simply broken, or B) the game isn't running right on your machine and you're having issues where the game drops AI logic at times.\n\nI have only ever encountered AI breaking on the PS4 version after I've already killed about 75% of the population of a map. Then it starts to get a little messed up.",

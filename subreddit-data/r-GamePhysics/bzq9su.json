I don't know anything about NV's game engine, but I've run into these problems before where you set up a change in FOV as an asynchronous process (that is, it operates kind of in the background over time, almost like an animation), that never gets ended.\n\nWhy didn't it get ended? Sometimes the engine just plain doesn't do it because of faulty internal scheduling and checking and there's nothing you can do about it other than make sure the thread can do multiple checks to see if it needs to exit. I think more likely, however, is that the check the thread does is something like \"if time\\_elapsed &gt; 1\" which for some reason didn't hold. So like, sometimes in C and C++ functions will return -1 for failure and if the function is \"GetWeaponFOVLerpModifier(weaponID)\" and you multiple time by -1 and you forgot that function could do that or it wasn't in the spec or whatever, then now you've got a knock-on effect on you time\\_elapsed, which is part of the condition for ending the thread, which is now not going to end until you get an overflow error.",

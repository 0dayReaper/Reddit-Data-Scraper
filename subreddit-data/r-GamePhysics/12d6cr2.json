The railing isn't considered safe, so I'd wager that if you were to repeat the fall, but save and quit and then reload, you'd be at the top again. Iirc the game only measures the distance between the peak of your jump and the first piece of safe ground you touch and judges fall damage from there.",

If you started falling from a fatal height, no matter how many stops you make on the way down, or how fast you get there, you're going to die when you hit the bottom. Couple that with truly terrible platforming, and certain sections become basically unplayable (looking at you, platforms between the Cathedral of the Forsaken and the Frenzied Flame Proscription). I love the verticality of FromSoft's level design, but my god do they need some proper climbing mechanics.",

No one will do it for you. Its up to you to push past it. \n\nSome people will give up. Some will blame the game for being bullshit.

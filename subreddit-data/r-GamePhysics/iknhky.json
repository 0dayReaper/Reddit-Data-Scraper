The parkouring is really cool but it's like the game tries to take too much control of the character so you end up doing stupid shit like jumping off of buildings and splatting on the sidewalk. I want to say it was Brotherhood where they finally stopped allowing you to kill civilians with the hidden blades/sword/knife which was nice since before you'd be dick to butt with your target hit the button to assassinate and Ezio/Altair would slide 5 feet to the right to stab some poor old woman in the throat for no obvious reason. Then you'd get desynchronized because \"your target saw you\" as if I had any fucking say in the matter.\n\nOh and the first few games had this glaring issue where if you jumped on your target from behind, forcing their face into the pavement with a knife in their spine and throat, they'd sometimes \"see you\" and you'd fail because the game said you can't be seen by anyone during the mission.",

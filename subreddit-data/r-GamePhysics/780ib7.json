A static cursor where you will always hit is the best method out of all the things tried. One weird one is a dynamic cursor that moves around based on where the characters weapons are pointing. This causes the cursor to rapidly move and change size. I think Drake of the 99 Dragons used this horrible method.",

It gets even trickier since the arrow (usually unlike bullets) has physics and is effected by gravity.\n\nSay, for example, the vector is between the character (left of the screen) and, say, 30 yards away from the center of the screen. If the arrow travels farther than that it will end up right of center on the screen, and if it doesn't travel as far (it *does* fall due to gravity) it will appear left of center. This will give the player the idea that the developers intentionally made it more difficult to properly aim.",

So if you could get the the reticle on an enemy, it'll hit them no matter what.\n\nI also enjoyed the way MGSV does it. They account for the inaccuracy of the center reticle so they actually have two. A fixed one for the center where you're aiming, and a dynamic one for where the bullet's actually going to hit. So if you're aiming over something and the reticles aren't lined up, then you know you gotta re-adjust your position. I think the second one only shows up if an object's in the way though so it's not obtrusive.",

                            "comment": "\"Lazy.\"\n\nThe decision to do stuff like this is because of the off-center third person camera angles. If you follow a more...\"strict\" interpretation of the character model's firing angle, you can end up with some unpleasant-feeling \"quirks\" in the aiming that players will often be less than pleased to deal with (hello PUBG). Alternatively, you introduce a bunch of after-the-shot processing, that can result in weird delays and other issues with inconsistent performance. I forget the name of the game right now (I think it was some weird fantasy arena shooter kinda thing) but it was from the early 2000s and featured a similar over-the-shoulder firing scheme that sourced shots from the character model but would \"correct\" the shots to compensate for the off-center aim. But you could end up with absolutely fucked up glitches where in the exact situation as presented in the RotTR gif above, your character would actually turn to shoot AT the tree due to the post-shot correction favoring the obstacle.\n\nIt's all a balancing act of finding which combination of pros and cons are best in terms of making the gameplay as consistent and smooth as possible. Heck, the original Gears of War used the EXACT SAME system (and by extension, any other over-the-shoulder shooters on the same Unreal Engine) as shown above. That's why people could run past their target, fire their shotgun with the person in the middle of their screen and get the kill. Even though the actual character model and firing angle wasn't even remotely close to allowing that to happen.",

It's a simple side-effect of that fact that you are shooting from one perspective, but aiming from another. \n\nIt's something that can be acclimated to, but why should you have to? Why should the perspective itself be a challenge to overcome? \n\nEvery approach has pros and cons, but the unfortunate fact of the matter is that some of them are more intuitive and approachable than others.",

You just shoot it perpendicular to the screen plane. No changes in bullet direction required.\n\nNow if you shoot from Lara's gun, how do you make the bullet hit the crosshair (or below it)? You need to calculate the angle necessary to make the bullet hit the crosshair, and that angle depends on the depth of the point located at the crosshair relative to the camera position.",

The guns all shoot from where they're supposed to, but the actual location of the camera used to be somewhere behind the character I believe which caused all kinds of problems, so now the camera is about chest height. Which means when you go to loot houses, the door knobs are near eye level from the player's POV.\n\nAlso makes knowing where your barrel actually is sort of weird and difficult to fire out of windows because almost every single window has bars on it.\n\nEdit: Actually someone else has explained what causes this in a child comment. While I'm unsure what originally happened, the camera is now in the head but BlueHole didn't scale the buildings correctly so your character seems weirdly short.",

It seems like they talk about doing a lot, but actually does jack shit. There's probably two people working on the game actively, the rest is in the cafeteria circlejerking on why they can't update the game with in-house assets or even release simple hotfixes and patches. Why not just fucking make the maps 30% smaller with 30% less players, so the game is actually playable in the first 10 minutes. The list is fucking endless on the solutions other people would come up with, PlayerUnknowns solution is to make another fucking map the exact same size. This fucking server solution they have managed to throw together obviously can't handle 100 people on such a large map so why the hell do they try and force it?\n\nPUBG is a fucking dumpsterfire and in about one years time there will be less than 100k playing it. The fucking PlayerUnknown guy is one of the most unreliable designers in the industry and people went off the hooks for an unfinished game by this dried up green grape. I hope this motherfucker never touches another game again, because most of it turns into pure unadulterated piss in a few months.\n",

            "comment": "Definitely a case of gameplay feel trumps realism.\n\nImagine for a moment that the tree was an enemy you wanted to hit.  You can either allow aiming the reticle at it and firing at it to work, or you can disallow it because Lara technically cant hit it without turning around.  If you choose the latter option, you are doubling the cognitive workload of the player, forcing them to track both whether they can see the target and whether Lara can see it.  They would have to rotate the character and camera 90 degrees away from the action to shoot that one enemy that came up on the side, and then rotate all the way back around toward the action afterward, which would feel unresponsive, clunky and disorienting.\n\nIn theory Lara\u2019s animated pose could aim at whatever point the reticle is currently aiming at.  However, she should generally be aiming in the same direction as the camera is facing, and in this case those goals are mutually exclusive.  Not only would turning around and firing toward the camera be incredibly jarring, you would also get a horrible dance if you decided to strafe and branches passed into and out of view.  The motion of the reticle landing point is in general discontinuous, which is exactly the opposite of what you want for good character animation.\n\nGames can and do work hard to hide the discrepancy between where shots actually come from and where they realistically should come from.  When a slow moving projectile is fired, it can have the visible model spawn at the gun while the hit box spawns at the reticle, and the render geo can travel along a curve that aligns it with the hit box after a few frames.  But preventing the projectile from actually hitting what the camera is aiming at is generally considered to do more harm than good.",

However, a lot of people in this thread are suggesting that it works this way because the devs were \"lazy.\"\n\nEspecially in a single player game, **this is not because of laziness**.  Any other mechanic* would just be confusing and frustrating for the player.  In a multiplayer game, consistency of animations and bullet/arrow firing mechanics is important because opposing players need to be able to react to each other, but in a single player game you want the most intuitive mechanics possible, even at the expense of physical consistency or \"realism.\"  If the situation in this clip was reversed, and the player was aiming at an enemy but the post was in front of the bow, it would be frustrating and *less fun* if the arrows kept being blocked by the post even though the player had a clear line of sight to the enemy.  *That* is why the developers made this choice, probably after lots of discussion by professional game designers.\n\n*Other mechanics might be:  \nProjectiles are fired from the bow to the point being looked at by the camera (reasonable, might lead to frustrating gameplay).  \nReticle is dynamically traced to indicate where projectiles (fired from the bow model) will hit - like a laser sight (reasonable but complicated/unintuitive for a single player game).  \nProjectiles are fired from the bow model parallel to the camera (I would consider this lazy, and it would be garbage to play).  \netc.",

It's just so that in general, it is easier to allow the player to hit anything they put their reticle on.\n\nOne noteable game that does the \"right\" way (bullet coming from weapon itself) has plenty of people complaining they hit doorframes or window frames when it appears they got a clear line of sight. Because the bullet comes out lower than where the camera or the sight is.\n\nCS:GO for example have the bullet coming from the players eye/head instead.",

Instead the direction would constantly change. In this instance, she'd be aiming directly behind her at the tree.\n\nYou'd also try and shoot things and be blocked by obstacles in her bow's path, but not the camera's path, which would be confusing to deal with.",

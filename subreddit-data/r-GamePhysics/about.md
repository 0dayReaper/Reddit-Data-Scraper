Description:

Gifs and videos of game physics and glitches

Rules:

Post the game's name in [brackets] at the beginning of your title.: 

No generic highlights of something cool done in game.: 

If you can, source the video your gif is from.: In addition, if you did not record the clip yourself and found it on another site before uploading it to reddit (i.e. YouTube, Twitch, etc) you must post the source. Give credit to the creator.

When reporting, add a reason.: If you report a link, please message the mods a link to the comments section as well as the reason you reported the link.

Don't repost/copy other posts.: Don't repost something if it's been posted within the last 2 months. If you're unsure if something's already been posted, search for the game name in the search bar. If a bug remains unfixed, still occurs in an identical fashion/location AND is regularly posted by users it will be considered to be too common and any second clip featuring this bug posted within the rolling two month period will be removed. For the full list consult the "list of overly common bugs" at the bottom of the sidebar.

x-posts are allowed, but please tag it with [x-post from (subreddit)].: 

Please Only submit your posts using YouTube, Imgur or Gfycat links.: Please try to only submit Youtube, Imgur, or Gfycat links otherwise your post might get caught in the spam filter.

INDIE DEVELOPER RULES: If you are an indie developer with a WORK IN PROGRESS, you may only submit one post during that stage of development. Other users may not submit any posts of your WIP after this point either. If your game is RELEASED, you may again only submit one post for this stage. You are required to indicate that the game is released in the comments, with proof provided. Released titles can be freely posted by other users but any further dev posts at this stage will be treated as advertisement and removed.

Must be glitches or physics: All submissions must either be glitches or demonstrate notable physics, either of the good variety or bad. If your submission pertains to something mundane that happens during standard gameplay it is not acceptable. The key is whether the physics is noteworthy, unusually detailed given the type of game, or using interesting new tech (the latter is mostly for indies and upcoming games). If you have questions about this consult the "understanding physics" section of sidebar or message the mods.

Game post limit: A user may only submit posts from the same game twice per week. So, for instance if a user posts a Far Cry clip on Monday and then Tuesday they cannot submit another Far Cry clip until the next week. They can, however, post a Fallout clip on Wednesday, for instance. If the same user is spamming posts from the same game throughout the week, report using this rule.

AI flaw: Do not post funny/dumb NPC moments (i.e. "it must have been the wind" type clips). These are AI issues and have nothing to do with glitches or the physics engine. Pathfinding issues where the AI can't figure out how to correctly navigate the environment (walking/driving into walls, running in circles, etc) are not appropriate. The exception to this is if the NPC is being funny in the middle of a collision/physics glitch (for example: they are spaghettifying but also casually talking still).

Low effort: For the health of the sub, any low effort posts (phone recordings, image posts/screencaps, low quality videos where it is difficult to see what is happening, overly long clips that should have been trimmed--i.e. 30 sec with 3 sec of glitch at the very end) will be removed. Whenever possible, please use proper recording software or screen capture abilities. These are built into all modern consoles with companion apps often being able to upload to reddit from your phone and PCs have many options.

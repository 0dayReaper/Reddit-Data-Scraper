Vehicles don't really count as a plus to me since the mod had vehicles from the very start... to this day, most people I've heard say DayZ mod is much more fun to play than the standalone game. \n\nThe game obviously has some improvements over the mod, but comparing DayZ to Star Citizen is what's disingenuous in my eyes. Yes, Star Citizen has(and will continue to) take a long time to develop, but Star Citizen changes massively in the span of a year, whereas it took DayZ years to even catch up to mod it was based on. That's why I don't like when people say \"at least DayZ released\" because Star Citizen changes faster and in more positive ways(er, usually lol) than DayZ has/did.",

I don't think it's a stretch to say they know keeping to that language allows them to sell far more expensive content than a typical Early Access game could get away with. Or even fully released titles for that matter. \n\nBesides being manipulative, it's also tangibly harmed the game's design. They have to keep adding new things to keep that cash model rolling regardless of how it will work. I recall the moment I lost patience was when they unveiled a \"medical ship\" for sale with its intricately designed medical bay area, and then said \"we don't know what medical gameplay is actually going to be like yet\".",

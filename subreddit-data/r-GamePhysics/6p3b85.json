Clear the track, get straight to triage, and the most intervention you should perform on any one patient until such a time as you have enough units to deal with the incident is to tilt their head to assess respirations and put a tourniquet on where needed. To only treat only one patient would be to deny everyone else who needs it care.",

It's a lot more of a simulator than a game (great physics, tons of car setup options, full pace/caution laps, user-controlled pit speeds, etc), but once you get the hang of it, and get yourself involved in the community and the modding (tracks, cars, etc), it's really a ton of fun.\n\nIf you download it (incredibly easy to get it for free), make sure to download and install [the 1.2.0.1 patch](http://www.shaggycentral.net/ITDH/downloads/dl.htm) if you want to mod it (plus it fixes some bugs).",

The car you see going on is different than the car that is used to calculate colission and different than the car that is used to calculate car handling and is different than the care that is used to calculate physics. When you drive the car isnt being given kinetic energy, it is being literally slid across the texture at certain speed and angle with 0 energy in physics calculation until the car hits something and then its potential energy is calculated.\n\nMoving everything in a game by physics to begin with is very resource intensive and while some games are coming out that try to do it at least partially, it always 2d only and very limited in objects themselves.\n\nThe way they actually prevent the physics engine from spazzing out is create dampening and hard limiters. For example if car cannot drive at 500 KM/h then in any circumstances that car is being moved it would be hard-limited at 300 and would override physics calcuation. That of course is a fucking messing and hard work to do given off the shelft physics engines.",

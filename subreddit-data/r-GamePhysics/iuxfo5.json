Because of situations like this video, but also because those checks would be easy to get around. If you know the threshold for \"impossible\" qualification time then you can get around it easily by just waiting until 1 second after the cutoff time. \n\nThe real solution is to do low-level checks on player input every server tick. Much more reliable, efficient, and you don't have to worry about endless exceptions and edge cases like players incidentally being launched by physics objects. The catch is that this needs to be done on the server, but fall guys - at least before the most recent patch - did all these checks on the client, so cheaters were able to easily disable them. That's a big no-no in gameplay networking.",

It's purely by chance. If something bonkers happens to other players, good or bad, I don't view it as a slight to me. So long as they're not hacking then it's simply a part of the game.",

In this game, you hit a wall and bounce. \n\nExcept, the bouncing isn't quite right. You bounce farther than you should. So if you bump into a moving object, and that object is mostly unstoppable, your character bounces *and* takes whatever speed/force that object had. So, you go flying. Momentum is not conserved. It increases. \n\nThis is why players are able to launch themselves off of hammers and other map pieces. Hitting moving things is *supposed* to send you flying farther than if you had just been pushed.\n\nIn this case, it looks like he bounced off another player, and hit a piece of a door. I can't quite tell, but it looks like that door piece hit a wall and the ground, as the player ran into it. So, what I *think* we're seeing is the force of a double- (maybe even a triple) -bounce.",

I assume they clipped into the door and the game tried to add velocity to the character and the door, for some reason both in the same direction, to get them unstuck. You can see that they remain clipped together for a few frames as it accelerates",

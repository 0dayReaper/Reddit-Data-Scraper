The issue is you bought an unfinoshed game for full priced when you were supposed to be buying a triple a title. The argument isn't about wether the game is good or bad. It's about why we're being sold trash and why people are jist eating it up. \n\nCyberpunk was a shit show and it went through exactly the same debates about it's a good game but it's buggy as hell. Bethesda is really the only company I wouldn't complain about buggy games because you know when buying a bethesda game that it's gonna be broken and more importantly, there's a dedicated modding community that is garunteed to fix any issues. No one is fixing the issues on something this gane until the devs decide to fix it later once people have already paid for what they were told was a fully working game",

But because the majority of people see this game has deeply, deeply flawed with absolutely zero soul, no story telling, incredible amounts of bugs, performance issues and just a flat out boring game that tried riding the hype of the 'looter shooter' without understanding the genre... does not mean that you are right and they are wrong.\n\nPeople are allowed to have different opinions. You're welcome to enjoy what you enjoy, but don't go around telling everyone that they are wrong for seeing this game as absolute dogshit, and then complain of the 'hive mind' when people call you out.\n\nResponding to numerous threads in the same post with the same thing is tantamount to flaming as well. You're not here to say you're having fun (otherwise it would have just been one post), it's clear that you're here to try and wind people up.\n\nHere's a tip though... go and play Dishonored 2, or Prey... and then play this game. It's a world of difference. And those games don't cost you $70.",

It's because fans of the game give them endless lengths of rope and a higher and higher stool to stand on.",

Didn't have any major bugs and it ran ok ish. Just boring. \n\nShame because the concept is kinda cool. It just had no soul. Shooting mechanics are really unsatisfying. \n\nLast game I play that was a little like this was probably Far Cry 5 and I did fucking shit loads of hours in that.

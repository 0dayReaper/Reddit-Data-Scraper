The physics engine resolves a specific event \u2014 like hitting a railing at a specific angle and speed \u2014 the same way every time. So you can build tracks that abuse this, by keeping the car going around a convoluted series of jumps, loops, and midair flips, as long as you hold the accelerator and don't steer.",

OnTouch only registers first touch in the source engine.",

I assume this exploits some stabilizing subroutine that triggers when a laser is going through a block, making it less fiddly. Something like \u201cif lasered and let go and not pulled by gravity, keep this block steady unless acted on by the player or the level\u201d. This command makes perfect sense, until you do what\u2019s shown in the video.\n\nVery cute lil bug.",

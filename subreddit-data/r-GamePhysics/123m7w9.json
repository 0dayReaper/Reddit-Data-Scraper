GTA V might have Moe stuff to do and more hours to sink in, but there is still a lot to do in Cyberpunk. Not to mention if you\u2019re playing on PC at least, game does t run to bad and there aren\u2019t really any game breaking bugs",

I had zero game breaking bugs during the play throughs, and that's with me adding over 100 mods as well. **However, I do have to agree, there is a bit of lifelessness to the city.** It's very uncanny Valley how the game world reacts to your decision making. The NPCs on the street truly DGAF what you do/no variance to their reactions. The pathing is super obvious as well. You can guide NPCs like sheep with shooting or pointing a gun in a specific direction.\n\n**The other issue I think is the NPCs don't have anything to really do besides walk, stand, or drive**. There's some shopping in districts, but there's no complexity beyond that. Having the same, nameless drones standing in the same spot day in day out doesn't make sense for a game made in 2020. There's little \"life\" to the city because most people stand on the same street corner or apartment lobby. Hell, for a playthroughs with 150 in game days I saw the same police officer talking to the same two apartment residents every single day in the same spot. They weren't quest related either, just placed there. While a much smaller population, and not truly being open world, the STALKER Anomaly mod (gamma is my preference) tends to be more true to real NPC movement. NPCs will travel between areas, have opinions of you, and actually die off screen. There's more weight to your actions and decisions from a game well over a decade old and a volunteer mod team compared to cyberpunk.\n\n**Only a small portion of buildings are able to be entered**. Unless it's a shop, or quest line affiliated, the majority of buildings are just blockades on a street. I get that it's a heavy task to add stuff like that, and this map is quite large. But it's a city. A city where you can't access the majority of the buildings. This just adds to the issue of NPCs not doing realistic things. There aren't many instances where NPCs go from one area to another. Sure, walk around a block, but how often have you seen an NPC go from the street to a food stall to an apartment complex? I honestly cannot remember seeing that at all. Like I said, the pathing is mad predictable, and the lack of open buildings only makes it worse. \n\n**Finally, the police system as of 1.62 is mad broken**. You can get the highest level of wanted, be labeled a cyber psycho, have maxtac called on you, and walk away from it no consequences if you kill them enough**. There's no lasting reprocussions at all, and I know this, because I went one punch man multiple times on maxtac multiple times. This doesn't feel like a real reaction, and drives down the immersion for sure. Older games have done a better job of keeping consequences to your actions, which is disappointing you don't see it in 2077. It doesn't make sense either that there isn't a morality measurement or a city wide/borough wide wanted system. Considering the game and anime both talk about getting too big for your britches, and a bigger fish will come along and eat you up if you stand out too much, it's just weird how little Night City and the gangs/police/corpos don't give a single flying fuck what you do as long as you drive 2km away. Shit, not even a hit squad sent on you or anything. \n\nIt's a great game for what you can do with your character, and I found the storyline compelling. I loved the setting, and the named NPCs had depth. You had to make some really tough decisions at some point, which was great. However, to me at least, Night City seemed like it was a simulation, almost like Neo in the Matrix looking around and realizing no one was real. \n\nThanks for reading my Ted Talk \n\nTl;dr it's a fun game with great characters and story, but the City the game is centered around feels lifeless and is immersion breaking.",

Also huge difference between a game being buggy and a game being bad. A game being bad because it\u2019s buggy, can be a short term thing if the company fixes it. Like I totally expect people who played Cyberpunk on PS4 to think it\u2019s a bad game because it runs like shit on it.

I LOVE it when a game tries to pull something off and fails spectacularly! I cackled like a witch when I saw my first dragon in Skyrim propel itself across the sky on a fart of flames!\n\nMy point, which you are either willfully ignoring or cannot seem to grasp, is that after 2 years of bugfix patches, I expect to be able to at least get through the first cutscene without something like that happening.",

Cyberpunk is a demanding game and using an SSD for it will help significantly, yet it's still the developer's responsibility to make a game run smoothly regardless of drive, if your system has the required specs of course.\n\nAnd even then, there's plenty of bugs and jank in the game regardless of drive speed. I'll maybe buy Cyberpunk again when all the updates have dropped and it's on a steep discount, plenty of other, better games to play.",

I remember gtaV did cost a ton of money to make, but they covered they cost in the first weekend after launch if I remember correctly. They didn't have to reimburse millions of users however. I also didn't know that the studio of made cyberpunk had another very successful franchise in the Witcher.\n\nNext time I'll just Google instead of trying to exchange on a forum...",

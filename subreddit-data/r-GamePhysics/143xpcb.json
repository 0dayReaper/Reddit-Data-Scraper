The larger gaming community at large has moved on from it, leaving only the fans who have invested a lot of time and money into it. These people have been on the ride for years, buying ships and playing the hell out of features that have been drip fed to them. Unless there is a point where CIG goes dark to release a huge content update for an \"official\" launch, what difference will it make for long-time fans? If there is just another incremental update with the version number of 1.0 slapped on, will long-time players be worried that it means there'll be no more meaningful content? And how many new players would an official launch really attract? If you're not already down the rabbit hole, do you really trust CIG to provide a holistic gaming experience for $70 when they're accustomed to customers who drop thousands? Will you want to enter a world where there are already thousands flying around using end-game content? I'm not sure.\n\n\nI honestly think their current course is the best one. Just keep on repairing your ship of Theseus and bringing on new sailors. Adding and adding until no one is willing to fund it. Hello Games has made a good go of it using a somewhat similar model to that. They're going on year 7 of free updates to the base game.",

Never spent another dime on it and I got hundreds of hours of playtime which I enjoyed. \nHow is that a scam?  I've bought games on steam for the same price and played then once and hated them. I don't consider that a scam.\nIt's not like it's a secret that star citizen isn't complete",

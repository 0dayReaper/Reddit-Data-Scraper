But I do know Unity runs on top of Mono 2.6, which is outdated. \n\nPlus, having mono is a disadvantage by itself because having a just in time compiler will cause more overhead at runtime. Your application actually runs on top of another application which manages the memory and local instructions for the computer. Creating an application on top of a JIT takes overall less time to create, especially when it's cross platform such as Mono. But it has of course it's trade offs, by losing speed and if you want to stay cross platform less freedom. \n\nIf you want more in depth information, those wikipedia articles explain much more about JIT and Mono:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_(software)\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)\n\n",

The game may take longer to load, but it should be decent at runtime. Plus C# is a compiled language too, so you get both compile-time optimisation and targeted JIT. The GC is the real problem and will ruin performance if you don't know what you are doing, but can be minimised \n\nThe performance problem with Unity isn't C#, it's Unity itself.",

Same thing with the SWAT teams actions. They're far better than they were in 4, yet you hardly see it because you're fighting in the open. I holed up inside the Suburban like I used to in that GTA IV hospital, and started fighting off the police. When the SWAT did come in, they actually threw tear gas inside and landed it close enough to me to successfully flush me out of my cover. I was honestly blown away at how well they tossed it, too because I was so used to the idiots who'd just walk right into the line of sight with no actions that even suggested they were trying to flush me out. Sure, it's still not perfect, but it wouldn't be fun if it was.",

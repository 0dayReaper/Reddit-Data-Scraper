It has been servicing riders for a week. \nThis is what liberal controlled Milwaukee gets at the same time there is a water pollution problem that could soon rival flint Michigan and millions of gallons of raw untreated sewage being dumped about 1 dozen times a year into our beautiful Lake Michigan. Yep that is MKE right now",

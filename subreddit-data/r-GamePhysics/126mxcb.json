Essentially every pixel has it\u2019s own physical properties (burn health, acid resistance, viscosity) as opposed to traditional particle effects that are strictly visual. \n\nIn this game you manipulate the environment by playing cards. Each pixel can can burn, melt, freeze, corrode, etc. It can make for some pretty wild chain reactions if you play your cards right.\n\n[Infest was just announced](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2341560/Infest/) and I\u2019ll be releasing a demo soon. Full release is scheduled for later this year :) Cheers",

I used to play an app game like this where its just a sandbox to fuck with different elements.\n\n\nThere was a dirt element, and if you poured the water element itd start growing green pixels meant to be plants, and then red ones cause those to burn.\n\nIt was pretty cool, you could kinda make self perpetuating shapes and such kinda like the game of life type thing. Where the water is just enough to keep extinguishing the flames but still keep the flames alive by growing more green. \n\nIt was fascinating and I spent way too much fucking with it. \n\nThis shit was on my galaxy S1 so this was a long time ago lol\n\n\nPerhaps you already have some ideas like that?",

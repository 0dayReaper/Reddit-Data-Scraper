I'm not even going to explain the interactions with other players, that'll be a happy surprise you should experience on your own.\n\nIf you're feeling lonely, join any game easily via your in-game mobile through 'Quick Play' option and chose any type of activity you'll like to participate with our wonderful community and then all you have to do is wait ... wait .. a little more .. 7/14 Lobby ... wait ... 8/14 ... just a bit I promise .. 12/14 .. see! .. waaait ... 14/14 ... See! Like a glov- *You have been Kicked out of this session* \n\nUh-oh, it looks like there was a problem with the session, no problem. Just try again, it works almost 7/5 times. Now, while you're waiting, why don't you just roam around watch that amazing blimp with X-Wings flying with a jet booster propulsion engine. Oh my would you look at that, an Orangutan is in the cockpit. \n\nHere in GTA:Online we work on the principles of Anti-racism, so we give every single race an equal opportunity, that's why the whale you see outside of your Ammo store has equal rights to that road as the lion driving that SUV.\n\nThe best thing about GTA ... you don't have to work. Just walk around in lobby and suddenly the money would just start dropping on you, out of thin air! I swear on my 15429th grave.\n\nWell that enough of the tour of our wonderful world. Have a nice day and I hope I'll see you soon in ^^^^^^~~hell~~ GTA:Online.",

You can start doing those heists right away as soon as you start playing the game. You'll even get more money for finishing them for the first time.\n\nI've had more than 700hrs clocked in, the highest of any game I've ever played and almost all of it was with friends. Yes, it can really get pretty boring when you're playing alone, but add one or two people and you've got a healthy amount of chaotic fun in the mix, like doing nothing but roaming around, getting 5 stars and picking up a bus with a challenge to get it up to Mount Chilliard (highest mountain) is a blast.",

Now everyone is high level with billions dropping bombs on anyone not in the party.  GTA 4 was fun because a lot of times you couldn't find someone until you heard cops coming for no reason as a Comet races by guns a blazing.  Even then, the interactions were so genuine and mostly, in my experience, ended with the server joining together against cops or just doing dumb shit like holding up an intersection or role playing.

The idea was you would drag race through downtown in the middle of the night and fly through intersections while traffic was low and the police were occupied.  On the harder levels, they would time a white van to ALWAYS collide with your car, to the point of having to memorize when you got hit last restart and slam on the brakes before the van appears and swerve.\n\nA bit cheaty, but lots of games cheat on the hard difficulties.  I remember doing a surprise pass play on the one yard line in madden and the other team would move into the dime defense, which only prevents passes and is idiotic on the one yard line, and my quarterback would just walk the touchdown in.",

It's similar to the Mechanic vehicle delivery spawning system, where it will only spawn the \"T-bone\" car where ever the player camera isn't currently looking (like behind blind corners).\n\nI have no source to confirm any of this, but I have been studying the NPC patterns &amp; habits for a long time now. \n\nWhenever you're driving full speed, try paying attention to the cross traffic ahead of you. Y'know how NPC's normally drive 10 under the speed limit, on surface streets, 99% of the time? \n\nWhen going full throttle &amp; approaching a red light, every now and then, you will witness a random cross-traffic NPC car doing like fucking 60 across the intersection. If you manage to avoid this NPC, try paying attention to their behavior immediately after. \n\nAlmost ALWAYS after they clear the intersection, they will slam on the brakes and resume their previous \"drive under 40mph\" script. Sometimes you can notice little micro-warps (they will speed up or slow down in a unnatural manner) as the script is trying to position them just right, in order to ensure the crash.  \n\nThis script will also cause them to divert from their normal course, if it means causing you inconvenience. If you're driving down the middle of the street, suddenly you will notice every other NPC suddenly get the \"urge\" to hop into the turning lane. Usually in a micro-warping, unnatural manner. If you try to pass a car up on the right, they will suddenly get the urge to make a right turn etc. \n\nUsually you can catch the game itself \"cheating\" and spawning these cars in, using Rockstar Editor. I think it was originally a hold over from last-gen, in order to keep you from reaching top speed too often, in order to hide the severe pop-in issues on PS3/360. Like many other things that were overlooked, Rockstar never bothered to revise or remove it, for current-gen. \n\nAs a person who is super-passionate about driving, this is the number 1 thing I hate about the game, and will probably never be able to 100% enjoy the driving aspect of it, because of this shitty design decision. \n\nSeriously, fuck the Rockstar employee that decided to implement that script. \n",

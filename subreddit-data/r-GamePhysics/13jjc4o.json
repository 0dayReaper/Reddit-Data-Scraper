            "comment": "Hi everyone! We're Catobyte, an indie game dev team. Our game Super Bunny Man has just launched out of Early Access after 6 years in development. The gif here is from the new update's 'world 5' levels. The game is available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/673750/Super_Bunny_Man/) right now.  \n\n\n[We posted in GamePhysics 6 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamePhysics/comments/6nlvj7/super_bunny_man_karma/), and it helped launch our game's community. Our game has always embodied the spirit of wacky game-physics bug and physics-related improbable and unfortunate accidents \ud83d\ude06  \n\n\nThank you /r/GamePhysics community! \ud83c\udf89",

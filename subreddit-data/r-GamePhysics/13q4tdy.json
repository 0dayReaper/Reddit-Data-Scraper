I was playing Control along TotK and, despite Control not having a lot of physics based gameplay it still has great destructible environments that make the game feel much more natural. I was talking about it with a couple of friends, too many games nowadays neglect physics, and for me a good physics engine makes a game look better and more realistic than outstanding visuals only.\n\nIt's a shame because back in the mid 2000s it seemed like games were going to go big on physics, think Half-Life 2 or Red Faction: Guerrilla. I hope TotK will give developers the inspiration to include better physics and more physics-based mechanics in their games, and not only limit those to one-off projects or indie games.",

Teardown has novel voxel destruction but it does not have functional free form devices like this. I don't know of any flexible bodies in that game. \n\nBesieged kinda does, but I don't think that game features chain or ropes that can interact like this unless it was added recently. If someone can design, like, a functional chain using that system that's cool but besieged is basically solo focused on that kind of interaction and it is also pretty exceptional in its physics rendering. I\n\nNobody denies these things *can be done,* but when have you seen it in a game that's not a tech demo? Because your examples don't establish this as normal at all. \n\n&gt;Because most games get developed to fit an a thing it\u2019s rare developers get given free reign to do it\n\nSo given that's the matter, it's clearly unusual and not normal - that it is actually pretty exceptional to see in a game. \n\nIs there a reason you can't seem to bring yourself to simply agree with that sentiment?\n\n&gt;I am a developer myself \n\nThat might explain the needlessly contrarian behavior, but why can't a developer pick up on the fact that this function did not exist in HL2 in any capacity?",

It\u2019s not that any one of these details are particularly amazing in their own right, but the fact that the usual shortcuts haven\u2019t been taken and it still runs fine is what\u2019s mind blowing about it.",

We've had games capable of doing this for years.\n\nThe reason most games don't do it is because it's not necessary. For TotK, physics it's a main feature of the game so it makes sense for them to use it.\n\nBut for games like, I don't know,  Resident Evil, Uncharted, Assassin's Creed, etc. They can just make up an animation for opening doors , and often time it's more stylized.",

The video is more a \"if you know, you know\" video... which admittedly isn't great for the discussions in here.\n\nUltimately, the reason I find one more impressive than the other is the difference between canned scripts and physics simulation.",

It\u2019s hard to determine the actual tank control mechanisms from the clip but this could be fun as either a (1) live run and gun tank shooter or (2) a turn based strategy shoot, duck, and roll with limited move distance. A live version might need to have bigger terrains. A small map turn based game would be so fun though. Anticipate, read the enemy, obliterate. ",

Are there any plans for different maps? Like some sort of arena with a holes in odd places so you can come up with a strategy to push the other player towards it, or a multi-level arena and then you blow out the floor from under your opponent. Also, is this for mobile or steam? Regardless, it looks incredibly fun, well done to you and your dev team :) ",

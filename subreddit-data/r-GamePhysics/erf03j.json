The other fun game we enjoyed was \"a way out\" a cinematic game (i.e you do feck all the whole game just mash the odd button and a bit of walking) where you break out of prison and go on the run. It was really unique and fun",

Whatever. Get rid of 'em. There's no real hp to keep track of, you just get knocked unconscious if you take enough shots, and seem to pop back up at \"full\" after a few seconds.\n\nUp to ~~four~~ five? players can play.

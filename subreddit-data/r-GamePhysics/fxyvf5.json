Issue is many out of bounds exploits are just walking in an empty void or beating the game in no time. I oike it when the games have a kill zone so there's this narrow spot out of bounds that's safe and as such it allows for at most getting past certain barriers early/as the wrong character",

Normally when you fall off the track, you're moving away from it, but here it happened at the very end of a drift as the bike was moving parallel to the track, and as he turns, you can actually see the front wheel clip through it. At that moment, the game probably went \"Oh he's falling through the floor, let's put him back up\" and the rest is history.",

It was Mario's nose that triggered it. \n\nThe track is actually flat but not drawn that way for increased performance. You can see as he was entering, the wheels were already clipping.  The game thought he was off track, but then when part of the model (his nose) hit the track the game thought \n&gt; \"Oh shit he's not falling, part of the model just hit the top side of the track!  Could have swore a moment ago he was off to the side and not touching the top, but that's not possible if part of him just hit the top side,  I better correct it!\"\n\nEdit: more info, if this isn't clear, from responding to the conment below\n\n&gt; Thats the clipping I was talking about. It's level with the main track. \n\n &gt; Notice his nose at the level the wheels were clipping the raised side. The raised side is just drawn raised, the actual track model is flat and low polygon for preformance. \n\n&gt; Also since it's curving and the track model is much simpler than what the shaders draw (again, the proof is the wheels staying level with middle of track, raised side is only drawn that way), it's likely his nose hit a vertex of what is actually a jagged side.",

Basically a ray is cast from the wheel hub out through the contact patch of the tire to determine how far away the ground is from the contact patch. Ray cast tests are very fast and simple to do. The game probably has logic to prevent the player from falling through the ground by warping them up to the surface if they are below it. This track probably has a 'you lose' plane below the track that when crossed makes you die, but if you manage to get back on the track before you hit that, you're ok.",

In destiny being almost dead triggers for you to take less damage, and make enemies aim worse. In dead cells you don't fall off if you are a few pixels too far. Then they just teleport you to the platform. This might be a similar situation here. Because if the player makes small mistakes they're less likely to play. But again i didn't make mario kart\n\n-source 3rd year game design student, so basically an expert on nothing",

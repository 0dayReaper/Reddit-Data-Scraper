The rest of the post is still the same). However, that isotope has all the same properties as uranium otherwise. So you can't separate the lightest isotope of uranium through a chemical or physical reaction. The only way to do so is vaporize the uranium and spin it very very fast. Just from physics, the heavier uranium isoptopes will push the lighter isoptopes out of the way. This is a bit of a gross oversimplification, as each enrichment process only slightly improves the quality, so you have to do a large number of times. It's both energy and cost an incredibly expensive process. This is why it's pretty much impossible to make a nuke without people knowing you're making a nuke, because of how much energy and technical apparatus it takes.",

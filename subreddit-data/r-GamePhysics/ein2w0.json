He said, \"look look it's like a free massage chair\" as he laughed it off. A few moments later is when things really got bad. He started screaming \"I can't dismount the chair\". Before I could even register what was happening, the table started getting stuck in the floor. Next thing I know, he's 1000 ft in the air and the BAM. A flatlining sound. The sad thing is that the table is still violently shaking to this day. The local government quarantined it into an abandoned warehouse. We could never recover the ragdoll.",

Havok is very quirky when you just slap it onto every object in your world without care. Half Life 2 uses Havok and you don't see things launching into space anywhere near as often because they actually took the time to implement it properly.",

If you always move objects by their rigidbody and have the proper physics settings two solid colliders will never be able to intersect. It appears either Bethesda\u2019s engine is sloppy about updating physics components or the programmers were lazy when moving objects at runtime.",

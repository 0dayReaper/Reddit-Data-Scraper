I really like the level design from D1, but if you look at the story telling from game to game, D1 is just good, D2 is pretty great, and D3 gets really weak at times due to all its heavy ties to D1, and it's inability to help sell you on how the universe of Dark Souls actually works (except the very beginning and end of the game are both pretty great)\n\nLike, jumping a nondescript amount of time from DS1 to DS2 felt right since time eroded the ancient civilizations that existed in DS1. The only things that really survived were the lord souls, which makes sense since they are linked to the first flame and allow you to usher in a new era. \n\nBut then dark souls 3 takes that idea and dashes it against the rocks by bringing back a character from an ancient civilization that should no longer exist, introducing new characters from civilizations that also shouldn't exist, and having Anor London survive partly unscathed by time. It really cheapened the blow of everything that happened in DS2 and it feels fanservicey to me. ",

It couldn\u2019t become its own game like ds2 but at the same time it wasn\u2019t even real fan service. Anor Londo was only a fraction of what it was originally.

Easy. \n\nThe git gud mantra is dumb but it's true. Other than that though, equip the strongest armour you can that lets you fast roll, keep your weapon upgraded, know when you need to use a different weapon such as striking weapons against skeletons.",

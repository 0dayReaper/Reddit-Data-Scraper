There are so many ways to mitigate it though. Dont drop items on death in a manor that the killer can loot them. Only give them access to SOME of your items. make it so they become flagged in a way where if they die going forward for X amount of time they get a higher penalty than just losing their stuff. bla bla bla. But they seemingly want it to be a cut throat game.\n\nALSO and most importantly. People need to grow the fuck up and understand themselves. If you dont want to be killed on sight then join a fuckin RP / friendly server. Stop joining servers just because they wiped an hour ago and there are none that suit your tastes on the current refresh page. \n\nfacepunch needs to also make the server search feature MUCH more detailed.",

You will be 100% immersed and hours will melt away like you've never known.\n\nYou can't gauge it by looking at videos. It's when you *play* it, the game just shines. Shines beyond anything else. And the game is the most *fun* I've had playing solo in YEARS.\n\nI'm a slow gamer too. And the game compliments our play style perfectly. I have 40 hours in 4 days. I can't. Get. Enough.\n\nI'm literally taking a lay down break to save my back from these 6-8 hour journeys.\n\nI'd marry this fucking game if I could.",

Its not a hard game once you build a couple items (e.g. bow, armor, and food), but you can still die if you aren't paying attention. The way the enemies swarm and chase you makes the combat pretty dynamic and recovering your items if you die at night in the forest can be spooky and nerve wracking.",

Once you create a tool to build, chop wood, pick stone etc. You never worry about it being destroyed. You can always repair it fully with minimal resources. Having to eat has just enough difficulty to keep it necessary. Building at first seems buggy but it is simple and addicting.

I think the animations make it harder to time your attacks, but easier to dodge or block enemies. In MC you just spam block with a shield and attack at a regular interval...the only challenge is getting the distances correct. If you do that in Vallheim when surrounded you will quickly run out of stamina then get beat down.",

You aren't forced to eat or sleep, but the game incentivizes you naturally want to.\n\n~~Base~~ Homebuilding is required, but gives you leeway to make it pretty while still being mechanically optimal. Adds attachment to the world without being ridiculously grindy.\n\nCombat is \"dimsouls\". Action based, punishing if you mess up, but ultimately simpler than darksouls and more beginner friendly.\n\nThe game is much closer to a sandy RPG than it is a sandbox survival. The game has a win condition and clear goals, even if it lets you decide how to approach them. There aren't that many games in this genre.",

But to me this game is \"viking minecraft with a plot\", it fills a similar niche as other builder games and open world rpgs.\n\nSome of the game mechanics are nice. For example you need to have a fire near your bed to warm up. However, the smoke particles are simulated pretty realistically and can get trapped indoors, which inflicts damage, and then you should construct a chimney or other outlet for smoke.\n\nAside from that, it may just be luck that it was picked out of the crowd!",

( more on this in a sec)\n\u25aa\ufe0e sense of exploration and a reason to go to every biome\n\u25aa\ufe0e beautiful world, sure the textures are basically pixel art slapped on a 3d model but boy does it look good sailing down a river to a new destination with the sun rising on one side and the moon setting on the other. \n\u25aa\ufe0e eating gives a buff and you'll want to do it, same for sleep, but the game isn't going to start ticking your health down if you don't so it no longer feels like a chore.  \n\u25aa\ufe0e sense of discovery as you find new items, new recipes, new dungeons, boss location etc etc.\n\nOkay progression. Areas that kick your ass early on become easier as you go through new areas and get better gear. It all feels very natural. You also have to prepare for adventures, you won't lose health for not eating but you'll want to eat good food and the game encourages you to have 3 different pieces of good food around. Going for a long journey? Bring a ton of arrows, food, the proper mead (this games potions badically) and maybe enough resources to set up a base camp. \n\ntldr: a bunch of systems that work very well together makes for a good survival game when so many in this genre are really...just....bad.",

I don't think there is a single thing I could point out and say \"wow, this part really just sets the game apart\". What it does right to me is a bunch of little things that do a good job that don't cut through the emersion of the gameplay by avoiding egregious bugs, having good (but still simple) things to fight (and protect against), the player movement feels good (which is very important to me, since janky movement ruins games [sub-parenthesis: some aspects need improvement like being in water]). Also, importantly, even though it's early access, I can see a good future for content if they introduce content how I think they might. At it's core, it's still an open world survival game, so you still need to enjoy the genre to enjoy the game.",

The games way of making you explore and discover the world is amazing\n\ngames like minecraft and maybe other games all look samey no matter where you go and you encounter the same mobs over an over. \n\nbut in valheim every biome has a specific challenge youll need to prepare for. every adventure into a biome in order to collect your specific resource is a challenge and trek. the environment is just as much as an enemy sometimes.\n\nthe combat in the game is surprisingly punishing and does need a few tweaks but at its core is actually quite in-depth. theres parry attacks, monsters have different weaknesses and no one weapon out-shines it all. you are free to approach any boss with a different strategy.\n\nin minecraft or whatver if you need ore you can probably just go out and just mine in the same spot everytime, but in this game youll probably need a cart, food, a little base to repair your tools, and maybe even a boat! or maybe some other precautions I wont spoil. imagine if every new biome was as challenging and specific as the nether.\n\ni was worried my group of FIVE would be done and efficient with this game fast but we\u2019ve been playing for like a week straight and up until ungodly hours and we\u2019re still not done.",

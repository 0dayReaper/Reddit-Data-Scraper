There are a handful of objects in this game that have their mesh somehow *inverted* which results in these objects applying an attractive force to anything contacting their exterior. And because the mesh is reversed that means once the foreign body is pulled beyond the threshold it attempts to repel the the object in the wrong direction, forcing it deeper within the \"inside\" of the structure. \n\n**TL:DR: These objects suck things in.**\n\nMost, but not all, of these objects also have their \"inside\" and \"outside\" textures inverted as well, resulting in the black void appearance you can see on the pole in my clip that is never meant to be seen since it's the interior--which is textureless.",

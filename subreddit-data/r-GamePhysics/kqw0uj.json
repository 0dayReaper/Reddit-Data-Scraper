Night city is a parkour paradise and occasionally you can call your car and it spawns on a rooftop you are on. How op got that high though i don't know. A lot of buildings you clip straight through when you get up to them.",

Two things that could have seriously changed the balance of gameplay at times not to mention any other items (though never really have i looked at a wall and said \"damn, i wish I could run on this. It would really improve my gameplay experience\"). I completely agree with these assessments from both of you. It is clearly a passion project (many games are) that was rushed to release. They jumped the gun, ate their words, and are hurting because of it. \n\nI was just watching a video of the \"A Hat in Time\" dev team watching a speedrun of their game. In it one of the devs says \"You never finish a game. You release a game.\" They point out a lot of content that changed RIGHT before the release, fundamental changes to gameplay and level design even, as well as content that was completely scrapped. It was a pretty cool video tbh.",

There are 0 consequences for your actions for the most part in this game, the AI is a joke anyway. most of the time the AI just sits in cover and does nothing but aimlessly fire at you. Going to very hard changes nothing but damage modifiers (your damage vs theirs).",

For me its the fact the game has rough edges everywhere, nothing feels fully polished or fleshed out. The prologue is a 2 minute montage, ruining the pacing and impact of the intro leaving you wondering who the characters even are and why you should care about them. The life paths having so little effect and are a 1 hour intro to the game and nothing really meaningful after that. The AI being some of the worst I've seen (police and traffic AI specifically). The world being relatively empty, these huge mega-buildings they talked about being a single floor and nothing more. Half the content in the game being shallow side gigs and the length of the game being much, much shorter than TW3. \n\n&gt; I was just watching a video of the \"A Hat in Time\" dev team watching a speedrun of their game.\n\nI'll check this out I love those videos.\n\n&gt; In it one of the devs says \"You never finish a game. You release a game.\"\n\nI fully understand this, I work in software and know how much of a rabbit hole big projects can become with intended features and bug fixes etc. There's the idea of scope, time and cost/quality where you can only ever have two of them (i.e greater scope -&gt; more time needed/more costly) and its often restraints placed upon the dev team that result in these disasters where too much was attempted with far too aggressive deadlines. \n\nSorry for the rant but it just disappoints me, I had high hopes for the game and seeing the potential it had go to waste somewhat hurts considering this is Mike Pondsmith's lifelong work at stake and a genre I love more than any other.",

I still am enjoying the game but it falls short of what I wanted out of it. Probably my biggest issue besides some of the things you listed is the driving is horrible. Like, some of the worst driving I've experienced in any game. PUBG somehow was a more enjoyable driving experience. There are a couple mods that fix the wild turning sort of but jeez is it bad. That racing was an absolute JOKE. The teleporting cars were immersion breaking at the very least. I'm driving the fastest car in the game, that hooptie behind me should be right behind mw. I would rather GTAV style unrealistic but fun cars to the crap we were given in this game. \n\nThe game overall is a pretty big disappointment. I wasn't aboard the hype train but the things that overtly were being said about the game were embellished to say the least. \n\n[here](https://youtu.be/E7jnhV2aRkg) is a link to the speedrun i referenced. It is actually one of my favorite \"devs react\" on IGN. I love the three of them. They were excited to talk about their game and their community.

Genuinely curious - I saw the trailers and can't remember anything major that isn't in the game. \n\nI also think the GTA comparisons involve a rose-tinted glasses effect, GTA Vice City was much smaller in scale. And, this is a preference thing, a lot of the details in GTA's open worlds are just meh. I do all the little activities or minigames/whatever once, say \"that's cool\", and then never do them again - not missing their presence. The NPC AI and driving is lightyears better in GTA though, which isn't surprising since it's Rockstar's bread and butter. Hopefully CDPR can improve on that front.

I really can't understate how much the time is spent watching NPCs talk and personally I haven't found the story engages deeply enough with its themes to justify it - but taste differs. The characters are fairly interesting but are slow to develop, or maybe it just seems that way because you're constantly hopping from one to the other. \n\nThe combat, that other 20% also feels only halfway done. \n\nLike - guns look and sound great but enemies are kinda spongy on hard. I rely on high damage, low fire rate weapons because otherwise it feels like you have no impact. You can also jump and snipe accurately, but I can't dash left/right and fire accurately - despite perks specifically enabling dash firing with handguns &amp; the kereznikov mod seemingly explicitly designed for this - because for some reason player momentum changes the trajectory of a bullet and causes it to veer off into nowhere, [here's a pic I took to show this](https://imgur.com/TkJQxO6). It's not even a small difference, this is at close range and it dramatically veers off a foot to the left. A high reflex build relying on dodge chance doesn't feel good because it feels random when enemies hit you, and enemies always hit like a truck for some reason. Armor doesn't seem to accomplish anything meaningful which made my focus into technical ability feel pointless. I die *a lot* and my preferred way to play, running and gunning, ducking &amp; weaving, is far more punishable than just sniping by pop-shooting from cover and that isn't half as fun. I keep trying to make it work but enemies appear to use hitscan weapons and will kill you in less than a second flat when exposed, making all the fun movement options feel pointless. \n\nThe whole combat system feels like it *should* feel good, but it doesn't. It's a *lot* better than TW3's, but it still feels half-baked. Like the pieces are there but it needs more refinement to click.",

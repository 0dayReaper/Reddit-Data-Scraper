If you're doing any kind of engineering that uses CAD software, then you can justify the GPU too. Most people I know at least bought themselves a netbook or something with their student loans. I mean, they're loans, it's your prerogative to decide whatever you want to use them for as long as you pay them back.",

Experiencing a high energy collision usually means you're out of the race. The result wouldn't change even if there were realistic high energy collision physics involved.\n\nRealistic high energy collision physics would require realistic damage physics. The cars and trackside objects would have to disintegrate and deform as result of collisions to absorb some of the energy realistically. Those damage physics should work together with the driving model so that a deformed or broken car would perform like expected. Besides that, all cars should have a detailed enough structural model for the damage physics to work with.\n\nI think it's possible to develop a game that has it all, but it would just take a lot of work. It's probably not economically feasible yet. In future it could be, with better tools, libraries, physics models and hardware, if there's enough demand for such game even then.",

                    "comment": "It's not about parts flying off, moreso about crumpling physics. \n\nParts flying off is mainly cosmetic, the weirdness here occurred because when the car hit the barrier, the energy should've gone into smooshing the bonnet. Instead the car went slightly inside the barrier (one frame it was outside, the next inside, at no point did it contact the outside of the barrier the way you'd expect in reality) and in many games the physics will place the car back outside the barrier and add a force to it (often calculated by how far inside the barrier it got within that one frame). If you hit a weirdly shaped barrier, or if you're in the air/at a weird angle then this force calculation goes horribly wrong.  \n\nYou can actually see this on the catch fences at nascar circuits in Iracing too. They have a very small inward force, so the car will hit them and get caught in it like a spider's web.  \n\nThe reason behind that is so that collisions between cars can be handled quickly and easily, the coefficient of the force is made so that contact is realistic and not too bouncy or too soft.  \n\nThis kind of glitch can happen in almost any game with physical objects, how it is handled depends on the physics engine used. But you see it in Skyrim, CSGO, Battlefield, Witcher... you name it. ",

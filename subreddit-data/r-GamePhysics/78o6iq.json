Corruption in football is well known, it makes sense that EA would code into their game a way for players to be secretly letting goals in to allow gambling side-characters to make money. Maybe it's an alternative way to progress in career mode? ",

In 3 games was quickly reminded that the frustration exceeds the joy of that game. \n\nHit woodwork on 2 free kicks then a wide open tap in. They tied the game at the end 1-1 when my defender decided the opportune time to cramp up is when chasing a ball hit over the top in the 89th minute. So even though I outshot the other team 21 to 3, I get a draw and the opposing keeper gets a 9.7 rating with 14 saves from a 1 in a million performance. Yet this is typical of every game. ",

NHL you can outshoot the CPU 70-10 and the score of the game will be 6-5 you, with their goalie making insane saves, and yours completely derping.\n\nMadden you could get turnovers every time on defense, and a touchdown every other drive, but you'd still only end up winning by maybe 2 possessions because all the kicks get returned for touchdowns or field goals.",

There would be times in FIFA where I would watch replays and the ball actually clipped through my player\u2019s foot when I went for a challenge. So infuriating to play great defense and ball possession for ~13 minutes just to lose because the opponent had a player with a good finishing rating or something like that. \n\n\nAlso, I play Battlefield too!

Cycling, Forecheck. I mean nobody asked for 3v3 arcade mode. I assume the sale EA has for $40 is an indicator of the junk they keep putting out. They are probably going to reason that hockey doesn't sell. I hope they stop making games so somebody else can try",

If it takes you 30 shots to get 3 goals, the AI probably needs 10\n\n- if the AI has possession, deflected shots always curiously deflect FAR away from your defenders to increase AI zone time\n\n- During board play your teammates will either a) wait 30 feet away where they can't help you or b) move to the side of you where you can't kick the puck without the opposing team getting it. They will NEVER move to the side where you can easily kick it to them\n\n- If you try and pass to a player, your pass is probably gonna go to the guy 20 degrees and 50 feet away from the guy you were aiming for.\n\n- the AI can brush you and knock you down but if you try and hit them at anything slower than full speed, your player tends to suspiciously curve around their hitbox.\n\nAlso, they 'overhauled' the rating system but I'm 95% sure they just took their old rating and knocked everyone down 3 points to make it Look different. For example Crosby is 93 overall. Last year he was around 96.\n\n",

Most of the time it is no goal. But not always. A striker aims where the defender isn't, for one thing. In FIFA, if your defender is correctly positioned, this usually results in either a block or a shot that goes wide. But very occasionally the defender won't block it and it'll be a shot on target. Even more occasionally, that'll be a goal. This happens in real life too.\n\nEDIT: [Example(s)](https://youtu.be/Rz5Gm-iOZiQ?t=82)",

Usually that's how a successful low-percentage-shot roll appears in-game, where it's *just* out of reach of the goalie. Something must have happened that broke that \"near miss\" sequence of animations, and the game had to come up with a physically-possible goal on the fly.\n\nI imagine it's probably to prevent tricking the engine by bumping the goalie a little bit (which is a foul in real soccer but could be difficult for the game to call accurately).

My receiver had Slay burnt, the ball was literally about to fall neatly in his hands before Madden struck. Suddenly the ball takes a sharp curve and turns right into the well behind Slay's hands. I mean egregiously too, its a severe curve.\n\nLuckily I was up by two scores late, or I would have rage quit immediately.",

It has every feature that took 5 ish years for fifa to catch up on: \n\nPower bar \n\nl1+triangle to make an lob pass\n\ndouble or triple tap for crosses to either go fast mid height or fast near the ground\n\nl1 plus shoot to do a lob shot over the keeper\n\nfreekicks are more or less how they are now in fifa\n\nThis game was released in 2001 and fifa was sooo far behind gameplay wise. Fifa 2001-02-03-04 were just lightyears behind pes. I feel like fifa are just lazy because of the monopoly when it comes to licensing. I have decided to not support their uninspiring development because of it. ",

Instead we got a choice of whether or not Thierry Henry becomes our friend and then whether or not we stick with our agent or not.  These are NOT the \"meaningful decisions\" i was hoping for. /rant over)\n\nIt's the only reason i'm buying and playing FIFA now but I feel like it could be done wayyyy better...and for fucks sake, put some of the mechanics of Journey into the player campaign mode!!!",

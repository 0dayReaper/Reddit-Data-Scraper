Clearly this would get rid of the \u2018falling\u2019 aspect but is there anything else I can do with the pixel by pixel simulation?\n\nI came up with Forest Fire, a game where the goal is to spread as much flames as possible. Each element in the forest has its own physical properties (wood burns slow, oil burns fast, water extinguishes etc). I combined that with some bullet hell style cloud dodging and came up with a simple yet hypnotic game where you run amuck causing chaos.\n\nMy spouse and I have been working on [Forest Fire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2242220/Forest_Fire/) for over a year, and we just left Early Access. Cheers :)",

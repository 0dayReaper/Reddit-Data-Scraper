Even though I've dismembered it and it's physically impossible that it should even be able to move!?\" would be the point of horror, not just that it's undead. I'm kinda tired of jumpscare, and \"creepy disappearing ghost\" style games that have been in vogue of late. I need something different, some of that \"Horror that should not- No, it *cannot* be!\" type stuff.",

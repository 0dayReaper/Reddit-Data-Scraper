Don't like Steam?\n\nI dread buying any game off Windows Store as it just feels so weird and I've had issues with it in the past. Plus being able to see when things update on Steam is nice.\n\nIt really sucks actually as I don't like monopolies but I also would rather just have Steam be the main PC platform which makes no sense. Of course the only thing something like Origin has over Steam is real customer service. ",

I\u2019m playing through the Batman Telltale game at the moment. \n\nThere\u2019s no mechanical skill involved, because it isn\u2019t hat type of game. It\u2019s a linear storytelling game, much like Life is Strange (which I also love). If you\u2019re not a fan of the genre (not you specifically, but gamers in general), you\u2019ll most likely dislike the Telltale games. ",

So many Batman stories push forth the idea that Bruce Wayne is Batman's mask, and that Bruce only ever comes out to maintain his civilian persona. And I'm not ragging on the traditional Batman tales here; it's a totally fine way to handle the character. But Telltale decided to be a bit bolder with their interpretation by letting the player chose which identity would truly define them. Would they use the power and influence of Bruce, or the skill and tech of Batman? \n\nIt's a really fresh take that, along with the aforementioned intrigue revolving around the Wayne lineage, invigorates your love for a character and the different stories you can tell with them.",

Made a little game called Firewatch! \n\nYou can tell the writing quality went with them. Some don't like the firewatch ending, but you can't deny the dialogue and character development was amazing.\n\nI'd say they do dialogue better than anyone in the gaming world. It's so natural and compelling. They also do humor well. So many games try to be funny here and there, and it usually feels forced.\n\nReally excited to see what they do next!",

                    "comment": "Everyone is loosely correct, like the hairpiece is.\n\nWhen you make a character in a game (2d or 3d), you give them what is called an armature. It's effectively a skeleton, and is made up of bones. These bones bend only at the joints and are restricted to certain ranges of motion like real joints. Armatures also have additional bones and control points for things like hair, clothing, or whatever else is relevant.\n\nWhen you take the model of a character and give it an armature, you have to define which bones control which parts of the body. For example, the neck bone will bend the model from the shoulders up, but a separate head bone will move the head from the neck up. But, when you bend your head forward, your neck also changes shape regardless of if you've bent your neck.\n\nThat introduces the idea of weighted bones, meaning that each bone not only has an area it controls, but for every point within that area, the amount of control it has is adjustable.\n\nI'm fairly confident that what we're seeing is that the hair has been attached to the wrong bone on the armature and that whatever bone that is controls it with 5x the power that it should. I say this because it doesn't necessarily move with Alfred's head like it should, and when it does move it's moving much more than anything else.\n\nAnother possibility is that it is being controlled by both the neck bones and the head bones, meaning that it moves with the sum of the movement of all those bones.\n\nAnyway, it's probably a very quick fix and it obviously should have been caught in QA. I'm glad it didn't because this glitch is hilarious.",

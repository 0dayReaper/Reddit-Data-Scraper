It wouldn't be a lot of work to do it officially. It's just, well, not how they wanted to do the coop campaign, and chose the Halo CE/2 route instead.\n\nAnd if I'm being honest I'd rather have that than two samurais, a Noble 6, and a Spartan with cat ears fighting the Banished if we're talking about immersion.",

They wrote themselves into that position. What's more lore-friendly? Chief and three other Spartans taking back a Halo ring, or Chief splitting into four independent bodies between cutscenes? \n\n&gt;And let's be honest, swapping Master Chief for a custom Spartan is totally doable, modders did it right after the game came out, it seems it's possible in-game, and very simple.\n\nThat's exactly my point. And yet, they did not. Because they're lazy.\n\n&gt;It's just, well, not how they wanted to do the coop campaign, and chose the Halo CE/2 route instead.\n\nThose campaigns were made before Halo multiplayer was even a thing, and customisation was literally just colours. Times have changed. We had the Arbiter. We had Reach. Hell, they even put the effort in with Halo 5 and did it then. \n\n&gt;And if I'm being honest I'd rather have that than two samurais, a Noble 6, and a Spartan with cat ears fighting the Banished if we're talking about immersion.\n\nThey can ditch the neon bullshit, but besides that, those armour pieces are lore-friendly and also mass produced in universe. To say that seeing another person wear the same uniform as 6 is immersion breaking completely ignores the fact that it's a uniform.",

Also its rumored that Johnny Carmack threatened to quit unless they went back to Doom... so there's that.\n\nEDIT: Spelling and clarity",

The game may have failed to load the boundary completely, and when they walk into a space that failed to load, it defaults as out of bounds and kills them.\n\nThe reason they fly off to their left is because it would look ridiculous if they died without any force applied. If they died without force, they would just ragdoll onto the ground and it would be extremely obvious nothing actually killed them. So they get a mild amount of force in a default direction to make it look less weird.",

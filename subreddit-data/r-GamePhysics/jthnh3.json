Now a days companies might make an Easter egg but a whole hidden feature like cheat codes is unheard of. And the benefits cheat codes allowed (infinite money and hp for example) are usually distilled into like a sandbox mode or some optional \u201ccheat\u201d menu to enable a sandbox like environment. \n\nIdk where I\u2019m going with this but I\u2019m gonna post anyways have a good day",

As a kid I had to use my chin on the N64 controller to do it.\n\n\"Start a new game on Medium difficulty. Call it .Wampa..Stompa (Case sensitive). Start in a level and as soon as it starts press pause. Now press and hold all at once C up, C right, C down, C left, L, R, Z and Left on the d-pad. While holding these down gently move the control stick left halfway, and hold all this until you hear a sound. Do the same thing with the joystick facing right, then left, right and finally left. Make sure you keep the other buttons held down during this time.\nIf it worked pink writing will come up, and using L, R and A you can select cheats such as 50 lives, wall ghost, next level, gravity, jump power etc. To make the menu reappear each time you go back to the pause screen C up, C right, C down, C left, L, R, Z and Left on the d-pad.\"",

You're kidding yourself if you think devs weren't trying to one-up each other graphically back then, for starters. Or that 70-80% of titles weren't anything from bargain bin schlock to mediocre. Or that game devs don't care about making their games fun now (which is more than a little insulting to modern game devs).\n\nI have a bin full of shovelware SNES and PS2 games (with some legit hits) that I accrued throughout my childhood from relatives that didn't want them anymore.

For successful games of that era, the visuals are bright, evenly lit, and distinct - not only are the controls well-designed but you can clearly see what you are doing, The animations are simpler and quicker and provide immediate obvious feedback, making it easier to understand the results of your inputs. Environments tended to be stylized but non-complex, with much less visual and spatial clutter. Levels were almost completely handmade with minimal procedural generation. \n\nBasically, the whole experience is well-crafted and very tight, with little excess fat. Compare to modern games which have much more realistic lighting and shadows, far larger levels, and more accurate physics - they can still be fun, but the don't have that bouncy-ball-like punch of their earlier counterparts.",

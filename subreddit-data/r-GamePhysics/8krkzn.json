In a lot of animal threads he'd show up with a \"biologist here\" comment and drop some knowledge in an entertaining way. He got pretty reddit famous and i think he even did a TED talk on his research but i might be making that up. Then one day he got in a bit of a nasty argument with another user who was saying jackdaws were crows or something. And then shortly after that the admins found out he was manipulating votes by using multiple accounts to downvote the person he was arguing with and upvote his own comments. This got his account banned from reddit and he got a lot of shit for it. People making all sorts of memes and jokes about it like the user i responded to.",

If that's true it just takes something spawning late in a position which overlaps other objects to make this happen. \n\nProbably a debug function which they forgot to take out (or left in during crunch time).\n\nEither that or just a generic physics-bug \"prevention\" function where if two objects overlap it does the same thing.\n\nE: changed Z axis to vertical - there's no consistency across game engines which axis is used for \"up/down\", and AC uses its own engine.",

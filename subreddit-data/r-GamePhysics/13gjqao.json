We'd use it to fly around the maps at lightning speed, nicknamed it \u201cSpidermanning\u201d around. The mechanic was totally broken, no range limitations, no height limitations, completely disconnected from physics, and it always zipped you to your destination in under a second.\n\nIt basically made you invincible, but we figured out that you weren't invulnerable to proxy bombs, which we would just litter the map with. After that it was just a game of Russian Roulette to see who would trip which player's bombs and when.",

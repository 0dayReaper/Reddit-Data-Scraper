(The game keeps playing in perfect framerate, I just have  no in-game controls, can't even press escape, just alt-tab to close the game from the task manager) \n\nSupposedly it's because I use a pair of Astros which have a DAC and that breaks the game somehow. (Which is the most idiotic bug I've ever heard of, how the fuck does that even happen?)",

Again, it doesn't change the fact the game becomes literally unplayable for me at random intervals.\n\nI shouldn't have to play an fps without fucking audio just to make it work.",

BF4 was special cause it was big and that space allowed players to mess around with different weapons and strategies. The variation in \"action level\" in different parts of the map allowed for experimentation. \n\nThe new one just feels more like any other run and gun shooter in regards to its pasing. Which is fine but doesn't fit the battlefield line IMO. That classic battlefield feel was dead since hardline though so it's not like this game specifically killed it.",

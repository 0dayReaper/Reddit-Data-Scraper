You can grind away at tricks and feel some sense of accomplishment. The visuals are pretty far ahead of most skating games, but the animations break the realism sometimes. There's a loose structure to the storyline but you can kinda ignore it if you just wanna skate. You can customize your deck, wheels, trucks, skater, etc. And move objects around similar to Skate 3. There's a ton of iconic skate spots from Philly, NYC, and San Fran too, a lot of attention to detail. \n\n\nBads: it still feels like a beta, even after their \"Official release\" last year. Animations are buggy, a lot of tricks are still under \"experimental\" like primos, caspers, and late flips. There's almost zero vert physics, no grabs or foot plants, and transition physics are still really hard to control, so it feels like a street skating sim more than anything at this point. The world you skate in is also kinda dead, they just started adding moving AI pedestrians but everything else is mostly stationary.",

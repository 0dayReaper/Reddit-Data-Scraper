That's on the *final* release patch which came out over a year after, with no patches since to correct any of these issues (due to them all working on CP2077 no doubt).\n\nThe games CDPR have put out have all been hot messes, but not enough people knew about it since they only really paid attention to Witcher 3 which was easily the most polished of them. I wasn't expecting it to be as bad, but people acting like a bug-free game was possible from this company are clearly unfamiliar with them, especially considering how different this is and larger in scope from their previous projects.",

The Witcher is a third person fantasy RPG with an established world and characters, and two previous games to learn from. \n\nCP is a first person future RPG with guns, cars, that is based on a tabletop RPG that has plenty of established characters and story but ultimately works as a framework for people to base their own characters and stories on. It has guns, cars, and a gigantic city with outskirts to design. People might shit on the fact you can\u2019t enter the vast majority of buildings but it\u2019s still pretty huge considering how vertical most of the buildings go, and honestly how diverse a lot of them are in silhouette (besides the \u201cmega building\u201d apartment complexes which are the same by design). It was way, way, way too much to try to build from scratch given their resources and it shows. They also were spending too much time developing trailers and demos to show off possible features instead of just making those features. \n\nNot to mention trying to add support for 7 year old consoles was a nightmare given their obsession with cutting edge graphics. Witcher 3 maxes out my 3090 at 1440p 144fps at all highest settings. That game is almost 5 years old now. There was no chance in hell this game would look as good as they wanted it to for those consoles, but they tried to make it work without enough time to even finish the game on its primary platform. \n\nCP2077 was a disappointment on PC but an actual crime on consoles. I hope that they can recover from this and turn it around but I also hope people actually fucking learn this time, because No Man\u2019s Sky getting better over time made everyone supposedly forget just how badly a hyped game can launch at.",

It brought a ton of new eyes and players to their game who didn't know the company's track record. I'm not forgiving them at all, by the way, I'm just saying people familiar with their previous games on release likely expected this, especially with all the circumstances surrounding it like COVID and a remote dev team.",

Using this example: Sure, swimming on land might be a bug that can be fixed, not having water and proper vehicle physics is not something you add in a patch though. Either CDPR acknowledges they fucked up bad and promise a proper game in 2 years more development time (which won\u2019t happen) or small bugs like swimming on land are fixed but the core stays the way it is, unfinished and comparable to games from the last decade (which is so far from the advertised game that it should be considered false advertising).",

When it ran well, I had fun, and I played about 20 hours until I couldn't take it any longer the fucked up state of the game. I put extreme importance to the graphical aspect of a game, so seeing this PS2 look alike game was huge downer, but if you plan on playing it on PC, I recommend it. I know I'm gonna have a lot of fun once it's patched up, because I already had fun in a bad state. If you have console, then forget it, wait a year at least.\n\nThat being said, it's not the game they sold us, not even on PC. The city is gorgeous but it's still dead, and not many activities. That attention to detail they portrayed before the launch of the game, is not there.",

Against goons who shoot you on sight or proximity and cannot be spoken to because this is an RPG.  Once you're done playing a mediocre cover shooter with them using a few of your x70 health kits while you hammer a single goon with 20 headshot bullets to get a kill, you can hack their laptop by playing the same number-matching minigame over and over until you win and get some money.  Enough money, and you can go to the dinky corner store and talk to the cashier who will replace your spine instantaneously because this is an RPG about a world setting where one of the primary themes is the callous use and misuse of transhumanism, so obviously all your metal parts should be treated like buying a candy bar.\n\n(That last bit is in an ironic way *extremely* cyberpunk, perhaps not intentionally.)\n\nI've been delighted to watch videos of gameplay so far.  The game is an utter train wreck and it never stops disappointing.  I am glad I didn't fall for the marketing enough to buy it, not that I don't wish it had actually been good, but it truly is so bad it's good in the end.",

There's nothing to do but a few side quests and collector things. There's no gambling or mini-games, no random conversations you can have with NPCs (just story relates ones), theres no reputation, there are no recreational brain dances,  it just feels so unfinished. \n\nI have no idea how they'd fix all that, the bugs/glitches, *and* the driving and ai and still have any time for devoloping multiplayer, plus DLCs.",

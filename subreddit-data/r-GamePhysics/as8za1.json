The bike is programmed to exert a down force to prevent losing traction on roads because of the limitations of the physics engine, but because of loops in GTA Online they just removed the effect when the angle of the bike stays stationary that way you don't lose traction in the races with loops and wall rides. Wiggling it back and forth changes the angle of the bike, leaving the bug in place.",

That plane doesn't exist for player use.\n\nEdit:\n&gt;It\u2019s achieved by going upside down and wiggling the tires and bike the way you see him doing it.\n\nAlso that is wrong. All you do is pull back. The wiggling is because it's a very small area where you have to keep it to achieve that momentum and the bike keeps wanting to upright itself which will turn the bike in the direction it's facing, hence the need to correct it and wiggling look. \n\nBut all you have to do is pull the stick back to the right spot. If you somehow had the nanometre accuracy required there would be no wiggle.",

Essentially, the developers added artificial downforce to motorcycle physics to keep them from sliding out of turns and if you manipulate the bike the right way you can get this force to apply upside down. I suspect this is why motorcycles refuse to stay upside down while in the air, if they did it would be far too easy to exploit the downforce.",

USSR has a lot of bias so their vehicles are the best in game, Swedish and Italian vehicles I found to be the most fun to use and the Swedish tech tree is a very good one too. The german tech tree is very good most of the time with a few exceptions. The American tech tree is probably the most balanced out of the popular nations. I don\u2019t have much playtime with France so I can\u2019t really speak for them, the British tech tree has a few gems in it and at battlerating 4.7 ground it is incredibly powerful. Japans early world war 2 tech tree is very good as well as their world war 2 SPG\u2019s, however from cold war onwards it\u2019s very painful. As for Israel I don\u2019t have much experience with their aircraft as I never grinded past the first aircraft which was awful, and most of their ground tech tree is just copy and paste and is overall pretty average.\n\nOh and no one plays navy",

That's on top of crew switching, repair time, reload time, etc. And on top of that, one must pay to get gold crew or play the same vehicles for ages. While one with a p2w vehicle, and or one with the best crew skills could die to a rank 1 tank, if they have a brain in their head, they easily have far more advantages than most players they face.\n\nWhile WOT has more p2w vehicles, they also probably have more premium vehicles over in its life time\n\nAs for stock grind, it's certainly better in WT but that ends in rank 3 and it starts to become painful at rank 4 as it gets worse and worse with each subsequent rank",

Even so much as experting vehicles will do that.\n\nGF RB greatly benefits from having more than 5 slots, it's a massive advantage  in helping the team win. You not only get more choice in what suits the map, and situation  but also like I said, it helps in it being a war of attrition\n\nCrew skills are vital in WT. A zero  which is a plane known for turning can not turn without its  2 maxed out crew skills. With Vitality for tankers, it's essentially p2w with the difference of it not being there, I don't think you understand how much of a difference it makes. And while there is no 6th sense, there is a skill that gives arrows on the side of the screen of where the enemies are, and even in realistic battles will have enemies pop up if you're looking at them as if it's WOT. There's a youtuber called Zenturion that played around with the distances to see when they pop up otherwise it's as if they're not there at certain distances.\n\nThere's no point in saying with WOT has X which is bad and WOT doesn't. The same could be said about WT.\n\nI haven't stopped playing WT, I've ground 95% of all ground vehicles (except didnt touch israel and china b/c copy paste)  while getting nearly all of the US tree and almost the entire JPN tree while getting half in the rest. Now I'm just playing ships and boats.\n\nI have no issue in saying WOT is predatory and awful in many ways, but it's certainly wrong to say WT is better. As Nicholas Moran said, just pick your poison.",

I\u2019ve played both games and trust me, WOT is 20x worse at least than WT. crews in WT are nowhere NEAR as important as WOT and you quite literally cannot play WOT without premium time. You also have way more \u2018booster\u2019 consumables that are necessary to play and camos that actually give stat increases during battle. There are also SO many more prem vehicles.",

What people experience in WT really changes the more they play to notice the issues and the further down the ranks they go. By the time you get to the last rank, it's glaringly obvious, and that's if you get there. You won't without premium time or putting in a shit ton of hours",

I fully support your decision and even encourage you to stay away from them. I can't speak for WOT but on top of everything I wrote, WT's community is also very toxic and nationalistic. It's no coincidence that WT has shown up in the news 7 times now? for leaking literal classified military vehicle data. Not to mention WT is extremely buggy and fixes bugs very slowly.\n\nSo by all means, do yourself a favor, stay away from both of them",

A single det pack knocks out the strongest of the tanks, and on top of it you have other tanks, planes and very limited visibility unless you wanna risk your commander being shot like an idiot by peeking out the commander hatch. And it runs on the same engine as WT.",

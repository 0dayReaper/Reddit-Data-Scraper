The gunplay just looks awkward here.\nThe weird recoil I've seen in other vids just looks weird as well.\n\nEdit:Anytime anyone says anything criticizing this game it's met with a slee of downvotes. Get off the hype train for a minute and do an actual comparison of the two games, the graphics may be better but it's missing a ton of little things that added to the style and legacy of 4. Those little things all ad up to make this a less interesting game.",

It's an iconic part of the game and they replaced it with a generic crosshair? It looks worse, the laser was a good Way to add a crosshair in a realistic way.\n\nI'm also puzzled why they didn't really put any effort into recreating the inventory screen and just made it  generic tabs",

Why settle for a game that does away with the popular stylistic choices that helped with the originals popularity?\nGo watch some comparisons of the cutscenes between the two as well, new ones are lacking details that the original has in quite a few of them",

Obviously they're going to have people complaining when it's one of many peoples favorite games of all time. And that inventory screen is just bland and boring, they put the minimum amount of effort into it. It's also weird that they don't really show any of the transformations that were shown in the original, like Mendez and most of Krausers. But the laser was a signature part of the game, there's no reason they shouldn't have made it default and kept no crosshair, it was a cool way to make the game more immersive.\n\nBut my main gripe is Capcom doing another remake instead of making a new game that's actually resident evil, unlike 6,7, or Village. They clearly know the Desire is there but they're afraid to take any risks so just keep rehashing old games, and even then instead of doing something that could actually use attention like Code Veronica or Dino Crisis lnstead they did the best aged game of it's era. It just feels like a cash grab to me.",

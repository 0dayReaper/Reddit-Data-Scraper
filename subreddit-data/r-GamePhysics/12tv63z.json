Weeping willows approaching someone too slowly for the viewer to notice sounds like something Junji Ito would come up with to me.  \n  \nThe wind blows the leaves four inches forward, they sway almost four inches backwards. But not quite. Slowly, they approach the man's house like a ratchet until he wakes up one morning and they're at his window.  \n  \nIt's too late to leave, now. No houses on the market. All the apartments are accounted for. No friends to couch-surf with, not after last week. He just has to hope.",

Instead of just picking up a medpack and being healed, you had to cauterize the wound, or pull shrapnel out of your hip, or pop back in a dislocated finger, or suck a bullet out of your arm.\n\nThere were TONS of these animations in Far Cry 2. Then a few less in Far Cry 3. By Far Cry 5, we're back to a simple \"wrap your arm with gauze and move on.\" It's been pretty disappointing. I'd love to see the games go back to the emergency first aid animations they used to have.",

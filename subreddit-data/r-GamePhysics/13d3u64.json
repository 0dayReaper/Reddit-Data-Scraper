If I wasn't a big DC fan that would've probably made me stopped playing but I keep on it and am glad I did, both for the more expanded gameplay and all the character interactions.\n\nAlso also, I recommend trying all the characters or at least going reading up their skills trees to see which gameplay style appeals to you the most. I personally try to chose who I'm playing based on what the mission demands, and I've seen a lot of people finishing the game with just one character but I prefer the variety I get from constantly changing up the gameplay styles.",

What is curious is the article opens with a wholly unrelated anti-Trump thing when the sack of shit wasn't even part of it. Also shows how even outside news sources, that is to say non domestic to the US, get things just as wrong and are as likely to be biased. \n\nThey then flip flop, stating it is a global accusation. \n\nThis is a typical bait and switch attempt to not only inserts bias of the author but to distract the audience and influence their opinion. This is Composition 101 stuff. \n\nI still remember being taught in school about conspiracy theories. In particular the illegal experiments that the US and Canada made on their populaces.\n\nSome years later was unhushed and boom, it actually happened.\n\nMaybe if governments weren't so shitty in general it wouldn't add credence to such claims. \ud83e\udd37",

When it comes to ranked play perhaps keep them segregated or else it's tough to find a happy middle ground. For casual just do what ya can and call it a day. \n\nConsoles are just so much easier/cheaper to maintain and comfortable to game on the couch, PC is more flexible/powerful/precise, they both have their place",

But it should not be so powerful that it can do 50% (or more sometimes) of the aiming part for you and even through walls, especially not in competitive games. This is what you at one point could achieve in Fortnite, although you have to spam zoom/scope and/or have just ever so slight stick drift on your right stick for this to work. This may still work though. There was a point in time where you could even abuse \"camera reset\" and it was even stronger. In Fortnite controller players also have noticeably less recoil and bloom (randomness on where your bullets end up going).\n\nBasically, so long as it's not legit overpowered like in the case mentioned above, I'm totally fine with aim assist.",

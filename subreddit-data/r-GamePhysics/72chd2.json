However it's on an outdated engine and missing some of the chapters in Surface Tension, but that can be fixed by installing the Surface Tension Uncut mod. Anyway you can see Barney's reaction firsthand. :) It might not be much different than this clip though.",

With Xen they're also going way beyond just a standard remake, since they're fleshing out the levels to be many times larger than the originals ([example](http://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/8672783/33c2f236eabd91a4582509a0cac7922ea121c4d5.png)).\n\nWorth pointing out that it sounds like they haven't done a great job in terms of being on time in the past, so it wouldn't shock me if the Xen release was postponed or something.",

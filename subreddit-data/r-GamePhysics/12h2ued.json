That\u2019s a cool 2+ year old bug they haven\u2019t fixed. Ended up having to reload a 2-hour old auto save because receiving a phone call from anyone before the mission causes him to blink out of existence. \n\nWhen I emailed CDPR, it took them 3 weeks to reply with a \u201cthis still happenin?\u201d They don\u2019t even have an automated system for creating ticket numbers, thought they didn\u2019t receive my bug report this whole time. \n\nAlso never saw anything like this in RDR2 and it was fully working on launch, so it\u2019s pretty weird to compare them.",

As for my experience in PC, I've only had about a few funny glitches the last time I played and that's about it.\n\nI've never had the game crash. Maybe 1 time, but it wasn't significant, it was my own doing. Still waiting for a funny T-pose at the moment.\n\nI've seen how bad the launch was, so I waited a few months before buying it on sale, giving CDPR time to fix stuff. Also played with controller a decent bit and didn't have the vibration glitch as of yet.\n\nOne bug I had was a door being locked for me after I've reloaded from a save, which should automatically trigger open, which for some reason didn't work in CDPR's computer. Also, my car being invulnerable and having ugly cosmetic damage after finding it inside the cave.\n\nLatter bug is fixed, they've made a patch note on that. Former likely is fixed as well. They've fixed a lot of the game from launch on PC. \n\nIdk man, it do be like that sometimes. Also, console to PC ports are often glitchy as fuck and unoptimized. But am happy you're still sticking with it till the end of the game. Do note they're still gonna be releasing a DLC and updating the game a bit more, and am running out of glitches to encounter, same could be said about consoles.",

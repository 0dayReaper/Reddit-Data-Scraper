I just don't get the appeal , like this looks horrible idk if it's the 2022 game but i know that game sold +20 million copies !! Like how tf??

I think the quality has been sus for a while now, but it's getting to the point where even the diehard fans are becoming disillusioned.\n\nIt's perhaps a lot of people's introduction to turn-based RPGs as well.",

I didn't get this one due to the bugs and lack of content in parts, but it feels like this was a test and I'll likely get the next one like this as I expect it to be much more polished.",

This one also heavily deviates from the standard formula so there are lots of things missing for sure but it's part of the reason it stands out.",

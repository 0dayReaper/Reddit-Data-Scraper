Instead, they probably use a combination of baked animations, plus some procedural generation to account for size differences &amp; make sure that the characters are grabbing each other in a mostly realistic way. (that's what you're seeing when andre is crouching on top of the glitched ring, his animations are saying \"walk\" but his feet are saying \"the ground is here\", so he ends up crouch-walking)   \n\n\nThree, We're used to seeing animations that have been hand tweaked and exaggerated by an animator enough to be very pleasing to the eye, and I wouldn't be surprised if a game like this just uses straight up mocap for the baked animations &amp; very little hand editing.",

And I mean that in a genre sense because old wrestling games were arcade-y. Nowadays, the WWE games are a mixture of simulation, utilizing stamina bars and chain wrestling stuff, *and* arcade elements with health/momentum buffs and quick move commands. Some like it, some hate it, but it's definitely something to try out if you haven't touched a wrestling game in a long time.\n\nAlso, there's Universe mode where you can create/book your own show with their own rivalries and cutscenes can happen that will drive your stories forward. It gets a little repetitive after a while, but it becomes super fun once spontaneous shit happens. ",

It takes about 20-30 minutes depending on the AI difficulty to get through the whole thing. At the end of it there was just me and a friend as the last 2 wrestlers and when we were both worn down on stamina and getting close to a dramatic finish, the whole game glitched out and half the screen turned black while the other half still showed the game but it was flipped 90 degrees and looked all glitchy while this solid flatline tone sounded. We all shouted NOOOOO!!! at the same time and it was probably the closest we had ever come to actually dying of laughter.",

What games do instead is render them with higher detail and sometimes at higher resolutions than the normal game, because they do not have to calculate things like physics and AI anymore (which are stored in the replay file).\n\nMuddying the waters a little are photo modes, which some racing games have had since the PS2 days. Those often do perform an offline render. I remember it taking up to several seconds with Gran Turismo 4 on the PS2. The resulting images looked [far better](http://www.nsxprime.com/forum/showthread.php/35701-Gran-Turismo-4-s-Photo-Mode-(samples) than replays and gameplay.",

If I am gonna be late for a dinner, I can call or message people and tell them that.  There was a time when no one had a cell phone (all landline), so if it was last minute you couldn't contact them.  And they might not even have an answering machine or service; so they don't even know that you TRIED.\n\nThat's magic.\n\nYou know what else is magic?

I also own PSVR and GearVR.\n\nFor getting into VR, you can't really go wrong with either Oculus or Vive, and PSVR is actually a very nice option too so long as you also get the Move controllers.  (VR is about output AND input; having hands matters a lot in VR)  The new Windows \"mixed reality\" headsets may also be good options but I haven't had enough experience with them directly (Though the HoloLens uses similar tracking and it's really solid for having no external sensors).\n\nThe reason I went Oculus over Vive was simply I preferred having sticks to having touchpads.  Also I feel like the Oculus controllers are more comfortable and that gripping is more natural on them (The grip buttons on Vive aren't analogue and require quite a bit of pressure to activate.)\n\nI don't recommend HoloLens to anyone except developers because there's not enough use cases for it otherwise; and it's expensive if you aren't planning on doing anything with it.  But it is actually my favorite piece of kit so far.\n\nOne final note: As I said, Oculus and Vive are both great, but one reason you might want Vive over Oculus is wiring; the Vive lighthouses just need to be plugged into power, but all 2-4 Oculus sensors have to be wired to your computer; so your room layout may dictate what headset is less of a bother.",

It's not a dev kit technically (It's called \"development edition\") it's a final product; but they use that term to dissuade people.\n\nHaving a HoloLens right now is like having an Apple II in the late 70's.  There's very little software for it and you are expected to be making your own.  Early personal computers would all be called \"dev kits\" today because all computer users were expected to be programmers.  You basically HAD to program a computer to use it, so that's what being a \"user\" meant.\n\nSo yeah, if you expect a highly supported hardware platform with a wide range of applications, HoloLens is *not* it.  If you are a developer who wants to get ahead on tools and capabilities that will become standard in all VR and AR systems (Specifically, environment mapping and collisions systems and wireless free-range movement) then it's a very great tool for learning and experimenting.\n\nOn a personal note, it's my favorite uh... private browsing experience.  Because A: no one can see what you are seeing, and B: you can web browse without touching your fingers to anything (You just point in the air and move your finger to click) so no mess on your electronics. :D",

Again though, if you aren't a developer there's a lot of other (much cheaper) options out there that have (and will continue to have) better software support than HoloLens.",

I've heard that the Desktop browsing with VR headsets just good enough yet and there are problems with FOV and screen readability.",

Oculus has a built-in desktop viewer in beta now too but it's light on options; it does work and is very clear for me to read my desktop at 1080P.  Virtual Desktop is also really great for watching 3d movies; I prefer it to watching on a 3d projector because there's no brightness cut from the glasses; but obviously if you have friends over it's no option.\n\nSteamVR also has a desktop viewing option that works both on Vive and Oculus and is pretty good, but again, I'd probably use BigScreen or Virtual Desktop.\n\nI personally am trying to move to a full VR workflow and I am almost there.  I already do a lot of code work in VR.  But again, this is just me; there's a lot of folks out there who are much more picky about resolution and screen door effects and the like.  I was using Virtual Desktop on DK1 and so in my mind other folks don't even KNOW how bad it actually can be lol.\n\nThe biggest hurdle to using your computer comfortably in VR is input; you can use a keyboard but you have to, you know, FIND your keyboard.  That kind of thing.  Once we have full hand/finger tracking we'll start to see high-speed text input in VR on virtual keyboards, which will solve that problem, but there's other tracked keyboard solutions people are figuring out in the meantime.",

Echo Arena is like that times 10.

Just like a magic trick is no fun when you explain it. Literally any thing that could be thought of could be real given time. I\u2019m relatively certain that the simulation theory is true. Some say that since we are building virtual reality landscapes here, eventually it will become indiscernible from reality. It stands to reason that any advanced race would also create them. And in an infinite there is a extremely low chance that we exist within the 1 reality. It\u2019s far more likely that we exist in one of the likely countless simulations.  There is that quote by somebody I forget that says. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indiscernible from magic. I would also say that any sufficiently advanced simulation could one day be indiscernible from reality. \n\nEdit: I\u2019m aware that I sound like one of those iamverysmart people but I assure you It\u2019s just cuz I\u2019ve been drunk all morning.",

And you get to really appreciate how clever the trick is. Sometimes the best tricks are incredibly simple and, yet, to the uninitiated they look like you're breaking the laws of reality. It's beautiful. Technology is like that too. Also, the quote is Arthur C. Clarke--the third of Clarke's three laws. \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\" The other two are worth mentioning as well 1. \"When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, they are almost certainly right. When they state that something is impossible, they are very probably wrong.\" 2. \"The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.\"\n\nEdit: Also, just wanted to address simulation theory thing. Your conclusion that we are 'probably' in a simulation rests on the premise that there is only one initial 'primary' reality and many more simulated 'secondary' realities and probability says we are more likely to be in a secondary reality. But what if there are many, if not infinite, primary realities and only some of those primary realities have secondary simulated realities? I suspect that is a more likely scenario than one primary, countless secondary realities (though there is no evidence in either case).",

Normal driving produces high forces, just the downforce alone at top speed can be up to 2000 kg (for cars that weigh about 500 to 600 kg (empty). The front wing produces about 30% of this so it alone can easily withstand 600 kg weight on it.\n\nIn terms of breaking apart F1 cars are designed to have a strong \"tub\" around the driver, and front and rear crash structures which disintegrate so as to absorb the crash forces.\n\nWhen we see wing endplates or whole wings break off due to contact with another car, yeah that is due to the massive forces involved, as as u/Legionof1 says.",

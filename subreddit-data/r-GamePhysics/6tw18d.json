At the time we were working on Totally Accurate Battle Simulator and I was still living at home with my parents.  \nTABS was looking like it was gonna do well but it was just taking so long to finish, and there was no end in sight for the project, and I really wanted to move out.   \n  \nSo I decided that I would make a small side project game to finance me moving out and getting an apartment.  \nI was hoping that the game would sell 50K copies. That would be enough.   \nWe were joking about \"Imagine if the game just blows up and sells like a million copies. That would be insane\" on the week of release and now 4 years later the game just reached 5M copies sold. Its suuper odd that it got so big!",

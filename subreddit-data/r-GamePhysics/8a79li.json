I personally dislike GTA Online I don't have enough time to keep up with it I tried in the beginning but just don't have the time eventually everyone had way more money than I and cool shit and it became a chore to grind to get enough money to buy anything cool.",

Because there's a glitch in SP where you can't access the in-game Internet if you switch characters too many times. And it *still* hasn't been patched. If it had been in Online, they'd have patched it in a heartbeat, but since it's SP, it can go fuck itself.",

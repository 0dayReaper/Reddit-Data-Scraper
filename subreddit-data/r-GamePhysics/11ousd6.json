They fixed this, but they did so in 2021 (8 years after release, and long after most people stopped playing the game)\n\n- Online was gimmicked to high hell and suffered from additions like Oppressor MKII and Orbital Cannon\n\n- Rockstar destroyed Online by making everything prohibitively expensive and turning the game into a grind fest - on its own that wouldn't necessarily have sucked the life out of the game, but they turned free mode into a giant mission where nobody fucks around en masse like they used to, so the magic is all gone\n\n- There are many other things but I am stoned and sad because I miss GTA V a lot",

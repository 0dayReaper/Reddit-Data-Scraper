It's very subtle\n\nEdit: Managed to capture another couple examples whilst playing today. Hopefully these make it clearer that the tyre is indeed deforming and it's not clipping through the ground:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Z8UOuXO",

If you take the tyres over sharp edges or spike strips (like that video) they'll deflate.

It consists of excellent depictions of '80s Oldsmobiles and Chevrolets, with variations ranging from grandma's shopping car to a presidential limo. Absurdly detailed and varied, endlessly configurable, absolutely perfect in every regard. You don't even need to be into Malaise-era American motoring to enjoy this mod. \n\nIt's just hilarious to play with all of the intense body roll, lack of grip, going sideways at parking lot speeds, the car swaying like a boat for a few seconds after every bump.\n\nKeep in mind that this mod requires a manual installation for most of the content. You need to both subscribe and then download a file and put them into BeamNG's mods directory. \n\nhttps://www.beamng.com/resources/codename-oldsfullsize.1417/",

There are lots of challenges you can do, like checkpoint racing, taking down other vehicles, hitting things, escaping things, stunt challenges, time trials and so on. There\u2019s even a multiplayer mod out and people have modded in real tracks from Assetto Corsa. \n\nBut honestly a lot of those things do feel a bit tacked on and it doesn\u2019t have any sort of narrative really. Some people like it that way, some don\u2019t.",

Obviously, this is very system-dependant but a game like GTA where car physics aren't the name of the game is going to prioritise being lots of NPCs driving around to make the world feel cooler over the car physics",

It physically simulates every moving part of the car, including the engine. The game starts to hammer good PCs with only a few cars on screen. Back when I played it a few years ago, a few cars in BeamNG used more CPU resources as GTA V did as a whole.",

Not sure why it hasn't really done that in this instance but it'd be easy to verify with the provided debug tools or just practical testing(in fact, if you flipped the car with a nodegrabber then increased the gravitational acceleration enough you'd crush both roof and the rollcage with enough force)",

But i guess you are just an IGN senior editor, which is proof that you have absolutely no knowledge about just how hard coding is. \n\nBesides, you are also shoveling bs with this comment, in good ol' IGN fashion, because Cyberpunk is very much loved nowadays. Which is weird that you didnt know that since you made a POST ABOUT IT YOURSELF a month ago.",

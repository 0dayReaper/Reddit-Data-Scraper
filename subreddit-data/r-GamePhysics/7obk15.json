He explained a bit of his vision to be akin to the korean lol matches. But he want the whole infield to be the 100 players and people being able to watch as that first poor sap who gets killed has to stand up and walk off. \n\nAnd to me. That sounds like it would be amazing to see live. We may even end up with some great player vs spectator clips of guys getting jeered or cheered as they walk away. ",

Fortnite I've not tried and A3 BR takes a while to get going and is pretty clunky itself, and I think the maps arent as good for the game mode.  PUBG is like instant games with full people, I can squad with my friends and it sets it all up for us, and we can revive downed teammates. You don't have to deal with Arma 3 inventory, falling from 3 feet and dying, exploding your truck on a small rock etc.  I love Arma 3 but I don't like it for this looting focused game mode as much.

It is gaining in traction though. I think this all started with the DayZ mod bringing about attention to a demand for this kind of game. However, they never solidified what they were trying to do there. We eventually got H1Z1, which I know exists but I couldn't tell you anything about. At least with PUBG, it seems it got real big, real fast. Faster than they predicted or were prepared for. They have to catch up to the player base, and if/when they do, they'll make a great final product worthy of years of enjoyment...or, they'll capitalize on it, just do the minimum amount of work, and get rich anyways. I could see it go either way. They recently launched their mobile version in China. No idea how that's played out but this at least let's us know they're trying to port it. We'll just have to wait and see how it plays out. Personally, I don't have a console and I don't have a PC worthy to run games so I play Rules of Survival on my phone. Could play nicer, it's like a cross between Fortnight and PUBG, but for a mobile version of this kind of game they're doing insanely well; weekly updates, holiday events, a world tournament in the works. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in the genre.",

The company is trash, they can't create a good game for crap, their community management is terrible, marketing is poor, just overall a shitty company. The game is terribly written, gunplay is poor, lag and server issues cripple the game. \n\nBut it has a really good vibe, it's fun gameplay and the idea behind it is refreshing and fun compared to most games. Lots of players, picking up loot, largeish map, all that is pretty fun. I play a lot of it with friends. I really really reallllllly wish there was a good non-cartoon alternative. But there is nothing else in the niche that is big.  ",

He did nothing for a half hour and both his kills had back turned and of course he was all proud of himself like he achieved something lol.

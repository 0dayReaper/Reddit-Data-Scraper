I solely engage in gaming activities on the computer and I apologize that you are facing difficulties with a malfunctioning game on the console. My personal experience indicates that I have not encountered any game-related issues such as lagging or crashing, and have always experienced seamless gameplay with accurate physics. Despite having spent a considerable amount of time, approximately 20-30 hours, on the game, I have only encountered my first glitch. I hope that you too are able to resolve any issues and enjoy the game to the fullest extent possible. o7",

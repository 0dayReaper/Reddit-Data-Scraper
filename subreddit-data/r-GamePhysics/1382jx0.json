There are problems with game balance, for quite a long time you could buy millions of jeeps to essentially become multibillionaire. Even Minecraft bedrock in newer versions is extremely buggy on basically all the platforms. Gamepass is extremely good tho. But sadly both windows and Microsoft games are kinda rushed and they break quite a lot. And I\u2019m using windows professionally, millions bugs which needed hours to fix happened to me. Sorry but after my experience with Microsoft soft I\u2019m not really liking this company. And that\u2019s not even talking about them sending your private data no matter what. Even on pro version.",

The more accurate to your facial expressions and movements you want the rig, the more expensive it gets. You can easily spend thousands, and that's without factoring in things like accessories, outfits, emotes, etc.\n\nIIRC one vtuber I follow said she spent ~$5K on her model and rig alone and she had less than 20K followers at the time, to put things into perspective. The big name vtubers like those in Vshojo/Hololive/etc are spending literal tens of thousands on art and rigging alone anytime one of them redebuts.",

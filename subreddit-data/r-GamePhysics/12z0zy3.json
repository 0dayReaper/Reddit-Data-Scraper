Because the actual Creed or guild or whatever is a total afterthought in the story. They\u2019re just bald people in animal fur with sticks and stuff, which was baffling. I guess Ezio made some bad investments and that\u2019s why they\u2019re hobos now? I\u2019m hard pressed thinking of an actual \u201cassassination\u201d from that game. \n\nBest pirate game I ever played tho. 10/10. I really enjoyed just being a pirate, sailing, battling, whaling, etc. (also the shanties are great for if you\u2019re falling asleep on a long drive. Singing along keeps you awake and alert, which I imagine is the beautiful lizard brain reason why they did it.",

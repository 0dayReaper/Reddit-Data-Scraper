Basically, for clients (non-hosts) the engine will send basic information to the host about the direction each character is moving and the speed at which they're moving (and animation state/what weapons they're carrying, etc.), and then every few seconds it'll send the xyz coords. sending the direction and speed at which the character is going allows each individual client to calculate the physics based on what's going on exactly on their screen, but sometimes something is off, which is why when the exact xyz coords are sent things will \"jump\" to their actual place. This ends up being pretty efficient in that the networks players are playing on don't have to be perfect since it's not sending constant XYZ updates for everything in the world. ",

But I'd guess something like the following:\n\nWhen the truck closes the helicopter is \"anchored\" to the truck because part of it is inside. We also have two separate physics bodies intersecting, so the engine tries to resolve this by applying forces to the bodies to pull them apart, the magnitude and angle of these forces might be a bit randomised.\n\nSince the two bodies are \"anchored\" the engine applies the sum of all forces to a combined body to keep them together, causing them to dance around.\n\nThese combined forces either cancel out gravity, or gravity is simply ignored when trying to pull apart two intersecting bodies to improve the odds of them pulling apart.\n\nEDIT: anchoring probably happens to prevent things from sliding around inside the truck while it is moving.

Where as if the object is fully inside it could be handled. \n\nMy best guess is an open trucks hitbox is hugging the inside of the truck, and when the door closes it becomes a full object(that\u2019s how items stay inside of the truck). Now there\u2019s also collision physics at play(when two objects run into one another), and being \u201cinside\u201d that object is throwing a variable way off(usually negative math, happened in Eve online as well with falloff/optimal ranges on turrets).\n\nThe math being off can produce some awfully weird forces acting upon the object in the physics engine, some worse than others.\n\nTLDR; being inside the trucks doors hitbox when closed provides a nasty case where bad force math occurs on a technical collision. Sending shit everywhere. ",

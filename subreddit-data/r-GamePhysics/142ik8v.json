Over a decade later this obsession continued and carried into the games that I make now :)\n\nI wanted to combine the mesmerizing physics of falling sand games with more of an 'objective'. I came up with Sandbox Skyline, a game where you build skyscrapers from falling sand, and then have to protect them against the forces of nature (storms, tsunamis, landslides etc). I think I struck a good balance between a relaxing yet challenging game. I just released a [demo of the game on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2307840/Sandbox_Skyline/) if you'd like to try it.\n\nCheers",

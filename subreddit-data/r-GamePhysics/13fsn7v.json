With the such confined space a laptop it has it limits the user to not very much room to make upgrades. I\u2019ve tried the tests out myself. My buddy has a gaming laptop and we ran tests of all sorts even though he has some of the same parts or supposedly the same parts as me (I say supposedly because they\u2019re not as fast/good as the desktop counterparts) the desktop was at least 2.5 times faster and smoother than the laptop along with the graphics being ALOT better on the desktop.",

[CPU](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/3862vs5232/AMD-Ryzen-9-5950X-vs-AMD-Ryzen-9-7945HX). [GPU.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTizHip5FjU) If you're comfortable with being roughly one generation behind in terms of performance there's nothing wrong with running one. The problem is a lot of laptops have poor thermal design which can hamper their performance relative to the parts they have, but that just means doing the research before buying.",

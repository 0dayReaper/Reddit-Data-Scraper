An operator called IQ can see electronics like this cardiac sensor when its being used, thus his position can be compromised.

Another is Dokkaebi, who can make every defender's phones begin ringing (aside from specific cases) which is very useful in picking up roamers and flankers like Pulse. \n\nJackal can see footprints and can tell when a defender has been wandering around, Thatcher can disable his sensor temporarily, the shield operators can guess where he's hiding based on the map and wait for him to try to wallbang, etc.\n\nSiege is heavily based around planning since there's like 18 operators on each side, using camera drones to scout corners, knowing where to breach to limit ambushes, etc.\n\nPulse is actually kinda bad IMO since his sensor is loud, takes a long time to open and close, has a very short range, and can be counter played very easily. You focus on the sensor and get tunnel vision, limiting your peripheral vision and you can't see down hallways. Plus his head is ugly.",

Normally when your limbs contact the inside collision mesh of a normal object like this it will just either push you out gently or fling you outwards/laterally to correct the error. \n\nMy best guess is that because I jumped prior and landed right on/inside the very edge of the object's mesh with half my body outside the mesh the game both miscalculated the acceleration and just took the preexisting direction (up) and went \"fling upwards to remove from object.\"\n\nActually, upon review, I think I may have figured it out. During the slow mo you can see that my skater's right arm is protruding from the opposite side of the sign. That would mean the arm is contacting *both* meshes at the same time, and any lateral force applied would mean it's pushed in both directions but since it's connected to the skater's body it just takes the skater and pushes her vertically riding along the entire mesh to the top where she can be ejected.",

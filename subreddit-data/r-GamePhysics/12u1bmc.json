They've made stuff like getting the head stomp much more consistent and it's much easier to gain room when you feel you need it but then the dodge you get can be very difficult and javku to get to activate properly so much so that despite me having a perk that says if I successfully time a dodge I get hp back I don't really like using it cause I couldnt get it to work consistently even against a slow moving Thug. It's not that it's not doing it's thing of avoiding damage but that you're supposed to time it and if you do you'll get bonuses\n\nAnd as you can see some of the body and object physics are very much similar to dead island 1 and riptide.",

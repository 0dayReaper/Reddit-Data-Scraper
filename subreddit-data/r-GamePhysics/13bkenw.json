Slash by left mouse button, overhead and stab are from scrolling the mouse wheel forward or backwards. Compared to the direction you swipe your mouse before attacking in Mordhau dictating what kind of attack you perform. Blocking can be held and is not only for half a second as in Mordhau. The came functions very similarly besides those differences and both have a similar flow to the combat with initiative and throwing people off with switching attack patterns and feinting during combos. Chivalry has both a jab and a kick, the first is used against an incoming attack, the latter to stagger someone who is blocking. Chivalry also has no perks, but different classes have minor differences inbetween them like health, armour, their special attack and a special ability like throwing a health kit or a flaming pot of oil which recharges over time or under certain circumstances.",

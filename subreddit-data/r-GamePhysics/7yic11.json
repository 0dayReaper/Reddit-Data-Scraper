I know that in 1993, Nintendo released an enhanced NES compilation titled *Super Mario All-Stars*. It includes the Super Mario Bros. games released for the Famicom/NES. The version of Super Mario Bros. 2 included in the compilation has improved graphics and sound to match the Super NES's 16-bit capabilities, as well as minor alterations in some collision mechanics. It is possible to change the character after losing a single life, while the original version allows changing it only after completing a level or when the player loses all their lives and chooses \"Continue\", making the game more forgiving when choosing a character not adept at some specific lev\n\n\"There it is,\" Mario stood at bridge leading up to the castle of his enemy. He was starting to get excited about heading inside, but not for the same reason his younger brother and Toad thought. This would usually be the part where he'd tell Luigi to stay behind while he handled Bowser. However, much to his annoyance, Toad wanted to go which would end up complicating things. As much as he liked Toad, he was far too nosy and a big mouth to tag along. What if he found out about what he was really here for?\n\n\"What are ya waitin' for?\" grinned Toad as he brushed past the man and ran onto the bridge. \"Let's save the princess!\"\n\nMario groaned and followed the little mushroom person to the castle. Much to his relief, the only entrance inside was a small door on the side of the castle being used by goombas. The three of them donned goomba suits. To Mario's relief, Luigi couldn't squat down enough to get inside so it left him with Toad. He could easily ditch the short mushroom and take off running to his target. However Toad was a lot harder to shake off than Mario thought. Despite his tiny legs, Toad was able to keep up with Mario and continued to stay a few steps behind the man. The plumber attempted to tell him that Toad should go save Peach while he dealt with Bowser. However he was much too eager to help Mario as he wanted to \"get a few swings in\" for constantly kidnapping his friend. It was only when they got to a double hallway was when he finally got the chance to split from him. He told Toad to go one way while he went the other. Before Toad could either protest or agree, the plumber felt himself descending down a slide before getting thrown onto a large bed that could easily hold more than 10 men. It was covered with red silk sheets and large fluffy pillows. On the right nightstand was a large almost empty bottle of strawberry scented lubricate along with a large dildo coated with said lube.\n\n\"Couldn't wait to get started, could he?\" he smirked chuckling to himself before stripping off his clothes as well. Bowser never did have the patience to wait for him. Then again it had taken him a long time to get to the large lizard-like man. Mario had just barely started taking off his boxers when Bowser came into the bedroom.\n\n\"M-mario!\" he exclaimed turned red in the face. He had just come from outside of his bedroom from dealing with the Koopalings' constant bickering only to find Mario naked inside of his bedroom. \"How the hell did you get here?\"\n\n\"You tell me!\" He pointed at the ceiling. \"I came from up there.\"\n\n\"Oh that,\" he groaned. \"I must have accidentally pressed a lever when I was dealing with those brats of mine.\"\n\n\"Good thing it was me and not someone else finding your little secret,\" the plumber said as he picked up the large dildo. \"Imagine your underlings finding their master's big dong hanging around. Wouldn't want them to get the wrong idea that you're fucking Peach...that or you're gay.\"\n\nBowser had to laugh at that. It was no secret to the large lizard that his minions thought he was screwing around with the princess. That or he was constantly making her wear sexy outfits for his own personal pleasure. Seeing a sex toy in his bedroom would only \"confirm\" those spreading rumors. He highly doubted any of his minions thought he was gay and that was a good thing. He was sure his minions would be pissed to find out that he didn't even like Peach anymore this whole time. That he was only doing this to give Mario an excuse to come over. This might lead to a lot of his underlings leaving him for some other king. No, nobody could know. Besides, he liked the thrill of sleeping with his \"enemy\" while said enemy's friends were in the castle.\n\n\"Are you just going to stand there or what?\" called over Mario. The two of them didn't have all day considering Toad or Luigi could be trying to get in any moment if they ever found Bowser's room. Bowser apologized before climbing on the bed to get started before someone needed him or one of Mario's pals came. Mario reached over to the bottle of lubricant. \"Think we have enough?\"\n\n\"I'm sure, now hurry up and take the mushroom,\" he quickly shoved a red mushroom into the man's hands before getting down on his hands and knees on the bed. Mario grinned as he uncapped the bottle and proceeded to squirt a large amount into his hand. Now it was time for the fun part.",

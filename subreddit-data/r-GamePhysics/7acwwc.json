Mowing everything in sight is pretty good. I like the community more than anything though. People have been really nice since I started playing and I can't really complain about that. Though there was one co-op battle where the AI kept calling artillery on our position that was WIDE open making it really difficult to keep going. 7 or 8 of us would die in it and it was the only real cover. As an MG it was the only feasible spot. Really pissed everyone off. ",

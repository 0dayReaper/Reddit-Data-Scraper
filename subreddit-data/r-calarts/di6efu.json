    "postText": "hey everyone,\n\nI'm a junior (HS) and interested in doing acting and dance ***or*** acting and Musical Art/Experimental Pop as a double major.\n\nWhich combo do you think is more manageable and makes more sense ? \n\nIs the program good for either (separately) if I don't go for the double major deal ?\n\nWhat's the program like ? Ex of things you learn, do, opportunities, facilities etc...\n\nWhat about the \"study abroad opportunities\" ? Worth looking at or hard pass ? \n\nWhat major/important points would you have as pros and cons about this university ? \n\nThank you :) I appreciate any responses",

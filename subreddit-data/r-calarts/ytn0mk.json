    "postText": "I got sick at the beginning of junior year and unfortunately that lead to me nearly flunking it so my gpa isn't the best but I feel like my portfolio is well done. I saw CalArts doesn't even look at ACT scores but if it DOES matter it's well above national average. I also go to the top schools in the nationals (top ten in magnet schools, top 20 in national schools, #1 in the state).",

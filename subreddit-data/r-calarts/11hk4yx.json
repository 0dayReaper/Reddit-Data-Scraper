    "postText": "I want to apply for CalArts and start in 2024. I'm an international student and I didn't made any work since high school. I graduated in 2019 and I do not own any serious cameras or equipment in my house. I only created one movie which is 14 min long and he got selected for a  movie festival in my country. I wanted to put it in my portfolio but they want a film of up to 10 min and I'm afraid I do not have anything to send to them. Should I send the movie anyway? Will they accept it although it's been a while since I made it?",

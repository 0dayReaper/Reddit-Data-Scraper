    "postText": "For anyone who is currently enrolled in the CAL ARTS film program, what sort of portfolio did you submit, in regards to narrative and style? Also, what did you write about for your artist statement regarding your own work, meaning how did you articulate intent/vision. Finally, I would also like to know if it is necessary to have a portfolio review of my work, even if there is very limited time. \n\nThank you for your time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "comment": "My answers will be different considering I'm in a different program, but as for the artist statement you want to show:\n\n* Your goal \n* Why this goal\n* Your message\n \n[This](http://breadandpuppet.org/cheap-art/why-cheap-art-manifesto) is a really popular manifesto that I think encapsulates this.\n\n* Goal: Change opinion that art is for the privileged\n* Why: Because no single group of people can own art\n* Message: Art is cheap and for everyone\n\nAlso, if you're talking about asking for a portfolio review during your interview, I honestly don't know. On one hand, its a good way to gauge if you think it is worth it to come to this school based on their answers and critiques, but also the interview is about them wanting to know more about you and they have already seen (hopefully lol) the portfolio you submitted.\n\nI know you're looking for a film student's perspective but this sub is kinda dead, and I remember how stressful applications are. So if you have anymore questions, feel free to ask",

    "postText": "Hey y'all, for anyone who's applying to the character animation program, is anyone else's sketchbook status \"awaiting\" because I'm a little scared that my sketchbook was not delivered? I know there's a lot of sketchbooks to go through, but I would've thought by now that it would have said \"Recieved\". How long does it take for them to process the sketchbook? I'm super nervous that my application might get auto-rejected because of this blegh.",

            "comment": "Mine was like that too and it drove me crazy. In my case, it took about seven days for them to process the sketchbook from the time that it was actually marked delivered using my tracking number. This was awful, as it was marked received exactly zero business days before the deadline. So long as you adhered the CalArts mailing label to the package and the shipping sent it on time, you shouldn\u2019t worry. :) it\u2019s totally possible they are having clerical errors due to the large number of applicants. I don\u2019t know if it will do the same for you, but it helped me to stalk my package using the tracking number to ensure it got where it should. The tracking will of course also tell you if it has actually gotten delivered and exactly where it has been delivered.",

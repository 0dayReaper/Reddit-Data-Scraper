Don\u2019t say you had no idea what you were doing, because that\u2019s very degrading and putting WAY too much value on your perceived mistakes.\n\n1.) There\u2019s no such thing as finding validation in this world. If validation exists, it only exists as a chemical in your mind. Therefore validation is something in YOU, that you can literally give yourself. We are here to express happiness, not find it. Because implicating that we need to find happiness implicates that we can\u2019t be happy on our own/somehow are not whole, which is NOT true. We are the source of our happiness, and we don\u2019t need to be good enough, nor are we doomed by being not enough. We are neither good or bad enough, but observers of that information. If you believe you ARE the person that is validated or invalid, then you are stringing yourself along to get hurt every time validation goes away because you believe that to be you.\nYou are that which cannot be valid or invalid, and that makes you stronger then either of those things. Be nice to yourself!\n\n2.) Love yourself, and you will in turn inspire others to love themselves, thus giving them love by showing them the love they have.\n\n3.) Just keep drawing. AND have lots of fun! Relax, go hang out with friends, and draw when you feel like it. Allow art to happen in front of you, and don\u2019t stop yourself from having fun.\n\n4.) You\u2019re gonna do great bud. :3 ;3 I promise you\u2019ll get in, if you keep applying and trying. I know people who didn\u2019t get into CalArts after 4 or 6 tries! But they all got in because they were at a point when they didn\u2019t let feelings of invalidation have power over their art!",

I did attend the summer animation residency, which is like CSSSA for adults.)\n\n1.) Make sure the colors aren\u2019t too muddy, and that you are being clear about what\u2019s brown, green, etc. Step back and add clean transitions to help the piece\u2019s colors interact more smoothly. Also work on color mixing and find some colors in real life that really inspire you. Go into nature and really allow yourself to be inspired.\n\n2.) Make sure that things in the background are not overly lost, so we get a clear idea of the composition. Blurryness can indicate atmosphere or something farther away, but it must be done carefully. Look at the way real faraway things like nature or far away mountains show atmosphere. Also look at motion blurs in photographs to get inspired in painting movement.\n\n3.) Really step back from the piece and check how the axe looks depth wise. Personally I\u2019d get a real axe and through personal observation see how it looks depth-wise at the same camera angle you\u2019re painting.\n\n4.) Take a look at some clean gouache paintings by CalArts students (mobblele\u2019s CalArts accepted sketchbook on YouTube has some gouache observations that come to mind). You\u2019ll want to strive for clarity, readability and storytelling when doing gouache for a CSSSA painted portfolio piece.\n\n5.) Good luck! Hope you get in!!!",

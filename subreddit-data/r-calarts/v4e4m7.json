    "postText": "I'm a student who struggles in academics. This year was especially hard because a few teachers were switched around and in general, I'm not the best at adapting change. However, I scored high in my art classes and am very devoted to the craft. I plan to take the SAT in Fall, but I'm worried that my 2.5 average would hinder me. I'm a Junior who still has Senior year to look forward to, but I don't know if it will be enough. Is there anything I can do?",

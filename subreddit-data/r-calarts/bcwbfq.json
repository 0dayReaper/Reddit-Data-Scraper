    "postText": "Hi all! I'm going to be transferring to CalArts soon (Or expect to if I get in) and have a question.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I'm in community college (An accredited college)  currently, no degree, but tons of credits. Now, do I need a degree for my credits to transfer over? Or can I transfer without a degree and still get my credits transferred over? (If they meet the class requirements).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI plan on going into Character Animation by the way, and I know its a 4-year program no exceptions, unlike the other programs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd really love some comments! Thanks :-)",

Some critical studies classes are required for your major though. \n\nThat being said all of the classes you take that are specific to character animation and the requirements of that major, you will have to take. That's the nature of BFA degrees as I understand it. \n\nHope this helped.",

            "comment": "I'll be entering as a music student, but hopefully my experience will be helpful. I will be transferring from a CC. I have a previous AA (in a different subject, where I earned most of my gen-ed credits), but I will not graduate with a Music AA prior to transferring. And they didn't seem to care about that.   \n\n\nAt CalArts for the music school, you have to take music theory/skill placement tests to see where you place in their curriculum; essentially, a chance to test out of lower-level classes. If not for the theory classes I've taken in the last two years, I wouldn't feel prepared. But I do, and it's pretty much on track with the curriculum I've been studying. So it's not a credits transfer, per se, as much as it is an \"equivalent-knowledge\" transfer.",

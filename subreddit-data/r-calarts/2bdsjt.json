We've got a campus full of people who are constantly creating amazing content! How do we get people using this subreddit? \n\nI'm open to ideas, but here are some of mine.\n\n1. Spray paint \"/r/calarts\" all over the floor where we can paint on the walls.\n2. encourage our classmates to checkout/ post cool stuff on the subreddit.\n3. Post exclusive content to the subreddit. Like, if you are a musician, post a song only on here, just for CalArts students.\n\nAny other ideas?",

I'm a frequent redditor, as well. I think your ideas are fantastic. Especially for those who eschew traditional social media, Reddit might be the way to go. ",

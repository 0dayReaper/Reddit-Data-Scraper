    "postText": "Can you only apply to Calarts if you're fresh out of high school? \n\nWhat if you went to a different art college and felt that you wanted to continue your education but at a better school? Could you do that? \n\nWould storyboarding be under the animation degree or would it be under something else? \n\nThe school I went to wasn't great and at the time I didn't even know Calarts existed. It wasn't until I was already in college on the westcoast (i came from the Midwest) that I found out about it. I always hear that it's a good school and people who go there seem to be more likely to get jobs in the industry after graduation. I wanted to do either storyboarding or concept art but the school I went too was very...scattered? It was more of a sampler platter of a bunch of different things as opposed to focusing in on something. \n\nI'm just curious. I don't know if it would be affordable but I figured I'd ask.\n\nThanks.",

I was enrolled in the MA Aesthetics &amp; Politics program in one of its earlier classes. That program is mainly theory based and it did attract people from very different backgrounds. The feeling I got around the campus was generally that most programs were open to people coming in from different backgrounds, and I think you see more of that at the graduate level. I know a lot of our non-core theory classes were filled with grad students from across the school, and we were also welcome to enroll in classes in different programs if they were relevant to our studies.",

I did have to start from year 1 tho, that's how Calarts curriculum is structured, but it's def not late to go. You'd be surprised to know how many ppl in their mid to late 20s and even 30s come to Calarts to have a fresh start as an animator. And yes, storyboarding would fall under animation program, either in Character or Experimental, depending on what kind of animation you like.",

I thought with me being 30 next year it would be too late. At least now I know I have some time to think about it. Thank you.",

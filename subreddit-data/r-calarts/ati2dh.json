            "comment": "Hey, CalArts student here! Whatcha wanna know?? As far as your question about life here, it's very different from most schools I hear. Almost every event is stident-run, people are passionate about what they do so people are often working (especially 3rd and 4th years), and also there's a pretty big party life (I don't participate much). It also can be a big melting pot for nerds (like myself) in most cases too, which is fun because you end up around a lot of like-minded people.",

I believe it's pretty much the same for most programs, but for character animation I think you submit some sort of sketchbook. What program are you aiming for? The application itself is pretty chill, it just takes time to fill everything out. As far as getting accepted, I know they have a super low acceptance rate (below 20% for my school at least). Classes are actually rather chill, though most of your workload will probably end up being from projects outside class. Yes I am in dorms, they are actually very nice and spacious :)",

Im guessing it has to be very long and of good quality.The 20% acceptance rate is pretty scary,it seems so low i hope i can make it in,there must be so many people who apply.The whole atmosphere and feel of the place sounds really good.I make music too! But i wont study for it though.Thats weird,I thought the application would be super tough",

In all honesty nobody except the admission people really know what they are looking for. However, for character animation, I've heard rumors that the biggest thing they look for is your ability to tell story through your drawings. Your characters need to be able to portray their emotions and a bit into their life at a glance. If CalArts is your dream school, I would absolutely recommend coming to the campus and going on a character animation tour and asking these sorts of questions in your info session. Also (not to discourage you here!) I believe the acceptance rate for character animation is the lowest in the school. It's around 10% if I recall. It's common for people to not get in on their first try. Many people I know did not, but are amazing and fantastic artists. Best of luck!!!",

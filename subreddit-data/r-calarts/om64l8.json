If you're a woman, part of the LGBT+ community, in a minority group, etc. Seek out scholarships that are looking for people who fit your description. There are also many scholarship finder websites that you can check boxes and they'll give you a list of scholarships you apply for. Hope this helps.",

That's unfortunate, I didn't get much from CalArts either. \n\nHere's a good website I found for looking at scholarships you're eligible for: [https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/scholarship-search#!welcome](https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/scholarship-search#!welcome)\n\nThere are other sites that do the same thing, but a lot of them want you to make an account. For this one you don't need an account, but you can try those too if you'd like. Just look up on google \"scholarship finder\".",

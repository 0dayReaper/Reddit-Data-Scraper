Should I attend my second choice school (that gave me plenty of scholarship) and possibly transfer after some time and try to reapply then?",

There are quite a lot of ppl who didn't get any financial aids yet and apparently the school is still working on the packages, so u might get one later on! Also, even if you do go to another school and transfer to calarts after a couple yrs, you'd still have to start from the first yr bc of the way the program is structured. You might be able to transfer ur gen ed credits from the school u attended, but it wouldn't shorten the time you have to spend at calarts in order to graduate. This means you would still pay 4 yrs worth of tuition plus the yrs u spend at ur second choice collge. That being said, you could try to vamp up ur port and sketchbook even more and reapply to get more scholarship from the school, which some ppl have done before.",

I think at best you might bet $15 - $20k year, so you would still be looking at $150,000+ in student loans after four years.\n\nIt is an honor to get into CalArts, but there are many other great animation schools out there.  You could even transfer to a California State School like San Jose, Fullerton, Long Beach, or Northridge after two years.  Their out-of-state tuition is half of CalArts tuition and all their animation programs are ranked.",

I know admissions looks at the level of work you present in your portfolio (as well as any transferrable courses for your specific major) when deciding what year to place you in, but you should call them and ask to get a straight answer!",

I\u2019d wait until the last minute to decline Calarts to see if they come up with more aid especially if you really want to be in California. It is quite an honor to be accepted to Calarts. However, in the end it probably doesn\u2019t really matter where you go to school and if your going to be in that much debt it may not be worth it. You could always get you Masters at Calarts on down the road too.",

Some students even just do a year or two and use their connections to get jobs and just don\u2019t get a degree, but they are in the industry working full time",

    "postText": "I'm a junior at Highschool and I am constantly looking for different colleges that might interest me, I want to major in either Character Animation or Illustration so I've been looking into the big-name schools like RISD, RingLing, NYU, obviously CalArts, and such. Like I just said, these are big-name schools, and while researching I found out some shady stuff about RingLing, like over accepting students and then letting the ones that will not last drop out, and everyone knows about the crazy constant tuition rise in CalArts. These are absolutly deal breakers, I know I don't or will have any time soon 50,000+ dollars for tuition...\n\nAnd I don't know if I'm not looking correctly into it, but CalArts page isn't really helpful when looking for information, they don't offer straight forward information like a course overview, just a short blurb; information for student aid or scholarships that isn't very vague... \n\nWell, my point is that I wanted to come here to be able to find first-hand information like what I just mentioned before and stuff like if campus and installations reflect the amount of money that you have to pay to be there.",

            "comment": "Every program is very different, but I'll say this: you don't go there expecting a typical bourgeoisie college experience. It's a grimy former mental hospital. The dorms are old and disgusting.\n\nAnimators get isolated and spend four years doing figure drawing, drafting, character design, etc. It's extremely rigorous, technical, and time-consuming courseload that takes extreme dedication to complete. It is for people who are 100% serious about becoming a Pixar or Disney animator.\n\nOther degrees are less rigorous technically, but still extremely demanding. Critiques are brutal. No matter what degree path you choose, if you don't show up with some good skills, you will be asked to leave or drop. Many simply choose to drop after realizing how much work they have to do if they want to get to the level of most year one students.\n\nThey don't give out many scholarships at Calarts. \n\nThe designers, illustrators, and animators I know got hired right out of school at competitive companies. They are financially better off than most in their field, but it's still a creative field. You have to fight and push for the type of pay you'll need to pay off your loans. Never get lazy.\n\nMy advice:\n\n-Get in touch with admissions and see if they'll visit your high school and speak to you and fellow artists at your school. You might also go visit in person (there are a few schools in CA, so you could do quite a few). \n\n-Go on youtube and look up some admitted sketchbooks for character animation at Calarts. That will give you an idea about what they're looking for during the admissions process.\n\n-Begin developing your technical skills ASAP. You should be figure drawing multiple times a week, drawing in a sketchbook every day, and mastering the human anatomy",

            "comment": "I did it go for character animation but I can shed some light on the school itself.\nCalarts is not about the campus or the facilities but it\u2019s the people and network and what you get from those. The campus is not the nicest and it\u2019s pretty dated and lackluster especially for the price. But you cannot replace those connections at Calarts.",

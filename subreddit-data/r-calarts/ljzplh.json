If you\u2019re here for just the name go somewhere else cause some not all big named people from here didn\u2019t even graduate. CalArts is a pretty big melting pot that embraces all arts, but what they don\u2019t want is a cookie cutter idea of arts.\n\nSpecific questions for experimental animation I don\u2019t know cause I\u2019m not a EA major. I was in the theatre program for lighting, but my interviewer really was wanting to know why I wanted to go to CalArts cause he told me that CalArts isn\u2019t the answer for all artists and I needed to be dedicated to the idea of what it meant to be a lighting designer. I can say that I almost quit twice, cause you take a lot out on yourself trying to keep up with school work.",

I have attended a uninversity (majoring in philosophy) for a year but dropped out and thats already two years ago, so i dont think i can ask a rec from them.\n\nCan anyone give me an advice concerning this? also, does GPA matter when you apply to Calarts?",

            "comment": "The application says it can be a teacher, mentor, or anyone that knows you as an artist. Do you have someone in the art world that served as a mentor or inspired you along the way that you have a connection with? Your portfolio is more important than GPA by far. If your a good enough artist by CalArts standards you\u2019ll get in, but it\u2019s super hard to get in and some people apply multiple times. Good luck and best wishes",

They don\u2019t want to see anime/fanart and they want drawings directly in the sketchbook. The size and brand of the sketchbook is up to you.\n\nThe portfolio is the observational drawings, gesture drawings, designs etc. that are also evaluated. These are supposed to be different from the drawings done in the sketchbook.",

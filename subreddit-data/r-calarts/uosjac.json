    "postText": "Hi guys! I already got a 10k scholarship but unfortunately that is not enough. My family is a very low income household. However I have payed the deposit because I really want to go, but I keep hoping that I might get additional financial aid. I am an international student in Film and Video school. Any suggestions? I have talked with financial aid offices and they told me they can only grant me 5k of need based. I got an additional 5k from film and video, but do you know if there something left to do? Someone I may contact? I didn\u2019t fill out the CSS form because they told me it wasn\u2019t necessary tho, but if it might helps of course I can fill it out.\n\nThank you guys! Love yaaa",

My situation is that after receiving my award package but before paying the deposit, I emailed my Financial Aid Liaison to negotiate my scholarship. Finally they increased my merit scholarship and SA award (received through campus employment) by 6k because of the email. I think you can mention the amount of money you need exactly and how the scholarships can support your study(like rental\u2026) Good luck to you!",

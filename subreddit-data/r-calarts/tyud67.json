    "postText": "Im not sure how I feel about\ngoing to an intensive school.\nSome of these places have\n60 hours of homework and\nclass. Calarts and ArtCenter seemed compelling but Im not sure I can handle the amount of work they give. \n\nI am certain I want to be in\nthe animation industry but I\nalso want a social life and\nhave other hobbies. Art is\nsacred to me and doing it\nthis much to that extreme\nmight ruin it for me.\nObviously you work for a\nlong time in the industry but\nit is also important to\nmaintain work life balance. Animators probably still have friends to hang out and a family to connect with. This is supposed to simulate the real industry but I want to be of sound mental health. It\u2019s like going to Harvard, you may be smart but also want to have more to do besides your school. I can barely stay awake in high school. Imagine falling asleep in something I love. \n\nI am generally someone who learns differently than the typical person. I got ADHD to I learn slower and in more specific ways. Just because a glen keane or Bancroft brother learned at Calarts doesn\u2019t mean I will reach their level by learning the way they did. Maybe online is better despite college being the way people respect most and the most \u201cefficient\u201d way to enter the industry.\n\nMy dad told me I don\u2019t have the stamina to run a studio if I want other things in my life. My dad is a businessman who sacrificed his social life in college to start a family business. I have so many stories I have planned out and hope to animate one day. But perhaps I will end up being a happy grunt. I love hearing stories of animation titans but perhaps the ants are the happiest. Maybe I find I want to spend time with my future kids rather than expand into my own content. Do I have to learn this way in order to succeed and make my own content. Perhaps I can do animation but relestate on the side. This way I can fund my own content with the wealth of the family business. \n\nIn addition the animation industry is incredibly broad. What if I prefer concept art and storyboard and hate animation. I need to take a serious animation class to find out my path. \n\nThis was an enlightening experience but I also can\u2019t help but feel depressed or intimidated. I am also somebody who doesn't deal with stress well. I want to be happy because that\u2019s what I define true success.",

    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI'm looking into making my graduate studies at CalArts a reality.  First question: where should I look for housing and what kind of costs can I expect?  Is it possible to rent a room somewhere for around 1k/month (or maybe a little less?)\n\nI've also been thinking about applying for the graduate dorms.  It might be a little cheaper.  I'm assuming housing is only allowed there during fall spring session.   Are people living in them over the winter session?  Is that part of the cost I see listed on the CalArts website?  Also, can anyone tell me the graduate dorms are like...what the people are like.  I'm a little older than the typical grad student age, and generally like a pretty quiet living environment.  Also, I have never lived in a dorm before....so I'm not really sure what I'm getting myself into.",

Hollywood, Atwater, North Hollywood, Silver Lake, Los Feliz, Glendale\u2014anything like that where you\u2019re pretty close to the 5 freeway. It\u2019s a reverse commute and takes 30m reliably, but you\u2019re moving because you\u2019re leaving LA when everyone else is trying to get in.\n\nI lived off Barham Blvd (inches from the 101) in the low hills in a little bungalow. No idea about today\u2019s costs. But, IMO, half the point of attending CalArts is proximity to one of the greatest art scenes in the US. Particularly as an older student (as I was) you will want to be closer to all the stuff\u2014many students live in the city.\n\nSanta Clarita basically sucks. The grad student housing isn\u2019t terrible, but try to swing living in the city. Just not the west side or south of the 10 freeway.",

Not set on calarts as I am more interested in Ringling, but check out calarts extended studies! they have several online animation class applications open she could apply to, some focus on portfolio development! I am taking the Portfolio Workshop for Artists and Animators course this summer, and applications are still open! everything is online as well, so it can be done comfortably at home! dm me if you want to talk more!",

            "comment": "That is very sweet of u to figure this out for ur little sister! Id say that the best way for high schoolers to prepare for their Calarts portfolio is to attend CSSSA, but since it's obviously not an option for her this yr, I'd recommend their online classes just like the other person commented. I took John Mahoney's portfolio dev class and character design class and both were very helpful in kickstarting my portfolio since a lot of cover materials you can use in either sketchbook or the portfolio. Other than that, tell her to keep a sketchbook, bring it around with her, and draw whatever she sees wherever she goes. It doesn't have to be good; she still has a yr to go, so there is a lot of time to improve even more. But just make a habit of keeping sketchbook, without thinking that's the one she's gonna send to Calarts. If she continues to make those, by the time she applies she'll have her picks as to which ones to send. If she could, attend figure drawing sessions with life models as well!! Also look into Portfolio Day. I'm not sure if it's gonna happen any time soon, but if it does while she's in the process of putting together her portfolio, def go to Portfolio Day and get some feedbacks! Hope this helps!! Good luck to her!",

            "comment": "I'm a music student but I used to be very serious about visual art back in high school. Ended up coming here for music after realizing a lot about myself.\n\nGet her started in some life drawing classes (obviously with covid, probably will be online). Maybe she could take some online summer courses at a local community college? \n\nYou're going to be submitting a sketchbook and a portfolio. For the sketchbook, some people might have an instinct to think \"well CalArts is known for animation so I should draw cartoons/character designs!\" That's wrong and doing so will wind up with a rejection letter. CalArts doesn't look to see if you're good at cartoons/character design, they look for your understanding of human anatomy, animal anatomy, drawing objects from life, scenery/architecture, story telling through your art, and getting to know who you are as an artist through all of that.\n\nIf you take a look at accepted and rejected sketchbooks on YouTube, you can why the ones that were rejected were rejected. Typically it's due to the fact that way too much of their sketchbook is either focus on drawing cartoons/character designs or is being too focused on drawing for what they think CalArts wants to see instead of the applicant showing who they are as an artist. Make sure her portfolio is of things that show who she is or how she expresses herself as an artist.\n\nIf she's applying to the animation department, don't be discouraged if she get rejected the first one or two times. I've heard around at the school that the animation department has a less than 5% acceptance rate (not sure if 100% true but I wouldn't be surprised due to how many people apply). I've had friends who were good artists who didn't get in even after applying 3 times, yet I knew a few who worked on areas they needed to and ended up getting in.\n\nAlso consider mass-applying to grants and scholarships that your sister can get when the time comes. There are many and CalArts even offers scholarships themselves (but it's not that much), but the school is just that expensive. The total cost will come out to around $250,000 when all is said and done (including dorm, meal plan, tuition), so it's best to chip it down as much as you possibly can. There's also student loans which are also an option, but I'd recommend grants and scholarships first. \n\n[Here's the CalArts page on portfolio and sketchbook requirements](https://calarts.edu/admissions/portfolio-audition-requirements/film-video/character-animation). You can also look up tons of videos/portfolios of accepted students. Good luck! :)",

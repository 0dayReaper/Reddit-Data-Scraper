Sending in a late application for a BFA in voice arts because they are still accepting applicants. wondering if anyone knows how hard this program is to get into or if it is a good program. I know the big thing about this school is animation but niche gave it really high performing arts and music rankings. Any voice arts or other music program people have any answers for me???",

Read the bios of the professors, find some vocalists on Instagram to see what they\u2019re doing. Good luck! You can dm if you want.",

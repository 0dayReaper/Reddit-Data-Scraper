            "comment": "sorry, a bit late, but admission is strictly based on how good your portfolio is (gpa is not considered at all in the process.) I think there's no harm in sending in a sketchbook right outside of high school, but a ton of people at the school are transfers who got in after a few years at a less competitive art school/community college in order to develop their artistic perspective and style. Again, admissions is strictly based on your portfolio, and sending in your sketchbook has absolutely no risk. Getting rejected once doesn't impact your ability to get in later.  Hope this helps!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSource: currently studying here!",

One thing to be a bit careful of, especially if you\u2019re going to spend a few years at another art school, is that there\u2019s a huge likelihood your credits won\u2019t transfer, and you\u2019ll have to spend the full 4 years tuition. Because the curriculum is so unique &amp; arts focused, I know a ton of people who spent a year or two at CCA or Sarah Lawrence (and spent a year or two of tuition) and are still entering as BFA 1\u2019s (despite doing a few years of college already) because their credits didn\u2019t transfer. Good luck!",

I would ask the admissions office about this since I\u2019m not an expert, but I think you\u2019re required to start from the beginning in terms of your major-specific classes, and you can transfer general education credits to get out of your critical studies classes. Example: I\u2019m in film, and have a few friends who transferred from various liberal arts colleges after a few years who still need to start from the beginning in our major-specific classes (cinematography, film history, etc), but have enough gen ed credits from their previous college to skip a year or two of critical studies courses here. I would still ask admissions, however!",

I know a few people who spent a year or two at film school (or not even at film school, just working in-industry) and were able to test out of intro to cinematography / editing because their prerequisite knowledge was extremely strong.

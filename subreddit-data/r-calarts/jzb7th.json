    "postText": "Hey everybody! This is my first post in here, and it\u2019s a pretty lengthy question, and I appreciate any responses I get. I\u2019m currently a second year at UCI pursuing a computer game science degree. I feel like the UC system may not be for me, and I\u2019ve been really exhausted by it, as well as needing to take classes I feel I really don\u2019t need for what I want my future career to be.\n\nI\u2019ve always had a really strong interest in the arts, namely game design, film, and animation; especially being inspired by countless CalArts graduates. I did a small after-school program with CalArts back in high school, and I really enjoyed it, and it gave me a taste of what CalArts life was like.\n\nWith that being said, recently I\u2019ve been wanting to transfer out of this school more and more for a multitude of reasons (although it may be an adverse effect of going to school during the pandemic). Namely (as I mentioned before) needing to take class I may not need, feeling like I don\u2019t belong at this school,  and just other personal reasons.\n\nSo back to the main point, I wanted to know from CalArts students themselves what school there is like; namely the animation and film scene. I\u2019m aware that there isn\u2019t a Game Design program or major, but have heard about there being classes related to that general subject. With this limited information, do you, Reddit stranger who only knows me through this Reddit post, feel that transferring to CalArts may be the right choice?",

They have a pretty strong game art program and an animation program that's heavily based on cg. Calarts focuses more on 2d hand drawin approach, which, if that's what you want to do, is great! But if you're looking to apply your knowledge and experience with computer science to animation, schools like Ringling could be a better fit. I haven't been to campus because of the pandemic, but I'm sure someone else could answer you on how campus life and animation scene is like. If you have any general questions on transferring pm me! Good luck!",

Although I had been studying game design, and have a strong interest, I feel I have as much of a passion in, if not, stronger, 2d art and animation. Regardless, game design can always be a side project. Thank you so much for the offer, I\u2019ll make sure to pm you if I have any questions",

            "comment": "Hi! I graduated from UCIrvine film studies and Cal arts film/video masters program so I have experienced both systems. The UC schools can feel very life draining. My first year there I had trouble meeting people and got pretty depressed. They have great counseling services so I talked to someone and everything got better over time. My senior year at UC Irvine was the best time of my life. \n\nI think I know what you mean about the system in place and how it feels. Maybe try switching majors within UCI? If not, then CalArts is so different and more relaxed. You have a lot of freedom as a student and the main focus is on you producing meaningful, expressive, and challenging art. It does not feel oppressive stressful or anything like a traditional school. Movie stars show up and hang out sometimes, kids swim naked in the pool sometimes but everyone works very hard at their art. It\u2019s the most important thing to every student.",

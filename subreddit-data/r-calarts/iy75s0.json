I've been wanting to go to CalArts for a while now but I first want to go to one of the top universities here in my country (It would also be scary for me to move so far away from home) And the problem is that I don't know if I can apply after graduating and I couldn't find anything that gave me an answer. If anyone could tell me that would be great! :\\^)",

            "comment": "CalArts is a very open art school. They really don\u2019t care about academics from your previous school. When you apply they will ask you where you went and if you got a degree, but that\u2019s just for the logistical paperwork. If your applying to CalArts from having a previous degree at a college you could apply to the your program\u2019s BFA program or MFA program you don\u2019t need to have the same degree from a previous school.\nWhat CalArts really cares about is your art! I was in the lighting design program for theatre. When I applied the teachers were looking at my previous lighting design work and paperwork used to make the design possible.\nSo whatever program you are applying for they are going to care about your previous work in the program. Whether that\u2019s graphic design, art, and/or acting.\n\nSomething else people don\u2019t know about CalArts is you can double major any program you just need to be accepted into both. The people who I saw do it were very hard driven and it took a toll on them but they got through it and they work for very well respected companies in there field.",

The teachers aren\u2019t there to tell you what to do they give you a toolbox with as many tools as possible to use to and want you to make something of it.\nYour classes will give you assignment like any regular class would, but don\u2019t think that\u2019s all the school has to offer. With every program in one building it gives you the opportunity to link with other programs.",

    "postText": "Hello, Im a high school senior who is planning on applying for cal arts for the fall of 2020. I was wondering how do people go about affording this college. I've been and am currently applying for scholarships, some are full rides and some are not. I have also been told CalArts doesn't give much financial aid, is this true? Also my mentor told me that a few kids from her high school go to the cal arts animation program all under a full ride scholarship for minority students. She unfortunately does not know the details about the scholarship and she is no longer in contact with her old classmates to ask them. If anyone knows about any information about the scholarship or other ones like it please let me know. Thanks :)",

In the case of a family member being the person eligible for it, they\u2019d have to transfer some of it to you - you aren\u2019t just automatically eligible just bc you\u2019re related to someone in the military. \n\nBut the point is, I know CalArts highly supports that and the Yellow Ribbon Program (supplement to the G.I. Bill). But I don\u2019t know about other opportunities, just wanted to throw that out there :)",

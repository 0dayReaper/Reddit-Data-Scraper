I applied for the BFA in Film/Video and have been eagerly waiting since March 1 \u2014\u00a0especially since CalArts is my top school.\n\nBased on what I've seen from last year's decisions, many animation students heard back March 20th. So my guess is that CalArts will be releasing them closer to that date (i.e. in a few days.)\n\nHopefully we'll hear something soon!",

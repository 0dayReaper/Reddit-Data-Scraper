    "postText": "Myself and a few others have been searching for a short film that aired on the Nicktoons FIlm Festival back in 2005. I have discovered that the Calarts Library has a copy on DVD, but it is not available elsewhere. Would anyone at the school be willing to rip/record it? I want to make sure this stays preserved. The film is April by Jiwook Kim and is available on  **Character animation show, 2004 : open show** : [https://calarts.on.worldcat.org/oclc/56474671](https://calarts.on.worldcat.org/oclc/56474671)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe would be very grateful even to know that it is still there.\n\nThank you.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m a junior in high school and I\u2019m going to be applying to the character animation program this December. I really want to get in and I\u2019m working every day to improve, though am still not a great artist. I didn\u2019t realize that this path was what I wanted until my latter half of high school. I\u2019m currently working in Preston Blair\u2019s animation book. I understand how expensive it is and how little people are accepted. Regardless, I would appreciate any advice, books, videos, links, etc. to guide me on the right path. I\u2019m willing to put in the work.",

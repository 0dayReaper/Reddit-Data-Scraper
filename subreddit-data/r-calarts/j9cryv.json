But there's only about 3ish months or less till the deadline closes. I wanna apply for character animation for reference. I'm decently fast but I also want to take my time.. So would it be too late to start?",

Use that feedback to make the necessary changes to your portfolio! Then attend another and speak to another rep to get more feedback. I think the last ones are like the first week of December. You can also sign up for the virtual info sessions and portfolio tips on their site! I think they do them weekly. IT'S NOT TOO LATE YOU GOT THIS!!",

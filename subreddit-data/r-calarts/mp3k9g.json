            "comment": "I think it's pretty mixed on people who live close and people who commute, personally most people I know are closer to campus. There's some ok transportation, but it's definitely easier to drive or have someone drive you places. Most of the interesting stuff is in LA tbh but it's not too too far.\n\nI'm not an animator, but from personal experience, I've worked with and met a lot of people outside my program! I'm a performer-composer so I've worked with and have some friends in dance, theatre, and character and experimental animation. I think it being a smaller school actually kinda helps with that too. There are definitely classes in all programs that are open to the institute, I think it's actually a requirement to take some classes outside of your major. Gen ed classes are called \"critical studies\" here and they are required, but you have to choose them carefully cause they can be a hit or miss.",

            "comment": "When you say commuter, do you mean people living with their parents and/or driving in from outside of the Santa Clarita area?  If so, then I would say no, CalArts is not a commuter school.  If you are talking about people living off-campus, then yes at least 1/2 of the students live off-campus.  There are only two on-campus dorms, so upperclassmen tend to live in apartments.\n\nCharacter animation is definitely on the animate 24/7 side of the spectrum.\n\nThe school is small - 1500 total with about 400 of those being graduate students.  It is small enough to meet people from all disciplines.  It is small enough that the financial aid office may just catch you in the hallway if they need to talk to you about something.  The animation program is around 200 people total with about 50-70 admitted each year.  The California State schools admit about 200 students a year into their animation programs.  USC admits 13. SCAD has over 2000 in their animation program.  So like Goldilocks, I would say the CalArts program is just right.  Large enough to make good connections and have a variety of talent, but not so large that you get lost in the crowd.\n\nI believe every year of the Character Animation program includes drawing classes, so that would cover illustration.\n\nCalArts calls their GE courses Critical Studies.  You have to take around 40ish hours of Critical Studies for your degree.  However, they are not your average college courses.  They are geared toward artists. For example, your science class might be the study of light and prisms instead of beginning physics.",

I haven't attended the school yet but I will be attending character animation for fall 2021 and I've talked to some current students about some of these. \n\nIn regards to the class being small that is true, it ranges from 40-60ish every year.  Ive heard that you end up working with a lot of the different programs, specifically the music programs when you are needing music for film. \n\nIn regards to the classes, calarts doesn't have an illustration program however you do take classes in character design and other illustration-y type classes, you can see the full required course list here [https://calarts.edu/academics/registrar/academic-requirements/school-of-film-video#characterbfa](https://calarts.edu/academics/registrar/academic-requirements/school-of-film-video#characterbfa) You can also take electives specifically for animation and electives from the other schools as well. As for gen ed, they call those your critical study classes at the school and they are required to graduate (I've heard they r usually pretty easy though) also calarts doesn't do letter grading, they use a pass/nopass system so again classes aren't too bad according to current students I've talked to",

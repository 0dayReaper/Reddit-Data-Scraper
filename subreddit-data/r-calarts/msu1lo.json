    "postText": "Hello. I am Gwendolyn or Gwen, for short (they/them pronouns) and I am an aspiring artist on the autism spectrum. I have been out of school since I graduated from HS in May 2016 and still thinking about going to pursue a post-secondary education in studying animation.\n\nBut aside from that, my question is that how serious are the letters of recommendations at CalArts? Do they require or suggest art teachers? \n\nI haven\u2019t kept in touch with my teachers or high school counselors in a few years, so who can write it? It doesn\u2019t have to be an art teacher or school counselor, does it?",

Those would be great people to write a recommendation.\n\nIf you haven't taken any art classes since graduating, you might want to enroll in some.  It will show that you are continuing to work on your art skills.  Life drawing classes with nude models would be great to take.",

They can certainly help to a degree, but admission at CalArts really looks at the bulk of your artistic work from my experience. I\u2019ve heard of people asking for letters from people very close to there art and some that had nothing to do with Art at all.",

Your recommendation letters do not need to be from your teachers, it can be from someone else as long as they know who you are as an artist. I personally got mine from two of my teachers because they know who I am as an artist and they\u2019re familiar with my work ethic. Your letters aren\u2019t as important as your portfolio is, but you should still submit it as a part of your application. Hope this helps!",

Accepted char animation student here, I wouldn't recommend getting your letter from a parent or family member since they can be very biased, and I've talked to counselors before who have said they dint even read letters that come from family members. Employers is definitely a good one though! I would recommend having at least one recomender who is familiar with your art if possible, and the other one doesn't have to be.",

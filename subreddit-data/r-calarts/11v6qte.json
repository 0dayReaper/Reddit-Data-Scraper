I befriended and lived with several MFAs in Creative Writing as well. \n\nLet me start with saying that any tuition assistance at all is super impressive and you should really factor this rarity in mind. I didn\u2019t know anyone who received school help with costs. This will set you apart and make the load easier. \n\nIt\u2019s really about what you want. Happy to share more.",

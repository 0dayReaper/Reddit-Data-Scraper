You can stylize everything if that's what u r strong at. There's not really a set guideline as to how much should u stylize; all I can say is experiment with different styles and exaggeration, until u find the degree you're most comfortable.\n\nI don't think there is a \"banned\" style, unless u r plagiarizing other artists' works. Ppl do say that putting anime stuff is bad, but I know tons of ppl who put some fanarts and anime-inspired drawings and got in. As long as u put em in moderation and try to showcase ur own art first and foremost, you should be fine.",

Do keep in mind tho, good stylization comes with a strong fundementals and understanding of anatomy, so keep on studying basics alongside cultivating ur style. If u look at Mable Ye's and other animation professionals' sketchbooks you'd understand how a good stylization shows even when they're drawing somewhat realistically. Hope this helps!",

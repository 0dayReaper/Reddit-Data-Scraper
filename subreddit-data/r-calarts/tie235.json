    "postText": "Hello, I was admitted into the Fine Art program at Calarts. For background, I am an inrernational student and probably will be back to my country after I graduate. I can't decide if I should go to Calarts or not. It is my dream school and I have researched one alumni (Dane Nakama) who also did the fine art program and his style has a similar vibe to me. However, I havent heard of anyone else who graduate fine art from Calarts and I dont have much infomation on other alumni or career service after graduation. Help me choose please!",

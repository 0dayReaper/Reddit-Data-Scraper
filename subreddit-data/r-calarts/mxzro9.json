    "postText": "So, this is actually quite a weird story but I am currently a programmer! A Games Programmer to be exact who in his final year of University within the UK. It was something I've wanted to do ever since I was in high school around 6 years ago, but a lot of events during my time at University lead to me massively losing interest in the subject completely. I always wanted to do something creative when I was younger, and strangely I thought programming games was a creative career until I actually learned more about it during my time at Uni. It's likely the least creative aspect of developing games so I'm not sure what I was thinking back then ahaha. It was only when I really learned what it was like to be a programmer in the industry, and actually realized I'll be spending 8 hours a day at a job likely working on such minuscule things that make up a whole game that I knew this wasn't for me.\n\nThe only issue now is I don't really have a career or skill to fall back on. I've spent so much of my time working towards this now undesired goal that I honestly feel kinda stuck. It's really upsetting to know what you wanted to do and had it all planned out for so long to then have all of it lead to nothing. Something during this time that I did start to gain interest in though was art! Likely after discovering the massive community on Twitter. I was always interested in drawing but never really thought I was good enough to even attempt to try to get better. I also think my art class during high school didn't help my motivation either. When I did start getting interested in art though, I actually brought a graphics tablet and started drawing! I'm still a beginner so my art isn't very good currently (If you're interested in seeing some then feel free to message me), but I have on and off been drawing ever since which was around 4 years ago. Mainly this year is when I started to really try to focus on drawing a lot more as this was when I started to massively lose interest in being a programmer.\n\nSo essentially I didn't have a plan but I've become really interested in art. When thinking about what I actually want to do now career-wise since I know I want to do something creative, the idea of working on Cartoons actually came to mind a few times. Considering the stage I'm at, it feels like a really far-fetched idea but I often dream big! I've always adored cartoons, and praise a bunch like Steven Universe, Gravity Falls, and Star vs the Forces of Evil which currently is my biggest inspiration, so the idea of working on them honestly sounds really awesome! I have looked into it a bunch and so far, I'm extremely enthusiastic about the idea. Another far-fetched dream I thought about is going to CalArts and working in California since I do want to work on American cartoons. I don't actually know many British cartoons ahaha.\n\nIt does like I said sound really far-fetched and I imagine silly to some people. But I honestly believe I have the enthusiasm to achieve this goal. I know I won't achieve it if I don't try, and at this point, I don't really have much to lose. I'll have a degree in games programming soon so I can always do that if I absolutely have too, but I know this is what I want. So for the actual question! (Sorry for the long story), I was wondering if anyone had any advice at achieving this goal, becoming a better artist, and actually working towards applying to CalArts? I'll honestly take any advice, even criticism if you think this whole idea is insane. I was also curious what exactly the requirements I'd need as an international student to get into CalArts? Such as will I need an actual degree in Art?",

I just know that I do want to work on shows like the ones I mentioned in my main post, stuff you'll find on Disney XD and Cartoon Network. Though as I researched more into it, of course, it isn't as simple as that. I originally before learning more about the industry thought going into animation, actually animating the scenes and such was the right thing though I discovered that most of that stuff is always outsourced to places like South Korea. My current plan is to possibly aim for storyboarding. It does sound quite cool to make your own worlds, though I've never even thought about it or ever even tried it in the past so I'm still not 100% sure if it would be for me (I guess I feel like I need to have had a desire to making stories and worlds since I was a kid to feel qualified, though I imagine that's not true).",

                            "comment": "hi! first piece of advice is to not listen to this guy bc he doesn't know what he's talking about. For the application, based on what I've seen the most important part of it seems to be the observational section of your portfolio, so id. really recommend trying to get your figure drawing skills down and doing observational drawing as much as possible. For the creative section just try to show that you have ideas for stories and s=for the sketchbook, try to avoid copying any of the ones on youtube. They want to get an idea of **your** process through the sketchbook, and try to include a lot of observation drawings in your sketchbook. Reach out to current and accepted students to get critique and attend as many portfolio days as you can, feed back is so so so important and I wouldn't have gotten in without it. Good luck!\n\nThese 2 videos are also pretty helpful imo, but again avoid copying anyone else portfolio! you want your own voice to come across in your submission. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LrHE6zcq7I&amp;t=816s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LrHE6zcq7I&amp;t=816s) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLSP6q1Zgrw&amp;t=228s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLSP6q1Zgrw&amp;t=228s)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd juts to address the \"calarts style\" thing, that \"style\" doesn't come from calarts. You are not taught to draw in that style at calarts, you are very much encouraged to express your own unique style through your work at the school. Take a look at some of the current character animation student portfolios and that becomes pretty obvious.

Goblins in France and Sheridan in canada are some that I know of that are much more affordable, and I know there are others. There are also a lot of other animation schools in the us you could look into that are also.. expensive.. but usually give good scholarships, Otis and mica are two I can think of off the top of my head (also much much much easier to get into). Most everyone I know who applied to those 2 got pretty large scholarships :) There are also some state schools with animation programs, like San Jose State, that are also much more affordable even with out of state tuition.",

Money is just the biggest issue with that type of thing, and even with Uni's in the UK now that I think about it. Doing some research lead to me discovering that this is apparently the best animation course in the UK [https://aub.ac.uk/course/animation-production](https://aub.ac.uk/course/animation-production). From what I can tell, It's very similar to CalArts but just doesn't have as big of a reputation.  \nWas just curious if studying in the US would be best since I know it's not really my choice, but I'd really love to work on similar cartoons to the ones I mentioned. Just stuff you'll normally find on Disney XD or Cartoon Network, but I know that I'd need to move to the US for that anyway. Not sure if getting a degree in the US would aid in me achieving that goal or not.",

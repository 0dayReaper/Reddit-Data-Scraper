I am going to move out soon and the renter is looking for a well-mannered, honest, and trustworthy tenant. The space is in an apartment in Canyon Country, close to a bus stop that will take you to Cal Arts. The space itself is an open, spacious loft with a walk in closet, small office space and bedroom space. There will be an interview process so please message me for more details. Thank you!",

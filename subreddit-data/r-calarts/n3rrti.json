I'm pretty sad to know that I'll be moving away from my friends here at Manila just to study over there, which is why I'm wondering if there are any international students who are also Filipino and can possibly understand Tagalog too? It'd be pretty nice to meet some people of the same race so that I can somehow feel at home once I arrive to Cali :)",

    "postText": "I was going through portfolios of accepted students and it reallllyyyy Has me worrying about applying next year. How are some of these applicants soo talented!!! I was looking through the CalArts accepted Facebook page and look at this: https://www.facebook.com/groups/187195579019719/permalink/215121376227139/\n\nThis persons work is soooo amazing. But it has me wondering... do you have to be a professional artist to even get considered for acceptance into school at Calarts? It seems that they really only want students that are already doing professional work. Idk, what do you guys think about what cal art looks for in new applications?",

They look for strong foundations, figure drawings/drawings from life, and the ability to tell a story through artwork.\n\nThough not every portfolio is a perfect package of all of that. Jacq\u2019s Accepted sketchbook (https://youtu.be/RCA4GG_tLXY) is comparatively more empty and a bit less polished than other more popular sketchbook videos, but through her sketchbook and portfolio (which I payed $3 to download, it\u2019s in the description of the sketchbook video) she shows really great personality and ability to depict story through images. If you have a couple bucks I found it very helpful to be able to look at her portfolio.\n\nThere was also another portfolio I downloaded from Gumroad which had amazing figures, landscapes, and portrait paintings, but I felt like the creative work was a lot weaker. The only sequential image story telling piece was a three panel comic about a chef, and I wasn\u2019t really a fan of her cartoony character designs. But her other art was incredible, she had potential to grow at Calarts. \n\nA lot of people apply to Calarts multiple times, and will find work and improve while trying to get in, so a good chunk of the population at the school is older. But you definitely don\u2019t have to be a professional artist to get in! There\u2019s a good number of portfolios that I\u2019ve downloaded from Gumroad that prove that. I\u2019d say just keep working hard to improve your skills as much as you can.\n\nGood luck ^^",

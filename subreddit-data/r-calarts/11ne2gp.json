    "postText": "So, recently I got into the Music Technology program at Cal Arts, and I really like the program and curriculum. However, I've heard some less-than-stellar things about the program, and I'm also worried about the location. Santa Clarita seems pretty desolate (I spent a lot of time in NYC so I'm used to hustle and bustle), and especially without a car, it seems isolating. Is there anyone here who is in the program or graduated from it? Do you think it's worth it? Is the location bothersome? Really curious because if I go, I'm spending the next four years of my life there.",

I got rejected from NYU (Clive Davis) back in December and felt really bad, thought I wouldn't get in anywhere else etc. But just know the school isn't the end all be all. Try not to worry too much about what CalArts or any other school says! And remember that college is also about socializing etc. I hope you're doing okay",

But students who are happy there are so busy doing their thing all the time that they don\u2019t mind. It\u2019s insulated but very busy if that makes sense. I hear of happy people in music technology, but I don\u2019t know how else you can get information except visiting.",

I got an offer from McGill as well and I've been going back and forth between the two schools. McGill's location/prestige/faculty made me reconsider Cal Arts a bit, but I love the Music Tech curriculum a lot!",

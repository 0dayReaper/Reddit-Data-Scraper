As for any other parties, it\u2019s all when someone wants to party, throw some speakers and drinks in a hallway and go wild. The weird thing is making sure you\u2019re not fucking with someone\u2019s art, like in a gallery or theater.",

Parties will naturally occur, give it a couple weeks, make friends with music students and older students who are throwing off campus house parties. fine art students with studios often have kickbacks in their studios or even dj outside around back between the building entrances.",

    "postText": "hi!, im in my second year of highschool and i really want to attend calarts as an animation student. i was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to get in? like what kind of stuff to put in my portfolio, whether or not to make it online and stuff like that? and maybe what it\u2019s like being at calarts, like dorm situations and classes?. \n\nalso i would be an international student, from Australia who only speaks english, so any advice because calarts website only really explains what to do if you don\u2019t speak english.   \nnormally i would just refer to researching it but I honestly cannot find much about being an international student :/.",

            "comment": "\n[here\u2019s the international applicant requirements ](https://calarts.edu/admissions/apply/international-applicants) \n\nFor character animation, they want to see at least 15 examples of life drawing, meaning original drawings from real life instead of photographs, and no traced images. First gesture/figure drawings of (preferably) nude models with emphasis on the hands, feet and face of the subject. Second they want observational drawings of your surroundings such as people, animals, buildings and urban environments like cafes, parks, etc. that have a emphasis on contour, line, shape and color. \n\nThird, they want other creative work such as sequential image storytelling, like storyboards and comics that tell a story to the viewer. Digital creative work such as illustrations, charecter designs, concept art and some animation. There is other non digital creative work such as regular drawings, paintings, designs, and illustrations. Then there\u2019s plastic arts like sculptures and ceramics. This is all uploaded digitally. \n\nFinally they want a sketchbook filled with drawings, designs, thumbnails etc. having been drawing directly into. This is different from the drawings you submit as part of your observational work. The size and capacity is up to you, this will be mailed to the school. Then a 30 to 90 second unedited video intro about yourself uploaded digitally. \n\nI suggest you go to a figure drawing session if you have any in your area for gesture drawings and for observational work draw and sketch your surrounds like people, animals, buildings, plants etc. and do the same in your sketchbook but differently then the rest.",

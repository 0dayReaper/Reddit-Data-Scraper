Other than the usual constant figure and observation practice, what can I do to improve my chances and my application? And what art classes might help me? Thanks!",

Technical skills are important but the staff is more interested in creativity and what you have to say as an artist. Basically you want your application to stand out and make an impression. It's also very subjective and a lot of people in animation don't really know how they got accepted compared to some rejected applicants. I know people who got into animation who barely tried and their art wasn't amazing. Sorry if this sounds confusing.\n\nALSO if your animation is story based then that will probably make you stand out from other applicants. They really like story and things that are unique, yknow.\n\nDon't worry if you don't get in because the staff judges more on subjective things and not really technical skills imo. good luck!",

That being said, it's still possible. Make sure you follow the prompts given (I kinda goofed bc my first assignment didn't tell much of a story, tho it was probably my strongest piece...i guess this is sort of a given but hey. ) and always work on sharpening those technical skills!\n\nThe most important piece of advice I have for you is to apply for several summer art programs (or at least one other), so you have a backup plan in the event you don't get in, kinda like college I guess lol... I ended up going to a different art summer camp this year and I learned a ton just by being in an environment with other motivated young artists! \n\nI wish you the best of luck, though, and maybe I'll even see you there next year! :-)",

    "postText": "CalArts has been my dream school since I was 16. I'll be graduating with a Bachelors in Design &amp; Interaction from a different school this fall, but I'll love to attend a Masters program there.\n\nHowever, I'm looking at the tuition costs, and it looks like it'll be $100K+ no matter what.\n\nHow have prospects been post-graduation? I know there have been a few famous alumni come out of this school, but for the average joe, what happens? I don't want to get stuck with such insane loans and a job at Starbucks.",

It's possible to apply to a countless number of scholarships and grants to basically pay nothing and take out $0 in student loans. Although it's a hustle, it's entirely possible.",

            "comment": "Hi!! I am a fellow alumni. I was in the photography and media program. Although I can not speak for design program, finding a job comes easier for dancers, theater majors, and animation students. For me, finding a job has been very difficult coming from the art program but this is just my personal experience. I bet there are many alumni who have had better experience finding jobs after graduation than I have. I would recommend talking to alums via LinkedIn or through the CalArts opportunities page. That will be a better way of getting answers that you are looking for. I loved my experience at CalArts but after graduation is different for each alumni. Good luck and let me know if you have more questions!!",

            "comment": "As someone who just got accepted into their grad program for theatre I\u2019ve got somewhat the same concerns as you. Although I\u2019ve been given a substantial grant that\u2019s over $36k a year, it\u2019s still going to be expensive. It\u2019s something that you have to weigh with yourself, as artists finding work after school isn\u2019t guaranteed like other fields (medical etc.) So if you\u2019re willing to saddle the debt for the love of the art then so be it. ALSO don\u2019t forget that there are an infinite amount of ways to get to a destination. Grad school is great but it\u2019s never have been nor will it ever be the end all be all. Cheers, and good luck on your decision mate.",

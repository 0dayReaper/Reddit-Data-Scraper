    "postText": "Hey everyone, I\u2019m gonna be honest and get this off my chest. I want to get into character animation at calarts or any other art school. The thing is I have no experience in art. AT ALL. I\u2019m currently going into my junior year in high school. Just give it to me straight if I start learning how to draw right now, by the time I graduate (2023) will I be able to even have a chance of getting in? \n\nThanks.",

            "comment": "I think anyone who wants it badly enough can probably get in. If there was a specific thing I could boil down what gets people into calarts, its probably a strong work ethic and a consistent desire to draw.\n\nIn my estimation, you need to be drawing every day as much as you can or whenever you have the time. You need to be driven to art-making as kinda like your natural default state.When I was making my calarts portfolio, I was probably drawing at least 7+ hours a day? At Calarts, we were probably drawing 10+ hours a day during first semester and 14+ hours a day during 2nd semester. Since graduating, I tend to animate at least 12 hours a day for my jobs. That might sound scary, but animation is a production heavy and time-sensitive industry.\n\nTLDR, you need to draw as much as you are capable of, and maybe another 20% more. Do that and your chances of getting in improve significantly.",

            "comment": "If I remember correctly, character animation has a 4% acceptance rate, which is extremely low. I would recommend to start learning how to draw today via youtube. Youtube has some absolutely amazing content for beginners (and intermediate and advanced) for free. If you want to pay, there are some great courses on skillshare as well as Patreon.\n\nFrom what I've heard, CalArts really wants to see figure drawing, and see that you understand how to draw people. Practice proportions, draw figure drawings of humans as well as animals. I believe they also might want to see your artistic style and how you set yourself apart from the rest.\n\nThey don't want to see what you *think* they want to see, if that makes sense. Don't draw with the intention of \"I think CalArts would love if I drew this over what I really want to draw\". They want to see your art that you're passionate about making, and who you are through your art. Protip: Don't draw anime or cartoons in your sketchbook. \n\nVery importand: Go on Youtube and look up accepted and rejected sketchbooks, see how they differ. Look into the comments, specifically look for people's critiques on rejected sketchbooks.\n\nHope this helps a bit. Good luck!",

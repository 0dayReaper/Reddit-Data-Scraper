            "comment": "First off, congrats!! That's not an easy feat! As someone in the music department, I can say I'm pretty split on this question myself.\n\nIn terms of what makes it worth the money: the people you meet, friends you make, the teachers you learn from, getting your work critiqued, the insanely interesting classes you take, the amount of opportunities to collaborate, the paths I went down here musically that I don't think I would have if I didn't come here, and so on. \n\nIn terms of what makes it not worth the money: Well, the cost. It's insane that this school costs this much, and the scholarships they offer you (if they give you one) aren't good compared to other colleges and what they can offer. I don't think I've ever heard of anyone getting a full ride to this place. Trying to talk to the administration is (for me, at least) a nightmare as I'm constantly sent down rabbit holes of \"I'm not sure, email this person\" or simply never responded to. Some teachers don't respond to emails often as a lot of them are working artists and are busy during the time they don't teach. There's kind of the feeling here that the administration doesn't really care about the students. Example, we're having online classes right now due to coronavirus, no partial refunds. It's pretty ridiculous. I've heard many other art schools are giving partial refunds, but CalArts does not. Expect to be screwed at every turn money-wise. \n\nEven though I wrote more about the bad, I find myself putting up with it because the pros are worth it.",

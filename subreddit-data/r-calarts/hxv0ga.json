            "comment": "I know a lot of both from CalArts. Both programs are intense and highly competitive, but Character Animation is like...winning the lotto difficulty to get into.\n\nGD: Great field and flexible if you are good. A lot of friends are doing all sorts of GD but the most financially successful got into UI/UX and web design. Some are highly successful in film as well as fashion/branding. The ones who are struggling are the ones who went hard into print or who just aren't that talented.\n\nCharacter Animation: very long hours, you have to get good with both drawing and 3d animation. You will end up at Pixar/Disney if you work your ass off and have the talent, drive, and willingness to learn. It is *reportedly* not an easy career because of the hours and long slog to get to actual creative positions but it's a tight knit community and many animators are happy with their choice.",

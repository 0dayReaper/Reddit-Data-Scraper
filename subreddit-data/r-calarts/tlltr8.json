    "postText": "Hey there! I'm u/hazardous1319 and I applied to the Experimental Animation program with high hopes. Unfortunately, as the letters came out an hour ago, I was rejected. I was wondering if there was any kind of appeal process known by CalArts to reconsider applications. The program means more to me than I can express in words, and I'll be happy to receive any feedback or advice I can get.\n\nThanks!",

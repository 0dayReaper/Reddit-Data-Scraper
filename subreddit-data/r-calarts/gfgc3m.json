    "postText": "Hey! I dropped out of med school to pursue a career in animation. I only doodled and sketched pretty rarely before this, but I would say I was not that good at it. However, Ive been seriously  drawing for 7 months now. I would love some critique and feedback on what to improve!! Thanks in advance!  \n\nLink: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-3JKUxcd12vOb4Zb9nNjxVXeSAbnFPdr",

            "comment": "Not an animation student, was a theatre student who originally got a \"soft admission\" as a visual artist. Went to CalArts with some of the mid-80s legends so I got to be a bit of a fly on the wall, including looking at portfolios.\n\nYou're definitely talented, and nobody's looking for a polished shovel-ready animator, but here's what I'd say:\n\n1. You have med school experience - if that means you can break down the body and engineer the bones and muscle and other components of your characters that is key. A big thing animators try to avoid are \"soft spots\" where they just don't understand what the hell is going on in the body of their characters. Russ Edmonds, who later went to Disney, was an engineer and was great at helping folks understand the structure within the characters.\n\n2. Character design - I'd work on that. Why do you want to be an animator? What styles do you gravitate toward? Do you have a point of view? Lots of anime stuff more recently, but in my day it was more Disneyesque stuff with some Jay Ward stuff. It's good to have art, still life, life drawing to show your chops, but how does it translate to animation.\n\n3. Expression - how can you show the emotional spectrum of your characters? Explore with lines and economy, do some more produced/constructed drawings as well. They want to know how you think and react.\n\n4. Movement - fundamental understanding the physics of animation. Show more of it.\n\n5. Tell a story with your work. Tension, personality, drama, desire - make it visceral and engaging. \n\nIn general I'd say keep going and take it further. Latch onto why you want to be in animation, who your heroes are, what excites you and how you can take what is ... and add to it. Animation is a unique world and those who want to be a part of it are committed to the craft and to one another. Because you'll be part of some high-pressure, close-knit teams, the ability to marry character, story, style and movement in the physical world is key.\n\nYou've got a lot of potential. Keep going and always drive forward without editing. You'll find your voice and your little masterpieces in motion.\n\nGood luck.",

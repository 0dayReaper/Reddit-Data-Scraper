    "postText": "ok so im an international student accepted onto a grad programme at cal arts. I'm really stressed out. I want to study there so badly but I think I thought that more scholarship would be available for me (as someone with the need for it). I feel stupid, I asked a while a go if I could defer my place and then have a year to apply for more scholarships (I missed the deadline for fullbright) but that's not possible.  I am anxiously waiting for my financial awards letter but i get the impression that the max merit scholarship they will offer me would be 10k and thats still not enough, even though thats the max. I feel so sad and disheartened.",

            "comment": "hug hug. i think your mental health is more important than the scholarship. i know it's a tough time. But I've heard of someone e-mailing faculty for more scholarships (her major is film, and sometimes the amount depends on the budget of each major) last year. And she got it. Maybe you can e-mail them again, maybe there's a chance. hope you could feel better.\nBtw. There are other types of scholarships you can apply for besides the one you're talking about( https://calarts.edu/tuition-and-financial-aid/financial-aid/for-graduate-students/scholarships-for-graduate-students)and maybe the total will make you feel a little less anxious!",

            "comment": "Hi! I\u2019m in the same boat as you except I\u2019m from the US. I got into the grad film/video program. They offered me 20k/year and some work study. But yeah, this is still not nearly enough. I\u2019m in the process of appealing my financial aid through their financial aid office. Basically making an appeal that I need more \u201cneed-based\u201d aid. I highly suggest doing that as well!\n\nHave you applied anywhere else? I\u2019m considering my other options, some of which have full tuition coverage. They may not hold the same name value, but they can be just as good. It\u2019s pretty difficult to have finances get in the way of a dream so I definitely sympathize. But from everything I\u2019ve been reading, art school debt is awful and the worst thing outside of impacting your lifestyle is how it may hurt your ability to make art at all.",

    "postText": "I just recently decided that I would apply for EA rather than CA because it\u2019s more my style and I do not have everything required to apply for CA. Upon looking at the portfolio requirements for EA I have an idea of what I need, but it\u2019s not really clear as to how I should put these files together. A demo reel for the videos? A pdf for drawn stuff? Or do I put everything on it\u2019s own? \n\nAlso my animation teacher has not submitted his rec letter what do I do about that (school starts on the 9th)",

            "comment": "I am also applying to EA and I understand your confusion. For my portfolio, I'm not combining anything. I'm including 2-3 short animations and a demo reel from 2020-21, along with other drawings/sculptures. I think that uploading each of these separately into separate \"slides\" would be easiest for the admissions staff to view. That's what I'm doing, at least. \n\nAs for the letter of recs, I've only received one from my counselor and the teacher hasn't submitted hers yet. School starts on the 9th for me too. Someone on here (r/calarts) said that the recommenders can submit their letters after the deadline, and I tried finding out if the website says that too but it doesn't seem to be on there. If it gives you any sort of relief, when I go the \"review\" section of the application, it doesn't say anywhere that \"a letter of rec is missing...\", so that makes it seem like they don't require the letters to be submitted when you submit the application. \n\nI hope this helps, even a little!",

    "postText": "I have been really interested in Calarts for a while now I wanted to apply there next year, and  I wanted to apply to their character animation program, but after having a talk with my parents about finance and reaserching about their scholarships and collage fee I decided maybe it won't be a good idea. My problem is that there is still a part of me that wants to apply but even if I do the only chance for me to go there is to get a 100% or 80% scholarship and from what I know it is muchhh harder to get when you are an international student. What should I do??",

            "comment": "hey, that\u2019s okay! some dreams are harder to let go than others. but it\u2019s just exactly that: a dream. and a rose-tinted one at that. especially as an international (which I am too, and like the ACTUAL far away internationals not the ones that are just right near the border of the US\u2026 let me tell you, girl was delusional in thinking she could ever pay off a \u201ccalarts debt\u201d \ud83d\ude2dinternationals will not get a scholarship for the ca program, trust.) for reference, i applied this year to CA and got waitlisted and during the start of my application process, i started to realise that my attachment to Calarts  wasnt because of the school itself but the IDEA of it (funny, right?)the good thing is that noawadays, calarts isnt the only place to get that from anymore! Industry professionals can be found working as professors in many other artschools now, and a creative/passionate environment isnt solely limited to Calarts. So apply if you want (i did for funsies and yk to fulfill a longlife dream of applying) but ask yourself: what is it that you actually LIKE about the school? and dont ONLY say student films; those were made by already skilled people, some who really care and love their craft. and is your goal in your career really to peak during your college years and only make amazing student films that get into festivals most job recruiters wont even scoff at? really do. your. research. forget everything you thought you knew about the school and look into it again as if you had never heard of it in your life before. Look at RECENT, graduating alumni and find out where they are! look into the syllabus and see if the classes are what you like; kindly ask other international students there about their financial sitch and also state/culture of living yada yada yada\u2026 it\u2019s like an investment. And you have to make sure the return is higher than the cost. Not everyone has to have debt after college. Please dont believe that. Other affordable schools near the industry (and therefore have access to industry events and networking opportunities) include schools like LCAD and SJSU and others im sure a little googling will reveal. Point is: Calarts is not the end all be all for aspiring animators anymore. you are much worthy than what a school will lead you to believe. you got this op!! im rooting for you!",

I live in Spain right now and honestly I would love to stay here with my family and continue my studies here aswell, I'm just worried that if I don't go to a school that isn't very high profile or if I don't go to a school in the US, I'm afraid that I won't be able to break into the industry or find a good or stable job in the end. Thank you so much again!",

I got really drunk during pre-party and ended up throwing up in a friend's toilet in her room, and still went to the party and just had a really epic night overall haha\n\nAlso, 2012 Halloween Party had the BEST SET DESIGN I've ever seen when I was a student there, also that's when I tried Maly for the first time lol",

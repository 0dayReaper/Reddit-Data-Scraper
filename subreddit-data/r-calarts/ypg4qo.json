The faculty for performer composer are fantastic, really unique individuals which are unlike any other faculty I've ever come across. If you are unsure about them, its not worth it. It is majority an undergrad school. A lot of masters graduates from CalArts feel like they got ripped off because you will be put in many required classes with undergrads, and not enough time with your mentor. What other schools wont have is the incredible experimental music, world music, production technology departments and faculty. The experience is really what you make of it though.",

They\u2019re mainly looking for good fundamentals and life drawing, any animation that you add is extra. If you think it\u2019s some of your best work then you should include it, but it\u2019s not the most important part.",

Cause if you do get in, they\u2019ll instruct you better. However, if you don\u2019t feel like there good quality, don\u2019t submit them, you want to give them your best work.",

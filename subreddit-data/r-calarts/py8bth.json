It seems that CalArts cares more about your artwork/portfolio verses your academic grades. So I'd say no, it doesn't matter, as long as your art is good.",

I think a lot of it is just averages, and they're going off of averages to infer what you *should* have, which is wrong. Don't worry about GPA, SAT, or ACT, as long as your artwork/portfolio is good.\n\nMost important information you need: an absolutely **great** portfolio, an absolutely **great** essay, letters of recommendation, and all the other info they ask you for. You don't have to submit SAT or ACT scores, but you have to submit your highschool/college transcripts. I'd highly recommend letting a second pair of eyes go over your essay/artist statement and critique it.\n\nIf you're looking to get into character animation, look at rejected sketchobooks verses accepted sketchbooks and see what the differences are. There are usually great critique in the comments (wade through the rejected sketchbook's \"this is so good\" comments and you'll find good criticism).",

    "postText": "I think I worded the title too poorly, so let me explain. I'm currently a senior in highschool and want to attend CalArts and there are 2 deadlines, 1 in Dec. 1 and another in Jan. 4. Is there a difference in the 2 deadlines besides the cost, like, for example, how NYU has different deadlines and you're more likely to get accepted if you submit it by the earlier deadline.",

They would rather you spend more time preparing your portfolio than worrying about the early deadline. I\u2019ve known a lot of people meet the early deadline then not get in. CalArts is one of the last schools to notify students of acceptance too so applying early makes the wait even longer. You will not get notified early by applying early I can assure you of that. Be prepared to play the waiting game with CalArts.",

But I'd listen to this person. It also may be program specific. I'd definitely hold off on accepting until you know what their plan for next fall is though. $50k for zoom classes is absurd.",

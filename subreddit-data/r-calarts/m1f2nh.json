            "comment": "hi!!! i just got accepted for the photography and media program :). some advice i have for you is to add works from your past because it shows improvement and variety. you\u2019ll be able to put a caption for each piece. i also wouldn\u2019t about the dimensions for each piece, i wrote down random numbers and still got accepted. also add some graphics that include some photographs, it helped me because it showed i\u2019m not limited to solely photography but also graphic design. you\u2019re going to have to write an artist statement and i was very honest and raw in mine, don\u2019t hold back on what you have to say. lastly, i took 2 1/2 years of audio video production, 3 years of AP art, and 1 year of graphic design and that helped me a whole lot with my transcripts. the more visual art classes, the better.",

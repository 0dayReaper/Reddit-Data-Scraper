    "postText": "I found out about Calarts late November but was still trying to figure out all I needed to apply and being lazy(being home all day with no license is draining). \n\nI'm aiming at the Character Animation program, but I'm aiming to get in for fall 2015(although waiting for 2016 wouldn't be too bad).\n\n I've gotten all the stuff I need to fill up a sketchbook and make a diverse portfolio, I just don't know how late I can actually send in all this stuff application, I know January 5th is a deadline but on the site it said they'll take applications until programs close but they don't really say when that is.  I just read about one person  didn't find out they'd be attending until July, so would I be like an extra to fill in spots sitting on a waitlist for a period of time?",

Bring your book with you and talk to people on the campus. Don't be disappointed if you don't get in straightaway. I know at least one animation legend who didn't get in the first year and was waitlisted the second.\n\nGood luck. Go to Santa Clarita! :)",

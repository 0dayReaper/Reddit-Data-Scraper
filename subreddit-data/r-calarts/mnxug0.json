Is the more discreet location worth it to attend school there? Looking for a perspective from character animation majors specifically, but I\u2019d love to hear from anyone attending!",

I\u2019d say if you don\u2019t have a car and don\u2019t plan to use public transportation, it can maybe feel a little disconnected. But if you have a car or commit to utilizing pubic transportation, you are a SHORT drive from Los Angeles. I\u2019ve lived in Valencia for my entire life thus far and I commute to Orange County for occasional work AND commute to Los Angeles for acting classes and even dining! So it\u2019s totally doable and EASY! There is a lot going on in the Valencia area, depending on your interests. But you\u2019re also a short drive away from LA! Valencia itself is a quiet place. No clubs and not a ton of hot spots or night life for young people, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re into. There are some decent spots to eat. But it\u2019s definitely the suburbs. I love going rock climbing, figure skating, hiking, and grabbing some vegan food! But I also go out into the city of Los Angeles A LOT for better food or a theatre show or a concert or if I\u2019m looking to go out for a night (which for me is basically never hahaha).",

            "comment": "Honestly is very boring.. LA really isn't too far if you can drive/have a car. But what I usually did for fun if I couldn't spend time in LA was to get food and hang with friends at our places or on campus, not much to do around besides that tbh. There are some good places to hike nearby, surprisingly lots of good boba places, some decent places to eat if you know where, and six flags? once it opens. But from experience, I usually get really busy once the school year starts to do much stuff all the time, and if I actually get that time I would rather spend it going to get good food or do better things in the LA area.",

However as an LA native and someone who partially grew up in Santa Clarita when I was very young, I can tell you with no hesitation that it *sucks*. Outside of calarts it\u2019s really all cookie cutter condo housing and a lot of conservative bros. Not trying to dissuade you at all! That\u2019s just basically the truth. It\u2019s really not far at all from LA though and there are tons and tons things to do there. I\u2019m going to commute from my place in eagle rock and it\u2019s about a 35/40 minute drive.",

Campus life is fine if you\u2019re a grad student, but probably isn\u2019t as glamorous/exciting for your undergrad experience. Most of your classmates will be commuters so the disconnect will be from that angle.",

Most of your fun revolves around hanging out with friends in the dorm or parties at someone's apartment.  Generally, undergrads are too broke to pay to do much else, plus they are too busy with school work.  I think a lot of the character animation majors socialize late at night in the computer labs.",

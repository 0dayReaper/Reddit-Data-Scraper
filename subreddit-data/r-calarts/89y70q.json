    "postText": "I recently heard about CalArts and their music programs. The only problem is I can't seem to find the information I want to know about them. \nI'm a saxophonist who has had 6 years of music theory training and 4 years of private tutoring and self-taught jazz and improv. (10 years collectively)\nI want to know which would fit me best. The performance/composer program seems inviting, but because I don't know exactly that would do I'm still on the fence about it. I'm really interested in the Jazz program, but I don't know if that means that I will be repeating what I already know or I will learn something new. \n\nThanks in advance",

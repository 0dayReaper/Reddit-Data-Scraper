    "postText": "This is probably a common question on this page I imagine, so sorry if this is repetitive! \nI was wondering, people who got into Cal arts, what advice can you give to us who are applying when it comes to portfolio and sketchbook?\n\nI\u2019ve barely started my sketch book but it\u2019s been a big cause of stress for me. I\u2019m mostly a digital artist it\u2019s very intimidating for me. I\u2019m also not very good at backgrounds (though I am practicing) and I also can\u2019t go out and to life drawings because of COVID. I\u2019m also worried about the type of sketchbook, mediums, messing up, ect.\n\nAny advice you can give would be greatly appreciated! Thank you \u2764\ufe0f and stay safe!\n\nEdit: Forgot to put that I want to get into character animation!!",

There are online resources like New Masters Academy on YouTube and such that gives free resources for figure drawings. You can also draw your family members since that counts as a life drawing! Try your best not to look at references for the sketchbook online because you may end up unconsciously copying the style instead of staying true to yourself. For the sketchbook I know some people that got it with completely black and white ones so I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about it! Your portfolio should be your main focus. Demonstrate your technical skills and show a bit of ur personality!! Good luck with applying ! \n\n(delete if not allowed) I made a YT vid explaining my portfolio and app process if you want to check it out: https://youtu.be/UpwmWiGVsUI",

            "comment": "I'm in the same position as you are, being a digital artist makes it really tough to get started on a huge book of traditional art. I don't think I can give good advice, but I want to assure you that you are not alone in this position. In fact, I was relieved to see someone else with the same worries as me!\n\nFor backgrounds (especially traditional) I think you should work on building your foundation and work on perspective. You could even copy from photos (although Calarts recommends against using other people's photos, and if you use your own try to warp it or modify it, don't just draw it as it is). Remember, always attempt to show your skills in storytelling. \n\nWhen it comes to the traditional medium, the biggest thing to work on (that I think is the biggest struggle for me) is not being able to get rid of mistakes. When you're a digital artist it becomes so easy to get used to undoing every misclick. Getting intimidated by the blank pages is also something I assume you are dealing with. I recommend practicing and experimenting on pages besides your sketchbook. Try to find a medium that is the closest to how you draw digitally.\n\nAnother thing is watching Calarts sketchbook videos and getting intimidated and/or discouraged. I think I need to tell myself this just as much, but whether or not you get into Calarts or not doesn't decide whether your art is valuable or not. Keep drawing, keep improving, and don't let your nerves hold you back from giving it your best shot, especially when the worst case scenario is you get rejected. If you truly love art, you'll find another path to continue doing what you love, promise. \n\nI don't mean to get so personal, but I hope you have a great day, random internet person. Good luck with your portfolio! I'm sure you'll do great!",

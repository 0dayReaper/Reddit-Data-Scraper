    "postText": "Hi! So I\u2019m a 2020 BFA painting graduate from India, but I\u2019ve always been interested in illustration and character design. (It\u2019s my dream to work at Disney one day) I\u2019m currently working as a trainee Character designer at this one commercial studio, that produces work for TV/ Cinema, but I want to get a Masters soon, hopefully 2022 Fall is when I want to start. I\u2019ve been doing a lot of research about Animation schools in the US for quite some time now and CalArts has been one of the schools I\u2019ve wanted to apply to. I really like their Character Animation program but they don\u2019t offer an MFA in that, just a BFA and I would prefer not to do another BFA since I already have one, albeit in a different subject. There is an MFA available however, in the Experimental Animation program. I wanted to know if that was more geared towards being a contemporary art practice, than something a studio would hire from? I\u2019m really confused and I\u2019ve been reaching out to as many alumni as possible but I just want to be sure.",

It\u2019s intensive and stressful but it\u2019s what I love, however it\u2019s more geared towards the 3D animation part of the pipeline but it\u2019s pretty customisable as you can take electives from other majors such as Sequential Art and Illustration. It\u2019s been really good so far and the Professors are incredible. Only that SCAD is really expensive as a school and there\u2019s only so much aid you can get as an international student and most people are drowning in student loans by the time they finish. However, scad has a huge alumni network and the connections they have are incredible and they provide all the help they can to help you succeed, but you do need to put in your own effort. I hope you get your situation sorted out, good luck!",

    "postText": "Hello there! \n\nI\u2019m a perspective student for the Character Animation program and I\u2019ll be applying soon for the Portfolio Prep class. \n\nI had a view questions about the application process for the course. If  anyone can answer, I\u2019d love to hear from you! \n\n1.) For the life drawings, does the medium by which I do them matter? I am not a great painter so most of my traditional art is sketching or linking. \n\n2.) Does it matter what I choose to draw from life? (Lol I don\u2019t know how else to ask that, sounds silly) I was thinking of doing an observational drawing downtown with a lot of scenery and a long form pose of my partner. Thoughts? \n\nAny other tips are appreciated! Thank you!",

Also yeah environments, people, quick gesture drawings of people are something they are looking at. Studies of life aren\u2019t that concrete on what they want so you don\u2019t have to stress about it too much. They just want to see how quick and how good you are at looking at something and putting it on a page :)",

    "postText": "Hello everyone, I am looking to transfer out of my current university to pursue character animation. I was looking through the requirements for application, and saw that a link to my socials is asked for. Now, I really only use one social media account (that being instagram), but I hardly use it for posting my art. How relevant to the admissions is this? \n\nAlso, to anyone currently in the program, I was just curious how the work culture is there. I\u2019m studying Architecture at Cornell so I\u2019m quite use to very long hours spent at studio, but I\u2019m just curious.\n\nThanks to anyone that replies :)",

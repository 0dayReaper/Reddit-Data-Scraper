Definitely before the orientation week (3rd-11th), and I doubt it'll be before August 26th. \nSo, sometime between August 26th and September 2nd (most likely closer to the 2nd) based off of what happened last year. \n\nHere's a link to the academic calendar if you don't have it already :0 https://calarts.edu/academics/academic-calendar/2022-2023",

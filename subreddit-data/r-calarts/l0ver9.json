    "postText": "So I am currently in the 8th grade (ehehe yeah I know this may be a little early) and I really want to go into the Calarts Character Animation Program when I graduate highschool. Which is in a couple of years but I really want to get in, So I would like to know what I should be practicing in my art. Just for an idea I graduate in about 4 years and I want to make the most of them so I can get into CalArts. As for the reasoning I want in, well I really would like to make my own animated show! I just love to make up my own character's and give them stories! Not only that but I just feel like going to a school with so many creative people would be an amazing experience! If you have any tips for what I should be practicing that would be greatly appreciated! I will link some of my art below for reference. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso does taking creative classes in Highschool raise my chances of getting accepted?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks :D\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y3ascm6mbdc61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=de3e5b3b76fe57ed0c28fe3c4bc52ea9ee17c5c2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jqhcioalbdc61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d5d56e3f085104e609cf73bc1f9b1ebcdd8ce730\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zh1sg2wibdc61.png?width=925&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=79118efab7ef9e833bd18ddfcdba80b16e2e9f6b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6vcsyldibdc61.png?width=1217&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=396c93e846222d528aecf8fb30319283e577de3b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rg7kde9bbdc61.png?width=1027&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fd62a85bfda85e1787d6fc76c8d2df69e5bda7ca",

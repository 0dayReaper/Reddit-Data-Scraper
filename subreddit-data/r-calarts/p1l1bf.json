    "postText": "I\u2019m really interested in attending CalArts to study costume design, but in all honesty I\u2019m not a fantastic artist outside of drawing clothing and figures.  I\u2019m planning on taking intensive drawing lessons to try and gain some skill, but I\u2019m worried that my portfolio won\u2019t be strong enough. Do I really have a shot at getting in? And is the theatre, specifically the design program, have as much competition as say animation or music might?",

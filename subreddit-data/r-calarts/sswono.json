I am very stressed. What did people do in the past for this assignment?\n\nmy idea was to do something about how when you won a dog you constantly think about how you will use the limited time you have. My dog died recently so I thought it would be a cool topic to explore. however I have already done many pieces relating to dogs. I cannot think of anything that could possibly work with it. Maybe drawing dogs isn't a problem if you diversify the breeds an body types.\n\nmy idea was to do something about how when you won a dog you constantly think about how you will use the limited time you have.

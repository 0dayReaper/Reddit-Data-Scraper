    "postText": "Hello, I am currently working on a documentary about the importance of funding art programs and nurturing creativity in our communities. I am searching for a student to be a part of the doc as a subject. I would follow along on your first day of school and then check in with you every 2 months for 9 months total. If you are a student who will be attending this fall semester, please DM me.",

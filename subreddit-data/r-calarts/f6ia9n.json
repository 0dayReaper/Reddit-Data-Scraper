    "postText": "So I applied to the Character Animation program back in January, and about a week ago I received an email from the financial aid department, containing a number labeled \u201cStudent ID\u201d, saying that there\u2019s a missing document that they need from me, and to login to the Student Portal Hub thing to look at the financial aid checklist to see exactly what I\u2019m missing, and that I would be receiving a second email from the admissions office containing my login information. I still have not received that email, so earlier today I called the financial aid office and explained the situation. They went ahead and told me what document I was missing, and also said that I should be receiving the hub login information email from admissions within a day or so, and that\u2019s where I am now. I have not received an acceptance letter and as far as I know they won\u2019t be sent out until around March, but the way they\u2019re talking really makes it seem like I\u2019ve already been accepted. I\u2019m trying not to get my hopes up in case it\u2019s a misunderstanding, but I really don\u2019t know what else this could all mean.",

I am sharing some info directly from CalArts Admissions for the group's benefit. \n\n I called the admissions office this afternoon and asked what the notice / access to the Hub was about, since our checklist was complete.  The first words out of the admission's representative's mouth were:\n\n \"This isn't a notice of acceptance.  The Hub access is the next stage of the application process to allow applicants to identify what's missing on their checklist.  Acceptance decisions are going out (by e-mail and U.S. Mail) starting in March, through early April.\"\n\nShe didn't indicate whether Hub access was offered out to every single applicant or a smaller number.  My impression is that she was trying to say that Hub access was routine and should not be raising hopes.",

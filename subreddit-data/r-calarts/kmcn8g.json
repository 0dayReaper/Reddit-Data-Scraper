    "postText": "Hey all! I have two questions, if you could, please answer:\n\n1. One of my recommenders is a private art teacher, meaning that he does not have an affiliation with an organization. The form says the organization of the recommender is required. Is it okay if I just type on none or N/A?\n\n2. Im sending the application from a country where recommendations are not a usual thing. One of my recommenders, not knowing, did not put a letterhead or anything like that. She just typed the recommendation into a word file, finished it with her credentials and sent it in. So the form might look unofficial, is that okay?\n\nI want to do everything correctly, am I looking too much into this? Thank you in advance!",

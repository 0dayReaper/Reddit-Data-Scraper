People's bodies twist and bend in predictable ways, so if you 'get' those ways, you can sorta quickly throw them onto paper in a way that looks right.\n\nYou follow the rules of gravity, adding weight to your drawings as you go (it'll help to do fabric/clothing studies, movement studies, and 5-10 minute figure drawings for this).\n\nYou try to capture movement. Trying to draw bodies as a single line, or doing 5 second figure studies, will help with this.\n\nYou capture proportions rather than details. For this, I've found no better way to learn than to simply measure, with your thumb or pencil, the size/distance/relative proportions of various objects, and see where your proportions are off. Mirroring your canvas, either in Photoshop or with an actual mirror, will help you see flaws in proportions as well. Oh, and lots of architecture studies.\n\nYou add in values (shadows/light), and color, where appropriate. (Still-lives will help with doing this, or drawing from nature.)\n\nAnd you focus on communicating an idea clearly, i.e.: 'person reading', 'lion roaring'.\n\nHonestly, the boring answer is just 'practice a lot'.\n\nBut even more honestly, you have to fake it. You fake movement by drawing in a certain way, making your pencil light or skewed or heavy. You fake gravity by thickening some parts of the drawing, by making folds, by keeping in mind which foot somebody would lean on. You stretch and compress. You make blobs that look like people, by drawing lots and lots of humans in more detail, and trying to learn about what makes them look like humans instead of blobs.\n\nDrawing is just making blobs and shapes sorta look like stuff. That's it. You draw the gist of it, and let your viewer fill in the rest.",

You still gotta practice figures and still-lives, but if you like dragons, then draw lizards, or if you like color, then draw models with fun clothing. It takes a long time to learn how to draw well, and it's best if you are not bored to death while practicing. Pick things that you like.",

    "postText": "Curious if anybody has some food for thought, but was CAlArTS cheaper back in the day to attend? So many popular Disney directors or animators went there, and I know a few of them came from humble beginnings. Because like- one cannot simply attend CAlArTS with  humble beginnings unless offered a killer scholarship. \n\nI know a few others didn\u2019t do well academically, so they might not have been eligible for scholarships but did well enough on their portfolios to get admitted anyway\u2014 so what was their financial situation? Because if mom and dad weren\u2019t ranking in hella cash given the titiatuon at CAlArTS nowadays then it\u2019s either that or it was cheaper to attend back then.",

People I know who went to school there from the 1990\u2019s til now all mention the high prices when discussing CalArts. \n\nI am a current student, with professional experience of 13+ years in my industry and I get about a 25% scholarship. I have never heard of anyone getting more than that from the Institute.",

I was told that was the maximum scholarship I could attain. Forced my way through the gates and got my degree in 1.5 years there. It is outrageously expensive. Took a free ride elsewhere for post grad with a stipend because even w my scholarship I would have paid 70k for a graduate degree",

    "postText": "I took a Leave of Absence last year due to me coming down to the opinion that CalArts just wasn't worth the price of tuition when compared to Fall 2019. I was there for Spring 2020 when the transition to online classes happened and didn't want to spend my last year doing online classes. IMO the quality of the classes, especially world music classes, were just destroyed. I'm not sure how Fall 2020 turned out as I was not tuned in at all.\n\nThis semester, half my classes are online and half are in-person. I'm signed up for some very interesting classes but there are a whole lot of classes that aren't available from Fall 2019. I had a list of classes I wanted to take when I got back and 8/10 of them were not available due to them not being taught. Not sure if this is a normal thing or not but I'm still bummed regardless.\n\nHonestly I'm still deciding if I'm going to go back or not. I don't know if other specializations/majors are hit as hard as the music department (or at least that's how I'm perceiving it), what do you think?",

Also heard some stuff about people in the character animation department being moved to a mall nearby for classes since there was some flooding back in April? Seems like with that in mind, and the fact that a lot of classes are online or hybrid, campus will be a lot more empty than usual\u2026\n\nI\u2019m also super paranoid that with rising Covid cases, things will end up getting shut down. I\u2019m no way in hell spending this much money to go through Zoom hell.",

Practically destroyed the world music department and killed interaction in general. The only reason I'd go back is to finish my last year so I can get my degree, and it's pretty tempting just to be done with it at this point.\n\nDidn't hear about character animation being moved to a mall, that's... interesting lol",

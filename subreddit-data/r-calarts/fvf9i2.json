I've seen rejectees with better anatomy and proportion than many of the acceptees and have always caught a different vibe with the accepted submissions. I am very much afraid of being rejected so I need to know what is it that it actually takes to get accepted into this program. I'm willing to do anything.",

            "comment": "There are factors other than sketchbooks when it comes to Calarts admissions. The portfolio is a big one, and also essays, letters of rec, gpa (tho not as important as others), etc. With that said, what Calarts really looks for in their character animation applicant is a strong artistic voice. What may seem like laking in anatomy might just be their stylization of the body. Calarts wants the applicant who of course has a good fundementals, but also has a unique perspective and style, which can translate into a one-of-a-kind narrative for a film. \n\nWhen I was caught up with the idea of putting together a sketchbook that consists of \"what Calarts would like to see,\" I got rejected. Then I just started to draw whatever came to my mind and whatever was around me, with a little personal twists. It was much more fun to do that way, and I was actually enjoying the process-which showed in my sketchbook. This time, I got in. So I'd recommend stop thinking about drawing for THEM. Make a sketchbook for YOU. Let your own personality speak through. That'll make your portfolio and sketchbook much more stronger. Good luck!",

I drew inspiration from artists, films, and other works that were influential to me rather than those applicants whose work I liked, but really mostly admired *because* they were accepted. \n\nTry to have fun, take your time, and spent some time looking inwards than outwards(wc?). Make a collage of artists, subjects, hobbies, interests, things you like, etc that you can keep referring back to when you get lost. Print it out and stick it somewhere. Eventually all this \"draw for yourself\" stuff will click and what seemed like super vague nothing advice will actually start to make sense... Or that was my experience at least. \n\nAlso do lots of blind contour and continuous line drawings. It's helps improve your drawing skills and they like to see those.",

You can watch those vids if you want, by all means! But what the other commentors and I are saying is that you don't have to be too attached to them. Let them be inspiration, not restriction. If you see what you like in those accepted sketchbooks, you can try it out in your own. But if you don't like some of the stuff in there, you don't have to put those in yours just bc it's from \"accepted sketchbook.\"\n\nBut as the comment above suggested, draw your inspiration and motivation from professional artists and masters. That way you're aiming higher and giving yourself some distance from those accepted sketchbook vids, which is not a bad thing to do.",

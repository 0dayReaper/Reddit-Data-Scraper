    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI have a question!! Well I\u2019d like to apply to the Character Animation program bc it\u2019s my dream and it\u2019s too perfect. The problem here is that in my country they only grant scholarships for graduate masters programs. And I know that in CalArts the only animation master is Experimental Animation.\n\nI quick read the experimental animation program and application requirements but honestly I didn\u2019t understand anything \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd2d although some artists that studied there told me that the experimental and character animation programs are pretty similar and that I can take all the same classes as character?\n\nBut well I don\u2019t know... is it true? What is the difference between programs? Is it worth it to go to experimental? Or better try to pay the character program? And some advice for the experimental application? \n\nThank you so much guys I\u2019ll really appreciate it! /for some context I want to work as a story artist and become a showrunner/ and I\u2019m finishing my BFA this year here in my home city.\n\nThis is my ig page: @theerikasalazar (so you may see my art level and style)",

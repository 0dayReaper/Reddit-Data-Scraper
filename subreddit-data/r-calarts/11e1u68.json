    "postText": "I'm planning to apply to calarts for 2024 and I have a huge question about the requirements to apply regarding high school rank/score. I'm from Australia and when we finish high school we have to complete HSC (final exams) and some people choose to get a rank (ATAR) and  you can only get into universities/colleges if you have an atar rank (I think the equivalent is SAT/ACT/GRE in America). I want to apply for the character animation BFA program at calarts and I was wondering if you need to have to have a high school rank to apply for this program since I'm pretty sure you have to finish grade 12 as one of the requirements but just wasn't sure if it was compulsory to have a rank since you can choose if you want to go for one here and I'm sure it's a similar system in the US.\n\nIf anyone knows that'd be great :)",

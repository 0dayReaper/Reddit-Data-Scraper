Look at what the professors are doing and see what projects they\u2019ve been involved with.\n\nAfter that, CalArts wants fresh minds and potential, so you\u2019re most important first foot in the door will be a portfolio. Depending on what you\u2019re applying to, use things that are strong (usually the most recent things you\u2019ve made or accomplished).\n\nThis means that you should take a year of proper planning, keeping in communication with the advisors, and show you\u2019re willing to learn. And don\u2019t spring your contacts that you need their reference by the end of next week.",

By my third and final year I was at about 70 percent covered by scholarship. \nDon\u2019t be disappointed if the first semester it\u2019s below 50 percent. \nOnce they see your work it will most likely go up. \nThe only exception I\u2019ve seen is where people didn\u2019t produce any art or very little art that year. Try to have something to showcase by the end of each school year. \n\nEnjoy your time at cal arts! It\u2019s short so make the most of it!",

Realize though, that \u201cstrength\u201d can be totally biased based on the style or social issues that the deciding committee values.\nHowever , if your work is exceptional you\u2019re going to get more money for sure.\n\nIf I recall correctly, there were 2 girls in my program that got a full scholarship the first year.\nThey were working on film that was connected to women\u2019s rights. The next few got 70 percent \nThen 50 but most freshman got around 20 percent of tuition covered.\n\nDon\u2019t worry though because they do notice hard work. Also, you will inevitably make friends (it\u2019s a small class size) with teachers and other students. When your work is good or shows a lot of thought and effort word gets around. \nThe people who choose your scholarship money are kind of your peers. It\u2019s teachers you know and and staff that will get to know you.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot that plays in your favor.\nFor example, the vice principal was really supportive when I decided to take a year off to work on my thesis film. I was still able to come to school and use all the equipment and drop in on classes without paying any tuition. They want you to make great work and succeed. \nThere are limits to what they can do for you of course. In the end it\u2019s up to the student to make take up the challenges.",

CalArts has a strong focus on global and cultural issues. International students are often prioritized especially since the faculty assumes Americans have so many opportunities and the most important artwork today often comes from countries that have been overlooked by Hollywood. For example, 10 years ago they were seeking Korean and African filmmakers to get better perspective on social issues. Two of my classmates didn\u2019t speak English so we would try to help them communicate in school. Their films were paid for and promoted.",

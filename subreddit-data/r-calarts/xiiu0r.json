Do I have to do the science and math and English thingy before attending the school?\n3. Is it a good school to attend after graduation? (Will I be accepted?)\n4. What are the talent requirements? And what should I demonstrate in my portfolio? \n5. What\u2019s the on campus living like? \nThat\u2019s all I can think of but if anyone has any tips or resources to help me understand how to apply to this school without the stress I\u2019d really appreciate it. \n\ud83d\uded0\ud83d\uded0",

CalArts takes its time with fixes issues such as sewage coming out of the shower and sinks. I know someone who\u2019s apartment did that six separate times and it took the sixth time for calarts to think about re-housing them to a local hotel while maintenance attempted to fix the problem. \n\n\u2026.the problem was in fact never fixed. \n\nYou can always stay on campus late to connect with people but have a home that doesn\u2019t throw sewage at you.",

Again, u don't have to, but if u do come in with some college gen ed credits, they're gonna transfer and ur workload would be lessened and u could possibly graduate early, depending on ur major.\n\n3. When u say graduation, do u mean hs or college?? Either way, I've seen ppl from both cases and they were doing fine.\n\n4. The \"talent\" requirement and portfolio material depend on which school and major u would like to apply. Start by going to an admissions page on Calarts website and see what each major requires u to put in ur portfolio.\n\n5. On campus living is fine, but u have to keep in mind the buildings are pretty old and do have a lot of problems that come with the age. But the experience itself isn't so bad, esp if ur living with ur friends. Also off campus housing might be cheaper on a long term.. Sth to think about.\n\nIf u have any other questions about admissions or campus life feel free to pm me! I'm a char anim metier so i can't really speak for other metiers but i can offer u some idea about campus life and stuff!",

Experimental anim is closer to fine art; they try a lot of different medium, and often their goal isn't to tell a clear cut narrative like char anim does. So it really comed down to ur preference! As for paying off debts, it's really hard to tell bc it would highly depend on ur situation. How much debt u have, what kind of job u get after graduating, etc. The most important thing an international student should know imo is that you have to get a degree to work here, where domestic student could leave without graduating if they got a job. Lmk if u have any other questions!",

And if you're comfortable living in Paris with the language differences and all, go for it! I guess one big difference btwn gobelins and calarts (other than the tuition) is that most of their films are group projects, and they expect u to work in a team, but at calarts ur expected to make ur own individual film. Also calarts offers exchange program with gobelins, so either way u potentially CAN experience both!",

Probably not, your portfolio, artistic output is what they care about, grades not so much. \n\n3. Calarts curriculum is loose so if you need a structured learning environment then this isn\u2019t the school for you. If you like close collaboration between mediums and a flurry of fun and experimentation, calarts is yer jawn. \n\n4. Not sure for art, music was sending in original music, or recordings of yourself essentially a portfolio of work. Baseline portfolios would show a wide variety of technical and beautiful scattered over some different mediums maybe?\n\n5. Campus is beautiful, go to the sub level, gallery night is on Thursday, book your own art show and have a band play. Also flyers are life at calarts.",

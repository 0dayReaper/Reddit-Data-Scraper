    "postText": "I think this school is incredible and if i could do the masters program in experimental animation, I absolutely would. Getting accepted is one hurdle, but how about finances? Would it be possible to attend if I was working a full time job and put some or all of the money into my education? are there opportunities on or near campus to make that possible? Or do I really just need to suck it up and take out loans for it all?",

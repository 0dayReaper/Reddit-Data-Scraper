    "postText": "Hi people, I'm currently a highschool senior who got accepted to both SCAD and CalArts, and I'm having trouble which to attend. \n\nI got scholarships to both schools, which makes it more hard for me to decide. However, SCAD offered me a big scholarship compared to CalArts.\n\nIs there any benefits in attending CalArts? \nWhat's the real issue about CalArts? \nIs CalArt's (after graduating) employment rate really that high? \n\nPlease help!!! \n(To make sure I get unbiased answers, I will be posting this in r/scad as well, with 'CalArts' replaced to 'SCAD' in few lines.) \n\n\nPs. I'm a sound studio geek. I like to work with sounds in general.",

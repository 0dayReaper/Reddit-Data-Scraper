    "postText": "So this might be a bit of a roller coaster but I\u2019m finishing an honours bachelors of medicine in scotland after this next academic year and have realized that medical education is a waking nightmare that I pursued because I was too chicken to try art. I want to take a year off to build up a good application and apply to Cal Arts  but I\u2019m not sure what I should do to make my application stronger seeing as I\u2019ve not really taken any arts related classes since I was like 15.\n\nHas anyone else made the switch from a completely unrelated degree? I don\u2019t know the practicalities of actually managing to pull it off.\n\nI\u2019ve been a digital artist for a long time and work commissions as a side gig during med school, and I\u2019ve spent a lot of time and effort developing my digital art skills but need to get better at diverse mediums.",

It's a rough road but if ur determined to do it, there is always a way! If you'd like u can pm me and i can tell u what my experience was like transitioning into art world. Good luck!",

    "postText": "We have a really nice 3 bedroom apartment near the intersection of Wiley Canyon and Lyons on Avenida Dorena, just two miles from campus.  We're two calarts alums (BFA acting and MFA Experimental Animation), and our roommate (acting MFA) is currently looking to move to a spot down in the city.  \nRent is about $770, and bills (power, water, trash pickup, internet) push the real total to around $860-880.  \nIt's a nice neighborhood, we have a garage, two nice grocery stores within a block (four if you want to go a few blocks down).  \nWe want to keep it a CalArts apartment, so we're hoping to recruit someone incoming.    \nMessage me for more details.",

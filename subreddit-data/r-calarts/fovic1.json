Any opinions? Anyone deciding to go to ArtCenter/Ringling?\n\nPotentially considering LCAD. I also got accepted into SVA, CCA, and SCAD, which I'm not considering anymore, but still willing to discuss.\n\nIt'd also be cool to discuss rejected portfolios/sketchbooks if anyone wants to!",

I\u2019d say try looking at people\u2019s short films or work to see what kind of animation they\u2019re putting out.\nI also know ArtCenter doesn\u2019t have on campus housing, so that\u2019s another thing to consider.",

I hear Ringling has a great reputation for landing jobs, and while ArtCenter does both traditional and CG animation, it's not a usual college experience (hard to find animation examples hm)",

Because I\u2019m self taught and I don\u2019t really have a clear idea of how to apply my skills in a professional way I think the foundation year is where I need to be, and I am planning to put in a transfer app to CalArts because I know that I will have learned more of the technical skills that they are looking for. HOWEVER, I\u2019m not sure if I will want to transfer? Overall I like RISD\u2019s campus and environment so much more but I\u2019m not sure if the animation program at RISD will be what I\u2019m looking for, despite being considered one of the best and it also doesn\u2019t have the same network that Calarts has......... if I get into the RISD/Brown program that\u2019s going to be an even harder decision..\ud83d\ude05",

New here but uHh... as an applicant does getting a CalArts ID and it saying in the Hub that my financial package is being reviewed mean anything if I haven\u2019t gotten a decision yet, or is this something every applicant this year is getting no matter the decision? Based on here no CA decisions seem to be out yet.. I feel like Calarts is playing me lmfao",

    "postText": "I just got my Experimental Pop acceptance letter back and haven't been more excited. I've had my eye on Cal Arts for a while now, but the tuition has always made me uncertain. One question I have is what kind of work have people taken after going through the program? I personally would love to work on film scoring, but would be happy to do anything in the sound arts realm.",

            "comment": "Hey I'm in ExPop! The tuition is a big deal and something to seriously consider. Did you get a scholarship from CalArts? Did you apply to other grants and scholarships outside for CalArts?\n\nAs for film scoring, there are classes you can take but priority enrollment is for Experimental Composition students. To get in you have to submit a film score you've already done to the teacher for approval. ExPop by no means is a substitute for a degree in film composing. As an ExPop student your time will be more taken up by ensembles and requiered classes for at least the first 2 years (if you knock them all out, you can use the last 2 years to take more electives and things you want to do). There's also tons of opprotunities for scoring animators films.\n\nFor sound art, it's a big thing here. There's a class on the History of Sound Art (really fun class, take it!), there's a sound art club who's posters I've seen around. There's also a class more focused on making sound art as well but I'm blanking on the name.\n\nHopefully all this helps! If you want to chat more, DM me!",

I know a lot of about CalArts having been there for 4 years and now also having had time to reflect on my experience there. Would be happy to talk if you want another perspective or have questions or anything\u2014 it\u2019s definitely a unique experience not for everybody! DM me if you want :)",

    "postText": "So, it has become one of my goals to get accepted to the school. When I look at some accepted portfolios online I get a bit discouraged. A lot of them are so realistic and incredibly professional.\n\nThen I look at the work of someone like Pendleton Ward. His drawing is not \u2018good\u2019 in that same sense. It is just exploding with personality. Am I just not seeing the realistic work he got accepted with? Or does personality trump realism and detail in certain senses?",

            "comment": "Hey there! \n\nI'm not an art major (used to be back in high school), but I remember conversation after conversations just like this. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm sure that CalArts wants you to have a thorough understanding of the basics in order for you to apply those to your own work, and once you master the basics you can go on to break those rules and form your own style.\n\nWard's work is extremely expressive and like you said, exudes personality. But there's no doubt in my mind that he got to that point by spending years to fully understand the basics such as human proportions, perspective, shading, drawing from life, color, etc. I'm fairly certain Ward's sketckbook that he applied to CalArts with had of what I stated to show that he's knowledgeable about the fundamentals of drawing. \n\nHaving a solid foundation is critical in any field in order to be able to move on from fundamentals and find out what your style is.",

I\u2019d love to see their more fundamental pieces they applied with, honestly. Some application portfolios I\u2019ve seen are professional level already. Some I\u2019ve seen is more rusty but clearly creative. It\u2019s hard to gauge if you\u2019ve got what it takes, I guess.",

Some people will post their sketchbook, but a lot of others who just showed a lot of potential in story won\u2019t show theirs, because they\u2019re afraid of being judged as unworthy. There\u2019s always a lot of bitterness from people who are rejected, &amp; that imposter syndrome kicks in real hard after acceptance, especially if you think your art isn\u2019t as great, so that\u2019s why you won\u2019t see them posting. But they do get in. Do your own thing. Just show that you play with mediums and you try to observe, and have fun.  They want that openness.",

    "postText": "Hey, just received mine a few minutes ago. Tbh, I knew I might have been rejected since there was a slim chance of getting in the first place. I got into Scad and Ringling so I guess this isn\u2019t too bad of a setback. I just feel disappointed. What did I do wrong? That\u2019s what I want to know.\n\nHeres a link to some of my work: https://imgur.com/gallery/T4fWNWs\n\nI would love feedback. I want to know what I could improve on.",

Scad and Ringling are one of the top schools so i don't think that is a step back for\nYour career. BTW, did you get a scholarship from the schools?",

Try work with more environments by sitting somewhere in real life and just drawing the space around you. When I was applying, they emphasised the importance of being able to draw figures in space.",

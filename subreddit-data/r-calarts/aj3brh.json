            "comment": "Calarts Student Here!\nIt's the same requirements as most BFA programs I think. However, many of the classes you take will fulfill those requirements. Because of this, you end up taking a lot more classes in your specialty than most schools. If you get the chance, its wise to knock some of those credits out of the way at first. I'd reccomend taking some GE classes at a community college in your time leading up to calarts. It really helps get stuff out of the way!",

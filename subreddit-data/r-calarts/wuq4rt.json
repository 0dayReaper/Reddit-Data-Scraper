    "postText": "Hey, so I\u2019m a incoming freshman for illustration at another school (FIT in New York City) and was wondering about transferring and switching to character animation at CalArts since that school has always been a dream of mine and I think I\u2019m ready to start trying for it. How easy is it to transfer? Is the process difficult? Has anyone else completely switched majors just to go to CalArts (and maybe specifically coming from out of state)? Any advice for portfolio shit and how I can start working to try and get accepted? Is this even attainable? I need help because I need to escape New York and I want to attain my dreams of becoming an animator!",

            "comment": "Hey! I'm in the music school but have lots of friends in animation.\n\nYou can transfer in, however, in character animation you will always start from year 1. The program is thoroughly set up to teach you specific things in a specific order, so it wouldn't be possible to jump in half way.\n\nOne thing I'd strongly recomend is to get your GE studies out of the way, if you haven't already. Calarts does have GE requirements (math, social studies, history, etc) therefore you need to take classes in those subjects while at school. Unlike most schools though, they offer classes which both teach your GE needs while staying within your major. (In music, for instance, they teach us about the physics of room acoustics.) As great as that is, it can be nice to be able to skip those classes and instead take classes more focused on what you're interested in. Plus, character animation is a bunch of work, and as little overhead from other classes as possible is ultimately for the best.",

                    "comment": "Thanks so much for the advice! This definitely helps since I chose a lot of GE classes for the semester and am probably gonna do so for spring too. I also don\u2019t mind starting from year one if I have to, just as long as I get to do it, it\u2019d just be nice, plus I\u2019m just tryna get out of my state too. I\u2019d definitely describe myself as a hard worker if I really want something, so animation is definitely something I\u2019m up for, it\u2019s always been my #1 goal as an artist since I\u2018ve loved doing it as a hobby. But yeah! Definitely will be getting those GE requirements out of the way in my incoming freshman year to make it easier on myself.",

I was accepted! It took extra work on the side as i only used one of my school assignments in my final port but yes it\u2019s totally possible. if u would like more specific advice or anything u can pm me :D. good luck!!",

But if you don\u2019t mind I might PM for some advice in a bit! Can definitely use the help cause I\u2019m so done with NY, and I don\u2019t wanna give up on CalArts just because I wasn\u2019t motivated to apply in my senior year of HS. I really wanna work my ass off to get in the next time I can apply to transfer.",

I was originally a film studies &amp; graphic design student at my local community college but I applied for theater here at CalArts. \n\nI\u2019m glad I transferred because I felt that my portfolio was stronger having spent a few years developing it at my community college before applying to CalArts. During the application they didn\u2019t really take into account that I was a transfer student until I was accepted; it didn\u2019t affect my chances at all except mentally and personally. \n\nCalArts calls GenEd \u201cCritical Studies\u201d and, correct, they don\u2019t bring over your studio type classes. You can try to appeal this decision with your CalArts mentor but imo if you\u2019re coming to CalArts for the art classes, take the art classes here. \n\nThese are the classes that transferred from my community college:\n\nFilm as Literature\n\nIntro to Psych\n\nOral Business Communications\n\nTheatre Appreciation\n\nGeneral Astronomy\n\nHistory of Animation\n\nI recommend searching for the CalArts course catalog and comparing your community colleges\u2019 courses against any of the classes that are in the following categories: AAIC, ACOM, ACSE, ACST, AHMN, CAIC, CCIS, CCOM, CCRW, CCSE, CCST, CHMN, CSCM, CSOC, DAIC, DCSE, DSCM, FAIC,FCOM, FCSE, FSCM, ICOM, ICSE, MAIC, MCOM, MCSE, MHST, MSCM, TAIC,TCSE or TSCM.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that they will only accept at max 38 credits from your previous school because, out of the 46 credits needed for your Critical Studies requirement, 8 credits must be taken at CalArts.",

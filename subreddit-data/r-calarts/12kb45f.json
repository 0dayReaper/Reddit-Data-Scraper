I am at a CSU trying to get a degree in film and media arts who wants to make a tv show one day but there are a few things I want to learn that the school I'm going to doesn't offer or I'd get more in depth here  I am set to graduate next year could I do a post grad degree in animation or not have to do another 4 year?",

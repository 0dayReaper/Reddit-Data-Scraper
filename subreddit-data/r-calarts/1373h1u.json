I'm Sarvani, an art student (specializing in painting and textiles), and I'm working on a platform that helps art students thrift and resell their supplies instead of constantly having to buy new ones, which can be really inaccessible and wasteful!\n\nI am looking to interview art students about their experiences buying supplies.

    "postText": "I was wondering about the Max amount of financial aid/merit aid that it\u2019s possible to receive from the school, particularly from the CA program! I know that myself along with a few other students plan to reapply in hopes of having a lower cost than the previous offer, so I guess my question (if you\u2019re comfortable sharing) is how much you have received from the school in terms of finaid/how much have you heard of a student receiving?\n** I\u2019m aware that this year in particular they removed some scholarships such as Lillian Disney scholarship if I\u2019m correct? I don\u2019t know how much of a difference as opposed to past year that makes!\n\nEDIT: Also I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s VERY rare, but apparently someone in EA was able to transfer into BFA2 instead of starting over for 4 years of schooling after transferring? That would be a miracle scenario!",

While I'm stoked I got in I'm concerned about the debt I'll be going into, the class load and what would come afterward for when I graduate. I was wondering if any of you guys know of alumni who've graduated from Cal's art program that wouldn't mind sharing their #'s or email addresses so I can talk to them about the program. Thank You!",

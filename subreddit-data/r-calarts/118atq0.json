The bigwigs at Pixar and other major studios come to see projects for animation. The fine arts projects look incredible. I would see if people who do graphic arts/grad make good connections in the job field and if the professors seem like they are worth learning from. Read their bios and maybe email them and ask questions. CalArts is a unique place and truly collaborative.",

I\u2019m not super interested in their program anyways and doubt I would have gone, but I was just curious! I know CalArts is super strong in animation and music, but I was personally a little skeptical about graphic design (though I\u2019m sure it\u2019s still very good!).",

The issues are how small the school is and that it is definitely for \"go getters\" who will take advantage of the opportunities. Not all students have the personality for that, but we suspected it would be the case when my kid went there.",

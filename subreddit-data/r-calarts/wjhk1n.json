Pros/Cons, student life (do you even get to have a life?)\n\nI also need to know what financial packages are available for students. \nThanks!!",

            "comment": "The program teaches you how to be independent as a stage manager and encourages you to work through your challenges as much as you can on your own before reaching out for faculty/staff guidance. While this helps to build up confidence as a manager, it can be frustrating due to the lack of helpful communication at the onset. As an MFA stage manager, the faculty and staff will hold you in high expectations that you are able to do your job, falling back on this model when problems arise. The con to this metric is that stage managers frequently get blame placed on them for communication breakdowns, missed designer deadlines, etc. What the program does really well is provide a myriad of stage management opportunities throughout your 3 years in the program. Despite not being allowed to call a show your first year within the School of Theatre, other schools (most notably the School of Dance) is always in need of stage managers for the thesis projects of their students, which is an amazing chance to call for first year MFA stage managers. The program also does not constrain its managers to a specific discipline of stage management (straight plays, musicals, opera, themed entertainment, events, etc) but rather encourages them to branch out to explore any and all forms, actively providing them chances. However, you will only get the best out of this aspect of the program what you put into it - you don\u2019t ask the questions or tell the adults what you\u2019re interested in and what you want to do, you can\u2019t expect it to just be handed to you. We have to work for it and market ourselves. \n\nFinancial aid wise it differs for each person depending on need and merit. It accounts for a rather small percentage of the overall cost.",

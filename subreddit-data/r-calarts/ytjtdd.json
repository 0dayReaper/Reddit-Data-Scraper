    "postText": "Hi, I was planning on applying to the experimental animation BFA and was wondering if it\u2019s really worth spending 120,000 or so dollars for it. I\u2019ve always wanted to work in the animation industry I\u2019m just worried I\u2019ll be stuck with debt for the rest of my life even if I find a job. \n\nWhat type of job could I even get with this degree? Is the network really worth it? Please let me know if I should work on the character animation portfolio instead. Thanks!!",

But if you're not coming in to an expensive school esp CALARTS without knowing what you wanna do you're wasting money. Even the character animation program. Don't go in straight out of highschool if you can help it, if you get all your credits done at community college you can graduate a year  early at least in character. That's 60k in savings for a couple years making films and at community college. You gotta figure out what you want to make and start making it *before* you go to school. If you wanna make it worth the 120k you kinda gotta bust ass but I have plenty of friends who graduated and feel like it's worth it. I quit bc of the cost, you can always just drop out lol. This industry doesn't care, unless you wanna teach.",

                    "comment": "Actually the opposite is true; u can't graduate early in character. It has very rigid 4 yr program that u have to attend in order to get a degree. You can't skip a yr or two in character even with transfer credits from other schools. But yes, u can quit/drop out if ur a domestic student and get a job if u feel like you've learned enough and are ready for the industry. But I agree on everything else. You gotta know what u wanna do b4 going in. EA and CA are very different. Esp for EA, u gotta have a very clear vision for what u wanna do cuz it's more fine artsy where ur voice is the foremost priority. If u r interested in the general narrative driven story and animation CA would be better for u, but if u wanna do something more outside the box and literally experiment with the medium of animation EA would be better.",

My heart has always been set on claymation/stop motion which is why I\u2019m drawn  to experimental in the first place, I just fear it\u2019s not a \u201cpractical\u201d degree. I mean is there really any place that needs an experimental animation degree? I also fear I won\u2019t learn as much as a character animator would. Uggggh!",

    "postText": "Wow dude. I am having an unbelievable amount of trouble writing my artistic statement. I feel like my hands are paralyzed. Like I can't seem to formulate my thoughts in an organized way that answers every part of the prompt. I'm applying for the music tech program. Any music students that are willing to help? (Maybe sending me your artistic statements so I can get some inspiration?) Any help would be a god send. Thank you.",

            "comment": "Pretend you are having a conversation with someone you don\u2019t know about why you are passionate about music. Be as authentic and real and honest as possible. Maybe record yourself speaking naturally and try to clean it up into a written document. It\u2019s very difficult to just sit down and write something like that but if you get started just talking out loud and not worried about making mistakes or not saying something perfectly it can help a lot. Don\u2019t try to rush it at the last minute. Give yourself at least several 1-2 hour sessions over at least a week and pretend that you are not yourself when you reread it. Pretend you are a stranger and ask questions, even if you think the answers are obvious they might not be to somebody else.",

So address what you would like to get out of this opportunity and then put in what you would like to contribute to this opportunity. They want to know how collaborative you\u2019re going to be and how you will fit into the culture there. I ended up writing a very long artist statement, actually my story, explaining who I was and where I came from. It is really a freestyle type essay. I freaked out about it for 18 months. I finally just sat down and did a voice to text doc and worked it from there.\n\nI was accepted on December 22nd to the MFA in VoiceArts. \ud83e\udd13\ud83d\ude33\ud83e\udd73\ud83c\udfa4\ud83c\udfb6",

            "comment": "You should indicate your awareness of some of the history of the music department there. This means you're aware of the experimental tilt and aren't just looking for someplace \"close to L.A.\" with an intention of commercial music. I heard of several highly qualified applicants rejected for that reason. They didn't know what they were getting into. Someone who knows and is interested in how technology has been employed in \"new music\" is probably a better fit than someone who knows every piece of commercial equipment in existence but whose musical interests/knowledge are confined to their pop band. Make sure you indicate your awareness/interest in what current/recent faculty have been involved in.",

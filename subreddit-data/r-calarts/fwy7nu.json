            "comment": "I finished my MFA in Music Tech in 2019, happy to chat. IMO, the vibe of MTIID at CalArts is a lot more than just music production and sound design. It's more about approaching the idea of music making from a technology perspective--musical robots, algorithmic composition, interface design, plugin design, etc--and integrating this in with other media. Students in the program generally build a multimedia art installation during the course of their studies, design their own instrument, and perform with the tools that they develop in class and with mentors. \n\nIf you're more interested in producing tracks, this may not be the program for you. While everyone in the program will be able to talk music production, MTIID as a dept is trying to get you to think bigger than that.",

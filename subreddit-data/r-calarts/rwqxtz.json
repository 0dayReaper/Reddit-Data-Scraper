            "comment": "Personally as a transfer student in my last semester, it's been difficult for me to meet people, but that's thanks to the fact that I'm introverted. The school's social life is very vibrant and if you're open to meeting new people and making friends (and not let yourself be crippled by social anxiety), you'll be fine I think. Thursday nights (also known as gallery nights, which is basically a party and student's art displayed for you to look at) are a big thing so keep that time slot open for your calendar.\n\nOne thing I realized as a transfer student is that a lot of people already have their established friend groups since they had the first two years to meet people and find groups. I met the friends I've been able to make through the clubs, the school radio, and the meet and greet you do when you first come to CalArts. I've never made a friend in class, but that's just my experience.\n\nGood luck! If you have any other questions feel free to DM me.",

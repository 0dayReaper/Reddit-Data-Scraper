It never came, and I barely made it work with finances after loans and family help.\n\nThey\u2019re a private institution and will provide scant grant and funding opportunities. You\u2019ll have to apply to those and it\u2019s a guessing game. Definitely the only real negative to the school. Everything else is great in my opinion. You\u2019ll become a heightened version of yourself and amplify your creative output.",

It doesn\u2019t cover the dorm and meal plan but I am able to split that into a monthly payment and use the BAH payment from the GI bill to cover it.",

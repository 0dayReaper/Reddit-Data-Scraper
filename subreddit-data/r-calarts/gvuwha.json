            "comment": "I'm not in the animation or art department but if no one answers you here (this sub ebbs and flows in terms of activity) there's tons of youtube videos of people sharing their experiences. Usually the workload is tough for every department so if you apply, expect to spend your days animating and drawing constantly if you don't already. I'm in the music department but I usually have class anywhere from 6-8 hours per day 5 days a week. Hopefully someone in the animation department could chime in here to give you more specific info.\n\nAs for if it's worth it, you'll be more than $250k in debt once all is said and done (tuition raises 2-5% each year). You're not guaranteed a job at Disney or Pixar or anything like that, it just gives you a better chance of getting hired (but don't bank on it).",

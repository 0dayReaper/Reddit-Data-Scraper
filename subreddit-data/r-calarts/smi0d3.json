My best advice is to just be creative and think about what the song means to you, and how you can represent that in your artwork.\n\nFor example I'm doing my piece based on the lyrics \"used to play pretend give each other different names we would build a rocket ship and then we'll fly us far away\" because it's always been really personal to me and my experiences, but that's just what I'm doing. Overall there's no right or wrong answer to it, so just draw whatever comes to mind that feels like you :)",

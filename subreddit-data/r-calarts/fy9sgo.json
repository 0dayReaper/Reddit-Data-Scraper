    "postText": "I am having a hard time choosing between USC's SCA undergraduate animation program and Calarts Character Animation program. I am interested in and would like to learn more about character design, storyboard, and animation, which are probably Calarts advantages, but I am worried about the environment there. I think USC absolutely has a better university atmosphere and the living there shall be more convinient. \n\nCan I reach the same effect in my studying in USC as that in Calarts if I have already known where I am putting my effort into? Or could you give me any advice on choosing between these two regardless of the difficulty level of being accepted? Also I wish there are students in Calarts CA program here, I have more questions about Calarts&gt;&lt;",

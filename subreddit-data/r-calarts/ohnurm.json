I\u2019m on the waitlist for on-campus housing but they haven\u2019t sent me anything yet, so I assume I\u2019m going to be living off-campus. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have a car, and it\u2019s not really within walking distance. Anyone have any advice on this situation? CalArts hasn\u2019t really done a great job communicating these things.",

            "comment": "Current CalArtian here! There are two housing neighborhoods/complexes walking distance from CalArts: Lakeshore and Woodglen. If you\u2019re looking for places, I\u2019d look there. If you can\u2019t get a place there, biking is a great option, if you\u2019re medium-close to campus. You could try taking the bus, but the public transportation is pretty bad here\u2014super unreliable :/\n\nThese are good options, but my honest advice would be to try and invest in a car asap. LA is a really tough place to live without one, and its suburbs are even worse, since everything is so spread out. If it\u2019s at all an option, it would be smart.\n\nBest of luck! Hope you do end up in a dorm, or find a good place! \u2764\ufe0f",

I was #1 on the waitlist in Fall 2019 and still didn't get a room, but it doesn't hurt to know.\n\nThere's a facebook group that's full of people looking for roommates: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/183402262261087](https://www.facebook.com/groups/183402262261087)",

            "comment": "If money is no object, you could take uber/lyft but it gets prettttty expensive. Alternatively, biking isn't a bad option. Santa Clarita has pretty nice biking paths everywhere. I could get from the Westfield mall to Calarts in about 15 minutes by bike if you want a general idea of the time/distances.  \nBiking isn't the most convenient option and admittedly it does get pretty hot anywhere from may-oct. I think I'm probably one of the few crazy people that could bike fine in 90 degree weather, and I lived on a pretty extreme budget at the time so I made it work. TBH, if you live in LA, having a car makes life a lot easier so the sooner you can get one, the more convenient your life will be.  \nBest of luck",

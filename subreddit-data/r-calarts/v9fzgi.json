    "postText": "Context: I'm a rising junior in high school and I've always had an interest in animation but I'm too afraid to pursue it. I'm still really unsure if I want to truly pursue it, but I'm trying to think realistically to see if I should invest time into creating a portfolio.\n\nI'll only be able to take AP Drawing my senior year, so college apps will be done by the time I finish with my AP Drawing portfolio. Additionally, I have little to no experience with drawing professional digital drawings (it's just a hobby and they're pretty bad). If I do decide to apply to Calarts, it will be for Character Animation which is ridiculously hard to get into in the first place.\n\nWhat should I do? Will I even have enough time to make a portfolio since (and also how do I make one, are there any limitations on what software I can use, etc).",

It is too expensive of a school to pay for if you are not sure of your path. \n\nThat being said, if you are sure that Character Animation is your future, apply! Worst thing that\u2019ll happen is you get a No and feedback on how you can improve for next time! \n\nGood luck OP!",

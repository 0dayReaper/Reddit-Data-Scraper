    "postText": "Hi there, first timer. I'm a comic book artist that got a little unlucky in life... But my daughter is only 14 and incredibly talented (for me sure, but she does have skills). She is interested in persuing animation as a career and she is already doing a ton of stuff, at an early age got her tablets to start her on digital drawing but she's went ahead and jumped into animation with apps like flipaclip and others. I built her a really nice PC and she jumped right into 3d animating.\n\nThere are 2 things, first she is really into Roblox and similar games related animation and memes, and even tho I really don't see it as an exclusive path to go she is getting pretty good, even editing and scoring her videos herself (usually dedicated to different gamer YouTubers, or animating their dialog). WHAT COULD BE A BETTER WAY TO GET HER CLOSE TO WHAT CALARTS WANTS TO SEE?\n\nSecond, she is an American citizen by birth but we live on Asian since she was 3, she speaks English well tho. There are a few animation courses here in college but I think she could really use going to CALARTS or another school more connected in the US, since I think part of the reason I haven't really broken into comics myself is the lack of connections (I'm full time indie artist but I have really low rates). So I actually don't know this question... Mmm... How uhh can she... What can I expect to do to help her get in there, I mean monetarily perhaps? Can she qualify for a loan? Or how can I help her prepare to apply for an scholarship?\n\nPlease be kind to me lol, sorry if this doesn't make much sense (is 6 am here and I have insomnia), any info at all you'd like to provide will be absolutely helpful. Thanks!!",

More than anything, I recommend making a list of a few possible places to apply to, because there are never guarantees. Having \"that one dream school\" can be a let down in the end. Look here and elsewhere for those portfolios, good luck!",

Don\u2019t worry about making mistakes or finishing the art off to look perfect. Just keep filling pages and then move onto the next sketchbook. Rinse and repeat for a few years..",

If she is into game design and 3D then other schools may be a better fit, it all depends on how her ART matures in the next few years. CalArts seem to be more gearing in developing a creative experimental kind  of alumni, or into those wanting to be a director of animation, developing their STORYBOARD skills. Her FIT on whatever school she goes will lean on her goals aside from her art and creative passion. Goodluck again!",

She is really good at traditional art but she gets more \"kudos\" online for her digital stuff, so we'll see. We live in Taiwan so if she goes the game design route, we probably stay local as well.",

    "postText": "Calarts is my absolute dream school. I am reaaaally lucky to be born with a father that can afford to pay calarts tuition fee's for the entire 4 years, and i know that for most people that's a deciding factor, and because my family can afford it it just motivates me to get accepted into it even more. Adding to the fact i'm only twelve, I've got the time to get ready.\n\nI love animation, and have since 2013. I've been animating for a year and randomly drawing for 5. I've been looking at this school and the alternatives, and would kill to go. Problem is, I compared the acceptance rates and was blown away. 27.5%??? Only 27.5%????? How on earth am I going to get accepted? It just leaves a huge pit in my stomach. I plan to apply in 6 years. Looking at accepted and rejected students portfolios make's me think wow, how on earth will I get to that level??\nI don't even know my chances, and I know that hard work isn't sadly the only thing that'll get me in. Observational drawings, figure drawings and others. I have no idea where to start at all. I want the highest chances of getting in, but with the information online, It all is just way to confusing. I guess i'm an average beginner, and I've got 6 years to prepare. I don't want to waste those six years. What got you in, and what advice would you give me? Thanks in advance.",

            "comment": "The best advice I would give you is to simply not give up. You are heading in the right direction at your age and as long as you draw people from life, be consistent with drawing, and enjoy what you are doing, you will definitely get into calarts. I didnt learn about calarts until I was 14 but ever since then I've improved to the point to where I'm confident in applying this fall. Back when I first saw the calarts sketchbook videos in 2014 I was scared that I would never improve and thought it would be impossible, much like you. But ever since I had my head set on calarts, I've improved more and more. Just make sure to look at other artist other than people in the animation industry (but also look at them) like painters. And make sure to keep trying to new things. Try oil painting, gouache, colored pencils, pens, anything to be honest, and by the time you're at calarts you will have learned enough to get in! Also one thing I wish I knew earlier is to keep up a social media account like instagram or tumblr and just post your artwork. Maybe not now, but when you're around 15 with a more developed style. Calarts likes accepting \"famous\" students, and it helps you connect with other artist your age, or even helps you meet the greats! Also if you havent yet, google CSSSA. Its a summer program at calarts that really helps you out in the application and helps you become a better artist. Good luck, and dont give up!",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm hoping this is allowed, sorry if it isn't.\n\nCalarts is my dream school because of the amount of teachers who have a hand in the animation industry. I want to be an animator and have my own show some day, so being able to make connections is going to get me farther then anything else. That being said, I've heard it's hard to get into calarts for a lot of reasons and I don't think I'd be able to get in. My biggest issue being my own art skills, if read that they like to take people who have realistic styles over cartoony and mine is way more cartoony. So now I come to my question, what other schools can I make connections with people in the animation industry like how I'd be able to do at calarts? At this point I don't care about things like student debt, I'll take whatever debt I have to to get my dream job I just don't know where to go. I've only ever heard about the teacher at calarts being the ones that can help get you into the industry.\n\nThanks in advance!",

The schools I would suggest you look at: School of Visual Arts in NYC, Rhode Island School of Design, Savannah College of Art and Design, USC Cinematic Arts, UCLA, NYU Tisch. I can\u2019t guarantee that any of those will be exactly what you\u2019re looking for, nor that they will be easy to get into, but consider this list a jumping off point to do your own research.\n\nEdit: Also, Ringling College of Art and Design",

If you live in LA County, consider going to campus events like guest panels, short film showings, anything you can get into. There is also a summer animation residency which is expensive but I think easier to get enrolled in. Unfortunately it\u2019s not happening this year but it looks like it may be brought back next summer(?)",

I'm trying to do that rn and it's a pain in the butt because there is no UNDERGRAD animation program, only graduate (MFA). You can apply to the film school and do a concentration in animation, but it's an extremely small program, and nothing like the art schools on the list. \n\n If you're looking at California public schools, SJSU has the best undergrad anim program. Hope this helps c:",

SVA had both good 2D and 3D animation programs and not as hard to get in as Calarts and Ringling. SCAD is probably the safest choice because it is not as selective, but also has great animation program and industry connections.",

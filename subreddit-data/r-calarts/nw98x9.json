    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI recently became interested in applying to Cal Arts for their art program. However, I quickly was discouraged when I came across the cost of a years tuition. Has anyone ever received scholarships or financial aid that made up for most of their tuition. I plan to put in hard work and make an outstanding portfolio. Also, what are the scholarships or funding I should be looking at before applying? Any insight is welcome. Thanks!",

I'm a transfer student so I only have to pay half of a 4 year college experience, but CalArts essentially said I can only use half of the scholarship I received since only a certain amount can be used per year (leaving half left that I believe they'll take back and redistribute into the scholarship money pool). Just a note though, I've never heard of anyone who's ever gotten a \"full ride\" to CalArts, so don't count on that happening.\n\nIf you really want to go to CalArts, apply to as many scholarships as you possibly can. If you have nothing to do, make it your day job for a bit and look for scholarships. Also you can even apply for scholarships while you're in college, it doesn't have to be just before college. Continuously be applying for scholarships. I've heard of some people who've gotten tuition (not at CalArts specifically) pretty much down to $0 by just applying to every scholarships they could throughout their entire time at college.\n\nIf you are non-white, female, LGBT+, first in your family to go to college, etc. that should help in your search and open more doors for scholarships. Don't be afraid to milk what you have. If you're a straight white dude, I think it'll be more difficult to find as many scholarships, but still, apply to as many that you qualify for to lower the overall burden you're going to have to pay back with student loans.\n\nHope this helps. Good luck.",

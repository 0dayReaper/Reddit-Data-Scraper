I used video references for some of my figs for in portfolio and sketchbook due to the pandemic + my third world country not having resources. it should be fine if you do too! If you have family members or friends that can help you should ask them to pose (doesn\u2019t have to be naked) because that counts as a life model too. (Ex: I drew my grandma at the dinner table and my sister lazing around the house for my portfolio) My only advice is don\u2019t draw off popular reference pics (ex: stuff on Pinterest) because you may end up having the same pic as several other applicants. Hope this helped!",

You can also draw your own hands and feet.\n\nLive means that you aren't drawing from a picture.",

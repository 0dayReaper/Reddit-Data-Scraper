    "postText": "I'm an incoming transfer student from a community college majoring in experimental pop/musical arts. I'm transferring into CalArts as a 3rd year student. I've been taking roughly 3-5 units for the last few semesters at my community college (very low since I've been done with GE and the program I went through), and now I have 15 units at CalArts, which apparently is average. I talked to a few MFAs who've been taking over 20 units, which is incredible. \n\nI'm just wondering how the workload is for the music classes and also critical studies?",

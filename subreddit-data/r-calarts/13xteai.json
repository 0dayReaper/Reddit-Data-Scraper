So, I have a few questions for those of you in the Photo and Media program.\n\nWhat do you usually learn in your major courses? Besides photography, I'm curious what else you focus on! And I'd love to know how your projects are typically structured!!\n\nDo you think this major would be beneficial if I want to work in video or film in the future? I'm also curious about what you learn related to Media!!\n\nIt would be really, really, really great if you could share your thoughts about the program!! Thanks!",

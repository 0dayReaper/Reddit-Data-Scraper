    "postText": "Hi, so I'm planning to get in calarts 2023 but I just realise that the dorms are not pet friendly.I have a pet cockatiel that is my sole responsibility (as my family cannot look after her), and that I plan to bring with me to US(International, I cannot leave my bird behind in my home country).Is there any advice I can get on how to deal with this, I know that I could find housing out of campus but I also know it's important for freshmen to stay in the dorms for friendship building, and also I'm afraid outside leasing may be more expensive.Thank you for reading my predicament.",

Anyone who visits your room would know.  And anyone who had to come to your room for maintenance - emergency or routine - would know.  \n\nEventually, you will be caught and told that the bird has to go.\n\nHave you checked to see if it is even possible to bring the bird with you to the US?",

That's the only idea I can think of.",

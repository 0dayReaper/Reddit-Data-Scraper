I draw figures starting off by drawing out the silhouette\n3. Then I look closely making sure that I get their form and space right \n4. Then I draw in features making sure that I get proportion right\n5. Ect\n6. I end up losing a lot of stamina and my pictures end up looking inaccurate in the end anyway",

By the end of the semester, my one minute drawings looked like my five minute drawings, and my five minute drawings looked like my ten minute drawings. Eventually, you'll be able to get the same amount of information down in fewer strokes.\n\nI find it's not necessary to do those stick figure \"skeletons\", as they tend to make my drawings stiff. Good, clear poses are essentially caricatures of the actual pose. You're not trying to get accuracy, you're going for the \"essence\" of the pose.",

            "comment": "Everything I found when looking for places to live off-campus were extremely expensive (sometimes upward of $1,000/month for a room with a shared bathroom). I'd honestly recommend on-campus if you can. Expect small and expensive (unless you're lucky).\n\nIt's more expensive to live on-campus than off-campus. Plus, you'd be walking distance from your classes, you don't have to drive so you save money on gas. That also means if you live off-campus and want to attend an event later in the day, you'd either have to drive to campus again or stay after your class for hours. There's nothing really to do outside of the campus.",

It took me a while to find a place at a price less than $1k/month (spent around a month and a half during the semester looking and ended up paying 850 for a room and a shared bathroom), but I've heard of places going for lower. Ideally you should try and live as close to campus as you can but it's not always possible. I ended up living 20 minutes away from campus which was a pain for me. \n\nThere's always posters on the walls at calarts of people either looking for roommates or landlords looking for college students, you'll find more than enough there. There's also a [calarts housing facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/183402262261087) where you can find people posting rooms for rent.",

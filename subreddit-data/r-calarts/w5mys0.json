    "postText": "I'm about to apply for classes at my local community college (STLCC) and I was wondering what kind of gen eds I should take that could go towards CalArts experimental animation program. I talked to the admissions office at CalArts and from what I could gather studio art courses do not transfer over.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m an incoming transfer student. \n\nCalArts calls GenEd \u201cCritical Studies\u201d and, correct, they don\u2019t bring over your studio type classes. You can try to appeal this decision with your CalArts mentor but imo if you\u2019re coming to CalArts for the art classes, take the art classes here. \n\nThese are the classes that transferred from my community college:\n\nFilm as Literature\n\nIntro to Psych\n\nOral Business Communications\n\nTheatre Appreciation\n\nGeneral Astronomy\n\nHistory of Animation\n\nI recommend searching for the CalArts course catalog and comparing your community colleges\u2019 courses against any of the classes that are in the following categories: AAIC, ACOM, ACSE, ACST, AHMN, CAIC, CCIS, CCOM, CCRW, CCSE, CCST, CHMN, CSCM, CSOC, DAIC, DCSE, DSCM, FAIC,FCOM, FCSE, FSCM, ICOM, ICSE, MAIC, MCOM, MCSE, MHST, MSCM, TAIC,TCSE or TSCM.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that they will only accept at max 38 credits from your previous school because, out of the 46 credits needed for your Critical Studies requirement, 8 credits must be taken at CalArts.",

I wish I had thought to ask this question when I was going to community college, but my counselor didn\u2019t want to put in the effort to help me transfer to a private school and instead got me ready for a state school \ud83d\ude43\n\nIf you have any additional questions feel free to reach out or even join the discord server!",

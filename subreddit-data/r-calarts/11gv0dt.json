    "postText": "I just got accepted for admission as a transfer, which I'm very happy about, of course. \n\nBut the acceptance letter placed me at the BFA 2-1 level, which I'm not so enthusiastic about. I was hoping to transfer to the upper level classes, especially given the CC agreement pathway I went with before applying.\n\nIs there an appeal I can make to admissions before attending, or do I have to stick with it for a semester before I can ask to be placed higher?",

I transferred in this year and my original acceptance had me at 2-1, but by the time I actually registered for classes, and the registrar had time to sort through my transfer credits, had it changed it to 3-1. It definitely varies program to program but CalArts does require you to take some metier specific classes at the institute whether or not you\u2019ve already taken something similar. Talk to your mentor/advisor as soon as possible and they can help you communicate with the registrar. Welcome to CalArts!!",

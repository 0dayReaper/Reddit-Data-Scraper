    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m actually not in CalArts, but I\u2019m currently a junior who lives in a different country who hopes to make it into CalArts! Our system here is kind of different here, since you have to pick a sort of more generalized \u201ccourse\u201d to study for 2 more years (technically, that would be our junior and senior year of high school in US terms haha) after you graduate from 10th grade. I\u2019m currently taking up visual arts as my sort of \u201ccourse\u201d in that field, and I plan to take up the Graphic Design program in CalArts through a full scholarship! My mother has already petitioned me to immigrate over to the US most likely next year after I graduate from high school. What are the requirements that I need to take up in order to pass their scholarship program? Is it really true that essays are literally everywhere, even in college? Our system relies more on performance than written works here. What is the life over there like? Is it toxic? Is it great? I\u2019d love to know. Thank you in advance!!!\n\nSincerely,\nA hopeful one",

If you are going to get either a citizenship or a green card before you apply to the school, you are more likely to get a bigger scholarship than an average international student though. It really depends on your portfolio; if you have a really strong one, you are going to get a bigger scholarship. The biggest amount I know someone received was 25k, which covers about half the tuition. Calarts does offer you more grants and scholarships depending on your performance while you are there, so there is a chance to get more money after you get accepted and enter the program.",

You might be better going for one of those programs... on their website they list a number of sources for outside scholarships. Many of them are available to international students\n\nAs for the life.. it's located in a nice city, a bit boring but nice. The school itself is like most places. Depends on who you hang out with and what you make of it. It is an art school so a bit less structured/rigid than a classical school, plenty of free spirits wandering the campus...lol",

Find your friends, focus on your classes and focus on your personal projects and don\u2019t worry about the people that aren\u2019t there to learn and just slack off. It can be really fun because there\u2019s no security cameras and the staff and faculty in the security department are all pretty chill making for a an anxiety free environment to wander around and chill.",

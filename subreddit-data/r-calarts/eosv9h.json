    "postText": "So I applied for Composition and Experimental Sound Practices last year late with a pretty bad artist statement and was rightfully rejected. This year I cleaned my application up and applied for the same program as well as Experimental pop. My applications are already in, but I'm still a little confused on the specifics of each program.",

            "comment": "I'm in Experimental Pop. The programs are similar, there's a lot of overlap between the classes, but with Comp/ESP you'll be focusing on instrumental composition which are required while ExPop requires more studio production and ensemble classes.\n\nIn ExPop it's more geared towards self-producers, bedroom producers, experimental artists. Apparently there used to be a lot of people in bands making experimental music, but now a lot of people I'm having class with are trap/hip hop producers. It's also geared to get you connecting with other musician, forming bands, and playing live. You can always switch specializations once you get here if you find that Experimental Pop isn't for you. \n\nYou'll have to take the core curriculum regardless of what you major in, although there are less classes to take overall in ExPop.",

I couldn't bring my laptop so I just improvised a piece on the piano in the room. The two people interviewing me asked me about my inspirations, what I see myself doing kn 5 years, why I want to go to CalArts specifically over other schools, etc.",

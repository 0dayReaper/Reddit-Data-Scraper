    "postText": "Hello people,\n\nReally jealous of y'all. Asian parents force me to go do premed and so I am gonna do it, but I have always wanted to learn animation and get into the industry later on. How do I prepare for CalArts starting now so that once I graduate Med School, I can apply and hopefully get in? Somethings to know, I basically cannot afford anything bc Asian parents will not put any money towards this love of my life and so all I have is just office supplies, a computer, and basically any book (thx to libgen).\n\nSo if you could recommend me basically a **comprehensive list of books /textbooks in regards to animation, drawing, digital art, and storytelling** that would help me go from scratch to somewhat being familiar with the ideas that you guys learn in your courses.",

            "comment": "Damn sorry dude, hopefully you can live your dreams! I also wanted to go to CalArts but parents wanted me to go to Berkeley which is still fine. Doesn\u2019t CalArts require a sketchbook tour? Or did it just change to a portfolio? \nI do not know much about animation but doing lots of sketches from life of random people and paying attention to light direction and YouTube videos about figure drawing may help. I also know that there are free animation apps on iPhone which I have used to animate a few clips. As for story telling, I do not know any books but I do recommend doing a story based on your own dream of wanting to study arts but having to go into premed. This way, you know the purpose, maybe it can help you to set the mood and atmosphere of each scene. \nAlso for the sketch book, try to draw mostly from life and to create your own voice within your work. My friend who got into cal arts submitted a few figure drawing that were 2 min poses to 1 hr poses. New Masters Academy offers free live poses on YouTube. Sorry I wasn\u2019t much help and good luck!",

            "comment": "You may actually have an advantage. If you learn physiology and anatomy at a laser level, you can parlay that into animation which relies heavily on accuracy in drawing. Draw, draw and draw some more. Break down body mechanics and then overlay your creativity with character design. Focus on storytelling. \n\nOne of the best animation students I remember who went from CalArts to Disney was a physics student. Another was an engineer. Take your situation and turn it into an advantage. Best of luck.",

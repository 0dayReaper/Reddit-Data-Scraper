But there are literally no information provided in my country\u2019s art\u2022animation community! So this is the only way I can get informations about calarts. Help!\n\n+ I heard that calarts nearly doesn\u2019t care at all about my gpa cuz my portfolio is way more important. Then why do they need my gpa??(if it\u2019s required)",

Also, think of it this way: say your portfolio is equally strong as this other person, and this other person also has a killer gpa, then the odds are they're gonna go with that person. So I'd actually reach out to an admissions officer, explain your circumstances, and ask them if it's going to be a big problem. Hope it works out!",

            "comment": "Hi! I graduated from cal arts as an Mfa. I can confidently tell you that your artwork means everything. If your portfolio is amazing they will accept you. On the application you have to put a gpa. It is required on all college applications as far as I know. The gpa is more of a technicality. The thing is undergraduates do have to be able to read and write well to communicate with the teachers. There are some classes for first year students that require studying and you do have to be a good student to understand what they are teaching you. \n\nHowever, do yourself a favor and make contact with those who handle the applications. They will usually remember you and if you ever are in California for a visit you can meet them. They are accessible and friendly. If they like your portfolio the grades won\u2019t matter very much.",

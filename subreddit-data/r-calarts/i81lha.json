    "postText": "I applied to the Character Animation Program back in January, but unfortunately didn\u2019t get in. I want to apply again for next year, but I have no idea where to begin with making a whole new portfolio. I don\u2019t know what I did right or wrong, I don\u2019t know if I was missing something, and I don\u2019t know what I need to improve on. So if anyone has the time, I\u2019d really appreciate some feedback on my portfolio and sketchbook. \n\nHere\u2019s the links if you\u2019re interested, and thanks for your time. \n\n[Portfolio](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YcHW5-wTDqCsMORqVZfFvnrVvPetgE5q)\n\n[Sketchbook](https://youtu.be/FqIgMsZBon0)",

            "comment": "I'm a music student but I was a fine artist and was close to becoming an artist as a career path out of high school. Take that as you will. First off, I wanted to say this is a really good sketchbook! There are things you certainly excell at and things you need to focus more of your energy on. I'll be focusing on the things you need to focus more on.\n\nSketchbook:\n\nHands are great, feet are great, figures are pretty good.\n\nLooking at your animal drawings, you should really incorporate the background of what you're drawing. For example, with the dogs and cats you drew (the ones that took one animal for one page) just has them floating in space. Ground them in reality, give them weight. Draw places you go to, places you hang out in, try and express what you like about those places and why you enjoy being there, what draws you to that place in particular??\n\nFor future sketchbooks, no more cartooning. CalArts isn't looking for your cartooning skills, that's what they want to teach you. They're looking for your understanding of foundation.\n\nAt 1:03, if there are tiles or things on the walls, draw them. If not, try to draw textures of the walls (unless it really is blank and has no texture to it). I'd also very much recommend against writing what you think (ex: \"I don't think he likes it here\", \"he eats mushrooms whole\"), you should try and show and convey that through your sketch.\n\nAt 1:23, I enjoy this one, but it feels like this one is a \"finished\" drawing, not a sketch. The lines look too perfect. It also looks like the figures were added in after the fact, not a part of the actual location you were drawing.\n\nSome of your pieces feel either incomplete or \"finished\" by adding things (that come across as less confident) in after the fact, especially for the more cartoony parts. Again, go against this by grounding what you draw in physical reality. If they're on a bark bench, don't just draw the bench, draw the trees, the grass, the sky, the clouds, the sidewalk, the scuffs on the sidewalk, the scuff on their coat, the mood of it all. Also, don't be afraid to use color.\n\nPortfolio:\n\nYour portfolio probably was hurt by the sheer amount of cartoons you submitted. The lions were good, the house was really really good! Don't submit hands and feet drawings for your portfolio, those should be for your sketchbook. Your portfolio should be more finished pieces.\n\nMy comment in a nutshell: no more cartoons or fantasy characters, more DETAILED life drawing (don't draw from pictures, draw from real life, they can easily tell the difference!), fill the page all the way up (ex. when drawing a dog, draw where he's sitting, what's around him, etc), more animal drawings, don't be afraid to use color. Get more detailed with your drawings, don't just draw simple line drawings, get into the details and explore them. Get better with faces (I know they suck, trust me, I hate drawing them). Watch accepted and other rejected sketchbooks and take note the differences.\n\nWell, you've made it to the end! I hope this helps! All this being said, don't feel bad you got rejected! Character animation has an acceptance rate of around 2%. Yes, you read that right, 2 measly percentage points!! Most of my friends (who are amazing artists) have applied 3-4 times with no luck. I only know of 1 or 2 people who applied straight out of high school and got in. I was lucky that I got in on my first apply (I was so certain I was going to be rejected, but the music department has way higher of an acceptance rate). Don't be afraid to try again! This is a great learning experience! You certainly DON'T suck or stink or whatever you're probably telling yourself. I've seen sketchbooks where they literally write in their damn sketchbook \"I know this sucks, but etc, etc, etc). Like... if you yourself say you suck, why should the person reviewing your work even continue? You have really strong areas that you should be proud of well as weak areas (like every single artist on the globe has!), you can easily take this year and work every day on what you need to in order to come back way stronger! Good luck!\n\nEDIT: Forgot to add, don't draw what you think CalArts is looking for, draw for yourself.",

            "comment": "Your drawing skills are fine but your sketchbook and portfolio are pretty monotonous. They didn't make me go wow. You don't experiment enough. It feels like you are using the same style in all your drawings. Also in your portfolio and your sketchbook there isn't enough variety. You draw like you are forced to, like you are studying it for someone else. It's too repressed. You need to let go and take risks because it's boring. I actually had to fast forward your sketchbook! I know this is a little harsh, but I hope next time you experiment more. Your sketchbook needs to show how you feel, it's not passionate",

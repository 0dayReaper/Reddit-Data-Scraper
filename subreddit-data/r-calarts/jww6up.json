    "postText": "Has anyone here gotten some good scholarships from CalArts? Im currently in school in Colorado looking to transfer into the ex pop music major. I honestly cannot really afford CalArts so I am praying I get some sort of scholarship. I put an ungodly amount of time into my portfolio so my fingers are crossed here. Wanted to see if anyone here has gotten some decent scholarships to afford school?",

            "comment": "CalArts provides almost all of its students with  scholarships. When they check your portfolio and eventually your work in class, if they like it they will pay for your tuition or part of it. \nFor example my first year when I went there cost 22,000. I was a normal student not the very best in school but competent. They paid 5,000 my first year and 11,000 my second and 15,000 my third year. So at the end of my 3 years I only owed 12,000 or so. The rest was covered by government loans. 3-5 students I believe got a full scholarship In their first and second years for outstanding work. So, it can be very expensive for some and others reasonable. \n\nJust make sure to really devote yourself to your work. It\u2019s such a short period of your life and you have your entire life to experience things outside of art. While your engaging in creative work remember to kept your head down and live for that art of only for a few years. It pays off later. Make friends too!  \n\nEdit:\n\nI forgot to mention that the students on the lower end of the merit scholarship get very little like 1-5,000. \n\nYou have to consider that this experience will cost some money and for some may not be worth it. \n\nSome people are talented enough that when they get to CalArts they have nothing to really learn. Instead it\u2019s a place for them to get noticed as an artist. Big companies, television stations, Netflix, ect all pay attention to CalArts grads.",

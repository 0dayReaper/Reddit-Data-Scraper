    "postText": "Hi,\n\nHow would I go about being admitted to the School of Critical Studies' MFA program, especially this late? They didn't mention the due date for admissions; I emailed some and plan on calling Monday.\n\nI was also wondering how \"multi-disciplinary\" it is? I know there's a written thesis, but I wonder if there's opportunities for learning exhibitions, dance performances/classes, and installations?",

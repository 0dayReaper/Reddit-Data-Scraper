    "postText": "These might be strange questions, but:\n\n1.) Are stickers allowed in sketchbooks? I have lots of tiny bunny stickers in mine from before I decided to try to apply.\n\n2.) Is it okay if we\u2019ve posted our sketchbook (and portfolio work) online before as long as we provide our social media accounts? \n\nI\u2019m guessing neither of these are great but wanted to make sure\n\nThank you!",

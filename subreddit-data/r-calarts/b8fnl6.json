I got rejected last year so I was kinda just preparing for the worst outcome.  applied to the experimental pop program last year but was told I was more suited for the music technology program in my audition lol. Didn\u2019t go very well. This year I got accepted to the music technology program and got a fat scholarship because they really liked my portfolio. So I guess it was meant to be lmao.",

There\u2019s allot of very talented artists that get snubbed by them. What annoys me more is the lack of funding and donations from companies like Pixar, google, Apple, etc that pull student straight from calarts. I know the school is very expensive to run so I\u2019m not sure how they will make tuition cheaper with the economy as it is. Hopefully they will figure something out. The new president has been very vocal and involved with the student government on trying to figure out ways to decrease the tuition.",

The only kids that can go to calarts are super rich kids. The school claims there is diversity but not economically. The majority are really rich kids and very poor kids who get scholarships. The in-betweens struggle to afford tuition. My boyfriend happened to be stuck in the middle and has ridiculous student debt now.",

Which it\u2019s pretty weird the degree plans are so similar for that and you\u2019ll have lots of classes with the BFAs too so there\u2019s kinda no difference in some ways. You may also want to look into Art and Technology or Fine Arts outside the music school, you could have your own studio and the music school doesn\u2019t have as many resources for their students. Not really sure your overall objective but they are all worth looking into. If you wanna program and make some hardware.",

But if you\u2019re good at what you do/ stand out you can get gigs through people you meet at school or on your own. Everyone there is different and trying to do different things. There are a lot of students there that ask themselves the same questions and have the same concerns. I think having experience before coming to the area is a big plus, or the ability to the thrive and learn quickly. You will learn a lot at once and you have to be passionate about it because it\u2019s a lot to take in. And yeah connect with people you want to work with at school but of course as much as possible in the real world through networking. You just gotta flip every opportunity into a couple and go from there until you increase the mathematic probability that you\u2019ll land a great job. It may not be right after school everyone is different, gigs for artist are all different. But yes, the school makes some efforts to help find employment but it\u2019s not entirely streamline.",

I\u2019ll just say this, I\u2019ve been called one of the lucky ones and I still can barely afford my bills and my student loans. I\u2019m behind with paying my loans actually because it\u2019s so hard for me. It\u2019s about to fuck up my credit and keep me from financing a house. Just being real. Not trying to shatter your hopes and dreams, it\u2019s really what you make of it. I say find what you\u2019re good at and run with it.  If you\u2019re good you won\u2019t need much help getting a job. You\u2019ll get emailed gigs from the music school but tbh I got an email about my current job when I was at the interview for it. So me seeing it first on LinkedIn gave me an advantage over my peers. Make a LinkedIn profile put in your skills and apply for jobs constantly. If you wanna do code at CalArts cool... but just remember when you actually apply for programming jobs after school, they aren\u2019t looking for engineers from music school, they are looking for programmers with computer science degrees. And I have seen folks learn that the hard way, I\u2019m seeing MFA students who can program but because they went to art school they arent able to compete with CS graduates. Music tech is still going to provide you with more employable skills. If you wanna leave CalArts and go make a bunch of money do graphic design or animation. Theater tech students also go on to do some good gigs. But I can\u2019t think of anyone from the music school living this extravagant lifestyle after school. Everyone I know is still pretty pay check to pay check. The best musicians I know are working at dispensaries and coffee shops between their gigs with jazz legends and getting taken on tour from time to time. A lot of the music tech classes are available on Kadenze.com - so that might be worth looking into. If you are an undergrad, start at a community college and save money. Or come here for a MFA.",

I've been applying to scholarships like there's no tomorrow with hopes of getting the cost of tuition as low as I can get it. $50,850/year is fucking insane. If you don't mind me asking, how fat is fat for you? I wouldn't consider what I got \"fat\", but it's certainly nothing to sneeze at. What department did you get into?",

The balance is still 4x what I'd pay for the state school I had previously decided on, but it was enough to make the difference and make me change my decision. I don't know if being a 3rd year transfer had any bearing on any aspect of the award, but I'm not about to second-guess it now. I'm also hammering hard on the private scholarships, because every bit helps. I'll be entering School of Music for Voice Arts.",

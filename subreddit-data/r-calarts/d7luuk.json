I highly recommend you come for a tour because that\u2019s what made/broke the deal for a lot of my peers.",

            "comment": "Like others have pointed out, depends which program you are in.\nI've started my 3rd year in character animation so here are my thoughts\n\n - \"Do you like Calarts?\"\n  Yes, 110%. For character animation, there are few places in the world that can match the quality of education and opportunities that you find here. In my year, 1/3rd to maybe 1/2 of us have already worked some kind of industry internship, is currently interning (my current situation), or has already been hired full time into the industry (cartoon network, disney, pixar, blue sky, dreamworks, etc). When you consider that the vast majority of people who study character animation in college rarely find gainful employment in \"the industry\", the fact that many of us have already worked in animation before 3rd year is pretty fucking impressive.\n\n - \"What are the flaws?\"\nCalarts is located in Santa Clarita, which is essentially a suburban hellscape. Its a safe city to be sure, but if you don't have any transportation, be prepared to be on or near campus for long stretches. People refer to this as being in the \"calarts bubble\". Steve's Cafe is. . . a mixed bag. Sometimes the food is good, often times, its not worth the price of the meal plan. On campus housing is alright. . . I've been lucky to have awesome roomates/suitemates, but your experience may vary. Last year, a quarter of the building (chouinard) had to be evacuated because sewage flooded an entire wing of it. To this day, my shower drain/sink still emits mystery smells, and not particularly pleasant ones. Also, my AC doesn't work so thats nice. I only live on campus because of the convenience TBH.\n\n - \"What do you love?\"\nWhere to start - Everyone in character animation is freakishly talented, so you will always be surrounded by people who will motivate/inspire you to grow as an artist. Since Calarts has recently made an effort to admit 'friendly' people, chances are good that you will pretty much get along with like 90% of people. In my year at least, I don't think there is any problem with bullying or cliques or anything like that. I've probably gotten drunk with most of my classmates lol, but lets keep than on the DL. And the professors - I can't praise them enough. They all genuinely care about the success of their students, and if you actively reach out to them, they will be happy to devote one on one time to help grow whatever your interests may be. The thing I appreciate the most about my professors is that they treat you like an adult and not a child - they give you the freedom to grow and the responsibility to actively work towards your own success. \n\n - Is it worth it?\n Speaking for myself. . .  Yes. . . mostly. Tuition just broke 50k last year and I would imagine many deserving people have probably been turned away because of that. But i'll tell you the honest truth about tuition - If you want to go to calarts bad enough, you WILL find a way to finance it, you just have to be resourceful and creative enough to find ways to get that money. I myself am from a working/middle class family from a middle income state. Despite not being some trust fund kid, I managed to fund 70% of my tuition thus far with scholarships or work. There are ways to fund college, you just have to be brave enough and creative enough to get your scholarship applications noticed. If you nurture and believe in your own ability to succeed, you pretty much will succeed - thats how I see it anyway and it's gotten me through thus far.\n\nWhew, that was long winded but yeah, I'm wishing you the best of luck! One last word of advice. . . The most successful students at calarts (and life in general) are the ones who genuinely enjoy making art, and see every new piece, project, or artwork as an opportunity to become better. If art-making is your greatest passion and your inner-most philosophy, the rest will follow naturally.",

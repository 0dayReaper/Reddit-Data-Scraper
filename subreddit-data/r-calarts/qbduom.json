    "postText": "Hello. I am Dante, but you can call me by my middle name Cameron. I am working on my Fall \u201822 application for the BFA program in Character Animation at CalArts and I barely started my portfolio. I used to quit constantly on every try but I feel brave and confident enough to draw again \u2014 even if my drawings and art doesn\u2019t turn out the way I expected them to be.\n\nMy long pose figure drawings and sketch drawings aren\u2019t the best but do they look for artwork that is exceptional or in this case, perfect?\n\nI never had any animation experience, but I had drawn comics and storyboards and character designs. Should I submit those?\n\nWhat about paintings, I\u2019m new to painting.\n\nPlease give me some advice in the comments below and I\u2019ll respond when I get a chance to. Thanks.",

            "comment": "I\u2019d keep long-form drawings to a minimum. The majority of figure drawings done at calarts is usually 1 minute to 5 minutes. You can submit a few long-form but the majority of your figures should be 1-5 min gestures\n\nHaving animation in your portfolio is a plus &amp; an advantage, but it isn\u2019t necessary. Anything broadly story related (comics, storyboards) are good. When I submitted my portfolio, my technical drawing wasn\u2019t amazing but I submitted a few animations/short-films, which was more of my strength. Broadly speaking, you should emphasize your strengths if possible.\n\nPainting, not necessary but if it is one of your strengths, it doesn\u2019t hurt\n\nIf you have any additional questions, I\u2019d be happy to answer!",

If you post a link to your portfolio/art, I\u2019d be happy to look it over\n\nAs far as general advice goes \u2026 If you want to work in animation eventually, it is good to think of animation as a process, or series of steps. You need character designers, storyboard artists, background painters, character animators, etc. You don\u2019t have to decide what exactly you want to be immediately, but it might be good to think about what appeals to you, then make the kind of art that makes you happy. A focused portfolio tends to have a better chance of getting through to schools, recruiters, studios, etc.\n\nSomething I notice about succesful or well known artists is that they tend to be playful or experimental with their work. Animation is entertainment, and interesting entertainment contains novelty, strange/new ideas and should surprise the audience. Likewise, you should apply novelty to your own work. For example, maybe you have sculptures of your characters. Maybe you paint with ketchup. Maybe you make animations with origami - literally any combination of things could be original or novel, and it is good to have novelty in your portfolios. You need to do something that separates your work from the 2000+ other applicants and catches the attention of whoever you are trying to convince.",

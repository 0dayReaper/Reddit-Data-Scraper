    "postText": "Hi, thank you so much for your help in advance. I have been developing my portfolio for the character animation program at Calarts for the past year or so now, but it's crunch time and I'm slowly realizing that I need more work than I thought. Yes, I realize my procrastination is my own downfall, but thing is I think I may need more time.\nOn Calarts' website, it says that the preferred deadline only has a lower application fee and decisions regarding acceptance will not be made earlier versus the regular deadline. Do any of you know if it would harm my chances of getting into the school if I applied regular decision instead of at the preferred deadline?\n\n(Preferred deadline is December 1st and regular decision is January 4th)\n\nThank you!",

    "postText": "Hi! Does anyone know if people in the film school have access to check out cameras and equipment for their shoots? Such as a 16mm or 35mm film video camera? \nOr is everything completely shut down on campus?\nThey aren\u2019t responding to my calls or emails. Please only respond if you have a helpful answer. Thank you \ud83c\udf3b",

    "postText": "Idk if this has been answered alr, probably but i\u2019ll ask anyways. Is there a certain type of art calarts prefers in a portfolio? or like a certain genre, style, anything? Or is it just like variation. Im a junior and have been thinking about applying (probs won\u2019t get in lol) but it seems so intimidating seeing their acceptance rate. Basically, how can I prepare my portfolio if I was thinking about applying? (I\u2019m interested in their EA course specifically but honeslty any advice is appreciated!)",

You can find examples probably on the Calarts website, and by browsing any of the Facebook groups for current students. I'm sure many of the members post their art on their profiles.",

    "postText": "Ok so I\u2019ve decided to apply to Calarts last minute and have been working hard to get all the work done. The only thing is the letters of recommendation. I\u2019ve contacted two art teachers of mine about writing them about a day ago (very late, I know \ud83d\udc80) and they haven\u2019t responded yet. So I was wondering do the completed letters have to be in by the deadline or will my application still go through even if I\u2019ve filled in the information of who will be giving the letter but they have not sent it in by the deadline.",

Seemed like portfolio mattered a lot more. \n\nSo I'd say tell the teachers you need them in ASAP but if they're late it doesn't mean your chances are 0.",

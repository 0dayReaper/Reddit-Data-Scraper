            "comment": "It is acceptable since pandemic has made live figure drawing much harder. Even some calarts life drawing classes have been and still are remote. So u could use onine sources, but I'd recommend generally avoiding using really famous, almost stock photo like pictures, such as those in the website Line of Action, bc it's too overused and the admission ppl can recognize them instantly. There are a lot models who do zoom life drawing sessions and stuff so start by looking for some of those!",

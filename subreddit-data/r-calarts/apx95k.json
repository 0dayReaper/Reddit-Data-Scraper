Right now there's nothing because I made it this morning, but after school I will edit it and add flairs and all that jazz. \nI will also provide a link to the official CSSSA discord soon. This subreddit is meant to help and encourage others in applying to CSSSA, and to share your applications and critique and/or give advice on to how you get in. You can also share your experience and advice socially in CSSSA. This subreddit is open to anyone interested in attending CSSSA!\n(Also if you don't know what CSSSA is, it's a 4 week residential program on the Calarts campus in Valencia, California. This is a life changing experience where you're immersed in your department, and it's very intense. The different departments are animation, creative writing, dance, music, theater, and the visual arts. \n\nThis is my link to the subreddit:https://www.reddit.com/r/CSSSA/\n",

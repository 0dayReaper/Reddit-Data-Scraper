            "comment": "I think mike mattesis method is amazing. He just gives you the general basic knowledge on how to see form. Style comes from building on top of that so i think you dont have to worry about that. You have to start from somewhere right? I mean you can get the same result but it will be a struggle figuring out by yourself instead of learning someones method",

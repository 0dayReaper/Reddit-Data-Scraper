    "postText": "as stated in my earlier post in this subreddit, i am planning to apply for the fall 2021 semester as calarts is the primary school that i am aiming for. just in case i do get rejected, i have artcenter and cca as my backup. anyways, i\u2019ve been preparing and collecting some of my works from 2018 up until now but i\u2019m still planning to add and reduce these. i\u2019ve been talking to a student over there and she stated that range is the most important thing to show. i know how difficult it is to get into the character animation program with their requirements and everything, so i want to ask if it\u2019s the same thing with graphic design students? i\u2019m trying to do my best to cater to what calarts needs in their portfolio, so i will still add more works that i still lack in (such as conceptual drawings and web design). \nif you would like, here are the works that i chose to show for the portfolio (again, this will be reduced):\n\n[rough portfolio](http://gum.co/eefan)",

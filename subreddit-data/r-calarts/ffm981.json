    "postText": "I was just accepted to the MFA composer program at CalArts. I\u2019m trying to find animators, filmmakers, story tellers who need scoring and/or sound design for their work. I\u2019ve got a firm understanding of scoring and arranging many musical styles as well as traditional musical devices in film. I\u2019m newer to sound design but can work in 5.1. I record and mix almost all my content.\nIf you\u2019re an animator or filmmaker attending CalArts 20/21 and you\u2019ve got ideas or projects that need music and sound then please reach out. Feel free to reply here or send me an email at redfieldclipper@gmail.com\nCalArts 20/21",

    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI was just admitted for graphic design, but I'm hesitant to attend because of the crazy tuition. I'm going to get some help from FAFSA and grants and I'm hustling for scholarships right now, but I doubt I'll be able to pay for this school without taking out loans. I've taken the option of being potentially six figures in the hole upon graduation off the table. My question is, are there any current students or recent grads who went without loans? How did you do it? Is everyone that goes already rich, or do they just figure the debt out later?\n\nI love the way their GD program looks--I have no doubt that I'd become a better designer and artist overall if I spend my time wisely and work really hard while enrolled. I just don't know that I'd get a good return on investment even if I left school as the best designer ever. I guess this is just me struggling to accept that high cost barrier for entry.",

            "comment": "is this for MFA or BFA? because that makes a huge difference. I'm waiting to hear back about their film/video MFA program and am nervous about the cost as well. My profs in undergrad taught me to always go to the grad program that's free for you, and honestly I think they're right. I had the privilege of not having loans for undergrad, but I'll have no parental support with my master's. I am thinking that i will end up at University of Memphis (where I'm from) which is still a great program, but I'll probably get paid to go there. I also really liked the professors I met there. From what I understand, in the future, no one cares where your actual degree is from, especially in the artist world. I would pay attention to cost vs. community vs academics... sorry for the ramble",

I think the only program I'd choose over CalArts is UCLA's Design Media Arts. I applied for UCR, UCSD, and UCSC, but the programs there aren't as strong as UCLA or CalArts after looking at student work. It's a complex decision for sure.",

Got approved for subsidized and unsubsidized loan from the federal government to help out.\nGoing to this school without any help is extremely dumb cause even people with money applied for FAFSA and got grants. \n\nCalArts isn\u2019t a school about making you a better designer. It\u2019s a school that gives you a space to be a become a better artist. The connections you make here don\u2019t hurt either.",

I watch these videos on youtube of both accepted and rejected sketchbooks but their similarities outweigh their differences so I am left confused on what Calarts really wants in the end. I'm willing to do anything to get in but it's hard when you dont know what they want in its entirety. Could y'all educate me on what it takes to have \"a winning sketchbook\" so I can get in.",

Life drawing.\n\nI've seen a lot of the same videos you have, and while I'm blown away by how creative and colorful some people are, Calarts is always going to be most impressed by life drawing. If you're not already going to live model sessions, start immediately. Bowls of fruit, statues, animals, etc. Everything else being equal you can't have too much drawing from life.",

            "comment": "There are a lot of variables when it comes to admissions. Essays, portfolio, sketchbook, letters of rec, etc. So as someone said on their comment, it is not just about the sketchbooks. \n\nThat being said, sending a physical sketchbook IS a huge and unique part of Calarts admission process. I'd say although Calarts does look at the portfolios first in order to screen the \"unworthy\" applicants, (if someone looks incompetent in fundementals such as anatomy, perspective, color use, they wouldn't rlly look at the person's sketchbook I heard) sketchbooks are the make-or-break point in the process.\n\nI, too, have seen a lot of sketchbooks on yt and although I was confused at the decisions time to time as well, I began to gradually understand them better. Most successful sketchbooks I saw had their own voice when it comes to art. Whether it be their style, the subject matter, or the thought process they put in, there are something very unique about each one of them. This cannot be achieved by simply looking at other applicants' sketchbooks-it is accomplished through making several sketchbooks yourself, trying and failing at different styles and medium, and studying the works of masters, such as James Jean's, not looking at your fellow applicant's who may or may not have gone to Calarts mere 2 yrs ago.\n\nI still am sometimes confused to see a great sketchbook get waitlisted or rejected though. It's anyone's guess the reasons for it, because art is highly subjective. Calarts does favor American citizens over international students during their app process, so that could be one factor. But as I said, instead of trying to figure out what worked and didn't work for other applicants, spend the time figuring out what works for YOU. That's what ultimately gets u in the door. I wish you all the best with ur application!!",

            "comment": "Ok this is something an administration rep told me but 80% of the time the sketchbooks don\u2019t get looked at. If you\u2019re portfolio ain\u2019t good then they don\u2019t look at your sketchbook. That\u2019s why there are rejected sketchbooks that are insanely good that makes you question \u201cwhy didn\u2019t they get accepted?\u201d. The order they look at the applicants stuff is the order that\u2019s shown on the application requirements on the website (1. Artist statement 2. Portfolio and video intro 3. Sketchbook) \n\n(The Video Intro is to just to see what you look like. Puts a face to the name and stuff)\n\nAlso they want to see people in environments and interacting with it rather than just drawings of different people. \n\nCalarts is really great art school but to make sure you don\u2019t stress out and end up trying to imitate other applicants or those calarts sketchbook on YouTube, you\u2019re gonna have to just see it as another art school you\u2019re applying to.",

    "postText": "Okay since Ive gotten sent that cursed link (calarts hub one), Its always said smth like \"All documents complete\". \nSo I went onto my Fin Aid thing on the  3rd of March and out of no where is says \"Complete required documents\"!!! I click on it ofc to see whats needed and they asked for a \"dependent verification\" form and my mothers tax returns. \n\nEvery school ive applied to didnt want that info till AFTER acceptance. Also, my fafsa is up to date and accepted. ALSO, i go to my checklist thing where it says \"youre financial aid is being reviewed\" and then you click on it and says YOU CANT VEIW AT THAT THIS TIME!! instead of not available + like 3 more tabs on my fin aid popped up showing me an overview of my \"tuition and fees\". It was uploaded today,,,and im like,,,,,what the fuck does this mean,,,i have a check list thing,,, I have a student ID,,,It has my \"Federal Work study\" stuff. So yea,,,,,,i dont know what to do. \n\n* I did call the school on the 3rd when everything FIRST started but they said financial aid is different from acceptance,,,but that doesnt make any sense,,,,why would you go through the trouble if someone isnt accepted?? idk. Ima keep trying to tell myself this ISNT anything special,,,but oh my god",

    "postText": "I'm certainly not going to be applying to Calarts because I'm poor as hell, but I do keep an eye on big-name animation colleges in case an oppurtinity arises and I can't help but notice this year that what I thought were dynamic and spot on sketchbooks have been rejected. Is it cause of COVID? Does Calarts have an overflow of too many students applying or are there plenty of students already? Have the standards risen? Or am I overthinking things?\n\nHere are some that I thought would make the cut but got the boot:\n\n[https://youtu.be/Jz8QomJ6Iw4](https://youtu.be/Jz8QomJ6Iw4)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOUbNQdKBb0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOUbNQdKBb0)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsdHqMv8Bbg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsdHqMv8Bbg)\n\nlooking back on these sketchbook's now I can see their flaws, but still interested to see what people have to say!",

It seems like thats what most colleges say every year to their applicants \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 From what I heard, they actually had a smaller number of applications this year: usually they recieve somewhere in between 1k~2k apps for Character Animation, but apparently this year they only got a little short of 1k. \n\nThe class size really depends on the upper classes, it appears. If the upper classes are on the bigger size, they would accept less ppl and vice versa, so that they could maintain a constant number of students in the program. This is of course a speculation tho.\n\nBut I agree, those sketchbooks and some others are simply just too good to be rejected. I was esp shocked to see this person getting rejected as well.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/VaVEDyg4Ytg",

They can be easily overlooked. They look flawless and boring. They don't give a glimpse to the people who created them.",

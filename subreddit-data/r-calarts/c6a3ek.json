    "postText": "Hello! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI graduated from CalArts in 2015 with my BFA major in art and a minor in creative writing. I'm now at Brown getting my masters in poetry. Please ask me questions! I have a low key job right now and plenty of time! I went to a public high school and took art media, life drawing, and art AP. But! CalArts **does not care about grades**! I can't speak for other programs, but the art program looks at your portfolio and reads your essay. They are looking for individuals that think for themselves. The art program usually does not have any life drawing students because the art program is focused on concept, not production. CalArts will not provide much structure regardless of the program, if you're a person that needs strict structure I advise you look elsewhere. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to message me as well!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nXOXO",

But you can always talk to the instructor! Exceptions are always made. I'd get a degree in whichever one you want to study closest or get the most feedback on. Since graduating I've worked at tons of different art-related places, from MOCA to independent run artist spaces and cataloged a family's art collection. Whether or not you get a job is up to you, some students are trust fund babies while others come into school still working full-time. I always had at least 2-4 jobs on campus while I was there: the art office, the super shop, and the coffee shop. Also, a great way to meet people across the disciplines! I started working outside of school during my third year and had gigs set up after I graduated until I found a permanent job. If you have a specific job in mind, you're prob solid! If you're flip-flopping around, you'll have time during school to narrow down what you want to do post-grad. I hope that helped a lil!",

It's a great way to get close to a faculty member you really like/trust/want feedback from. First year doesn't do independent studies for the most part because they don't know all the faculty yet. Your second year you choose your mentor, but you can always change. I had 3 different mentors over 4 years. You meet with your mentor as much or as little as you like. The teachers, normally, are very anti-authoritarian and approachable yet the right amount of intimidating in regards to their professional lives.",

If you want your work to be talked about conceptually, CalArts is the place. If you want a crit about the brush strokes or the color or the type of canvas whatever then CCA or SFAI might be more up your alley. Fuck what the teachers and students like! If that's how you work, that's how you work! A lot of MFAs are strictly painters with more figurative work because they come from less conceptual backgrounds. The art program loves new ideas and concepts, but when students don't do their homework in art history and repeat things that have already been done, they get bored. Old thing with new approach, nice! Old thing with exact same approach, the students and faculty will not be shy to let you know lol.",

Most people were between 20 and 28, there have been 40 year old first years and 17 year old first years. I'd imagine you'll be very comfortable! A bunch did have community college credit coming in or attended some other school. During second year we had like 6 transfer students come in. There's always people coming and going for better or for worse. I've noticed in the last couple of years that more fresh high school students are in the art program but most of them don't last long lol. The program changes dramatically all the time which I think is a huge plus. I do love the faculty there and wouldn't of gone to any other school. Faculty will give you as much as you give them, be an honest and straight forward person and you'll have flying colors!",

I recently got to visit the school and really liked what they had to offer, but I did not get to see the scene shop. Did you happen to know anyone who went through the program with this major and if so, what they thought of it? Thanks in advance!",

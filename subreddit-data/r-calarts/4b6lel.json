Those classes are usually set up for you to build a college portfolio.\n\nIn terms of your drawing skills \u2013 the main thing is to embrace your idiosyncrasies. Not all great artists possess the same technical pension for photo-realism, because that's not what makes their work great. I'm not saying that you don't have to practice leaving your comfort zone, but I'm saying that you shouldn't get too caught up on the way things are \"meant\" to look. Someone at CalArts during my interview day gave me the best advice \u2014 \"do things on purpose\"... accentuate how you draw your cartoons now, make them look that way on purpose and try to find beauty in that.\n\nThe college application process is tough, but you're lucky to have the freedom to express yourself as an artist through your portfolio, rather than just through faceless, multiple choice, machine-graded questions! Good luck!",

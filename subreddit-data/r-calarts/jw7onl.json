    "postText": "Hello! I was wondering if anyone that has transferred into Calarts has successfully transferred in as anything past a BFA1 / Freshman, especially as a Character Animation student. I seem to have only ever heard that if you transfer in, you\u2019re almost guaranteed to start as a BFA1 regardless of how much time you\u2019ve spent at other schools, and you\u2019re required to take the full 4 years for their BFA in Character Animation. On the Calarts website it claims that the school accepts credit from colleges and universities, but I want to know how reliable that has been for the students actually going through Calarts curriculum. \nThank you in advance :.)",

That being said, a lot of non-major elective courses, i.e. general education courses, do transfer over. So you do get some time opened up as you have fulfilled those credits, which are required for graduation. This allows you to focus more on your major courses, work more on your film, do internships, etc.",

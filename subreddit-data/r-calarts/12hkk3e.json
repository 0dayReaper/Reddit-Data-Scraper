Rather than strictly stay in SCV or Newhall, try Mount Washington too (lots of Calartians there) or Val Verde (but you\u2019ll need a car).\n\nYeah, the desk is bolted into the wall already and comes with the hardest wooden chair you\u2019ve ever experienced. Comes with the closet space of a budget transcontinental flight. A tiny book shelf for 3 objects maximum. You\u2019ll also be sharing one bathroom/shower with 5 other people\u2026 co-ed style.\n\nBut I also have some amazing memories there too. I can share those if there\u2019s interest still.",

Just now I was browsing the application for housing and I can choose single gender or inclusive gender now.\n\nThe places you mentioned aren\u2019t familiar to me yet because I\u2019m an international student. For now, all I know is the Ahmanson and Monticello, I should do some research on the off-campus guide. Thanks for offering some clues!\n\nAfter comparing the prices, I'd say the comfort or enough space go with a much higher budget. The rent itself can double, not to mention all trivial costs like water, utilities, traffic, etc.  I think my strategy is to stay on campus for the first year and see if I want to move out. So it would be lovely to hear about your good memories giving me some hope!! \ud83d\ude0a",

Living immediately on campus will mean rules like curfew and music limits past a certain time. It may also mean dance parties and secret campus bars.\n\nI always walked to a nearby computer lab and stayed there until midnight and walked back to ahmanson without any issue. You can also get groceries and errands on trips into Valencia with your dorm mates. \n\nGranted these are 2013-2014 figures but I managed to find a room with other Calartians off campus for $500/month including utilities. That came later once people got to meet me and I discovered the area a bit.\n\nInterestingly enough, I met my wife while living in the room mentioned above and we had our first dates walking in a park near Walnut St.",

And do you need to buy other furniture because the school website says it's unfurnished. \n\nAlso, can I ask how to commute? do you need a car? (again website says it's a 10-minute car distance) I'm an FDP student and was told to owe a car for shooting, but the context of the advice isn't based on Santa Clarita, so I wonder if I should consider the budget for a car. \n\nThanks so much for your time!",

But if you do want to take the bus to go elsewhere, the main bus station is also just a 1-minute walk away. Most people I know who live here didn't bother getting a car and just take the shuttle/bus.\n\nNote: there's some drama around CalArts not being sure they'd offer the shuttle next year (the students are petitioning) so I'd keep an eye out for that though.\n\nHope this helps :)",

Anyway, hope they better not stop the service.\n\nI still have some detailed questions. Can I ask how much you pay for housing every month, including water, utilities, gas, and everything? Because it shows 1300$ but also says it's a minimum. \n\nAnd, I asked the residence office about the possible additional fees for housing during the summer holiday. They said they don't offer housing during the summer, just September to May. So do you have to rent some other place if you stay around the school in the summer? \n\nThank you for your time :))",

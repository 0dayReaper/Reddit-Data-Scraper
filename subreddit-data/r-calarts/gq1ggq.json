    "postText": "I was accepted to CalArts as a transfer student for Acting earlier this month. Having a strong alumni network and connections to the jobs is very important to me in my college decision. Currently, I plan on attending either CalArts or NYU. \n\nHow is the CalArts acting network? Those who are attending or have attended, what is/was your experience like? I unfortunately have never been on campus either so I am making this decision based off of pictures and videos. Any info on the campus and student life would be cool too!",

            "comment": "It's a solid network. If you're good, people will know and support you. There's some solid alum, not just in theatre but all the other performing/visual arts worlds. Similar circles. \n\nBut a big difference between NYU and CalArts is that with NYU you're in the heart of the city with everything in that world to choose from. At CalArts you're on an island (Santa Clarita is removed from LA, a car is necessary) packed with wildly creative people. Beyond the regular class and performance load you'll have a ton of side projects (plays, media, films, music, performance art, writing, etc.) to do. If you're self-motivated you will have a full, full three years and emerge a much better ... whatever you want to be.\n\nIf you're committed to your discipline you'll make connections that matter.",

What I mean by that is you really don\u2019t get many opportunities to leave the campus for  school work. This is really depending on what you want to be involved in though. Many students involve themselves in there own projects that take place on campus and off campus. But the school is going to avoid sending you off campus to work on projects unless it\u2019s part of a community outreach or they are going to have the show go to a theatre in DTLA.\n\nAnd that\u2019s really the only reason I would pick NYU imo. Both schools are going to have their own advantages and disadvantages when it comes to the program, but the environment is going to be very different. You go from NYU being in one of the busiest city in the world to CalArts being in the part of LA that people go to get away from LA.",

            "comment": "I was faced with that exact decision you're making and personally  feel that I made 100% the right call going to CalArts instead. What studio were you put in to for NYU? (that will dictate your first 2 years' experience and I may be able to offer insight into how it will be different or similar. The other commentators have talked about location and I agree a car is necessary in a big way but I knew I wanted to live and work in LA so it was worth it to me to be here instead. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPersonal opinion/anecdote: NYU loves to non-stop talk about their alumni and their alumni network, however, I know several BFA graduates who have told me that amounts to them just caring about their name and not caring about their students. You will have to network and make connections yourself, they will not do it for you.",

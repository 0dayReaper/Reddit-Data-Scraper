    "postText": "Hi there!!! I\u2019m looking to apply to get into some of the extended studies classes and I was checking out the requirements to apply for said classes. They say life drawings, but I was curious as to whether or not they would accept digital life drawings? I mainly draw on my IPad Pro on Procreate, but if that\u2019s not what they are looking for I would be more than happy to break out the old pen and paper. \n\nThoughts???\n\ntldr: Does calarts accept digital life drawings on their extended studies applications?",

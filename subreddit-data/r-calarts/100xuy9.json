    "postText": "I'm a little confused on what they mean when it says that composite images aren't accepted (I'm applying to the Experimental Animation program). I have a couple of sculptures that I'm including and I want to display the different views/angles. Other colleges I'm applying to allow me to compile the different angles in one photo. I usually use 3-4 total. One main photo and the other 2-3 are smaller but in the same image. Is calarts implying that this isn't allowed?",

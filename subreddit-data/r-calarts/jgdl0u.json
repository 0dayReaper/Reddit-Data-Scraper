    "postText": "I've heard somewhere that CalArts is more inclined to accept an applicant based on social media, how big of a platform they have, their connections, etc... If that's the case, I don't think that's right. I mean we're talking about pre-college individuals here. On top of that, there are many artists not on social media who would give a lot of these Instagram artists a run for their money. I currently don't have an Instagram, not saying I would never create one... but as a pre-college student that has to focus on many other aspects of life, I don't find it necessary as I apply to college (on top of it being very distracting.) That's my question, do I need social media to get into the character animation program at CalArts, and are there people currently enrolled who do not have one?",

I do suggest you eventually invest in a website or portfolio site. It\u2019s not social media so that pressure of frequent uploads/communication isn\u2019t there but you still have a professional space to house your work and share a bit about yourself.\n\nAlso yes, I have classmates who don\u2019t use social media.",

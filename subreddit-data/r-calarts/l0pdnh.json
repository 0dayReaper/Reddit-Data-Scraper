    "postText": "Hello! Basically the title; I love art and have been wanting to apply to CSSSA animation for a while, but I'm in your average public high school and have never been to any special art classes or courses. I haven't even been to any figure drawing classes (I find all of my figure drawing references online), and I'm worried this will affect my chance of getting accepted. (I'm a freshman and my art isn't particularly special as well, so I don't expect to get in regardless.) Do you think this will affect my chances of getting in? Thank you!",

            "comment": "I will be a freshmen next year and I think they mainly care about how good your art is I mean taking classes and stuff would probably be useful but If you can't just practice a bunch I think they like realism so I would recommend trying to get that down also if you really want in don't have the attitude that you won't get accepted have the attitude that if you put in enough effort you will :D I don't know if this is too helpful or not but whatever also I really wanna go to Calarts so I am trying to spend lots of time improving my art and writing skills (cuz I want in animation)",

    "postText": "Hi :)\n\nI'm 28 year old and I do freelance.\n\nI'm international student and I had postponed studying abroad because it is financially burdensome.\n\nI can afford to study abroad now, so I've been trying to enter calarts since last year.\n\nI applied calarts character animation program,\n\nand I got rejected twice in a row :(\n\nFirst time I got the mail that they want me to reapply after 1 year artistic development,\n\nDuring this time, I drew a lot and I thought myself my art become improved, so I thought calarts might accepted me this time.\n\n(Now that I think about it, it could have been a complacent idea LOL)\n\nThe reason I was so sure about my portfolio was because, I talk with the assistant director of admissions, and he said my portfolio was so good. \n\nSo I had no worries about admission, and now I got rejected. AGAIN!\n\nI mailed to school give me some advices, but still no answer about it. but I'll wait. \n\nBut I can't just wait, so I need your opinions.\n\nDoes anyone give me some advices of my portfolio who working in animation industry or calarts alum or enrolled student?\n\nI'll share my g-drive link. \nThere's two section of 2022, 2023. \nPlease comment me with reply.\n[Portfolio](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DSB1aZwZVN61m302o-7QT93a30s25xyc)\n\nAnd I something want to know a few things, \n\n\n* Is admission have cases that restricted because of age to give younger students a chance?\n* Is it common in calarts that rejected in a row?\n* I really want to enter calarts because it is my dream school, but could it be foolish to insist on one school?\n\nThe reason why I insist on calarts is that I want to learn from it because it is a school of the best directors, and above all, I think there will be many opportunities to get an internships and job.\n\nYour opinion is very important because there is no place to ask for advice. Please leave a comment! :)",

            "comment": "Hi, so sorry for ur rejection. But do keep in mind that yes, it is common to get rejected many times in a row. Some ppl get in after 3rd or 4th try. Also age doesn't matter in CalArts admissions. There are many students in there mid to late 20s and even 30s in character animation. Also, i would always take the admission ppl's words with a grain of salt cuz ultimately, they are not the ones making the decisions- the faculty members are. I don't feel comfortable leaving my email address here but if u wanna pm me ur portfolio i could take a look!\n\nAlso also-- going to Calarts does not guarantee an internship opportunity. Internships are so scarce and it's much much harder to get than an actual entry level job. The school u go to doesn't matter much, ur portfolio and resume do. I've seen a lot of talented artists from other schools such as Ringling and USC get internships from big studios, so if that's ur ultimate goal, def look into some other options too",

There\u2019s tons of amazing artist that wants that approximately 50 spots at CalArts Animation each year and the students basically are talented to begin with but its that \u201c uniqueness \u201c on how they express their art/ passion in a more \u201c experimental \u201c way is what makes them different than the rest. They seem to wanna create future storyboard / directors of animatioms and all that stuff that the Industry wants. Goodluck again !",

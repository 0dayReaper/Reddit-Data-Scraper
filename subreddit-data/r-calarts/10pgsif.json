    "postText": "So my goal is to run my own animation studio and create my own animated series. Think invincible or some anime esc series. Ik it's a ambitious goal but would calarts be a good fit. I ve seen that a lot of nickelodeon and cartoon network style stuff associated with calarts so will I be limited to that?\n\nAlso I plan on attending lcad first since I'm still learning and not ready for how selective calarts is.should I get a bachelor's in lcad then transfer into the mfa program for art in calarts? Or do two years lcad and finish in calarts.",

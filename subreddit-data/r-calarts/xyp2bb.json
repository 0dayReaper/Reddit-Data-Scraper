            "comment": "Hello, I was a jazz drums masters student so I have a bias towards the jazz program but calarts has a place for ya somewhere. Calarts values original music so make sure to include stuff you\u2019ve made/composed in your portfolio, arrangements are ok too. They mostly want to see that you\u2019re driven and are putting your best foot forward. There are many programs to consider within the music school, jazz, music tech, experimental pop, performer/composer. All of these specialties have different mentors which is where I\u2019d put the most importance. Hope this helps, I\u2019d email teachers and anyone you can to get more of a feel about the school. Go visit too if you\u2019re close, go on Thursday and stay for gallery nights :)",

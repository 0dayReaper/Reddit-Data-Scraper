    "postText": "I didn't get to apply to any schools with a January deadline because of medical stuff that stretched on from the end of junior year to the beginning of senior year in high school (terrible timing). I did get to apply for some animation schools with later deadlines (SVA, CCA, and Ringling for Illustration), as well as affordable city and state schools. Now I have the option to go to SVA for about $6000 a year after a scholarship and grants, which is way more affordable than I anticipated. I also have the option to go to a liberal arts city school (a CUNY) for free. I know that SVA offers great opportunities, but I don't connect with the school's vibe, campus, or a lot of the student work, and I know that many of the people I knew and would like to avoid will be there. These aren't the most concrete or \"logical\" reasons, but they still weigh on me. \n\nWhat do you think I should do in the upcoming year? Go to SVA and apply to transfer if I don't like it? Go to the CUNY, regroup, and improve my portfolio while gaining college credits before transferring to an animation school? Or take a gap year to work while developing a sketchbook and portfolio? I'd really appreciate any advice you could give me.",

            "comment": "I wanna point out that while Calarts accepts general education transfer credits, they do not waiver your major art courses even if you took them at another art school. So you'd need to attend full 4 yrs even if you transfer in, unless you drop out after couple yrs. In that regard, I'd recommend going to a school that will cost you the least if Calarts is still in the picture for you. I personally went to an art school where I learned a good deal in fundementals and improved quite a lot, which helped me when I was putting together my portfolio for Calarts. But I agree with the other comment; don't go to a school if you don't like anything about it. If you have to endure a year in such environment it might not only affect ur mental and physical health but also reflect on your portfolio. If you have any questions on transferring feel free to pm me! Good luck!",

I\u2019d say you could go to that school offering you a free ride, you could get general requirements done which would make Calarts, or whatever school you end up transferring to, cheaper when you apply later.",

Ewe drumming is awesome and ancestral to Haitian drumming, so I never thought I would learn either.  \n\nI am a huge fan of soca, reggae, original calypso, jazz, south African jazz, Ethiopian music, original zouk, afro jazz, afro beat, hilife, Cuban jazz, mandinka, sabar, Bata, soukouss, and rumba, Bomba and plena\n\nI don't know why I didn't figure this out when I was 15 or 25, but hey if I can have a viable goal of working with my teacher for a portfolio to audition, then hey maybe I get to learn this music at a higher level.\n\nThanks\n\nAnyone here into that stuff?\nI was thinking of contacting faculty but am historically bad at writing to people,",

My situation is rough",

I can tell you love this art deeply and if you've been playing for this long and have had the aid of a private teacher, I'm sure you're pretty good at it by now. It's better to try now and fail than to never try and wonder if you could have done it.\n\nDisclaimer I didn't go to CalArts but I almost applied and I went to the summer program CSSSA for music a while ago. I think the music programs at CalArts are all wonderful and I'm sure it's one of the best academic programs in the world for this style of music.\n\nThat said, I don't think you'd really want to attend this school if you're in a tough spot financially and mentally, and if you're really banking on attending this program to make it as a professional hand-drummer. Along with being one of the best programs it is also notoriously one of the most expensive and the cost of attendance only rises each year.\n\nI'm not a percussionist but I am a working musician and I can tell you that most of the good drummers and pop-percussionists I know of don't have any degree whatsoever. Especially if you already have a teacher, it would be much easier, inexpensive, and probably about 85% as effective to just continue to learn on your own with a good private teacher then to go into **enormous** debt attending a private school for hand drumming.\n\nThat said there are lots of great general music programs that happen to also have African drumming ensembles, especially in California, so if you truly want to start working as a performing and/or recording musician it may be helpful to gain more general music knowledge and skills. It'd also probably be beneficial to acquaint yourself with other kinds of percussion in general including the ones seen in orchestra and concert bands. From what I've seen, the percussionists who get the gigs are the ones who really do their best to be as versatile and proficient in as many instruments and styles as possible.\n\nOf course, take everything I say with a grain of salt cause it's your life and ultimately you know better for yourself than any stranger on Reddit could. I hope this was helpful to you and I wish you all the best in your endeavors :)",

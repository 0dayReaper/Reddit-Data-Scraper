    "postText": "Hi everyone, I'll be in CalArts next semester and I can get a room in Ahmanson Hall. But, for approximatively the same price, I found a room in Altadena, where the girl who owns the apartment can rent me her car. I wondered if it was really better to live on campus or if you would more recommend living outside. Thanks!",

You really gotta ask yourself if you want to commute 1.5-2 hours every time you want to go to campus! (Considering the price of gas right now, that's a fuck-ton of money down the drain imo)",

I still have flashbacks about how soul-crushingly small the beds were. \n\nThat said, you will have an academic edge living on campus and being 1-2 minutes away from everything. You can go to JJ\u2019s, bike to Newhall, etc. and still have an active nightlife. \n\nAltadena is far from everything unless you have kids.",

With the Pell grant and SEO grant on top, my total aid is $33k/year. I maxed out on federal loans ($9.5k for my freshman year) and will have to pay about $10k a year for tuition after all the aid and federal loans if I attend. Hope this helps!\n\nEDIT: When I went to the Financial Aid meeting this weekend, they said the Equity Grant (which caps out at $20k) is based on your FAFSA and EFC (mine was 0 and I make less than $30k a year) OR CSS Profile if you're an international student. The Access Grant (no upper limit) is distributed by each school (Art/Film &amp; Video, etc.) in accordance with their diversity requirements. The last type of aid provided by CalArts is the Merit scholarship, based on portfolios and awarded to the top 30% of incoming applicants that caps out at $10k/year.",

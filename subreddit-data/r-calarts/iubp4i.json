    "postText": "I applied to CalArts for the fall 2020 Graphic Design MFA program, got accepted, and got awarded a total of 28k in scholarships/financial aid. Based on their calculations, iirc, I would still owe 24k to cover the tuition alone, before thinking about any kind of living costs. I decided not to go because I really can't afford to take on that much debt for a graduate degree (which is such a voluntary degree to begin with) and also the pandemic hit, making it seem even more irresponsible to go into such debt when I might not even be benefitting from the full experience of grad school. I'm planning on reapplying for fall 2021 in hopes of getting more scholarship, but I'm wondering if there even IS more scholarship/financial aid to receive. Would love any insight on this!",

That being said, yes, they require portfolios and you are automatically considered for any need or merit-based scholarships/financial aid when you submit your application.",

I've been hearing some rumblings of Cal Arts in serious financial problems and some programs being shut down altogether... I know of one department that had 11 on staff and is down to 3 now.. the rest have been let go",

            "comment": "I\u2019m currently in music tech and It\u2019s really good.... buttttt there needs to be more modernization of the music school and it\u2019s resources. Like more studio space for production and contemporary music. Everyone is a laptop producer in some capacity now regardless of genre. There are currently only 3 studios and only 2 of those are for BFA students. The studios get fully booked within 1-2 days after the schedules are posted. So it kinda fucks everyone who doesn\u2019t have their own version of a recording setup. I\u2019ve suggested even putting speakers with an Aux chord into all the practice rooms to help this problem in some capacity. \n\nAllot of our issues come from a lack of funding. The best funded program in the music school has to be the jazz program because of their direct connections to the philharmonic and their pattern of getting musicians picked up in the industry. It seams the school is always creating opportunities for traditional musicians and composers but doesn\u2019t really offer as much to people participating in contemporary and pop music. So as a result kids in music tech and xpop programs kinda feel like the neglected step children of the music school lmao. \n\nThere are still ALLOT of great opportunities for all student when it comes to learning, preforming, composing etc. but I think there could be more done by staff to update things and keep it fresh.\n\nSomething that\u2019s been discussed allot between my friends and other students is creating a bigger social media presence online. The animation school has a huge online presence with their films, sketchbooks, etc. but the music school has almost zero when it comes to advertising student work or projects. Usually what is pushed is the Jazz, orchestral, or experimental stuff. Which is really cool but not what exactly grabs attention in 2020. The quarantine has kinda forced them to start looking at ways to share student work online more frequently and as a requirement for classes which I love! I\u2019m currently in collaborative ensemble and the teachers are trying new methods like playlists consisting on work from music tech, xpop, and collaborative ensemble which consists more of contemporary music. \n\nOverall I think the program is great and the theory is really detailed and rigorous. You get out of it what you put in.",

                    "comment": "&gt;So it kinda fucks everyone who doesn\u2019t have their own version of a recording setup.\n\nLuckily I set up a recording \"studio\" in my room (laptop connected to electric keyboard) so that I don't have to deal with signing out times for recording and getting out of the way to let people who need it use it. Something else that I have major problems with is the amount of practice rooms. There are only around 10-11 practice rooms and the rest are major-specific practice rooms. It's kind of ridiculous. At my old community college we had over 40 air-conditioned practice rooms. I know it's the way the building is built, but I wish they put funding into creating a bungalow of practice rooms right outside or something. It's ridiculous when I have to meet with a group, you have to get their stupid early or not be able to practice (if you need the piano).\n\nFunny you mention collaborative ensemble. I was in it last semester but was having such a difficult time finding a band to join, our bands kept breaking up due to scheduling issues to the point where I dropped it. Also I wasn't really a fan of the Monday morning class meeting at all. Found out after I dropped it that it's a required course that you have to take 3 times. Fuck. How's that class working over Zoom?\n\nAnd yes, Rob's theory classes are some of the most demanding theory classes I've ever taken. He really cares about you learning theory. Information overload at times but worth it.",

                            "comment": "Yesss they really need to build a extension to the main building that\u2019s just practice rooms and studio space. Or maybe re designate some of the art school space to the music school. They have whole rooms that sit empty for whole semesters that never get used. I know the schools are very territorial about their space and property so I doubt that would happen. But u know. Calarts is a \u201ciNtErDiCiPlInArY\u201d school \n\nCollab ensemble is actually sick on zoom. My band already recorded 3/5 of our tracks for our EP so we\u2019re kinda in a good place. It sucks because we can\u2019t properly record due to who has access to what equipment. But we can defiantly finish everything remotely. We do have to play our tracks over zoom in shitty quality but it\u2019s fine lol. We have to submit them like once a week for the online public playlist now tho. \n\nWe also found out that Eyvind is really into PC music now and is talking to AG Cook about coming to the school next semester to do a lecture or small class. So I\u2019m hyped af for that.",

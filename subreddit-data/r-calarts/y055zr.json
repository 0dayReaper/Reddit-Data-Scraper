    "postText": "I\u2019m looking to apply to CalArts and I\u2019ve started my sketchbook but the markers I\u2019m using (Alcohol) keep bleeding through the paper on the other side. I don\u2019t want whatever I make on the other side to look bad/sloppy, so I\u2019ve tried finding other sketchbooks and even painting the other side of the paper with white paint.\n\nIs this bad? What markers should I be using and what kind of sketchbook should I get? Is it my markers? If I\u2019m gonna showcase storyboarding and background art then I don\u2019t want it to bleed on the other side. \n\nAny advice helps!",

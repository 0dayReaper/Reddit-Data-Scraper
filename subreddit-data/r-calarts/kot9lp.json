            "comment": "Hi! I\u2019m a former student in the acting program. I\u2019m a bit out of loop w CalArts, but my application process was just a few years ago so let\u2019s see what I can do here-\n\nThe official CalArts acceptance rate is hovering somewhere around 27%. And though the theatre school won\u2019t give you a number, the acting acceptance rate is a lot lower than that. I\u2019d say about 400-500 folks audition for a slot, and maybe 30-35 get that acceptance letter. Also, the number of auditionees this year may be significantly higher (or lower) due to covid. Could be higher cuz you can do it all online and don\u2019t have to travel, and it could be lower cuz, well, ya\u2019know, theatre is kinda dead at this point. You\u2019ll have to see. \n\nNow let\u2019s talk about the GPA stuff. Though there are \u2018critical studies\u2019 classes, CalArts is an art school first and foremost. So portfolio (or in this case audition) is most important. But! They still take a look at your grades, and there\u2019s this thing called the \u2018Artist\u2019s Statement;\u201d this is basically the \u201cwhy I do what I do and why I wanna go to your school\u201d essay. And believe me, it\u2019s pretty important. For example, my live audition was dogshit. But when they went over my application, they must have noticed that I had great grades, solid test scores, and a killer Artist\u2019s Statement. So I got in.\n\nNow, when I got to CalArts, I\u2019ll be honest here- I was expecting some people in my class to be the stereotypical \u2018dumb pretty\u2019 actor type. Not the case at all. Not only is everyone in this program talented, they\u2019re all smart as a whip. I\u2019ve talked to a lot of them about grades, scores, etc, and a good hunk of them likely could have gotten into high tier universities had they chosen that route instead.\n\nSo what I\u2019m trying to say here is, yes, while talent in acting does come first, continue to immerse yourself in school- ESPECIALLY those humanities classes. Each paper you write makes you a better critical thinker. And that\u2019ll make you a better actor. \n\nPlease PM me if you have any other questions about the school, program, essays, etc. Quarantine leaving me bored as hell so happy to help.",

My actual monologues went very well, but I was so visibly stressed because of being late that I feel like I completely bombed my interview. They were so kind to me, despite my awkward fumbling answers, though, and many of the questions they asked me live resembled the ones that I answered in my actor's statement. Thankfully, I was much more articulate on paper than verbally. XD",

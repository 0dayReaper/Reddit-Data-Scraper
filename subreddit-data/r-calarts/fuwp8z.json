            "comment": "Do still life studies. A great way to learn is to start with a VERY limited palette. Value studies with black and white, add one color for monotone studies, then ditch the black and pick two or three primary colors with or without white.  \n\nIf you don't want to do all that work then just force yourself to use as limited a pallete as possible, slowly adding colors as you begin to understand color relationships and light as it relates to color. It's really important to do lots of studies from real life and as the other person said, check out Color and Light by James Gurney.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/hVjExCsZ8YY",

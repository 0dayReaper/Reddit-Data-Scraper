    "postText": "So I'm an international student from Egypt, and I just got rejected from character animation (Fall of 2020)\n\nOver the course of the past few months (throughout the process of applying and getting rejected ) I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I need to improve my observational drawing skills of figures/models, in order to be even considered for the program..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut that leaves me with one problem, as I live in a country where it\u2019s literally illegal to have life-drawing classes (with nude models), I\u2019m not sure how I can demonstrate my anatomy/figure drawing skills without actual life-drawings from real models?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean I understand that you can include clothed models (which I will try as much as I can to do as well, I\u2019ll make sure to include various urban drawings of people and practice more and more, and demonstrate that in my sketchbook), but they pretty much specify in the portfolio requirements that they need applicants to include nude models as part of the application? and it needs to be drawn from life?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut my questions is, do they take into account that some people just don\u2019t and can never have access to that?\n\nand so will it suffice, if I practice anatomy from photographs/video references from sources such as croquis cafe, and include those practices in my sketchbook/online portfolio??? or will they feel bummed out by it and completely disregard even looking at my portfolio (noting that I\u2019m pretty sure they can tell when something has been drawn from photographs or life)  \n\n\n  \nhere is [my rejected sketchbook](https://youtu.be/zyfrLHiItlw)  \nand [my online portfolio](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hj3DaXNoLRQUC2sowdpJ9Z-qm48zjyjh)",

            "comment": "I think your technique is quite good, actually. You show a wide range of subjects, and it's clear that you have good observational skills. You're not yet comfortable with the human form, but that's to be expected from a new student. You also rely on lines a bit too much, but your paintings show promise and a willingness to learn. Read 'Color and Light' by James Gurney - it will help. Overall you show that you're a serious student, who has a decent grasp of the fundamentals. This is hammered home by your use of color, and your perspective studies: they are excellent.\n\nI would not reject this portfolio based on technique.\n\nBut if I was on the committee, and I had to reject your application... let's say just because places are limited and some candidates were better... it would be because your sketchbook doesn't really show YOU.\n\nWho are you? What kind of stories do you want to tell? Have you learned anything about yourself, recently?\n\nYes, you have some personal/diary drawings. Those are excellent! But there aren't very many. It's enough to be promising, but not enough to be convincing.\n\nYour best page, for me, is at 7:47 in your video. The one with the post-it note about not being able to draw anymore. I love your use of color in it - it that a single blue line? - but more importantly it's very personal. It sparkles with emotion, with a tragic story that the viewer's only allowed to see a little bit of. It's good that you included the note, and it's also good that you didn't explain much: it's okay to leave some things private. But the page definitely sparks curiosity. I also really love the style, it has a 20's vibe to it. If that's how you draw when you are expressing emotion, then you should really explore that, because it's bangin' and there's a lot of interest in 20's style animation today.\n\nThere is nothing like that in your 'creative work' folder. And few pages like that in your sketchbook, overall.\n\nI did like your storyboard that says 'happiness sold in a jar'. That's a nice concept that makes me curious about the story. The rest of the folder is mostly character sketches. Some are good, some not so much, but they come across as impersonal style practice.\n\nIf you're going to apply again, do more personal stuff. Start the same way: diary page, then BAM! PERSPECTIVE SKILLS! Combine personal things with technical things. Maybe you lost your favorite scarf in a cafe? Draw the cafe, draw the scarf, draw your sense of loss. Utilize your sense of color, and grasp on perspective, those are your strongest points. But also, show a process, i.e. make diary pages about any wisdoms/reflections/insights you have. Make a page in the beginning with what you hope to learn, then at the end, do a 'did I learn the thing?' kind of page. Do also keep up with what you've been doing: movement studies, style explorations, plenty of figure studies, etc.\n\nI don't think not having enough nude figure drawing is a problem. If you're unsure, you can email the school. You could also do some diary pages about how impossible it is to do nude life drawing in your country (maybe reminiscing about it while at a beach?), or do a charcoal drawing from a photo and hope nobody asks, or draw yourself if you feel safe doing that, or include some people in swimwear, or do lots of (good) figure drawings of clothed people. I think all of those options would show that you are serious about getting proper figure practice, and since it's clear that you can draw, I really can't imagine it would be a disqualifier. But only the school knows for sure.",

My concern is that I don't know who I would ask for recommendations. So my question is if you already graduated high school, who did you ask for recommendations?",

Doesn\u2019t have to be someone in animation.\nArt teacher or artist oriented people would be better to get a letter from.\n\nBut you sketch book or your portfolios is what matters the most in getting into CalArts. The school only cares about your body of work and doesn\u2019t even really look at academics. The school of animation is the hardest to get into as well so take that with a grain of salt. People usually post the sketchbook they sent CalArts on YouTube(Accepted and rejected)\n\nI never heard of anyone stressing about letters of rec at CalArts.",

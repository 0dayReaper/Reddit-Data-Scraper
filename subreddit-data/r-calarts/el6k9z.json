    "postText": "Hello, sorry if it\u2019s a stupid question, but I was opting to go for community college and forget my dreams about being an animator. I went through many personal troubles throughout high school, so I never did well in certain subjects. I currently have one D in Chemistry,  which my school counselors say is unacceptable if I want to apply to a four year college. Does this mean I cannot be accepted into Calarts if I have a D in a required class? Will I need to fix it before applying?",

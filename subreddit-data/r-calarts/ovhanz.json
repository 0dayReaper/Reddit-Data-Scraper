    "postText": "Hi there, I'm currently a software engineering intern for a start up called MealMe. MealMe is an IOS app that compares food delivery services (DoorDash, Uber Eats, GrubHub, etc.) to get users the fastest and cheapest option. We have year-round internship positions for software engineering, marketing, **UI/UX design**, and operations. Apply at: [https://www.mealme.ai/careers](https://www.mealme.ai/careers). It is in-person in San Francisco, but MealMe also has a remote option.\n\nThanks!\n\n\\-Ben @ MealMe",

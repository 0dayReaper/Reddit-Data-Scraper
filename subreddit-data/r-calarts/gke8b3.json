                    "comment": "I see how another person kinda commented on this, so I'll add: of course you should try and do drawings from life, esp for figure drawing and observational stuff. But landscape painting is different: unless u r skilled at sketching and painting in a very short period of time, its very difficult to to live painting on the spot because the light shifts constantly and you might need to spend several hours doing it. So as I recommended above, go to the actual place u wanna paint, get the general gist of it, do some thumbnails, make a rough sketch, and take some photo as your reference. There is no problem using them for your work, unless your blatantly plagiarizing someone else's work. Ive done several pieces in my portfolio from photo ref and got in just fine. Don't stress too much over it. Good luck!",

Sorry if I sounded too aggressive \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d I just stressed myself out too much when I was putting together my portfolio cuz I thought exactly same.. that you have to draw everything from life, not using any photo ref. So I try to tell anyone who has the same concern to just relax a little bit cuz ultimately it all comes down to your craftsmanship and creativity! Thanks for your comment!!\ud83d\udc97\ud83e\udd17",

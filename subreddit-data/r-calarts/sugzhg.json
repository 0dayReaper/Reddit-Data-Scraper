    "postText": "Everyone who posts videos about getting into CalArts seem to already be amazing illustrators and animators. Their portfolios and sketchbooks look like they already went through art college. I thought I was an okay artist, but these people make my drawings look like a drunk octopus drew them. Can you get into CalArts with mediocre or average level art if you showcase you have a strong understanding of story, or do people with more average talent not get accepted. Would love to know your thoughts!",

            "comment": "Ok, so I don\u2019t go to CalArts, but I do know that CalArts is crazy expensive and if you plan on going there and you are not confident with your art skills yet, I think it would be a smart move to take some time honing those skills at a community college first. think about it, the tuition for CalArts is roughly 25k per semester, which is only a few classes. On the other hand, a cc is only going to run you a few hundred per semester, or it will be completely free, if you\u2019re low income. I have some really great teachers at my CC, two of which graduated from Art Center, and one from CalArts, so I\u2019d advice to not underestimate  your cc art programs before you look into who teaches the classes. If you take some classes at the CC level, really hone your fundamentals, maybe some basic color theory, painting, etc. you\u2019ll buff yourself up a bit more. The plus side to this is two things: that maybe your portfolio will be more likely to be accepted at that point and that you will have improved for little to no money and be at a hugher level by the time you enter CalArts, so that what you learn there is learned more effectively. One of my teachers (who graduated from Art Center) put it this way. At a given lever, there\u2019s only so much you can learn on a subject in a 4 month period. There\u2019s a cap on how much that skill will grow. So if you are a beginner, it you\u2019ll only b able to improve by a certain amount, whether you go to CalArts or a CC. So you may as well spend less money, learn those skills, and then go into CalArts when you\u2019re already primed to really improve those skills. He himself went to a cc for 3 years taking all the art classes he could before going to Art Center. I\u2019m not necessarily saying that\u2019s for everyone, but he recommends at least taking some, especially if you\u2019re a beginner in a sense.",

            "comment": "it sounds like you're interested in the Character Animation program. if so, it is a very competitive program. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbut there are things you can do to improve your chances of being accepted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\npractice observational life drawing every day (or almost every day) in a sketchbook. if you mostly do illustration, that's not your way into the program. if you want to do illustration, i suggest finding a great illustration program. CalArts doesn't have an illustration program. if you want to write and tell stories that you animate with characters you've created, supported by a strong foundation in observational life drawing, then practice all those things. \n\ndraw everyone around you as much as you can. draw places you're in, different kinds of people of different shapes, sizes, aesthetics, and circumstances. develop a lifestyle of drawing your experiences in a sketchbook. the more observational life drawing you do, the easier it will be for you to create interesting, original characters. but you also need to study storytelling. part of understanding storytelling is experiencing lots of different kinds of stories. if you mostly experience stories in the form of animated shows and movies from the last 30-40 years, expand your range of influences. try classic literature, foreign films, mythology, holy books, history, psychology, philosophy; anything different, anything the other applicants aren't looking at.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ncontact the admissions office. they employ people to specifically help you put together a more competitive portfolio, whatever program you're interested in.",

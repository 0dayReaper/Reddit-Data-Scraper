How do i send translated transcipts lol\n\n3-What did you guys said in the artist statement there is only ONE artist statement to calarts in youtube and it is unknown if its accepted or not my pyschologist is telling me to go look for it haha\n\n4-In portfolio can you do life drawings that is not just from real world.For example can't I just look at nude models from internet and draw them.Of course you need life drawings from real world too I know that.\n\n5-Can I still get accepted If I don't have an animation to show in my portfolio\n\n6-I live in Turkey since I was a child  but I am also an British Citizen Do I have to take that English Ability Test\n\n7-Does Calarts need my YKS (Basically Turkish SATS lol) results. For US citizens SATS isn't needed but maybe its different for internationals\n\n8- Oops forgot about the most important one when are the spring 2022 applications since fall 2021 one is closed (not that big of a deal since im not ready that much) \n\nWell that's it hope you guys can understand and answer me\n\n(pls dont laugh at my questions )",

            "comment": "Hi I just got accepted into the character animation program and I\u2019m gonna try my best to answer your questions!\n\n1) Any of your high school teachers or just mentors in general can write your rec letter. Once you start your application you send a request to your chosen rec letter writer through the portal and after that you don\u2019t have to worry about it anymore because CalArts will tell them how to proceed. Just make sure your writers submit the letter on time.\n\n2) Your high school counselor should send them. You can request them to send it on the dates that calarts need you to upload the transcripts.\n\n3) Answer the questions they gave you. Personally I wrote it like telling a story. I made it super personal and tried not to think about what calarts wanted but what I wanted out of calarts. tip: dont kiss a$$ XD\n\n4) you can def put stuff from non 3D. It\u2019s better if you do have life drawings but I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll look for the difference too much. Avoid drawing mainstream pics I guess because they prob would catch that it was drawn from a picture.\n\n5) yes you can definitely. They teach you how to animate there so. If you do have animations then it won\u2019t hurt to add them. The focus lies more on your observational drawing skills because they\u2019re not gonna go in depth with teaching you that when you attend. \n\n6) I would just in case. They\u2019re accepting duolingo eng test now which is much cheaper plus faster than toefl. \n\n7) no I don\u2019t think so you should contact admissions about it because it\u2019s a very specific question\n\n8) I\u2019m not sure but you can probably find it on their website !\n\ninternational student link: https://calarts.edu/admissions/apply/international-applicants",

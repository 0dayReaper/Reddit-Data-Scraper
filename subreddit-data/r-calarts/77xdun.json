I want to apply to CalArts for Fall 2020, in Character Animation, but I'm not sure what kind of art classes I should take to help improve my drawing. Do I just take life drawing classes, or do I start with figure drawing and then take an animation class? ",

You need talent and persistence, plus the right background, but having a goofy idea or medium works there. Experimental Animation is also more open to these ideas. Look at that program.",

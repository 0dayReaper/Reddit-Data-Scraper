    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI\u2019m planning on applying to the class of 2027 for Calarts and I wanted to know when the application process would open. I\u2019ve accidentally started two applications (due to some confusion) for admissions into the 2022 semesters and contacted the admissions office to see if I could remove those applications but haven\u2019t received an answer back yet (which I hope was the correct move). \n\nI\u2019ve tried looking for threads, links, websites that could give some more information but for my efforts, I haven\u2019t found anything. \n\nSo I guess I wanted to ask if I have to wait for admissions (for Fall of 2033) to open? If they are open, is it possible that I overlooked something? Was it the right call emailing the admissions office for starting two (accidental) applications to see if I could remove them?",

Calarts is going into a campus wide power outage until the 25th of August so the response would be on a slower side, but ya def contact the admissions office about it!",

CalArts has an assistant director for each school and it\u2019s part of their job to guide you in the application process.",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm a student who will be applying next year, and I heard that there are people who got rejected just because they were drawing in the japanese anime style, and it would be a disadvantage if they use that style in their portfolios.\n\nAnd while I like to try many different styles of arts, I have 10 episodes of cartoon that I have made last year (like 50\\~70drawings for one episode) that is drawn in the typical japanese anime style, and I really think that shows my storytelling skills and lots of other skills related to animation, and  I also really think that's one of my strong pieces.\n\nBut I heard that Calarts dislikes the japanese anime style and some people even said they wouldn't accept people who use that style.\n\nSo I'm really wondering if I should put that piece in my portfolio or not.",

I think it\u2019ll be fine to put in the port as long as you add variety (ex: my character designs were anime style but my environment designs weren\u2019t really) just don\u2019t put fanart.",

(I want to work in major studios or indie)\n \u2022How long does it take for a Animation student based in Los Angeles to pay off debts.\n \u2022Is there anything else a international student should know.*",

One piece of counter intuitive advice I heard: those that get recruited out of animation before finishing are the \u201cbest\u201d meaning most marketable talents. People who finish their degrees are not as sought after. So it\u2019s really a quick funnel into a job, if that\u2019s what you want.",

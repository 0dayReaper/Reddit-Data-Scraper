    "postText": "I notice that many life drawings from Calarts have this sort of look to them. They tend to be quite wonky and disproportionate while still catching the overall feel of the subject. Is that intentional, is it some sort of exaggeration. Do I need to pay attention to proportion and precision/accuracy so much when working on my submissions? What do I need to pay attention to and leave out?",

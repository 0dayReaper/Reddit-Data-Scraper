    "postText": "Can I visit campus right now?  Just park and walk around, not even go into the building?  (vaxed &amp; masked!).  Daughter is very interested in CalArts fall 2022, school of film/video but hasn't been able to do a single tour of any school and its just so hard to get a sense of the vibe. We are driving down from SF tomorrow and just want to walk around campus for even 10 min, do you think that's ok?  thank you for your input",

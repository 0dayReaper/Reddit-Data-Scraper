Just so I can keep them in mind as I work on my application.",

I'm pretty sure they see it first in the order of things, but don't take my word on that. Make sure your figure drawing is solid, of course. Really solid \u2013\u00a0don't try to stylize and exaggerate forms if it doesn't come naturally to you yet. Just keep drawing and you'll naturally develop a shorthand of your own. Try out loads of different mediums. When I was applying, I went through phases of really liking colored pencils, but later struggling with them. Switched to pen and loved pen for a while, then went back to colored pencil. Wouldn't really recommend marker though, never really worked for me. Too thick for details. \n\n\\- Go big on your gestures, your 30 seconds and 1-2 minutes. If you're drawing in your sketchbook, do one figure per page. If you're doing charcoal, fill the whole sheet of paper. It might feel like a waste because you do so many, but when you get that \\*one gesture\\* that has *perfect* flow, amazing line work, your best drawing ever? You're going to be glad you drew it big instead of tiny. And always, *always* draw hands and feet. The whole figure. \n\n\\- For your sketchbook? Just draw stuff you see around you. Fill the pages. Don't just draw one thing and move on, go back and see if you can add something else to the page even if you draw over your first drawing. Did a portrait of a person in colored pencil? Try drawing an environment in pen behind them. Find ways to fill the composition in interesting ways and it will be more fun than trying to keep every page \"clean.\" It'll help you be less precious about your sketches and you might stumble across something cool along the way.\n\n\\- GOUACHE IS THE BEST THING EVER. It's the best of both worlds between watercolor and acrylic for a sketchbook\n\n\\- Make a film! No, you don't have to finish a whole film, but start a project! Tell a story. Do the concept art for it, design the characters, the environments, storyboard it, even animate a little if you're up for it. My mentor, when I would meet with them my first year, always mentioned to me the film I submitted in my portfolio, it seemed to have really made an impression on them. \n\n\\- And last but not least, don't get too bogged down looking at videos of \"accepted calarts sketchbooks.\" There is no \"this is what an accepted calarts sketchbook looks like.\" Worry more about the portfolio lol, that's where you have to be a little more technical. \n\nAnyway, hope that ramble helped a bit. I remember when I was in your position and while I rarely comment on things, I came across your post and it reminded me of that time when I too was urgently scouring the internet for hints lol. So yeah, good luck!",

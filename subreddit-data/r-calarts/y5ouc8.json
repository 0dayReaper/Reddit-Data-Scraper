    "postText": "I'm currently living on Latin America and my dream has always been to be part of the Animation industry in California. I already have a bachelor in design and illustration and now I have the resources to attend an art college on the USA for a major. My first option is Calarts mostly for the networking and I wanted to know if you have any comments or thoughts about this MFA, if it's harder to get in than a bachelor or easier, if it's highly demanding or I could have a part time job at the same time... Just wanted to know more of it since it's a big investment.. thanks!!!!",

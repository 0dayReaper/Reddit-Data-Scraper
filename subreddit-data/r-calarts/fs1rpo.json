But they do send it couple days before the decision is released, so keep an eye out for it!\n\nAlso the decisions CAN come out in early to mid April. I know it sucks but that's just how they handle this process. Good luck!!",

Most of them have them still pending, just like yours. And Calarts sent out emails to admitted students saying that there has been some delays in fin aid department due to COVID19, so don't worry about it still saying under review. Hopefully your decision comes out soon!!!",

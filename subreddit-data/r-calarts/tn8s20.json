Are you there acting applicants? plzzzz contact me i know there must be someone as confused as i am. the only decisions i have seen from theater department were xdp ones",

I guess I will just wait until next week... Many ppl from many programs are emailing the admissions office and they must be busy and tired. They say it is possible for you to get your decision until early april. I guess I will try to relax and wait until the end of this timeline. I just want to know if ppl are getting their updates so I can have an idea of the place where I am standing for the moment.",

But I really want to get into 2d animation and Story boarding, something that calarts does best. Is calarts only for people already pro in the 2d field, or will they accept someone willing to learn and switch over from 3d to 2d?",

            "comment": "I'm an older Character Animation student (on leave). They accept you based on your drawing skills and storytelling potential. They want to see you experimenting, and they want to see that you have an artistic voice: something you want to say, and a way you tend to say, expressed by the artistic and stylistic choices you make, maybe for all of your work, maybe on a drawing-by-drawing basis. \n\nI had just enough drawing skills and cheats to get in, and I had a very strong voice in the specific ways I used color, line and exaggeration. I'm not that great at drawing (certainly not as good as some of my 18 year old classmates were). But trust me, most students at CalArts are definitely NOT 2D pros, and only a fraction have ever worked in the industry (or like, worked a day in their lives ever). I'm one of the few students who actually wants to animate for a living (3D or 2D). But if you're already in the industry, you may not need CalArts. You could self-teach and save yourself $100K. The teaching is pretty good, but it's erratic sometimes. Even their story classes lack focus at times. If you are in the wrong year, you might not get the education you paid for. Most people come for the connections, but the drama in the program can get so intense that, again, you might not get the connections you were hoping for. I have formed stronger professional connections outside of CalArts than within. \n\nFor 2D, just get yourself a light table and force yourself to learn timing by hand drawing. You don't even need animation paper. \n\nBut if you really want in, beef up your drawing skills by studying figure drawing and drawing from life, and drawing stories or snippets of stories, with drawings that tell a story. You want drawings that have weight, and movement and story. (Just make up a story for your observational drawings and work it into the image.) Some technical drawing skills are important (in terms of perspective), but they want to see your potential for expression and exaggeration. It's really your choice how you want to express something, wherever you see the potential for exaggeration. Study composition from films, TV, etc. You could showcase some of your 3D work in your portfolio. In fact, if the only 2d work in your portfolio is your figure drawings and your sketchbook, that could work out just fine. They need more people who are interested in 3D, and they don't need to know that you want to go there to pursue 2D and story.\n\nBut they won't accept you if they don't think your drawing skills aren't up to scratch. And trust me, you wouldn't want to be there if you didn't have the drawing skills to keep up with the intense 1st and 2nd year schedule and workload. It would be a waste of money. And I mean it when I say it's intense. It's like taking 20 units but you're only taking 12! They don't teach you to draw at CalArts. They teach you what to draw and why to draw things in a certain way, to inform the artistic choices you make. It's like the difference between learning to read, and reading to learn. \n\nIt's not that hard, once you figure out what they want and once you have a good grasp on expressive drawing. Drawing is very much a learnable thing. You're already helping making films, so I'm thinking you have an eye for imagery. Get yourself some books on animation, and figure drawing and start reading them and start taking some classes at SMC or something. \n\nBut since you are already in the industry, I'd still really recommend looking at some other options to get into 2D animation and storyboarding. CalArts is not the only way to learn this stuff. ",

I feel like calarts don't really do much 3D, most of the students who graduated are doing visual development and story in the industry.",

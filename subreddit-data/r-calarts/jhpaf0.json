            "comment": "It\u2019s excellent and hard fucking work. Lots of all nighters. CalArts is one of the best graphic design programs period. It\u2019s interesting too, it\u2019s heavily geared towards classic graphic design, experimentation, and analog printing/processes, more about the critical thought and concepts behind graphic design rather than classes that teach you how to use programs-that part is (for the most part) up to you. They don\u2019t accept many per year but you do need a somewhat sizable portfolio, at least I did. Needed at least 15 pieces I think as well as some basic drawing. I will say, that a HUGE draw of the program is getting your own 24/7 dedicated studio space in a room with your whole class where you will collaborate a lot. You\u2019ll be with the same ~15 people for 4 years. So with that in mind I would probably guess that online classes would be more difficult.",

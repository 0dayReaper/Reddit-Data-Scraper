    "postText": "Hello! I was recently accepted for the MFA program in Music Composition &amp; Experimental Sound Practices. Wondering if anyone here has experience with that program, and if there's any possibility of a tour of the grounds sometime soon. I live in LA and drove up the other day to check it out, and it's basically a ghost town. I'm apprehensive about starting next semester without fully knowing when I'll be able to attend in person.",

I can't find any pictures of a room from the Ahmanson which is sus lmfaooooo \n\nDoes anyone have any insight? Is the Chouinard or Ahmanson is better for someone who is looking for a single room?

Shit sucks so it\u2019s best find a room to rent with fellow CalArts people.\nOnly perk is your studios are a short walk instead of a short drive. \nPretty much 4 people per apartment and 4 single bed dorms  kitchen area and bathroom",

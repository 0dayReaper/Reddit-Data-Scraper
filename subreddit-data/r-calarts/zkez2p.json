    "postText": "Hello! I am applying to the character animation program for next fall, and I was wondering what I should do for the sketchbook portion of the application. In the QnA for Film/Video, they said that you should just use the sketchbook as a normal sketchbook, and draw whatever you want it in, making sure to include a lot of figure studies along the way. The purpose is, from what I heard, is to showcase your growth, as well as your personality. My issue is that my current sketchbook was used to study figure drawing mostly, so while it does show immense growth from the beginning to the end, it's a bit rough around the edges and doesn't show much of my personality. If I'm confident in my ability to fill one in by the application due date, should I start a new one? Thanks so much",

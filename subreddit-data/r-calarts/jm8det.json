            "comment": "So I\u2019m a sophomore (2nd year) and I attended CalArts physically my freshman year so I can put it like this. \n\nI am a art major so I\u2019ll put it like this\n\nI\u2019d need to get to school normally around 8-9 to get to school around 9-10 A.M. for breakfast. I drove my first semester so I\u2019d get up early but when I started dorming I\u2019d sleep in and walk to the main building. \n\nDepending on what major you\u2019re in and your year level depended upon the number of classes you had and how many you took a day.\n\nI had one class in the morning for 9 to 12 and then at noon I\u2019d have lunch. \n\nCalArts had a cafeteria that served different meals to choose from 3 times a day, a pizza bar, Sandwhich bar, Cereal bar, snack bar, burger bar, vegan option and a traditional lunch menu. We also had a cafe that served coffee and pastries. \n\nAfter lunch I\u2019d go on to my next class that could go on til the afternoon to evening. \nInbetween classes I\u2019d go to my studio to work or I\u2019d go to the library or the cafeteria to do homework. If I had nothing else to do I would go back to my dorm to relax or hang out with others around campus.\nIf I had a evening class I\u2019d grab dinner and then go to my dorm to relax. \nWhen choosing classes you have to have a minimum of 15 units and a max of 20 to satisfy your degree requirements. Last year I had around 18 credits which was like 6 ish classes throughout the week. At most I had about 3 classes a day. \n\nSome folks have class all day some have only one a day. On days where I didn\u2019t have class I\u2019d go to the studio and work,  just stay in my dorm or leave campus to see my family or shop for supplies. Santa Clarita has a couple shopping areas surrounding CalArts most in walking distance If you don\u2019t have a car (which I did) and a bus system. \n\nDepending upon how many classs you take on and what your school demands of you, you may or may not be able to do off campus activities. I was able to do my work (and pass) and hang out with family, and go out of town. I had class usually 3-4 days out the week not including the weekend. \n\nI had a job on campus at a computer lab, there are different jobs posted around campus If you have federal work study or if you just want a job. Some worked off campus too.",

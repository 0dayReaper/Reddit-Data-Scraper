Ive been keeping a sketchbook of observational drawings of people, animals, locations, etc. but I have also been keeping an observational watercolor sketchbook for fun. Am I allowed to submit two sketchbooks or should I pick out a couple of the watercolor sketches and add them to my portfolio? Thanks!",

So if you feel really comfortable in watercolor\u2014comfortable enough to experiment and play and tell a story\u2014do it, but if not, spend more time making a multimedia one. They love gouache. They love being open to new mediums and ideas. But most of all they want you to tell a story! They\u2019re not only looking at if you\u2019re just trying to do \u201cthe best art.\u201d",

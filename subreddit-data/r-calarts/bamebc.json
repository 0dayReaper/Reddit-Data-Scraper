I am looking at the portfolio requirements and they specify how many observational pieces they want but do not state how many creative pieces they want. Should I just give them what Ill have by then or should there be a certain number I should be aiming for? Thanks!",

A bout half were life drawings, a handful of landscape and animal studies, two storyboards then the rest character designs, illustrations and other creative works. I got accepted :)\n\nBtw 37 is considerably more than other applicants had but as long as each piece is good enough and perhaps demonstrates something the other pieces don\u2019t then you\u2019re all good! 25-40 is a good number imo",

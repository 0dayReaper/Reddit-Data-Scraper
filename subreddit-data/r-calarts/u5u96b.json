    "postText": "Recently admitted student looking to tour campus during my spring break!  I\u2019m a high school senior from the Bay Area, California and I was recently admitted for Design and Production with a focus on costume design for CalArts XDP program and was looking to visit on April 18(tmrw!) If there are any current Theater or XDP students who will be free on this day, at any time, and are willing to meet up with me for maybe an hour or however long you have, to give me maybe a mini tour or just talk about the program and your experience and thoughts over coffee (on me!), please comment or PM me!   I\u2019m just interested in learning more about the program and what students think of it. Thank you all so much! \n\nUnfortunately I wasn\u2019t able to sign up for a tour in time but does anyone know if I can just show up and tag along with a tour on the day of, even if i\u2019m not registered to be on the tour?",

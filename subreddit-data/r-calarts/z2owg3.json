    "postText": "Hi! I'm looking for a career change from Comp Sci to animation, and so I'm thinking about trying for grad school. Would the MFA in Experimental Animation at CalArts be useful in getting a job in the industry? (It seems kind of on the artsier side as compared to Character Animation, but if experimental implies freedom to explore our own artistic voice, can we gear our work towards traditional 2D etc?)",

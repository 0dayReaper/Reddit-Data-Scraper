    "postText": "I want to get a feel of my odds. I'm 20 and previously I was completely put off by school because I was bullied in high school by students and teachers. I had one bully who even tried to break my arm and a teacher who ruined my social life and if you're in a school with a total of 60 kids in the middle of nowhere that's a massive deal. \n\nSchool was bad and my grades were mostly Ds and Cs until I was finally able to get into an independent study program at another school my senior year. I graduated with As and Bs. \n\nAfter school I immediately started a tattoo apprenticeship and finnished. Work hasn't been good for me due to my location and how mean tattoo artists are around here. \n\nNow I work part time, just broke up with my bf of 4 years, and I live with my mom and my sister, her husband, and baby and I am so done with everything here in this shitty, small town. I want to do the character animation program and start a career in it when I'm done. CalArts is the closest to me and the hardest to get into and I am determined to do it. I know what I need to put in my sketch book but I'm kind of confused how to do it. I need to show my skills and I want to put lots of dynamic poses and backgrounds. I also need to put origin characters and people in motion. Now with showing people in motion, I live in a rual town and my car has been broken for a while so I can't drive to the next big town, would looking at youtube videos of people playing tennis or something for the motion drawings be good or would they be able to tell?  Also I will be attending my local community college to get a head start and take an art class and ask for a teacher to help with my portfolio and sketch book. \n\nAlso my style is more like American mixed with manga comics and it's still being developed. My coloring skills aren't awesome but I also feel that's the point of a sketch book is to improve but I don't know if that's what they're looking for. I was looking at accepted sketch books on YouTube and I don't see many sketch lines at all and some rejected ones I can see why they were (sloppy, not sketches but look more like an art book,  not showing what they asked for, etc.) Does anyone have any tips? Can anyone give me an idea how hard it is to get in and how many times you've tried? How hard the courses are and how general ed is here is? Also campus life and the like :)",

            "comment": "It's extremely hard to get into. Basically a crapshoot, even if you're already one of the \"best\" figure life drawers in the class. People who I knew who got in showed me their portfolio and frankly a lot of it was just the best figure drawing I've ever seen. Expressive, dynamic, accurate, stylized but never cartoonish. It was just extremely beautiful renderings of the world around them. According to them the professors want people who can fucking draw ANYTHING from any angle. Then on top of that they want you to have a personal flare that they can work with. They don't want someone to come in and draw anime or to draw Disney...they just want to see beautiful imagery that shows you're ability to be expressive, tell stories and overall bring dynamism to what you draw.\n\nHere's what my animator friends told me:\n\n1. Stop having \"your own style\" now. Just skip the bad habits that will give you.. All you should do is life drawing for the next year. Until you can draw anyone, anywhere, in any pose then stop worrying about developing your \"personal style\" except on the side for fun. Once you can draw anything anywhere, have some fun with characters/cartooning...but don't start down a bad path of copying anime/cartoons you've already seen.\n\n2. Take gen-eds that interest you becuase Calarts will not accept any of your credits and couldn't care less about how \"balanced\" your education is.\n\n3. Take an animation class somewhere and make sure you actually like it. This won't be worth it for you if you end up not actually liking animation and drop out (a lot do even after they made it at calarts)\n\n4: Get familiar with some 3d animation suites. Don't have to get good yet, but being familiar puts you ahead.\n\n5. You will go into serious debt doing this. Are you okay with that? If you don't make it in the business, you will have hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt before you even get your first job. Why anyone would be okay doing that I do not know. Even if you make a good salary, that's hard to pay off.\n\nCampus Life: For animators? You will live, eat, sleep drawing and animating. You will meet your class and probably the spend the next 35 years of your life around the ones who \"make it\" in the business. I barely saw animators. A few were my friends, but they were all pretty anti-social compared to the rest. The ones who smoked pot were typically a little more approachable, but some of them were borderline autistic and only spoke to other animators.\n\nGeneral Ed: Basically non-existant. This is an art conservatory, don't think of it like a regular college.\n\n",

I applied for FAFSA and we are pretty poor in my house and I'm pretty sure it will cover most of it, it covered my sisters community college. It also isn't like I won't apply for scholarships or grants. \n\nI don't live in an area where animation programs are a thing. I have downloaded some free trials and used free software but the more advanced ones are tricky to do by yourself. I have always wanted to work in the film industry but I don't think I can make it directing and we don't have classes for that anymore either... my community college sucks, it almost gets shut down every year.",

                            "comment": "calarts is a fantastic school, but I'm telling you what so many people don't hear before they go to Calarts: it's expensive, they offer very little aid, and FAFSA is most likely going to simply award you low interest rate loans. The likelihood of you getting Calarts \"paid for\" is pretty slim. I encourage you to work with someone at your community college who understands your goals and can give you some good guidance regarding FAFSA. I'm no expert, but I doubt you're going to have any signifigant portion of the tuition there covered by the school or anyone else unless you win some grants/scholarships (hard to do, but you should obviously try to get whatever you can)\n\nIf you don't live in an area where animation programs are a \"thing\" then I would encourage you to a summer course in a place where they are. Art institute of chicago has one, and others. Again - jumping into a program that costs 60k a year is simply not a smart idea unless you love it. Spend this year doing life drawing and filling sketchbooks, do a summer program for 10-15k. Apply to calarts for September. If the summer program goes well, great - go right into it. If it doesn't, then politely inform calarts that you are no longer interested. I saw tons of kids spend two years at calarts before they saw the light, and were down 80K+ for their trouble.\n\nNo one wants to hear that their dream is hard to achieve, and believe me when I say anyone with the motivation can achieve amazing things - but I'm warning you not to take it lightly. It is expensive, and you should be SOLD on animation before you spend hundreds of thousands on it that you'll someday need to pay off.",

The vast majority has to be paid for some how or I can't do it. \n\nI will definitely do lots of life drawing now and I plan on taking sketch books everywhere I go. Painting more realistic. I'll look into what else my area has to offer but I'm not hopeful. ",

Way easier to get a 5k scholarship off a summer program than to go into major debt for college.\n\nFor now, just focus on your art. Look at great sketchbooks online and on youtube and see what makes them great. Life drawing like crazy: people, places, animals, things...do all of that. Take a human figure class...the are usually cheap. If you dont see one in your area, START ONE and charge people to come. Models are usually 100 dollars, advertise in your paper or on CL.\n\nGood luck to you. Sorry if I sound negative, just trying to offer you good advice rather than the same old overly positive shit that could lead to a bad decision. Know what you're getting into, and if you have doubts then either resolve the doubts or reevaluate what you want.",

You can get some of your critical studies taken care of (some CalArts grads teach there) and see if you want animation or film or art. The best part about CalArts is the whole community of visual/performing artists under one roof. \n\nAnimation is such a concentrated profession, they are looking for people who will slot into it. Some of the animators I knew there (theatre grad) applied several years before they got in.\n\nGood luck.",

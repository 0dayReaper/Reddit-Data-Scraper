I know all of those things are optional, but does CalArts want to see that kind of stuff or do they only focus on your portfolio &amp; transcripts? \n\nThanks!",

You will most likely still need to attend CalArts for four years.",

You take art and animation classes, as well as produce films, from year one.  And each year builds on your knowledge from the previous year.  That means most everyone starts off as a BFA1 no matter how much previous college experience they have.  Although sometimes you can come in as a BFA2.",

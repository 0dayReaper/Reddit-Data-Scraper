    "postText": "I'm from Spain, and I was very seriously thinking on applying to Calarts this year for their Character Animation program. I was already preparing my portfolio and sketchbook and just realised that the prices are too high. How do people afford 50.000$ per year (not counting living expenses)? Are student loans a safe way to go? Can foreign students easily count on scholarships?\n\nThanks for your time!\n",

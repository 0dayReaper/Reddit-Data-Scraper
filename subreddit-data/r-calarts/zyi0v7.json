    "postText": "i haven\u2019t seen much about calarts scholarships anywhere, does anyone know how much they offer, specifically for film/video students? do they offer full rides at all? (from what i\u2019ve heard the answer is probably no, but i\u2019d rather make sure) for any current character animation students; do you find the hefty tuition worth it?",

            "comment": "If you\u2019re specifically wondering about character animation, it seems like we are actually on the lower spectrum when it comes down to scholarship amount. I\u2019ve talked to ppl from other departments and on average they seemed to get quite a lot more than we do. Maybe it\u2019s because char anim is the biggest in terms of population at calarts and the money has to be divided among more ppl. Idk. It is insanely pricey and the fact that they keep raising the tuition but rarely give you more scholarship is not helping at all, but if you can somehow deal with it with a lot of outside scholarships and family money, then i do think the connections and opportunities offered here are somewhat worth it. But if you need to take a huge loan out to go here, don\u2019t. Especially if you\u2019re a domestic student. I mean someone told me the same thing before I applied, but I still did cuz it\u2019s calarts and it\u2019s been my dream school for a long time, and it took me actually coming here and seeing everything with my own eyes to understand what they meant. So I\u2019d say you\u2019re gonna make your own decision no matter what u hear from other ppl anyway, so just assess ur financial situation first and really think about if you\u2019re gonna be able to afford this school. Again, I personally think the community and connections u make here are truly wonderful, but if you\u2019re the type of person who can network wherever u go, then you might not need this school at all. U can pm me if you have more questions!",

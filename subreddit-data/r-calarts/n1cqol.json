    "postText": "\nI am asking about getting into CalArts and its exorbitant price and its difficult admission, since I have thought about wanting to get in but the prices are simply too high, and I think I would be in debt for several years.  I have been thinking about studying animation at a university in my country, but the only thing that makes me more interested in CalArts is that supposedly you will generate more connections and will be more likely to be hired in large animation industries, connections that I don't think a school in my third world country can offer, so, is it worth all the cost of CalArts?",

I feel like art schools are absolutely worth it. My experience has been amazing, I wouldn\u2019t change a thing... but I was a transfer student. 4 yrs at any art school is insane. I received scholarships from both institutions which made the price less crazy. Definitely don\u2019t accept unless you have a nice scholarship and get your GE\u2019s done at a CC. You\u2019ll save so much in the long run. I\u2019m glad I did.",

    "postText": "hello! Im working on a school project to produce some sort of work. I planned to mix peoples music! I have little experience in pro tools and with mixing in general. So please send me stems if you\u2019re interested so I can gain experience and I will be eternally grateful. I\u2019m in my third year and really want to create a portfolio mixing with all different types of styles and genres. Also it doesn\u2019t have to be new work and if you have stuff that\u2019s already mixed I can just work with the raw stems, anything helps!",

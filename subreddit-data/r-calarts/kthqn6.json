    "postText": "Hi all!  I'm graduating from college this year, and I'm interested in going back to school for animation after a few years in the workforce.  I'm interested in working on the 11-minute cartoon format, but I noticed that CalArts doesn't offer an MFA in Character Animation.  Does anyone know if I would be able to acquire the appropriate skill set for network cartoons if I did the MFA in Experimental Animation and took some Character Animation classes as electives (if that's possible?)  Please help me figure out what to go for \ud83d\ude2c",

            "comment": "I'm one of the zany people that graduated with my second bachelors from Character. Experimental focuses on independent animation, stop-motion, and    motion graphics. I think the only regret I had for not getting a masters is the ability to apply to teaching jobs. You can take Character classes but it is extremely limited and Character students get priority. I think when I was there I tried to get into some stop motion classes as a character student. They usually have only 1 or 2 spots. It can be done though. If you are leaning towards more mainstream animation, I would do Character.",

MFA in fiction, poetry, or digital language something. Tuition paid for, monthly stipend, and free health insurance. I got a minor in creative writing at CalArts and as much as I love some of the faculty (Tisa mostly) it's just way too expensive to go to CalArts, they don't offer much financial aid. The writing program at CalArts definitely attracts all sorts of interesting people and you're closer to LA, but I'd recommend applying to a school that pays *you* to go there.",

I don't know how much it is, but it's better than nothing and I sure wish I had it when I moved. CalArts connections are different within the writing world, I can only speak from the art world perspective. I think if you want connections you might want to look elsewhere, the general idea at calarts is more for creating than for producing (capitalism). Calarts is still in a financial crisis thanks to the old dumbass president and many other factors. I've received 2 grants since being at brown but calarts they can't offer the same because of their finances. If the school wants your brain, they should support you to be able to attend! Calarts has a soft spot in my heart but still a nasty blackhole in my pocket.",

I have multiple friends from the experimental animation department that work at cartoon network/adult swim. The animation students seem to have great college to career tracks. Creating vs producing: most art students are not interested in selling their work, they're interested in what the work is/does. Production as in the end product, not the process or connect. I read that the new president is setting up some good changes at calarts especially with financial aid that you could look into!",

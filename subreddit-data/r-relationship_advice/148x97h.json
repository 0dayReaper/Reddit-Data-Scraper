    "postText": "My partner and I have been together for nearly 2 years. He is a very caring, sweet guy who treats me well. He is a gamer, and has a busy social life, which I\u2019m rather opposite and stick more to myself. \nI don\u2019t have a problem with him playing games at all, but there\u2019s one person he talks to that I just can\u2019t get over being uncomfortable about. He talks and plays with his female friend, who he has known for many years before we got together, and there was a point where there was romantic feelings between them. He pursued her, and her him, but never told him that she had a partner. \nAt the start of our relationship they were very close, they talked almost all the time, which I wasn\u2019t very comfortable with but left it alone. I found out later that they would talk about me and our relationship, which really threw me. Now they don\u2019t talk anywhere near as much as they did, however i can\u2019t stop thinking that he still has something there for her, or that she could ask him to do anything and he would. I don\u2019t think she ever wanted to date him, but she always wanted to keep him under her belt, have his attention and what not. I think she liked having that power. \nI found out that she would say only bad things about me, and he would never stand up for me or stop her if she crossed boundaries. That was a year ago, I don\u2019t know how he would react now, but I have it in my head that he would still not stand up for me, and he would do whatever she wanted him to do. They used to talk about us whenever we had problems, but my partner seems to never bring me up now, and if he does, she is quick to dismiss it. \nI can\u2019t stop thinking that he never got over her, and she still means a lot to him. It\u2019s really messing with my head, but I love him to much, it feels like my heart is broken, or like I truly don\u2019t know how he would react if she were to make any advances. \nShe told him that she was engaged and that he was invited, but he didn\u2019t even know that she was engaged, like she hid her relationship from him but wanted to know everything about our relationship. \nI really don\u2019t trust her at all, and I honestly don\u2019t know if I trust he would tell me everything. \nThis is mostly a rant, but I also feel very lost and like I don\u2019t want to ruin this relationship because of my insecurities. He tells me there\u2019s nothing there, but he said that back then too, when I found out she was saying things about me and he was confiding in her.\n\nTLDR - how do I trust my boyfriend talking/ playing with his ex?",

He did with his terrible boundaries and lack of respect for you and your relationship. Now you don't trust him to be forthcoming about her and what she says about you because she means a lot to him. \n\nSo you have a partner with poor boundaries who doesn't respect you and whom you don't trust.  \n\nI'm curious what your standards for \"treats me well\" is? I think you need to spend time thinking about why your current standards are so low. I don't say any of this to be mean. I say it to get the blinders off so you can think about why you accepted that you might be a placeholder for this girl that doesn't want a relationship with him. \n\nYou just need to love yourself more in this situation.",

It sounds like the 2 of them weren't over each other for a while and you never got treated with much respect. These aren't insecurities talking, these are red flags that you are ignoring. Trust your gut instincts.",

If he doesn\u2019t stand up for you and lets her talk badly about you. Dump and move on? Or confront and demand a change and explanations.",

    "postText": "My fianc\u00e9 (25m) and I (25f) got engaged in March of this year. I am so excited and over the moon. I'm excited to be with the love of my life for the rest of my life. With that said I've been having a lot of thoughts in my head about being so disappointed over our engagement. When I mentioned it to a friend that thought I was being over dramatic and that my feelings didn't really matter because either done and over with now. \n\nSo here's the story because I don't know how to not be upset about this and look past it right now because I am so disappointed. \n\nBack when we first started dating, we knew that we were going to get married as we had been through the cesspool that was dating others and knew that we wanted to be with each other forever. We even went as far as basically immediately moving in with each other and joking around about getting married on May 4th, 2024 (we actually are now). In december i asked him if he wanted our wedding date to still be May 4th and he said absolutely, but I need to propose soon. At this point my best friend and I had been hinting to him for weeks about things I would want in a proposal and potential styles of rings. We ended up having an actual conversation about it around late January.  I wasn't asking for anything crazy. The only thing I mentioned was I wanted to look nice, I wanted to have a photographer, and I wanted my best friend and my family to know/help him give ring ideas, and I wanted him to pick out the ring. These all seemed like basic requests for an engagement to me. He said he agreed and that was that. No further conversations for a month or so. Late February he started asking me about what type of ring I would want and made me pick out my own ring. That was one thing that upset me was I just didn't want to know what I was getting. I wanted it to be a surprise and something he picked out with me on his heart and mind. At that point I pretty much knew he ordered the ring and there was an engagement coming soon. \n\nWe were going to disney in early in may and the way him and his mom were talking, it sounded like we were going to get engaged there, which wouldve been my absolute dream, and I did tell him that during our conversation in January.\n\nWe got engaged on our second year anniversary in March and it was definitely not what I expected. That night we weren't going to celebrate our anniversary. We both agreed to that because he had a work thing that he had to work late on and I had a concert band performance and meetings to go to that night. Apparently he changed his mind. I went to my meetings that night dressed in sweats and a tshirt not showering in 2 days and I looked like a hot mess (it was a fraternity meeting so it was super casual dress in whatever I wanted). When he picked me up after the meeting to go home, he turned a different way and took us to the other side of campus by our student center. At this point it was like 11 pm and we both were super tired. He had me get out of the car and go on a walk with him. I had already had a horrible day (sobbing in the car to him about some really really really bad stuff that I don't wanna really talk about that happened that day). Then we walked to a bridge and he kept saying we can't do this anymore, we can't be boyfriend and girlfriend anymore. And I was literally heaving crying because I thought he was breaking up with me. Then he got down and proposed to me. I did say yes because I wanted to marry him and be with him for the rest of my life.  \n\nI immediately called my family and told them, they thankfully knew and were so happy, I was a bit disappointed that they weren't there. I also found out that I had nothing to remember the moment as there was no photographer (of course I have the memory and the ring and the man that's obvious) but I'm a photo person because I have severe memory problems due to a TBI to the point that I can't remember large events or moments for weeks at a time. The only reason I feel like I remember it was because that whole day was SUPER traumatic for me with the incidents of the day before that. \n\nI then called my best friend and told her. I found out that she knew absolutely nothing. That really upset me because she is one of the most important people in my life and she knew everything and anything about what I would want. I know that he might not want her involved but he knew how important that was to me. She kinda shaded him that she was sad she didn't know (I did tell her to apologize and then hung up with her). I was upset with her for that. \n\nI also looked like absolute trash that day so that kinda upset me but I'm over that.\n\nNow it's a few months later, we're in the wedding planning process right now and we have had 3 friends get engaged since then. I keep getting sad every time I see engagement pictures from friends or videos of their engagements or other people's ones.\n\nMaybe I'm being super over dramatic, but I'm just disappointed that it felt like he doesn't listen and doesn't care and put in the minimal amount possible for us. \n\n\nSo that friend called me an asshole and overdramatic and said that I should just be happy to be engaged, but Idk. I am happy and overjoyed. And so in love, but I'm also upset that one thing I've dreamed about for years just has all this animosity and trauma behind it now. \n\nIdk how to bring this up to my SO or if I even should but I'm not sure if I can get my disappointment and animosity out of my head for him right now. So should I talk him about this and express my frustrations or just drop it? Is it something that really doesn't matter? \n\nTLDR: I'm upset over how our engagement happened and I'm not sure if I should talk to him about it.",

You gave him a real simple and short checklist - and he didn\u2019t do any of that lmao. \n\nMy cynical take is maybe this is a glimpse into your future marriage. \n\nDoes he lack listening skills in other areas too?",

    "postText": "So basically I already had romantic history with my friends ex prior to them meeting. They met and got into a relationship and I didn\u2019t talk to her for like a year out of respect. Recently they broke up and I met up with her and just talked about everything thats happened because we didn\u2019t talk for like 2 years. Feelings resurfaced and in the moment I kissed her which ik probably wasn\u2019t the best decision. I\u2019m moving to college in a few months so my current friend group probably won\u2019t even be my friends in the future but I just need advice moving foward? should i just completely cut things with the girl or should I keep it a secret from my group.",

            "comment": "Sounds like you're in a tough position. You should probs take responsibility for your actions and understand that what you did may have hurt your friend. It's important to communicate with your friend about what happened and apologize for any pain you may have caused. You may also want to consider giving your friend some space for a while to process their emotions. This is hard but the right thing to do and both of you will feel better in the long run even if in the short term it sucks. Your trust with that friend will be stronger.\n\nIn terms of your relationship with the girl, you need to consider whether pursuing a romantic relationship with her is worth potentially damaging your friendship. If you do decide to pursue a relationship with her, it's important to be honest with your friend and let them know what's going on. Keeping it a secret could ultimately make things worse and damage your friendship even more.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide what's best for your own emotional wellbeing and your relationships with these two people. Just remember to be honest, take responsibility for your actions, and communicate openly and respectfully with everyone involved.",

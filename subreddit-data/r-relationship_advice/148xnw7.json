    "postText": "My (22F) boyfriend (26M) always talks about his \u2018home girl\u2019 (friend). We have been dating for 4 months. Out of all his friends he talks about his home girl the most and I feel like I know her whole life story. We have a conversation or talk about her at least twice a week. It\u2019s driving me insane. It\u2019s not even that his friend is a woman. It\u2019s the way he makes me feel like he\u2019s rubbing it in my face. We legit just had a conversation about her new bracelet, and her boyfriend being dumb\u2026 I know so much about her life and I don\u2019t even know her. I\u2019d understand if I was also friends with her but I\u2019m not. For example, he talks about her tattoo and how he was impressed and even went to show me pictures of it. As well as what she wants to do with her future career. I might as well date her! I think he may have a crush or be infatuated with her. And I know they speak every week. I don\u2019t even speak to my best friend of 8 years every week or even my guy friends. I low-key want to end the relationship just because I feel like I\u2019m not priority. And I really shouldn\u2019t have to deal with this. Nor do I want to be with someone who may like another person while they\u2019re with me. Is it crazy to end things?\n\nTL;DR Boyfriend is always talking about his home girl and what she does with her life.",

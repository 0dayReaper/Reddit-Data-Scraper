    "postText": "As of recently I\u2019ve started to see my boyfriend with this parental vibe around him and I know it sounds kind of weird, but I\u2019ve been craving and leaning more into him rubbing my back or brushing my hair, putting his hand on the back of my head, even talking to me really softly. I started just feeling like our 2 year age gap (a very small one) makes him some safe authority figure, I\u2019ve even found myself partaking in some age regressive behavior that I\u2019ve never done before. Now it\u2019s a no shit thing as far as, yes, I have issues in my relationship with my father, but why now being much older is this going on? Granted this is my longest relationship being together almost a year but it just feels very out of my own character.",

You might have an emotional need that yearns to be met and this behavior is what is setting the stage for this need to be met.\n\nsecondly, if you feel comfortable doing this, I'd talk to your partner.  let him know how you are feel and see how he feels about it.  That might help you work there these emotions.\n\nThirdly, if all else fails there is the option of talking to a professional to sort out these complicated emotions.  What you are feeling is not unusual at all, but if it bothers you, I'd explore the why in these ways.",

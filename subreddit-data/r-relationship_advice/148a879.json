    "postText": "My friend, who I will refer to as Christine, and I have been friends for 2 years. We are both students studying the same major at university. Life in our city is incredibly expensive (Vancouver), and she has no parental support.\n\nEven with her student loans and part time jobs she simply doesn't have enough money to pay for her tuition, rent, and food. Christine and I were never really that close as she always kind of kept to herself (school, work, home), but a few months ago I noticed that she was not looking that healthy. She never gave a lot of details about her personal situation, but I could imagine that she was not eating that well. After one of our labs I took her for dinner at a sushi place on campus. She kept on saying she couldn't afford it, but I insisted, and bought her dinner. She started crying during the meal saying she was having a hard time paying for food and was starting to go hungry. She also mentioned that she was getting kicked out of her basement suite as her landlord is selling the property.\n\nI simply listened to her worries and offered to help her if she had any problems. She knows that I come from a wealthy family and I could easily help her out on food, and potentially give her a place to crash for a few days. She mentioned she was embarrassed and wouldn't take my charity, but she knew it was coming from a place of concern.\n\nAfter dinner I dropped her home and we parted ways. I then went to the grocery and bought her some food. I went back to her place, rang the doorbell, and left the food at her door. She wouldn't take it until I told her that I would simply leave it there if she didn't. This started a cycle of me doing this every week. When we met I never brought it up and never mentioned it at any time. If her problems were only related to food, then the situation might not be so bad, but she is now about to be kicked out.\n\nThis leads me to the crux of the problem. I am personally attracted to my friend, but that's it. I genuinely don't want to be in a relationship with her as I know that she isn't right for me. She has developed some strong feelings for me. She has offered to enter a friends with benefits relationship with me to \"compensate\" me for the assistance. I turned her down, and told her that I would continue to give her food without the sex, and that she could sleep on my couch while she figured out her living situation.\n\nAt this point I should mention that I am an exchange student from Asia, and she is from a more rural local community. Our outlooks on life, plans for the future, and overall values are just so different. I am currently not dating anyone, but have something going on with another girl who is more my style. My friend insists that she is fine with just the sex and doesn't care about what I do otherwise. She said I should just think of her as my maid. I am now in a weird situation. She has been staying over at my place for the last week. We have not had sex, but she sleeps in my bed (I only have 1 bed) and is honestly pushed me to the limits of my patience lol. The only thing holding me back is the fact that I know she is very inexperienced and not on birth control. I can't shake this feeling that she will get pregnant, and that she is fine with it happening.\n\nI havent told my friends about this problem, but I honestly know that it comes down to me either kicking her out or setting some hard boundaries with her (birth control, no pregnancy, etc). I am just being realistic, as I don't think I can avoid sleeping with her if she lives with me. lol wtf am I doing here., should I just kick her out? Or just make the best of an odd situation? I feel like I'd be taking severe advantage of her, but if I kick her out she'd be destitute.\n\ntl;dr my poor friend is moving in with me and wants to offer sex in exchange for my support.",

Tell her that this is strictly you helping out a friend in need, just like you'd do with any male friend. \n\nExplain to her that her sexual advances are making you uncomfortable and if she continues you will throw her out (even if you don't mean it, just be strict)\n\nListen, you're young and bound to get horny over someone you find attractive, however, taking advantage of her in a time of need is not right, and once she gets on her feet she will resent you for that.\n\nBefore you do ANYTHING romantic or sexual, make sure you're ready to commit to a relationship with her. Yes, you heard that right, having sex with her will make your friendship complicated. \n\nAlso, sleeping with someone you feel might baby-trap you isn't a great thing either. Remember, even sex with contraception can still end up in pregnancy. So before you do anything stupid, think of the consequences.",

It\u2019s too easy to get attached when you are dependent on a person and also sleeping with them (like her), and people can get a little crazy when feelings are involved.  It would also affect the friendship, as well as any other relationships you might want to enter.\n\nIf she really wants to compensate you for the stay, ask her to do something specific, like your laundry, or the weekly deep cleaning / mopping / bathroom, etc.  Or maybe something related to her college work.  Something that has definite monetary value.  I help out a lot of my friends this way - they don\u2019t want charity, so I ask them to do something small so I can say I\u2019m just paying them generously for their talents.  \n\nAnother option would be to offer to pay the deposit on a new place that she could pay back whenever she was able, and then help her move in, get started, food, etc.  i wouldn\u2019t offer her any money you can\u2019t afford to lose.\n\nAnd if you think she is capable, maybe ask around to see if you can find jobs she can apply to.  That kind of networking can also be helpful.\n\nIt\u2019s hard situation to be in for sure.",

The odds that you'll find a girlfriend who is ok with you living with a former FWB is as close to zero as it's going to get.

If you want to have sex with her and maintain your integrity you can\u2019t do it in the current power dynamic that she depends on you for food and shelter, she can\u2019t really provide valid consent because she needs those things to live. Also, once you\u2019ve engaged in that kind of transaction then you are in a really difficult spot that makes it harder to enforce your own boundaries too when you can no longer tolerate her living in your house and your bed. \n\nAny person in this situation will have some limit to how much they can share their home, bed, food, etc before they start to feel resentful. You need to decide what your boundaries are to support her without resentment, and maintain your integrity. You might consider how long you are ok with her staying with you, if you need her to sleep on the couch or buy an air mattress to do this and not get frustrated by waking up with your morning wood next to a woman you are attracted to everyday. If you don\u2019t want to kick her out, plan ahead with her to figure out how she can get on her feet (low income housing, family members, finding a job, etc.) but don\u2019t wait until you just can\u2019t stand the situation anymore and are in a real ethical challenge about kicking her out with no place to go. \n\nIf you are both still interested in a sexual relationship when there is no longer a power dynamic that makes her incapable of valid consent, then explore it at that time.",

Seems unfair on both if they aren't aware of each other etc.\n\nI've got empathy for you both but continuing to sleep in the same bed sends a real mixed message given your \"I don't want to have sex with you\" line.\n\nIs she looking for somewhere else to go? Have you agreed on how long this arrangement will go on? This sounds like a ticking timebomb and while it's a really generous and nice thing you're doing, it also seems like it's begging for disaster if you don't take some reasonable and very basic steps to set boundaries, agree on this situation and also not take advantage of this situation at all and just _be a good friend_.",

Let her crash until she gets back on her feet- if she wants to pay you, hopefully she's able to get a job, but this prostitutioning of herself is a no-go imo, and I would never let my friends do that in their time of need. \n\n\nAlso how are you over here like \"I like another girl so I'm trying to woo her, but my acquaintance here is offering sex so lol\"? Dude, use your brain- just cuz you're attracted to someone doesn't mean you need to have sex.\n\n\nEveryone here is right about letting her sleep on the couch. I honestly feel a lil concerned how you say this here: \n\n\n\"We have not had sex, but she sleeps in my bed (I only have 1 bed) and is honestly pushed me to the limits of my patience lol. The only thing holding me back is the fact that I know she is very inexperienced and not on birth control.\"\n\n\nThe only thing keeping you from using someone for their body is that she's not on bc and inexperienced? But her sleeping on your bed is enough to get you all wound up? Are you sure you're actually a friend of hers? \n\n\n\"I don't think I can avoid sleeping with her if she lives with me.\" If you lack self control, she's better off crashing with another friend imo. \n\n\nOn the other hand, SHE needs to stop pushing your boundaries. You guys are both in your early 20s, both of you guys should know how to communicate by now. She's not being a good friend by pushing sex as payment onto you when clearly, you're fine buying food for her and giving her a place to crash momentarily. I hope your friend knows she doesn't need to use sex to have people who care about her in her life. \n\n\nI'm so sorry for the formatting since I'm on mobile, but basically 1. Set boundaries, 2. If you're truly a friend, sex as payment is never gonna be on the table, 3. If you really can't \"hold yourself back\", she needs to find another place to crash at.",

There is nothing inherently wrong with power differentials in a relationship (I mean *one person* is always going to be more powerful than the other). It all just depends on the people in the relationship (like *all* relationships). Assuming that one side will be non-communicative or evil is just wrong and also not how the world works. A person in a position of power can be just. A person in a position of weakness can be aggressive and manipulative. The only thing a position of power does is change the potential for abuse, but as long as that potential is never realized then it doesn't matter. \n\nLike, a knife is a powerful tool and weapon that can be used to facilitate very evil actions. But wielding a knife isn't an inherently evil act because it can also be used for good and helpful things.",

You either pay out of pocket to help her get settled, or you find a way to live together (granted you cant stomach kicking her out). Just saying dont fuck each other is the advice a child gives. Lets assume that there is genuine attraction, and she does want to start something with you, I mean that makes sense. She gets to be with someone she likes and she no longer has to worry about money. Is there a power imbalance? Yes there is, but that's the same with most relationships lol. All i can say is be kind and understand what she is going through.

She is desperate and willing to prostitute herself for food and a roof and you are abusing your power by  considering it because you can't keep it in your pants. How will she ever say no to you when doing so could make her immediately homeless and hungry? Either be a friend and help her improve her situation and establish boundaries like her sleeping on the couch or air bed or help her to find other arrangements. Don't be the guy that takes advantage of struggling people.",

The laws of the country are naturally in her favour and she can make a legal case against you on a whim.\n\n2. You're considering a romantic relationship with another girl so don't try both sides and just focus on wooing your choice girl.\n\n3. She's destitute and is now using you as a crutch or a living bank account to alleviate her own life, no matter how true it may be.\n\n4. Having a 'maid' who you can have a sexual relationship with may seem like an attractive option at first but not when you're in a position of power over her.\n\n It's neither good for you to partake in such an offer and nor her to degrade herself so.\n\n5. I believe being poor is in no way a crime or fault so I'd suggest you enquire about her own state of finances and check her background in depth, considering she's now sleeping in your bed.\n\n6. Enquire about shelters as other Redditor have commented as it's best for her not to be with you and more importantly, practically living with you.\n\n7. Do not accept her offer for intimacy no matter how tempting you may find it.\n\nI don't judge you for it but have self control bro. \n\nGet a comfortable couch for her in some other room or in the hall in the meantime as you can afford it. \n\nBe a gentleman whilst she's a guest in your house.",

You have something going on with a girl you say is more your style; how would she (or any other woman you are romantically interested in) think or react if they found out you're dating while living with AND HAVING SEX WITH another woman? If you start having sex with your friendly roommate, even if it's transactional, there are going to be a number of women who won't consider you available or a viable option for relationships. Additionally, if you're allowed to continue seeing other women, is your FWB also going to date/have sex with other people? If you're both sharing the one bed, that could make things a little complicated. If your roomie says it's a non-issue because she won't see anyone else but you while she lives with you, that also puts a different sort of pressure on you. \n\nYou've been a generous friend and are trying hard to support her. The second you bring sex into the friendship, your relationship is going to change. If she is not a person you'd consider having a relationship with, do not start having sex with her. Letting someone move in with you, especially when you know they have no other options for housing so you can't really kick them out without feeling horrible, puts you in a delicate position. Letting her move in AND starting a sexual relationship when she's already developed strong feelings for you (and you don't reciprocate them)... this doesn't sound like it's going to be healthy for her OR you.",

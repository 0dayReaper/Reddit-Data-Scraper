    "postText": "So, about a month back\u2026 my boyfriend and I went through a really difficult situation. I had gotten this message from this random girl on Instagram. She sent me a picture of my bf and a picture of his \u201carea\u201d\u2026 I was so confused and confronted him. He was notably shocked and started freaking out. At first he wasn\u2019t really saying much. This person was a scammer and was asking me for money or they\u2019d send our university the pictures. It\u2019s was stupid but they sent me the screenshots of my bf and them messaging. They really didn\u2019t engage all that much. She dm\u2019d him, he didn\u2019t respond till days later. She asked him if he wanted to have fun and he said \u201cwanna play chess\u201d (he plays chess, this was an innocent offer) she says no and sends a picture, and then asks him for one. He sends it. But thats really it. They weren\u2019t talking for a long time and all he did was send the picture. He fessed up, told me all that happened, not a single detail left out, there wasn\u2019t much to fill me in on but he told me the truth. He was scared about getting scammed and knew it was right to tell me instead of lying. He did everything right after this huge wrong\u2026 He never blamed me for this. He made sure my feelings were validated and admitted that what he did was wrong and unfaithful. He asked for help and received it. He was genuinely ashamed and embarrassed but he was trying his best to recover from what happened as well. He\u2019s always been the innocent one. We went to a few of our friends and I consulted some of my really close family\u2026 every single person told me to give him another chance. He\u2019s a guy who has never done anything wrong. The crazy thing is that my super close friends and family are always like \u201coh leave a man who don\u2019t treat you right\u201d and don\u2019t stand by this stuff. But with him, they all genuinely believe it\u2019s an honest mistake. That it\u2019s something I will never get answers to but that he is truly sorry. \n\nThings have been okay since then. We don\u2019t pretend as if it never happened, we talk about it openly and work on how we feel. But I feel like I lost him. I love him a lot and know everyone says \u201cif he loved you then he wouldn\u2019t do that\u201d but like this guy genuinely does love me. It\u2019s sounds like I\u2019m just coming up with a ton of excuses but I\u2019m seriously not. Every single person believes that I should stay with him. I mean, I am staying with him but it feels wrong. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t know why he did it. He\u2019s talked to people and worked through his feelings but still has no answer for why. Granted, when this happened, it was an incredibly hard time for the both of us in our own personal lives. But since then, we\u2019ve really learned to be more open with each other. I just feel stupid for staying with him because all my life I was told \u201cdon\u2019t stay with a cheater\u201d but here I am\u2026 staying with one and everyone thinks I should too. Am I missing something? I just don\u2019t know what to do\u2026",

But cheating is purposeful and premeditated. \n\nIf you want to stay, you should definitely require that he explains and rationalizes his behavior. He can't keep saying that he doesn't know why he did it. If he can analyze that, it's more likely he will not make the same mistake in the future. \n\nNaturally, you're the only one who can decide whether you want to forgive and overcome this mistake. Nobody will judge you if you don't. It would be a perfectly understandable choice.",

Of course, the size of this fck up is rather small, so as an experience to learn from and not stray again it is more good.\n\nHowever, I wonder if you feel like, staying with him is not your decision. Rather, that you didn't get to make this decision, and it was made for you, by everyone you know insisting you stay with him.\n\nI should say, given your info, yes, staying with him is the better choice to make in my mind. However, this is only in isolation. What matters the most is how you feel about it. Then again something is strange, here you feel stupid for staying with him, because everyone tells you to do so, but feel like you should leave, cause you have been told to do so in such cases in the past?\n\nWhat is it really that YOU want? I think you should take a break in relationship. A break that means you still are in relationship, and are exclusive and all that should be stated in no uncertain terms, however you need space and time to think of things by yourself... or that is how I see that at least.",

    "postText": "Wife and I have been together since high school. Married for 10 years. I'm really drunk, so pardon me for this gibberish. \n\nMy wife's best friend Megan and I work for the same company( different departments ). So yesterday, she wanted to meet me after work and told me that she had to tell me something. So I met her and she immediately broke down and started crying. I tried to console her and asked if something was wrong and she told me that my wife and her husband were having an affair. \n\nAccording to her, this affair has been going on for years and she also told me that her husband was my daughter's biological father. She confronted her husband and he didn't deny anything. \n\nAnd when I confronted my wife, she tried to deny everything but when I told her that Megan told me about it, she broke down and started crying. \n\nI really don't know what to do. I mean, everything was a lie right? My little girl Taylor is not mine and my wife blatantly faked everything for years. What do I live for now? I just don't know what to do. Just here for some advice. I'm sorry if this felt like a rant.",

(But if you do feel this way, don\u2019t wait for years to sever the bond)\n\nJust wanted you to know that however you feel is valid. It\u2019s ok to want to stay in her life. It\u2019s also ok to decide to leave. \n\nIt\u2019s a blessing she is so young. If you decide to make a radical change, it won\u2019t affect her adult life as much.",

I don\u2019t see that being possible at this point unless everything stays exactly the same. Not OP\u2019s fault. Her mother created this mess.",

Till you have a relationship with a child, you kind of just imagine them as not really people till they\u2019re a little older. But the bond between a caregiver and child can be very strong very early. and a three year old would definitely notice if daddy just up and disappeared. Would definitely cause some bonding and abandonment issues.",

But, after three years, I wouldn't care if I learned that their biological father was literally Hitler, I wouldn't love them any less.\n\nI can imagine that you might question your relationship with your daughter in the heat of the moment right now, but don't let it make you do or say anything you will regret when the fog clears and you remember how much you love her.\n\nEDIT: To those responding about how she's not his child, before I engage in debate, please indicate whether or not you have ever raised a child from infancy to three years of age as your own. Because I have, and as much as I hate playing the \"you have to be a parent to understand\" card, this is really the absolute epitome of \"you have to be a parent to understand.\"\n\nEDIT #2: OP should start divorce proceedings against his wife first thing after he talks to a lawyer. ~~And he should get his lawyer to fight for zero child support (because a child support agreement is a legal bond tying him to the woman who betrayed him).~~ I don't know why people are suggesting I said otherwise. But he should also wait until he cools down before he makes any rash decisions about his *relationship* with his daughter. If he still feels then that he wants to walk away from that relationship, it's probably best that he does. But I think it is unlikely that he will feel that way, and suggest that he be careful not to do anything now that he will regret if and when he decides he wants to stay in Taylor's life.\n\nEDIT #3: I did not intend to imply that I knew anything about family law. I don't. And we don't even know what state (or country, for that matter) OP is in. My point was that OP should obviously not feel guilty about having his lawyer pursue whatever is best for OP. A lot of replies are talking about obligation as though I suggested that OP has one. I don't think he is obligated to do anything. But I do think that he has a very important relationship with a human being who probably worships him, and he may want to take a long sober second thought before walking away from that.",

I had gained a bunch of weight during our relationship and she'd basically make fun of me when i was considering work out plans and would talk about how i couldn't maintain it. Well, I've dropped about 45% of my starting body weight and I'm never going back. Through all this I've realized that if life burns you down, become a fucking phoenix and rise above it. Im in a really good place now... if anybody's struggling with the dregs of life, hit me up, I'm good at making strategies of self improvement &amp; have been helping others.",

In many states, you can be held liable for child support if you don't take action by separating as soon as you discover the truth. I know you aren't ready to decide what you want long-term right now, but you may need to take some action to make sure that all options are still available when you're ready to decide.\n\nEdit: I put this in some other comments, but I just want to clarify: I'm not telling you what actions to take, just that you need to inform yourself about what options and restrictions exist for you wherever you live. Yes, the best way to do that would be to contact an attorney.\n\nTo some of the people that replied to me with the obvious/common recommendation to not leave the family home: Yes, this is almost always the best advice. *However,* it is the law in some U.S. states that failure to physically separate within a certain timeframe after discovering a child is not biologically yours means you are liable for child support. I don't know specific laws by state, but I've seen examples where that limit ranges from a few weeks to over a year. He needs to know what the rules are where he lives, and if he's not 100% committed to raising another man's child, it might be better for him to lose the house than have to pay child support for 15 years.",

If this this how you feel (seeing her as a manifestation of the betrayal), it might actually be worse for your daughter if you try and stick around because your resentment towards your wife and her betrayal might manifest in how you treat your daughter.

It's up to bio mother and father to bring up the child in a reasonable way if you do think it's best to leave.\n\nI think focusing on yourself might be a good idea for now and then when you're more grounded, decide what you'd like to do.",

Do not tell her you do you or do not want parental rights to your daughter. Do not refuse to help care for your daughter. I know this will probably be the hardest thing you\u2019ll ever have to do, but if she is yours, or if she is not but you want to have parenting rights, do not do anything she can use against you.\n\nAbove all, take the highroad at every opportunity. When my ex left me and our three kids for another woman, the best advice I got was this: \u201cfrom now on, you better look like a Mother Fucking Teresa. Anytime you want to do or say something crazy, think about how that\u2019s going to look in front of a judge when you\u2019re telling him you want custody of your kids.\u201d\n\nEdit it to add a couple more thoughts\u2026 I\u2019ve been divorced six years now. My kids are now eight, 10 and 12. I have a great job, a great little house that\u2019s all mine, and an amazing boyfriend who also experienced infidelity in his marriage and completely understand some of my fears and worries. Life really does get better. I promise.\n\nAlso, if you know any attorneys, ask them who they would want representing them in a divorce. If you don\u2019t know any attorneys, ask people you know who know attorneys to ask around. And if you that doesn\u2019t work either, check out Aveo and Martindale for some of the top lawyers in your area. And don\u2019t go with somebody three years out of law school, or somebody who also does bankruptcy, criminal, business, and every other kind of law. With a case this fucked up, you will need somebody who does FAMILY law and family law only.",

A couple points to consider.\n\nThere is a good possibility that OP's wife and affair partner may ultimately end up getting married to raise their daughter together as a family.  Even if he chooses to stay involved in the child's life, OP will be an outsider to her in this scenario. She will grow up knowing the two of them as mom and dad - which they are.\n\nSecond, the affair apparently went on for YEARS with the two lovers always knowing it was their child - not OP's. The two of them must have had many conversations about their daughter, sharing intimate moments together while OP was home raising her and providing for her.\n\nThis is pure evil.

Or, if you don't think you can be the father Taylor needs now that you know the truth, demand a paternity test, divorce the lying, cheating individual and never see either again. ETA: What you actually should do realistically because I don't have actual legal knowledge is contact a divorce attorney immediately, meet with them, tell them exactly what would be your ideal outcome and let them help you through it. Personally I would want to stick it to the stbx as hard as humanly possible, but most people probably aren't as vindictive as I am.",

I know your life is a train wreck not of your doing but you absolutely need to put aside your grief for a few hours and speak to an attorney.  Once you get a game plan from them, please allow yourself all the time you need to grieve....be angry, be sad, be introspective, no one will fault you for any reaction you\u2019ll have from this.  I will also suggest you think long and hard about the little girl.  Trauma, especially emotional trauma, at that age has lasting repercussions that she may never fully be able to recover from.  If you love Taylor, fight for her and make bio dad and bio mom pay you child support on top of spousal support.  Whatever you\u2019ll need to take care of her yourself.  Please reach out to family and trusted friends.  You will need lots of support to get through.  My heart goes out to you.  I wish I had something magical to say to make this ok.",

Getting a paternity test and a lawyer right away as everyone says is a good idea. I am so sorry. Surround yourself with support and real friends. Your wife's friend might be particularly helpful and you can be supports for one another because the two of you can really relate to each other's pain right now.

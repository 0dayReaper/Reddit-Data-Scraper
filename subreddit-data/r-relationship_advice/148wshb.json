    "postText": "My best friend Lee has a habit of saying really hurtful things when she\u2019s angry, stressed or down. I\u2019m not the only one she snaps at. Her partner gets the blunt of the cruel comments. I\u2019ve talked to her in the past and she\u2019s apologized, saying it won\u2019t happen again. But it does.\n\nLee is currently unemployed and really angry about it - and is now lashing out at everyone - myself included. I\u2019ve tried all I can to cheer her up and be compassionate but, recently, she said something hurtful that I can\u2019t get out of my head. \n\nShe apologized after I confronted her. I told her I forgave her - but the truth is, I still feel super hurt. And now, I don\u2019t feel like being around Lee at all and can\u2019t help but return to the hurtful comment over and over again. \n\nLee is starting to notice me pulling away. I even bailed on an expensive vacation with her and our friend group purely because I just don\u2019t want to be around her. I know this is childish. How can I move on? How do I really forgive my friend and forget what she said? \n\nThe Back Story:\nA month ago, my best friend, Lee, and I found out our mutual friend, James, was part of a round of layoffs at his company. He was offered a significant sum of money as severance to sign an NDA, finish out a big project and leave the job on a positive note. The number was in the six figure range which is more money than i make in a year. I understand that everything is relative, but money is money - and when there\u2019s extra on the table, I firmly believe that unless it\u2019s illegal or against your ethics, you should put your ego aside and take the money. None of these apply to James\u2019 situation. He was simply unlucky - last one hired and the first one fired. So I said this. And immediately Lee got super mad.\n\nIn Lee\u2019s opinion, James should tell the company fuck you and walk away with pride. Lee quit her job last year without having a new one. She hasn\u2019t been able to find work since and I think my comment triggered her. I guess Lee made a similar salary to James. \n\nLee snapped at me, saying that I wouldn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have money or what James financial situation is like. She then said the thing I can\u2019t unhear.\n\nThe comment:\n\nLee said: \u201cWell, klg301, you have nothing and no one so you can\u2019t even begin to comment on what James should do.\u201d\n\nFor context:\n\nI went through a very difficult divorce recently. I moved all my stuff into storage, sold my home, left my abusive ex husband, went into counseling, and got back on my feet after living with my family for two years. Just six months ago, I moved across the country to where my best friend and main friend group lives. I live out of a cute month to month rental and have three suitcases to my name. \n\nI\u2019m the happiest I\u2019ve ever been and even though I don\u2019t have a lot of money, I\u2019m not broke by any means. I would love to have a partner again one day - and it makes me sad that I\u2019m single in this part of my life. \n\nLee knows this and has been instrumental in helping me acclimate to my new town - introducing me to my new landlady and a new group of friends.\n\nTo thank Lee for helping me, I\u2019ve tried to do nice things for her. I designed a massive 70 page pitch presentation for her for free. I also threw her a very expensive birthday party and bought her $200 worth of alcohol, a birthday gift, and a separate birthday dinner, too. I like to share with people I care about. \n\nThe nothing and no one comment really hurt after all that. It felt like a slap in the face.\n\nMy Question:\nI\u2019m not sure how to let go of the nothing and no one comment. Mostly because Lee is not wrong. I\u2019m single and have nothing of value. I don\u2019t own a home or property. I live very frugally. I only have a storage unit and three suitcases. I have no pets and no spouse any more. My car is a 20 year old beater but completely paid off. In the scheme of things, I\u2019m not an impressive person with flashy clothes or a yacht. I\u2019ve got nothing to my name and no one that loves me.\n\nAdmitting that hurts to the core \u2014 especially after loosing so much. Now I feel ashamed to be around her and other successful people when I\u2019m so clearly out of their league. I also feel stupid because for a long time I felt like my friend and I shared core values. But it seems that might not be the case. Plus, it hurts to know this is how my friend sees me - a loser who has nothing and no one. Ugh. \n\nTL;DR: I know I said I forgave her, but how do I forget and move on?",

You had good times together but now - especially since she's even worse - you could let her go. Ending this friendship (or just spending less time with her) would show her that she needs to change or she will just push her away. You've already started the distancing process. If you continue to be BFFs, you'll have to acknowledge that this same kind of thing will probably happen again.",

After everything you\u2019ve done to turn your life around you deserve peace. But I don\u2019t necessarily think Lee deserves absolution.\n\nI\u2019m honestly shocked she has any friends if this is how she operates in life. Maybe she needs to start feeling some consequences for her words? \n\nAs far as pulling out of the vacation\u2026 I hope you\u2019re not out a ton of money. But again I don\u2019t think it\u2019s childish to distance yourself. Who knows if something or someone will set Lee off and ruin that??? Who needs that ON VACATION? \n\nAs far as wanting to have some big conversation or something: that\u2019s your call. If you think you can stomach group hangs where you can bail out if she gets to be too much/use others as a buffer then go for it. But pulling back from her and having some distance feels like a healthy option. If she calls you on it, I think you can tell her that this pattern (because it is a pattern, yes?) of her lashing out and being unnecessarily cruel isn\u2019t working for you and you need some space. I\u2019m willing to bet she will once again lash out (you\u2019re too sensitive, she\u2019s going through a lot, you\u2019re not perfect either) and all you can do is remain calm and stand your ground. You can\u2019t control or change her but you can control your participation in this friendship.",

It may have been transient, or it may be something she thinks often and just doesn\u2019t usually say aloud - you cannot know frequency, but you DO know that at least once, that\u2019s how she viewed you.m, and she didn\u2019t care if you knew it.\n\nIt appears that your relationship with her is merely friendly rather than friends.  \n\nFriendly folks can be a fun companion and even help you when you\u2019re in a bad spot, but real friends love you enough to neither  think nor say shit like that.  \n\nAccepting her apology is fine, but she\u2019s been an adult long enough to know that some utterances can\u2019t be fixed with an apology and some things cannot be unsaid - this was one of those times, and knowing how vicious she\u2019s willing to be, you cannot see her or your friendship the same way.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to remain friendly with her, but it\u2019s also okay to explain that you really don\u2019t see her as a friend any longer, and you  need some time and space to recalibrate your thoughts on the relationship because you did love her as a true friend, and now you cannot get beyond merely friendly.",

You don\u2019t need this person. It doesn\u2019t matter if you apologize but continue to do the same thing. \n\nLee relies on people being too weak or afraid to rock the boat to realize she\u2019s a garbage friend who needs professional help. Having a partner is not the most important thing in your life now and not having one does not make you less worthy. Go find other, better friends to be around and don\u2019t measure yourself against Lee. Find a hobby. Join a group or a league if some sort. You\u2019ve already started the process of moving on Continue and don\u2019t let anyone pressure you to be around someone who makes you feel bad. Remember the abusive relationship you left?

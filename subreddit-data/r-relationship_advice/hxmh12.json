I wanted to do it. And I tried.. but it was just the same thing all over again. She started to cry, she kept calling and leaving crying voice mails that she's gonna do it. I just didn't know what to do. So I told her that we can stay together... but I'm just so broken.\n\nShe was always being mean to me and she always bullied me, at least for the last 2 years or so. She calls me ugly, makes fun of me and always tries to humiliate me. I was used to do that and I just kind of took it as it were. That I can't do anything about it.\n\nBut lately she started hitting me. Now, I'm 6'3\" and she's 4'11\" so it's not that it's painful physically, but it just hurts emotionally so much. Whenever we get into an argument she punches me in the face. Or in the stomach. I'm just broken and lost. I've lost all my confidence, I lost all my friends because she didn't like any of them. And it just sucks.\n\nI just accepted that this is how my life is and it's probably not gonna change. I'm so sorry for disappointing everyone who believed that I can do it.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nAlso, I'm not from the United States. The Police won't assist me in the break up, they don't have any 72hr psych and they told me that they can't do anything unless she actually tries to kill herself. \n\nEDIT: I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna drive to see her tomorrow, take my parents with me as support and I'm gonna end it. I just can't anymore. Thank you guys.\n\n[update on the situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hxmh12/update_my_24m_girlfriend_21f_keeps_threatening_to/fzflu41?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)",

            "comment": "You need to leave without her knowing or set yourself a time limit and block her number, because you are actually in an abusive relationship.\n\nI am 1 year free of mine now, he would always threaten to kill him self. It was unbearable thinking he might do it, one night I came home and there was a shotgun on the shoe rack.\n\nOne day I couldn\u2019t take it any more, I jumped up without a word and just started packing and didn\u2019t stop. The entire time he screamed, cried and hurled abuse at me, even threatened to kill ME then himself.\n\nI just kept going, my heart was in my mouth and I was shaking the entire time but I didn\u2019t say a WORD. I didn\u2019t even look at him, just kept packing my overnight suitcase. \n\nI ran out of the house, called a taxi, jumped in and never looked back. I blocked his number when I reached my destination and had about 70 messages, all the same bullshit. Don\u2019t get me wrong, he did try to contact me for about 6 months, but each time I just blocked and blocked again without even reading the messages. Now, I hear nothing from him. I know he\u2019s not dead as I would have heard by now.\n\nI\u2019m not saying there isn\u2019t a possibility that your girlfriend isn\u2019t serious, but I AM saying that it is 100% not your problem and 100% not your responsibility.\n\nWhen you get into a relationship with someone you sign a verbal and spiritual contract. You agree to be respectful, to be courteous and to *care* for that person. You are a team and you are equals, and you should never deliberately hurt that person. \nIf you do deliberately hurt that person you\u2019ve broken the contract and essentially forfeit the right to be in that persons life, yes they may forgive you but they are under no obligation to. There is no way to get back trust once it\u2019s broken, no matter what people think.\n\nYour girlfriend has broken the contract and continues to put herself before you, she does not value you, she does not love you, she does not respect you. She only values, loves and respects herself. She wishes to control you in any way she can, and she has found her way. She will NEVER release you from these bonds, you must release yourself. It won\u2019t be easy, but it WILL be worth it, because believe me there is a life outside of this and outside of her. \n\nIf you stay, you will regret it for the rest of your life, I swear to you.",

I too was in a relationship where my partner was constantly verbally and psychology abusing me. Anytime there was an argument, which he would start, it would always devolve into if I left he was going to kill himself. He threatened to kill us both several times. I finally got to the point where I didnt care if I died at least it would be over and I left. He did the most half assed suicide attempt I've ever seen and was picked up and put in the hospital. The cuts weren't even deep enough to need stiches. I dropped things off for him, like an idiot, and he continued to verbally abuse me in front of the nurses. To the point a nurse said I should leave for my own wellbeing. It was all him just tryingnto have control over me. He's pathetic excuses of a human and a complete waste of space. I am so much happier and healthier without him.",

Similar situations happen a lot because of \"what if\" -  it doesnt matter. Noone can get the help they need by being FORCED and you cant make a person think less negatively or change the chemical makeup of their brain... I see all to much similar reasons for why people stay in abusive relationships or end up killing themselves because of a family member doing it. Or a wife does because the husband did it and guilt. You absolutely are in no way responsible for another adult human.. maybe some of their shitty decisions if you raised them but that's it. You dont think for them. You dont make them make their decisions.",

She would always say she was just in a bad place mentally and expected me to just understand and help her out. While completely controlling all decisions made, because she was depressed. But for the two years I was dating her she didn't do anything to make herself feel better. It was crushing me as a person &amp; before I met her I was the happiest person I knew.

Try to recognize overall moody anonymous chat where they keep returning without being able to be sure it's the same person. I had a period where I liked drawing and wanted to learn/compare with others over time. You have online drawing games with chat for that and it's mostly kids and some adults with the same idea as me. Omg those chats are a cesspool of 'i want to kill myself' and others laughing about it. Most fake it and laugh it off by the end of the chat, but some exploit it to control others and make them feel bad. Seen one really ploying for a week and making the sob story more dramatic day by day. At one point it became obvious the situation was impossible, but the way others were wrapped around that persons' finger the day before was amazing. Faking a fight against him/her through multiple personas under constantly changing nicknames (possible in some chats), daily ending up in horrible suicide threats where those in the room had to take action or they'd be the reason he/she would die that evening, dragging that on for hours.\n\nNever felt so disgusted of someones personality in my life. It's incredibly hard to recognize online, but that makes it easy to come to the conclusion others gave: get out, it's not your responsibility.\n\nI first fell for it, then after realizing it was a daily thing, tried exposing the person through tricks like recognizing speech patterns etc until that person realized it and started playing victim personas too. Then i left and messaged the admin email this is a critical issue on their specific chat. They fixed it not much later.\n\nSo if you recognize that: don't try to manage the situation, it's impossible and very stressful. You activate those who have the power to do something about it.\n\nI still get shivers from the power that one person had over other daily visitors. Fully anonymous chats should be 1000% blocked by parents. Kids site or not. I visited gore/extreme porn/.. sites for a challenge with classmates as kid but that's completely safe looking back to it. Anonchat is actually dangerous and it's (probably?) not blocked by the parenting filters. The big games handle it correctly. Free niche kid games are a problem.\n\nSorry for the hijack, i hope this helps others recognize when they are in the area of control of abusive people. I got a bit off track on this one.",

If you can disappear from her and block all contact, do. If you don\u2019t have strength, gather others and use their strength. If you think she will try to hurt herself tell anyone that would care about it and play the recordings for evidence. It is not easy to leave, but you must leave her behind and move on. I\u2019m not sure how far away you can get, but go as far as possible. You can even just leave a note and go, or don\u2019t and let her figure it out.

I called in sick to work one day and moved out while he was at work. Now years and lots of therapy later, I realized that back then I thought I deserved that kind of \u201clove\u201d. I grew up in an abusive house and fell right into that same type of relationship. I know this person feels like your whole life right now and that she needs you, but you have your whole life ahead of you and you can\u2019t fix her. Let her go, get yourself into counseling and focus on getting yourself healthy. I\u2019m in an amazing relationship now and I\u2019ve never been happier. You can have that for yourself too.",

When I was in the relationship and got 40 messages in my inbox, I couldn't help but read and that sometimes they say things that you can't help but reply to. So not reading the messages is very important.  \n\nBut I think that's part of the abuse, they know how they can take advantage of you and use it to say things that would prompt a reply.",

Contact a few former friends on they sly, tell them you're sorry for letting them go, that you didn't realize it was an early step in an abusive relationship, and ask them if they can give you a place to stay for a night or two while you get something longer term worked out. Block her before you even leave, and leave while she isn't there or asleep. Leave a letter telling her it's over and to never contact you again. She will most likely not kill herself - she is too selfish of a person, first of all, and second, without you there to be hurt by it, she has no audience and therefore no motivation to make threats or an attempt.",

They don\u2019t do it because it\u2019s not rooted in them wanting to die, it\u2019s rooted in power. Why would they ever back off of the ultimate power mood.\n\nLots of people are genuinely suicidal, but those are rarely the same people using the idea of it for their gains. It\u2019s an abuser tactic that\u2019s as common as dirt, and I\u2019ve yet to hear of anyone going through with it in this circumstance. They just go find a new victim and do it to them.\n\nAnd honestly, let her die if she wants to. It\u2019s not your job to keep her alive, it\u2019s not worth your life to prop up her\u2019s (which she seems determined to make as miserable as she can.)",

I went no contact after years of trying to set up appropriate boundaries and watching her stomp all over them. \n\nShe killed herself last year after alienating everyone who ever loved her. She died alone. She died unloved. But that was her choice, and I don't feel guilty for pulling away from her dumpster fire to protect myself and my kids. \n\nIt's her life. Her choice. Her consequences. OP has no responsibility for the things she does, and good for him if he decides he is worth more than the squished turds she's offering him. He IS worth more.",

So thank you, kind internet strangers.\n\nSecond of all, I need to say that I did not expect to get so much abuse. The amount of people calling me a p*ssy or abusing me in messages and telling me that I deserve it was sickening and it really shows that there's a stigma about men in abusive relationships.\n\nNow onto the update. I texted her yesterday and told her that I want to meet her today. I didn't tell her why obviously, because she would have declined. I left to go there early in the morning, picked up my parents and drove to hers. Not gonna lie, my heart was absolutely pounding the whole drive. I knew that it wasn't gonna be easy and that it's not gonna be nice, but I was finally fed up.\n\nWhen I got there, my parents waited for me in the car and I just went straight to her and started talking. I told her that this is it. That the relationship is over and that I don't want spend not even one more second being with her. I told her that she absolutely crushed me and destroyed my confidence and that I can't live like this anymore. \n\nShe started crying and screaming insults at me. She obviously started saying that she's gonna kill herself. For the first time ever I just calmly told her that she's an adult and that she can do whatever she wants. That no matter what she says or do, I just won't stay with her anymore. I could see that she was shocked and I was trying my absolute best not to start crying. I knew that I needed to be strong now. I told her to throw away all the stuff of mine that she still might have and not to contact me anymore. I wished her good luck and left. I didn't even let her say anything. And I just felt like the biggest asshole ever. But I knew it was the right thing.\n\nI went back into my car, told my parents that it's done and we talked for a bit. I blocked her on all social media, I made all my accounts private, I have a new phone number and I'm gonna look into getting some therapy, because I'm honestly not sure where to go next in life. But I know one thing for sure, I'm gonna take some time off work next week and go on a trip somewhere. Something that I haven't been able to do in more than 2 years.\n\nThank you again for all your support. Your guys' kind words are what finally made me realize that I can't live like this anymore. I know that it's gonna be hard. I know that she will try to make contact. But I'm gonna make it.",

I'm really proud of you for taking care of yourself and stepping away from this relationship that was very damaging to you. \n\nAbusers often pull moves like this (physical abuse, emotional abuse, threatening suicide) to get their partner to stay with them, but in reality they really need to seek help on their own to address their deep-seated issues (e.g. insecurity, low self-esteem, mental illness, etc). You cannot do that for them. And if you stay, it only continues and gets worse.\n\nThank you for being brave enough to come out and express what you were experiencing and making the right moves for yourself despite all the hatred!

I am so happy you have decided to end it and are bringing your parents with you for support.\n\nI think, after this is done, you should seek therapy. Male victims of domestic violence often have a harder time finding resources or being taken seriously by care providers, but I still think it\u2019s an important step in the healing process.\n\nI also want to point out that everything she\u2019s doing is textbook classic abuse: alienating you from your friends, manipulating you into staying with her by threatening harm to herself or others, hitting you... it doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s 4\u201911 and you\u2019re over 6 feet, she knows you won\u2019t hit back and the violence will continue to escalate. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re much bigger, she could still attack you when you\u2019re vulnerable and cause you serious physical damage or even death. \n\nThere aren\u2019t a ton of resources online specifically for male victims of DV but it may help to take a look at this:\n\n\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/domestic-violence-against-men/art-20045149\n\nPlease also from these comments listen to the voices of previous abuse victims over the voices of people who have never been there before. There are a lot of garbage comments with terrible advice on this thread. Please know that you are worthy of being safe and that is the most important thing right now.\n\nPlease take care, OP.  I\u2019ll keep you in my thoughts.",

Do make an exit plan: save some money, find a place to live - preferably far away, leave silently with no explanation when she is not around, and then have no contact at all with her.",

            "comment": "This is so so heart breaking to read. Please, I actually beg of you, break up with her. If she cared for YOU at all, she wouldn't do ANY of the things that she is and has done. You just need to get away from her. This is not love. You do not want to spend your life with this physcopath. She needs help and you are not thaf help. You cannot change her. She needs time away from this relationship almost as much as you do.\n\nI promise you, staying with her is NOT helping. In fact you're probably making her irrationality and poor mindset worse because she knows that the vile method she is using is working.\n\nPlease please please, get out of there.\n\nMy advice would be to get any and ALL evidence. Contact a Solicitor/Attorney and immediately seek a restraining order. Contact the police and file a report - you're not pressing charges but it will act as a record to be used later. Block her on everything. Everything. Contact her family. And send everybody you feel necessary the evidence you have. If you live near or with her then get out of town. Spend some nights with friends or family, preferably ones she wouldn't think to contact.\n\nIn fact. I wouldn't even suggest breaking up with her in person. You could say nothing and just disappear. Or you could send a short and simple text and straight up do all of the above.\n\nThere are ways out of this so do not torment yourself because otherwise I think the tables will flip. Nobody has a right to do this to anybody. You need to get out of there. For both of you. But most importantly for yourself.\n\nImagine being free from her manipulative, vindictive and abusive behaviour. It would be bliss and you could rebuild yourself, heal, find out who you really are and do what YOU need to do. You're not her therapist. She needs one. But it's not you. She needs serious help. Nobody would blame you for leaving or for anything she did as a result of you leaving.\n\nIt would not be your fault. She is a disgusting person and probably too silly to follow through. Get some professional help legally (police and Solicitors) and get some professional help for your own mental health (therapists). If you have the money, go on holiday or away for a while. It'll do you a world of good.\n\nI am seirosuly begging you. God forbid something worse happen to you in a fight or she baby traps you. Imagine a child in the middle of this mess. She is not mentally sound. You don't love her. You loved her. The life you had. The girl you knew. And more than anything, you're afraid to move on for risk of change, experiencing life without her and the stupid threats she makes. In fact you could call the police for an anonymous safety check once you've done very thing you needed to do to get out of there.\n\nJust do what you need to do out of respect for yourself and for everybody who cares for you. If the situation doesn't change, neither will she and she'll be stuck an abusive mess for the rest of her life too. Also think of the repercussions if she keeps pushing you. Can you guarantee a cool head?\n\nYou can do this. I 1000% believe that you can. Make this your survival story and not the story of how your life went down hill and you just gave up on happiness.\n\nYou said you're broken. So fix this mess. You are not responsible for ANY of her manipulative behaviour that may follow.",

Let professionals handle it - she will either get help OR she'll be caught lying about it and know that's not a tactic she can use.\n\nShe is emotionally blackmailing you, so grab the book by Susan Forward \"Emotional Blackmail\" and read it to understand what you're dealing with. \n\nYou don't have to put up with this and you are living in a cage that doesn't even have locks or doors on it, it's all in your mind. Ditch her, disappear, block her number.\n\nIf you don't think you're strong enough to do it right now then plan on going somewhere and staying there where she can't find you for a time. Yes, I do advocate disappearing when it comes to abusive relationships if for no other reason than to give yourself time to pull out of the mental brainwashing she's doing to you. \n\nI'm not disappointed in you by the way. It takes many people several tries to leave an abusive relationship. It took me two big ones and bunch of smaller attempts before I left an abusive relationship, so I have empathy for you. But you really need to ask yourself at this stage why you're surrendering your whole life for someone who holds suicide over your head as a weapon. \n\nAlso just to lay that myth to rest if you're worried about it - you wouldn't be charged with anything if she did kill herself. This comes up a lot and there has been one case where that happened, but it was because the woman who was charged knew the guy was in the middle of a suicide attempt and she urged him to finish it when he wanted to stop and pushed him to do so. She didn't call for help. She didn't tell anyone where he was. That's why she was charged. That is not the same as telling people like this girl's parents or 911 that she's threatening suicide and then leaving.\n\nBut the chances are really highly likely she is just doing this to control you. Regardless you need to step aside and let the professionals handle her and get yourself free. You can do this. I still believe you can.",

                            "comment": "She also often gives great advice on how to stay safe when leaving an abusive relationship. When abusers feel they are losing their grasp on the victim they often intensify the abuse and can act out violently towards the victim, including when the victim is male and the abuser is female. **Leaving an abusive relationship is the most dangerous phase of the abusive relationship.**\n\nYour (soon-to-be-ex)GF has already resorted to using violence regularly and without much concern for your safety. This is a major line to cross. It doesn't matter if she actually injures you, hitting you is violence in itself and it is unacceptable.\n\nShameless [copy/paste](https://blog.zencare.co/how-to-safely-leave-an-abusive-relationship/) because all this information can be important:Safety plan for leaving an abusive relationship:\n\n* **Let a friend or family member know you are ending your relationship.** Even if you don\u2019t want to tell your friend or family member about the abuse, let them know you are ending your relationship, and need emotional support. Let them know when and where you are ending the relationship, and ask them to check in on you.\n* **Call a hotline.** If you are uncomfortable talking with someone you know, call one of the hotlines and speak with someone who will encourage and support you.\n* **Keep important documents safe.** This includes your passport, birth certificate, health insurance card etc, and those of your children. Keep these in a safe space, preferably out of the home.\n* **Find a safe place to go, even for a few nights**\n* **Call 911** **if your partner hurts you,** threatens to hurt you, or threatens to hurt themselves\n* **Memorize a few emergency contact numbers,** in case you leave without your phone.\n* **Change passwords** **on electronic devices and social media,** as your partner may know your passwords.\n* **Block your partner from calling or texting you.** You may need to be in touch again, but it is best to stop communication right after leaving.\n* **Prepare emergency funds.** This can include emergency money and your own bank account or credit card if possible\n* **Remind yourself that you do not deserve to be abused.** Write down in a journal or somewhere safe why you are important and do not deserve to be abused. Read and reread this to give you strength.\n\nAfter leaving the relationship make sure to take care of yourself. Often the real damage only becomes visible after leaving.  Victims of an abusive relationship often suffer from mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, low self-worth, and can have symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.

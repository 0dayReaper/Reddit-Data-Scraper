    "postText": "Firstly, sorry if this has been posted twice. Reddit flagged my first one and I tried to edit it but don't think it worked.\n\nMe and my boyfriend have been dating for a year and 4 months. Definitely my longest relationship and honestly, I believed I would marry him someday. \n\nHe works overseas so I don't see him for about 8 months of the year. Other than missing him it never really bothered me because I trusted him completely and was willing to go through long distance for him. I should also clarify ( I didn't originally ) we dated for a 11 months before he moved overseas for work so we did date normally for a long period of time. \n\nYesterday he sent me a screenshot of something in his phone and I happened to notice the tinder notification. When I first questioned him about it, he lied and said it was a reddit notification ( I obviously knew that was a lie because I am a redditer ). Later on he came clean about lying and said that he downloaded tinder and made a fake account using some random pictures he found on insta and was using it to make friends because he was lonely. \n\nNow granted, I understand that working alone in a foreign country can get lonely and it's nice to have someone to console you and talk to but for the last week he hasn't spoken to me much because he was busy. I completely understood that because he has a very demanding job but I'm incredibly hurt that he couldn't find the time to talk to me but he found the time to download tinder, make a fake account ( that is if what he told me was actually true ) and then match and talk to random people ( women ). \n\nI have no issue with him having friends, in fact I try to encourage him to get out and meet people our age and enjoy himself but I do have a problem with him trying to meet \"friends\" on an app that has a algorithm that is designed to match you with people who you are likely to be attracted to and want a relationship with. \n\nThere are many apps that are designed with a purpose of making friends and if not solely to make friends, then they offer the potential of making friends ( like discord etc ). \n\nI'm super hurt and I don't know what to feel and I don't know if I should believe him at this point. He's never given me a reason to not trust him but in the last while he made comments that, now looking back, are suspicious but at the time just brushed it off. Another strange thing is that he also recently downloaded snapchat. He's had it before but deleted it because he isn't really the social media type but he now got it since he has been overseas again and he doesn't snap me...like at all.\n\nSo my question is, do you think he is cheating? Or can guys download and have tinder for innocent reasons?",

That might fly sometimes for women, but no woman, man, or anyone else is going to go meet up with a guy who's cagey about showing his face unless he's paying them.\n\nYour boyfriend is a terrible liar and definitely hooking up with other people.

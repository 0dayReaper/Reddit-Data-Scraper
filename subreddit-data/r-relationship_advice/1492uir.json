    "postText": "I\u2019m (22 F) in a relatively new relationship (22M) (have been dating for about 5 months now) that is so so healthy and good for me and I am so happy but my boyfriend rarely compliments me or tells me how he feels about me. I want to bring this up to him but I don\u2019t know how. \n\nHe is great at showing his affection in other ways but he is just not very expressive with his words. I am the complete opposite and always feel the need to tell people how highly I think of them (when it\u2019s true lol) whether it\u2019s a SO, family member, friend, etc. but his lack of expression can sometimes subconsciously make me hold back on telling him how I feel about him. Not always though. I am pretty sure his love language is quality time and mine is lowkey most of them\ud83d\ude05 I am aware that everyone gives and shows love differently and I love how he does it in his own way and would never want to change that, but I don\u2019t think that I am asking too much for a little more vocalization here and there\u2026 am I?? His guy friends literally compliment my appearance (non flirtatiously) more than he does when we go out together. Most of the verbal reassurance I get regarding how he feels about me is also from his friends saying that he talks about me all the time and that they\u2019ve never seen him happier with anyone else etc. I actually think compliments that\u2019re almost \u201cbehind my back\u201d like that are more valuable because they feel more genuine, but it\u2019s frustrating that I get to hear all these nice things from everyone but the person I care the most to hear them from. \n\nLuckily, I consider myself a very confident and secure person that does not rely on external validation to determine how I feel about myself, nor do I NEED constant reassurance of how people feel towards me\u2026 but I still really love to hear it. \nThis has been something I\u2019ve noticed for a while but I decided not to address it because I know that is just the way he is and I don\u2019t take it personally. However, we are starting long distance soon and I am worried that I will crave verbal reassurance a lot more and therefore need to address this. I feel like receiving verbal affection sticks and is one of the longer lasting forms of affection to hold onto and that is something I think will be especially valuable when doing long distance. \n\nWe have a very jokey relationship and he is very non confrontational so I thought about bringing it up in a joking manner but I don\u2019t want him to miss the point and dismiss it. Thoughts? I definitely don\u2019t want the conversation to be too heavy because it\u2019s not a real issue in the relationship, rather a preference. I also don\u2019t want to come off secure or needy, but I am trying to normalize expressing my wants and needs in all relationships and I think everyone else should do the same. I want to point out that his friends compliment me more than he does (this wouldn\u2019t cause any jealousy, he knows it\u2019s just friendly) because I think he\u2019s genuinely oblivious and that could be a good wake up call for him but I don\u2019t want him to think that I am comparing him or trying to change him. I think that mentioning how this relates to concerns for our future long distance relationship could be helpful too but I don\u2019t want to make this \u201cissue\u201d sound more problematic than it is. \n\nHow do I get my boyfriend to show more verbal affection toward me?",

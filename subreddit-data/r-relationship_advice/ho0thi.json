    "postText": "My fianc\u00e9 and I got engaged in December last year. In January this year, we both together decided to save money every month for our wedding and honeymoon. In 6 months, we saved around $8000. Last month, my fianc\u00e9's bestfriend bought a new gaming pc, so even my fianc\u00e9 wanted to buy one, so he asked me, but I denied it because we both already had laptops. I told him that he can play games in the laptop that he already has. He repeatedly kept asking me if he could buy a pc and I finally agreed to it (now I regret it so badly).\n\n After a week, the pc finally came and with the pc, a new table and chair also was delivered. Apparently he had ordered a gaming chair and a table as well. That night, I asked him how much it all cost and he was a little hesitant to tell me. After a while he told me and I was distraught when I heard that he had spent our entire savings of $8000 to buy the pc. We had a very big argument that night and I scolded him for spending all our savings because that savings contained not only his money but my money as well. And we were saving it for our wedding. After everything I told him, his final reply was \"I will earn it all back soon\". I don't trust those words at all. \n\n I thought anything worse than this couldn't happen at this moment, but it has. It has been about 2 weeks since he got the pc and since then, my finac\u00e9 hasn't gotten up from his new chair. Ever since he got the pc, he hasn't even seen my face. The only time he talks to me is when he is hungry, he calls to me and tells me to get him something to eat/drink. I call him to watch TV and he denies it saying that he's busy. I call him to sleep together and he denies it and says that he'll sleep later. His sleep schedule has been fucked. He plays games the whole night and sleeps as 5am and wakes up at 2pm. He's asleep when I'm awake and he's awake when I'm asleep. From the past 2 weeks I've been so lonely that it feels like I'm alone at home and nobody to even talk to. He is ignoring me so much that I think he has absolutely forgotten that I even exist in his life. I honestly feel like his waitress now a days because from the past 2 weeks, the only interaction we both have is him asking for food and water and me giving it to him.\n\nHe has also 100% stopped doing all the house chores. From the past 2 weeks, I have been the one doing all the house chores and it's getting very hard for me to do it all alone. We used to share our responsibilities and do all the house chores together, but from the past 2 weeks, he isn't even taking care of himself. He is barely even brushing his teeth and taking a bath, let alone do the house chores. Also he is actually supposed to be working from home, but ever since the pc arrived, he hasn't even touched his laptop to work and he's isn't even seeing his phone to check if someone has called/text him anything regarding work. I'm now genuinely afraid that he might lose his job.\n\nEverything that is happening right now is so bad, I called my parents and told them about it last night and they almost had nothing to say. I'm thinking of calling his parents tonight and telling it to them, and maybe they can knock some sense into him. I honestly don't know what else to do now. I want to burn that pc. It would be very nice if someone suggested me something about this. Thank you very much for reading this and thank you very much in advance for your comments and suggestions.\n\nTl;dr : My finac\u00e9 spent all the money that we were saving for our wedding to buy a gaming pc and now all he does the whole day is play video games. He has totally ignored me and he has forgotten that I even exist in the house. He has also stopped doing all the house chores and has also totally ignored his work that he was supposed to do from home.",

You can't just not check your laptop/work phone for 2 weeks and still keep your job. After a couple of days of missing work without giving a reason, they either try to get in touch with you through other means or fire you directly. \n\nI agree with the other people that commented - 8000$ for a gaming PC is too much. You really should get to the bottom of this and go from there. But I don't see how is this salvageable. He clearly doesn't respect you and seems that he doesn't really care about you.

[Here is what I came up with](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/hhhdRk). That still leaves $3,000 for a desk and chair. Let\u2019s take out $1,250 for a state of the art office chair and that STILL leaves $1,750 for a desk. Unless he got himself a cocobolo desk, I have no idea how he blew through all of that.\n\nEdit: with taxes the computer would be $5,554 with a 7% tax. Which would leave roughly $1200 for a desk after a chair costing $1,250.\n\nEdit #2: Yes I\u2019m aware a pc can cost so much more than what I put down, but I said within reason. Buying 2 2080 TIs is not within reason imo. Also she said he already played games on his laptop so I assumed he had most of his library already there, no need to blow $1000 on the Steam Summer Sale",

This is about as likely as him becoming an NBA star.\n\nOr maybe he's immature and acting out over some perceived slight and feels entitled to blow the cash and ignore you until you break down and apologize. \n\nEither way your relationship has become toxic and may already be dead.  If you decide to stay you need to ask if you're ready to deal with a repeat incident years down the road, or with a child in the picture if that's your long term plan.",

Sell it because your BF totally wastes all the money you both contributed, and further, he\u2019s clearly showing behavioural signs of addiction. \n\nI had to give my now hubby YEARS ago an ultimatum, we had a toddler, he literally would play on his PC 15 hours a day, sleep a couple hours, and in between work his p/t job. After our son just turned a year I walked up to him because he consistently ignored me/us if we went to him at the PC (a gaming one he built so expensive, but not as much). He ignored me so I unplugged the power. He was about to yell at me because he was in the middle of a \u2018raid\u2019. I didn\u2019t care. I just told him, \u201cyou have a choice. Make sure you are confident in your answer because I\u2019m not going to repeat myself. It\u2019s either your gaming and playing your stuff, or us.\u201d (I had packed bags ready to leave). I didn\u2019t even have to hide it because I did it while he had played it for hours at this point. I was basically a single mother because I was the only one that took a care of the person we created. \n\nAddiction is a very difficult thing to overcome and to continually support because it\u2019s a disease. We are still together today, but I\u2019d be lying if it hasn\u2019t worn me down to the point of despair sometimes. I\u2019ve even written gaming reform studies and submissions to EU parliamentary studies that are now beginning to regulate developers for unethical practices related to addictions and problem gambling. There are laws being drafted to combat these unethical practices that\u2019s begun in Ireland. UK, and even the UN, and it\u2019s coming to AU as well. \n\nI think you need to sit him down if course and tell him how his sudden behaviour is unacceptable and he needs to make a choice. I think you need to put your foot down and tell him the computer must be sold. You both split the money and move on, or break up, split money after sale and go your separate ways.",

If they own a place, time to talk to a lawyer. \n\nSince it seems like the money was in a joint account, I doubt she can get any money back. If she has any more money in a joint account(s) with him time to quietly take her half and open a new bank account with her money to protect it. \n\nNot being married she has little legal recourse for this money. It's crappy but a good lesson for her and anyone out there to never combine finances without a marriage licenses or legal contracts with a lawyer that legally protects you in a similar way to marriage.\n\nIn the meantime, stop getting him food and use that time to formulate how to get out of this relationship.\n\nAlso, don't call his parents. He isn't a child and neither is she. Their relationship problems are up to them to figure out. In this case it's up to her to figure out what she wants to do. Because he has made it abundantly clear where his priorities are and abusing her trust, taking their money, and having her as his Mom (not maid, maids at least get paid money) seem to be his.",

There was no need for that expensive of one. \n\nI don't personally think it's worth him trying to \"win her back\", that would take so much time rebuilding trust.

And left a note on the table along with the ring explaining how you've been feeling and why you're leaving. Maybe that would be the reality check he needs.

Stop being a doormat. Just stop. \n\n*Pick your dignity up off the floor and start using it again. This person doesn't love you. He loved your half of the $8K. You need to understand and acknowledge to yourself that this person doesn't care about you, so you can move on from this.\n\n*It's shocking that your parents didn't have much to say...but, perhaps they have always seen this side of him and aren't actually surprised by this behavior.\n\n*Don't bother telling his parents. What would that achieve? A lot of your statements seem to indicate you want to find ways to stay with this a-hole. WHY?! So he can treat you like shit at some point later in life?\n\n*Close any shared bank accounts or other accounts you have with this a-hole, and keep any money in them. \n\n*Change the account passwords on anything in your name.\n\n*Get your personal documents and belongings together and take them to your parents house in prep for leaving. \n\n*Speak to your landlord, if you are on the lease, and explain the situation. \n\n*Once everything is completely separate, just leave him a note, taped above the toilet, telling him it's over and you're gone. It's a place he actually has to leave the game to use and is fully representative of where your relationship has ended up.\n\nStop being a doormat. Good luck.",

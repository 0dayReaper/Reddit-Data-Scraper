    "postText": "my partner and i have been together for 6mos. the past relationship he was in was 7 years and my last relationship lasted 8 years. how do i get over his past? his family and friends are still friends w his ex and hang out. he broke up with her right before he met me and sometimes i feel bad about the timing. i know long term relationships can be hard to get over and move on from entirely especially if finances, familial relationships, and friends are shared. in my situation w my ex, i have zero ties to him anymore. am i allowed to feel weird about it or should i just accept it and let it go? he claims he\u2019s entirely over his ex and would never get back w her but i get scared of how enmeshed they were and if i\u2019m just an in-between connection. we are in a serious relationship talking about a future together but i still feel insecure about his past.",

If you answered no to these questions, I\u2019d say there\u2019s maybe not much to worry about. Sometimes people break up and remain amicable, and often times they\u2019ve already moved past the relationship way before it ended.\n\nIf you answered yes to any of those questions then I\u2019d have a talk with him, let him know how you\u2019re feeling and communicate through your worries.",

    "postText": "Typing this out in Mobile. Apologies for grammar or formatting \n\nA little back story before I get to the meat. My wife and I met when I was 20. We had a drunk hookup the first night we met. We continued seeing each other after that night. A few weeks later she found out she was pregnant. We stayed together and I proposed a few months later. I had doubts about her pregnancy lining up with our timeline but I never brought it up or discussed it. Not to mention I was in the military and deployed a few months later. My proposal weighed a lot on her carrying my child. I grew up in a home without a dad and never wanted that. \n\n\nFast forward 12 years we are still married. Though it has been extremely volatile and rocky I\u2019ve stayed together honestly because I could never part from my son. I can\u2019t let him grow up with an absent father. So I\u2019ve made it work. Our marriage is dead outside of our child. \n\n\nI ran into an old friend who I knew around the time I met my wife. He asked if I was still with her and I said yes. He mentioned how \u201cit was crazy I dated her and then you stole her from me!\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure what he meant and asked him to elaborate. He said \u201cit\u2019s no big deal but I was seeing her up until that weekend you met her.\u201d I dropped it but inside my doubt and insecurities ran wild. I couldn\u2019t get it out of head. I broke down and bought a home DNA test kit and used it on my son and I without telling my wife. \n\n\nThe results came back today. He is not my son. 0% chance I am his biological son. I\u2019m destroyed. My whole world is upside down. I\u2019m just on autopilot at the moment. I don\u2019t know how to act or feel. I\u2019m just a zombie right now. \n\n\nOne thing I know is no matter what he is my son. I\u2019ve been by his side the moment he was born and will absolutely never abandon him. Absolutely nothing will change that. \n\nWhat I haven\u2019t decided is how if at all I bring it up to my wife. I feel like my whole marriage was a lie. I can\u2019t help but wonder if she knew. How do I confront her. Regardless that I\u2019m not in love with her I still love her. This will crush her. This will absolutely devastate her. I don\u2019t know what to do. I plan on seeing a counselor/therapist ASAP. So many emotions and thoughts flooding my mind. Just need some help to bring me back down.\n\nEDIT: I appreciate all the support and words of advice. Both good, bad and the assholes. I\u2019m going to sit on this until I get my head right.",

I\u2019m sorry this has happened. \n\nMy parents (biological parents) got married because they found out they were pregnant with me. When I was about 1, they decided to end it. I\u2019ve talked with my mom a lot about why this happened and what her thought process was and she always says something along the lines of: \u201cI knew that I\u2019d so much rather raise you in *two* happy households instead of *one* unhappy one.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what happened. I grew up with two separate, happy marriages as examples. I got to be loved by so many more people. I have good relationships with all my parents. I have no resentment. \n\nI just wanted to say that good outcomes of divorce exist. Sometimes it really is what is best for the family unit as a whole. Divorce doesn\u2019t always end badly. Sometimes it\u2019s the most calm &amp; clear path for everyone involved. \n\nGood luck, I\u2019m rooting for you.",

Not saying it will ruin the kid but there are a lot more things that need to be considered and handled. \n\nThis is also different because the \"father\" isn't the father but is the father. It is a really hard situation for him to be in. You get angry at the situation and then feel guilty that you are angry about your kid, but they aren't your kid...but they are and you hate yourself for questioning it. You look at your kid differently. Not all the time but you catch yourself in moments, \"not my kid\" bubbles from the  subconscious. Are you allowed to think that? Is it fair for you to think that? Are you still a good person for thinking that. You look at the last decade of your life and think about how it would be different if it wasn't built on a lie. At the same time that is a decade of effort poured into raising your child that you love. But they aren't your child...but they are. The lie has become the truth and there are parts that cannot be untangled for better or for worse. It is near impossible to properly feel sad or angry without feeling guilty or letting self hate creep in. It takes a resoundingly strong and good person to do what needs to be done here.\n\nI have gone through something similar. Therapist up. No matter the the direction this plays out you need it and the 12 year old who will look to you as a father for the rest of their life needs you to.",

I am 20 now so I obviously am not in the case of I split up but my parents did when I was 9 and some of my friends actually have split parents too. \n\nIn the start my mom always talked bad about my dad and it really hurt our realtionship for some time(mine and my mothers). I mean of course it was a split and some shit happend that was far from OK but my dad drove 250km every second weekend to pick up me and my brother, then drove back so we could stay at his place. Then bring us back on sunday. So he drove 1000km for this every 2 weeks. That is actually insane. So he was always there and I valued that. My mother had a hard time with the split tho and she was very emotional about it. I could have dodged the army service in my country if she would have not been to mad at him(Because they are from different countries and with \"his\" citizenship I would not have to got). This are things that really make me mad because I asked her more than once but she always made a move out of emotions she has towards my father. I have to go to the millitary in 2 months now and at the moment I could not be more pissed. So really dont talk bad about them and act for your kid not out of hate or whatever. We may be easy to manipulate at 12 or earlier but we grow up and it will backfire. And dont lie. Be honest with your kids.",

Even if your ex is an asshole, take the high road. Kids are smart - they will figure out what's what as they get older and smarter.\n\nGood luck, mama, you've got this.",

It\u2019s worth keeping in mind that our laws around parenthood were for the most part developed before DNA evidence was an option - common law systems are inherently slow to change. Up until about 25 years ago publicly acknowledging a child and acting as its parent was the only way to legally establish fatherhood, and enforcing that acknowledgement was the only way to stop deadbeats from abandoning their children, so that\u2019s how our laws are written. \n\nAlso, Jesus, the kid is 12. OP is his dad. How horrible would it be for both of them if a judge let a complete stranger walk in and tear their family apart because he\u2019s technically a genetic relative?",

Very similar beginning to you, drunk hookup, ended getting together when my mom got pregnant (except I\u2019m definitely my father\u2019s child). \n\nIt did me absolutely no favors. Even when my parents weren\u2019t fighting in front of me, kids are perceptive and pick up on your emotions. My home life varied from volatile, to tense, to a few rare moments when we were actually happy together- but even those were tainted by the fear of what was gonna happen to make them mad at each other again. They both loved me, no doubt, they weren\u2019t mean to me really, but I still feel like my life would be so much better if they just ended it. There were a few times they did separate for like a week or two and those were the calmest, most peaceful moments. I love my dad but I was always crushed when he came back. \n\nPlus, you owe it to yourself to model the life you\u2019d want your child to have. Would you want your son to grow up to be in this situation? Or would you rather he go on to find *real* love? You say you don\u2019t want to be an absent father, but plenty of fathers are amazing dads in split households.  \n\n\nWhatever you decide to do, I\u2019d consult a lawyer whether you intend to leave your wife or not. There\u2019s a good chance she at least suspects you\u2019re not the real father. If things go sour, she may try to use this against you for full custody. You say you intend to still be his father, so you want to make sure that whatever happens, you\u2019re still there for him.",

It was the best thing they did and the kindest to all of us. They are both still so happy and have always cared about eachother, remained a team in raising us and amicable. They both attended my sister's graduation, went out for a meal together to celebrate afterwards, attended every parents evening as a united front. My sister and I are both in our 20s and they still remain friendly and we had a fine childhood.",

You actively hurt your kid so much more by staying in a loveless relationship \u201cfor the kid\u201d than by divorcing her and maintaining a relationship with him.\n\nAll you\u2019ve done is show your kid very poor examples of love. That\u2019s something that takes a lifetime to overcome, if you ever can. My brother and I are products of that rationale and it\u2019s created so much internal strife and doubt where the concepts of genuine affection and loyalty are. We look back at our childhood and no small part of us thinks about how we ruined our parents\u2019 lives because they bought the lie that a miserable nuclear unit is better than a happy split family. \n\nParents still ended up getting divorced just much later and when we were adults and it was a total shitshow.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine how heavy this knowledge has been for you, but try and frame it in your head that you\u2019d want/should to end this relationship even if the test results came back as him being 100% yours. \n\nAlso, with DNA tests being commercially viable you and your wife need to have this conversation right now before your son has a hideous shock later because he just wanted to take the same test as his friends are taking. Don\u2019t do that to him. Don\u2019t do that to you.\n\nEveryone in this story has a chance to be happy, just not in the situation it\u2019s always been. Call a family law attorney.",

He didn't know any better than you did, you both grew up knowing each other as father and son, and DNA only changes that biologically. It doesn't change all the time you spent together, all the time you spent raising him, all the time he spent knowing you as his father and you are still that person and so is he. Family is so much more than blood and I'm glad you're on board with that. \n\nBut wow yeah, how to deal with your wife... It's okay to still love somebody but not be *in love* with them, and obviously this was becoming the case long before you found out that your son is not *biologically* yours. \n\nSo one of the things to me, is that kids tend to learn a lot from their parents relationships. And a loveless relationship is only teaching them that they should do the same. Definitely see a therapist to help you navigate this, but also see a lawyer. Even if you don't have any plans right now, talk to a lawyer and see what your options are. Because despite not being the *biological* father, presumably you're still on his birth certificate and you've been his father for a dozen years. So at least talk to a lawyer and figure out what you can expect if you do decide to leave her.",

They split up and my mother got pregnant with me by my biological father who happens to be my sisters father as well. My Dad took me knowing he wasn\u2019t me father and raised me like he was. I had a much better childhood than my biological Siblings. \n\nFor some reason five years ago they told me all of this but he is my Dad. I did however spend my whole life thinking I had a half brother and sister on my Moms side. And two more on my Dads. I met my Mom once when I was 16 and my sister. Never saw either one again until I was 21. Turns out my sister has the same father as well and she was molested by him so I will never be told his name or meet him but it\u2019s cool to know I have a full blooded sister. After all these years she is my closest sibling anyway. \n\nBut short story long man it\u2019s a tough situation and you\u2019re the kids Dad regardless if the father. I was pretty upset when I found out at 30 years old. So I recommend either don\u2019t tell the kid at all or do it now. Because as he gets older it\u2019s harder to take in. Every argument or teen wrong doing will weigh heavier later when he feels like damn everything he put up with and I\u2019m not even his. There could be a lot of guilt. Was for me.",

My mom did the same except she\u2019d also break down and cry after arguments then blame me, saying she has to stay because of me. I remember being around 6 the first time, scared because my dad left after a fight, and sad to see my mom sitting on the floor sobbing in the dark. I would sit next to her and cry just because she was crying and it hurt me to see her cry. She\u2019d then tell me it\u2019s because of me she has to hurt like this - it was my fault that she can\u2019t leave. The year I turned 12, on her birthday, I told her I couldn\u2019t buy her anything but made her a card and told her that she had my blessing to leave if she wanted. She turned right around and told me I was rude for that and ungrateful to my father when all the previous years she blamed me to my face as the reason she had to stay in such a terrible relationship. They\u2019re still together and doing better now that I\u2019m 27, but I will never forget all the nights I spent hiding under my bed, crying in the dark, listening to my parents throw shit in the living room at 2am, and praying to God that they wouldn\u2019t hurt or kill each other. Such a shitty, shitty childhood. It really warped my view of relationships and I wonder if it\u2019s the reason why I hold on to toxic relationships.",

It's weird though as most people say that the children of such parents will end up doing the same. But I learned how not to be and I hate fighting and I'm very reasonable and supportive as long as the other person communicates and tries to solve any issue in a calm and loving matter. As I'm typing this I remember I did hold on to toxic relationships in the past, but not anymore. Cheers to us and anyone who survived such a childhood with the smallest amount of damage possible. Much love, take care!",

It was always tense in the house, and it got to the point that it went beyond not being able to work it out, it had soured to a really vindictive attitude towards the other person. Couple that with witnessing the domestic abuse that happened like clockwork, I developed pretty bad anxiety and stayed out of home as often as I could. When they finally divorced and separated, my relationship with both improved so much and it was like a burden which I never realised was as heavy as it was finally lifted. I hold nothing against them, because I knew they were trying to do the right thing, but I only wish they had walked away from each other sooner if it wasn\u2019t something they could work on and genuinely move past their differences... \n\nSorry that you have to be going through something so terrible though.

            "comment": "My first thoughts while reading this (before I even got to the part with the results of the DNA test) were that you should consider splitting up with your wife. From what it sounds like, you\u2019re not exactly happy with her. Life is too short. I think that the results of the DNA test are irrelevant. You know in your heart that you will always be your son\u2019s father, even if you don\u2019t share DNA. If you decide to get a divorce, you can find someone who really makes you genuinely happy, and your son will be happy for you and will understand when he gets older. Kids feed off of your happiness. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t even bring up the results of the test to either one of them. Maybe that\u2019s your mental \u201cout\u201d for gathering the courage to start over. Maybe that\u2019s a chat you can have with your son in a few years, but I wouldn\u2019t even worry yourself with the stress of discussing it. I also agree with u/jillbowaggins in that you should definitely seek legal advice before you do anything, just in case there\u2019s a chance of you jeopardizing the custody of your son. \n\nYou will get through this, life has a funny way of sorting itself out. Good luck and thank you for your service!!",

However, there\u2019s a lot of talk on reddit about how the courts are biased in favor of mothers and I think that\u2019s not entirely true.\n\nPew found that in over half of divorce cases, both parents agreed that the mother should have primary custody. Family courts only rule on custody in 9% of cases (source: https://erlichlegal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Erlich_Child-custody-statistics.jpg)\n\nMore discussion in this article: https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dispelling-the-myth-of-ge_b_1617115\n\nIn short, mothers do get primary custody much more often than fathers, but this is largely due to the fact that fathers seldom fight for custody in court. And, legally, you are your son\u2019s father. You\u2019re on the hook for any child support your son may require, but conversely you have as valid a claim to custody as any other parent.\n\nFinally, your son is old enough that his preferences would be taken into account when awarding custody. \n\nDefinitely talk to a lawyer, but I don\u2019t want you to get the mistaken impression that your only options are staying in a miserable marriage or losing your son.\n\nBest of luck OP, I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re in such a shit situation.",

He's still your son who you love and who you raised and who you are not gonna walk out on.  Your wife is still your wife who youve built a relationship with, imperfect as it is.  She may have not known.  At the very least she hoped you were the father and wanted you to be the boy's father.  \n\nThat being said I think staying in a relationship where you're unhappy just for the sake of the child is not healthy.

The timeline of when she was conceived kind of left room for me to have doubts but the time when my wife cheated wasn\u2019t the time my daughter would have been conceived.\n\nHe gave me good advice at the time, \u201cif you take the test and find out she\u2019s not yours, is it going to change what you do?\u201d I loved my daughter deeply, and I still do, even more so and that wasn\u2019t going to change. So I never took the test, and if I did one today and found out she\u2019s not mine, it wouldn\u2019t change how much I love her and I wouldn\u2019t leave because of all the work I put into fixing my marriage and the results I got from it.

The more often I confront it the easier it is to not be afraid of it when those ideas get in my head. So this comment here is kind of therapeutic for me.",

You can absolutely still be there for your son without being with his mother. \n\nAgain, I think some one with knowledge is this field, emotionally mentally and legally, may be your best option here. As pointed out in other comments, your marriage either ends now or when your son turns 18 at this point, and it\u2019s up to you to decide what is best for you and your kid. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry his happened to you, and I hope it truly was an accident. You sound like a very dedicated father and I want you to know that it makes all the difference in a kid to have someone who shows they obviously care about them no matter what. \n\nGood luck \ud83c\udf40",

You don\u2019t state the test you took but maybe the cheek scrape one would be the best one to do.\nHair/ toothbrush I think are the next other decent tests( going off memory what a friend did).\n\nYou\u2019re going to have to tell your wife.\nIf she has kept this from you for all these years then only you can decide if you can stay in the marriage. If she didn\u2019t know and the two of you had a sexual relationship at the same time with her then she might in all honesty not know - unless your child looks nothing like you and looks like the other guy and her. Then I would say she knew and hoped you wouldnt question it.\n\nYou can\u2019t undo what\u2019s been done and neither can she.\nBefore you say anything, do another test. Depending on the results, see a lawyer. Line up the best advice you can to go through the next phase.\nOnce you\u2019ve spoken to the lawyer and you have a plan, get the kid to family for the weekend so you can tell your wife.\nYou\u2019re going into this prepared and she will be blindsided. She will probably express anger at this alone then that you betrayed her doing the DNA test.\n\nIt really doesn\u2019t matter what she says. You have to keep calm. Do not shout at much as you\u2019d want to. You really need to be calm for you.\nJust do one thing at a time. Trying to do it all and stay stable will be impossible running high on rage and hurt and utter disbelief. \nHang in there the best you can. You\u2019ll get through this as hard as it will be.",

            "comment": "Okay so note; Reddit loves to tell people to throw in the towel on this sub. They only hear about the problem. Not the 12 years of ups and downs. They don\u2019t see the relationship in whole. I\u2019ll do what we do at my job and help you better see the pros and cons to help you make an informed decision. The decision is yours to make, but let me help you make sure you see all the angles. \n\nFirst and foremost, tell her. It\u2019s the right thing to do.  Across the board. Give her a chance to come clean if she did know but go in with an open mind. Don\u2019t go in assuming the worst. That\u2019s not fair. You don\u2019t have to of course but across the board, it\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\nYou said your decision to marry her weighed in on her carrying your child. Is that the reason you stayed? Have you wished you were single that entire time? If yes, which is totally okay, then you need to leave her. Even if you two decide to withhold the truth from your son until he\u2019s old enough to handle it, don\u2019t stay with someone because of a kid. You\u2019re letting tradition overcome actual happiness. What is this, 1890? Separate and let your son see what a house hold full of love really looks like. Do it for both of you.\n\nWas your household full of love? Are you letting your anger and hurt at this shitty situation cloud the good things? I\u2019m just trying to keep you from making a rash decision.  Divorce sucks and marriages take work. Families take work and they take sacrifices. It\u2019s up to you and you alone to decide what you\u2019re willing to sacrifice for what you have and fuck anyone who wants to judge you for it. Rather you decide to stay or leave, it\u2019s your life and your choice because it\u2019s your happiness.\n\nFinal bit of advice, sleep on it. The only medicine for these types of painful, fucked up situations in life is time. If you find that you can\u2019t stand to be with her after this, leave. If you find yourself missing her, try to move on. Just avoid your pride keeping you from happiness. It\u2019s your life and your decision. Listen to your heart.",

She\u2019ll be upset at first but soon feel relieved that the painful secret is out. \n\nYou did an honorable thing but I say misguided. You do not need to live with a woman to be a good father. You carve out time and money and dedicate that to your son. That\u2019s being a parent. Living in a loveless marriage and leaving that as a role model for you kids is poor parenting and being a martyr due to the psychological damage done to you as a child. \n\nRise above what was done to you. Seek out a loving relationship. Take care of your children...including kids you now decide you want to include in your life even tho not biologically yours.",

I don't know what kind of woman your wife is (or was 13 years ago), but this reciently happened to a friend of mine and she never intended to deceive her husband. She knew it was a possibility (a very slight one, in her mind)  because she slept with someone else before they met but she truly believed the timing was off and felt sure that her husband was the father. She loves him, loves their child and loves the life they have. \n\nAs I said, I don't know your family, but it is possible that your wife really didn't know, or genionly didnt know but desperately wanted you to be the father and didn't know how to drop a bombshell that could potentially destroy your whole family. It's a scary thing.\n\n I sympathize with you 110%, I just wanted to suggest the possibility some less malicious motives on your wives end.  You won't know until you speak with her, but don't jump straight to \"she knew, she's lying, she used you and has lied for 12 years\" because that is the worst case scenario, but definitely not the only plausible one.",

It doesn't sound like she cheated on you, or lied to you, or hid things from you. And both of you absolutely had the option of getting a paternity test after your son was born and before you two married, and you didn't. I understand you had your reasons why, but what that tells me is you made a choice to willfully ignore the possibility that your son was not yours because it would've made things more complicated at the time. It was a valid choice, but you need to take responsibility for it.\n\nIf you want to end the relationship now because its not working, then do that. But don't let yourself decide you're ending it because of some unilateral betrayal on her part. That's just not fair to her. If you're struggling with this, get some therapy.",

    "postText": "My wife and I have kept our finances separate since we got married almost 4 years ago. She has had around $20,000 of debt since I\u2019ve known her. I took over most of the finances early on so she could focus on paying down her debt in the hopes eventually she would get a better job and could help out with all our expenses. Well it\u2019s coming up on a year she has a really good paying job, but she has more debt than ever. I\u2019m convinced I\u2019ve placated her spending habits over the years and she really upped her shopping. She gets angry when I ask for details on her finances so I really don\u2019t know where the money she makes goes. \nWe kept pushing a European trip for years because of lack of money, but it started to feel like now or never. Given my wife\u2019s finances it was sorta expected I pay more for the trip to make it happen. By the end of the trip we both spent more than we probably should have. My intention and hope was that once back home we could both take a break from big expenses and finally focus on clearing up all our debt once and for all since we both are fortunate to have good jobs. \n\nWhile away, my dad house sat for us cause we have a dog and he accidentally spilled pen ink on our 2 year old couch. My wife keeps a very clean almost pristine house and the couch was one of her favorite pieces of furniture we have. After failing to get the ink out with rubbing alcohol and trying an upholstery cleaner service with no luck to get it removed completely my wife took things into her own hands and called to see if we could get a replacement cushion from the manufacturer. So I was sitting in my office and she comes in and says we didn\u2019t have warranty on the couch and she recommends to rebuy the same couch for $1400. I said I can\u2019t afford that after our expensive trip plus all my normal monthly expenses. Instead of understanding where I was coming from she suggests that she pay for it through monthly installments. I\u2019ll admit I lost it a little and did not approach the situation calmly. The ink stain is unfortunate, but I was able to get the majority of it out and it looks fine. I stormed after her and wanted her to admit to me that it was not a good idea to rebuy the same couch cause of a small stain only she alone found glaring. I couldn\u2019t let it go and kept pestering her to admit that she\u2019s not understanding why spending $1400 on a new couch was so incredibly wasteful given now both of us had debt to contend with. She starting asking me to leave as she had to go back to work, but I wanted her to admit to some wrong doing or understand the financial stress I was under. We both started screaming with her mostly asking me to leave. I kept refusing and she eventually broke and struck me and grabbed my neck. When I pushed her off she took her keyboard and slammed it on the ground and then knocked her printer and some other stuff to the ground. Now I\u2019m aware that I have a hard time giving her space when she\u2019s angry as it has happened before, but I\u2019m always surprised how fast she can get physically violent. I say something along the lines of I\u2019ll leave when you calm down, don\u2019t break anything, or hit me. She does for a moment and I do leave. \nWhen she has reached this point in the past I eventually apologize cause she tells me I deserve to be hit because I don\u2019t let up and give her space like she asks. She doesn\u2019t apologize and will typically say something along the lines of I\u2019m sorry you made me reach that point. I\u2019m just so tired of someone hitting me and for the first time putting her hands around my throat. It makes me feel weaker and more powerless after each incident. I feel no gratefulness for all the financial security I\u2019ve given her over the years. Divorce is brought up during the fight and I finally feel that it\u2019s time. Or at least it feels more of the right decision than it ever has in the past. We\u2019ve made it almost 4 years married and our fights are just escalating worse and worse. We fortunately don\u2019t have any kids, but I\u2019m still worried about the other loses that come with divorce. And when I sit alone with my thoughts my anger can sway and instead I fear loneliness and losing the first real person that has ever made me feel loved. I\u2019m a insecure person sometimes so often my wife has a way of convincing me I was primarily at fault for starting the fight and argues many would agree with her. Essentially, If I did not start being upset, and I just left when asked in the first place she would have never reacted the way she did. Am I wrong for getting angry over her suggestion to buy a whole new couch over a small stain after we just came back from a super expensive trip? Of course I could have been more calm, but it felt so ridiculous given our financial situation. Just how at fault am I in this whole ordeal from an outsiders perspective? How should I proceed? I\u2019m just not talking to her at all right now. I\u2019m curious from other women if there SO refused to leave without getting the answer they wanted if they would resort to hitting and breaking things. And if not, what would they do instead? I\u2019m sadly still conflicted about divorce. It feels so permanent. Our relationship is amazing in so many other ways, but these fights are just so ugly and taken so far it\u2019s impossible to ignore them. I tell her we both can do better, but I get the sense it really only me that needs to learn a lesson. \n\nTL;DR Wife and I got into an ugly fight after she suggest we rebuy our same couch for $1400 because of a small ink stain on one of the cushions.",

The couch is only the culmination and representation of several other things going on, personal and as a couple that both of you are not dealing with but keep inside ready to explode.\n\nIf you two are not ready to face and fix all that, even with couple's therapy if needed, then it will be better to separate.\n\nAgain, because I do not see love in all this, you two can disagree but it can still come from love... This is not it.\n\nAnd both of you are wrong in your behavior.",

There is no excuse for that.\nHer argument \"I hit you because you did not give me space\" is BS because there are dozens of other ways to react to that (e.g. she could leave herself, she could lock a door, etc.)\n\n\n2) She is manipulating into thinking you deserve to be assaulted and that you need to apologize to her.\nThis is textbook gaslighting and one of many flavours of mental abuse.\n\n\n3) She is taking advantage of you finacially.\nYou took over everything and instead of taking care of paying down her debts she raised her spendings for herself. She feels entitled to living over her means and now seem to be entitled to you financing her.\n\n\nPoint number 1) alone is enought to put an end to this and like I stated, there are more points after that.\nAlso you never even once wrote anything positive about your wife.\nSo why do you keep doing this to yourself?\nI mean I hate it when someone goes to \"you need to leave immitiatly\" over the smallest problems, but this is a textbook case of you catering to a serial abuser that seems to ruin your finances and mental health.",

    "postText": "\n\nHi, I (23F) have been with my partner (27M) for 3 years. Engaged for just under a year. \n\nWe have had 4 miscarriages in the last year, and are in the process of buying a house together. \n\nWe were sat together and he scrolled down his notifications and I saw an email from Snapchat saying so sorry your leaving us, you have 30 days before your account is permanently deleted addressed to a different name - James. His name isn't James. \n\nI didn't say anything, I thought it may just be spam. But curiosity got the better of me. Later that evening I asked could I use his phone and he said no problem, I went and looked at the email and there was a chain of different emails saying welcome back, sorry your leaving, welcome back, sorry your leaving, numerous times. I managed to log into the account eventually to see what was going on. \n\nHe was subscribed to many girls Snapchat premiums, advertising only fans. All of his friends on it were girls. \n\nI asked him what it was and he just said to leave it. He didn't want an argument. I kept pushing. He broke, and told me he's been using it to get videos and he's been sending stuff himself. He then later told me he was using it to talk to girls aswell, which I think in a way is worse. We don't really have an intimate relationship anymore. It broke down a few months ago, I ask him to have sex, or buy and wear sexy lingerie but he says he's too tired. \n\nThe details on the account say it was opened within the last 2 months, he's sent 6,334 snaps and received 4,786 snaps. \n\nI don't know what to do. I've been cheated on before, my first partner of 3 years got my ex bestfriend pregnant when cheating on me. My second partner had a porn addiction and chose porn over me, now this. I love him so so much, I don't think I can do life without him. But I don't know if I can trust him again. He said he has done this before and this wasn't his first account, he feels guilty and deletes them but makes new ones. \n\nI think this is worse than him cheating in person. He's actively looking to be unfaithful with multiple girls. \n\nWould anyone forgive him and try and forget or is this the end of the road? Thanks",

Make lots of memories, money and meet interesting people along the way... Freeze your eggs if you want children in future. Imperfect man will come along to make your life beautiful.

He\u2019s NOT going to change. \n\nIn 10 years, do you want to be legally entangled with someone, possibly with children, who is still cheating? Who is emotionally negligent or even abusive? \n\nYou can definitely \u201cdo life\u201d without him. Don\u2019t make the mistake of staying with this guy. He has sent over 6,000 snaps.

But even though you guys have been through so much and you love him so much, there's also this underlying issue of him lying to you and him speaking to, flirting too, sexting sending videos and receiving videos sexually with how many other women? That's a flat out lie of a foundation that he's building with you. I'm sorry to be blunt. But if you do decide to stay with him, prepare yourself and protect yourself. The best way to protect your heart would be to leave.\n\nI'm literally in the midst of breaking up with the love of my life that I want to marry because I found out that he watches porn every single day. He stopped wanting to have sex with me and always said he was tired, it made me feel like garbage and lowered my self esteem to the point that I stopped even trying to be intimate with him. Which is so sad because I love connecting in that way and I wanted to deepen our connection together in that way. But it turns out he's been getting his on the side. I stayed with him for a few months after I found this out but recently it's all resurfaced and I can't do this again. I'm so broken. All I can think about is the beautiful future that we always talk about and I want it so bad. But guess what I want more? My sanity, my peace of mind, and a real honest loving genuine connection with someone who values me in all ways that I value them. Good luck. Choose yourself. Because your fiance is not. I'm sorry. \n\n\nP.s. I've also broke an engagement over similar. It was so hard to do, but I had to get free of that miserable life. The men never changed. And when I believed that they were going to make the changes they said they would, I always found even worse stuff the next time.",

Now it\u2019s up to you; you\u2019ve caught him once, how many times are you going to allow him to cheat on you?  You\u2019re still young, there\u2019s someone out there that will love you who isn\u2019t a serial cheater",

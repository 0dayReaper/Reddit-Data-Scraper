    "postText": "\nTitle, i\u2019ve decided i\u2019m breaking up with her, but she wants to hangout tomorrow. I don\u2019t want to be with her the whole day if i\u2019m breaking up with her, and i know she\u2019s going to be emotional. We just had a fight 2 days ago over me hanging out with a female friend at a birthday party, not alone, always with others. Recently i\u2019ve been thinking a lot about breaking up with her and how much i dislike being in a relationship with her. I\u2019m pretty integrated with her family and they like me a lot. We\u2019ve been dating for almost 6 months and we haven\u2019t had any problems until this month, but they\u2019ve just been over trivial stuff that doesn\u2019t matter. She also doesn\u2019t like any of my friends really, which makes it hard to hang out with people besides her. I feel like she has no friends, which results in her constantly invading my space and friend group. She also doesn\u2019t communicate with me until it\u2019s too late and then she cries. I\u2019ve decided for sure i\u2019m breaking up with her. The question is do i hang out with her tomorrow and then break up? Or do i wait until after tomorrow to let the news? I just want it to be as easy as possible for her.",

            "comment": "Breaking up with someone is never easy, and I understand that you want to make the process as painless as possible for your girlfriend. However, it's important to remember that delaying the breakup or hanging out with her before breaking up with her can be misleading and give her false hope. It's best to be honest and direct with her, even if it may be uncomfortable or difficult.\n\nBefore breaking up with her, it may be helpful to think about what you want to say and how you want to say it. Try to be clear and concise, but also compassionate and understanding of her feelings. Avoid blaming her for the breakup and focus on your own feelings and reasons for ending the relationship.\n\nIt may be best to have the conversation in a private and comfortable setting where you both can talk openly and calmly. It's also important to allow her to express her feelings and emotions without interrupting or dismissing them.\n\nAfter the breakup, it's important to give her space and time to process her emotions. It may be helpful to have a mutual friend or family member check in on her to make sure she's okay.\n\nRemember that breaking up is never easy, but it's important to prioritize your own happiness and well-being, as well as being respectful and considerate of your partner's feelings",

But, I am just going to keep it real - she\u2019s not the first or last girlfriend who won\u2019t like your friends.. and when you invite someone into your life and commit to them they become just as important as your friends. \n\nBest advice I\u2019ve ever received is to be with someone that is your best friend\u2026 remember this in like 10 years lol until then enjoy yourself",

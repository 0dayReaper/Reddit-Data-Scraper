    "postText": "Update 3:\n\nHey guys, and update has already been posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ccpwcu/update_mom_had_an_affair_18_years_ago_i_18m_am/). Please don't message me so angrily any more.\n\n\\-\n\nUpdate 2:\n\nSorry for not updating, my grandpa passed away yesterday morning.\n\nNothing happened to me, but my situation is a secondary concern right now. Regardless, I think I will be alright, thanks to your amazing support and help.\n\nMy sister is aware of everything, and told me not to worry, she has my back and I have her support.\n\nI promise to update when and if there are any significant changes, right now I need to support my grandma.\n\nThank you again to everyone.\n\n\\-\n\nUpdate:\n\nSorry to disappear, nothing bad happened to me.\n\nManaged to talk with my mom yesterday, but I chickened out half way through what I had to say :(\n\nThe good news is that I am not being kicked out, or disowned, etc.\n\nThank you for all your support, everyone, I will follow through and call financial aid at my college in a few hours, and take it from there.\n\nMy grandpa had a stroke a week ago, and my dad is helping my grandma with setting up a live in nurse, so he wasn't around yesterday.\n\nI will let you know how I manage.\n\nThank you again.\n\n\\-\n\nPretty much the title. I have no idea how to process all this, and I am completely unprepared for what lies ahead :(\n\nBoth my older brother and sister went to the same college. My brother graduated two years ago, my sister is set to graduate in two years. Both had their college paid by our dad. Dad paid all their college expenses, including rent, food, their cars, pocket money, you name it.\n\nMy brother has a job now, his own place, lives together with his fiancee, and has his life together.\n\nMy sister already has a good paying job, and my dad still pays for almost everything for her.\n\nI got accepted to the same college, which was always the plan, and was looking forward to talk with my parents about the next steps, and ask them to help me the same they did for my siblings. I always assumed they had money put aside for my college the way they had for my siblings.\n\nInstead I was met with a story about my mom's cheating, how I am the result of her cheating, and how my dad is not willing to support me any more moving forward.\n\nDad told me that mom had 18 years to let me know and prepare me for the future, but obviously she never did. He said it was never is place to say anything since I am not his son, and didn't want to interfere with mom's parenting.\n\nApparently my grandparents know I am not dad's biological son, but they haven't bothered to tell me anything either.\n\nMy siblings had no idea, and they are as surprised as I am because there was never a hint of anything being off. I might be naive, but I always thought I had a great relationship with my dad. We go to see sports together, we go fishing together, he tutored me when I had difficulties with math (dad is an engineer), he taught me to drive. I never got a hint he stores resentment towards me. I mean, he gave me my name, and has explained what my name means, and he was very proud of it. It's a story he tells from time to time. He likes to talk about stuff like that about me.\n\nMy mom has never said a word about anything, and apparently she was supposed to have \"the talk\" with me, but she never did.\n\nI feel abandoned and unprepared for what lies ahead. I am not even sure I will be able to go to college any more, I always assumed my parents will pay for it. I never had a job, and I am not sure what job I can even get to support me through college, I have no idea how to apply for loans.\n\nAll my mom has done is cry and apologize. But nothing of substance, she has no idea how to help me.\n\nI don't even know if I am welcomed home any more, it's all up in the air, I feel shame leaving my room, and if I will be asked to move out I don't know where to go. I don't have any savings, maybe $400 put together.\n\nI am angry at my mom, I am confused about where I stand with my dad. There's a man out there who is my father that never wanted to have anything to do with me. I feel rejected and I have no idea what to do to fix this situation.\n\nAnyone have any idea what to do here?\n\nDo I apologize to my dad? What do I say to him?\n\nIdk, I've been stuck in my room these past few days, reading and browsing reddit. I have no idea what to do.\n\n\\-\n\nEdit: Comments are coming in faster than I can reply, but I am making a list with all the advice about financial aid, health insurance, getting my own phone plan, etc, things I didn't even think about before. Thank you everyone.\n\nI will try to answer as much as I can, but there's more comments than I can handle.",

He emotionally and financially supported the child, and not choosing to (because he could have easily said something when the wife didnt) disclose to the child how he planned on cutting that support.\n\nCheating isnt okay. Its garbage. Im in no way on the wife side here. Shes made irreparable mistakes.

It's a a terrible situation to be in let alone being 18 and on the cusp of adulthood. That said regardless of a DNA test; **YOU HAVE TO GROW UP NOW. There's no other way to succeed though this.**\n\n This entails you making a plan; for your current and future life. First thing I'd focus on is income. You need an independent means of income to live off. Then budget and forecast your needs moving forward whilst studying. I'd urge you **TO STUDY REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME.** It's probably the best way forward for you. Your *expectation* though that your college degree will be paid for is now moot. If your mom can help in any small way; accept it. Ditto your siblings. Right now YOU NEED HELP. Financially, a place to crash; just until you're on your feet. \n\nAs to your *father*; I'd cut him. Even if he turns out to be your bio dad that sort of decision bodes to a man's character; not his genetics. You don't need that in your life. I understand the biological ties driving his decision; but *that sword cuts both ways.* If he does renege; I personally wouldn't accept his money. My sense of self is too high to allow someone who'd give up on me so easily. \n\nPlan; carefully; use the help offered to you; and you'll learn a lot from this experience. Not just about yourself; but those closest to you too. Remember too: \n\n**IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT; BUT IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE THE MOST FROM IT.**\n\n*Godspeed and good luck!*",

I would guess this to almost certainly be true in OP's case - birth certificate would have been needed for kindergarten registration and driver's license and whatnot.

How can you raise someone for 18 years and not fall in love with them?\n\nMy brother is raising a boy that isn't his and he adores that child. I can't fathom the cold heartedness of this\n\nSince people don't seem to understand what I'm saying about my brothers son as not his. It's not an adoption or step dad situation. His long time girlfriend had a baby that wasn't his. Just like op. But the baby didn't have a dad. Not one that wanted him. So my brother stepped up. Even when him and his girlfriend broke up they still maintained that my brother was his son's father. He's on the birth certificate. He gets his son every weekend. He's going to be there for his sons graduation. For his grandbaby. When his son calls him dad it isn't a lie until he's 18. I don't know if they plan to tell the kid when he's older the truth but it won't be under circumstances where my brother tries to say \"I did my duty I'm done with you now\".\n\nSince people still don't get it the girlfriend got pregnant with another man's kid when she was with my brother. My brother knew the baby wasn't going to be his but claimed him at birth as his. He's not a moron he's a decent human being. Not every man is required to do this that's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that it's not impossible to love a child of infidelity. And if you allow a child to call you dad for years you're an asshole to revoke that title just because the kid turns 18. If your dad you are dad for life.",

Not excusing him, but this doesn't sound like a petty snap decision since both parents would have to know pretty early what the plan was.",

            "comment": "You need to have a calm conversation with your mom. See if you can still live at home or if they're kicking you out. You need to know this immediately to decide your next steps. If they're not kicking you out, that's basic decency. If they ARE kicking you out, talk to your siblings to see if you can crash at theirs, and live with one of them. If not, crash at a friend's until you can get on your feet. \n\n\n If they seriously won't help you with college (and your mom won't help you either) start applying to jobs. The jobs you're going to apply for are going to suck, but if that's the only way you can pay for college and shit, then you gotta do what you gotta do. \n\nStart applying to grocery store jobs and fast food jobs. Customers WILL suck, as people are fucking awful about their food. Customers in general will suck. You can apply online. Retail jobs, especially ones with commission. This means clothing stores like Holister, Nordstroms, Macys, Dillards, whatever there is available. Also jobs like ones at a car dealership, but beware commission only jobs. If you don't sell cars at the dealership, you don't eat. Get a job that pays a base per hour PLUS commission if possible. If not, you're going to get paid minimum wage like at Gamestop. Which sucks. But it's something.\n\nApply to your local community college. You'll definitely get in. Classes are FAR cheaper than a regular college, and you can get your common core classes out of the way there for cheaper (aka your History 101, Political Science, Government, English, one science course, one math, etc). It WILL take longer but it's fine, the classes are easy. After you're done with those you can get your Associates and transfer to a Big College. I reccomend this before going to the college you actually got in to because it is cheaper. You will work at the same time. Get ready for lots of ramen and cheap food OP. \n\n\nAs for loans, do you have any credit currently? The reason I ask is that the higher your credit score, the better loan you can get. That is the easiest way to earn credit. If you only have a debit card, start building your credit. Capital One or Discover have student credit cards that start you off pretty ok. You can apply for these online. Use the credit card that you apply for. Let's say max $100 per month. ~~Pay off about 50-75 dollars on it and leave a little bit that you owe for something called \"revolving credit.\" This will help your credit score.~~ The first loan you're going to get is going to suck ass. Go to your local ~~bank where you have your debit card~~ credit union and ask them about student loans. \n\nApply for scholarships at your local community college and google scholarships. There are so many out there and sometimes people don't even apply! It's free money at that point. You're going to have a busy summer OP. \n\nAsk your siblings if they can pull some money for your first semester at the community college. Then get one of the jobs I told you about before and start saving. If you do college slower, no one will judge you. You're paying your own way. \n\nI wish you the best of luck OP. I'm so sorry this happened to you and that's really shitty of your dad to do this. Most colleges have therapy or counseling for free or reduced price and your area should have a local psychologist or therapist with sliding scale. Head over there. \n\nAlso, do you have medical insurance under your parents still? Or are they taking that away too? What about your cell phone bill? Car insurance? It's important you ask these questions so that you can proceed with your eyes open about if you actually need to pay for those things (I hope not OP. But please make sure). \n\nI'm sending all my love to you. My wife was kicked out of her parents' at 17 and she had to do a lot of this herself too, and I work and study too.\n\nEdit: Thank you kind stranger for the silver! Holy shit, thank you kind stranger for the gold!\n\nEdit 2: Many users have said this and I've learned not to have anything owed on your credit card. Thanks to everyone who educated me! You learn something new every day!\n\nEdit 3: holy crap, a platinum! Another gold! Thanks kind friends!\n\nEdit 4: It's been pointed out to me that it's better to go to a local credit union for a loan and I absolutely agree.",

There's a lot to take in here.\n\nMy world seems to shrink and expand at the same time.\n\nI'd like to talk with my mom, but she's impossible to have a conversation with. I have tried for the last few days with no results. I'd like to talk with my dad, but I am afraid of what else he has to say to me.\n\nI have no credit right now, no credit card, no bank account. I was supposed to take care of these before leaving for college, but now they seem like an emergency, I suppose.\n\nAs far as I am aware nobody is kicking me out right now, nobody told me I no longer have health insurance, or that my phone will no longer be paid for.\n\nThese are things I haven't even thought about.\n\nWhen I said I am unprepared for what is ahead of me I was not joking :(\n\nI will talk with my siblings and see what they have to say or if they can help.\n\nThank you for this comment!",

Im sending you so much strength. \n\nYou need to know where you stand. Your mother is being useless right now. Go to your dad and ask those questions. We can talk again if these are things that are being taken away. \n\nChase has a good program for students. They usually have a student debit card. You will need one to store your money. You need to go in person for this, however. If your mom has no job, a sibling or your dad must cosign. \n\nYour local community college will also have a financial advisor. Go visit them. \n\nI understand you're scared, but don't be paralyzed with fear. The world will NOT wait for you and these things need to get done. You are not completely on your own, you do have your siblings (and when she returns to reason, your mom). You have a support system, which was better than my wife for a time. \n\nIf you lived in my state I'd hug the shit out of you and help you out but I dont think you do. I'm in Texas.\n\nEdit: thank you kind stranger for the silver!",

The big companies like ATT, Verizon, Sprint, Tmobile all charge way more than many resellers. People like Mint Mobile, Republic Wireless, Cricket can get you a solid phone plan under $20 a month with a couple gigs of data and unlimited calling. You have to be very tactical with minimizing your fixed monthly expenses. It will go a long way to helping make sure your bills each month don't stress you out. Anything that is a recurring bill, you MUST research cheapest options. I start by googling something long the lines of \"cheapest phone plans 2019\" \"best no fee credit card\" etc.",

You don't have to give him the questions or read them verbatim, but it can assist you in maintaining some control over the conversation. It doesn't have to be an exhaustive list for your first conversation and you can clearly say to him that you may have other questions later.\n\nI realize you have a lot of practical questions as well as emotional questions, like a simple \"why?\", \"why now?\", or perhaps even \"do you love me less?\"\n\nI would just advise you to keep it simple for now. Get some answers that you really need and give the rest some time. \n\nAlso (this may sound petty but if you do it with purpose, it can help your father reflect on his decisions), you may want to start treating him with coldness. I don't mean being an asshole towards him but if his actions have made you feel like you are separate from \"his family\", then perhaps you should treat him as though he is a business partner or landlord or whatever. Again, to be clear, I don't recommend doing this in a negative or emotional way. Just be business-like.\n\nThat's just a suggestion, I don't know what your father's capacity for self-reflection is, nor whether you will be able to maintain the emotional control needed. I just think that it can sometimes be wise to guide someone to a realization, rather than confronting them. Particularly when it's regarding something that someone has harboured deep-down for so long, since they may be very resistant.\n\nIt's quite telling that he felt no responsibility to make sure you were informed. Thinking \"that's your mother's job\" for 18 years, while simultaneously taking responsibility for your care and upbringing shows a lack of maturity on his part. I wouldn't count on him to have any deep insights if you were to confront him demanding deep answers...",

Leaving any balance increases utilization, which decreases your credit score.

As for you figuring out your college financing. I recommend you go to the local community college for 2 years as they are relatively inexpensive. Then transfer to a State school.

Honestly, everything you said about your mom (affair, keeping it a secret, current hysteria) tells me she's not going to be of any help unless you manage to snap her out of it. Also you dont really need her help, and sorry to say this about your mom with not a lot of info but I doubt she was forward thinking enough to save for your college education on the side. Side note: why the fuck is she making a big show of this now? Her irresponsibility makes me so mad tbh. \n\nDont apologise to your dad, you did nothing wrong. Your dad also did nothing wrong and I hope that you can talk with him and agree to treat each other with respect (which is more than a lot of bio families have)",

They had maxed out the loans they could take out with my three older siblings.  I still went to an expensive private college but paid for everything myself.  I wrote dozens of scholarship essays because I couldn\u2019t get one large one \u2014 one $3000/year scholarship when you multiply it by 10 different scholarships makes a huge difference.  I had to take out about $40,000 in loans and it took me about 10 years to pay off.  \n\nI remember sobbing in the financial aid office my first day of college still trying to work things out because they were using my parents\u2019 old salary and not the current one and they couldn\u2019t even give me a penny.  I had to cash out a $50 savings bond I got when I was born just to make copies of someone else\u2019s book because I couldn\u2019t afford to buy the book for class.  \n\nEverything worked out.  It\u2019s shit and I know how hard it sucks to have thing sprung on you at the last minute.  But you can do this.  Having loans isn\u2019t the end of the world as long as you\u2019re reasonable with how much you take out.  Big hug!",

Your wellbeing is still her responsibility, and when he decided to stay together, he kind of took on that responsibility too.\n2. He's kind of causing a situation where he may cause you to seek out bio-dad. In many jurisdictions, bio-dad is responsible for helping you with your education if he has the means, and a court may agree. Of course, a talk with a lawyer would probably be in order in that case, your mom's affair would become more public, and everyone including Dad would have to relive the hurt. I'm not sure he's thought this through.",

Your dad's treatment of you after dropping this bomb on you is heartless. You've done absolutely nothing apart from expect to be raised and loved by your parents (same as everyone), and deserve none of this. Most people in your dad's situation, making a decision to stay with a pregnant cheating partner, would choose to accept the baby and raise it as their own for life, not just play along then hold it over the kid's head for existing the minute they turned 18. That's the screwed up part. I hope your siblings are better people than your parents, talk to them and see what they think of the whole thing.",

In either one you can get tuition assistance, the GI bill(monthly stipend), tricare, and a lot of other benefits. You should research before talking to the recruiter and, if you're interested, talk to any relatives that have served.",

            "comment": "I am a Clinical Psychologist. I am very sorry that you  are being blamed for your adult parent\u2019s deceptions and decisions - as an innocent party. Your parent\u2019s need to take responsibility for THEIR decision making which is causing the ENTIRE family pain. You have NOTHING to be ashamed of as you have done nothing wrong and are NOT responsible for ADULTS that are lying and miserably unhappy in their marriage. I definitely encourage you to go for counseling, and seek expert guidance to process this, and protect yourself emotionally, so you can move forward with building your life. In the meantime, you need to get a job and grow your financial independence as your family relationships  are fragile  and being led by broken adults that are not protecting their family and creating instability. Then, attend a local community college which is very affordable as an in state student. Seek healthy, uplifting, positive support. This is a critical time to build your support system so that you don\u2019t feel completely abandoned - this is a time to build outside positive support. Grow your emotional (and physical resilience) through daily exercise, daily positive support, nutritional eating habits. Avoid alcohol and drugs to destabilize you - you need your brain to make excellent decision to build your life as your parents do not sound emotionally reliable and logical. This is likely a time when there will soon be wisdom to moving out - but only if you can move into a more stable and healthy setting. And lastly, shame only grows when we keep secrets - and internalize our pain. Do not keep this secret and follow your parent\u2019s unhealthy ways. Be different from them. Let this be your conviction to be honest and have loving relationships that don\u2019t involve lies, deception, and hateful attacks on one another. Counseling will be VIP (and your parents each have a high level of need for counseling). Be honest, tell your siblings the facts, and your closest friends. Seek support. This is not your lie, and not your shame, and not your burden to bear - and certainly not your marital misery. You are not to blame for anything. Now is your time to separate and build your best life possible - with wise counsel.",

I don't even know where to start with that. How do you know your wife cheated, decide to raise the child as your own anyways, give him your name, and everything else, all the while holding that much resentment in your heart? I'm so sorry this is happening to you. :( I'd be lost too. \n\nEmotion aside, go talk to a financial advisor at the school you're interested in. Explain your situation and be honest about it. They should be able to tell you what financial aid you qualify for and how to apply for it. Have a talk with your mom and see where you stand as far as whether you need to move out or not. If so, ask for time to find a job and somewhere to go. Hopefully they'll give you that at least. Once you find a job, look for housing near campus with roommates. It's by far the cheapest option. It's not impossible, it's just going to be hard. Good luck man.",

Pretty much all colleges/universities, even community colleges, have financial and student advisors and that's what they're there for, to help new students figure everything out, fill out all the necessary paperwork, etc. It's a huge help. I was totally clueless about how to apply for grants, scholarships, loans and my advisor walked me through all of it. At my college they even helped with finding housing and stuff. They had an office you could just walk in and talk to someone but I'd definitely give them a call because it's sometimes easier to make an appointment.",

If they are well-enough off, they may be able to help. I would also recommend moving to the midwest for your degree, it's super cheap here. There are decent enough apartments where I did undergrad that run around 3k/year, maybe less. Finally, I would recommend that you learn how to cook cheaply this summer. It's an unknown skill for a lot of people your age, but if you do it right you will be a lot healthier and happier than living off ramen. I am currently able to enjoy a healthy 3000 calorie/day diet on a grad student budget, so its completely doable. If you want more details about any of that, feel free to message me. Good luck!",

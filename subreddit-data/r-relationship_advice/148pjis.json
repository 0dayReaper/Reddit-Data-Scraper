    "postText": "This is going to be a little more of a rant than anything else. I don\u2019t really have a safe place or anyone to talk about this with so here goes..\n\nLike the title says, I just had surgery last week and it\u2019s really depressing me how little he cares. When I bring this up with him he gets agitated and snaps \u201cI\u2019m helping you\u201d but his idea of helping is literally only doing what I ask. There\u2019s no thoughtfulness at all. \n\nWe\u2019ve been together for over 10 years and you would think that even if he didn\u2019t love me anymore, he would actually give one tandem of a shit.\n\nMoving around and walking is hard enough as it is, but when I ask him to find something for me he just gets frustrated and gives up, making me use whatever strength I have to get things myself. \n\nI mean it goes all the way to simple things like keeping the room clear of crap. (Which he doesn\u2019t do btw unless I prepare everything for him to take out.) I had to clean up the room and make it easy for him to take out the trash. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t even replace the bathroom tissue paper for me?? He can very well see it needs to be replaced and nope- not a single fuck in the world given. \n\nThis whole time whenever I\u2019ve asked his help to do something like, change my blood soaked gauze, he gets mad, impatient, and tells me to hurry the fuck up while in a snappy/yelling tone. One time I yelled back saying \u201ccan you just give me a fucking minute it\u2019s not easy for me to move around like this. Have some fucking patience with me or just forget it and I\u2019ll just deal with it\u201d which I feel bad for doing because I\u2019m not a yeller but.. why are you rushing me? What\u2019s the hurry? Why can\u2019t you be gentle and take your time while I\u2019m in this fragile state? He is also not very careful or gentle when helping me with these sort of things. \n\nI really just feel like a burden at this point. I mentioned to him that we need couples therapy and he just flat out rejected the idea. \n\nThis relationship has been shit for a while but I had made plans for this surgery over a year ago and had prepaid for it. It just sucks how I kind of regret not doing it in the state where my mom lives. If only I knew how isolated I would feel and how hard it was going to be\u2026 \n\nHe just became a cop in the last year and a half and has been changing for the worse when it comes to our relationship. \n\nHe even uses the fact that he goes and works against me while I\u2019m home recovering?? He makes snarky comments about how he was at work and not here to know whatever the fuck I\u2019m talking about. That he doesn\u2019t feel like paying attention to my things or keep track of my stuff because he\u2019s busy at work. I rebuttals telling him I\u2019m medicated with pain meds and it\u2019s not easy for me to keep track of this stuff but so what? Not his problem I guess. \n\nLike I get it- as soon as I can walk I\u2019ll go to work but why can\u2019t you spend any emotional energy and effort on me especially when I\u2019m in such a vulnerable state?? I had even asked if he was sure he would be willing to help me prior to the surgery and I guess his idea of help is a lot different from mine? \n\nAre all cops like this or does he just not give a shit about me anymore? \n\nAfter all these years together I never thought we would get like this.. and that I\u2019d get to the point where I am ready to leave.",

I felt like such a slob on the couch not even being able to sit up, and he would point it out regularly.

Personally, I see it as a bad sign for the future. This was something you both knew was going to happen, I imagine you assumed he\u2019d give some kind of support instead of making you feel even worse than I\u2019m sure you already do. He doesn\u2019t sound like the \u201cin sickness and in health\u201d kind of guy, which makes me imagine what things would be like if you (god forbid) had something more medically serious come up. All my fam are cops, and my sister is married to one, who cared for her 24/7 when she was diagnosed with cancer a year into marriage. Your guy just seems like a jerk to me.\u2018I\u2019m sorry!",

Honestly, I\u2019m sure the same would go for you, if you choose that route.\n\nTo be quite honest, I don\u2019t know how much of this has to do with his employment. But then again my family have been in 10-30 years. I know you mentioned he\u2019s a pretty new cop, so maybe he\u2019s got that inflated ego because he finally as the sense of power he\u2019s wanted for so long? Those cops are the worst. In that case, things would definitely get worse for the relationship and him personally.\n\nHard to categorize by their employment. My sister is a girly girl, fake nails (now that she\u2019s a lieutenant), and is incredibly chill. Her husband, a sergeant, is extremely stubborn, but treats her well. My brother, a SVU sergeant, is probably one of the nicest, friendliest people I\u2019ve met in my entire life. Your guy could have just had a shitty personality below the surface that has now come to light with his bit of power and he\u2019s got a bit of a superiority complex!",

In the beginning (aside from all the cheating) he at least still treated me well to my face. That started to disintegrate and he became unbearable to be around. I was so depressed all the time, and he\u2019d always suggest I should just off myself and be done with it. We had moved to a new city, he was working all day night and weekend, and I made one friend (his coworkers wife). She ended up leaving him last year, so I reached out to her about being roomies. Luckily, it all worked out. Everything in the apartment was mine, so I cleared it out. I refused to co-sign his truck loan because he has horrific credit and mine is great (thank god), so aside from the apartment, no financial ties. He sent me some pathetic texts afterwards, and then a neighbor told me he moved in another girl a week later, so assuming he was cheating again.\n\nI was depressed for a bit. Not over the situation because I knew I made a good choice, just over all the emotional shit I was feeling. I will tell you that I started going out by myself to listen to live music. A guy offered me a drink, I declined, but went to thank him. Not my typical big buff hairy older guy type haha, but incredibly sweet, something I\u2019d been yearning for. I gave him a shot and we\u2019ve been going strong for a little while now. I honestly think and hope I\u2019m going to marry him. I used to cry all through my 20s, in bed with my awful ex, wishing I could fast forward to 30 because maybe by then I\u2019d have the balls to get out of my situation. I\u2019m turning 30 next week, and it\u2019s all proven to be true :) I\u2019m sure something like that would happen for you, if you\u2019re willing to take the leap!",

So self care things like a hairbrush, moisturiser, face wipes, hand sanitiser etc. Then any entertainment stuff like phone charger, a book, knitting/crafty things. Also some snacks or a drink and then your painkillers. \n\nThen you can take the bag around with you from room to room in your house. It makes it easier to have these things at your disposal and not have to ask for them. \n\nI'm sorry about your situation, both the surgery and the partner. Has he ever been good at care taking?

You don\u2019t say and if you are not it may be easier to get away from him.\n\nMaybe a friend can come out to \u201dhelp take care of you\u201d while he is at work.    \nAnd you can pack stuff up to either take with you or put in a storage unit.   \nDon\u2019t forget to get all your important documents.   \nAnd remove yourself or him from bank accounts and credit cards. Make sure your money is safe!\n\nIf that is not an option, call your local Domestic Violence Shelter for help, but PLEASE let them know that he is a current police officer. Most officers know where area shelters are, however they may try to put you in one in the next town/city/state over to keep you safe.\n\nGet well soon and good luck!",

Honestly he never really asked? He bought me a glowing ring once and asked me in the parking lot of our place but I don\u2019t think he was all that serious.. \n\nWe have been having issues for a couple of years so I was the one who didn\u2019t push him to commit because I wasn\u2019t sure.\n\nI\u2019m pretty much alone here so I called my mom who is in another state and she said that as long as he\u2019s not physically harming me and is doing the bare minimum, to try to stick it out.. (I also didn\u2019t tell her all of the details because she is already wanting me to leave this situation)\n\nI have another procedure in September and then I really have to start thinking about how to get down to the nitty gritty and move out of there, because I don\u2019t think he will help me.",

I didn\u2019t want to fight so when he asked if I was crying, I said no but I think he could tell something was wrong. He had warmed up some food for me and picked up my meds at the pharmacy. \n\nHe said he loved me and I just told him how I felt like a burden to him and that he doesn\u2019t really want to do any of this. \n\nInstead of answering that, he changes the subject and ignores it/pretends it\u2019s not true every time I mention it. \n\nI told him about my gauze situation and he said he\u2019ll help me change it after he finishes his match in his video game. Ignoring the fact that I asked him to do it yesterday, yet telling me why I didn\u2019t ask him sooner? Wtf \n\nWhy is he doing this? Why is he just gaslighting me and pretending everything is okay? Am I over reacting? Am I being too hard on him? I\u2019m afraid of talking to him because I need him right now and he has been very impatient and short with me. \n\nIdk if this is a part of it, but I stopped my antidepressant since surgery and it\u2019s been making me feel my emotions and I fucking hate it.  I just want to be numb again\n\nI\u2019m in the bathroom crying again trying to type this.. sorry if I don\u2019t respond to any of you right now but I wanted to let you all know I appreciate your responses \n\nI just don\u2019t have it in me anymore \nI really wish I could just disappear and not deal with anything. I know I\u2019m in a bad place rn. Sorry for the negativity I\u2019m just\u2026 so hurt",

                    "comment": "Oh honey, \nIf you have to be numb to be ok in a relationship, it's time to go.  \n\nHe has shown you his priorities, and you don't make that list, unfortunately.  You are seeing what he truly thinks/ feels about you when you are the one who needs caring for. \n\nHe is abusive. Were you a priority his actions would show it, and he would be willing to get professional support (counselling) for your relationship, and he would prioritise your medical needs. Not changing gause can lead to infection. There is no way that would be left by someone who cares, and anyone with basic first aid knowledge is aware of those risks. \n\nPlease reach out to some friends and work out a pathway out of this. You deserve so much better and have so much life left to live. \n\n\nAs a comparison, I spent 4months bedridden, my body was shutting down this right on the back of my child having major surgery and my husband having to return to work to keep us going financially working insanely long days. I frequently found myself sobbing, frustrated knowing I was a burden on my family at that time and also knowing I couldn't do more than exist, and even that took all I had in me. Each time my husband reassured me, told me it wasn't my fault I needed care, and it was just hard right now, but that we would get through it. If I needed fluids, any foods I thought I could tolerate, vomit bags, new meds he got to it just as soon as he could, sometimes this meant late night trips for foods just on the off chance that craving might be something I could hold. When we've struggled to connect, he's been willing to seek professional input and self reflect/ talk things through. It has not been an easy relationship at all. We both came in with our own demons so I don't want this to seem that it's all rainbows and fairy dust, just wanted to show, a normal person who cares would step up and do their best to be a support and you can have that too, you deserve to have that. Relationships are meant to be a partnership, and this doesn't sound like that. It's ok to choose yourself \u2661",

    "postText": "Pretty much what the title says. I\u2019m 26, he\u2019s 28. \n\nNow, I shouldn\u2019t be all that surprised because he always loses everything. Wallet, keys, other important things. We don\u2019t live together but often I keep things in my possession for him simply because he apparently cannot look after any of his things.\n\nIt drives me completely insane, and usually I do just try and see it as \u201cYou know what, his lack of organisation has caused this so I\u2019m not going to get involved.\u201d But this time it\u2019s too much.\n\nI\u2019ve paid for all of this holiday, too. He was going to just be paying me back in smaller increments, and I was happy to do so. I was just looking forward to having some time away together. \n\nProceed to putting in all of our information for our boarding passes (It was a last minute booking), and he explains that he doesn\u2019t have his passport on him but he\u2019ll send me the details I need as soon as he has it. Great, I tell him I want to get it done today so please just let me know.\n\nInstead, I get a text message asking \u201cHave you seen my passport?\u201d \nWell, of course not. I don\u2019t live with him? I said no, why? \nHe replied that he\u2019s turned his house upside down and can\u2019t find it. When I first started to book the holiday I explicitly asked him, \u201cSo you definitely have your passport, which is in date, right?\u201d And he told me there and then \u201cYes, I know where it is.\u201d so I figured I had no reason to worry.\n\nI\u2019m just so upset and angry, and disappointed. He loses everything, my mental capacity has increased tenfold since we\u2019ve been together, I feel more like his mum than anything else. \n\nHe feels awful of course, and is insisting I give him one more day to phone the passport office before cancelling, but I just don\u2019t want to pay more than I already have. Our flight is meant to be next Friday. So now I just know that I\u2019m resigned to just having to cut my losses, and pay an additional cancellation fee on top of a holiday that I\u2019m not going on.\n\nI tried opening up about how I\u2019m feeling, that his lack of care and attention is creating a huge issue between us (Not the first time that something like this has happened because he isn\u2019t organised) and his laid back, go with the flow personality is really conflicting with my over the top, anxiety driven organisational one.\n\nI love him so much, but I\u2019m so tired. Every time we talk about it he gets upset and says about how he doesn\u2019t deserve me, that he\u2019s sorry, that he\u2019s trying to get better. But it\u2019s cost me so much now, it\u2019s hard not to feel resentment towards him right now. What can I do to not keep putting salt into the wound for him, but also get through to him how much I need him to change his attitude?\n\nAny help or advice is appreciated.\n\nEdit: Cancelled the holiday. Going to cost me half of what the total was in cancellation fees.\n\nTold my boyfriend we need to talk tonight. Not too sure where it goes from here.",

            "comment": "Does he have ADHD? Because that sounds a LOT like ADHD. \n\nHe won\u2019t get better without developing systems for keeping himself organized. They need to be systems that HE devises, so he knows they\u2019ll actually work for him and that he can actually stick to them. He may need a coach to help him get ideas for these systems. And it will take time for him to get into the habit of actually following the systems. \n\nWays you can help:\n-Empathize. You can let him know you\u2019re frustrated, but by responding with \u201cI\u2019m really disappointed we can\u2019t go on our trip; I know you must be too.\u201d Vs blaming him really goes a long way. People with ADHD/organizational challenges already know we let people down ALL THE TIME through our lack of executive function skills. Making him feel bad about it is unproductive and only furthers the shame spiral.\n- Understand he\u2019s not doing it on purpose, nor is he lazy. His brain just doesn\u2019t work the way yours does. Secure his permission to gently nag him about things that need to be done. I have done this with my staff at work and my husband and it has helped me get stuff done so much better. With the ADHD brain, so much is out of sight= out of mind. \u201cWere you able to get X done today? Do you need any help?\u201d Or \u201cHow did X go?\u201d \n-When he\u2019s ready to implement systems, help him out again with gentle reminders. \u201cDidn\u2019t you decide all your important papers were going to (here)?\u201d\n-Help him brainstorm where the lost item might be. Sometimes when we are in a panic about losing something, our brains short-circuit and we can\u2019t remember. Walk him through- \u201cWhen did you last have it? Can you remember what jacket you were wearing/bag you were carrying?\u201d I\u2019d be unsurprised if it\u2019s in a pocket or the bag he used on his last trip.\n\nI can totally understand your frustration. I hope it all works out for you two.",

At least that way, it might help him feel better about these things because although there\u2019s not exactly a \u2018blame\u2019 to put on it, he can understand more about why he finds it difficult to recall things or remember where he puts them. I don\u2019t know, it might help him feel less like he\u2019s \u201cthe bad guy\u201d if he knows there is an underlying cause. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s an excuse of course, but seeing him beat himself up everytime is really painful. It\u2019s so hard to keep consoling him while feeling hurt about the outcome myself, because I know that if I tell him that I\u2019m upset it will make it worse.\n\nI have tried to walk him through (even offered to look around his house myself) everywhere it could be. He went to America 5 months ago, so he had it then. It definitely doesn\u2019t seem to be in any pockets or bags, since I\u2019ve already made him look in there first. \n\nI think that you\u2019re right in that he needs to create his own ways to stay organised. If he refuses to at least acknowledge that part, then I know that the problem lies a bit deeper. If he can accept that he needs help with it, that\u2019s something I can work with him on.\n\nThank you again for your advice, it was really helpful.",

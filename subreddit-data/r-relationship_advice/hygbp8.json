    "postText": "My boyfriend and I was going to have sex with each other (it was supposed to be my first time but not his)\nThings started off normal, kissing. Then he started pushing me on the bed and holding me down, no foreplay or anything. I was obviously shocked and scared because I didn't expect that. I was screaming stop and no and he stopped. He looked confused and asked what was wrong. I told him like wtf, I thought we were gonna go slow. He was still giving me a confused looks and at that point, I was annoyed. I reminded him I was a virgin so I would prefer to take things slow. He said he knows that but he thought I'd like it rough. He also told me he's never been with a black girl before and he thought black girls like rough sex. I was mad and I said no, I'm not ok with rough sex and I was mad he used a stereotype on me. I didn't want to have sex anymore and I asked if he could just leave me alone so he left. \n\nI'm just so confused like how is this even real. I've never even heard of that as a stereotype. Idk if it's a porn thing or not (I don't watch porn, just not into it) but even if that's a thing, I'm mad he just assumed things about me. He knows I'm a virgin but he still was rough with me. I'm unsure now bc idk what else stereotypes he has about me bc I'm black.\n\nEdit: he's blowing up my phone asking me if we can talk about things and saying sorry. I feel bad for not responding but I keep thinking what else he thinks about me. I feel empty inside because he turned into another person when he got rough. He went from sweet to cold and scary. I think once I'm calm, I will talk to him.\n\nEdit: all of these messages have been overwhelming. I'm going to call him now and hear what he has to say. I will update after. Thanks for the advice, this has been very helpful.\n\nOkay last update cus I can't make a new post and this is getting really cluttered with replies.\n \n\nSo we talked for a while. I'm done with him. I read the comments and I decided to hear him out, I gave him the benefit of the doubt that he didn't mean to hurt me. He told me he thought black girls like it rough bc his friends girlfriend like that (she's black) and the porn he watches. I tried explaining how that's racist to think that and consent. He said he was sorry for rushing into it but he was raised in a racist community so 'give him a break'.\n\n I tried explaining that's not an excuse to act out his fetishes on me especially without asking. He got mad at me and I was too. We argued and then I broke up with him.  I am really upset rn, I thought he loved me but I guess not. All I wanted was to share a special moment with him and he ruined it. I told my friend and she said to give him another chance but I disagree. What he did was too weird and creepy for me to forgive him. Anyways thanks for all the advice, I should have just broke up with him immediately but oh well, too late now.",

I came a long way and comparing how I stood in my first relationship with how I stand in my current one, I guess I could say that I had no confidence at all. It really showed in my (sexual) relationships, I did many things against my will. Things on which I wish I had stood up for myself more and things I could\u2019ve avoided if I just spoke out. Now I just consider it as a part of my life journey, because obviously I can\u2019t change my past and also over time I developed boundaries, learnt how to stand up for myself and got better in communicating. I\u2019m still not where I want to be but I learnt from my mistakes and every day I get more and more confident in my relationships and also in general",

You see, it's not uncommon to see someone talking about racist thoughts during bed here.\n\nSorry about the poor english.",

Because black women are naturally more voluptuous than other races they used it as justification for the CONSTANT rapes and gang raping. Their bodies are simply asking for it. Sarah Baartman\u2019s story is the perfect example of this. \nAdditionally gynecologist James Marion Sims, considered the father of modern gynecology, plays a significant part in this. He created this idea of the \u201cstrong\u201d black woman. He used it to justify performing experiments on slaves. Most of these experiments were performed without anesthesia. They are strong they can take. To this day black women struggle with this branding and are more likely to die during child birth. \nMedia has continued this stereotype by how black female characters are usually portrayed, the mammy,the femme fatale, or the strong woman. But HipHop/culture has probably been the absolute worse for the image of the black woman. I don\u2019t think that requires much explanation. Lol",

As black women, we know to ask to have any concern we brought up noted in our file, as it then holds the doctor accountable in the event it was a serious issue. Or you die, and your family needs to know why and how.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just a small part of our existence. Imagine not being able to trust a doctor to care about your life??\n\nI haven\u2019t read through all these comments and I won\u2019t for my mental health.

Why they were transporting people is a mystery, but some have suggested the melanesians were captives kept like livestock to be eaten by the polynesians. \n\nBeing black with frizzy coiled hair has caused a lot of people a lot of grief through history, and still today in Fiji racial tensions are high.",

(Think of how people talked of Tamir Rice at the time of his death, and he was 12; think of how black teenagers who are shot to death are talked about; think how people about the black girls who are sexually assaulted, especially those that fought back and are punished for it.)\n\nThis image of black women specifically is a dangerous one (it\u2019s dangerous for men, too, of course, but that\u2019s kind of addressed when talking about violence against black men, and we\u2019re talking about black women at the moment) because it doesn\u2019t acknowledge black women\u2019s humanity and vulnerability, and are often considered shields and martyrs when they shouldn\u2019t be (if you\u2019ve seen discourse advocating against calling black women \u201cstrong\u201d, this is why \u2014 its a similar thing as why calling medical workers, essential workers and others \u201cheroes\u201d isn\u2019t actually beneficial for them). \n\nAnyway, since black women are considered \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201ctough\u201d all the time, assuming we like  rough sex too (despite saying otherwise) is in the same wheelhouse, IMO.",

I don't like telling people to break up with someone so I'm just going to say maybe sit him down and have a serious conversation with him about stereotypes and let him know that when you did was absolutely unacceptable and then he better not ever do that to another female. I'm assuming that the conversation where it goes will lead you to the right decision what to do. but I know one thing literally common Sense would say if I have never had sex I wouldn't know if I like rough sex or not. but I know rough sex is not the way to introduce a young woman to her first sexual experience.",

I don't think you should give him another chance and here's why.  He didn't see *you*.  He saw an object from porn.  If, he were indeed emotionally attached to you he would have recognized that you were new at sex and what your general personality is like.  He would have seen you as an individual in a vulnerable position.  Instead, he saw something to stick his dick into.  Even worse, he assumed that everyone with a specific skin tone shares specific sexual tastes.  The lack of just everything you'd want in a boyfriend is overwhelming- no empathy, no kindness, no awareness of who you are, no desire to set up a mutually fulfilling sexual relationship.  I can't imagine how frightening that must have been for you.  I'd move on.  Find a guy who really sees who you are and cares.",

His actions were horrendous, and even if it's his kink and the kind of porn he likes to watch, it's no excuse. As your boyfriend he was supposed to care about you and make sure you felt safe, loved and that you had a good experience your first time, but instead he attacked you.\n\nI am so sorry that you had to experience that. Know that you deserve so, so much better. His behaviour is a big red flag and personality I hope that you don't give him a second chance. Because his view of women, especially woc is scary. \nAnd when you dicide to have sex for the first, second and the 1000th time.

His actions and presumption about you is characteristic of the type of person he is, of his own racism. I know it's hard to hear this, but trust me there are even boys who date black girls just to brag to their dirt bag friends that he \"banged a black girl\". Black girls have been overly sexualised everywhere and from a very young age too, and your boyfriend is what you get when you couple that misogyny with ignorant racist little shits.\n\nDo not give him another chance. Don't make that mistake. Break it off. Even if it hurts now, you'll know you're doing the right thing after a while.\nI'm so sorry for what happened to you. That is not how one needs their first time to be. Take care of yourself x\n\nEdit: I have read some other comments saying at least he stopped when you asked him to so maybe he's still redeemable, let me just tell you, just because he didn't rape you doesn't mean you should give him another chance. Why the fuck do we set such a low bar of decency for men?\n\nAnd others telling you to educate them? Wtf? It's not your job to educate them.\nIf you're visiting or living in some Asian or European country where they have little to no population of African descent, I'd understand educating them about your culture and life and daily struggles, but if you're from North America or UK and such, then fuck them!

I'd say have a serious conversation with him to dispel whatever foolish preconceived notions he might have. Remind him that you are NOT a stereotype and be very clear about what you expect going forward. Communication is key. You are a virgin, and you have every right to decide the terms of your first time. EDIT: I feel the need to add, this is all separate of if you decide to try and sleep with him again. You can still have this conversation and try to dispel some of these toxic-ass ideas but still tell him that you're not comfortable pursuing things further. \n\nPersonally, I could understand why you might not want to stay with him.",

As many of the other replies have told you, this is not going to be a one time occurrence in your relationship where his preconceived notions of black women will affect you negatively. If this relationship is to continue in an non abusive way, he has to admit as such that he has some racist, toxic ideas and he needs to actively work to deconstructing every thought he has about race. It\u2019s a lifelong process and he needs to enter that journey willingly if he\u2019s to keep dating you or any other black woman. If you accept his apology and you accept his excuse that he\u2019s not racist, it was just an isolated incident, you are going to have a future of disappointment with him.

    "postText": "I (26F) met this guy (29M) on a dating app. I wanted a long term relationship and he also wanted a relationship, but did mentioned that he was not in a rush. We talked on the app for a week before he asked me for my phone number. Then we talk again for another week before our first date. It went well and we went to our second date the within the week. On the third date, he get a little more touchy and flirty which I did not mind because I personally like him a lot and he have many qualities that I was looking for in a guy. \n\nFast forward, we did end up having sex about 6 weeks after knowing each other. Then after about a month, I brought up what are we talk and ask if we plan on dating officially, but he said that he \"don't know where relationship fit into his end of year plan\". When I asked about it, he said that he plan on going to festivals and concerts in the end of summer and fall and not sure if he could just leave me behind and go. \n\nThat left me thinking for the whole day because it just does not make sense to me. He made all these plans before he met me and valid to live his life. I don't expect to tag along or make him cancel his plans. So I ask him again what did he meant and what he wanted out of our relationship. To which he answered that he \"enjoy hanging out with me\" and \"want a relationship but he feels like he cannot give 100% into the relationship\". \n\n\nWas I too rash in bringing up the official talk? Should I stay and wait until he is able to commit to the relationship or should I take this as a hint that he's not ready for the relationship and move on?",

    "postText": "A little background\u2026 my (36f) partner (39m) works full time as a first responder and on top of that owns a business. There have been a few minor setbacks with the business, but all is smooth right now. During his busy season (which is 6 months), he is literally a figment of our imaginations and I\u2019m basically a single mom. (No complaints, I love that he\u2019s so driven). When the season is over we\u2019ve always taken a week long vacation to spend some quality family time together. This year due to some of the setbacks, he has said he\u2019s not sure we could swing the vacation. I would be disappointed if it didn\u2019t happen, but I wouldn\u2019t get upset at him. I\u2019m a positive person and also work, so I\u2019ve been keeping hope alive and putting some money aside myself. \n\nPart 2:\n\nMy husband\u2019s cousin (30m) recently got engaged. They\u2019re very close and he\u2019ll be having a week long extravagant bachelor party somewhere in the Caribbean a few months after we would usually take our trip (which is still during his off season). It crossed my mind that he may be planning on going, even if we didn\u2019t go on our family trip. \n\nSo I brought it up to him, and I let him know that if he skips our trip, but has money for a bachelor party\u2026 I\u2019d be VERY angry. It seems that this was his plan and now I\u2019m just super annoyed. We don\u2019t get this time back with our children, and we hardly see him for months on end. Before we know it they\u2019re going to be too cool for us! \n\nAnd before anyone asks-\n-He\u2019s a wonderful dad and partner\n-We have always had such a great time on our trips.\n-Our children are 5 and 3\n-On his off seasons, he\u2019s still incredibly busy, we just see him more often as he has more flexibility with his schedule. \n\n\nI just feel like he\u2019s putting others before us\u2026 we love and miss him and just want to spend the time together. What would you do in this situation?\n\nETA: \n-He goes on a ski trip, a camping trip, and a weekend in AC with his firehouse every year, plus a few boys nights out. \n-The trip we would be taking is to Orlando to his fathers timeshare (free stay) and we have driven and enjoyed the drive- I also have plenty of miles to use on an airline sponsored credit card so either way we wouldn\u2019t be spending much on the travel part",

If the only trip the husband went on per year was the family one, I'd get him, one time, being like, \"This bachelor party is important to me, I want to be there for my cousin, I need a week with just the guys,\" etc. But this man goes on a bunch of vacations every year, and it seems like there's money for those! Dude's being shitty. If he can't afford the family vacation and the bachelor party, he should be skipping his other trips.\n\nI do wonder if OP has ever expressed to the husband that his six-month busy season is difficult for her. Not that she should *have to,* but this guy might need to hear, \"It's incredibly difficult for me to hold down the fort on my own for half a year every year, and I miss you during that time. I look forward to the family trip all year, and it's extremely disappointing for me that you don't have money for that but do have money for trips that don't include me and the kids, since we have so little time with you.\"\n\nOverall, I feel like OP is trying to do the Cool Girl thing of, \"Oh, it's fine my husband works constantly and spends a lot of the rest of the time on trips with his buddies; I admire his work ethic, and he's an adult who gets to do what he wants, blah blah blah.\" But like, at a certain point, when someone is choosing to spend his limited free time with just about everyone but his wife and children, you have to consider the likelihood that he is just selfish.",

You didn't indicate you've talked to your husband about how difficult it is that you're essentially a single parent for six months a year, and you downplayed the difficulties in the post in a way that's common with folks who feel like they have to push down their own needs in favor of their partners. I'm not trying to imply y'all don't or shouldn't love your husband, but he isn't being kind or fair right now, and I hope you realize that. It is selfish for him to take a lot of solo/friend trips and blow off a family trip when so much of the family work falls solely to you. That doesn't make him an irredeemable asshole, but most people aren't either perfect or awful, you know? This guy is somewhere in the middle, like most of us, and right now his behavior is more on the \"selfish/childish\" side than the \"family man\" side. That's a problem.",

Not to mention setting your kids up to learn from an early age that their needs come second to their parent and future partner.

Above side projects. Above buddies. Above all else.\n\nWork is work. A business is work. Both of those are important but it sounds like somewhere along the lines he started valuing his income above his family and he stopped thinking of this income as family income and only as his income.\n\nHere is the thing - in order for him to pull those hours, he relies upon your household labor. He would not be able to work those hours if you were not a full willing partner.\n\nSO, he wants YOU to take a back seat yet again for his whim of going on a luxury vacation. What do you get out of this? What does the family get? Big man gets all the money and all the fun while the little lady stays home with the babies?\n\nSis, there is no equity in this relationship. He genuinely does not view you as an equal partner in any capacity and he certainly does not view you as his equal. Think hard about this relationship - the amount of time he is off living his best life is on your back. He spends a TREMENDOUS amunt of family money on his own leisure activities and it sounds like in return he simply expects you to take it on the chin again and again.\n\nYour husband needs to grow up. he is NOT a good partner to you. He is not a good friend to you and he is a crappy father if he is choosing to put his own whims and leisure above family time.",

Its one more vacation in your list of annual \"me\" trips you have chosen to take. If you knew this was coming you should have taken both the money and time out of your ski vacation, your guys nights out, your weekends away with the firehouse. Again and again you choose to spend family money on your own selfish whims without any thought as to our family or me. Your selfishness is astonding. Truly astounding. This is not something I will compromise on. We are either partners, equals, or we are not. How, exactly, do I or our family benefit from all of your \"Me me me\" vacations? We don't. So, my question, is at what point WE come first? At what point do I rate above your buddies? Would you like it if the roles were reversed? Would you support me spending copious amounts of family resources on me me me vacations and activities while you were expected to stay at home caring for the children?\"\n\nThat said, OP, you need to get back to work full time and he needs to scale back his business. If he can't be present 6 months out of the year because of his side gig then he needs to not be doing the side gig. That side gig comes on YOUR back. The only reason he can do it is because you have absorbed all of the family care and management so he can have that time. He takes you for granted and truly does not see you as an equal.",

If you had the annual trips with friends you and nights out during the week then announced due to shortage of money, he could stay home with kids instead of going on annual family vacay and you were going to fly to the Caribbean for a week long bachelorette party? Bet if he is honest, he would not like it. IMO he committed to marriage and being a father, this means his responsibilities to his family should override his cousins bachelor party. He is given plenty of opportunities for fun while going out with his buddies during the year.How often do you get to go out with friends for a fun night?  Need to talk to him and let him know this is not acceptable to you and could harm your relationship. Maybe it is time you get a job and let him help with the kids more. I understand he works hard to support his family, but you also work hard keeping his home clean, clothes washed, kids taken care of and get no \u201cdown time\u201d.  Usually nothing good ever comes from a bunch of men drinking and having a week long trip in another country. Distance and alcohol can lower the inhibitions of even the most faithful spouse, after all how would you know if something were to happen. I am sure it will not be only a guys weekend for the single guys( and possibly some of the married ones)otherwise why go so far away?",

As annoying as it is, I recommend the kill em with kindness approach. Listen to everything he has to say and calmly give your counters and your side. You have, in my opinion, such a firm case, that confidence and sincerity alone should make your side more believable. Hoping all goes well, and please treat your self a little!",

You describe yourself as basically a single parent. Now instead of the one opportunity per year you get for uninterrupted family time, he wants to fuck off on a boys' trip? When he already goes on multiple vacations with his buddies every year?\n\nI think you've been playing \"cool wife\" for too long and now he's taking advantage. You said if he does this you'd be very angry. And? Is your anger and hurt enough of a consequence for him or is he going to do it anyway? If your feelings aren't enough to change his mind, I would consider what would be. Perhaps this money should actually be bookmarked for couples counseling so you can discuss his priorities.",

While you stay at home and ENABLE him to do those things, and all you ask for is ONE family trip. The standards are low. Ofc he's a great dad when he is there because he gets to take breaks whenever he wants and travel and do fun shit while you're at home. You NEVER get a break. Raising kids is 24/7, meanwhile he gets to. So yeah I'm sure they do get the best version of their dad bc youve spent your life making sure he gets to live his life to the fullest.",

If he's such a great dad (don't know how he can be if he isn't around more than half the time), he should be able to take care of them and manage the house for a week, right? Does he even know where everything is, who his kids' friends are, what their schedules are? \n\nGood dads show up. Good dads are there. My dad was a serious workaholic (took three people to replace him when he retired), and even he'd take off work for me at least a couple of times a year. Does your husband do that? Even during the busy time? Could you count on him to drop everything if you went into the hospital or one of the kids did? Does he have a plan for that, one that doesn't involve making you handle everything by yourself?",

I'd put money on his barely actually knowing them, their dreams, their stories, all of it.

He may be the type of person who needs those breaks quality over quantity, and you seem to understand that, but you can\u2019t choose one over the other, it simply is a matter of AFTER the family vacation is covered whatever is left and what he can save can dictate if he can go to part of the bachelor extravaganza.. maybe it\u2019s only 2 days but that\u2019s compromise, and fair because it seems that you would be comfortable with that too.",

If the income is for the whole family and you pay taxes together and all that, what\u2019s with not  being involved in the household\u2019s finances?\n\nAlso how expensive is this trip? It\u2019s a week long, can\u2019t he go just a couple of days instead?",

He\u2019d then get a huge wake up call because he\u2019d see what she does. \n\nHe\u2019s gotten so used to thinking about himself and knowing you won\u2019t say anything to dissuade him, that you\u2019re not even a consideration.

One day he\u2019ll want to spend time with them, but they\u2019ll be busy and won\u2019t.\n\nI hope you guys can get on the same page and be a team. A stronger partnership and family.

    "postText": "\nI just want to preface by saying I am not proud of this. I understand what I did was wrong. So, I met my girlfriend back in December. And the story of how I met her is a little odd. We met after an \u201cex\u201d of hers posted her nude images, among other things online. I knew her a bit up to this point, have seen her in passing in person and online. But we never really struck up a conversation or anything. I\u2019ve always thought she was attractive, just never knew how to talk to her. And so when I saw that this guy was posting a link to various things that he claimed to be hers, I was obviously curious. I did unfortunately look at everything, and was filled with immense guilt after. \n\nThe guilt got to me, so I messaged her and told her that I just saw what he was posting and saying, and that I was extremely sorry. That he was an ass and she didn\u2019t deserve it. She asked me if i clicked on the link to look at everything, and in the heat of the moment I messed up and said no. Said That I didn\u2019t see it or her nudes, because I was ashamed and didn\u2019t want her to see my apology for what occurred as insincere. In the months after we grew close, and about two months ago we became official. Which is great, I love and adore this woman. \n\nBut the other day we got into the topic about her ex, and she told me about the amount of men that looked at the link and offered \u201capologies and comfort\u201d in the aftermath. She was disgusted with them, and rightfully so. Her exact words to these men were \u201cIf you looked at my pictures knowing what you were going to see, I want nothing to do with you.\u201d Which is fair. And expected. Many of them probably did just want the things that were showcased in her images. But I swear, with me it was not like that. I felt disgusting and guilty after I looked. And it feels like this is something I need to fess up about. I feel disgusting and dishonest. But I don\u2019t know if I do it now and risk losing her, or wait and hope the foundation we continue to build is at some time strong enough to withstand time telling her in the future. Or if I just don\u2019t tell her at all, because her trust has been breached so badly lately. I don\u2019t know what to do here, and when or if to talk to her about it. What do I do? \n\nTLDR; I lied to my gf about whether or not I saw her leaked nudes before we got together. I don\u2019t know how, when, or if I should tell her?",

You did it because you wanted to see it. Feeling disgusted *afterwards* is irrelevant, you clicked on it for exactly the same reason those other guys did - you thought she was hot and wanted to see her naked. You messaged her for exactly the same reason the other guys did - you thought she was hot and thought *maybe* there was a chance you'd get to talk to her if you reached out with sympathy.\n\nAbsolutely do not sit on this in order to manipulate the situation into her being more comfortable and therefore having a hard time dumping you. She deserves to know now. The guilt is already eating at you so it will come out eventually, and if you build a whole life together it will become an atomic bomb.",

But the reality is that he will suffer damage to his character the longer this lie goes on. I wish I had been able to own my lie earlier than I did. \n\nDaniel Tosh has a line about how if I guy has ever gone to a costume party with a girl, it\u2019s because he has cheated on her and thought \u201cshe deserves this from me\u201d. He makes it funny in context, but the concept stands. This lie at the foundation will affect how you (OP) treat her, how you will sacrifice yourself to make yourself worthy of her, and how that will ultimately lead to bitterness in your part. The sooner OP is able to find his integrity, the sooner he will be ready for his next relationship. \n\nAnd if by some miracle she accepts that you were ashamed when you reached out and forgives you, that is worth building a relationship on, because you will know she is able to love you despite your mistakes. But given her statements about what guys did, I wouldn\u2019t expect that. What I would expect is that she suspects you looked and that\u2019s why she said what she did about the other guys.

It developed into a commitment and then into marriage. We were very open with each other about many things in our past in the beginning because it wasn't supposed to continue. Looking back, it would have been better to keep some things left unsaid. There are some things he told me that I wish I never knew, related both to me in the first months we met and things that happened before we met.\n\nEven if she does forgive, there will always be a black cloud hovering above and it will severely impact, if not completely destroy, the relationship. If OP can't live with himself because of this, he should separate himself from her and move on, but do her a favor and give her a different reason. Never tell her he looked at her pictures.

They were shared directly to my now boyfriend about 2 years before we ever even met (the photos were shared in person, along with several other people on different occasions. so i admit online nude leaks are MUCH different and not something i\u2019m personally familiar with, but i am familiar with the shame and anger she\u2019s feeling, and maybe i can provide some insight from the other point of view). \n\nhe came forward to me about a year or so into our relationship that he had seen my pictures, and how he felt creeped out and disgusted with himself for seeing them and actively looking, and then after meeting me and finding out they were mine, felt even worse.. and i\u2019m sorry, but we\u2019re only human. we see some leaked nudes of a girl we know but don\u2019t know that well, and it\u2019s taboo, we know it\u2019s wrong, and that\u2019s why we click on them and that\u2019s also why we feel bad after. \n\nI forgave my boyfriend. i felt like supreme crap that he saw my body before we ever even knew each other, but i told him it\u2019s alright, that i was sad and angry that he was shown them without my knowledge/consent, that i hated the person that showed him\u2026 but i made sure he knew that i didn\u2019t blame him for looking. i blamed the person that showed him. \nand i thanked him for being honest with me. \n\n because what was he gonna do? stick up for some girl he barely knew? no. even the most mature and brave people have problems with calling someone out on their inappropriate behaviour, and even more so fessing up to their mistakes and bad choices\u2026 and there were boobies right in front of him! he was damn well gonna look at them, even though he knew it was wrong. like i said\u2026 only human... primal urges are real and no myth. \nlike i said, i don\u2019t blame him for that. he didn\u2019t have any commitment to me at the time, so how can i get mad at him when it was impossible for him to be personally malicious toward me? he had his own agenda, and it had nothing to do with me. i know that. \n\ni can only get mad at the fact that he actively looked at someone\u2019s obviously private photos-and that\u2019s peer pressure- but bad choices most of all. people change and grow up, they learn from their mistakes based on how they feel afterwards. i bet you won\u2019t do that again. \n\nTell her. tell her tomorrow and don\u2019t back out. even if you two end up not staying together, it\u2019s better than lying to her for years, and telling her further down the line when you think you\u2019ve built enough of a foundation. if you do that, she will feel like she doesn\u2019t really know you, that the foundation you built together will be based on a lie, she won\u2019t trust you, and it\u2019ll suck even more if you break up. \n\ncommunicate. you have to tell her sooner or later. if she doesn\u2019t accept and forgive you for your bad choices and all, then it wasn\u2019t going to work out anyway, i\u2019m sorry to say. \nin a relationship we have to learn to live with what the other person is and the choices they have made, their character flaws, and if we can\u2019t live with it, then it\u2019s not meant to be. \nyou are who you are- and for whatever reason, you clicked on those photos and made that choice. \njust be honest with her AND yourself about why you did it. she might hate you in the end, but that\u2019s her prerogative. she will hopefully at least appreciate your honesty above everything else.\n\nso yeah, stop hiding it. you\u2019re only hurting the both of you the longer you do. \n\nmy advice on telling her? just say it straight up. give her no room to hope that what you\u2019re about to say is a good thing. start with the dreaded \u201cwe need to talk\u201d, then dive right in. tell her you lied , that you saw her nudes, and let her talk. hear her out, let her yell, let her feel. and this one is important- don\u2019t try to defend yourself (however difficult that is). she needs to know that this is truly something that you regret, and if you try to defend yourself with saying things like \u201ci just clicked the link\u201d or \u201ci didn\u2019t know you that well\u201d or \u201ci\u2019m only human\u201d these will only make her feel like you don\u2019t actually regret it, and you\u2019re trying to justify it. i know i\u2019m saying all those things now, but she doesn\u2019t need to hear it- it won\u2019t change how she feels.  those are things that are true imo, but she will have to come to those conclusions herself (and she might not ever feel that way, and that\u2019s ok. my values and beliefs are probably very different from hers, and i know i can be sometimes overly accepting of peoples mistakes. probably because i\u2019ve made some pretty bad ones in my life). \n\nit\u2019ll feel bad. you\u2019ll feel like crap throughout the whole conversation. tell her how you feel, tell her honestly why you did it, tell her everything. be an open book. don\u2019t try to minimize how bad it is. don\u2019t try to make yourself a victim, and don\u2019t overplay how bad you feel either. that will only make it seem insincere.  definitely tell her just HOW bad you feel, and don\u2019t sugarcoat, but working up crocodile tears or berating yourself in this conversation won\u2019t help. trust me. \n\nremember that this is about her, not you and how bad you feel. \n\n\nand who knows, maybe your girlfriend will understand, maybe now that she knows you better she will understand you more than the other men that apologized about it, and why they did it. and you guys can be happy and stronger in the long run knowing that you both feel comfortable sharing your deepest regrets with the other. \n\ngood luck man. i sincerely hope that you can work this out with her.",

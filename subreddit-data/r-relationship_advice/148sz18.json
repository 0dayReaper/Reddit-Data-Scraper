    "postText": "My girlfriend and I have been together for about a year and 4 months now. It has been a rocky start to our relationship but I finally thought we were at a point where we were past that stuff. So i got a DM from a random man on Facebook stating that my girlfriend had posted a picture of us to a group that apparently posts picture of men whom the poster is dating trying to see what info they can gather on the man. From what I can tell it usually turns into bashing the man. The group has something like 20000 members from my area and it is female only. \n\nThe post about me had a few people I know write things about me. Most was good but two posts were outright lies and were completely slanderous.  \n\nIn my opinion the group is totally in the wrong and I don\u2019t think it is okay to be posting random men and slandering them without their knowledge. \n\nI was not comfortable with the fact that my girlfriend posted our relationship like that and gave everyone and their mother a chance to tear me a new one. I spoke with my gf about it and she maintains that she sees no problem with it and will continue to be an active member of the group. Speaking of which she is a top contributor of the group and comments alot apparently. She told me she is sorry that my opinion on the matter differs from her and that I should just stop bringing it up. \n\nMy main thing is why does she need the opinion of 20000 random people to know if she can trust me(which btw i have given her absolutely no reason to believe she can\u2019t). Also her reaction to me bringing it up is a concern. \n\nI am a grown ass man I am too old to be pulled into this shit. What do i do? How do I go about trying to get her to understand where Im coming from without being met with defensiveness, aggression and gaslighting?",

I do think it\u2019s pretty silly to post your boyfriend, though, like if you\u2019re trust is so broken to feel the need to ask these questions, there are probably bigger issues.",

I think the whole idea of these groups are horrid. \n\nPerson who told him could have a fake profile I guess or just have been a female friend who wanted him to know but didn\u2019t want to personally be involved so wanted to be anonymous. \n\n I have a friend who was posted like OP &amp; his female cousin told him and sent him screenshots about it? There are a lot of pretty normal ways to find out about it. \n\nMost people in my own personal experience have tagged photos with their significant others on social media. From the pure nature of the group chances are GF posted his full name so it would be pretty easy to find him.",

This is actually so frustrating because a large portion of these groups are at risk of being shut down because of people misusing them like this. \n\nIn the group I\u2019m in, posts like hers would be deleted by mods immediately. There\u2019s no reason to post someone you\u2019ve been with for a year unless you are actually, legitimately suspicious that something is going on and have proof but need confirmation.\n\nI do not blame you for being upset with her and I\u2019m sure this feels like a massive betrayal. She was way out of line here. If she cannot see how posting *her long term boyfriend* to this group for the purpose of \u201cgathering information\u201d instead of just talking to you is insane, I\u2019m not sure this is salvageable.\n\n\nETA: OP \u2014 I see you\u2019ve provided screenshots. Your girlfriend mentions a \u201crocky start\u201d to your relationship and \u201cfinally\u201d thinking she was able to trust you. If you\u2019re not being fully truthful or forthcoming in your post here, nothing I said above actually applies. Would be helpful to know what your girlfriend was referencing in her statements.",

A man who has a woman in his life who has done something to hurt him is allowed to seek support without you pretending he's saying \"all women do X\" and \"all women are wrong.\" \n\nYou just hate men so much that you can't mentally separate an individual who is hurting and needs help from the idea of men as an adversarial force in your life. You can't allow a man to ever seek sympathy, or ask for advice, it if involves discussing a woman doing something negative, because it would challenge your world view that all men are bad and all women are the victims of men. And so when a situation like this presents itself, your knee-jerk reaction is to invalidate him, misrepresent his problem/argument to make it a gender vs. gender issue, and try to shut him down because you don't think of men as individuals who are accountable for their own actions only. You think of them as just a part of the collective idea of men, who should all be punished for the actions of their gender. \n\nI hope you don't have sons, because you are going to destroy them by teaching them to hate themselves for the actions of other people.",

People in these groups are not reliable, and if you need to ask yourselves a question like this, \"is someone else dating this guy?\"- how about breaking up? \n\nDoesn't this sub say, \"relationship ends when trust is lost.\"",

            "comment": "I think the only thing that really matters here, is that she doesn't trust you. Obviously it's weird that she is decided to try and get stories from other people to \"try to trust you\" (which, let's be honest, is BS, she's not attempting to trust you more with this at all, she's looking for a reason to end things), but really, you're a year, 4 months in, and she just doesn't trust you. If I were her, I wouldn't do *this*, I'd just leave.  \n\nI'll be honest. Doesnt matter the purpose of the group to me, and I think everyone arguing it, as well as asking you for more context on how the relationship started in the comments, is missing the point. The issue is that she doesn't trust you, and isn't actively trying to do so, because let's be realistic here, She's not going to *be able* to trust you because people *don't* trash talk you, you can't prove this negative. \n\nI think your relationship hasn't had a future for a while now, if this is how she feels. And especially because you appear a bit blindsided by this, which indicates that you are not working with her to solidify her trust in you (I may be wrong with this, granted, but it doesn't look like you're taking an active part in helping her trust you here).\n\nSo it's up to you. Do you accept that whatever the rocky start was from, has broken her trust, keep trying to gain it and start actively working towards that....or do you call it a day and go? \n\nYou seem to take more issue with her being so active in this group, tbh, than that she's posted you. And I do want to say that that is an okay reason to go as well. Tbh, if I took an issue to a partner and they told me that they wouldn't change and they were \"sorry I felt that way\" and that I should just stop discussing it...well, that would be a good reason for me to end things. \n\nI think your relationship is over, and you two just haven't admitted it yet.",

People often say \u201cearn my trust\u201d but while people can be trustworthy or do untrustworthy things, whether you trust them or not is largely a matter of you and how you feel. At the end of the day, she can\u2019t really trust you, whether you deserve that or not. Many say that without trust, there isn\u2019t really love. At the very least, there isn\u2019t any peace. It doesn\u2019t seem like anything you do can earn her trust, and you don\u2019t seem to want to keep working to earn her trust either.\n\nIn that sense, I don\u2019t think this relationship is right for you.

I can make a lot of assumptions as to the why of it all, but to put it bluntly, she sucks, but I'm pretty confident you do too.

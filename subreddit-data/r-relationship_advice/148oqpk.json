    "postText": "Hello everyone. I'd like to start off by pointing out that I am 57kg/125lbs. I am an average height. Tonight, while I was taking a bath, my boyfriend noticed my tummy and touched it, jiggled it kinda and made some jokes. He said some things about me not eating chocolate and ice cream anymore, and that I should be on a 'ice cube only' diet. After, he said my arms, legs and other parts of body are so beautiful but I have tummy rolls. Two, to be exact, and I should start by losing at least one. This isn't the first time he said something like this. He also mentions quite often we should both go to the gym and be active so we can be healthy. I was quite understanding of that and I thought he truly meant we should both have a healthy lifestyle, but now I feel like he just wants me to lose weight so he can be attracted to me or feel good about himself. Now, I could also tell him some things about his body but I don't because I don't really care. I see him more than his body. \nIs this something I can look past? How do I approach this topic with him? Do I really need to lose weight just because I have tummy rolls and he told me to? \nTLDR; Boyfriend of one year makes jokes and says I should lose weight because I have tummy rolls.\nI'd like advice on how to navigate my feelings and this subject with my boyfriend. Sorry for mistakes if there are any, english isn't my first language.",

It sounds like his actions and words are not making you feel respected. You need to have a serious conversation about boundaries, respect, and acceptance. \n\nIt may just be that his affections are so shallow that he thinks he will be happier with a girl who has less body fat than you, and while that may well be true, he also probably doesn't appreciate the fact that there is so much more to your relationship than your body. If that is the case, let him go try to be happy, and put yourself in a situation where you don't get brought down by his judgements.",

We\u2019re women. We\u2019re all supposed to carry a little extra there. It\u2019s why women struggle so hard when trying to achieve a flat stomach. There\u2019s always just that little bit of stubbornness that won\u2019t go away. Because it\u2019s normal and healthy for us to have. \n\nFlat stomachs are unrealistic. Sure, you can pose for a picture and make it look flat, but even a quick search on Insta will show you when a girl isn\u2019t posed or using compression leggings, even the most fit girls have some belly fat. \n\nI don\u2019t trust any man who suggests harmful things like this without knowing biology. He sounds naive, selfish, and should probably take a break from social media. \n\nI think you deserve much better.",

    "postText": "My BF(20M) and I(20F) have been together for almost 4 years. We have a rough relationship. I met him while I was in high school. We didn\u2019t go to the same school. We met at a park playing basketball. Two complete strangers who met with the same interest.\n\nMy boyfriend after less than a year into our relationship cheated on me. He claimed it wasn\u2019t cheating at first. He had told me this rumor going around where this girl in his class had her nudes leaked. A day later he\u2019s showing me his IG and is looking up a meme page and a girls IG was in his search bar. It was the one he had talked about. I asked him and he said he was just seeing if the rumors were true. Unintentionally admitting he was looking for them. I felt broken. He throughout my breakdown harped on the fact that \u201cat least I didn\u2019t really physically cheat with her\u201d. \n\nI forgave him after he and I really sat and talked about it and how he did realize it was cheating and he wouldn\u2019t do anything like it again.\n\nFast forward years later and he added a girl on IG that he supposedly worked with once. She\u2019s the same age as us. I only found this out because I had a gut feeling that something was off. I rarely ever look at his phone but he said I could if I ever needed after several problems we had with him and mistakes.. I\u2019ve only ever checked it with him and say he can opt out of me doing so if he feels uncomfortable. \n\nThis girl is also an EMT and they did transfers together for one day. I sat and talked with him about this and he told me he asked for her Instagram for work communication. He also said regardless of it being a girl or a guy, he adds all of his partners. I respect this 100% but I feel like Instagram has a bad rep in our relationship and we both have said we don\u2019t mind the other having girl or guy friends we just need to be open to talking about them.\n\nThis all got my mind going because when he started his job we were looking for chips and he grabbed a bag and said \u201cone of my partners liked these she always has us stop somewhere for some\u201d. He seemed so interested to try it. I didn\u2019t think much of it but apparently he added all his partners for communication purposes. And she happens to be the only girl he has worked with in his words.\n\nThis partner he recently added he  \u201crecently worked with her but only one time\u201d, in his words. This didn\u2019t seem to add up to me since he worked with one early in his job. I asked if this was the same partner that liked the chips and he said no she was a different partner. I said \u201cif you add all your partners, why didn\u2019t you add her too\u201d? He went back on his word and said \u201cI\u2019m probably just forgetting who I worked with and said the wrong thing. I\u2019ve only worked with the girl I added. The other one is just one at the station probably and I only add the ones I ride with\u201d. I feel in my gut he\u2019s getting caught in a lie just like he did when I caught him trying to find nudes and it\u2019s almost like after 3 years the cycle is repeating.. That\u2019s why my guard is up and this all feels off..\n\nI just need to know if this seems like controlling thoughts or reasonable thoughts because he seems to get off-put by talking about this and I just feel it\u2019s necessary reassurance for the past emotions starting to surface.\n\nTLDR; Boyfriend has emotionally cheated before by trying to find a girl he knew from school\u2019s nudes, 3 years later I feel he\u2019s cheating again with a girl he has worked with because I question his reasoning and he changes his story.",

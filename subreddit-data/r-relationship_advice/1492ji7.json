    "postText": "I'm starting to loose it.. \n\nLong story short.\nMy gf and i have had a really turbulent last month, with issues that couldn't be resolved by themselves. She dumped me and i became devastated, we both sat down, hugged, cried together. She said she didn't want to really leave me, she didn't want me out her life, but she saw no other way. So i begged for a second chance, she said \"okey, you'll have a second chance\". So I've promised to fix myself, get my shit together. \n\nBut now i feel like she doesn't care however we fix it or not. She's been acting really distant, not especially talkative about what is going on and i have a problem trusting her, by some key things that has happened since we decided to repair this relationship. It feels like I'm trying to fix this alone.\n\nIt's driving me crazy, i can't eat, sleep, work. She tells me she wants to repair, but still actively avoids me, doesn't show any kind of hope and does some strange things i can't seem to justify. \n\nI've told her, multiple times, that if we are to repair this i can't do it alone, you need two to be in a relationship and that if I'm going to fix myself, she needs to fix her issues too or it will just go in a circle. Instead she's just magnifying her issues and won't tell me what she needs.\n\nAny women or perhaps a man who can guide me through this? Is it even fucking worth it..?",

If there are problems, tackling them together should be the natural thing for you both to do. You\u2019re still young; you have plenty of opportunities to meet someone with whom you\u2019re better matched. It sucks, and it will hurt, but walk away.",

But In reality she was just in different ways. I told her about how I was feeling and she told me she cares about the relationship and wants to fix it. So even though it didn\u2019t feel like that sometimes I trusted her. It paid off and now we\u2019re doing pretty good. But she could also be mentally already done with the relationship. If you truly want this relationship to work I say keep trying no matter what. It\u2019s hard it sucks and many people may disagree with me. But hey it just might be worth it.",

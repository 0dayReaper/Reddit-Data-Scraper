    "postText": "my ex bf and i broke up around 7-8 months ago, i know quite a long time, i\u2019ve already moved on from that but ever since, i haven\u2019t \u201ctalked\u201d to anyone else. i\u2019ve met people along the way but none that genuinely interested me. well around 4-5(?) weeks ago i was on tinder (i decided to give it a shot) and i come across this guy \u201c1 mile away from you\u201d, handsome guy and it seemed we had similar tastes. i see his instagram on his bio so i decide to follow it, i didn\u2019t think much of it until couple days later i receive a text from him saying \u201chi i noticed you followed a while ago, just wanted to say hi\u201d i felt this sort of adrenaline? it was like \u201cno way this hot guy is hitting me up first\u201d so then we begun texting for couple of days until i out of nowhere told him to not take it in a bad way if i didny reply anymore because it\u2019s not \u201creally my thing\u201d i really don\u2019t know why i said that, i guess i was just confused and \u2026 idk. i guess i pushed him away which is really understandable, i did apologize after that of course. the thing is, i DID want to talk to him, i still do. our texting streak ended unfortunately after 3-4 days but he would occasionally reply to my stories, i must add he was very enthusiastic over text and kind of flirty but overall really funny and nice to me. he hyped me up with whatever i said, he even suggested we hang out and that we\u2019d be great friends. well , that was 2 weeks ago and i can\u2019t stop thinking about him. i would text him but he would just leave me on delivered it was obvious he wanted me to leave him alone so i texted him apologizing for my behavior and that i\u2019m sorry if i was being weird or creepy, i explained to him that maybe i did get attached real quick because he was the first actual \u201cinteraction\u201d \u2026 or like the person i had genuine conversations with after my ex boyfriend. i know this means nothing since i never met the guy even tho we live really close to each other but i can\u2019t stop thinking about him. i don\u2019t have a crush on the guy that would be silly but \u2026 what is it? he has unfortunately moved on (btw he never replied to my last apology) i noticed he reposted a girl and left cutesy comments which is obviously fine with me i wish him best, i removed and unfollowed him already. why am i thinking about this man so much? i feel impacted and sad i self sabotaged whatever this was, a possible friendship?",

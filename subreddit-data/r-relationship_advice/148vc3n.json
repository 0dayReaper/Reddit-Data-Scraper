    "postText": "I\u2019m going to try and keep this brief and just give the key facts. My now ex-boyfriend and I are both in our 40s and have been dating for 2 years. We have had some ups and downs and even parted ways very briefly at one point for a week or two. We have no major issues other than we could communicate better and sometimes when we hit a rough patch, we don\u2019t deal with it the best and I\u2019ll admit some of that is from me. We have been working through those things and getting better everyday. But at this point in time, I was floored to hear that he was not totally sure or ready to take our relationship forward really in any way\u2026 we do not live together, no kids together, no shared bills, nothing. At this age and with 2 years in, I told him I could no longer deal with this uncertainty with no forward motion, no plan, no timeline, nothing after this much time and that the relationship is making me unhappy and making me insecure. \n\nI feel like I made the right decision but has anyone faced something similar and if so, what did you do? How exactly did things turn out for you? Was setting this boundary and sticking to it the best approach?",

            "comment": "Hi. I\u2019m a bit younger than you. My ex bf was kind of the same way. I met him and knew I wanted to pursue a long term relationship with him. I let him know that I have plans to seriously date, and I\u2019m dating for marriage. He repeatedly showed me over the course of a year that he was not serious through his actions. He did not plan for the future, he put in very little effort towards the end, he was late to meeting my parents, he did not include me in his life milestones, etc. I realized I could not work with someone who did not respect me and could not hold themselves accountable for their own actions. He was extremely defensive as well, which is a relationship killer. So much resentment built up on my end from his passive personality and from him being rude to me (ignoring me, neglecting me during literally the worst period of my entire life, etc.). He clearly hated me, and I was so done.\n\nI had to be strong enough to draw the line at the one year mark and walk away. It still hurts like hell to walk away from someone you thought was the one and put in so much effort, but they did as little as possible so you were at a tolerable level of unhappiness. They don\u2019t truly love you; they just love the benefits your presence and free labor bring.\n\nI know personally that I love with my whole heart and I put a lot of effort into my relationship. The person I am with gets my full attention and support, and I am very loyal. I incorporate them into my life and my decision-making. I am also extremely picky and I do not allow just anyone access to my life and energy. I know for certain I am a good partner. I also know for certain that a relationship will fail if my partner doesn\u2019t match my energy. I cannot and will not accept a partner that does not reciprocate or exceed the same level of energy and desire for a true partnership.\n\nIt sucks, but you did the right thing. Although I miss him, I know we will never work out unless he figures out his issues. I know if I try to reach out again, he will just continue to believe he can string me along and treat me horribly. And I genuinely hope he never reaches out to me until he sorts out his issues. In the meantime, I\u2019m working on myself so I can date again and find a partner who will love me and build a future with me. We both deserve people who are excited for life with us and want a true partnership full of lots of laughs, love and learning. Wishing you all the best.",

I really needed to hear the reassurance that this was the right decision and I definitely feel like I gave him plenty of time, space and opportunity to prove himself and he never showed up the way I needed. \n\nI 100% agree, we need and deserve someone excited to be with us and take things to the next level.

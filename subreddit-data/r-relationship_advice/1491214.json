    "postText": "A few months into us dating I told him that I sold my body to men from the ages of 15-17. I was sexually assaulted by grown men constantly throughout these years. This was really hard for me to admit as my ex used to abuse me for this and i feel so much shame and embarrassment around it, it was a huge step forward for me to share that with him and I was very proud of myself for it. I have also talked about it jokingly before because if I don't laugh ill cry lol. \n\nWe have been living together for almost a year now, and all of the sudden he says that I should've given a more serious reccountment and that he deserves to know what happened because it affects him. He knows about all my mental problems, I research and talk about them in depth and what my thought processes are when I'm experiencing PTSD so we can have a better understanding, he's seen them first hand, he has seen the product of what my life has made me very clearly, I just don't understand why this isn't enough. I still carry ALOT of shame around these years and what happened to me there, I gave him a better idea of what was going on, although I really didn't want to, I gave him quantities and time frames. \n\nI probably haven't completely healed from these years of trauma and I really don't want to re live it for him to see. The fact I didn't get into more detail or 'give a better understanding of what happened' makes him really upset, we are the most productive couple I've ever met but he got real emotional last night and we can't have a productive conversation today either. He says 'this effects us and its something I deserve to know'.\n\nIs he entitled to know more than the information above?",

The fact that you told him some and it\u2019s not enough for him is troubling. Are you in therapy still? If not get in asap and discuss this with them. He is not a professional he isn\u2019t \u201caffected\u201d by the fear and rage and self doubt your experiences caused you and it\u2019s insane to me that he feels entitled to hurt you further.",

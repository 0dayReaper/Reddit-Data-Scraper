    "postText": "Hi Reddit. Sorry that I always come under these circumstances, but I guess I\u2019ll start from the beginning. If you want to know my history with bf look at a previous post of mine.\n\nLast week my boyfriend had sex with me while I was asleep. I don\u2019t know for how long and was completely asleep when it happened (no memory). In his words, he put it in for a few minutes and did not climax, but I will never know. We had sex prior, but the same night that we we had sex he apparently had sex with me \u201con my side\u201d while I was asleep. \n\nHe confessed after I woke up to immediately go to bathroom in the middle of the night. He came with me to go as well as, which he\u2019s begun to do lately which I find concerning. \n\nWhen we returned to bed, he casually mentions how the second time we had sex was great. I look at him with pure horror and ask what he means. No reaction. He plainly says the second time on my side. My thoughts race and begin to panic. I ask him was I awake. He says I was pushing my butt to he and I was wet. Then I ask him more feverishly if I was speaking to him with my eyes open and verbally consenting )I sleepwalk but never sleep-sex?).\n\nHe said I was conscious, breathing and reacting to him, and assumed it meant it was okay. Sheer horror. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t the first time this has happened. He did this one day 2 years ago. I told him no plenty of times that day when he tried fingering me when I was half asleep in the morning. I woke up yelling at him NO after saying no least 3 times before he could do anything else. His excuses now and before are the same.  \u201cI thought it would be good for the both of us\u201d and \u201cI wanted to be spontaneous\u201d. He says if he was trying to be sneaky or suspicious ge wouldn\u2019t have told me.\n\nI\u2019m really worried Reddit. A long time ago, a similar incident of unconsentual touching happened with another girl in college (we met there) and I thought it was a misunderstanding. He doesn\u2019t like to talk about it. \n\nFrom what he\u2019s told me, he took one night 3 years ago of me saying I wouldn\u2019t mind you rubbing me awake at night to initiate sex, as an \u201cOkay\u201d to have sex with me in my sleep. And I feel that someone who clearly penetrates someone in their sleep is not well whatsoever. I don\u2019t know how I never woke up, and in a way I felt like I betrayed myself. He didn\u2019t climax he says but he\u2019s the only one who will ever know I suppose.\n\nUnfortunately he also confessed that he has been having sex with me in my sleep on and off for sometime of the relationship. I went to OBGYN took tests and everything came back clean thankfully. I spoke to OBGYN and he suggests I leave the relationship. Rape hotline also said the same as I may never know when this will happen again.\n\nI really haven\u2019t been the same since and I feel sometimes like I go into hysterical breakdowns then go back to my life, back to work etc. His reasoning for having sex with me because I was conscious is a sign to me that he may never stop. He was upset that I didn\u2019t believe his reasoning. I\u2019ve thought about sleeping with full clothes or setting up a hidden camera to catch him next time. But none of that matters now. \n\nI\u2019m still in relationship with him but my future husband would never rape me. This is clearly something serious. \n\nI\u2019m going to get therapy (I have my own history of verbal, physical, emotional narcissistic abuse from my father). I know me making excuses for him is a problem in itself.\n\nI demanded my bf to get therapy but even with him in sessions now I don\u2019t think I will be staying with him. I need advice on how to go through breaking up with him as I am beginning to find it harder and harder to do so.\n\nI know this is stupid and the answer of what I should do is obvious.",

Your feelings are valid. \n\nThat being said \u2014 I don\u2019t know this guy and I don\u2019t want to make assumptions. You\u2019re in a relationship with him, so I\u2019m sure he\u2019s not just an all-around terrible guy with disgusting motives/morals/values. \n\nMy boyfriend and I have had a conversation where I have explicitly said that I am ok with this particular thing. That said, if I ever told him to stop, he would. Your initial story about you yelling \u201cno!\u201d is a red flag, and does worry me about his intentions.. But again, this is your boyfriend of how many years, so I think it\u2019s reasonable to give him the benefit of the doubt from my position(again, I don\u2019t know your entire history, so I could be wrong).\n\nIf YOU think he is worth it and being genuine, I think it would be worth it to have a conversation with him. He sounds like he needs to be explicitly told that you are not ok with this. Boys are dumb sometimes, especially when they\u2019re horny. His desperate-horny brain very well may have believed \u201cshe said X was ok, so Y must be ok\u201d \u2014 I have 100% grinded up against my bf in my sleep and he thought that I was awake until I literally woke up in the middle of it confused af. I have even initiated shit in my sleep and he thought I was awake. It is an easy misunderstanding. But again, YOU know him, I don\u2019t. So you need to decide if this man deserves the benefit of the doubt, or if he is straight-up taking advantage of you. \n\nAnd there is nothing wrong with trying to have a conversation to determine where to go from here. All I\u2019m saying is that if this man was good enough for you to love him, maybe he\u2019s not just a rapist, maybe it is a misunderstanding, maybe being told \u201cthis is never ok and I need to verbally consent to *everything* before *anything*\u201d is what he needs, if that\u2019s what you need. And that\u2019s ok. \n\nI have never been in a relationship where we have made it a rule that he or I MUST verbally consent to anything &amp; everything, so maybe not everyone is used to that. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it, but every arrangement needs a conversation and not everyone wants to ruin the vibe by locking eyes and asking \u201cAre you consenting to this or just sleep-grinding on me??\u201d if there is no prior arrangement to do so. \n\n*AGAIN*, this is *your* decision and *only you* can determine what is right here. I just feel the need to offer a different perspective besides \u201cthis guy is an absolute monster\u201d, cuz maybe he\u2019s just oblivious and needs a slap in the face with reality about this kind of thing. \n\nNot that it\u2019s anyone\u2019s job to \u2018fix\u2019 this guy, but I would hope one would at least try to make him understand that his habits are dangerous and he should reconsider these actions with *any* girl going forward. \n\nThis seems to have affected you heavily, do you have access to therapy or similar resources? I think it would be beneficial to also work these feelings out with a professional. You deserve to feel heard, and cases like these can really benefit from the proper tools to cope with these traumatic feelings. I wish you all the best, hun.",

As that can happen and definitely respect your relationship as I think that may be the type of relationship he wants.\nThere have been times where I\u2019ve woken up and we are having sex and I don\u2019t remember who started it. I assumed I didn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t stop it as I trusted he wouldn\u2019t be doing it. Also it\u2019s my bf I like having sex with him though I see now how bad it was I didn\u2019t ask him how we started and maybe because we never talked about it he assumed it was fine to continue. I think that\u2019s where the confusion started bc I didn\u2019t stop the first time, but consent is important. I was at first concerned of sleep walking but I know I would NOT penetrate myself with his genital in my sleep. He often says when he is masturbating at night, my leg will lay on his. I\u2019ve even rubbed him awake to see if he would like to have sex as well. But that\u2019s the thing. If I love someone I\u2019ll ask them I won\u2019t just make that decision for the both of us and risk it ending us unless we\u2019ve explicitly agreed we were into sleep sex (I\u2019m not into it but definitely because I need trust who I\u2019m doing it with in my sleep). He\u2019s explained and shown me he didn\u2019t think too hard to face me, wake me up, and ask me. Not once or twice but numerous times that I don\u2019t have memory of. The only reason I know is bc he told me, but I can\u2019t stop wondering why didn\u2019t he just wake me up (put a cold washcloth to my face if you have to bc if I\u2019m sleepwalking that\u2019s a problem.) Yes there are nice aspects of him. But if the supposed love of my life can\u2019t even move to see if I am awake to make love to me, it must not matter enough.

We can\u2019t control what we do in our sleep, and we can not give consent in our sleep. REM(rapid eye movement, during sleep cycle) causes our sexual organs to \u2018react\u2019, so it\u2019s hard to tell if someone is also horny, or just deep in sleep. I think this is a huge factor because women get \u2018wet\u2019 in their sleep, as a biological response to REM. It\u2019s just science. So you may feel \u2018wet\u2019 to him, making him think he has the ok because he thinks you\u2019re into it. This is something he should be taught as well. \n\nCommunication is key. My relationship is completely different from yours, and consent looks differently in every relationship. The only difference between mine &amp; yours is that we have made clear boundaries and both are on the same page about them \u2014 it sounds like you are not. I personally would be ultra-pissed if my bf woke me up with a cold wash cloth just to make sure I was ok with him doing that in my sleep lol. But again \u2014 have that conversation with him. He needs to understand that you would prefer that \u2018rude awakening\u2019 to the alternative. Your feelings are valid \u2014 and your sex life should look like whatever *you* are comfortable with. \n\nYou made some good points \u2014 if he was being malicious, why would he tell you about it? It would be one thing if this was a recurring thing, you\u2019ve had the conversation before and told him you\u2019re not ok with it, but he continues. To my understanding, this is the first real conversation you\u2019ve had about it. \n\nI would argue this whole situation is a simple misunderstanding of him thinking you\u2019re ok with it based on your prior conversation, and the two of you not having a proper and serious conversation about sexual boundaries. Not that anyone is at \u201cfault\u201d, but I think there is a severe lack of communication that has resulted in some misunderstandings, and therefore trauma on your part. He needs to acknowledge your feelings about that and how it has affected you, and if you would like to continue the relationship, you need to have a conversation about your personal sexual boundaries, and what you are and aren\u2019t ok with.",

So don't worry about that.  Worry about yourself though - what is best for you and your mental health? You don't have to report him if you aren't comfortable doing that.  It is not your responsibility to fix or report his behaviour, particularly when doing so could be very traumatising for you. If he's a rapist that's his responsibility not yours. Many of us women are the victims of rape, including me, and many of us have not gone to the police to report our rapists, including me. I refuse to feel guilty when I am the victim: the rapist is the one that should feel bad!\n\nIt doesn't sound healthy to stay with your bf.  He is going to keep making up excuses as to why he thinks it's ok, but basically he just wants to have sex with you while you're asleep and he's not concerned about what you want or what you don't want. I doubt he will just stop now.  And I don't think it will help to bring him to your therapy sessions - dedicate those sessions to you and your needs, and he can do his own sessions if one day he wants to change. But people change if and when they want to change, they don't change on someone else's schedule.",

Love is wanting the best for the other person. Caring for them. Respecting their boundaries and not causing them harm. This man is causing you harm, very much on purpose, for his own selfish satisfaction. That's the very definition of a r\\*pist. He does NOT love you.  \n\n\nI know it hurts to love and not be loved back. But this is what's happening, you love him and he doesn't love you back, for him you're just an object, not a person. I'm sorry for being so blunt but that's exactly what's happening and why you MUST leave him.  \n\n\nAs for how to leave him, exactly, can you move out, at least with roommates? If you can, try to first secure a place to live and say nothing at all to him. Move your important items there first, like documents and other items you don't want to lose. Then, inform him you're done with the relationship and move the rest of your belongings. You don't need to explain why you're ending it if you don't want to. He's not entitled to an explanation if you're not comfortable giving an explanation. Just repeat \"I'm done, is over\" like a broken record. If you feel that he will interfere with you taking out your belongings, enlist the help of friends or even the police if you don't have trusted friends.  \n\n\nAnd just don't listen to him. He says only lies that benefit him, he's not looking out for your best interest. Also, getting him to therapy will not help. R\\*pists are notoriously resistant to therapy in the sense that even when they have court mandated therapy, and they have to assist, they go but they make no improvements. There's plenty of research showing that this is the case.  \n\n\nThis is not your fault. It's his. But you deserve a life free from abuse in any form.",

I\u2019m afraid for anybody who he will meet in the world and what he would do to them. there\u2019s no excuse even if you\u2019re in a relationship you can still rape somebody, this is clearly affecting you and he doesn\u2019t seem to have any remorse for it. I know this may not be what you wanna hear but I think you should report him to the police. because with this mindset he can easily do the same thing to somebody else and it\u2019s very scary to put somebody like that out into the world. he needs to learn there are consequences to his actions. i\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t feel safe leaving somebody who doesn\u2019t know the proper way of consent out into the world.",

Unless it\u2019s been discussed that you don\u2019t mind and find it a kink, or a turn on or something and you give him permission to do it then yeah it\u2019s rape. And the fact that you\u2019re coming across horrified when you speak to him about it and he doesn\u2019t see a problem is concerning. This isn\u2019t something you appreciate or say yes to, so it\u2019s wrong. I don\u2019t know if I could stay.",

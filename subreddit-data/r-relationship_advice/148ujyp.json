    "postText": "Advice please re \u201clying\u201d.\n\nHello, I am so confused and have never reached out to something like this in my life but I am questioning my own sanity right now.\n\nMy partner and I ended up in an argument as I thought he had lied to me about something (is still unclear but I accepted their explanation and wanted to move on). He seemed very angry I accused him of lying and I admit I could have raised it with him better. I have apologised but since he has given me a level of silent treatment, withheld affection and pointed out many things that he disliked about me or have done wrong and even called me \u2018bipolar\u2019 (I\u2019m not bipolar - I was just very upset). His reasoning for calling me bipolar is because I told him I love him one moment and then \u201cwas upset the next\u201d.  He says I just focus on myself and I never consider him. I feel awful and confused and have been trying to fix it. Whatever I say just seems to make it worse though and I get upset and then cry - this makes things even worse! \n\nI did get very upset and he said it\u2019s the worst he\u2019d ever seen me - making me feel crazy. I said he bought out the worst in people, which I shouldn\u2019t have said. I was trying to explain that is not normal for me to act that way - that his treatment of me had caused it. Of course this upset him (understandably) and I did apologise but feel he is still angry. \n\nWhen trying to discuss the issues he accused me of lying which actually blindsided me. First he said I lied about X (which then he admitted wasn\u2019t true he was just angry), instead then he said \u201cnot telling me things is lying and that I do lie\u201d - again a little taken aback I stopped him there and asked calmly to please please explain what I have lied about as is very important to me and that I definitely never lie to him. \n\nHe responded with something that shocked me quite a bit.  I was sexually assaulted at one point and I only just knew him at this stage, it was very hard and I hardly spoke to anyone about it. He does now know about this - but I didn\u2019t tell him until about 12 months afterwards and it was incredibly hard for me to tell him as I  find it humiliating and traumatising / plus I hardly knew him when it happened and was dealing with it myself. \n  \nI do not talk to him about it, as previously he has asked me things like \u201cdo you do anything to encourage it\u201d - which I found incredibly insulting and upsetting. For the record, it was unexpected and forceful. \n\nAnyway - back to \u201cmy lie\u201d. So he said that I had lied to him because when we had been together a few months I had told him (I cannot remember if he asked or I offered the info) that I hadn\u2019t had sex with anyone but him since we started seeing one another (we both had previously had other sexual partners and both knew that). He said today that  I am a liar because I had had sex when I was raped and therefore I lied to him (bear in mind this nearly two years ago).  I technically see what he means but I\u2019m still shocked -  it was not consensual, it is a traumatic memory and it\u2019s not a little detail that you just through into a conversation (oh, yeah, I have also had sex with another \u2026..when I was forcefully raped)\u2026\u2026\n\nI am so confused. Is it wrong of me not to have told him earlier , should I have clarified my sexual interactions with him? Am i am liar? \n\nI felt like we were getting someone when we talked today but right before I was feeling content and the phone call was about to end he added that he is removing an activity we usually work on together (I help with his home work, we read articles together and discuss stuff, I love it, I\u2019m very intellectual and is a way we really connect, we have discussions for hours and bounce ideas), he said I need to respect this decision when I got upset about it. I respect it but it hurts as feels like a punishment and I was banned out  of nowhere  - am I being too sensitive ? \n\nI\u2019m very hurt. Can you please help me understand his POV?  At this point I feel like I\u2019m crazy and am questioning everything I do.",

            "comment": "You are not in the wrong for not sharing your traumatic experience earlier or for feeling hesitant to discuss it. Experiencing sexual assault is a deeply personal and painful event, and it's entirely up to you when, where, and how you choose to share that information. It's understandable that you would want to protect yourself and only open up when you feel ready and safe. Your partner should respect and support you through this process, rather than using it against you or making you feel guilty.\n\nIt's concerning to hear that your partner has resorted to calling you names, pointing out your flaws, and even accusing you of lying. These actions are not healthy or respectful in a relationship. It's important to be able to communicate with each other openly, honestly, and without fear of judgment. Your partner's behavior, including the silent treatment and withholding affection, could be seen as a form of emotional manipulation or gaslighting.\r  \n\r  \nGaslighting is when someone undermines your perceptions, memories, and feelings to make you doubt your own reality. From what you've described, it seems like your partner might be engaging in this behavior by invalidating your emotions and making you question your own sanity. It's crucial to recognize that gaslighting is not acceptable and can have long-term negative effects on your self-esteem and mental well-being.\r  \n\r  \nIn any relationship, it's important to feel safe, respected, and supported. If your partner continues to exhibit these toxic behaviors and refuses to engage in open, empathetic communication, it may be worth considering whether this relationship is healthy for you. **Remember, you deserve to be with someone who treats you with kindness, empathy, and understanding, especially during challenging times.**\r  \n\r  \nUltimately, the decision to end the relationship is yours to make. It might be helpful to seek support from friends, family, or a therapist who can provide objective guidance and help you navigate this situation. Take care of yourself and prioritize your own well-being above all else.\n\n\r  \nIt took me 10 years to tell people I highly valued about my own experiences. It was traumatic and happened a decade ago. It sticks with you. With how he is acting, he would be my ex super quick.",

I would say 90% of our relationship is good (we share interests, laugh, help one another, are kind) but when there is an issue it\u2019s really really bad. I have never experienced this before (I was married 8 years to a very wonderful man who always talked to me calmly and kindly - we never fought).  \n\nWhenever I get upset (which is rare) - I raise it (and sometimes I don\u2019t raise it the right way and could do better) but he always ends up angry with me, never acknowledges any wrongdoing and I end up feeling it is all my fault and spend days anxious, walking on eggshells trying to smooth things over.   He will bring up things from the past, tell me what I\u2019ve done wrong and why the problem is with me, borderline raise his voice at times, silent treatment and withhold affection.  It appears to be whenever I suggest he has done something wrong or that his behaviour is not ok. \n\nI am starting to question my own sanity. I\u2019m scared to say the wrong thing, is worried to talk about anything incase he turns it around on me later. \n\nI would never ever have tolerated this sort of behaviour from anyone before and I now it\u2019s not ok.

If you feel that your sense of self is being eroded, that you're constantly walking on eggshells, and that you're experiencing emotional manipulation and mistreatment, it could indeed indicate an abusive dynamic.\n\nLeaving an abusive relationship can be a difficult and complex process, and it's important to prioritize your safety and well-being. If you're considering leaving, it can be helpful to reach out to a professional, such as a therapist, counselor, or a local support organization specializing in domestic abuse. They can provide guidance, resources, and assistance in developing a safety plan.\n\nRemember that you deserve to be in a relationship where you feel valued, respected, and safe. It's crucial to surround yourself with a support network of friends, family, or professionals who can help you through this challenging time.\n\nI work with transitional living facilities and there are transitional houses that help people in abusive relationships.

This is so insightful. \nI have never experienced before and I really just thought it was me that was the issue. \nI\u2019ve never been in a relationship were someone is so combative and minor issues takes days to fix . Usually I would just raise, sit and have a mature (sometimes a difficult chat) and sort out the issue then and there. Never go to bed angry, never been made to cry from hurtful words or feel anxious at what is coming next. \nIn previous relationships I\u2019ve never felt insecure, worried about what mood he will be in or left feeling sad and needy because I\u2019m being ignored. I honestly thought it was something I was doing but it has only happened with this one person. \n\nYesterday when he said I was bipolar and a liar - I was so worried that our relationship was ending. I asked him (nicely) multiple times if he wanted to be with me - he refused to answer, would give other responses but ignore my question, he did this for nearly 10 hours and I was so anxious I took an anxiety pill to calm down. I couldn\u2019t understand why he couldn\u2019t just tell me, \u201cyes we are upset with one another but I do want to be with you\u201d. Even when upset I tell him I love him.",

They normalize small things to you. \"Oh, we just can't fight about \\[x\\] topic because he gets too triggered.\" And you let it slide because it's *just* one little thing. Everyone has flaws. But the abuser keeps slow dropping their mask. Keeps adding more and more little abusive things. Until one day you look back and you can't recognize yourself or how you got here. This is why anyone anywhere at anytime can be abused. Because abuse is like water working against rock. It slowly erodes pathways for itself over time, making a brand new rock formation. You only realize what's been happening long afterwords. There is nothing to be embarrassed about. All of us who have been abused have been in the same exact position.",

I would tread lightly and not accuse him of being narcissistic, as this will tip him off that you've figured him it and he will double down and manipulate you more/ make you feel worse until you are so confused that he keeps you from breaking up with him. I was stuck in this cycle for 10 years with a narcissist. They make you feel utterly crazy and question yourself by doing exactly what he's doing and using your deepest hurts against you. Don't be surprised if he comes back sweet as sugar and make you think he's sorry. He's not. No one says stuff like that if they are a decent person.",

He got angry with me and accused me of keeping secrets from him (well yeah, cause my mom made me promise to never tell anyone, ever).\n\nSo I was used to keeping my secret safe and he cornered me and demanded I talk to him about it.\n\nI wouldn't. It was my story that I would tell when I felt like it and not before. When I felt safe. So he was a POS and I got rid of him within 3 months.\n\nYour bf is being tyrannical and indeed punishing you for whatever, instead of showing you the compassion you deserve. His outsized anger is totally unreasonable.",

    "postText": "My wife (33f) and I (29m) have been married four years now, coming on five. We have generally had a good relationship and a good marriage.\n\nWe had a reasonably expensive wedding, which we're still paying for now. I get the bill every month to prove it. My wife took charge of planning the wedding, so it was to her tastes. She seemed to enjoy it at the time and for the first few years of our marriage, she would look back at the wedding with me happily and without issues.\n\nIn recent months I've noticed my wife's attitude to a) our wedding and b) our marriage itself shift. It began by her (I thought jokingly) referring to herself as my 'girlfriend'. She told me to buy her a 'girlfriend' card for Valentine's Day rather than a 'wife' one, for example. \n\nI thought she was just playing around at first. But this behaviour has only escalated. Two months ago my wife stopped wearing her wedding ring. I was understandably upset and asked her if there was something wrong. She told me everything was fine and she just 'doesn't the sensation of jewellery on her hands'. My wife has never liked rings and jewellery so this could be the case.\n\nBut when we are with friends, my wife will get upset if I talk about her as 'my wife' rather than just a girlfriend. She will go as far to interrupt me if I'm talking/telling a story to 'correct' me on our relationship. Initially, this was something our friends laughed at, but now everybody just finds it understandably awkward.\n\nOne of our friends was talking about their own wedding, which is scheduled for early next year. They asked for advice from my wife about how she'd planned ours and my wife responded with 'what wedding?'. When our friend continued talking about the table decorations my wife had used, my wife visibly teared up in front of the whole group and had to step outside.\n\nLater that evening, I asked her directly if she has a problem with our relationship or if I'm doing something wrong in our marriage. She assured me that everything is fine between us. From my perspective, outside of this issue, our relationship is as strong as ever. We are considering kids in the near future, our sex life is great, and my wife recently suggested we get matching tattoos as a renewal of our love.\n\nIs there advice anyone can offer on why my wife might be acting like this and what I should do?",

It could be as serious as a physical jssue, or means of coping with something that she did, either a concern with the cost of the wedding, or it could be postpartum to the wedding. Obviously this is a serious issue if she's completely denying it, but there are lots of women who spend so much time of their life planning \"the perfect wedding\" that when it's over, there's sometime anxiety and depression akin to what some athletes get when winning gold in the Olympics. It's over. That's it. You do it once and it's not happening again. Her approach to just simply denying it ever happened is odd, and there could be underlying issues to why, but it seems like she might be upset that the wedding and celebration is all over, and they're still paying for it. Either that or she cheated and has completely snapped and prefers to rather believe that she cheated on her boyfriend rather than her husband.",

Im not going to pretend like i know about brain tumors but my understanding was that she had a type of brain tumor that was easily removable but due to the position / location , it had some pretty serious symptoms like memory loss, loss of balance and some other weird stuff like what i described above. Ive talked to her since and she just said that she really doesnt remember the whole thing. In her mind, from beginning to end, from when she first started acting weird to the day she had the surgery done to remove the tumor, it was only like 1-2 weeks. Obviously, in reality it was over a year and a half, but she said thats how it is in her mind, about 2 weeks of being confused, then surgery, then back to her normal happy self. Kinda creepy that she has no recollection of almost an entire year out of her life. \n\nAn even creepier fact is that if you ask her about specific things that happened while she had the tumor, she **can** remember them, but if you ask her to bring up anything substantial on her own, she cant remember that entire year. For example \n\n\"What important event happened in August?\"  (My friends cousin graduated)\n\n...\"*I have no idea, what happened*?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbut if you ask her like this, she will remember: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Do you remember Joeys Graduation in August?\"\n\n\"*OMG yes the whole family went and Ruth almost fell down the stairs because it was raining\"* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe brain is a weirrrrdddd thing",

I'm so sorry to hear about your dad, dementia can be so difficult for everyone involved. How are you holding up? \n\nDementia is a sort of umbrella term for people whose cognitive functions are impaired in certain ways. The most common being Alzheimers, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia and Lewy bodies, I believe. You can even have a mix of several types.\n\nAs an example of the variations that occur: Lewy bodies sometimes comes with hallucinations and often people have Parkinson-like symptoms (shaking and slow movements), but it doesn't always start out with the symptoms we commonly know from Alzheimers like short-term memory issues and disorientation.\n\nIf you know which type your dad has, it might be beneficial to your understanding of him, though sometimes it's hard to tell for various reasons and so the term used will be \"dementia\" (at least where I'm from).\n\nIf there's anything you'd like to know about my work with people with dementia, I'd be happy to talk to you, if you feel it'll help you at all. I'm not by any means an expert, but I've been very close with people with various types and have helped soothe them and made them feel safe and I've taken care of their general needs. \n\nRegardless, tons of hugs from me to you \u2764\ufe0f",

My sweet friend (now deceased) had all of these psychological symptoms for about a year and a half before any of the physical symptoms of the disease began to plague her. I know that i am more worried about Huntington's than the average Redditor- but they should at least see a dr and have her checked out properly.",

Wife called in to say her husband was depressed and wanted him evaluated (like for a mental health issue). I come out and talk with him. He\u2019s in the bed and doesn\u2019t seem phased that a cop is in his bedroom asking what year it is. He had just stopped going to work and when I asked he said he didn\u2019t have work that day. It was a work day and definitely one he would be at work for. (EDIT wanted to add he was actually fired at this point because he had stopped coming going to work and never called them. They just assumed he didn\u2019t care. No one knew at that point of any medical problems.)\n\nI explain to the wife legally there\u2019s nothing I can do and direct her to the courts. They get the proper paperwork done I come back out later. This time he gets up out of bed and just casually walks to the bathroom to brush his teeth. It\u2019s about 4pm and he\u2019s just getting out of bed. \n\nAnyway I take him to the hospital and since I only happened to work that area that one day I couldn\u2019t ever go back by. Well a few months later I was bugged by it so I called the wife. She was so relieved I called because she didn\u2019t know how to reach me. Turned out the husband had stage 4 brain cancer which affected his logic and reasoning parts of his brain. They were on a track to get him the treatment he needed and his work was understanding of why his job performance was so low. They offered him back his work so he could get medical. \n\nHonestly one of the best things I\u2019ve been able to do to help someone and I still think about them often. It\u2019s scary and shows it can happen to anyone without any physical warnings.",

Make sure you mention exactly what is going on in the relationship, and if nothing is physically wrong then obviously see a psychiatrist and it's important you guys need to see one together.

I could tell that morning something wrong, nothing seemed to look right and everything was just off. At 10 AM, everyone knew something was really wrong when I looked at my 3 beautiful kids and asked them where their parents were. By 11 AM, the world as I knew it was gone and everything was jumbled. I could hear sounds, but words were mixed together and my head was pounding. Worst headache of my life, I'd rather give birth with no pain relief 20 times over than experiencing that pain again. And I was absolutely terrified. I thought I was going to die and I was scared as hell. Writing this brings back the emotional pain of that immense fear, and I broke down for a few minutes. That fear still affects me to this day...please, please, please be patient with her. Imagine knowing someone is a big part of your life but not being able to remember why, and everyone is telling you about things that you just don't remember. It's heartbreaking, frustrating and terrifying.\n\nI still to this day have some memory loss, I'm missing the 4 years before my stroke. (Side note: that's partially fine. I'm missing memories with my kids, but I had a POS boyfriend throughout those 4 years and not being able to remember him is a godsend.) I can remember bits and pieces, like if you ask me about the day the kids and I drove up to the mountains and then to the ocean, I can tell you in perfect detail. But if you ask me what happened in 2013, I can't tell you shit. I forget the names of things, especially when I get flustered. Once in a while, my hands just don't work right, and it's always fun to watch me try to catch a paintbrush or a coffee cup. It could have been far, far worse, and I'm grateful to have the few lasting effects that I do. I was lucky to have access to excellent medical care and we caught it fast. \n\nTake her to a neurologist, please. This sounds like a brain health issue more than a mental health issue. And hug her a little more and let her know you love her. It makes a world of difference. Good luck OP and OP's wife, I wish you guys nothing but the best scenario situation. \u2764\ufe0f",

It's possible she feels like she's now just a \"wife\" as opposed to being a sought-after person, ie. girlfriend, or someone planning the most exciting day of her life, a bride. Once the magic of being a bride wears off and you become a wife, it might lead to a slump for someone who didn't look past the wedding into the actual marriage. It feels like she might be depressed not to have something exciting in her life, and by denying it, she's trying to reclaim the past. \n\nEither way, a therapist is the way to go.",

I would schedule an appointment with a trusted physician to first rule out any physical injury or issue that could be causing this somewhat sudden onset of denial, and request scans of her head to rule out anything serious. If she\u2019s otherwise physically \u201chealthy\u201d then it\u2019s time to see a psychologist. \n\nEither way: I suggest you be gentle with her at the moment. I would avoid confronting her about this topic. The fact that she said, \u201cwhat wedding?\u201d and had teared up, leads me to believe there is something very serious happening to her -whether it\u2019s physical or mental - and in either case you are definitely not equipped to handle it. \n\nAnd if she is on the brink of some kind of emotional collapse? You don\u2019t want to be the one who pushes her over the edge by demanding answers or forcing her to look at photos of a wedding that she can\u2019t remember. \n\nAs someone who has personally experienced some very serious mental health problems that included a sudden loss of short term memory, I cannot tell you just how SCARY it is to feel betrayed by your own mind like that. Get her some help immediately. Good luck, OP.",

This was right at the end of their friendship.\n\nThe only good thing that came out of it is that the girl who did get the tattoo got a great tattoo from a great artist, and the artist got to make some money interacting with a cool client. And I guess she also made a break from a toxic \"friend\" and she's probably better off without that person anyway.\n\nI'm very very glad she went to him and not to someone who is terrible and unhygienic though. Like at least it's a nice tattoo. Could  be worse.",

Sometimes brain tumors cause this, sometimes mental illnesses arise, sometimes other medical conditions are arising. Maybe it's her quarter life crisis. I think you should do your best to express your concern but if she gets weirdly violent or starts crying uncontrollably/laughing uncontrollably, I'd call 911 to help you get her checked out. It's not a \"crazy person\" thing. That would cover that something is more medically wrong and she should go to a doctor (GP or...if she is comfortable, a Psy D) \n\nDo your best to ask lots of questions and not accuse her of anything. Use lots of \"I\" statements. \"Im concerned that you dont want to be my wife anymore. I feel very hurt when I am not referred as your husband because I take great pride in our relationship and I greatly cherish it.\"",

My wife and I at the time we're married for 10 years.\n\nFor me this feeling came out of nowhere, I love my wife dearly and wouldn't be able to live without her.\n\nAfter she let me run with it for a month or 3 in which I even moved out the house and moved in with my dad (Also something I said I'd never do) she finally got me to move back in and agree to testing at the neurology department.\n\nThis lead to a complete run down of everything in my head. And I'm afraid to say that it was the cause. I have been diagnosed with FTD (Frontal temporal dementia). This changed me in ways that my family and friend and even myself couldn't and still can't fathom.\n\nI'm not saying your wife has the same but it really all sounds horribly familiar.\n\nHave you ever explored medical options, even if just for yourself regarding your wife's behaviour?\n\nIf you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask \ud83d\ude0a",

Perhaps she associates \"wife\" with a frumpy old lady in an apron and \"girlfriend\" with a cool, pretty college girl partying and living her best life.\n\n- She has someone on the side and she's trying to distance herself from your relationship. Unlikely, as you say your relationship is good.\n\n- She has some mental problems. She might be losing memory, dissociating etc. \n\n- She might be anxious about the future of the relationship. Even if your relationship is good, maybe there's a problem with the amount/type of affection? Just because it seems stable and sex is good, doesn't mean it couldn't be better - maybe you speak a different love language? Or maybe, if that's not her first relationship, she has suffered heartbreak in the past and is now insecure?\n\nI think you should seek therapy - both couples' therapy and personal therapy for her.",

Often in cases of neurological disorders, the mind \"knows\" something is wrong, and will create narratives to explain discrepancies - confronting that your reality is flawed can be terrifying, especially when her mind might still have an underlying suspicion that something is \"off\". So, approach the topic gently, focus on simple facts, and do all you can to get her to a neurologist.",

If it's vague and confusing or if she gets emotional for seemingly no reason, it might be her mental health. \n\nShe might also miss the excitement of dating you? I know it sounds kinda dumb and if you guys have a good relationship I wouldn't see why, but everyone is different. Might also be an early midlife crisis and she's trying to go back to her \"younger days\" when you were just dating. In that case, I'd suggest light therapy. I hear your 30s are where life is usually the best, but of course society doesn't want you to know that.",

If your doctor us any good they will want to see her. \n\nYour doctor will know what medical conditions she has, medications your wife is on, will have an idea of other potential causes, And order tests and/or refer you to a specialist. \n\nDO NOT TAKE HER STRAIGHT TO A THERAPIST RULE OUT PHYSICAL CAUSES FIRST. \n\nEven then, I wouldn't push the point that you two are married for the time bring. I wouldn't necessarily play into the \"this is my girlfriend\" thing but I would try to keep things neutral until you know what is happening. \n\nThis is one of the most unusual posts I've ever seen.

I believed her and just said, \"I'm crazy.\" I knew what I as hearing wasn't there but I still couldn't get it out of my head.

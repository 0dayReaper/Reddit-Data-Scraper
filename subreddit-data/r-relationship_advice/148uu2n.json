    "postText": "We\u2019ve been together for 3 years now, I love him very much despite our hard times. He\u2019s going away Thursday-Friday for an overnight college orientation(we were supposed to hang out for those two days since we haven\u2019t in a while but he just found out about it.) we also graduated recently and this girl that he\u2019s friends with invited him to a celebration this Saturday at her place in front of me, so he\u2019s going to be there too. I\u2019m so upset that I\u2019m on the verge of tears and feel like avoiding him for a couple of days. I don\u2019t want to break up with him but I feel like I have to. (I\u2019m worried that he\u2019s going to cheat on me during both events happening this week) he told me he still wants to spend time together so he wants to make time for me Friday when he gets back and Saturday morning until he has to leave for the celebration. I can\u2019t let go of my feelings and I feel the need to push him away. Many of you will probably tell me to set my feelings aside because I\u2019m being unreasonable but I just can\u2019t. I don\u2019t know what to do. Any advice? Should I leave the relationship now?",

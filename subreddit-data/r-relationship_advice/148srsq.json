    "postText": "I 28 female , husband 30 male \n\nMy husband is such a great partner , he's loving and caring , kindhearted and all and i couldn't wish for a better husband.\n\n he embarrassed me infront of my family\n\nHere's how : my brother and my husband are best friends and they've been friends for like 14 years and they have this unbreakable friendship.\n\nI actually met my husband throughout my brother.\n\nThey get along well ... Too well .. like they have zero boundaries and limits between them.\n\nMy brother and my husband , gosh ... I'm just so frustrated to even say what they do lol.\n\nFor examples a week ago , we were watching a movie , me and my husband and brother \n\nAnd then my brother farted and when either of them farts , the other starts clapping \ud83d\udc4f and say way to go solider , you did great. \n\nEVERY SINGLE TIME , my husband or brother farts the other starts clapping and and says way to go solider you did great.\n\nThey're referring to the Fart as a solider , like the fart is a solider who made it out of their bum safely and successfully and they congratulate each other for the fart safe passage \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb. \n\n\nIt's so so so childish and stupid \n\nAnd even one time my husband farted and my brother didn't hear the fart and my husband was like hey bro yooooo you didn't hear what just happened?\n\nHere maybe you'll hear this one ... My husband farted again \n\nAnd my brother was like  yooooooo I'm sorry i didn't hear you the first time , it's been a while Dawg \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f welcome back Solider.\n\nIt makes me so ughhh \n\nI talked to my husband about it of course because I'm not going to tell brother to stop because he doesn't listen to me at all.\n\nAnd my husband said : i get it honey , it's just harmless fun between us , and we've been doing it for a long time long long time and it's kinda a habit between us now.\n\n\nI was okay with it and i said to my self whatever...\n\nUntill last weekend happened\n\nMy parents invited me to dinner and i went there with my husband\n\nI didn't talk to my husband about any kind of his habits with my brother because in my head i was like it's a damn family dinner with my parents and aunt and some of my cousins , they wouldn't do any childish behaviors around my parents and aunt and cousins.\n\n\nThey always did their weird behaviors just around me not my parents or any guests or whatever.\n\nSo i went there and the dinner was going great \n\nMy brother is 31 btw and my brother is just used to doing silly things around my parents and my parents know that he can be immature sometimes.\n\nSo my older brother farted ,  and i instantly gave my husband the side eye \ud83d\udc40 to let him know that he should keep his mouth shut and not even clap \ud83d\udc4f.\n\n\nAnd he didn't for a while untill my brother said , hey bro ... That's so disrespectful you know ... , You're not going to greet the solider for his amazing work.\n\nMy husband was ... Kinda cut in between me and my brother and he end up clapping and saying way to go solider \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb.\n \nand my husband returned the favor of course and farted.\n\nMy parents and aunt they were like , my cousins were laughing and looking at me like ...\n\nMy parents and aunt they laughed after to not make the situation more awkward than it was.\n\nIt's just frustrating you guys...... Am i overreacting?????\n\nMy husband doesn't do this kind of stuff around strangers or guests...\n\nAnd i was okay with it untill that thing happened with my family.\n\nWhat should i do ?? How can i prevent this from ever happening again. ? Help.",

I'm sure it is.\n\nBut it's also completely harmless, and as long as both your brother and your husband know how to behave themselves when they're not amongst family, I don't see what the problem is. \n\nAs dumb as it may be, I feel like you should be happy that your brother and your husband have maintained some of their boy-ish innocence from when they grew up together. It's nice when people do that, and it's nice that they both still feel comfortable engaging in their boy-ish ways when they feel comfortable, i.e. during family dinner.",

            "comment": "I don't think you can control how your husband acts when he's with your brother.  In fact, you shouldn't even try.  He was tight with your brother long before he met you, and they are going to do the things they like to do, exactly the way they have always done them.\n\nThe good news is, his behavior doesn't reflect badly on you in any way.  Your husband isn't your five-year-old (even if he sometimes acts like it LOL), and no one is going to criticize you for not teaching him better table manners.  It sounds like your parents and aunt didn't even notice or get the fart joke - they  just laughed because everyone else was laughing.  No one's dinner was spoiled, no one was seriously offended.\n\nSo yeah, IMO you are over-reacting.  I get that you probably want your relatives to think highly of your husband, and you're afraid this will make them think less of him.  But unless they also think less of your older brother, my guess is that your birth family regards both of them (fondly) as kids in grownup clothes, who still manage to enjoy silly pranks and potty-humor jokes whenever they get together.  You should do the same.",

            "comment": "&gt;Am i overreacting?????\n\nThough you have every right to feel mortified, yes. And as someone who's been told I have flagrant Peter Pan Syndrome, you made it a game and put yourself in the line of fire. There's nothing wrong with disliking it or feeling embarrassed, but no one forced you to put yourself between friends and a long standing tradition that didn't involve you beyond that they both feel safe doing it around you. While he clearly tried to keep to your wishes, that put him in a difficult position that could negatively affect his friendship. Your best two options are to either get over it or to talk to them at the same time, ideally without scolding them or otherwise treating them like children. If they're genuinely as capricious as appears, especially your brother, being overbearing may backfire. Certainly did with my sisters.",

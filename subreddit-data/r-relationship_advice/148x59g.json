    "postText": "There\u2019s mutual interest between us to me (23M) and her (25F). We are both public figures at a small TV station. I\u2019ve told her I\u2019m interested in dating. She said it\u2019s best we stay friends because of our work.\n\nWe hang out and travel around about twice a week and talk almost every day. On multiple occasions when she\u2019s been drunk, she\u2019s been really flirty (in public places too). She got upset when I didn\u2019t show affection back. When sober, she\u2019s appreciative of me protecting her in those situations l. I confronted her about it the first time and she agreed to stop. She did it again.\n\nWe can hang out when sober just fine. Idk if this is a huge red flag. She hasn\u2019t been in many relationships before. She was college athlete at a good school. Should I move on? What would you do in my scenario?",

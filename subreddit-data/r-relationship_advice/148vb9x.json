    "postText": "My boyfriend, knowing that I\u2019m insecure, will think it makes me happy when he tells me that my boobs look bigger at times, but I\u2019d rather that he just compliments them how they are regardless of that, even as small as they are. If they seem bigger it might just be hormonal, but that comes and goes and I would still consider them small, even while at their biggest. I\u2019m probably between an A-B cup. \n\nAnytime he says this, it just makes me kind of upset but, I feel like I\u2019d like it more if he just appreciated them for being how they just normally are, even if small. You can describe breasts in other words than size too, the way they look, or feel! Has anyone else been in this situation and how did you deal or respond to comments like this?\n\nOtherwise he still tells me they\u2019re perfect, and he loves them but it just triggers me that the only characteristic of them that he can compliment at times is how they may seem bigger than usual..\n\nTLDR: I\u2019m insecure about my small breasts and my boyfriend thinks he is complimenting me when he says at times that they seem bigger, but in reality they are still just as small",

Though if he\u2019s telling you they are perfect and he loves them is this after you ask or at other times? Bc just take his word for it. He might be a butt guy and truly not care what size they are. \n\nBut yeah they should swell some around your periods. Just fyi. Lol",

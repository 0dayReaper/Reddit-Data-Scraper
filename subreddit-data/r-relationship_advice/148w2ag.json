    "postText": "This is my first time posting on here so bare with me. My bf (27m) and I (22f) have been together since October 2021. In that time I've probably gained 50lbs which I've lately been losing through diet and exercise. I went off my ADHD meds so the weight gain was sudden, I am currently down 20lbs.\nSoon after, my bf stopped being sexually interested in me. 3 months into having no sex I brought it up to my boyfriend and asked him if he was still attracted to me. He told me he was and that work was stressful. I also work a stressful job so I try to be understanding. 4 months, I bring it up again and it causes a fight and I end up apologizing. Then comes month 5 1/2, I'm on his tablet and I find lesbian foot porn in his history. I broke down crying, even though he's been telling me he doesn't have a sex drive he's looking at and jerking off to other women while I'm wondering why I'm not enough to be touched. I break up with him because I couldn't take it anymore I needed to feel wanted. He told me not to look in his history if I don't like it. Soon he begs for me back and by the 6th month mark I get back with him. At this point I'm ready to stop bringing up sex. The issue is I really do love this guy with all my heart and he's the only one I really want. I just wonder if I'm a fool for feeling this way, I'm sacrificing my needs for someone that won't fulfill them. At this point I feel awkward being naked around him, like he won't even appreciate it, I get dressed in the bathroom. About 2 weeks go by and one night he starts touching me and says he wants me, he got hard but once our clothes came off he said he was too tired. This has happened many times throughout these last 6 months, twice causing me to go for a walk and cry and feel ugly. The next morning, he insists he wants me and we have the lowest energy sex we've ever had, neither of us got there. I don't know how I'm supposed to feel now, is our sex life over? Should I even stay if I'm just staying for a friend and not a lover? He tells me he loves me everyday and we do fun things together, he says he's not asexual either. I feel bad and dirty for wanting sex so bad, and sometimes I think I'm becoming way too insecure about it. But everyday he tells me how much he loves me, cuddles me, etc. I'm so confused. May I add, since the last time we had \"sex\" I haven't brought up a thing to him and he has no idea how hurt this makes me. He thinks I'm completely content with how things are, but I can't bring it up without him getting defensive or upset.",

            "comment": "Unfortunately, in relationships, once you let yourself go, your partner will lose interest. Even if you kept attractive, if sex becomes repetitive and boring, that kills it too.\n\nEven if you got that covered, once you stay stagnant and become fixed, unchanging, predictable, boring, that will do it as well.\n\nEven if you look physically like before, you will then need to conquer the rest of these.\n\nWhen you see the same person every day, unless you are met with someone who's always changing, always growing, never the same like yesterday, inspiring, keep them on their toes in every area from physical to mental to emotional, this will happen.\n\nI realize that your specific thing is your physical attractiveness but like I said, you could have looked the same physically but if you fell behind anywhere else I just listed, same results.\n\nYou can let this get to you if you want, but we all face this.\n\nThat's why you'll see the most beautiful woman in the world eventually getting divorced or husband cheating.\n\nShe stopped growing and became boring",

    "postText": "Don\u2019t know how to post a link to my original post. You can find it on my profile.\n\nFirst of all, thanks to everyone. While there were some rather unpleasant responses (like the guy who called me a pussy for being upset or the woman who messaged me to say that if I couldn\u2019t satisfy my girlfriend I should let better men do so because she deserved it) the overwhelming majority were kind and sympathetic. I couldn\u2019t respond to most because there were so many but I assure you, you are appreciated.\n\nI talked to my landlord who was sympathetic and offered me another apartment if I continued paying my lease. It\u2019s an informal arrangement where I\u2019m still legally residing and paying for my old apartment but staying in another. \n\nAs expected, my now former friends took my old roommates side and I\u2019ve cut them out of my life. \n\nI\u2019m not doing the best I could be mentally. I\u2019m all alone and dealing with personal insecurities, loneliness and heartbreak. Still, at least I\u2019m out of my earlier situation. I\u2019ve taken a week off work and arranged to see a therapist. \n\nAll in all, my situation isn\u2019t great but it\u2019s unlikely to get worse and I\u2019m working on improving it.\n\nEDIT: I have been completely overwhelmed by the response to this. I have literally hundreds of messages of support and lots of comments urging me to stay strong. There is no possible way I can respond to all of them so I just wanted to say thank you to everyone. You\u2019re all amazing!",

Im more gspot than clit oriented and smaller penises hit the gspot better and are easier and more enjoyable to do oral on. On the flip side, I don't expect orgasm every time I have sex with my boyfriend, it boosts my self esteem and makes me feel appreciated in itself, I'm just happy to satisfy him and the time and effort it would take to achieve orgasm without a self esteem killing (for him) vibrator would kill the mood. But I am perfectly happy and would never cheat because he doesn't make me orgasm every time. Even when I don't, the act of sex satisfies me physically too. That's just shit people using shit excuses. If I had to choose a partner strictly on their penis size I would never pick a big one. And dad bods YES. Every emotionally abuse relationship I've been in has been associated with hung ripped guys and now those aspects are a turn off. Is that wierd? \n Anyway, I'm glad op is focusing on himself, he deserves better than someone who'd hook up w the roomies! Deserves way better.",

Grinding is nice sometimes, but they've got to use some variety!\n\nTo u/ThrowRAcheater1 : I've had my share, and maybe some other people's share, of dicks, and some of the best times I've had with men were with those who had small dicks. They knew how to use their bodies in ways that I still remember, 20+ years later. The kissing, the hands, the fingers, their tongue skills ... oh my. I've spent about 2 decades now with the love of my life, who surprised me by not only being a man (I switch teams but lean towards ladies), but also by having a large member AND being nicely skilled in other areas. He's a unicorn, by far NOT the norm (truthfully, sometimes I wish he were smaller, as blowies are a lot more fun on smaller dicks). Focus on other sexytime skills and you'll be cherished. \n\nHopefully this isn't too crass because of your presumably young age, I just want to impress that a dick is merely one thing in PiV sex. You sound like such a caring man, I hope you can get more comfortable being by yourself, and gain more confidence in the bedroom. I hate that the 2 people you trusted the most turned out to be such shitbags. I'd take you out for coffee if you lived nearby.\n\n\nEDIT: A Helpful award? I didn't even know that was a thing! Thank you so much, u/Maeble ! Have a lovely day!",

The betrayal issue might stay for a while longer, but a therapist will help incredibly much dealing with that. \n\nRegarding feeling alone, well... Part of it is reaching out. To enjoy yourself by doing what you like and looking up events related to your interests. \n\nGive it a year or two and you'll come out of this stronger, with each day getting a little bit better, but hard days in between. You just have to remember to stay strong brother and not let the bad days drag your process to a halt. You may get depressed, but no matter what happens, get up in the mornings. \n\nAnd I'd suggest having something simple but healthy for breakfast, like oatmeal. Breakfasts will make it easier to withstand the bad days. Exercise as well, even if it's just a short walk, but if you can, go to any of the exercise subreddits for ideas, like /r/bodyweightfitness. They have decent plans for workouts without equipment. /r/breakfast has some pretty good things as well regarding what to eat. \n\nAnd seriously, I can't stress enough how good these 2 things are for you in general, and especially if you get depressed, which is also likely to happen in your situation, but you also seem to be pretty strong, strong enough to ask for help, not here, but to ask a therapist. It requires strength to ask for any kind of help. \n\nAnd that's why I think you'll be able to get through this better than before.",

When we met one of the dudes from my friend group who I wasn't close to but had recently gotten out of a divorce apparently had a crush on her. I tried to get him to talk to her but he was being too much of a chicken about it. I had a thing for her too and told him to man up or else I'd go talk to her. He didn't and I did and we started dating. Apparently this led to my friend group picking sides as to who she should be with, and by choosing sides I mean pushing for him to get with her.\n\nLong story short the day we got officially together and it was my first relationship ever my friend told me that she had been telling my friends that I had been manipulating her, coercing her into things, and that she was scared of me. It was some really fucked up shit since I really try my best to not push any boundaries out of fear of this type of thing. My friends knew that was always my issue and I'd known them for 12+ years.\n\nWell apparently she had been saying these things so that she could be hooking up with the divorced guy and have the approval of the friend group. My friend who told me didn't know about it until they told him and he went straight to me to find out if it was true (he was a bro and remains a bro). I showed him our text messages and snapchats where she was the one pushing for things and taking me out. How she surprised me on my birthday not 2 weeks before and planned a whole day for us. I tried talking to my \"friends\" trying to prove my innocence. Only one person bothered to take a look and he was like \"oh well she's with him now\". \n\nThis led to me moving hours away to get away from it. My anxiety was the highest it's ever been and my trust issues were crazy. A few more shitty situations happened soon after. But then it hit me that I had experienced the worst case scenarios and I was still okay. I was able to recover, found new amazing friends, worked through more of my issues, and felt happy. I started to flourish in my craft that I threw myself in. I'm now currently the happiest I've ever been and surrounded by the best people.\n\n**the TLDR of this is I experienced something similar and that led to me growing. This bad event allowed me to leave people who didn't care about me and find people who do. Bad things can lead to some amazing scenarios if you choose to grow instead.**",

My then SO who we will call John ( not his real name) was cheating with another person in our friendship group ( not a roommate but close to the same thing). When I chose to end the relationship bc I found out, they all supported the other two and not me. It was incredibly painful at the time but moved me forward to better things. That took a while though. \n\nI reconnected with friends who were really my friends and had been worried about me. I developed some wonderful supportive relationships that are still in my life today. I learned to take care of myself better and set more effective boundaries with others. I moved on to find the love of my life. I built a happier life than I had before. \n\nOver the years every one of those former friends has called me up and asked to \" do lunch\" . Each time they have basically said that they were sorry for treating me badly and they knew that John would never have a healthy relationship \" because he was John \".  \n\nAnd John? He cheated on every relationship he has had. \n\n Living well is really the best revenge. \n\nThere is a song recorded by Johnny Cash called \"Cry,Cry,Cry\" . Marty Stuart did a cover of it in the late 80s / early 90s which I believe is even better. It's on UTube. Sometimes music helps too. \n\nStay strong and build a better life for yourself.",

I also recommend that you block your exes (gf and friends) so that you don't have to see their garbage on SM. Your therapist can give you pointers on striking up new friendships, but only when you're ready. If you have a hobby or interest, now is the time to dive into it. Physical exercises can help with your mental exercises, too. You don't have to go all out at a gym, especially if you can't afford a gym membership (not saying you can't - just covering my bases), but taking a walk, jogging, or something else that doesn't cost money can help you process. When I lost someone important to me, I made sure to get some workouts in here and there so I wouldn't drown in grief. And trust me, I am not in shape. At all. But it helped.\n\nAlso, learn to love yourself before you attempt to love anyone else. Don't dwell on your shortcomings (real or perceived), but focus on your strengths. And figure out how to turn your weaknesses into strengths. And look, I don't care what kind of person you are - ONLY SHIT PEOPLE TREAT YOU LIKE SHIT. You did not deserve that level of betrayal and then to have the friends turn on you like that. They are all trash, and now that you have pulled yourself out of that dumpster you will finally see it. Meanwhile, let them all rot together. It won't happen tomorrow and probably not even a year from now, but some day, they will definitely reap what they sow. And you'll thank God that you got out of there.\n\nEdited for grammar.",

Landlord was cool and told me she was going to pursue him and him only for the cost to clean because I had been a good tenant. \n\nHe ended up knocking up my ex a few months later. I literally had a calendar entry for 10 months from my last sexual encounter with my ex... after that.. I knew I was clear. Only follow up I ever had with her was a random live journal comment she made years later that I only saw a few years afterwards apologizing for what She did and how it impacted me. They had 3 kids and a miserable marriage that  crapped out. She was miserable herself and never did anything with her own career. He became a drunk. \n\nMy life was much better not having her in it.

These can be used as teaching moments. In a real life forum when someone says something this patently absurd, we wouldn't simply let it go. We'd call that person out for such a bizarre, ignorant take. If we normalized this kind of response instead of hiding the names, perhaps we can start to chip away at the toxicity that lurks beneath the surface level of social media.\n\nJust my two cents though.

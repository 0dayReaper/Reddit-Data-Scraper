    "postText": "\nMy boyfriend and I are very fit, and I can honestly say, we are both very attractive. I do have some insecurities of course, and I tend to struggle with self confidence. Taking care of myself physically has helped tremendously with my confidence and I try hard to not care what people think. My boyfriend and I have great sex and I feel sexy when I\u2019m with him. But I tend to back away from stuff like dancing and maybe doing more \u201csexy\u201d things for/ with him. I can\u2019t do anything \u201csexy\u201d without laughing and being awkward lol. He is my best friend, I can always be myself around him but I do struggle with this certain topic pretty hard. I feel like I\u2019m a \u201ccloseted freak\u201d if that makes sense haha. I just don\u2019t have a sexy personality, I joke around more. Help I wanna be sexy lol!",

Some guys are into it, good for them, they're keeping food on the table for dancers. Some women feel sexy doing it. Good for them, they make said men happy.\n\nI think all stripping teasing looks ridiculous! Female strip teasing, males strip teasing, senior citizen strip teasing, none of it is sexy to me in the slightest, and a room full of solitary dudes standing there staring at women on a stage stripping creeps me out. I can only imagine how the dancers must feel.\n\nMy first serious girlfriend in college tried to do one for me and couldn't stop laughing the whole time. I should say half time, because I stopped her halfway through. The previous year I had been to my first strip club when I was pledging a frat and discovered that it was not for me. As Ron Swanson said, \u201cI get the feeling that every one of these women is running a low-grade fever.\u201d I told my girlfriend that and she was beyond relieved. (We still probably broke a few indecency laws in bed that night, and the next day I bought her a pair of coveralls as a thank you, but that's neither here nor there.)\n\nI've found that this is true of any other \"act of sexiness\" that you can think of. Walking into the room in $500 of stuff you bought at Vicky's Seekit? If that makes you feel sexy or bonerizes your man, good for you. But not all women love wearing lingerie, and not all men are particularly turned on by it either.\n\nThe only thing that should be universally sexy is sex itself, and not even that is strictly the case! Stop feeling bad because something that TV and cinema portrays as universally sexy isn't sexy to you. If you need assurance that there are men out there that would rather see you come out of the bathroom wet and wrapped in a towel or lying on the couch wearing your reading glasses reading Dune, rather than doing a dance while slowly removing your Uggs and Dungarees and football jersey, I'm here to give it to you and there are millions of men behind me ready to agree.",

If it's anxiety and you do think you would enjoy it if the anxiety giggles were gone, I say go ahead and do it a couple of times and see if the giggles go away, or at least start going away quickly enough. It's classic exposure therapy.\n\nI'm saying this because I want to emphasize that I don't want to shame anybody that is into stripping or whatever, which I think my comment did do. My real point was that nobody should feel any guilt for not wanting to do something that TV, movies, porn, and the internet tell them they should want to do.\n\nIf you think you would enjoy it if you can get past the giggles, I say do it. It's never bad for one's self-esteem to a have small victory against anxiety/fear. Otherwise, go sit next to him while he's on the couch, put your feet in his lap, and tell him to be a good boy and take your socks off... slowly. Nothin' wrong with that. No ma'am, no sir, no how.",

Maybe start with straddling him and slowly taking off your clothes, do little things like moving his hand somewhere, tease him occasionally. You can even tell him to do certain things or kiss you certain places. What helps me especially with this is to whisper it, so there\u2019s no direct eye contact in case that makes you nervous. Just start with adding little things, and you\u2019ll eventually build your confidence to do the bigger things. What also helps is being just a bit tipsy (makes you brave but not quite to the point of drunk) and low lighting to get into it. You\u2019ll find your groove in time. His reactions to these things (if positive) will also really help make you feel more comfortable. Go at your own pace. It\u2019s difficult at first but it\u2019s good to remember that you\u2019re with someone you trust. Best of luck!",

I was in a similar situation to OP (25f, athletic build/healthy weight but still struggling with body confidence because that shit effects everyone\u2026)\n\nTo add though, I followed some accounts on TikTok (Ik Ik\u2026) where people show you little routines you can build up to doing. Feeling like I have a plan and I don\u2019t need to wing it helps me feel less daft. There\u2019s a lot of good creators out there that help with this specific issue of wanting to do something but not sure what or how to do it without looking awkward. \n\nI also psyched myself up for a boudoir shoot last year and 100% recommend it. It helped with my confidence but also in seeing myself in a sexy way (as well as a different gift for my fianc\u00e9/partner of 8 years\u2026). My body confidence has skyrocketed from a mere 2 hour shoot with a professional. Totally worth looking into even if you just keep the photos to yourself!",

I'll be honest we laugh at eachother at even our most intimate of times.  I enjoy my wife so much more because she isn't putting on these performances and attracting others.  That sort of peacocking is mainly useful for attracting quick partners that are gone as quickly as they showed up.  It doesn't seem like your in need of new opportunities at the moment.  ( not trying to sound judgmental,   just want you to have the confidence in yourself based on yours and your partners satisfaction that you are enough)",

What has helped me is finding something to ease into sexy performances since you yourself are already sexy you are just doing a enhanced performance. So maybe some whine, whiskey, bud whatever and just jamming and chilling to music casually first and then when your ready and loose play 1 song that both can slow dance to and then switch to a throw down song that he can be seated for. \n\nI also suggest a game at dinner it can help turn competitive teasing and joking into a little more dirty tease and suggestions.",

I don't know what outfits do it for your guy. But a tight shirt with a short skirt and nothing on under that. Then just doing normal thing but exaggerating them. Like bending over more than needed to put dishes away and kid of pretending you are having trouble so you stay bent over for a second or two longer than normal. Just teasing like that was very sexy to me. You guys are into working out you said. If you go to a public gym and do exercises that would make him think of sex. But no one else would be the wiser. Only he and you would know. That might embarrass him a bit if he's unable to stand up because you being too sexy . If you know what I mean. No need to dance. There are plenty of other ways to be sexy.  Don't feel bad about not being able to dance sexy either. Just think how goofy your guy would look if he tries dancing sexy for you. Lol.

But I also think you are alluding to feeling like this is some inauthentic performance for his pleasure. Ironically this will be sexy for him, if you are doing something that turns YOU on (even if the act mainly turns you on but you see how it turns them on) and it will be more natural and authentic because you aren\u2019t performing the concept of \u201csexy lady doing striptease.\u201d How would you tease him/interact with him if you were doing it for your own pleasure? If you aren\u2019t sure then you have some work to do to figure it out. \n\nA tool to help me learn that which has changed my life was the \u201c3 minute game\u201d You take take turns asking to touch/play with your partner for your own pleasure for 3 minutes, then asking them to touch/play with you for 3 minutes in a way that would b pleasurable(with partner\u2019s consent and potentially negotiating something else if that act is a no). Then you take turns. It\u2019s an amazing tool to practice understanding what you want, negotiating/asking for it, saying no to what you don\u2019t want.\n\nRemember giving for your pleasure, giving for his pleasure, receiving for your pleasure, and receiving for his pleasure are 4 separate things and the most satisfying sex happens when both partners get plenty of all of them. \n\nAlso, laughing doesn\u2019t ruin anything don\u2019t sweat it.",

You don't need those qualities to validate what you have with him. You're already having a great time and he as well. So just go on. You're already very sexy for him.",

            "comment": "Girl SAME!! I CANNOT dance when I think any other human being might see me, including my amazing partner who has seen me in every position/movement during sex and calls me his \"goddess\" literally every day. But here's the thing - it's not about our partners, it's about US feeling sexy as individuals. You said you can be yourself and that's the thing, you don't see YOURSELF as a sexy individual independent of actual sex. So here's some things I've been doing that help me:\n\nSex toys and masturbation (porn free for this specific exercise). Just feeling your body and what feels good and sensual without a partner reminds you you're a sexual entity on your own, plus all the benefits of masturbation including increased self esteem. Toys are just fun and remind you you're a sexy person worth having sexy things lol.\n\nTake nudes/sexy pics! Keep them in a locked folder on your phone or just delete them, the point is to literally see yourself as sexy. You can send them if you want, but again, this is for you. I've followed some boudoir accounts on insta and TikTok that show you how to take easy at home sexy shots from different angles for all body types and comfort levels. They're great for getting creative and finding the most flatting poses.\n\nMove your body in a nonsexual way. Yoga's a good one, especially with sensual music. Personally, I'm about to get some of those Chinese silk fans off Etsy and practice with them in my room and backyard - the movements are really flowy and sensual, but more importantly, the idea of doing it makes me happy, not scared someone might see. Find SOME kind of movement that gives you that joy and get in the habit of just doing it, again, just for you.\n\nOnce we start seeing ourselves as sensual, sexual beings, being that with and for our partners will come so much easier and more natural. As always, give yourself grace for the journey there and have fun!!",

My husband and I have been together since our teens (21 years) and learned everything about sex together. The biggest thing we learned was not to take it too seriously. SEX IS FUN! If your personality is more fun and playful than sex kitten, work with that instead. I think once you take the pressure off yourself to \u201cbe sexy\u201d you\u2019ll relax and find that you already ARE sexy. \n\nThings you can try to relax more: \n\nRead really hot sex scenes right before. Either from a romance/erotica book your reading or a site like Literotica. It\u2019ll get your mind more in the zone. \n\nSet the mood in the room. Music, lighting, candles, etc. Then dance WITH your boyfriend. Start with a slow dance to your favorite slow song and go from there. \n\nPlay around with different types of sex. Maybe you\u2019d feel better if he was in charge and telling you what to do? Maybe you\u2019d feel better if you were in the one calling the shots? Bondage? Tantric sex? The options are endless! Try some new stuff out. You may find something that makes your brain fuzz out and make you turn into the little sex kitten you\u2019re dreaming of being \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Or y\u2019all might just have fun and have a few laughs and mark stuff off your Sex Bucket List.",

The two of you in a sense have grown up together. The pressures of adulthood are huge, especially if you see his attraction to other women you believe are more attractive and Sexier than you think you are. You've been together long enough to be able to communicate your feelings and insecurities to each other without judgment. Just be honest with him.\n\nMy wife (43) buys lingerie that she thinks is sexy, but lingerie doesn't turn me on, I get turned on by little things, like a sideways glance, a booty shake, hell,  even a simple touch. I tell her this often, but she still buys the uncomfortable lingerie that is difficult to remove, we both have our insecurities,  her previous marriage was emotionally abusive which hurt her self-confidence,  mine was the same, it took me years on my own to gain a modicum of self-respect and confidence although I know I am attractive by the way women look at me. You'd think dating many women after my divorce would increase my self-confidence,  but it didn't,  what helped was therapy, someone helping me see what I couldn't, gave me a new perspective. \n\nTalking with him will help you understand what he wants from you. Maybe the way you are is what he wants, maybe not, but you won't know unless you communicate. \n\nGood luck",

She is the part of me that I apparently had deep down, but is suppressed.\nAll of that to say think of behaviors and attitudes you would want to try, incorporate them one at a time, and give yourself a different name / identity / alias. Beyonc\u00e9 has Sasha Fierce. What is your alias?",

Is there anything he could do better to help?\n\nAnd i want to echo the other comments\u2019 sentiment that you have to find your own sexy. If dancing doesn\u2019t work, don\u2019t do that as what\u2019s sexy. Personally, i never understood how movies portray women slowly undressing as what\u2019s sexy. I could never. \n\nMy personal \u201csexy\u201d is dressing in lingerie and curling up next to him, tracing his body w my nails as we talk about life. \n\nAlso, some \u201csexy\u201d things can be goofy and silly too! For example, I went to the store with him in a short dress and no panties.",

    "postText": "My girlfriend of 4 years and I are both in our early-30s. Her salary: $130k, mine: $190k. We split 50/50 for rent, groceries, and usually any expenses over $30 \u2013 I usually cover it and she pays me back on Venmo. I pay utilities. Usually we split dinner too but every few weeks I'll get the cheque.From what she has told me a while back, she probably has $50k of student loan debt remaining \u2013 I have 0.\n\nI loaned her $25k to help her pay her student loan quicker [edit: which I told her she can pay back after paying off her loans]. She was reluctant to take it to begin with, worried that I would hold it over her, but eventually took it. But then she also persistently owes me anywhere from $1k to $10k in expenses we split (Venmo transactions) \u2013 which is where I do become critical. Finances is a very sensitive topic for her and she's not open at all about it \u2013 I guess out of shame from student loans (as a non-American I don't fully understand it given how common it is in the US, to be honest).\n\nEvery time I try approach it, things get tense very quickly and insists she will pay me back.I usually have to send the Venmo request and I often (though not always) have to remind her to pay them. This includes even for an airbnb she organized for a bachelorette (but too was much for her card). Even despite her friends paying her back \u2013 she still hasn't paid it off Venmo. She says she used it to pay it off other expenses, but that she will pay it all back. She eventually does (though sometimes 6 months later).\n\nI'm mostly tired of having to remind her, and then her being offended by \"the way I ask for it\", getting defensive, saying that I don't trust her. She's a good person \u2013 sensitive, earnest, with bad anxiety. I don't think she's dishonest, but she doesn't have any of the financial discipline or urgency that I have when it comes to paying back people. She only lets it dictate her lifestyle so much \u2013 as if she's complacent to pay loans for her whole life.\n\nI've communicated my frustrations, that it stresses me out that I feel like I have to ensure I get it back, that her passive way of paying me back doesn't signal her sense of accountability.I'm worried that as long as she has student loans, there\u2019ll also be a rolling amount of expenses that she owes me for, that would get out of hand if I didn't manage it. She says if we were to get married, that she would still own her student loan debt \u2013 but it's hard to imagine how that wouldn't affect any life decision we make.\n\nWhat do you think \u2013 does it sound like I should just break up with her? Or given her financial situation, am I lacking empathy and being a rigid landlord ?",

If you plan a future together you need to be on the same page. The couples I know who are planning a dirtier together work as a team. They help each other as much as they can and without keeping score and sending Venmo requests. Right now you sound like roommates more that life partners. I do think your GF needs to get a grip on her finances so maybe it would help if you suggested she see a financial planner, or see one together to come up with a financial plan you blithe agree on moving forward. If none of this appeals to you then maybe your views on money are so different that it\u2019s best to move on.",

            "comment": "Most people who have student loans have no real understanding of how the loans are serviced, how the interest accrues, now much interest they will pay over the life of the loan if they pay only the minimum, how damaging deferring payments is, and how beneficial paying early is - or that you likely have to inform the bank &amp; request that overpayment be applied to the principal. US banks take horrible advantage of the young people who blithely take out loans for college. (It\u2019s criminal, imho, but that\u2019s another story.)\n\nIt sounds like your gf makes a good salary &amp; should be able to pay her student loans off fairly quickly depending on the cost of living in your city.\n\nIt also sounds like your gf is a little financially irresponsible, but I wonder if this isn\u2019t a product of not really understanding her finances. Most Americans don\u2019t have a firm grasp on their monthly budget &amp; spending, or a sense of what they can afford or how much they should save. Basic budgeting isn\u2019t taught in school, and everyone is meant to just figure it out on their own. This isn\u2019t a great practice. \n\nYou might encourage your gf to meet with a financial planner, or barring that, to track her spending to the penny for a period of three or so months so she can get a sense of where her money is going &amp; can develop a budget. It sounds as though she is regularly living beyond her means, and she probably doesn\u2019t really know where her money is going or how she can cut back.\n\nOf course, this is a sensitive subject, and you need to approach her with sensitivity rather than shaming her or being punitive.\n\nIf she\u2019s unwilling to attempt to get a handle on her finances, she may not be the girl for you, but I think you need to give her the opportunity to right her ship.\n\nIn the meantime, stop loaning her money. Full stop. \n\nIn terms of the $25k loan she is repaying, behave as though you were the bank, and send her the Venmo request every month - just like a bill. Just decide that she needs that tickler every month &amp; stop resenting her for that. It\u2019ll be one less thing that bothers you.",

Her salary seems good, but maybe your expenses are too high for her, or she actually has more expenses than you think she does. You\u2019re also concerned that she has student loans, but she has loans, period. From how you describe your lifestyle, it sounds like she will always have loans. Why is a 25k student loan the thing hanging above your head when she regularly owes you thousands as well? Personally, I imagine she could easily have personal loans or credit card loans as well. \n\nI\u2019m not the most financially strict person (and I\u2019m forgetful with dates) but i hate not having money so im never in debt. I have a brother who is perpetually in debt. The attitude is completely different, and he seems to think it will always work out (and to his credit, it sort of does). I think you and your girlfriend will both be unhappy with your incompatibilities. Just smile, try to recoup as much money as possible (make up an excuse if you have to) and accept some losses, and break up with her.",

She should be able to ask you to not remind about the monthlies (if that\u2019s what she needs) you should be able to ask for a more foolproof way of resolving the monthly bills.\n\nI would say, consider writing off the 25k in your head. You may never get it back.\n\nThen maybe agree to settle venmo on the first of the month?",

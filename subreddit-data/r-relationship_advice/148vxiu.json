    "postText": "I kept telling her not to generalize an entire group of people based on just one news article but she kept talking over me. She ended up getting quite hysterical telling me how 'foreigners' are all dangerous people coming from 'unsafe' countries. I told her what about the Indian guy she dated and she said 'he was here for good reasons, the foreigners coming in now are being sent here by the elites to depopulate us' \n\nIt's really kind of jarring to me because it wasn't until today she said anything remotely racist but I've been noticing her getting more and more unhinged lately and I don't know what is causing it. She spends most of her time watching YouTube videos on her phone and listening to streams.",

I just dealt w this w my nephew. Indiscriminate use of the n-word. When I challenged him, he did what all racists do - \"well if you look at the dictionary definition it just means ignorance..\" I said I dont ever hear you use that word referring to anyone but black people. He was asked what his black friend would think about him saying it and he said he doesn't know. I tried to impress upon him that the word causes hurt, you're aware of that - but don't give a shit? What does that say about you? I try my best not to do things that I know will cause people hurt. If you don't - you seem like a bad person to me.\n\nThe only thing you can do is keep asking questions about their worldview and ask how'd they would like to be treated like that - I find people don't actually think about the hurt they inflict until they experience it personally.",

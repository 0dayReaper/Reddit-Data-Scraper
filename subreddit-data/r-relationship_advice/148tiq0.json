    "postText": "I\u2019m embarrassed that I miss my ex and want to unblock him even though I\u2019m so happy I finally was able to get myself to end the relationship\u2026 He made my life hell during our break up (sending me verbally abusive texts, clearly stating his intention was to make me feel as low as he felt, refusing to give me money he owed me for his plane ticket for our recent vacation, refusing to return my apartment key unless I subjected myself to the verbal abuse). I\u2019m getting so upset even recounting these things\u2026 I blocked him on every single app after he clearly stated his intention was to make me feel terrible, but unblocked him momentarily after I got his dad to get him to put my apartment key outside for me, just to send him a message wishing him well and asking him to keep a polite distance if we ever saw each other. (For my own closure you know?)\n\nHe sent me emails that night and the next day asking me to unblock him so that he could call and apologize and not leave things off on such a bad note. The entire reason I began wanting to break up with him over six months ago was because of his issues with emotional self regulation, though, and I don\u2019t really think he\u2019ll give me the apology I want (or the hundreds of dollars he still owes me of course\u2026) But, I still find myself thinking about unblocking him constantly, and wanting that phone call. But I\u2019m too embarrassed to tell my friends that, or myself, because of how awfully mean he was. So I\u2019m here to ask strangers for their advice on what feels like the healthiest thing to do! Thanks so much for your thoughts and time \u2764\ufe0f",

In fact, you should block his email address as well so he can't contact you that way anymore either. \n\nCall up a friend and just spend some time with them instead.

So you stick around to make sure that you get the 'high'. This is part of the reason these relationships are so easy to become enmeshed with that person - you're not getting a constant source of love and attention, and the highs produce serotonin in your brain so when you're in a 'low' you're wanting that rush of serotonin again. He left you in a \"low\" and it's very easy for your brain to crave that rush of love again. \n\nI implore you to look up and research \"surviving narcissistic abuse\" and try and break down the physiological (and physiological) reasons why you want to unblock him. I think maybe then you will feel less embarrassed and more understand why not just you but many others in your position feel the same way. Maybe if you have a close friend that you can discuss this with you won't feel so embarrassed and they can also help redirect when you are having those feelings (as someone said, it's much like a former alcoholic wanting a drink or someone who quit smoking wanting a cigarette). Congratulations on finally leaving and keeping him blocked for such a long time- you're doing great! There's someone out there who will treat you well and be consistent in their love for you.",

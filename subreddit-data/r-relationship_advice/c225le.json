    "postText": "Orginal: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c13s1w/wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids_last/\n\n**TL;DR:** Wife and I tried having a baby. My balls are blocked, surgery is in July. Wife got pregnant anyways. It seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but I was told I shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery. Wife is celebrating, I can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating. Seeing Doctor on Monday to see if it could be mine.\n\nUpdate **TL;DR** at bottom\n\nFirst I just want to thank everyone who reached out and offered their story about similar.  I can't believe how many people are told they're completely sterile and end up being able to have kids anyways.  \n\nI took a lot of what you guys said to heart.  I had an ex of mine from years ago end up cheating on me, and it really left a scar for a while.  It wasn't until I got more involved with sports and getting in better shape that I was able to try and move on.  My wife and I actually met in a soccer league we were in together. We've had so much trust for so long that I thought those fears had gone away.  It wasn't until now that I really started to feel shaken like that again.\n\nBut I didn't want to let my past get in the way of what could be just a huge blessing.  A few people really articulated the right way to communicate my feelings in a way that wasn't accusatory and respectful of my wife, who's never really given me a reason to doubt her.\n\nIt's not uncommon for her to sometimes be home late, and she'll usually like to go straight to bed. I didn't want to dump this on her immediately and decided to give myself a night to sleep on it.  I got up pretty early just being restless, went for a run, and cleared my mind. I couldn't wait any longer.  I made our favorite omelets, and told her I needed to talk about something.\n\n\"You know I'm not Ashley, right?\"\n\nShe knows me well.  Ashley's my ex who cheated.\n\nSo first I apologized.  I apologized because I let this build up in my head for so long without talking with her about it sooner.  What should be blessing has been nothing but insecurity and fear for me.\n\nWe talked for a while.  I told her how happy it made me to see her ecstatic and excited for the baby. I told her how much I loved the relationship that we've built together, and I felt like an asshole for questioning her loyalty.  She had never given me a reason not to trust her and that I still couldn't emotionally get over the thoughts of infidelity because of my ex.  She thanked me for telling her, and she knew how hard it was for me to get over that.  She volunteered to have us get a paternity right when he/she's born, which made me feel a lot better at first.\n\nBut something still felt off.  I honestly don't know why, something about how she was so eager to get a paternity test, and almost not mad at me at all for having kept this from her.  Normally she would have been upset that I didn't bring it up right away, but there was just a weird feeling I couldn't shake for the rest of the day.\n\nIt seemed like she was saying all the right things, but I couldn't get rid of this clawing feeling inside my head.  Maybe I'm just being paranoid.  Maybe there's a gut feeling that I need to listen to.  But I ended up going to the appointment alone, as we \"decided\" it would good to see if I still needed the surgery.\n\nTurns out it's obstructive azoospermia.  I've read so many stories about people who were supposed to infertile end up getting pregnant. So I brought that up, and how my wife's pregnancy was affecting me. The urologist thought it would be pretty unlikely that I wouldn't need surgery to have a kid with how mine was presenting itself. He mainly tried to skirt around the topic, and mostly pushed me towards making sure she was actually pregnant.\n\nBeing there didn't really help.  I feel like I just got more uncertainty.  \n\nShe had another night being out to 8:30 last night.  We talked about scheduling an appointment to verify the pregnancy when she got home. She seemed a little confused, but then quickly agreed. She promised to do it in the morning.  I asked how work had gone, and she gave me a kind of non-commital answer about her boss pushing her too much and being stressed out.  \n\nThere's nothing huge there, but she just seemed off.  I really couldn't put my finger on it.  We were still acting all lovely-dovey, but something just felt wrong, and I couldn't talk about it without repeating the same conversation we had Sunday.\n\nI've been trying to throw myself into work to distract myself, but I haven't been able to focus.  We have a joint checking account that we'll sometimes move money in and out of, but really only use it for groceries or household items unless we talk about it beforehand.  This morning she moved half of it to hers, about $1700. We don't do that, she's never needed to before.  And I checked our health care portal, and she made the appointment for the one time Thursday that I mentioned I was busy working on-site. We were supposed to go together.\n\nI'm starting to go crazy. How do I bring this up that isn't me just having the same conversation again?  I'm looking into getting a second opinion for myself.  But I need a litmus test from objective outsiders to know if I'm really losing it or if this seems weird to someone else.\n\n**TL;DR Had good conversation about my ex-cheating before and those issues, something still felt off.  Urologist said I had obstructive azoospermia, implied I should \"make sure my wife is pregnant\" and didn't think I could be fertile.  Wife is taking money from joint account and booked her doctor appointment when I can't go.  Getting a second Urology opinion, also slightly going crazy.**\n\nUPDATE:  I've been trying to center myself.  We talked calmly for a bit on the phone.  She claimed she moved the money out in anticipation for the deductible payments she'll have with different visits.  I didn't bring up anything else, but she seemed a little impatient with me, probably rightly so, and implied we'd have a longer talk when she gets home.  I'm just trying to not overreact right now. I don't know what to think, this is either a misunderstanding on my side and Im a Father! Or...not.  Thankfully she's not working late today.  \n\nThank you those who are trying to keep me grounded.\n\nUPDATE:  I went for a long run to clear my mind.  Gotta shower, and then my wife should be home.  I'm going to go into the conversation with no judgement, just objectively walk out the facts and why I've still been struggling personally with some of them.  Regardless of what happens I'm done with any confusion left between us.\n\n  Thanks to those who messaged me and gave advice.\n\nHappy Update https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c2grcq/happy_update_wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for/?",

It includes taking your wife\u2019s blood (fetal DNA can be separated and tested) and your blood. She can get her blood taken first and then you could go a little later (you don\u2019t have to have it done at the same time). I only thought of this because it cost around $1700 to get it done. \ud83e\udd14",

What's confusing to me is why you're stressing about bringing this up without it being the same conversation, when the money thing is clearly a different conversation? \"How come you've moved half of the joint account to your own account?\" A perfectly simple question that should have a perfectly simple anwer, and there's zero reason not to just ask that question.\n\nEdit: As this blew up, another question, namely why not tell you about it beforehand? Because she must **know** that you'd notice it, and she must know that you'd have some questions! This isn't a few dollars going missing, it's **half the account**. Which is suspiciously precise, and surely significant that she'd move it, knowing you'd spot it, but not give you a heads up regardless, knowing you'd wonder what was up.",

We got divorced, I found a new partner and have a wonderful little girl with her.   \n\nLife can kick you hard, but it can also bless you in the best way.",

I'm a mess today, and I know from experience that tomorrow is going to be worse.\n\nI'm a fairly happy person overall, and love my life, but there is absolutely a cap on my ability to feel happiness, and not a single day has gone by that I haven't thought about what happened. Life is great, but trauma can fundamentally change who you are and permanently alter your baseline and maximum happiness.\n\nI wish the OP the very best outcome.",

That is something that requires explanation no matter what the relationship situation.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t wait for the baby being born, you can test for paternity as early as 8 weeks, so now, you can test this now....there is valid reason for that and with the money movement there is enough for you to force the issue.  It\u2019s non-invasive, go get it done.\n\n https://americanpregnancy.org/prenatal-testing/non-invasive-prenatal-paternity-test-nipp/\n\nEdit:\n\nTo add to this, this talk does not need to be emotional or accusatory.  Pure and simple:\n\n\u201cI love you, and I want to believe you\u2019ve been faithful, everything I know about says you are and have been.  However, we can\u2019t deny evidence just because we believe something, and right now there are some problems with evidence.  A doctor just told me I can\u2019t have children and I should make sure you are actually pregnant.  After we have a conversation, you move half our savings.  Either these are some miraculous coincidence or we have an issue I don\u2019t want to believe is possible.  So I have an answer to offset this evidence, we don\u2019t have to wait for the child to be born, please do this for me.  I\u2019m sorry I need to ask this of you, but neither of us can deny what this looks like....please don\u2019t make me have to be ignorant to my own logic.\u201d\n\nEdit 2: obligatory thanks for hardware kind strangers.  But one thing that keeps getting brought up, the new prenatal testing is completely non-invasive to the child and doesn\u2019t involve anything but a blood draw from the mother as the babies DNA is found in her plasma.  Cost of this procedure is between $400 and $2,000, so if your interested, shop around.",

My heart dropped as my eyes slowly skimmed past all of that. \n\nShe needs to speak up! \n\nI really, sincerely hope that the pregnancy was a miracle of some sort... She is highly aware of the trauma you've undergone due to the cheating exes you have had. To dance around the subject in the way I read (both post), that only fuels the paranoia you're experiencing.\n\nOP, keep us updated! Please and thank you!

It will also avoid some of the potentially to upset the wife in the case that she is pregnant with OP's child.\n\nIt is a strange set of circumstances that require a bit of investigation because of their nature, not because of OP or OP's wife's character.\n\nEmphasizing that OP does not want to believe that she would cheat is also very likely true, and reminds her that he believes the best of her despite these strange circumstances.\n\nAnyhow TLDR; I like this response best so far.",

Well, he immediately got pissed, because how in the HELL could I possibly be preggers if HE was fixed???\n\nI was baffled at his reaction. Until I realized he was suspicious of me!\n\nI immediately explained to him that IF I had cheated I would absolutely never, EVER tell him I was possibly pregnant! I would never admit to being pregnant, even as I delivered a baby. \"Nope, not pregnant!\" I told him I would gaslight the hell out of him if there was ever any chance I was having someone else's child!\n\nI started my period a few days later, no idea why it was late, and we still don't cheat on each other.\n\nI guess my take on your situation is why would she tell you she's pregnant if she knows you're infertile if she was cheating? It's easy to get a dna test done even while pregnant, so that shouldn't be an issue, and if she's ready willing and eager, that should lower any red flags.\n\nI do kind of wonder about your reaction. Maybe she isn't cool with the way you acted and is taking steps to protect herself.",

That's ok, I'll take some vacation and come along - it's too important to be close to you for that appointment.\n\n\\*chat about other stuff briefly, then\\*\n\nOh, btw, I noticed you moved 1700 out of our joint account.

            "comment": "Some of these responses are just downright ridiculous. My POV:\nMy husband had a vasectomy. Worked perfectly for 10 years. Suddenly I turned up pregnant, which ended in miscarriage around 6 weeks along. I insisted he go to urologist to make sure everything is okay. Urologist tells him nope- not possible. No sperm whatsoever so there was no possibility I was pregnant with his child. \nSome arguments ensued and I separated all finances because no way was I putting up with being believed to have cheated because of some moron doctor. Almost exactly a year later, I was pregnant again. This time she was a happy, healthy baby. At 9 weeks I paid $1800 for the NIPP test, partially to predict any health issues due to our ages and partially to prove paternity because I wanted the stupid urologist to be proven wrong. \nSure enough, my daughter is my husband\u2019s without any doubt. If I was the OPs wife I\u2019d be preparing to separate finances too, and looking into apartments at that. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not his, it doesn\u2019t mean it is. There are motives both ways. But I would much rather be a single parent than live with a man who believed I\u2019d cheated when I didn\u2019t. Rather than go with the conjecture just get the early paternity test and call it a day. It reduced drama and nobody has time for that.",

The test draws the mothers blood, and isolates the fetus DNA from it. Ask your doctor about it and set up the appointment.\n\nYou've been with her 6 years. Just ask her flat out to swear she's never cheated, knowing that you'll know the truth in 2 months. If she says she hasn't, take her at her word and push down all your insecurities for those 2 months, be on your best behavior, etc. That way if the baby is yours, you won't be eating shit until the end of time. If the baby is NOT yours, you're getting divorced anyway, so enjoy your last 2 months.",

I honestly think that if there was the smallest chance she got pregnant by another man the last thing she would do is parade it around to you - I have a feeling she would want to keep it under wraps! I think she would go to extreme lengths to make sure she cheated \"safely\" \n\n I also think her suggesting the PT is super super good sign. I think if she were cheating she would steer very clear from this and just try to use words to convince you or maybe even guilt tripping you for thinking she is cheating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWait it out and see. She seems to be acting alright which is good. If she did cheat, she basically knows there is a count down to when her life falls apart and im sure you would see that reflected in her in the coming weeks/months",

She's preparing to leave in case he gets violent.\n\nWe ONLY have his side. I have a feeling he has accused her of cheating before, given the way he talks about it and the way she responded. She also probably knows that guys in these situations can lose their freaking minds over nothing and if I were her I wouldn't want to be financially trapped if I had to leave fast.\n\nLike seriously. Think of this from her view.\n\nYou spend several months trying to get pregnant. You are told by a doctor that your husband is infertile, but there is a surgery to fix it. With this kind of infertility there *is* a possibility of pregnancy, it's just really tiny until the surgery.\n\nThen you get pregnant, and you're really happy. You tell your husband that you guys best the odds, and he doesn't seem excited. And the next day literally the first thing he does is accuse you of cheating on him. You haven't cheated on him. You've been trying to get pregnant with him for months. Now he is demanding a paternity test, and acting crazy.\n\nI don't think it's unreasonable to be concerned that could escalate. Every horror story about this online goes EXACTLY this way.",

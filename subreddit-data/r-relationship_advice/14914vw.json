    "postText": "90% of the time he is ok, but once in like two months he just snaps and starts blaming me for not cleaning enough and saying I am useless. We've been together for 4 years and I always try to solve it calmly and talk to him but he behaves like a 5yo, not talking to me, now he can't even stay in the same room. \n\nWhen I try to defend myself he doesn't care at all. I tried to explain that I am still a student, I had some little jobs just to help him with the financial state of our relationship but I feel like it was not enough for him even tho he told me it was (but then he used it in another argument against me). And I respect the fact that he is the one providing money, I told him many times, but every time we argue he holds it again me. \n\nEvery time I calmed him by talking to him, apologizing, but I don't feel like I should be doing this anymore since nothing changes and these days come back all the time. I feel like I should just let him be, wait till he calms down by himself but I am kinda afraid he will tell me to pack my things. \n\nIf any of you had similar experience with someone like this, was there a way to make them talk to you again?",

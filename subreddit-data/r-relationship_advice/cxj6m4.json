I have read pretty much all of them (special shout out goes to the person who says this was fake solely on the fact that I write like a man, whatever that means XD)\n\nAlso thanks for all the gold and silver, it's appreciated although if you wanna spend money give it to charity or something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went and talked to him this morning I told him that his father is not going to look at me and he needs to respect that. He was adamant that it needs to happen and accused me about lying about my virginity. I was trying to be calm and rational but he was not having it and just became more and more angry. I told him if he really loved me he would stand by me on this and tell his father no to which he slapped me and said he didnt need to prove anything.\n\nso I ended it and left him. I am currently back at my friends house being miserable and eating pizza which is pretty fun. \n\nso yup. Thanks everyone :)",

She only survived by wrapping her arms through the railing and screaming for help until hotel staff broke through the door (he didn't even stop trying to break her grip until they tackled him). \n\nEven in hindsight, nobody could really identify any warning signs that had gone ignored.

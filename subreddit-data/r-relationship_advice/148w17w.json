    "postText": "TLDR: Girl i was hoping to plan a future with drops bomb that shes pregnant again, a month before she comes home.\n\nFirst time poster, long time browser of different forums. At somewhat of a conflict here, thought id give this reddit thing a try. About a year ago now, i matched with a beautiful woman on tinder whose exactly my type, well call her Z, and for the first time i actually took her out. Talk about hit it off. Right from the beginning it was like we had known each other our entire lives. Talked about our dislike for dating apps and how disgusting most humans are, all the things we had in common, which was quite alot. Like i had found the long lost bestfriend id been looking for. She was a single mom to a boy (3yo), in the military, home on leave. Baby daddy not in the picture, caused her immense trauma before finally leaving. We spend her entire leave time together and before she leaves, i ask her to be my gf, she says yes. Exchange i love you's. She is stationed about 16hrs from me, so for the first two months, id drive down once a month on the weekends. Que the third month, ghosts me. Call her mom, says she had a mental break and is in a psych hospital. Two weeks later, long text from Z saying shes sorry but she cant do a relationship rn, no big deal, i get it. Keep in touch for the past few months, and fast forward to today.\n\nFirst time hearing from her in almost a month, despite having made plans for when shes home in July. While we were apart, i had tried to go on some dates and talked to a few women, but nothing had the spark that Z and i had from the beginning. If anything, i found these other dates an utter waste of time, all the while Z is floating around my head. Que text exchange today:\n\nZ: Sorry for not replying lately, lifes been super rough these past few months.\n\nme: Oh? whats wrong? Im always here if you need someone to talk to \n\nZ: Well i guess its time to tell you since ill be home soon. I got involved with a guy for a bit and ended up pregnant. When i told him, he assaulted me and left. So ive been dealing with coping with that, pressing charges, and being pregnant again. Its been terrible, and i feel horrible as im nowhere near as connected to this baby as i was the first.\n\nme: so sorry, etc etc, wish that didnt happen, etc etc, dont really know what to say to that considering i still think about you daily, have turned down dates over the hope of this being a thing. Pretty upset over the entire situation really.\n\nZ: Ive been kicking myself in the ass for months now because i know i shouldve stayed with you. I know youd never do that to me, and i miss the hell out of you. I hope we can catch up when im home.\n\nme: id love to\n\nAnd that is the truth, for about a year now ive been waiting for her to come home next month to figure out where this was going as i see a real future with this woman. But now, shes pregnant again with someone elses child. I never had a problem with her first child, hell i love kids. But going into a 'new' relationship with a newborn that isnt mine makes me.. uncomfortable.. i suppose. And she obviously hasnt felt the same toward me, or we wouldnt be here right now. Was hoping to be having a child of my own in the somewhat near future. I know i love her, and was prepared to be a father-like-figure to her son, but an infant seems like a whole different ballgame. Maybe im over thinking it and because i love her it is what it is? Maybe by the time she comes home ill be just as excited as i was when i met her son for the first time, i dont know. Or do i just do my best to remain friends with her? Feeling very conflicted.",

She will use you as the back up she settled for and will leave you for the man she really wants in the future. I\u2019m in the army and that type of woman is common. Until she gets out she\u2019d constantly be moving to different duty stations and meeting new people. Plus you don\u2019t know the whole story about the baby daddy, they may have broken up on bad terms and she\u2019s just telling you it\u2019s assault to have you sympathize trust me some women do that. If she shipped overseas then that guy was her battle-boo meaning they arranged ahead of time that they would be together there. You gotta have more self respect hun.",

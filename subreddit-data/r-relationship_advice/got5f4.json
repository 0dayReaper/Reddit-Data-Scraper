    "postText": "[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/goaks4/i_heard_my_boyfriends_parents_say_something/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\n\nI decided to tell my boyfriend what happened. I told him last night, at 2AM. He was livid. I barely had time to finish the story before he started packing our bags. He kept on apologizing for the situation he put me in, and I could see how horrible he felt about all of this. He told me he wanted to talk to his parents about what they said and asked if I wanted to be a part of the conversation or if I\u2019d rather wait in the car. Not being a person who likes confrontation at all, I hesitated but ultimately said I wanted to be there. I just didn\u2019t want to actively participate in the conversation, I was too uncomfortable. \n\nHe woke his parents up, sat them down and told them what I had heard. They were clearly extremely uncomfortable and kind of just stared at him, like they couldn\u2019t believe he was doing this. He told them it was unacceptable and how ashamed he was of them. He also told them that when/if we would decide to speak to them again, they better be ready to sincerely apologize and do better, because he wouldn\u2019t tolerate anything else. He also mentioned that their opinion would have no impact on who he would decide to marry. His mom looked like she wanted to say something but he didn\u2019t let her, got up and we left. We were quite shaken up on the ride home, but he took the time to explain to me what he knew of why his parents behaved this way.\n\nBasically, he remembers his parents making racist remarks here and there when he was little (not just about black people but POC in general). He didn\u2019t really know it was wrong until he got out of his hometown and realized his parents were very wrong in their views. With time, he saw his parents less and less, because their views regarding race and other issues just didn\u2019t align with his at all anymore and it would create animosity every time he visited them. When he met me, even before we became a couple and were just friends, he would often post pictures of us on Facebook and his parents would see them. They never mentioned anything. When they learned that we were a couple, they said they wanted to meet me, and he wasn\u2019t sure of their sincerity. He said they talked about me when they would call him, and for a whole year, my bf basically tried to make sure that they were actually okay with our relationship. His parents kept saying not to worry, that they had learned from their past mistakes, asking him to trust them. After a year, he finally believed them and that\u2019s when he decided to introduce us. He was so happy to see how nice and accepting they were towards me. He said it himself, he was too naive.\n\nHe was pretty much crying telling me this, but I could tell he tried not to because he felt responsible and didn\u2019t want to make it about himself. Maybe it makes me dumb, but I don\u2019t blame him. I know him, and he wouldn\u2019t put me in a situation like that on purpose. I believe him when he says he truly thought they changed. He apologized numerous times and told me I never had to see them again, and that he wouldn\u2019t either for a very long while. He was already not close with them, and this situation didn\u2019t help at all. He made it a point to say that what his mother said about him wasn\u2019t true (that he wouldn\u2019t marry me because he knows they would disapprove). \n\nWe talked about it a lot since last night. We barely slept. And I decided I do want to stay with him. A big majority of the comments under my last post told me that my best option was to leave him, a lot of it coming from POC. And I understand why. But, I do love him very much and I really do not want to leave him because his parents hate our relationship. I think I would regret it. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019ll be easy and maybe I am making a mistake, but I want to be with him. Maybe it\u2019s disappointing to a lot of you, but it\u2019s my decision.\n\n*btw I didn\u2019t contact daily mail, they published my post without asking me*\n\nThank you all very much for your advice. x",

It\u2019s the shifting tide in generations that makes these changes. He was already clearly picking her over them. This update is just the icing on the cake. \n\nOP, you are not naive. This phrase works both ways. When someone shows you who they are, believe them. He has shown you he is a good and loving man, despite what his parents tried to instill in him. He loves you and has your back. Never, ever let racists or bigots dictate your life. That\u2019s just picking a losing side. \n\nUpdate again with wedding deets? :D\n\nEDIT: Thank you kind stranger for the silver!\n\nEDIT 2: And now platinum. I appreciate it so much!",

Get out. \n\nIt's so stupid because there are situations where that stuff actually applies but the majority of it it's just petty and stupid stuff that can be resolved with convo and therapy.\n\nI always use myself as an example and I'll do it again: in the start of my relationship with my girlfriend, there was a huge difference between us: I was very affectionate. She wasn't. Asked for advice on reddit about this: ***\"BREAK UP!\"***\n\nI was a bit insecure of this situation because so many people were telling me to break up.. But I then thought that nobody really knew our backstory and our relationship, and that this was the internet. So I ignored the advice and made up my own: Talk, give her some space, and she would give me more affection too.\n\nMonths have been by and now we're both around the same level of affection, im still more affectionate but the difference is small.\n\nHave a nice day redditors!\n\nAnd remember to use your brain when getting reddit's advice. You can ask for advice, but you should always make your own decisions. *Conversation is the key*.\n\nStay safe!",

Emotionally? My mother died a long time ago. I feel super fortunate that I've got a wonderful new family I've built myself, and I always try to bring others from similar backgrounds into my family.\n\nMy cut-off wasn't as dramatic or racially motivated, but I had to have a conversation with my parents that was similar to the conversation OP's BF had with his parents, just on the religious side.

IMO you\u2019re lucky to have him. Yes if you spend your life with him his parents will have to either change their ways or you will have to cut contact but it seems he has no problem with that as long as he\u2019s got you. From personal experience, dealing with tough shit like this will bring you two closer and cement what sounds like an already great relationship. Best of luck!",

I'd not be surprised if the way that OP's boyfriend reacted was very much an exception.\n\nI mean, my situation isn't comparable, but if I overheard a boyfriend's parents speaking about how they don't want their son marrying a tr***y - or even just an immigrant since I'm also that, my immediate gut reaction would lean towards leaving too. Like, the cards would be stacked against my partner from the start and I'd have to see a response like OP got to stay. \n\nUltimately you can't stay in a relationship with someone who's weak on people treating you like that, so I'm not surprised that people's immediate reaction would be negative. I'm glad that OP's boyfriend responded how he did though - he's a keeper.",

Around 8 or 9, my 2nd oldest brother was pinned to the floor while brandishing a knife towards my dad. Ill never forget peeking out the door and seeing it. Or the blue and red lights flashing on my bedroom wall.\n\nI grew up middle class in some ways, but echoes of real prairie poverty resonate through my family and past.\n\nAnd the worst part is I never talk about it.\n\nI appreciated the honest and authentic reflection on where you've come from but also what you decided to be. Maybe someday I can start to actually express my story in a constructive manner.\n\nThank you.",

It is vitally important that POC make certain that if they want to marry a white person, that person will do what it takes to protect them. It\u2019s vitally important that white people who choose to marry POC or people of another ethnicity know that they have the responsibility to back them up. This obviously goes for any two people choosing to spend a life together, but with socially salient categories like race, ethnicity, religion, etc, it really isn\u2019t an option. \n\nOP\u2019s partner had the most mature response possible for the situation he was given.

He stood by you, he confronted his parents, he told them they were not only wrong but that they would not see or hear from either of you for a long time as a direct result of their fucked up beliefs. He made sure you had the choice to be a part of the confrontation and the choice to opt out if you wanted to. And then he immediately got you out of the situation and sincerely apologised. \n\nHes got a good head on his shoulders. And he clearly cares about you very much. \n\nIts hard to stand up to your folks. Its even harder for some to cut them off when you realize your folks are toxic. \n\nYour boyfriend probably should have warned you ahead of time so it didn't come as such a surprise when they finally started vocalizing their shitty views.  But I understand why he didn't. He genuinely wanted them to have changed and he genuinely wanted you to have a good time, worry free. \n\nHe acted the best he could given the situation. And you have every right to be proud of him. He did good. And hes shown you that he will have your back even if it comes down to family conflict and pressures. If he can confront his own parents that way, he can confront anything that comes his way. \n\nHe sounds like a good partner. And he sounds very sweet and caring. You are a lucky girl. He very clearly cherishes you. Hold on to each other. The two of you can take on anything. Its honestly extremely refreshing to see some ones partner sticking up for them completely without question. \n\nI know you said his parents and him arent close as it is. But make sure you give him a little extra reassurance and support. Make sure he knows he can talk to you about how he's feeling. Going no contact, temporary or otherwise, with your family is hard. A lot of conflicting emotions can pop up. He might be sad for a little while, since he was so hopeful that they finally changed their ways. \n\nYou two sound like a good couple. I hope you guys have a long and happy future together.",

She was a nice and sweet person aside from being racist. It was not the most comfortable thing to hear her refer of POC. It was actually my first time hearing anyone speak those terms in real life. My family were the only ones not 100% caucasian. My mother is mixed with caucasian but not my father. So here a story that my give you some hope if you do marry him. Its short.\n\nMy grandpa rest his soul was the sweetest thing. He only saw people. He came to our home during a war. It was only 1 of 2(merchant was the other) ways to get here at the time. He met my grandma and and she hated him, but he found his one and only. He would get a cup of coffee and something to eat everyday just to talk to her. And in his word,\" I like to tease her and make her mad so she would have to come and talk to me.\" Eventually they went on a few dates and he won her over. They married and had children. He sent his mom a family painted portrait. He later flew to visit his her only to find that after all those years she had not accepted his family. She left the portrait wrapped up and stored away were no one could see his mixed family. He told her, \"If you dont accepted my family your not my mother and your dead to me. You'll never hear from me again!\" She had no choice but to put her racism and pride aside. He loved his wife and children. He made his choice with my nana. His mom put the portrait up.\n\nMy great grandmother was a racist but she didn't want to loose her son. She accepted us and even tho she was still that way when i met her all she did was show us love. Sorry this is long.

I say stick with him, as long as OP was your only big concern ofc.",

            "comment": "Back in college my (now ex) girlfriend's parents pretty openly made racist remarks about me right in front of me (in Spanish, assuming I didn't understand). They were Central American immigrants. I'm a lightskinned black dude. They were not crazy about their daughter talking to me at all. At first we both kind of ignored it and she wrote it off as them being out of touch and set in their ways.\n\nI went through the whole traditional song and dance of speaking to the father about dating her and seemed to gain at least a little respect from him for that. But definitely never got it from the mom. And even with him I'd always get that look. Hard to describe it but just this kind of disapproving  look.\n\nWe were pretty much crazy about each other so both of us were cool ignoring it. Up until the point her dad started forcing her to attend their Hispanic church. I learned later this was his little way of hooking her up with a dude of their own race instead. Eventually his little plan and the shit they'd been filling her mind with set in. Things got weirdly strained between us. Eventually we broke up. She quickly got with this other Central American dude from her church and they were quick to get married. For reasons I probably don't need to explain.\n\nShe was not happy in that relationship at all. I know all this about it because years after we split she caught back up with me via text and a few lunch dates and told me everything. And about how much she hated him and felt trapped and fucked things up with our relationship. She was on the verge of leaving him at least. Borderline suicidal at worst. Then she found out she got pregnant. Years later, today, they're still together afaik working it out for the son's sake. I wish them luck. And I'll never fully trust anyone to go against their family's wishes.\n\nHopefully your guy is one of the good ones. His reaction tells me he might be..",

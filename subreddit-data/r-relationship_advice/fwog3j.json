    "postText": "I tried yo post this before but it got removed as I hadn't waited 48 hours. Hopefully this time it works!\n\nHello, lovely people. As promised I am back with an update for you on all what happened the other day. [Here it is, if you missed it](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fv7ec7/my_son_and_his_friend_are_a_couple_how_do_i_let/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\nWant to top this off with a big thank you to everyone who left such lovely, thoughtful comments. I honestly didn't expect so many people to see the post, I was thinking maybe an absolute maximum of 100 people and even that seemed like loads. It was lovely to hear back from so many of you, and I'm forever grateful for the fantastic advice most of you gave. Also overjoyed by my new adopted reddit children haha you're all doing amazing and I'm very proud of all of you. Also big thanks to all of the lovely people who sent me such sweet messages of support, and to those of you who reached out to me because you felt you needed someone to talk to. If anyone else feels that way and is in need of dadly advice, do feel free to give me a message and I will do my best to help out :) \n\nOkay you all want me to shut up and tell you what happened haha. My son was busy with some assignments both for his freelancing job and his uni work most of the day and I didn't want to disturb him so I waited until after dinner to chat. \"Friend\" went to have a bath while my son and I watched telly. I tod him face to face \"Son, I love you very much. You don't have to tell me anything you don't want to, but I want you and [friend] to feel comfortable being yourselves in my house and you don't ever need to hide anything from me, alright?\" \n\nWell, it turns out a hell of a lot of you were right. Son burst out laughing and said \"oh thank *God*, I reckoned you'd clicked on but didn't say anything because *I* didn't want to make *you* feel weird\". Basically we've each been pussyfooting around the topic because neither one of us wanted to make the other uncomfortable talking about it. We had a bit of a chat and he confirmed that I'm right in thinking they've been together since their first year of uni and that's why they moved in together in second year. However, apparently I'm not as brilliant and intuitive as I thought because apparently one of his friends in secondary school was his boyfriend for a year and I had absolutely no idea haha. He went and talked to the boyfriend after his bath, and then we all had a bit of a further chat. Sadly a lot of you were right that the reason boyfriend doesn't have a good relationship with his parents is because he came out to them a few years ago and they effectively disowned him, so I made sure he knows that he's a part of our family now. \n\nSorry if that isn't all as exciting and groundbreaking as some of you had hoped haha! I'm glad this is something my boy no longer feels he has to keep from me and I'm very glad he's happy with his partner. Thank you all again for the help!",

We are pretty dedicated Christians (my dad and me, my brother is not but would say he\u2019s spiritual). We think people saying their Christian faith is the reason they cut off a gay friend or family member (especially their own kid) is INSANE and the OPPOSITE of what Jesus would do. Jesus called us to love. However, I\u2019m well aware of how some other \u201cChristians\u201d behave and it breaks my heart. It literally never crossed either of our minds to reject my brother. \n\nThese others\u2019 behavior is very possibly driven by fear, or just VERY BAD biblical teaching. \n\nAnd of course there are other religions who reject gays, but I can only speak to the one I know the most about.",

I\u2019ve known her since 1st grade, her father had 2 daughters so she always had guy friends come over and her dad would sort of adopt us. He and his wife would let us stay at their vacation house on cape cod in the summer without her being there, really great family. Anyway, she had never dated a black guy before she met her husband (who is a really good dude in my estimation). Anyway, her dad is an Irish catholic boomer from Boston, so needless to say he was brought up in an atmosphere that was pretty homogenous, with prejudice abound. But he\u2019s such a nice, funny, happy guy that he just doesn\u2019t get worked up about anything. So we were talking about her getting married and he goes \u201cyea, once you get used to him being black, he\u2019s really great.\u201d He meant no harm in it, and it was a good example of how racism isn\u2019t your first thought, it\u2019s your second, third, and forth thoughts.",

The good thing is that they never ever said anything to their kid. They never treated the date differently... because they were just gracious loving people. \n\nSo you can ask... but you'll learn more by watching subtle interactions.\n\nAlso, family I know who never went to church suddenly have deep feelings about religion once they have their own child.

He didn't tell us intentionally, his dad and I found some interesting things in our search history on one of the computers one day and thought we should bring it up as he'd been struggling lately and we wondered if that wasn't part of what was bothering him.\n\nThough we approached him together, he didn't want to talk much about it with his dad. My husband is definitely a \"macho\" kind of guy for lack of a better word, though not the d-bag kind that picks fights in parking lots (just likes to work on cars, hunt, go to the range, traditionally \"manly\" things? Though I know it's different nowadays, but I digress) and even though he was trying to exude acceptance and understanding and told him that he loves him just the same regardless, he still felt weird talking to him about it. \n\nSo he came to me later to discuss, which is also fine, I've practically raised him as he's lived with us most of his life, but it has always been a delicate dance since I'm not his \"actual\" parent, so I was surprised. I reiterated that we love him no matter what and it was okay to be confused and explore that a bit to gain some clarity on it and see where he stands. \n\nHis biggest concern was that we not tell his mother, though, as she purports herself to be a Christian and he was terrified that she and her parents would disown him, which wouldn't surprise me tbh. I assured him that it was not our place to share that with her and when or if he wanted to, we'd have his back and we'd be here no matter what. \n\nHe hasn't said anything in a long while and it seems more like curiosity and confusion than anything else, but my heart breaks for him that he has to be that worried that his mother will disown him if he truly decides that's what he wants.",

I've had kind of the opposite experience as you, being the child of a parent that was a bit afraid to come out to us kids. Fortunately, in our case, we all kind of had an idea and none of us couldn't have cared less. We did kinda force her to come out, because we got tired of her trying to hide her obvious girlfriend, but not without telling her that we just wanted her to admit it because we didn't care and we wanted her to stop feeling the need to keep it a secret. We just wanted our mom happy, and she is now, so much happier than when she was still with our father. It makes me very happy that things have changed so much from my mom's generation, and yes, sadly not everyone is there yet, but more are than ever before which is amazing and I hope this trend continues.",

It was a hard year for him, but I'm glad he got it out and was more comfortable with all of us on staff. \n\nI think about him a lot though, and how scared he was too talk to me, and how crazy scared he was too talk to his dad. I'm sorry to any and all that have to go through that, I can't even imagine that level of pain and anxiety.

            "comment": "I'm gay (lesbian), and back in 1991 my father and I had the same conversation. That was before being gay was accepted anywhere,  and it was at the height of the AIDS epidemic, so even though I knew intrinsically that my parents loved me no matter what--I had friends who thought that, too, but who were kicked out, or told not to come back home (we were in our early 20s. I had already been living on my own for three years). I remember my friend Rob from art school being crushed that his parents wanted nothing to do with him once he came out to them. Devastated. They were so close,  like my parents and me.\n\nAnyway,  I told my father I needed to discuss something important with him,  and he picked me up in NYC;  we planned on talking when we got home, at which point  I locked myself in the bathroom, and started crying. \nThis went on for awhile:  I didn't want to disappoint him. He finally said,  \"I know you're trying to tell me that you're like your friend, R, and that's fine. I don't care. I love him and I love you. I knew since you were a kid.\"\n\nI remember saying, \"You know R is gay??\" and he laughed,  not making fun, just letting me know, \"Of course I know.\"\n\nAnd then I asked him,  if he knew I was gay since I was a kid (I don't know why,  I wasn't a tomboy or anything), why didn't he tell me? It could have saved me years of anguish!\n\nAnd, looking back,  this is the most poignant moment: he said it was my journey and I needed to come to terms with it and process it in my own way, in my own time.\n\nThat was the right thing to do. And quite gracious and insightful. \n\nThank goodness for parents like you, and like my parents. Unconditional love. \n\nI suppose many on Reddit users don't understand where I'm coming from because, thank goodness,  you grew up AFTER Ellen came out on TV, which,  after the dust settled, created a cataclysmic change for the better in society. When I say it is like night and day... I'm not exaggerating.  Certainly--absolutely!--the Stonewall uprising was the beginning (I had friends in NYC who were there), and Larry Kramer and ACT UP were also huge in affecting change,  but if I had to pinpoint the exact time the tides started to change, it was when Ellen DeGeneres came out on her show, and then the next episode when her mother on the show (played by her real life mother) went to a PFLAG meeting and realized she was not the only parent who was afraid her gay child would be ostracized and have a difficult life-- which no parent wants for their child. \n\nThis is the exact moment my mom started openly talking about me being gay to her close friends, and friends at work.  This was six years after I came out.\n\nEllen's career was ruined because she came out. But again,  what she did freed up parents and their gay children,  and gay parents and their straight children, to start talking without fear. \n\nHere's an example of how far her bold actions moved us as a culture, and how ingrained in our culture her ideal to \"Be kind to one another\" became: \n\nMy nephew is 25 years old. He was 12 when I came out to him. Still holding onto my teenage angst, fear of being loathed for being different,   I was afraid that he would be disappointed. I was his favorite person in the world,  besides his parents and sister,  of course,  but silly Aunt MusicTheory251 the professional musician with a great sense of humor--I was still holding onto my fear of rejection. But when I told him his reply was,  \"THAT'S SO COOL! I LOVE ELLEN!!\" And he smiled and started tossing his baseball up in the air again and catching it as if I'd just told him my favorite ice cream flavor or something of little to no significance.\nThat was an eye opener, that maybe it was time for me to let down my guard; throw away the things that I thought kept me safe before i was an adult. \n\nUltimately, if someone doesn't like me because I'm gay,  that's their loss. \n\nSo Redditors,  I, too, would like to thank your generation.\nThe amount of acceptance and unconditional love most of you have for your friends and fellow human beings, after going to college in NYC in the 1980s,   I never thought I would see in my lifetime. \n\nWe've had a minor setback the past few years... but you open minded, open hearted souls will prevail. \n\nThank you @throwralovemygayson \u2764",

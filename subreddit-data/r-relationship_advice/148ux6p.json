    "postText": "\nSo it's my GF's birthday coming up soon and I have everything sorted. I've booked us a trip away, bought her a nice photo album of our favourite memories of us and bought her a really nice necklace. \n\nSo last week as we were through seeing her parents and sorting some of the remaining stuff for our trip away we were walking through the mall and she goes into this store, naturally i follow since we're just window shopping. I can't remember the name of it. But anyways it was a lingerie store. So we're walking through and she is stopping and looking at various items. she was looking at the lingerie stuff and then looking at me. Then looking at the lingerie stuff then looking at me. She had a smirk on her face. She knew what she was doing. Just like running her hand over them then looking me up and down. That kinda look. You know that look. Then I went 'what?' And she went, \"nothing, come on\" with that cheeky smirk of hers and took my hand and we left the store. \n\nNow ladies, I know a hint when I see one. She was totally hinting for me to get her some lingerie right??? So later that night I asked her \"btw, totally random question\" (obviously totally not a random question) \"but just wondering what size you are in lingerie?\" She then asked me looking really excited saying \"why?\" I then said \"oh no reason.\" But she text me them after i left to go home that night. So I know her sizes. But I have a problem. A big problem.\n\nHere's the problem. I've been online and I do not know where to start looking. I would go back to the store we were in but it's a 4 hour drive away and by the time I get there and back she would know I was away doing something and if I'm honest I also just cannot be bothered driving that far haha. I've been searching online and I can't seem to find anything or know which ones to go for. It was like Royal Blue bra and pants, and an emerald green set. thats all i remember. Also I'm scrolling through online and looking at pictures of models and it just feels weird so please please please tell me some suggestions for nice lingerie set I can get her. Looking for something really nice and don't mind the price. As long as it's not super expensive.",

    "postText": "So I (26F) noticed my husband for some reason deletes all of his social media apps when he\u2019s home, but has them when he leaves or isn\u2019t around me. Another thing is we\u2019re literally not friends on any social media either. When I asked him why he does that he replies \u201ci want to avoid fights and arguments with you.\u201d I basically just asked why would there be an argument if you have one and you\u2019re not doing anything wrong? Again, same response. I\u2019m honestly getting a little tired of him doing the same thing, I feel like there has to be a reason for this? We\u2019re not as intimate as before either, for about the last month. Typically my husband would like to be intimate nightly, now we\u2019re at weekly. I just find his behavior bizarre lately, and he makes it seem like I\u2019m overreacting. Not to mention when I ask anything, he explodes on me, blames it on stress. Which I can understand but he does it over minuscule things lately\u2026 I\u2019m feeling like the only reason I\u2019m here is because I\u2019m a stay at home mom and he just needs me here 24/7 with our children. My only option would be moving an hour away to my moms. Idk what else to do\u2026\n\nEDIT; Also keeps making the comment \u201cI don\u2019t care\u2026 all you girls are the same.\u201d An i crazy?",

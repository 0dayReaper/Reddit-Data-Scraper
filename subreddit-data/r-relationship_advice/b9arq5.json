    "postText": "[Link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b6fd8u/my_22f_boyfriends_24m_new_tattoo_makes_me_feel/)\n\n[Link to update](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b78m0s/update_my_22f_boyfriends_24m_new_tattoo_makes_me/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuper long post incoming so apologies in advance.\n\nI wasn't going to bother with this update but after all the support and love I received from people in this sub I feel like the least I can do in return is give some closure for anyone wanting it. Before I begin I just want to thank everyone who gave advice, I didn't respond to everyone but I read almost every response. I stopped reading my Pm's because a lot of the messages I was getting were graphic and negative but I appreciate the few of you who were positive and helpful in your messages and I'm sorry if I didn't respond to you. Now on to the update: \n\nIt's been a crazy week and a lot has happened since our argument. My bf spent two nights at his sisters and during this time I decided to just send him a link to my reddit posts instead of writing him a letter. I felt like everything I needed to say was in those two threads and it would be good for him to read people's opinions. His sister read through them too and that started a massive argument between them that revealed some shocking information that led to my bf coming back home and completely breaking down. \n\nWe spent the whole night talking where he revealed he's been using a lot of drugs recently and drinking a lot more to deal with his grief. He told me he feels responsible for his brothers death because while I was pushing for us to file for custody he was on the fence about the idea and now he feels his brother would still be alive if we had filed for custody over him when I first suggested it. He said because of this he's been developing a lot of feelings of resentment towards me (I don't really understand why and neither does he) which he recognises as being unjustified so he's been bottling them up along with everything else which essentially led to him flipping out when I brought up his tattoo. Obviously I knew he was having a hard time dealing with his brother's death but I must have been viewing the world through rose coloured glasses because I never would have realised how bad it was if he hadn't told me. \n\nI was really hoping it wouldn't be the case but unfortunately a few of you redditors were right on the mark. He regrets the tattoo and discovering I wasn't happy with it either sent him over the edge into panic mode and he tried to use it as an excuse because the very idea of regretting the tattoo or wanting to get rid of it makes him feel even guiltier. Truth is he hates the tattoo and he tries not to look at it at all. He apologised about a hundred times for reacting the way he did and for not considering he was making me look at the tattoo in general, as well as during sex. He completely understood where I was coming from when I brought it up, he just reacted the way he did because he essentially had a \"mental breakdown\" in his opinion. \n\nI apologised for my \"jack off\" comment. Initially he was quite shocked and did take the comment as an insult but after reading the reddit post he understood what I meant and was very forgiving. He apologised for accusing me of never caring for his brother. \n\nWe then talked about the argument he had with his sister... \n\nUp until now I was under the impression that my bf went on his own to get the tattoo done, but it turns out his sister went with him to his first session and it was her who convinced him to get a portrait on his chest whereas my bf originally wanted to get a drawing of his brothers favorite stuffed animal. Not only this but during their argument it came out that his sister wanted him to get such a drastic tattoo because she was hoping it would cause a rift between us. Apparently she felt like I was tearing their family apart by trying to file for custody and she doesn't want me dating her brother anymore. \n\nIf that sounds totally ridiculous to you, it's because it is. Not defending her actions, what she's done is absolutely deplorable, but a history of mental illness bipolar/schizophrenia does run in their family. We're certain his sister suffers from bipolar disorder as well, or possibly something else, but she refuses to be diagnosed. \n\nMy bf didn't go around to all our friends, that was his sister lying. She was the only one he told and he's promised to set the story straight for any family members she mentions it to. We've both apologised for what we said and we're going to stay together and work through things together. \n\nIn the short term we're going to be getting in contact with a grief counsellor and try out some of the suggestions for how to make things less awkward in the bedroom. In the long term we're going to consult a tattoo artist to see what can be done in terms of lasering it off/turning it in to something else. Bf doesn't feel comfortable lasering it off and currently his favorite idea is to get a heap more tattoos to try and make it less noticeable. I'm a fan of this idea as well. \n\nAs for his sister, bf is currently debating whether to cut her out of his life or not. I don't think he should, I feel like he's lost enough family but I'll respect whatever decision he comes to. \n\nI think that just about wraps everything up. A huge thank you again to everyone for all your advice and help, it really helped me get through this horrible and awkward situation. \n\nI mean this in the nicest way possible when I say I hope I never have to post on this subreddit again. \n\ntl;dr - We both apologised for what we said in the heat of the moment. Boyfriend revealed he regrets getting the tattoo and it was his sister who convinced him to get it in the hopes it would break us up. We're seeking grief counselling and considering getting more tattoos to make the current one less noticeable.",

The vindictive bitch component is the sister\u2019s personality and you should cut her out 100%. \n\n\nA lot of the comments on here are congratulating you on salvaging your relationship from the flaming pile that it was a little while ago. You need to prepare for it to flare up again. Have money saved only accessible to you. I hope things work out for you but you should be prepared for the worst. There are way so many red flags here you\u2019re willingly overlooking, again.\n\nEdit: My first gold. Thank you. Gonna add a bit here saying I wish OP the best. \n\nAlso, if you or a family member or friend has signs or symptoms of mental illness please get help. Pharmacotherapy can take a while to get the right drug combo that works for you. But once it gets dialed in, it can be life saving. And a shout out for ECT for treatment resistant depression.\n\n\nThere\u2019s no shame in getting an arm splinted if you break it or taking blood pressure medication if you need it. If there\u2019s something affecting the neurotransmitters or their receptors in your brain there is no shame in seeking treatment for it. \n\n\nAll that being said. The OP does need to look out for herself. And safeguard her happiness. You can\u2019t save someone by setting yourself on fire and it\u2019s important that her SO seek professional help for his grief and substance abuse. ",

I had been living with my best friend for 8 out of the 10 years I\u2019ve known her. Didn\u2019t realize how much I relied on her until we moved apart. Totally understand the reliance on other people and feeling abandoned even though rationally that\u2019s not what happened at all. My next housemate has BPD and threw all my stuff on the front lawn a couple months after moving in (long story but wasn\u2019t warranted). A week later I got sexually assaulted (I\u2019m a dude). A week later I kinda broke and gave myself alcohol poisoning. That was a fun month. But made me consider seeing a doctor about my mental health. Just got health insurance for the first time of my adult life (I\u2019m 28). My family seems to think medication is a \u201ccop out\u201d and people can just exercise and do things to \u201cget over it\u201d.",

When I am afraid to leave the house, things are about to get very bad. Skipping meals, reduced sleep, impulsive purchases, paranoia, obsessive hobbies, minor delusions of grandeur...it's a lot of minor stuff which you have to learn to observe. And it's safer to assume the worst if these start happening and get an appointment with my psychiatrist ASAP.\n\n",

As long as your have someone with training helping monitoring your symptoms keep doing what works.\n\n(I have a feeling that sounded condescending. I just wanted to expand on what you said.

Well-known enough that doctors warn patients with familial history of schizophrenia to avoid cannabis, as it is believed to help trigger the condition and exacerbate symptoms.\n\nThe self-medication hypothesis (arguing that cannabis is an effect of pre-psychotic symptoms, rather than a cause) has been around since the 80s. It's very hard to disprove as we can't ethically have a study prescribing teenagers a drug that we suspect might harm them (which would be necessary for a controlled study). However, [the hypothesis has been addressed repeatedly and evidence seems to point away from it](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2004.00683.x). For example, the self-medication hypothesis assumes that a person would be more likely to seek cannabis after experiencing some psychotic-like symptoms, which [is not the case](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291702006384).",

Better for the most part now as I\u2019ve gotten treatment and I stopped smoking weed for over a year and a half but weed induced psychosis is very real, weed is not a wonder drug like it\u2019s being peddled their are side effects to overuse (as with everything)",

Granted, everyone is different, but even during my incredibly high manic episodes, my irrational thinking is more along the lines of \"100 notebooks and 15 bottles of orange juice sounds like a good purchase right now\". Not \"I'm going to ruin my brothers relationship and lie to everybody\". I don't have any concrete information on schizophrenia, though, but if she's refusing to seek help that's an entirely different problem and on her to figure out.\n\nAs for your BF, I absolutely agree with having him seek some professional help/testing and possible diagnosis, especially if mental illness runs in the family. I found out I had bipolar when I was 21, but my doctor says it likely kicked when I was in high school given my extensive history of poorly treated depression and a bunch of other factors. The grief in itself/argument with his sister could have triggered something. \n\nIf he does have schizo/bipolar/something else, it's going to be a rocky road for awhile. It took me about 30 differenrnt medications, dosages, and combos before I found stability. Thankfully my husband's a sweetheart and was there with me through all of it, but this period of time can be really challenging on both the patient and the loved ones. If he does get a diagnosis and you two want to stay together, try to do some research yourself. If possible, see if you can go with him to talk with his psychiatrist. Then at least you have some base idea of what he's going through and what outward problems you might be dealing with. \n\nJust be careful and realistic. I am happy you guys were able to talk, but there's still a lot to deal with.",

Seems reasonable to me to just go through a few weeks of pain rather than totally cover his entire torso or end up with a bunch of tattoos he may not have wanted originally just to distract from a single tattoo. \n\nIt would be like putting flame decals on your car to cover up a dent instead of just going through the effort to hammer it out.

Mental illness can exacerbate that, and I\u2019m sure that OP didn\u2019t necessarily mean to blame her actions on her mental illness, but I\u2019d like to just add a reminder to the conversation that being bipolar does not equal being crazy or toxic or manipulative.\n\nThe emotional ups and downs and detachment from reality definitely make it easier to be that way if you already have an inclination for it, but I just think that the stigma is harmful because it makes people feel like they can\u2019t work past those tendencies, or that because their illness is lifelong, they have no responsibility to try to improve. \n\nAgain, I\u2019m not saying that anyone was explicitly blaming the sister\u2019s horrible actions on being bipolar, I would just like everyone to remember that there\u2019s more to it than that. Plenty of people suffering from bipolar disorder, even undiagnosed, are kind and loyal people. ",

I dated a man I loved more than anything, and he felt the same way. But something happened that shifted him. He started drinking, verbally abusing me and sometimes getting physical when I tried to get away from him. He'd accuse me of ruining his life and of being over dramatic (sometimes my panic attacks from being trapped in a house and constantly yelled at would result in self harm. Not on purpose and I didn't want to do it) even just for crying. He would disappear for an entire day (we lived together) without any contact, and when I'd call his work to see if he came in, or check up at his usual bar he'd accuse me of stalking him and controlling him. I just wanted to know he was alive. \n\nThings kept getting worse until I was legitimately afraid for my safety around him, and honestly just with myself, and I ended up in a psych ward for a week because I nearly slit my wrists. I didn't even mean to, but in the midst of hysteria during a fight I instinctively grabbed a knife and turned it on myself. Of course he turned into the perfect boyfriend again for that week, and a few days after. He would visit and call me regularly (more contact than he'd give me when we were living together), bring me things from the house to help me feel more comfortable, show me pictures of our cats... He even didn't touch a substance for the whole time I was in there. But when I was out, everything went back to how it was. \n\nI ended up leaving him, taking my cats, and basically cutting off contact. We'd meet up to go over some details about how to manage bills and contacting the landlord since I was on the lease, but that was it. Then I accidentally met a girl he started hooking up with due to loneliness. We hit it off, and I told her what happened between us. She confronted him, and he told her I raped him. Which is false. He twisted an actual sexual encounter we had to make it look like I took advantage of him and forced him into something he didn't want. Suddently I start getting harassed by this girl and her friend, calling me a rapist and saying she doesn't feel bad about what happened to me knowing that I'm a monster.\n\nHe recently hit is rock bottom and is finally asking for help. He's starting to act like himself again, which makes me so happy! But I don't think I can ever move past everything we went through, even though it had been prefaced by the most fantastic years of my life.\n\nIf your bf starts spiralling, you're going to want to support him, help him, show him you love him. But you have to make sure you're taking care of yourself, too. I didn't, and I'm really fucked up for it. Something I kept telling myself was \"this rough patch is nothing compared to the years of good.\" But then I realized - how much longer will this go on, how much more abuse will I take, before this \"rough patch\" lasts longer than the good part of our relarionship did. After a year of that abuse I realized I needed to leave before that fear became a reality. If your relationship starts to suffer, take a step back and support him as a friend. You're suffering, too, and that needs addressing. Don't let the good years go to waste by ruining them with bad ones. My ex is definitely proof that issues can be overcome, but staying together then has ruined any possibility of us being happy together again now.\n\nSorry for the rant, I don't want to scare you into breaking up with him or anything. I still love my ex and now that he's recovering we're talking again. But I don't want you to go through the same thing. Your bf is willibg to get help now, which leads me to believe your situation will end much more positively than mine. Just take care of yourself :)",

                            "comment": "Two ideas. Armchair psychology, so take it with a grain of salt :p\n\nFirstly, regarding \"too forgiving\": Yes, there is an imbalance in your relationship, when in comes to emotional stability. At least for the grieving period, perhaps afterwards. But that is not a dealbreaker, it can work. If it was a financial imbalance (one partner making a good bit more than the other) it can work fine. So can this.\n\nOf course any sort of imbalance makes things trickier than none, and especially an emotional one. But then, I think the very important bit is that you remained surprisingly calm throughout this. You did not know what was going on, did not understand the reactions you were getting, but you seemed rather clear about your own actions, and what your options were. Yes, you asked anonymous internet strangers for help, but see it this way: You started doubting yourself, but at the same time you still were sufficiently certain about your own morality and about being able to handle anonymous feedback that you dared making that step. Bit of weakness, but a good deal of strength in that.\n\nAs long as you have that kind of strength, the real risk here - the one of self-delusion and manipulation - is low. And that is the important bit, more relevant than imbalance.\n\nSecondly, regarding \"grief isn\u2019t an excuse to act out but in a sense, it is\": There are two aspects to \"blame\" that we often mix. The mechanical one of \"who/what caused (a bad thing to happen)\". And there is the question of morality: Who/What is at fault / needs to be fixed / needs to change / needs to be punished. For immaterial objects the two aspects align, for people they can differ. In your case I'd phrase it this way: Grief is a reasonable, and understandable cause for his behaviour (first aspect). But is that an excuse in the morality sense? Did he have a \"right\" to behave the way he did? Probably not. Should he be punished? No, but he should work on behaving better in the future. Do you have a right to end this relationship? Yes, even if that is a form of punishment. Does he have a \"right\" to put a good deal of blame on the sister? Yes. Does he have a \"right\" to make that argument as an excuse for the behaviour between the two of you? No.\n\nIf these answers seem contradictory, it is because they are. Morality on these issues is one large grey area. Moving forward, the important bit is communicating the extends of the grey area, and if you are making choices somewhere in this grey area, make it clear that you see it as a choice. In contrast to it being forced by morality in some sense. There is no need to color the map of behaviour in black and white; but communicating the rough edges of grey areas is important.\n\nHope it helps and good luck. Not implying that you need luck, but then, we all do.",

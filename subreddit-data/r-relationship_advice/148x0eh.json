    "postText": "So a few months back I was using dating apps and going on a lot of first dates, and eventually found someone I had good chemistry with and ended up going on a few more dates with. Around this time a friend of mine told me one of her friends was interested in me and asked if she could give her my number, which I agreed to because I was not yet exclusive with the woman I\u2019d been on multiple dates with. I started texting her over a period of a couple weeks, and around that time the woman I\u2019d be seeing asked to be exclusive, and I agreed. \n\nThis other woman a couple days later asked if I wanted to go on a date sometime, to which I told her i think she\u2019s great but I just became exclusive with someone and couldn\u2019t go out with her. I apologized for the misunderstanding, to which she didn\u2019t respond and instead just sent an 8 ball request. Obviously she wasn\u2019t happy about it, but it has been  like 3-4 months since then. I recently ended things with the woman I\u2019d been seeing instead, and I still find myself interested in the other woman. I know a lot of people will say it\u2019s a loss cause and to just not even try. But I\u2019ve already decided I\u2019m going to text her just in case she\u2019s willing to give me another shot. At the time, I\u2019d made it clear I was only turning her down because I was seeing someone else, and that there was nothing wrong with her. My question is how should I best approach this? What should I say to her? Should I text the friend who introduced me to her first and she if she\u2019d even want to hear from me?\nThanks!\n\nTL;DR: turned down a date with a woman I\u2019d been talking that our mutual friend set me up with because another woman id been on a several dates with asked to be exclusive. The woman who I turned down didn\u2019t seem to take it well (responded to my gentle letdown with 8 ball pool). Months later I ended things with the woman I\u2019d been seeing and now want to see if the woman I\u2019d turned down will give me another chance. At the time, I\u2019d made it clear I was only turning her down because I was seeing someone else, and that there was nothing wrong with her. How should I approach the situation? What should I say?",

Ask her and see what she thinks. Ask her if she wants to go on a date, and then see what she says. If she doesn\u2019t then move along, if she does then go wild.",

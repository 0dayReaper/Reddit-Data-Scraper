    "postText": "\nTLDR: having my first (gay) crush and don\u2019t know how to navigate.\n\nI have been talking to a girl everyday for half a month. I genuinely think she\u2019s the first person I\u2019ve ever had a crush on. All my previous partners and crushes were just fleeting fixations I had and never really connected with them on any deeper level. Those relationships would never end well either, I\u2019d get eventually get bored or lazy. I\u2019d purposely not return texts, calls, follow up with plans and even flat out avoid them. But with this girl, I usually text her first and we talk for hours. I wake up early just to see if she\u2019s sent me anything and I get all giddy and happy whenever she replies.\n\nMe and her are similar in a lot of ways, one of which is how much we enjoy our free time. I\u2019ve complained to her in person about how much I loathed my last relationship and felt like I had no time to myself. She completely agreed with me and said that\u2019s how she felt in her last relationship. So if I\u2019m spending so much of my free time talking to her and she is too that must mean something, right? We\u2019re both girls, so it\u2019s kinda hard telling whether this just a \u201cgirl friends\u201d thing if \u201cgirlfriend\u201d thing. She did say she was into women and wasn\u2019t really into guys (yippee!) but that doesn\u2019t mean she necessarily likes me. \n\nAnother problem is she has a boyfriend, but only because she felt awkward rejecting him. She\u2019s kind of a people pleaser and so when a friend of hers confessed to her (like a week and a half ago) she felt awkward rejecting him. She tells me how much she wants out and how she never replies to any of his texts or snaps and how she makes excuse after excuse to not hang out with him. I\u2019m pretty sure she texts me way more than her own boyfriend.\n\nWe text day and night and we were already kinda close before summer started. We even have a collaborative vocaloid playlist so we\u2019re basically married right?? Just can\u2019t tell if we\u2019re just really good friends or if she reciprocates. Neither of us really flirt just cause we\u2019re kinda uncomfy with that sorta stuff. Help, she consumes all my thoughts!!\n\nEDIT: they broke up lmao",

You're chatting with this girl like it's an Olympic sport, you're loving it and that's great. But listen, things can get messy, fast.\n\n  \nShe's got a guy she doesn\u2019t want, yet she's not cutting him loose. Warning bells should be ringing! She's gotta sort that situation before anything else.\n\n  \nNow, plot twist: they've broken up. But don't get your hopes up too fast. She needs time to process, and you don't wanna be the rebound.\n\n  \nHere's your next move: come clean. Tell her you've got feelings for her. It\u2019s gonna be terrifying, but hey, no guts, no glory, right? If she's into you, amazing. If not, it's gonna sting, but you'll get over it. What's important is that you won't be stuck wondering \"what if?\"\n\n  \nFinal piece of advice: You can't live in the 'maybe' lane. Either she's in or she's out. You deserve someone who\u2019s all in, just like you. Now go out there and seize the day, kid. And remember, no matter what happens, you'll be just fine. Good luck!",

    "postText": "OG post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hxyq72/my_best_friend_wants_me_to_work_with_my_rapist_on/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share \n\n\nFirst of all, thank you so much for the support on my first post. I did not expect it to gain that much attention. I guess a lot happened since then? I don't know if it's even been a week yet. But this is going to change my life, perhaps for the better.\n\nThere were hundreds of comments, and I'd thought I'd address a few questions regarding the rape itself. I don't appreciate how some of these were asked, but I'll share anyway for the sake of clarifying things.\n\n1. Was I under the influence? Yes, but I remember vividly saying no. I was drunk enough to have all my strength and mobility wonky but I didn't black out or anything. The force he used on me didn't seem that of someone who was drunk, he looked completely sober, but I could be wrong. I remember a couple of times when I was trying to lift myself off the bed and he would push me back down, I remember the expression on his face. Like you guys said, I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.That's all I'm willing to share for now, the only person who knows all the details is Tina. Is it bad that I wish she knew nothing now? Maybe it would hurt less.\n\n2. Why didn't I report it? Because I saw how that turned out for other girls I knew. I've had a few other friends (not Tina) who have had the same thing happen to them and nothing came out of reporting it, and it made them feel worse. Just the few comments calling me a liar stung, so I can't imagine how I would have felt back as my unstable teen self. Not only that, I was scared of what Rod would do if he found out I had reported him. There was just something about him that made me never want to cross him.\n\nReading all your comments, it seems pretty clear that how Tina was treating me was extremely inconsiderate and I should find a new friend. Although it was a huge slap in the face, I came to my senses and believed that I couldn't be around someone who would do that to me. Some of you said to expose them during vows, but that's just not the kind of person I am, and it might not turn out well. A few of you gave me example texts I could send which I am extremely thankful for, but I decided to send this.\n\n\"I've had time to think about it, and I just can't be your maid of honor anymore. It's so hurtful that you are telling me to pack up my trauma for who knows how long until your wedding day.I just can't do it. I don't think I will come at all knowing that he's going to be there. I'm sorry.\"\n\nIt's pretty weak, but it's probably the \"meanest\" text I've ever sent. An hour later, I get a call from Josh. He asked me what was going on with me and Tina, and that she was extremely upset. A part of me snapped and I said \"I don't know, what's going on with you making someone who raped me best man?\" I don't usually blurt things out like that. He was confused and I repeated myself. He was silent for a few seconds and then asked if he could come over. I was a little wary of the idea but I said sure.(I know, we should be social distancing but this really needed to be discussed.)\n\nHe comes to my apartment 40 minutes later without Tina. I have never hung out with Josh one on one before, it was always with Tina. Josh always had a really cute and sweet personality, and I've always approved of him when it came to dating her. He was really only a friendly acquaintance to me though.\n\nWe sat down and spoke for over an hour.\n\nTina had told Josh that the reason I wasn't coming to the wedding was that I didn't want to work with Rod...BECAUSE I HAD A CRUSH ON HIM...and thought she was forcing the relationship too much. So basically, she said we had a petty girl fight. My jaw hit the floor and I was fuming. She had obviously never told Josh what Rod did to me. I shared that Rod had raped me back in high school, and that Tina knew about it. I asked if he knew too.\n\nHe said he didn't, but at one point Rod did mention that a few \"crazy bitches\" falsely accused him of rape senior year. This obviously didn't include me, since I only told Tina and a few family members.. Josh believed him at the time, but I guess after hearing ME say it it's starting to dawn on him that his friend was a liar.\n\nHere's something that I didn't expect...Josh shared with me that he was raped when he was a kid by an older brother of a friend he had. He said that if he was forced to work with said brother on a wedding, he would absolutely refuse. He apologized heavily on behalf of Tina, but I won't forgive unless she says it herself. \n\nI know some of you may think Josh is lying, but I believe him. \n\nI could see it by Josh's face and body language that the realization really weighed down on him, and I felt bad. In a way, we were both going through a betrayal. I asked if he was ok to go home, and he said yes. He thanked me for telling him and left. I don't know if I'll stay in touch with him, but I was beyond furious with Tina at this point. \n\nI was expecting an angry text coming from her, and sure enough, I got it at like midnight. She went off saying that I'm gonna end up destroying their marriage, how could I do that to her, etc etc. I just pressed the block button and went to bed. Quickest decision ever made.\n\nI'm feeling a little down in the dumps right now, yet slightly relieved. I'm going to try to connect with other friends and try to move on from this. If I'm feeling brave enough, I might try to find these \"crazy bitches\" and see if we can make a case against Rod. Knowing that there are other victims makes me feel so guilty I want to scream. Sorry it's not too happy of an ending, but I think it might have been more unhappy if I decided to go along with it. Thank you Reddit.",

You should stay in touch with him, especially since it sounds like in the reckoning with Josh and Tina he\u2019s going to have to clean house, ending toxic friendships. There may be pressure on him to rugsweep so hearing a voice of reason like yours may be a help.\n\nTina doesn\u2019t deserve him, nor does she deserve your friendship. She\u2019s a liar and betrayer. She chose to protect a rapist, all \u201cto not make waves\u201d. It wasn\u2019t like her fianc\u00e9 was pressuring her to include Rod, knowing everything \u2014 she made the executive decision to hide the rape and lie about why you backed out of the wedding. Terrible!",

She wanted her day to be 'perfect' so she asked OP this 'favor' and I think she didn't tell Josh the real reason OP refused because she knew (or at least expected) how he would feel about it as a survivor himself. She probably just wanted to fix this 'problem' quickly in private with OP and just get it out of the way and sweep it under the rug so she could go on with her perfect day. Really faulty logic and thinking, if that's the case. But I can't think of another reason for her lying about their fight to Josh other than knowing rape is a sensitive issue for him. Or she just knew Josh is a better person than her in general lol, because ofc you don't have to be raped to know it's evil and disgusting.",

It's fucking traumatizing and it stays with you. Even years later the first time running into my almost rapist I was on the verge of a panic attack. It was surprising how much just seeing this person affected me.",

If she had protested rod Being in the wedding she would have had to explain why she didn\u2019t say anything sooner. The reason is because she didn\u2019t have a problem with rod.

As you know from personal experience it is not easy to discuss being sexual assaulted. Now if as a woman it is hard for you imagine how hard it was for Josh to admit. That means he really trusts you and despite never having a friendship outside of Tina he values you in some way. I think that is a friendship worth preserving even if at a distance.\n\nIf their marriage falls a part before it begins that means he is seeing Tina in a new light and not one that he approves of. He is seeing a part of her that is revolting and not something you'd want in a partner. That is in no way your fault or your problem and you would not be to blame.\n\nStay strong OP and I hope you keep the door open for a friendship with him. Best wishes. :)",

I had people ask me why I didn't go to the police (a lot of reasons which mainly come down to the location I was in, but I did go to someone I thought could help me and all I heard/was threatened with was that I needed to think harder about what I was \"actually saying\"), because \"What if he does it to someone else?\"\n\nHere's the thing: looking back, I'm almost positive he already had. He was far too confident in what he did to me, and knew exactly how to get me alone. He knew his position of power, how isolated I was geographically, and how few resources there were for me. Turns out I was right and it wasn't his first sick rodeo, but I don't blame his other victims,. It wasn't their job to play 'catch a predator.' Rape isn't some twisted golden ticket where now it's on you to put a stop to this persons behavior.\n\nSo few rapes are ever prosecuted in the U.S. and even less result in a sentence that leads to any jail time. Yet, every single survivor has been called a lair at least once (statistically, the number of false reports is ridiculously low), had their actions scrutinized before, during, and after the assault, and had to replay the trauma in front of what is essentially an audience of people that include those seeking to judge.\n\nTina's behavior is abhorrent and hope that you find a better friend to place your trust in. You're a strong individual and none of this is your fault.",

It wasn\u2019t just this but it was everything. \n\nI have removed them out of my life... (actual all my cousins, aunts and uncles..) all of them were toxic. I thought I was the problem.

And my sister is friends with an abusive ex boyfriend of mine and would constantly tell me he was invited to the wedding. While he wasn\u2019t the one that raped me, it was a very controlling relationship. I was 15-16, he was 18-19. She knows everything he did to me, and saw me go through it in real time. I begged her not to invite him and she kept flip flopping to the point where I had to come out to my dad about the abuse I went through. The shame was so heavy I will never forget how it felt to see my dad\u2019s face when I told him everything. Eventually my dad told her we wouldn\u2019t go if my abuser went and he didn\u2019t go, but fuck I got drunk because another man that preyed in me as a teen was there (she has shit friends). I\u2019m so fucking sorry, dude. Sending you hugs. Fuck Tina",

Things are going to get so much better; the hardest part's already over. You deserve a world of healing, love, and blessings. Best wishes.",

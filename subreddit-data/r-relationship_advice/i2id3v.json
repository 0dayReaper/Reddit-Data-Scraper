    "postText": "Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hy4vqw/i_38m_just_found_out_that_my_brother_19m_has_been/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\nThis update was long overdue so I apologize to everyone who waited for this. I've had daily messages asking me about what happened and now that I'm in a better place to actually talk about it, I can tell everyone about what happened. \n\nFirst of all, thank you to the redditors who pointed out that I should tell my wife first before confronting my brother. You were right, she did appreciate the fact that I gave her control over the situation. \n\nI told my wife the next day after posting and needless to say, she did not take it well. She says she feels violated and unsafe in her own home. See, the thing is my wife and I have been together for almost 15 years so we literally saw this kid grow up. We took him out to the movies, to the beach, etc. We sometimes even joked to my parents that he was our practice baby. My wife has a tendency to distrust people in general, as a lot of people in her life have let her down in the past. Imagine how hurt and betrayed she was when she found out someone she trusted and loved dearly betrayed her like that. Honestly, if I wasn't consoling my wife then, I probably would've gone through with the initial idea and beat the ever living crap out of my brother. \n\nAfter she calmed down and went to sleep, I called my sister and talked about the situation. My sister and I are close, given that we're Irish Twins. I feel like she needed to know cause she has 2 teenage daughters herself and who knows what my brother would do to them if given the chance. We talked and she was clearly mad. She loves my wife like a sister and they're quite close themselves. She said she would support whatever decision we make and that our brother would also be unwelcome at her place for the foreseeable future. \n\nThen we confronted my brother. At first he denied it but when I showed him the evidence, he started ugly crying and begging us to forgive him. I gave him an ultimatum... Either he lets me in his phone laptop and delete everything, or I call the police. There was so much more shit on his computer than I initially thought. So many more stolen pictures of my wife that we're definitely taken without consent. The fucker even recorded the audio of us having sex. Who does that? So after hours of me looking for as much shit as possible, and pretty much clearing most of his hard drive, he eventually left without much of a fight. Oh and we definitely threw out my wife's defiled underwear and are most likely going to have the room he stayed in cleaned professionally. \n\nI checked and thankfully he didn't have any hidden cameras anywhere. Oh and if you're wondering how he got pictures of my wife in a towel... The shower for the masters doesn't have hot water yet so my wife uses the shared one in the same area. She would usually walk out of the bathroom with just a towel on and go change in our walk in closet. This shouldn't have been a problem cause the guest bedroom was in a different part of the house far from the main bedrooms and it had its own bathroom so my brother had no reason for being there. \n\nNeedless to say, my wife is still shaken up about the whole thing, which is why I didn't think about writing an update until now. I'm sorry but my wife's well-being is my priority above anything else. \n\nMy mom eventually called me asking what happened. She seemed very confused so I figured my brother didn't tell her anything at all. I told her what happened and needless to say, it did not end well. She kept asking me to forgive my brother and take him back in. She ranted about how difficult it would be to support him and how what I'm doing is breaking the family apart. I let her talk till I eventually said my brother would no longer be welcome in my home. I told her that she needed to get him therapy and that until then, there's no chance we would ever see him. My mom told me she'd talk to my sister about it and I said... Good luck, she's mad at him too. \n\nNot sure what's going to happen to our family now. The reason why we got the big house was cause we wanted everyone to come over during the holidays and stay with us but Im not sure if my parents will at this point and there's no chance my brother is ever coming back anytime soon. Thankfully my sister is 100% on my side and we're going to talk about what we're doing for Thanksgiving soon. \n\nMy wife hasnt really been the same either but she's getting better now that my brother is gone. We're talking about therapy which is something she's very willing to try out. We took a drive to the beach earlier (chill guys, we didn't leave the car) and talked about the future. We both agreed that after this whole covid thing is over, we're going to finally start our family with kids. We want two. Being a mom is something she always wanted but we both wanted to be financially secure enough to give them a good life and for us to also be in a position where we didn't have to work so much and just spend time with them. The sparkle in her eyes when we talked about our life together with kids told me that while things arent good right now, we're going to be ok. \n\nI honestly can't wait to be a dad myself. \n\nSo yeah, long story short brother is gone, wife is still sad, sister is on my side but mom isn't and I'm going to be a dad in a few years. \n\nThanks to everyone who gave me their advice. It honestly helped me clear my head and make the right decision to tell my wife first. \n\nOh and to answer questions that may come up... \n\nNo, we did not go to the police. My brother deleted everything voluntarily and left without a trace. I'm sure the pictures are still out there somewhere but thankfully they aren't too explicit that it would severely damage my wife's reputation. \n\nAnd no, we aren't going to try and get pregnant or anything like that. We plan on adopting which is something we both talked about early on. \n\nSo again, thanks to everyone who messaged and commented. I may not have read everything nor have I replied to everyone but rest assured you are all greatly appreciated.",

It's actually pretty big issue in forensics - unless you're deleting GB of data when you delete a file - it's gone for good in a few minutes.\n\nThings are different with memory cards, flash drives and so on - especially on the older ones data can sit there for years if the drive was never totally filled.",

The way DRAM works (the most common RAM in your computer) is basically a huge amount of very small capacitors. Freezing the memory allows these capacitors to retain their state for a long time even when disconnected from power. They can then take these frozen memory modules, connect them to a different computer and dump the contents. They can then use this dump to look for things like encryption keys that were being stored in RAM for active use. If your hard drive was fully encrypted this would allow them to decrypt it without needing to know the password.",

It is simple and very useful for finding all the devices attached to your network (wifi or wired).\n\nhttps://www.fing.com/\n\nEdit: for OP, he'd be already signed into his home wifi, so all he'd have to do is install the app on his phone, give it permissions and then run the \"scan for devices\" to see all the devices attached to his network. If his brother left an IP camera attached to the network to perv, then OP could easily see it with fing. Even if he had a hard time finding the physical device, fing would give him the IP address of the camera and allow him to block it from the router... Thus prohibiting the brother from continued perving.",

The second one got him beaten up by the girl's cousin, and his mom promptly packed up him and his brother and moved them out of state.\n\nWhen he'd started at our school a few months prior, it was because they suddenly moved to our area from a different state. Given what I saw of his mom and the rules she had at their house, I've always suspected that this was basically their MO: teen son rapes a girl and, when it looks like he'll get reported, mom up and moves them rather than have him face consequences.",

My friend Derek's older brother Rob used to bully kids and do messed up stuff when we were younger. One time he started hitting our other friend Ben's new bike with a baseball bat, so I basically went off on him and broke his nose. He went home crying to his mom, who came to my house and said to never lay a hand on her child again, even after I explained that he had literally tried to destroy Ben's $300 bike for absolutely no reason. I get that violence wasn't the answer, but to basically not apologize or offer to pay for any damages is really shitty. Especially when he was like 3 years older than us.",

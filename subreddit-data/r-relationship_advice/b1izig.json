    "postText": "Hello guys. Im providing an update to my earlier post \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b0h9as/i_28m_is_about_to_propose_to_my_gf_28f_of_7_years/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app\n\nI dont think there is a need for me to see her again next week. So here\u2019s what happened. \n\n-She texted me she got home and about to sleep at 11:44 PM (she\u2019s closing deals in another city and has to rent a place)\n\n-I tried to facetime her 11:51 PM just to say goodnight, she didn\u2019t pick up. I tried messaging her but no response. \n\nRemember that spare phone that\u2019s with me where her google account is logged in? I browsed on her activity history quickly to find out what shes up to, and was surprised there\u2019s a \u201cgoogle assistant\u201d command recorded at 11:48 PM.\n\nI played and listened. There\u2019s her voice and a voice of another guy. They were goofing around at the google home device. So yeah. \n\nI confronted her and barraged her with a lot of messages, she only replied at around 1 AM.  She kept on denying she\u2019s cheating.\n\nThen I laid all the evidences, all the screencaps and even the audio clip recording from the google assistant. \n\nShe finally admitted. \n\nI am single. \n\n",

They don\u2019t realize how insane their denials sound. It must be tough admitting out loud to being a scumbag.",

I\u2019m not a man that\u2019s in high demand and I\u2019ve had women in relationships proposition me several times, it was never my idea. I fooled around with one of them when I was 20, was way too young and horny to say no even though I refused to go all the way until she broke up with her boyfriend. She ended up telling him and then attempting to fool around multiple times after that while still dating the same guy!\n\nThat was just the first. It disturbed me enough that I refused the offers I got from multiple different women later on. I\u2019ve probably had more offers from women in relationships than single women, I\u2019ve had to work hard to get single women.\n\nI kind of wish I was never in those situations because it makes it really hard for me to trust women now.\n\nForgot to mention my own mother was disloyal and destroyed our family. She suddenly divorced my dad, turned all of our lives upside down. After 3 months she tells me some guy she met online is moving in with us. At first I thought wow she\u2019s lost her mind and is moving way too fast. Then my brother tells me a few months before the divorce he went on the family computer and saw she was having raunchy chats with some guy online, he had no idea how to react and kept it to himself.\n\nI mean guys cheat too, but women are just so good at lying and tend to leapfrog relationships instead of ending them, being single for a time and finding someone new. They\u2019re way more likely to line up a new guy while still in a relationship. I hate to say all this and it\u2019s just my own personal experience but it\u2019s really altered my faith in women sadly.",

It is because in the ancestral past in which we evolved, the world was very dangerous and women without a stronger man around were at a huge risk of death.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've had the same experience.  The most startling was a few years ago.  I had to work alone on the road, in a rural area, with a young, married woman that is the definition of \"good and wholesome\".  She married her college BF and recently had her first baby.  Her husband is a very small guy, shorter than her.  I'm tall and fit.  Those three days, we talked non-stop and I think I was more charming than usual (which was brought out of me due to obvious mutual attraction).  At the end of the last day, she propositioned me for sex (as we were driving by somewhere we both knew we could drive off to and not be interrupted).  While she did it, her face was flush, she had that super horny look, and she was literally grinding her crotch into the passenger seat. I turned her down because I didn't want to destroy her life and hurt my career.  I was very tempted though.  That incident still bothers me.",

I'm glad I blew through those shitty years to make it to where I am now.",

            "comment": "I had such a similar situation to your original post. We were already married, though. After dating for over three years and at eight months in to the marriage, everything went wrong in one day. It was very much like my wife had died and she had been replaced with a doppleganger who was her polar opposite. I married her after having been her two children's stepfather for four years. The younger one had no real memory of anyone else other than me as her dad. I filed for divorce, but she later tried to come back home after our separation. I gave it the full six months, but she would never tell me what she had done while she was gone, and I couldn't live the rest of my life with her with so many unknowns.\n\nI mourned that relationship as if she had died. Stages of grief. The whole thing. It was so sudden and jarring. That was in 2014. Now I have no wife, no children, and the home I bought for us has been sold.\n\nI don't understand how these things happen. I knew she had cheated on me, but I had no proof. I had no smoking gun. Until last October. When I decided to look at her new man's Facebook page. All he had visible to non-friends were his profile pics. As I scrolled down, I saw many pictures of him and her.\n\nBut the piece de resistance was a picture of him, of her, and of both of my children -- all taking a selfie. The date the picture was posted? The same day she called me and asked to come home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry this happened to you, that it happens to anybody, really. Because it fucks with your sense of self-worth, but it also ruins the way you see any other potential partners. It makes you wonder what's so wrong with you that you didn't see it coming. (Or maybe that's just me.) Anyway, you've done the right thing. Hang tight, friend. You'll get to the other side.\n\nEDIT: typos, edited for clarity and for other people's reading comprehension failures.",

If you're a FB user and post a lot on there, put it out, \"Newly single as ex cheated. I was getting ready to propose.\". Don't bad mouth her or call her names, just do not sugar coat what she did. Do NOT be embarrassed about this, you have done *nothing* wrong. It's all on her. If anyone is doubtful, show them the files you have. Since you've been together so long you probably have a lot of common friends. If you're out with them and she shows up, just don't talk with her, if she tries to approach you just ask her to leave you alone, you have nothing to say to her and you don't want to hear anything from her. She's made her bed.\n\nThis is going to be emotionally difficult, as seven years is a long time, so you might look into counseling to help you get through this. With the time you would normally spend with her, find something else todo. Maybe a group activity you've wanted to try but never had the time. Now you do. \n\nTake care dude.

    "postText": "I moved 4 hours away from home when I was 18 to go to college. I\u2019m now 27F with a 34M husband and a toddler. \n\nMy mom was diagnosed with stage 4 renal cell carcinoma almost 4 years ago, 5 year survival rates are 12% and were even less when she was diagnosed. Despite this, she had always seemed positive. She\u2019s been getting great treatment, even though it makes her feel terrible. Last week she told me she is ready to die and doesn\u2019t want treatment anymore because her quality of life is terrible. I want to move home whether that be temporarily or permanently. I just hate being away - it is so hard. 4 hours doesn\u2019t seem long but I have to pack up my whole house for my son. It literally takes a whole day. He hates his car seat and screams the entire car ride there and back.  My husband does nothing to help with this trip and we always end up fighting. Watching him at my parent\u2019s house is not fun. My husband has a great job in our current city with a great family and group of friends. I can understand why he doesn\u2019t want to move. I get it, but I\u2019ve lived in his hometown with him for so long in a place that I don\u2019t particularly love. I feel like he should be willing to do this for me after all I\u2019ve done for him.\n\nI\u2019m just so upset thinking about how I\u2019ll never get to just meet my mom for lunch on a Tuesday because we live in the same place. Or she can never just swing by to see her grandson. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve always told my husband I want to move home one day and now he is completely against it. I feel so isolated here and I just want to be near my family. He says if we move he will be isolated there.",

This is very selfish on his end, regardless of how difficult it will be with your toddler. You and your mom deserve to be together during this hard time. Whether he is isolated or not, if this were my partner, I would suck it up and go for their sake. I would never want them to resent me or live a life of regret that they didn't get to spend their mom's final moments together. I wouldn't back down on this, you deserve to be with her.",

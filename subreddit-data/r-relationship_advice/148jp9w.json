    "postText": "Husband (36M)  has always had a porn addiction.   Now I call it an addiction because he is so desensitized he can no longer get off with me (32F)  Within 5 years of our marriage he told me I needed to either get a boob job or he'd have to divorce me. Naturally C cup boobs would never make him happy.  So I got the Boob job.  Immediately after he was angry because they weren't big enough.  We have now been married 13 years and it's been constant lying.  I am in decent shape I take care of myself. I dont feel like most men would find me undesirable.  My husband back in the craigslist days was caught using my nudes looking for sex.  Which was super confusing.  We have 5 kids, a home, a buisness and I do love him.  However, I am so lonely.  Sex is mentally painful for me.  I dont feel sexy or comfortable with him anymore.  I will never be the big titted milf he constantly watches.  I've gone as far as telling him he is free to do what he wants Im just tired of the secrets.  If he wants to seek sex elswhere or talk to someone else for enjoyment but PLEASE NO MORE LYING.  He still hid things and lied.  Im at a loss.  How to I numb these feeling? I feel to stuck to leave. He really is my Best Friend. He just constantly hurts me.   Im not sure what Im looking for here. Advice?  encouragement? maybe I just needed to vent.  Can this be salavaged?  Can I ever get passed this and feel sexy and desirable?  \nJust a lonely house wife who feels like she has gone above and beyond to please a man and in the process lost herself.",

            "comment": "You may view him as your best friend but I'm willing to bet he views you as a roommate he can use like a sex toy while he thinks about porn. Sorry that's harsh, but it needs to be. He fundamentally DOES NOT CARE about you the way that you care about him. If he did he wouldn't do the things he does that hurts you. But at this point he's learned that he can have his porn addiction, treat you like a piece of meat, and you won't leave because you're in love with this version of him that's only the good parts. That version doesn't exist and is not who he is \"deep down\" or anything like that. He's a deeply broken porn addict who's willing to emotionally hurt his wife to feed that addiction. \n\nTo be frank I think the only thing that would have a shot in hell to fix this is for him to realize you're leaving. And even that is likely temporary change just to make you stay. I'd recommend that in moments where you feel hurt, angry, betrayed - take that energy and put it into developing your exit plan. That same energy you used to write this post. Contact a lawyer, therapist, look for housing - start to imagine a life where you aren't constantly pitted against his addiction. I think you'll be surprised at how freeing that life could be. Best of luck.",

He promised to be better, admitted to his addiction, begged for help.....  you know  the whole 9 yards.  Ya, that didn't last long.  I really am just tired of babysitting my husband.  Even if he received help PORN is a HARD addiction to break. And I honestly dont think Im even up to going down that road with him.  I can't monitor him and always make sure he's staying on track.  It's exhausting. Im exhausted!  The things said to me and done to me  throughout the marriage haunt me.   I try to avoid it, but they creep up, and I break.  Put myself back together and just press forward.  Its a vicious cycle I just wish leaving was easier.",

Can you imagine your life ten years from now, if you stay? That is a very long time to live without sex or intimacy or appreciation. If you go there's a tremendous amount of loneliness. Learning how to make decisions all by yourself is harder than expected. While you take the time to make this decision, become a stronger person, take care of yourself, protect yourself, stay connected to your children, and above all respect yourself, because whether you stay or go, you will need to do all of these things to have a good life.  All the best to you.\nP.S. I think you are underestimating your value and overestimating his worth, giving him power you need  keep for yourself.",

You need to think long and hard if you want to waste the next 13 + years of your life with someone who doesn't love and appreciate you for who you are. The boob job issue would be a deal breaker for a lot of people. Then the nudes on craigslist thing??\n\nYou are way too young to waste anymore time with this guy. It's also going to teach your kids to treat their relationships like this, boys will learn to treat their partners like this, girls will think it's normal to be treated this way.",

Life happens, kids come along, happy times, unhappy times, the spark gets lost. It takes both sides wanting to keep the relationship going for it to work among other things!! He needs to respect you and he certainly doesn\u2019t respect you because if he did he wouldn\u2019t be hurting you the way he is. He wouldn\u2019t leave you wondering why you aren\u2019t enough!! \n\nYou deserve someone who loves you for exactly who you are, on the inside and on the outside! As we age, our bodies don\u2019t always look like they did when we were younger. I\u2019m 35 almost 36 and I def don\u2019t look the same as I did 5 even 10 years ago. My boyfriend told me I\u2019m getting better with age (and he means it in the best way possible!) I was always super skinny (I\u2019m a recovering addict and alcoholic) and now being clean and sober I\u2019ve gained some weight, so my boobs and my butt got bigger and he likes me the way I am. I did have someone on Easter Sunday ask me if I was pregnant and I told her no, that I was just fat lol! But she\u2019s not my partner! My boyfriend is and what he thinks of me is what matters to me! He tells me constantly that I\u2019m beautiful, hot, sexy etc. we had lost our spark before and were living like an old married couple. Now we have our spark back. I\u2019ve been struggling with my self esteem and confidence since 2020 when I had my top teeth taken out to get a denture and my dentist didn\u2019t listen to me and I now have a denture I can\u2019t wear that sits in the medicine cabinet. \n\nYou deserve better!! You are worthy of someone loving you unconditionally and wholeheartedly. Someone who respects your feelings and won\u2019t lie to you. Who will be willing to communicate when things get hard in life and you need that person for support!! You are worthy of the whole packaged deal that comes with relationships!! Please don\u2019t stay because you are afraid to leave!! Lean on whoever you have as a support whether it be family or friends!! Hell, even us strangers on here are always here to help build you up and encourage you and to help you find your strength!! Good luck op!!",

There are many people looking for the same things as you, but you have to put yourself out there if it\u2019s what you really want.\n\nThis got a bit ramble-y, but I want to end with that you don\u2019t have to make up your mind right away. Take as much time is needed for you to decide. But it sounds like there\u2019s a decision to be made, because usually when these thoughts are eating away at us, it\u2019s for a good reason.",

            "comment": "This is heartbreaking to read..  I want you to understand that your husband's current state, and how his porn addiction is affecting him physically, is comparable to a drug addiction. His brain has become desensitized to normal sources of dopamine, such as everyday activities and regular intimacy. As a result, he may feel the need to seek more extreme situations/content to satisfy the dopamine cravings. In this state no matter what he asks of you, it won't cure his addiction and make him content or happy. It's crucial that you find support and show kindness to yourself after everything that has happened. Remember, you are enough as you are, and it's tragic to feel like you've lost yourself in his addiction.\n\nAt this point, it's important for you to process the pain you're experiencing. The lying and harmful behavior from him won't stop unless he genuinely wants to change and seek help. Even if he does have a change of heart, the healing process won't be linear unfortunately. I am currently going through betrayal trauma myself and figuring out how to heal with my partner and found [this resource](https://oceanrecoverycentre.com/2016/07/the-ultimate-guide-to-overcoming-internet-porn-addiction/) helpful to get a better understanding of porn addiction. I would also suggest checking out r/PornAddiction, which is a space for people trying to recover and their partners.\n\nI truly hope that you can rediscover yourself and learn to love yourself, despite the immense betrayal and pain you're facing. Remember, you are strong, and support from loved ones will be invaluable to you in this time.",

But when I looked at myself and what I needed to be happy and the model I wanted my kids to see, leaving was a no brainer. Divorce is scary but I am so much happier now. Alone or with someone else, you will find you are worth so much more and will be so much happier. I\u2019d also suggest counseling, it was beneficial to help move past some of the feelings you\u2019re describing and prepare for the mental step towards leaving. Whatever you decide, I hope you know you deserve better.",

It hurts, and it makes you question your own sanity at times. The main thing I learned was that you can't force him to change. He needs to see the problem and do the work. Nothing you will do or don't do will change that.\n\nYou are not the problem. You are not unattractive or undesirable. His addiction is his problem. You don't need to make it yours. Sit down and write out the pros and cons of your marriage and be honest. Don't stay unhappy for your kids. You deserve someone who makes you feel happy and who wakes up excited to see you. If he won't make the changes and fight his addiction, then he will never be that man for you.",

Nothing sexy about that. \nYou asked if it could be salvaged?

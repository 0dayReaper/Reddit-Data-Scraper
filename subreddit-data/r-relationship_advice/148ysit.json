    "postText": "For context, me and my boyfriend have been together for in total 8 years. We met between mutual friends while I was still in school and he had just moved to my town to go to college. We were friends for 2 years before we started dating. The reason for this was because 1,I was too scared to make a move and secondly, he was in love with one of our mutual friends. After she got a boyfriend, he moved on to liking me and we have been dating ever since. Last Saturday was his birthday and he told me he has never been thrown a surprise birthday party and would like to experience one. I worked all week before Saturday (his birthday), planning and inviting people, getting reservations, buying a cake, etc. I asked his best friend to hang out with him for most of the day so that I could set up and get everyone to get here and hide for the surprise. The birthday party was a success and he was smiling the whole time. He had snuck off with his best friend somewhere and I wanted to find him so that we could sing happy birthday and cut the cake. As I was walking down the hallway I heard him and his friend talking so I kept walking towards their voices. I heard him tell his friend that he should have kept trying with our mutual friend. He told him that he should have been the man that was engaged to her and not her now fianc\u00e9. He said that he hated waking up to me and that he wished that our mutual friend was the one that threw him his first surprise party. He said that he felt disgusted every time he had to kiss me or hold me because he knew that our mutual friend should be in his arms instead.He said that he felt like he was stuck in our relationship and that he would end up \"having\" to marry me. He said that our mutual friend was better than me in looks from head to toe, he said that \"she was the most gorgeous girl i've ever seen\". I went back to the party and told everyone that I couldn't find him and that we would have to wait for him to come back. When he came back, he gave me a hug and a kiss on the head and told me he loved me. I didn't want to ruin his party so I went along with it. He doesn't know that I know he doesn't honestly love me, I've just been going along with everything. I honestly don't want to break up with him, I just want to know how I can make him fall in love with me. I don't know what I did to make him feel so unhappy so I would like to know how do I make my boyfriend fall in love with me or should I just give up on our relationship? He is the first boyfriend I've ever had and I'm scared to start dating again at my age.",

And, I found out the worst way possible! Let\u2019s just say that I came home unexpectedly!\n\nI seriously thought I was going to die! We had been together since I was 18 - he was literally my best friend!! I swore that I would never get married again! I met a guy about a year later - he was totally different than my ex or anyone else I had ever gone out with. We became friends, he was great with my son (my ex had decided that he wasn\u2019t good for his image and had given up his rights)! So, we did this for a couple of years, we had never even kissed! And then out of nowhere he tells me that he Loves me and that he wants to marry me and adopt my son (that was the part that got me the most)!\n\nI found out how different it can be when your soulmate really is your true best friend!! February 1st we celebrated our 30 Year Anniversary! We have a couple of grandkids and my life is better than I ever could have imagined!\n\nWhen I was in Counseling, she said something that has stuck with me forever and I think that you OP will understand what I\u2019m saying:\nIt\u2019s hard being lonely when you\u2019re in a relationship, much better to be alone and at peace. Wishing you well in whatever happens. Just remember that you Are worth something and you deserve to be Loved, Respected, and Appreciated just for who YOU Are! \ud83e\udd0d",

This great catch who is apparently capable of lying shamelessly for 8 years so that he has regular sex, I suppose, and would leave her in a heartbeat for some other girl. Jesus Christ.\n\nGirl what you do is gather your stuff and leave. Immediately. Or kick him out, whichever works. And find someone who LOVES you. Who thinks you are the center of the universe. Who gets up in the morning to see you smile. Jesus, that's basic minimum requirements. You tell him to get fucked, then block him everywhere and go have a lovely life. 25 is NO age at all, it's ridiculously young! \n\nUgh..why aren't we teaching girls self-respect??",

But seeing that 'one that got away' engaged has clearly set off a lot of ugly resentment and self esteem issues on you, that he has apparently chosen to project at you. After all, if we take what he says literally he used you for 8 years and that makes him genuinely vile. At best he is just pathetic. \n\nAnd yeah, you can't unhear that. Whatever the truth of his feelings for you it is clear that he is still hung up on her and that will always be in the back of your mind. It just isn't worth it. \n\nBecause contrary to your assessment you are actually way too young to be putting up with this. Don't go signing up for a lifetime of insecurity with a guy pining like a loser for an idealised version of a highschool crush. You're only 25, this is the perfect time to go and find yourself a healthy adult relationship with someone that isn't stuck in the past. \n\nI'm sorry you heard that. I know it will be hard not to internalise. But this isn't about you, this is about him not knowing how to deal with his feelings and it coming out in a toxic and putrid way.",

If any other guy from your friend group, for whom you have no feelings, forces you to be with him , claiming he will make you love him , just imagine how would you feel. You would start hating him instead of feeling love. This is what happening to your relationship..\n\nAlso, most important thing, you can keep trying how much you want, but for him you are just a option now to not be lonely while pinning for that mutual friend. He might or might not get over her someday. But even after being with you for sometime he feels disgusted by your touch, he is not going to fall in love with you. He will fall for someone later on in future, someone who is like your mutual friend, and then will leave you as soon as possible. You are right now just waiting ticket for him, untill he can convince that mutual friend or can find someone like the mutual friend. \n\nWould you rather dump him now and get over him slowly so that can really find someone who will love you back, or get dumped by him later on and feel even more worse that he is choosing someone else over years of your relationship. At that point it will be much more difficult for you to move on. You only have these 2 options. The option which you want, that is making him fall in love with you , is not available. This is sure because he is disgusted by your touch, and feels like a chore to even kiss you. If he respected you even a little, I would still say there was a chance. If he had said, \" he is pinning for that mutual friend, but you are also not that bad\" then still there would be a chance he respects you at minimum level atleast. But his words signify that you are not and will never be an option for him. \n\nPlease love yourself as much as you love him and move on. He is not worth it.",

It hurts so so so much but you have to look out for your own best interest. 25 is not old at all, you have your whole life ahead of you! You deserve someone who loves and cherishes you. If he doesn't after 8 years, he just won't. Don't waste any more of your time on him. The sooner you come to terms with this, the sooner you start to heal and move on. It'll take time and effort and a lot of heartache but it'll be worth it when you find someone deserving of you! I sometimes give the advice to think about when you were little and thinking of the person you wanted to be with in the future, would it be someone who said and feels those things about you? No. Love yourself enough to let go and find someone who truly loves you and treats you right. Your happy future self will be so grateful you did! Hang in there, you got this!",

Even if you did everything right, he's not obliged to love you, it's only up to him and his feelings if he does or not. You now know he doesn't love you. He's still in love or some obsession with the romanticized image of girl that rejected him 8 years ago and you can't change it.\n\nIt's harsh, but you were just a band aid for his broken heart. I know that many people when rejected by a crush or just anyone, often quickly get together with the first easily available option, so they just have someone. At first it feels good, but later they realize they're unfulfilled and it just gets worse. \nHe might be with you out of guilt, you clearly love him and do so much for him, so he feels pressured to stay in a relationship, so he isn't considered ungrateful.\n\nIt's not worth staying in such relationship, even if you have been together for such long time. Sure it will hurt, he's your first boyfriend after all. But please, do both of you a favor and break up. He will be free to try to get his dream girl (or to stay in his fantasy dreaming about her), and you will be able to find a man who will reciprocate your feelings and will love you for you (without comparing to others).\nYou're 25, you're so young! And there are many other men who dream about having awesome girl like you. You deserve to be truly loved, to be someone's first choice. Wish you luck \ud83c\udf40",

He doesn't feel that way because you're not good enough. You've been good enough to have a relationship with this far, but he hasn't been good enough to be authentic or true to himself or anyone else. When people lie to themselves and you, they will become critical and find your flaws to avoid themselves and dealing with their own issues. This is all on him. \nDon't take this personally or to heart because none of it is your inadequacy. It is an incredibly cruel thing to fake a love and life with someone, with no intention of doing the right thing by them. \nIf I were you. I would pack my stuff (or his), break up, and then go completely no contact. The no contact will hurt like hell initially, but it's far less painful than death by a thousand cuts and wasting more time. \nThe best revenge, in my opinion, is to cut them off and pretend to act like they never existed. While you heal yourself and surround yourself with supportive people. \nIf he has so little regard for you as a person, prolonging this will only cause you more pain and give him more opportunity to damage you. \nTalk to a therapist because you will begin to go through the stages of grief. You'll need help to repair your self-esteem.\nLike others have said, you can't do anything to make him love or respect you, and it would be controlling to try. You can only lead by example and show him how much you love and respect yourself. The more you try to make him respect or love you, the less he will. The more he will justify to himself why you're not worthy in the first place. This is probably why he is still infatuated with this other woman.",

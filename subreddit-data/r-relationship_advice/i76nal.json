Since my last post I spoke to my grandparents and told them everything. I asked if I could stay with them if I wanted to and they agreed. I then spoke to my dad again and tried to tell him how I felt and what I had heard. I didn't want to film or record because I knew that he would be mad at that and wouldn't listen. He didn't believe me again and thought that I was jealous of having to share him with someone else. I got upset and told him that I was leaving so he could live happily ever after without the burden of having me around. He looked shocked but didn't say anything. \n\nI had already packed my bags and had brought some things to my grandparents house already. My dad didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. My grandfather picked me up and I've been there since. I haven't gone home and I haven't heard from my dad. My grandparents told me that they would handle my dad and that I shouldn't have to be the one doing it. \n\nI'm upset that my dad hasn't called or texted me once to see if I'm ok. At the same time I'm feeling so much better being with my grandparents. My grandmother is probably the sweetest person ever and my grandfather is a little rough around the edges but he's really a softie.",

Maybe some day your dad will realize what he's done, but always remember that allowing him back in to your life should be your choice and done on your terms.",

People think you hold a grudge and are unable to let go, but it\u2019s actually quite the opposite. Some people actively tear you down whenever they have the chance and it\u2019s best to not let them back in - unless you, _and only you_, decide that letting them back in is the right choice. It\u2019s letting go of that person in it\u2019s entirety and it\u2019s no longer letting them hold you back. The situation and their behaviour will always be imprinted in your mind but you don\u2019t think about it until something triggers the thoughts back in. The biggest mistake that people make in scenarios like this, is that people think there\u2019s only the option of choosing between forgiving and forgetting or holding a grudge, while in reality you can choose to move on too.",

Others live off the illusion that by forgiving and forgetting, you\u2019ll be more at peace. I won\u2019t.  The erring party will be for sure. That narrative serves only those who hurt you. Instead, build your capacity to move past beyond it by accepting what happened.",

So many people lose their loved ones and don\u2019t emotionally destroy the loved ones they have left. Sure the grief might have caused him to start acting like this, but it was his choice to let her go. It was his choice to side with his new fuck buddy.

Their Dad married his secretary and she hated his kids, so guess who's side their father choose? It fucked them all up, his daughter especially all had major issues with men because of it. I'm sorry to say their mother was the type of woman you don't know...she dated men and took them in her house and they made it miserable for all her children. Both parents really sucked for a long while. their mother eventually realized what she was doing, but to this day, their Dad is still out there oblivious. It's absolutely heartbreaking because even 50 years later, his children still want their father, and he continuously lets them down. :(\n\nSome men just aren't father material. Those men are the ones unwilling to put others first, just like OP's father.\n\nOP's Dad is a damned fool. His wife weeps looking down at this mess, what he's done to their only child is not only absolutely unacceptable, but makes clear how little he loved his wife. If he did love her and did miss her, he would have taken care of the only thing left on their earth that was her flesh and blood, but nope. He instead wanted to make his dick happy. \n\nOP is going to be fine - she is a smart girl in a heart breaking position, but she's got a good head on her shoulders. Some girls never realize what she has. Some still blame themselves. OP has her grandparents, and they should like they can protect her long enough for her to grow into the strong adult her mother wants her to be instead of the sad, isolated one her father seemed to try and make her.\n\nI hope he realizes how stupid he is, and I hope it eats him up inside. What a stupid, fool of a man he is.",

It's not over when they're 18...kids need their parents always. It's a thing my mom has never and will never realize. I gave up hope a long time ago that she would ever be a mom but it sucks that I pretty much don't have a mom or a dad. My dad left when I was a kid and he does try to see us but he's pretty toxic himself and lives far away. It's just sad to say but you dont grow up to be logical and smart with your life with zero guidance.",

I\u2019m sorry this is happening but it could be a total blessing in disguise for you.  If you\u2019re struggling with how to cope with this change, might ask to see a therapist and even spend time talking it out more with your grandparents.  Healthier to learn and practice good coping skills now than 20+ years down the road.\n\nI LOVED spending time with my grandparents and got to often while growing up. Use this opportunity to get to know them better.  Ask them to share old stories from their lives growing up, etc.  If they have hobbies you might be interested in learning later in life, ask to learn now.  For example, I\u2019m 41 and kicking myself now for not learning how to crochet from my grandma and how to make potato salad exactly how she did, it was the best!  Sounds like you\u2019re lucky to have them, as they are you.  \ud83d\udc95",

I still consider this one of my biggest mistakes. The apology was just to get me home because they were embarrassed when people(neighbours etc) asked where I was. They didn't want to fix their behaviour, but they wanted to put on a good outward appearance.\n\nWhen I went back, all the old behaviours were back within days, just more covert. Every petty, shitty thing they could imagine, they did. It fucked me up in so many ways. Nobody should live on edge, waiting for the next retaliation. \n\nOP\nPLEASE stick with your grandparents and finish school. I let guilt and a desire to have a healthy family dynamic keep me in a situation with people who had already shown me that they didn't have any love or respect for me.\n\nAlso, be careful with your credit score /taxes. If your grandparents are taking care of you, they get the right to claim you as a dependent. If things escalate, look into filing for emancipation. It will effect your claim to child support payments, but depending on your state, it can give you a better standing legally. You can still live with your grandparents and if they contribute over 50% of your living expenses (housing costs are included) then you are still a dependent.\n\nBest of luck",

After I cut off my parents I did a sort of credit lock where if anything happened like the above then I would be alerted. \nDefinitely let your grandparents fight for their right to claim you.

About 8 years later they broke up and he lost everything. He had to move back into my grandparents house, was put on child support for the 2 kids he had with her, and had to start all over again. \n\nWhen all this went down he tried fixing our relationship. Everything was going smooth until I found out about 2 weeks after that he already had another girlfriend with a kid of her own. Whatever, I let it go because I ended up meeting her and she was super sweet. Fast forward to about 3 years later and he\u2019s on his 3rd girlfriend, of which I knew about at least. He cheated on all of the girlfriends I knew about, including my mom. So I came to the conclusion that he was just a cheater and couldn\u2019t stand being alone &amp; I was glad that my mom left him when she did.\n\nSo this is where I had the last straw. He once again picked his girlfriend and her kids over me. I was over it. I was old enough to make my own decisions and decided to tell him how I felt. Words were exchanged and I pretty much told him I wanted nothing to do with him or his girlfriends. \n\nFast forward to now, it\u2019s been about 4 years since i\u2019ve spoken to him and I can say I don\u2019t miss him or anything. Here and there I think about how his side of the family and my 2 brothers are doing. Even then I don\u2019t have much of connection with that side and it sucks because it\u2019s not even their fault but they\u2019re paying the price for someone else\u2019s decisions. I know I can reach out but I know they\u2019re not fond of me saying that he\u2019s not my dad &amp; I consider my moms husband my dad. \n\nI have the best relationship with my mom and stepdad and I can\u2019t thank them more for always being there for me. Growing up I put them through hell and back and they never gave up on me. They always tried to open my eyes to the kind of \u201cdad\u201d he was. I hope that whatever women he chooses to stick with can fill in his only daughters spot and realizes that he fucked up.\n\nSorry I went on a little rant, but like I said I 1000% agree with you. OP\u2019s dad isn\u2019t getting out of this without consequences. If OP tries to fix things with her father, I hope that he opens his eyes and doesn\u2019t make the same mistake twice. \n\nIf this is grief, OP is the closest thing to his wife and he should hold on tight to his daughter and show her what a father should be.",

I would like to just put a gentle note here that there is a chance your father might not reach out to you. He might not want to mend things. He might never want to resolve things between you two. If he does, fantastic, but remain neutral on this matter. 5 years is not a long time to truly deal with the loss of a spouse. His world turned upsidedown. It could be that he can't see himself ever having a family after such a loss, you know? You could also remind him of his loss, so he may be more eager to 'get rid of reminders' just like he did with all those photos. \n\nNot everyone copes in a healthy way, and not everyone wants to 'go back to how things were'. \n\nMy father went and had a family with another woman. They don't always want to fix broken relationships. \n\nYou have some incredible advice here. Focus on you. Get your documents. Your grandparents sound like just beautiful souls and I am so glad you had the option to go stay with them. As long as that girlfriend is in the picture, I wouldn't risk going back to that house. Not yet. You might not get a chance to safely leave again if things go badly a second time. This time you caught them by surprise and had the upper hand. Continue to keep that high ground, OP. Rely on your grandparents to do the communicating for now. \n\nYou are a very mature, bright person. I was so proud of you when you were trying to put your dad's happiness before your own feelings. That speaks volumes to your character. You did nothing wrong in all of this. Remember that. This is an issue with your father and his own issues. It's not something you should burden yourself to carry.\n\nFocus on you. Focus on getting yourself on your own feet. Tread carefully, slowly and take everything they tell you with a grain of salt for now. Actions speak more than words. Trust your gut!",

It took me developing cancer for that to happen and even then I was extremely leery. He wanted me to apologize to the stepmom \"to save his marriage.\" I did for him although I had no idea what I was apologizing for. My whole childhood I was emotionally, mentally, and at times physically abused. \n\nTry to stay positive. This lady would have tried to ruin your life. I'm glad you have your grandparents.

If you legally establish guardianship w grandparents the court will create a child custody order/\u201cparenting\u201d plan - it\u2019s standard when custody orders w child support are formed that parents have language that states HOW college is paid for and WHO pays it. In divorces the more financially wealthy parent usually has to pay a greater percentage of college for their kid(s) AND, it\u2019s standard for the order to stipulate that parental child support and payment for college MUST continue until 22 (which is usually near when kids graduate college). It can also stipulate that he must legally carry you on his insurance policy until 26 years of age (the cut off here in the US to be on your parents insurance). \n\nSo I would have your grandparents look into filing a petition at family court to get this all squared away.\n\nThis way, you don\u2019t even have to talk to your dad if you don\u2019t want to. AND he will not be able to weasel out of the obligation of paying for his child. And he will try, believe me. Girlfriend will NOT want any of his money going towards the daughter she despises. So this will protect you and your ability to go to college should you choose that path!\n\nEdited to add: I\u2019m also pretty sure once guardianship is established your grandparents can carry you on their insurance but double check on that!",

Pity your father that he's so weak and stupid. \n\nGood luck!",

When my parents divorced, I was already grown and moved out but my sister was 13. She took it really hard and my dad made no effort to see her. 13 years later, they have a distant relationship. It's sad to see but men like our dads made their choices and will one day face them. Sending you lots of hugs.",

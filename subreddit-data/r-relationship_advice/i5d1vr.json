    "postText": "Me (17m) and my girlfriend (also 17) have been going out 8 and a bit months. We didn't have sex together straight away and first did it only a few weeks ago. I was a virgin before that so I'm not experienced at all and so far I've not been able to make her cum.\n\nBefore dating me, my gf was dating my brother. It was awkward at first but we're all okay now. Anyway so last night I tried my best to make her cum but in the end she told me to \"just stop\" so I did. Then she said \"your brother turned me on so much more than you do\". I was so shocked by her saying that I didn't know what to say back. She got dressed and left the house and we haven't spoken yet.\n\nI just feel so confused about how I feel. I know I'm not as attractive as my brother but I didn't think she would say that. Am I just being a baby and getting upset over nothing? I understand she's probably fed up and she might have just said it in the moment.",

The anonymity of Reddit made me feel way more comfortable asking questions that I would never vocalize to anybody I knew in real life. \n\nLooking back, 99% of the advice was absolute shit that boiled down to \u201cjust be yourself\u201d and \u201cact confident\u201d and the interactions with other users over IRC and teamspeak are where I really developed a basic set of social skills. I couldn\u2019t imagine asking for advice on the internet about interpersonal relationships now, but kids need an opportunity to establish a baseline and forums are a great asset in that regard. \n\nTotally agree with cutting OP a little slack, even if the setup for this entire situation is fucking bonkers to begin with.",

Those who do not love and/or care about you will leave you in the dark so they can blame you later on.\n\nIf they terminate your chance to improve then it is apparent that they are acting in THEIR interests and not yours.\n\nAlso, like mom said, no one starts off as a sex god. It takes time to learn what you like, let alone what your partner likes. When you find a partner that has the capacity to be emotionally and physically intimate with you then you should discuss their sexual needs and wants as well as your own.\n\nAs for your girlfriend, you should really consider breaking things off with her. I won't claim what her motives are but her behavior is indicative of someone who is using you, not loving you.\n\nI hope this helps and that you come to a much better situation than what you started with!",

I was a virgin with my gf and I was getting more and more anxious about how I would perform and how bad it'll be for her and then I just decided to leap an tell her about my anxiety and we talked about what she likes, that to her it didn't matter if i came in 10secs or 10mins (though I am thankful it wasn't the former) and when we were having sex she would give communication when needed, people might think it sucks to be given direction and seem like yiu have no idea what your doing but our first time was one where we both came, had a very pleasurable experience and now I know how and where to touch her i don't need that direction. \n\nLearn your partners body, learn what they like and then once armed with the knowledge the gates are open to you.",

You\u2019re wasting your time on someone that isn\u2019t emotionally mature. If she said that, she\u2019s too dense to understand how it would make you feel, especially because he\u2019s your brother. You deserve better. \n\nTo be honest, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your relationship went downhill if you happened to stay with her within the next 6 months. It may feel hard to break up with her if she\u2019s been your first serious relationship, but what helped me get through my first breakup was reminding myself that being alone is better than feeling weighed down emotionally. And that he wasn\u2019t the only person in the world and I could find someone that cared about me the way I care about others.\n\nEither way, good luck and I wish you the best!",

Dude deserves so much better. \n\nOP, none of this is about your sex performance.  You are just trying with the wrong woman.  Move on and find someone who treats you well and appreciates you for who you are.  \n\nAlso, sex tips for newbies:\n\nDon't skip the foreplay \nMany women can not achieve orgasm without extra stimulation (usually light rubbing of the clitoral area) \nDon't be afraid to ask what works for them... every body is different\nPorn sex is not the goal.  Slow works great, pounding away all the time isn't as enjoyable for women as porn makes it appear to be\nThat said, when you're young everyone is still trying to figure out what works for them.  There is no shame on not starting off as a master. It takes patience and practice. \n\nBest of luck",

If she wasn't enjoying herself what she should have done is  say 'That's not working for me, I'll give you direction to make both of us enjoy this more.' Communication is key to making sure both of you enjoy each other.\n\nInstead she snapped at you. But from how you've written this it sounds like she wasn't into it and had something going on in her head. She seemed to be frustrated and took it out on you. This still isn't ok and could have been handled better.",

I mean at this point the best thing would be for you to end it with her and cut contact (and if your brother finds out about this if he is a decent person he will do the same).  For her to even let those words come out of her mouth, well it says a lot about the type of person she is.  Now show her what type of person you are, which is hopefully a man with self respect that won't tolerate being treated like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the future don't date people who have dated family or REALLY close friends.  It's probably going to cause more drama than anything else and it's just not worth it.",

Age does play a part, but your character lacking like that is also a good indication of who you are. Hopefully she apologizes, but that won\u2019t take away any of the insecurities OP has now gained from this experience. What a fuckin douche she is.",

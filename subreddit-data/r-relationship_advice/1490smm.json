    "postText": "i (20f) dated a guy (22m) and we broke up 2 years ago. we broke up because he said he never had feelings for me or loved me. this happened after a year long relationship of him claiming he loved me, all that stuff. he began dating his ex a few weeks after he broke up with me. this really destroyed me. i tried going no contact but always caved and texted him every few months. but about 6 months ago i had him block me on everything. still, i couldn\u2019t get over him. honestly i just wanted justice for the way he treated me, however messed up that sounds. not a day has gone by where i haven\u2019t thought about him and how much i wish he loved me back. anyway, he unblocked me and texted me earlier this week saying he wants to be friends again. i said yes because i love him still. maybe he will change his mind and love me. i do want to be his friend but i caught myself multiple times lurking his social media and making myself upset over what i find. he said he got diagnosed with a mental illness that would explain why he was so cold and blunt to me. it gave me perspective and now i\u2019m starting to forgive him which is making me a million more steps away from getting over him. how can i continue being his friend without hurting myslef even more? i want to be his friend. i don\u2019t think i\u2019ve felt more connected to anyone ever more than i feel for him. i want to stay his friend but i don\u2019t know how without making myself go crazy",

            "comment": "As long as someone has still romantic feelings and the other doesn't, it is almost impossible to stay friends: There is a disbalance that is unhealthy especially for you as the loving one. I'f I'd be you I would try to let the ex go and explore what other nice people there are in Life. Once both moved on, friendship is maybe possible again... but is it \"neccessary\" then?\n\nFor Perspective: I was around your age, a little older, when I did not listen to the advice I just gave you: I was broken up with after 4 years of LDR but did not \"let go\" of the girl: We stayed in touch sporadicly and always after some years we reconnected somehow when both were single, but didn't make it work for real (distance was always a thing). I uncontiously sabotaged several promising relationships with great women in between always keeping her as an Option: Overall It took me 10 years to get over her, and now with 35 I regret not having let her go earlier. Don't get me wrong I am still happy with my life, and did many great things in this time, but I also missed out on living a healthy relationship. Nowadays I can say that I am friends with her, and she still probably knows me best, but romantic feelings are gone finally",

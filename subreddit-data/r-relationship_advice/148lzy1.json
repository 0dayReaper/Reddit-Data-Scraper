    "postText": "I stopped talking to my family 3 years ago in an attempt to take back control of my life. Growing up was very interesting. I come from a very wealthy family, but my dad was such a pain in the ass and up until I was 23, I felt like was drowning because of his controlling behavior. So I cut him off and I haven't said a single word to him for 3 years. \n\nMy girlfriend and I have been together for 6 years. I got laid off and even though I found a new job, i the pay sucks. Pay is not good and I've been trying to find something that would use my degree this time around. We were willing to relocate and I got a job interview in Philly. Very good job, but I didn't think I was going to get the job due to lack of experience, but I did! I was going to tell my girlfriend this later on in the day.\n\nShe's been trying to get me to talk to my dad about a job offer/getting a \"loan\" until I can find another job. I've said no countless of times. She also wanted me gain access of my trust fund, but I do not want to. In order to do that, I have to speak to my dad, which I do not want to do. She doesn't get why I cannot. I'm telling you, once you go to my dad for something, he will make you feel like the smallest person in his life and it was the worst feeling.\n\nTurns out my girlfriend went to him. I saw a missed call from my dad and a text message when I woke up. Message read \"So I have to hear from your girlfriend that you're having a child? How nice. My doors still open, but you're the one that closed it\". I asked my girlfriend what was he talking about and she said she briefly spoke to him. She got his number from one of his business cards and updated him on my life. I told her I didn't want to speak to him, what made her think I wanted her to? It was out of line what she did and I let her know that. I told her about the job at that moment and she's been trying to make it up to me ever since.\n\nI'm mad, I really am. I understand the spot I was in, but still. She might not get it, but it didn't give her the right to go behind my back like that. What's the best way to go about this?",

She is pregnant with a child and scared for not just her future, but the future of your kid. She was definitely in the wrong and crossed a line - that absolutely needs to be talked about and resolved. I just want to be a different voice saying she's probably very scared for your unborn child. It's easy to be supportive when it's two adults roughing it and struggling. It's much harder when a newborn factors into that. I believe she just wants a secure future for her kid, and that's the primary motivation behind this.\n\nOnce your job is secure and she feels like the future you two are building is a safe enough one for your kid, I believe she will calm down.",

She\u2019s got an ENTIRELY different collection of concerns right now than me, you, and the OP.\n\nAnd one of them clearly goes over the top, even breaking boundaries and disrespecting OP's. Guy must have been trough hell and back, to prefer being \"poor\" and having cut contact with his family. I wonder about those who say that its his \"pride\" know a damn about whats like to live with and abusive father like that; I know first hand about it and believe me, id rather see the world burn before I get back to that. And she blatantly skipped over that for HER concerns.\n\nHell no. She messed up REAL hard. Being pregnant is not a white card to behaving like an asshole. I for sure wont want to have a baby with a person like that... trust has been broken , and it wont NEVER get fixed 100% after that.\n\nAnd this \"thing\" about her needing a support system... He's working, and providing, even when op lost a work, post does not says that she's having any economic problem. Plus, doesnt she works? Does she not has a family ( albeit not as privileged as op's but anyways )? Is she purely dependant on him or what? We are in 2023, not in the sixteenth century.",

That's your right- you aren't obligated to unpack your baggage in order to have a boundary like that respected- but you might want to think about giving her more information about why you took such a drastic stance and why you would rather struggle for a while than get sucked back into whatever bog of narcissistic bullshit surrounds your father and his money.  If, after you have laid it out,  she still thinks your dignity is less important than the money you walked away from,  well, that's information you should have while you figure out if you're going to continue to be a couple or if you're going to have to figure out how to be co-parents.\n\nI am really sorry you're going through this and I hope that,  however it works out,  you thrive in the next chapter",

He offered her $50k and ongoing support to disappear with our unborn son, behind my back.\n\nOur marriage lasted only seven years, but we have two beautiful kids who come first in my eyes.  I've done some questionable things to make sure they're okay financially, but only once did I go to him to help THEM when I couldn't, shortly after the divorce.\n\nHad a windfall since then, got run over working in oil and gas.  It came with a broken neck and ribcage, I'm lucky to still be here.  Our relationship was still rocky at that point, and he sent me a bill for what it cost to raise me.\n\nI sent him half of that amount, and told him never to talk to me about money again.  Or at all, for that matter.  My sister died a long time ago, his family is fractured and divided by the amount of money in it.\n\nIt sounds like you and your girl have a generally solid relationship.  I wouldn't throw that away on principle, because with family like that it gets easier and easier to cut people out for a lack of trust.  Rich family has a way of infecting their young with that.\n\nI'd struggle with the blow though, for real.  It's a huge blow.  Be careful using the truth in anger though, but you haaaave to tell her how deeply that cut you.  You owe it to yourself, if nothing else.  She might have a hard time understanding, because she wasn't there growing up.  Try not to blame her too harshly for that.\n\nYou have to do what feels right for you though.  Not everyone has a happy story at the end, but you have to feel content with your decisions at the very least.  Angry truth comes with alot more regret than explaining to someone how they hurt you.  It's instinct to feel cornered when you're raised by \"giants\" the way my dad and yours (presumably) seem sometimes.  An impossible standard to measure yourself against.\n\nMy vote, for what it's worth, is make it abundantly clear how much of a deeply rooted tumor he is to you, and that you want no future with him whatsoever.  If she does, then fine.  I told my kids that their grandpa and I don't speak, and I don't want to poison the well be going into my reasons.  They can try, he can try, but I need to be completely separate and I don't want to know.",

One of these rules should be to never contact your father again, period, no matter what. Another rule should be that you both go to couple's counseling, and that your girlfriend goes to individual therapy, so she can learn the importance of boundaries. \n\nIf the answer to ***either*** of the above questions is \"No\", then you need to end the relationship and discuss co-parenting. Speak to a lawyer before you break up with her, to see how custody laws in your jurisdiction works and what your rights are. Being raised by separated parents is always better for a child than being raised by parents who are together but resent each other. \n\n...\n\nAt the end of the day, your girlfriend committed a major betrayal of your trust.

If you'd been just starting out looking for a job, that's one thing, but months of giving it your all and no results would be incredibly stressful for a pregnant woman. My husband was pretty much guaranteed an easy path to a decent paying career after he got out of the military, but I was pregnant at the time, and was incredibly stressed about the job offer falling through, or something going wrong and we don't have insurance when I go into labor, etc. And that was AFTER he got an offer letter and everything was signed, we just had to wait until he was out. I can't imagine the stress of months of this with no end in sight. Idk if I'd do the same thing as her, but that may be because I am personally familiar with the necessity of cutting off toxic family members (for very different reasons than yours, but the idea isn't difficult for me to wrap my head around). I hope you're not jumping to the gold digger conclusion many people on here favor. \n\nWe obviously don't know everything, it sounds like maybe she is showing remorse now that she knows you have a job? Hard to tell from your responses. Either way you have every right to be upset with her about this, but it's important to consider perspective.

For all you know what she did was out of pure unadulterated desperation over the financial situation and the fact that she feels like she's having to support you and the new baby you're going to have by herself. Also whether us men tend to realize it or not women take the majority of the burden for being caregivers for children while still having to work. \n\n- Can you imagine thinking in your brain that not only are you probably going to have to do an unequal share of the child care because that's just the way our society works but now you're going to have to try to do it and support the family financially? Not only financially but at an increased financial cost because of an impending baby. Can you imagine how absolutely desperate and defeated that might make her? What other choices did she have?\n\nShe knew that you had access to a trust fund and that your dad could probably help out financially so she made the best decision she could with the information she had available. What else was she supposed to do see the dire financial straits that you guys were in see herself being pregnant and not worry about it at all?\n\n\nNone of this excuses her going behind your back but I can absolutely understand getting to the point where she felt like that was the only option left.",

If you want to stay with her, it\u2019s definitely worth some continued discussion about how toxic your family is and how important it is to you to keep them completely out of your life. Coming from a different background than you (ie not being raised by emotionally and financially abusive narcissists) I can understand if she doesn\u2019t fully grasp the gravity of your NC decision. I am also NC with my financially abusive and narcissistic wealthy father, but I know people who have a different (feels weird to me) relationship with their families. For some people, family is their base, a lifeline, some kind of unbreakable bond at their very core. For us, we understand that parents are just people, and they can be shitty people that you don\u2019t want/need in your life. \n\nYour girlfriend was probably panicking about bringing your child into a very precarious financial situation, I\u2019m not saying blame it on pregnancy hormones, but people do completely crazy shit when they\u2019re only thinking in their child\u2019s best interest. I can imagine she probably thought \u201chey, we really need some fucking money to tie us over for a while and be prepared when the baby arrives if he\u2019s unable to find a better paying job. Whatever he went through with his parents, familial love *must* be deeper than that, and he *must* be able to overcome it in the best interest of our baby.\u201d She was probably preparing for the worst case scenario financially, so she disrespected your boundaries for what she thought would be for the ultimate good of your family. \n\nI\u2019m not telling you what to do. If you want to try to work through this, she sounds remorseful. You might be able to get back to a place of mutual trust and respect with some deep conversations.

And if pregnancy hormones are spinning her out on top of everything else, yeah, doing something a bit stupid is kinda understandable.",

            "comment": "\"I ain't saying she a gold digger...\"\n\nBut in all honesty as some others have mentioned pregnancy hormones can be somewhat of an excuse. However, how she went BEHIND your back speaks volumes on her character and the lengths she will/can go. As the future mother of your child, I would be especially vigilant from now on.\n\nAt best this was truly a one off desperate play from a young pregnant lady. At worst you might be dealing with a narcissist that will not only hurt and break your trust further while traumatizing your child in the hellish process. In that case, you have some serious self-reflection to do. Which I would recommend anyways as abusive households have a strong tendency to continue the pattern of abuse (even after you cut ties) as deep psychological scars cause the victims to fall in the hands of new abusers. As a survivor of narccistic abusive household myself, and your description of your abusive father sounds far too similar... Much love to you OP and I'm glad you are in a better place now.\n\nA very useful resource for comprehending and processing your trauma is Patrick Teahan LICSW on Youtube. I think you'll find some of his videos especially on narcissism and childhood trauma all too painfully relatable just like me and other folks fortunate enough to come across his channel.",

You need to hear where she is coming from and then let her know where you're coming from. \n\nA lot of people are jumping to conclusions because your dad has a lot of money. As you said, you have been together for 6 years, and this is the first time she has done this. If she just wanted the money, she would have been updating him daily for the last 3 years you went NC.\n\nYour girlfriend is PREGNANT and you had lost your job. First of all, as a pregnant woman, her emotions are all over the place. She might not even be really thinking straight. Pregnancy brain is a thing, and as a new soon-to-be mom, she's probably concerned as hell about providing for this child. Especially if you guys are dependent on your income to be financially stable. \n\nShe had no right to go behind your back and try to bring your Dad back into your life like that when you obviously cut him off for a reason. That is 100% true. However, just because she went to your dad to ask for help when she thought you needed it doesn't mean she is now basically a gold digger. She is just looking for security. Like you said, she knew your dad could provide you with a job. If she JUST wanted the money, she could have gone literally anywhere else. Yeah, she may have encouraged you to dip into the trust fund, but like I said, it could be just to know that the money is there should you need it. Do you know how TERRIFYING it is to be pregnant with your emotions on a whole other level and not knowing how you are going to provide? The last thing a mother wants is to worry about how or when she's gonna feed their child or if they'll have a place to sleep safely. You might think that's crazy or not that big of a deal, but in a pregnant woman's or a mother's mind, it can be.\n\nYou know your girlfriend better than we do. Is she really the kind to just follow the money trail? Or was she just trying to do what she thought was right to support your baby?\n\nYou both need to communicate and try to get an understanding from eachothers perspectives. Without letting others cloud your judgement. I just wanted to give a different perspective than the ones who are just instantly telling you she is with you for the money. She made a mistake. It was a stupid and very hurtful mistake. One that feels like utter betrayal. But once you become a parent, the world is no longer just about you. That baby is a top priority. Just try to at least understand why she did what she did and if she's even guilty or showing any remorse. \n\nIn the end, whatever happens next is up to you. I just pray you don't let anyone cloud your judgment and don't let anyone make you believe something that isn't true. If you guys break I hope it's because you guys couldn't move past this together and not because you really believe she's a gold digger because of the comments.",

It's such a break of trust in a way that to me would be as bad as infidelity, because it destroys for me completely.  \n\nI hate the excuse( I saw it in the comments) that because their parents aren't bad they have a hard time understanding how bad it is and that she acted in your families best interest: \n\n1. They don't understand how bad it is, is one of the worst excuses I hear for things like this. Just because you haven't gone through it doesn't mean you can't understand or be empathetic to something.  I am not gay, but I am understanding and empathic towards the problems and trauma a lot unfortunately go through and I wouldn't minimize that. I am not a women either, but I can also be understanding of the challenges they go through. You don't need have gone through things to have basic empathy towards people nor to not act like you know better than them about their own trauma.\n2.  She did it because she thought it was best for you and your family. No she did it because she thought she knew better than you, she invalidated your trauma, your choice, she couldn't give less of a fuck about your agency. She did what she wanted without a care for you, or because she thought knew better and that says a lot about what she thinks about you.\n\nIf you didn't have a child on the way I would say walkway without even thinking about it. Now I want to make one thing clear don't let her or anyone in the comments or your life try to guilt you to stay for the kid. It's better to coparent for the child than be in a shite relationship.\n\nIf you're having servere doubt the child is the only reason I'd maybe give it a shout, but she would have to work very hard to earn back the trust and if she even does something remotely close it's done.  Another thing would be any marriage talk or big commitments would be postponed by a decade or something around that timeframe, her reaction to this would also tell you a lot imo.\n\nHeck I might even think it's smart to get a DNA test, she is untrustworthy and has proven to be able to do things behind your back and being able to hide it well. She is not exactly the person you thought she was, you thought she was your rock and safe place, but she clearly wasn't",

Communicate thoroughly and explain you don't want his assistance and it will not be acceptable if it happens again unless it's like a medical life or death emergency. You still have the option of not following up. I'll bet reddit will stomp her to death over this and scream dump her. You have a baby coming. Work through this but keep your eyes open that this level of intrusion won't become a pattern. Good luck on your job.",

That option is completely off the table. \n\nAnd if she breaches your trust again in what you can only term as no faith in your abilities to keep your little family going then there will be no family and only co-parents.",

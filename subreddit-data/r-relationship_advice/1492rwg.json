    "postText": "Hi everyone!\nMy boyfriend (26M) and I (26F) have had a week of fights and drama and I think I am at my last straw. We've been dating for 3-4 months and it's a LDR. He came to visit me for 10 days a few weeks ago and we had the best time ever. I really like him for many things and he's genuinely a really great man who I imagine spending the rest of my life with.\nThe first fight that happened was because I texted him while I was going home from hanging out with my friends and my phone turned off, and he got super upset that I took an hour to turn it on and reassure him that I am home. (The way home was 30-40 mins) \nHe said I had no respect and regards for our relationship and that if I truly loved him my first priority when I got home was to turn my phone on asap and text him. We had a long fight about it, especially since I was also a bit tipsy and he doesn't like that I drink occasionally. While we were fighting I told him that this is who I am and he can leave if he wants. That upset him further and so we had a new fight about me not being as committed to this relationship. I talked to him about it and we had a civil one on one call just to fix things. \nThings got better but then the next day we were talking about something random and it kind of hit a soft spot that I have. I told him I used to have no self worth and in my early twenties (21,22) I would send nudes to strangers on the internet. That upset him very much and I calmly told him that I understand if this is a deal breaker for him and I would see why he would leave me. He then also got upset that it's so easy for me to dispose of this relationship when in reality it's not. I just don't want to force someone to be with me if that's a big sacrifice he needs to make. We talked about it again and he decided he has enough but I told him that we both love each other and we just need to make it through the honeymoon phase, so he agreed and we stayed together. \nYesterday, I texted him the sweetest good morning text and he was very dry in general about his response and I asked him if he was okay, he said he's still upset and pissed off about what happened, so that kind of just put my mood down. I was already having my own problems and bad day and it was a blow, so I became as dry while texting as well. It wasn't until I finished work at night that we called and he started telling me why I was rude and dry texting him, and why I was forcing myself to talk to him and all that. I then exploded and told him he's not the center of my universe and that I had this and that in my life. He went very quiet and asked why haven't I shared that with him, and I basically told him that it's more of a family thing than a me thing. We made up after that and we had a good call. \nI went home and he wanted to sext and all. I was very into it and enjoying myself when I suddenly just fell asleep. It was the rudest thing ever, i know, but it wasn't on purpose. \nI woke up apologizing and saying I didn't mean it. So now I woke up to him being pissed off and saying he won't ask me for it again and that I was selfish and I made him feel silly and bad. I tried to reassure him that it's just me being exhausted and that I really really want him and I can change his mind. He told me to close the topic as it's getting more annoying by the second. \n\nSo AITA in any part of the above? I know I fucked up, but I always try to apologize and move on but it's easier. I am not a demanding or picky partner, but Idk.",

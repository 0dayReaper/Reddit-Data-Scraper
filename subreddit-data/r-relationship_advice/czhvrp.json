    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI need some serious advice as i'm pretty much being cornered by basically everyone and i really don't know what else to do as my mental state is declining and i'm left wondering if it's really all my fault?\n\nA little background: \n\nMe and my ex-fianc\u00e9e had been together for almost 6 years and engaged for 4 out of those 6 years. I was introduced to her by a close friend at a party and we just clicked. She was attractive, had a great personality and had similar hobbies as me which made it perfect.\n\nBack in April of this year i started noticing little changes in her, she started wearing more revealing clothes to work, started putting more make-up and etc. Tbh i had no problem with any of that stuff as it's her body, she can wear whatever and put how ever much make-up she wanted to but what made things worse for me was when she started coming home late from work or how instead of spending the weekend off with me (we both had weekends off from work) she instead was always going out. I once had asked her why she never invited me to come out with her to which she replied that it's only girls night out and that her other friends would not be happy if i tagged along as they were not bringing their own bf with them.\n\nIt all came crashing down when me and her had a huge fight in June because she decided that instead of going out on a date with me she told me how she already had made plans with her friends and that it was rude of her to cancel. That was it for me, i fucking blew up at her and we had huge fight which resulted in her packing her bags and leaving. I didn't hear from her for almost a week, none of her friends knew where she was and heck none of her folks even knew what was going on until she finally contacted me and wanted to talk.\n\nImagine my surprise when she confessed to me that there was another guy involved and how all this time she was hanging out with him when all this time she was lying to me about hanging with her friends. I fucking blew up, i wanted nothing to do with her and was going to break up with her until she got on her knees and begged me to give her a second chance which my dumbass self did but only after she revealed everything to me and she did. It made me fucking sick to my stomach but in the end i forgave her and told her to delete all contact with the other guy and that i expect her to have no contact with him going forward which she promised and things kinda went back to before.\n\nHeck, we were even spending more time together but that feeling, that trust wasn't there anymore.\n\nEverything was kinda OK until 2 weeks ago a friend of mine who was visiting another city which was 3 hours from where i lived sent me a picture with the message \"Sorry bro\" that broke my already broken heart into a billion of little pieces. The picture was of my ex-fianc\u00e9e at a mall 3 hours away from where we lived holding hands with some stranger who i didn't know. I fucking broke down, i was heartbroken. She was a bitch, a piece of shit especially since i thought she was at work while in reality she was 3 hours away holding hands with her lover.\n\nWhen i got home from work i waited for her and right away confronted her which she denied and called me a psycho for not believing her and that i was a piece of shit for not trusting her until i showed her the picture that my friend sent me. Her face told me everything and when the waterworks started i knew that i had made a huge mistake in taking her back so i ended it.\n\nShe cried and fucking begged me to think it over and not to throw away everythink that we have together which made me fucking angry and i'm not going to lie but i fucking slapped her. I was not proud, i'm still not but she saying shit like not to throw away everthing when it was her who threwaway everything pissed me off.\n\nI told her to pack her shit and leave, called her parents and mine and told them everything, her parents came to help her and i told them to basically fuck off after they told me to think it over and to make the right decision before actually ending it. She begged me not to end things but i did, had to for my own piece of mind.\n\nI did not hear from her or her parents until 3 days ago when my parents called me to let know that ex-fianc\u00e9e had comitted suicide. Her parents found her hanging and she had left a letter apologising to everyone including my parents and me and how she is sorry from the bottom of her heart for what she did to me and that how she can't live without me and because of that she ended it.\n\nI am at a fucking lose, ex-fianc\u00e9e friends and family are blaming me and my own mother told me that it was my fault, she told me that i should have forgiven her since i'm clearly worth comitting suicide over. \n\nI am fucking disgusted, i have currently taken some time off from work and have not a single clue what to do.",

            "comment": "You took her back. You forgave her. She lied again and turned it on you holding past transgressions over her. If it weren't for that picture she would have kept lying. She was actively trying to manipulate you into thinking you were wrong and she was the victim.\n\nI think she realized she lost you for good and it drove her to do what she did. Her parents are grief stricken. They want to blame anyone for this. In the end their daughter had mental health issues. Your mother... Being a mother... Feels their pain and also for some reason I don't understand wants to blame someone. \n\nI'm sorry for your loss. Ex or not this woman meant something to you. Talk to the friend who gave you the heads up. Seems like he was the only one who really wanted what is best for you. If need be seek therapy just to sort through everything. This is hugely traumatic for you. You even feel remorse for slapping her in a moment of complete betrayal. You have no reason to own her suicide. You owned up to emotions overtaking you and hitting her. You have nothing else to own up to.\n\nI wish you the absolute best in this difficult time.\n\nEdit: Thank you kind folks for the awards. Thank you also for the kind messages as well. \n\nOp clearly you not only have your friend but from the looks of the comments the support of many redditors. Im glad my words were of some help.",

I also wanted to say, that you were very generous in forgiving her the first time and she should've realised then, that what she did was wrong and that you are a great person for forgiving her. Don't blame yourself and don't let the people who do get to you. \nI'm also gonna join the club of people you can hit up, if you feel down and need somebody to talk to :).

I felt a lot of guilt for a long time (especially after another friend blamed me) and I sought help. It took me a long time to realize that it was never my - or her family's or anyone else around her - fault. I highly recommend (like everyone else) that you talk to someone.

But please, please take everything you read on reddit as though we are all 14-year-olds who are good at creative writing. We are not experts, and you are dealing with some complicated stuff. \n\nI have experienced some pretty serious loss, although not at the same level as yours, and finding a good therapist was invaluable. Don't just go with anyone - check out reviews, or get a good word-of-mouth recommendation. \n\nIt is not easy to post something like this on Reddit, and I absolutely agree with many of the other posters in that you should not be taking responsibility for her actions. \n\nI recommend reading/listening to Brenee Brown. She has a great Ted talk, and a fantastic book called \"The Power of Vulnerability\". She will help see how far you've come, and give you an excellent study on blame, shame, and healthy vulnerability. \n\nBest of luck, OP.

Shit, the fucking parenting here waving red flags all along but what really irks me is OP's own folks! How in the name of what is pure and holy do you tell your kid it's not only OK to forgive a recurring cheater but blame him for the out come of the cheater's behaviour??? It baffles my mind.\n\nOP feels guilty because he truly loved her but he did nothing wrong. The cheater threw away everything hey both built together. The cheater ended the trust and relationship, not OP. A lot of people have been cheated on through out their lives and tons more don't continue the relationship for obvious reasons. Either they go separate ways or they forgive and the relationship devolves and doesn't survive. No one has the right to tell you what you MUST DO in these cases. It's up to the couple and if at least one of the parties is out, both of them are.\n\nThe cheater has shitty parents and OP too. He should distance himself from toxic people which sadly includes his family. He's been mourning the death of his relationship way before this ordeal, mourning the loss of the woman he fell in love with which never existed and an actual death. He needs professional help, counseling at the very least and take time for himself. No one has given OP the time of day to reflect and calm down which is so very sad.\n\nIt's awful when you don't have a support system. He needs his true friends now more than ever and cut the idiots off, including his family. No one bats an eye for the cheater's friends. They are scummy too if they condone lying to loved ones.",

A lot of shit has gone down and people are looking to anything and anyone to take out their emotions on. \n\nI assure you if you go you will become part of the problem. The centre of attention will shift from her and remembering her life to you and how they believe you were a part of the problem no matter how out of your hands this whole situation was. \n\nI am sadly talking from experience. Had a good friend break up with her boyfriend of a few years. They had moved in together. He started being extremely controlling and aggressive, never hit out on her luckily. We all advised her to break it off now before things got any worse or deeper. \n\nA week after he was found hanging in their house. \n\nTurns out he was on anti depressants. No one knew not even the family. \n\nThey **all** blamed her. She went to funeral and she was in pieces she blamed herself for everything and when she arrived she was treated like shit. \n\nDon\u2019t go. Move on. This is not your fault. This was her mental state that none of her direct family dealt with or saw coming and now need someone to become the answer to all the problems they did not see.",

They should do an autopsy of her body and see if she was on drugs. It\u2019s not your fault.\n\nEdit: For people saying \u201coh don\u2019t judge the family\u201d. Read what OP said. The family begged him to stay with their daughter when they knew she was hoeing around with Tom, Bill, and Bobs. They probably knew for years that she was cheating on him! They saw he\u2019s a good bf and wanted their daughter to settle down with a \u201cgood\u201d man. Basically they wanted someone to take care of their daughter, and someone who wouldn\u2019t beat her ass for cheating. That just speaks shitty parenting itself. Regardless suicide is a personal choice people make. Unless she was being bullied and harassed by the OP...it sounds like she choose to end herself because she couldn\u2019t handle the reality of being broken up for cheating and whatever bad stuff she was doing. They should see if she had mental health problems, was raped, or on drugs. If she wasn\u2019t on neither, then she was just a cheater and a bad girlfriend. I\u2019ve been cheated on before and it\u2019s a shitty feeling! This man went through four years of hell and was getting ready to marry her! It is not his fault. In this case, OP should not be blamed for her death.",

This isn't even subtle about how fake it is, it's literally the perfect \"women are irrational cheating bitches and I just don't get how everyone is so unfair to me\" incel Reddit story.\n\nAnd, cheated on or not, the guy doesn't seem particularly broken up or conflicted by the fact that someone he was with for six years *fucking killed themselves*. Like, *if* this story were true I could get feeling still feeling angry or hurt, that's one thing, but there's literally not one moment where he goes \"so this woman that I loved for over 20% of my life so far fucking hung herself a few days ago and I'm actually pretty messed up over it despite any mixed feelings about our relationship\". Nope, it's all about how much of a cheating bitch she was and how angry he is that everyone blames him for it. I've got an ex from literally *years* ago who I still hugely resent for the shitty way she treated me, and I *still* know I'd be a fucking mess if I ever found out she'd killed herself. Even if this guy was still pissed about the alleged cheating, the fact that he doesn't spare even a single thought for the fact that a woman he supposedly loved *literally just committed suicide* is telling as all hell.\n\nEither this guy is a sociopath, or this is 100% completely made up. And if I were a betting man, my money would be on \"both\".",

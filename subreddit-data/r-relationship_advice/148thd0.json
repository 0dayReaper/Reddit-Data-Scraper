    "postText": "My boyfriend broke up with me because I stress him out. We used to live together but the thing is, we could not do the NO CONTACT rule because we own businesses together and we rely with one another when it comes to business decisions.\n\nThere were a lot of factors according to him: \n- He said i'm an alpha and he's an alpha -He's OC and i'm quite messy\n-He plays videogames and I don't\nIt became a routine that we're always together at work but when we get home, he would take me for granted like we would only have sex like once a month i felt unwanted and that he's tired of me.\nWe built so much together and we have been partners and I want to fight for this relationship, we talk everyday about everything he would pick me up, we still kiss and hug but i feel like he's no longer in love with me but we still do these things together.\n\nMy relationship became a situationship and I want him back.\nhow to have him back without doing the no contact rule because it's not applicable to us?",

You need to have a conversation with him a discuss your feelings and what your intentions are. If he is willing to try then you will need to compromise some things in the relationship (dimming some of your alpha energy as a example) and he will need to compromise as well. Now if he is not interested in rekindling the relationship then it has to be strictly business. Only business conversation, no hanging out, and definitely no friends with benefits.",

    "postText": "We\u2019ve been together for a bit over a year and attend the same college. He\u2019s from another country, so he goes home for 4-6 weeks in the summers and winters. \n\nWhen he\u2019s here, it feels almost as though we are already a married couple, as we unintentionally live together (we were roommates and then started dating) and spend most of our free time together. I would say our relationship is quite healthy and secure when he is here, with lots of communication, connection, love, etc. \n\nWhen he goes home, however, there is a severe lack in communication. I initiate most text conversations and phone calls, yet we still go several days without a single text, and usually about a week between calls. Our entire relationship has mainly been in-person, which is why I think calls between us often feel awkward and forced. Rarely it feels like we can get into our usual conversational groove over the phone, and he doesn\u2019t give the same energy that he gives when we are together. \n\nI\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I would like to talk to him more when he is at home, because otherwise I spend 4-6 weeks feeling like I don\u2019t even have a boyfriend. But he tells me that we can talk all we want to when he gets back and that he just doesn\u2019t like talking over the phone. I also realized is that we will likely not have another break like this for a while, as he invited me to his home for winter and he plans to stay here next summer. \n\nSo I\u2019m conflicted. On one hand, maybe I\u2019m being overbearing and should just let him spend this time with his family without worrying so much about the lack of communication. We will certainly get enough of each other when he gets back, and I can\u2019t deny that our phone and text conversations can feel awkward. On the other hand, I feel extremely disconnected from him every time he goes home, and I\u2019m left to wonder if our relationship would survive long-term long-distance, which is a very real possibility for us after college. It also hurts me that I seem a lot more eager to talk to him than he is to talk to me.\n\nShould I just learn to accept this as part of our relationship? Should I talk to him again about it, and perhaps find more suitable ways for us to communicate during long-distance? Any suggestions or experience with this type of situation are greatly appreciated. \n\n\ntldr: bf barely communicates for weeks whenever he goes home since we\u2019ll see each other soon anyway. leaves me feeling disconnected and anxious about potential long-term long-distance. asking for advice to handle this.",

Texting can be easier with the time difference. Obviously anything could happen and it would be nice if he tried to include you more. I think this is a see how it goes situation for now.",

Doesn\u2019t he want them to meet you?\n\nAlso, I have been on vacations with people who were apart from their partners and being tethered to the phone talking to them and Skyping and keeping in touch really would just kill the vacation for me. I personally prefer to vacation solo, but I\u2019m also single so unless I can find a single person with similar plans then I\u2019m just going to have more fun by myself.  I completely disconnected for 3 weeks last month and it was wonderful. \n\nBut again, if it already feels like y\u2019all are married, you should be joining him on these trips soon!",

If not, then it\u2019s okay to go your separate ways and maybe rekindle later if you stay in touch. \n\nYou\u2019re both very young and if these trips of his are something you simply cannot deal with, then tell him and try to work through it or maybe move on now rather than later if he doesn\u2019t want to at least communicate a few times a week while he is gone \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nI\u2019m good at being single, not great at relationships, but that\u2019s because I care more about my own well being that appeasing my partner. Relationships take selflessness and sacrifice and I\u2019m at a stage where the effort isn\u2019t worth it for me. I just prefer being alone. \n\nI tell you this to not be like me. It\u2019s not for everyone and it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019d like to be alone, so you\u2019ll have to make concessions here and there with relationships.  He also needs to be willing to make compromises like keeping in touch at least a little while he is gone for several weeks. \n\nI think you got this! You both seem like your heads are in the right place, but just got to learn each other a bit better and work out these little kinks. \n\nI will say that it\u2019s a bit of an awkward thing IMO to be preemptively thinking about grad school when that is at least a year or two down the line. Focus on the now and what you can change and control.  \ud83d\udc95",

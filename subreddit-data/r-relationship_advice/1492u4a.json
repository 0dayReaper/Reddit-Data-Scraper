    "postText": "It was the 3rd time I (F29) had met the (M33) in person and was looking for to it, then he just disappeared. \n\nI had met this guy on Facebook on a group we had a common interest in and he added me as a friend. Weeks later I asked him a question and I ended up meeting him the next day. Seemed nice and the conversation got sexual etc. I eventually met him again and for the day and we had fun. The next day he dropped of the face of the earth. \n\nI assumed he had a gf and I saw other reasons to suspect it. He told me his Facebook got hacked and he told me he had a gf but it was actually the hacker saying that, he blocked me on everything, then unblock me to talk to me and I caught him lying about his Facebook. \n\nA week after ghosting he came back and told me his phone had died and he was very sorry. I wanted to confront him about having a gf so we arranged to meet half way and I laid it all out. I said just be honest because I\u2019d like to know. He said no no not at all and said I can understand why you\u2019d think that, but he was single. He was extremely genuine, and we went for a walk, we got close but thankfully nothing more. It seemed to be going well and 2hrs later I went for a wee in a bush and upon my return he has legged it. \n\nI thought he was a joke at first but I found my hoddy, car keys etc on the floor where he had left them. I called him but did not pick up. I\u2019d never been to this woodland before and it was getting dark, so I found my way back to the car, and his was gone. \n\nI\u2019m struggling not to blame myself. Most people I talk to say he 100% had a gf and he did not like being caught out. But then I think maybe he was being genuine and got fed up with me and just ditched me as he didn\u2019t want to chase me anymore. I was very nervous on this walk and I was slowly warming towards kissing him. I\u2019m baffled why anyone would do such a thing. \n\nMy gut is learning towards having a gf, how do I not blame myself, I\u2019m struggling? UK based.",

    "postText": "I never thought this would be something I have to write up, but here we are!\n\nI work in a white collar corporate job and we have interns every summer. I try to be a good mentor and friendly - I remember being that age and at a first job. \n\nThis summer we have an intern that did a small project for me in her first week. She did a good job (to be honest it was intern work and very straight forward, but she did it right). I was my normal/friendly self and told her that and we had maybe a 15 minute chat in my office about what she does at college, how excited she was for things to do over the summer, etc.\n\nThat weekend I got a 2am notification that she\u2019d added me on instagram. I ignored it because whatever she probably was drunk and made a mistake. However this last week she\u2019s come by my office every day and then tried to add me again late night over the weekend. She\u2019s asked multiple times about my dating life, how in the world a guy like me is single, and which apps I\u2019m on/she made a joke that she needs to move up her age range.\n\nI don\u2019t want to damage her career by making a complaint, but what are suggestions on how I can nip this in the bud? Preferably in a way that doesn\u2019t embarrass her as she seems like a nice/good person but is shooting her shot in a situation she shouldn\u2019t be.\n\nThanks!!",

This flips the usual power dynamic and maybe it makes it more plausible that she doesn't get what shes doing but it doesn't matter . Whether you're a 50 year old man attracted to your 25 year old junior or a 20 year old intern attracted to a 30 year old senior colleague its not hard not to repeatedly pursue someone to the point of making them uncomfortable- is it?\n\nAnd if it is, then you need support from HR to understand how not to harass people in future. OPs right to not be harassed trumps her right to her job",

Just simply let her know that she's flattering you, but nothing could ever happen due to the fact that your career would be on the line. It also wouldn't make her look good.\n\nI had a situation like this come up myself when I was 23. I had a major crush on my boss. After he moved to a different office, I came on to him while drunk at his going away party. He moved away from me so fast! I later found out that he was still going to be my boss from the different office. \n\nI appreciated his clearly sent signal that nothing could happen. I never tried anything again, but remained friendly. He's been supportive of my career and me personally ever since. It's never been inappropriate since the moment of his clearly sent shut-down.",

I promise they will give you 10 million methods to dissuade someone with minimal confrontation. \n\nEasiest would be invent an imaginary girlfriend. Maybe put a picture on your desk. One that doesn't look anything like her so she knows she's not your type.\n\nFind someone else to flirt with in front of her, have someone drop by and \"stake her claim\" on you \n\nCompliment or talk about someone you're dating and how amazing they are. (Preferably in front of her not to her, really talk to her as little as possible)\nEmphasize differences from her, intelligence, maturity, anything that shows they're objectively more desirable &amp; successful than her that will make her feel inferior &amp; like she's not good enough for you. (Yes that took a dark turn but it works, e.g. if I brag about someone being tall the short dudes will leave me alone)\n\nOr complain about someone you're dating (emphasize similarities to her/annoying shit she does)\n\nCasually mention how you don't date anyone below x age due to maturity/creepiness\n\nEmphasize how young she is, how you see her as a kid\n\nFigure out what she doesn't like and embody that\n\nAgain just talk to her as little as possible. \nReally dont even make eye contact \n\nAs a last resort, you can grey-rock her. Without being rude, you just keep it ultra professional, calm and emotionless. It will come off cold and pointedly detached. Sometimes you just can't be nice or friendly at all to people who are into you. Can't give em an inch or they'll get their hopes up\n\nBoundaries. Don't respond, leave, or simply say \"ooo yeah I don't think that's workplace appropriate, sorry.\"\n\nMy favorite one rn is \"oh sorry, I'm not allowed to do that!\" For everything. Whose rule is it? The highest authority.\n\nOr ya know... Be direct ?",

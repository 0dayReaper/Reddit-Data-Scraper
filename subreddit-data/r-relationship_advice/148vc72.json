    "postText": "Tl;dr: my mom works from home but asks me to do a lot of her job, like make spreadsheets, send emails., etc. Is that normal to help out a family member like that?\n\nI'm in my mid 20s, female, and I moved back in with my mom after taking time off college after my mental health got really bad and I was hospitalized for depression and started failing my college classes. I made mistakes in college and I know I am clearly behind in life and shouldn't be living with my mom anymore. I work 25-30 hours a week in a factory job and take classes part time, so I'm not doing as much as most people my age and I know I could be doing more.\n\nMy mother hasn't worked in many years and for the past 10 years was living off alimony checks from my dad, which she still gets, and 1000 dollars a month from her own parents (my grandparents) which she still gets too. To supplement, she recently got a part time work from home job as an assistant for a nonprofit. It's a lot more work and hours than she expected and she hasn't worked in a long time, and isn't great with computers, so it's been really hard. I was helping her in the beginning but ended up doing a lot of the big tasks myself and she is busy herself and is also dating this guy who loves to do things and \"runs her ragged.\" And she is falling behind in her work.\n\nI end up doing hours of work for her a week, making spreadsheets, etc. And helping her do all sorts of things on the computer. I am now the one who does the bank transfers and accounting paperwork which has taken me many hours and the only one that knows how to use adobe (I had to teach myself) and she has asked me to do this task for her for a while. I don't mind helping her but I also write emails, schedule meetings for her and create all sorts of documents and spreadsheets. Sometimes I spend up to 4 hours a day on the projects and if I did them in the timeframe she asked I would be spending even more time I usually just get so tired I go to bed before finishing the spreadsheets. \n\nBut i feel I have no right to complain because if I was competent enough I wouldn't be living with her and I have failed to achieve normal developmental milestones as she reminds me frequently (I'm probably too sensitive though). I don't know what's wrong with me. I know i need to grow up and move out I'm not sure WHY that's so hard for me. I need to stop complaining. I think part of me feels good when I help my mom because I feel like I'm atoning or proving that I'm not entitled and lazy and incompetent. But then I am complaining on reddit, so who knows....? \n\nI do pay 525 dollars a month to her (well to a landlord who owns a store front/storage unit full of stuff that she is paying for). It's what I consider my \"rent,\" though it goes to paying for the storage unit. But even in Cleveland where I live, which is cheaper than most cities, it's impossible to live that cheaply and I should be grateful to be able to live with her. I'm not trying to complain. It's just a little tiring to constantly be doing things for other people when my own life is a mess.\n\nSometimes I just wish my mother didn't need my help so much so I wouldn't feel like I have to be available 24/7. But i'd probably be just as much of a \"failure\" if she was the perfect mother and I hate myself for making excuses. It's all probably on me and I'm not even communicating any of this to her. What do you think?",

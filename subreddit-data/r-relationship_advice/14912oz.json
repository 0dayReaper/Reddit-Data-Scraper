    "postText": "Me and my girlfriend have been together for 6 months now. We are not living together yet, and from her work to me it is a 24min train ride. She has no car. I have my own flat and she lives together with a roommate (female). It has been a rough ride in the beginning but we found our pace. When we meet, we have the best time together and we are both deeply in love with each other. But there are some things that aren't alright and I would like to get some adivise how to deal with the situation at hand right now.\n\nIn the beginning she slept at my place when she came over. During this time she also had a major test she had to prepare for, which totally engulfed her well-being and had effects on the relationship, since she is very consumed by things like that. I got the feeling that there is often times nothing else when she has something on her mind that is really bothering her. After the test she started to work at a new job. She hates it. And here comes the problem.\n\nThe negativity in her job seems to be very stressfull for her and I try to give my best to show her love and affection. Since it is summer I go out with her during the week, everytime to a new nature spot and other activities to ease her mind from the stress. It's always very nice and romantic. But at the beginning of the week she told me, that she needs time in the morning for herself to get fresh and fit for work and wants to work out. She told me that during the week she can't sleep at my place anymore, since it is stressfull for her and she says there is no coffe, make up, etc. for her routine. The weekends however would be fine. I said that we could find a compromisse and that she can store everything at my place.\n\nShe then started to get angry and told me that I don't understand her and that it was always stressfull for her in the morning at my place, since she had to go to work afterwards by train and had to take too many items with her that she needed for her morning routine. I was baffled and asked why she stayed at my place then and she told me that in the beginning she was affraid I wouldn't want her and she tried to make everything right. She has also some issue with me sleeping at her place because of her roommate, since she doesn't want her to hear us during sex. Furthermore, she doesn't really want to ride the train from work to my place anymore and it seems like she rather insist on me picking her up from her place. I told her we could find a compromise and that I would like at least one time per week to sleep together during the week. She then told me I'm egoistic and would only think about myself and not consider how she feels at work. I told her I often offered her to talk about it, but she said that it is a platitude.\n\nHow do I deal with this situation? I told her my needs on the phone and that I understand her, but that I have the feeling that I always have to bow down to her moods. Am I wrong for telling her? We are meeting later and I don't want any bad blood and resolve this issue in a constructive manner. Any tips?\n\nTLDR: Girldfriend is stressed, told me she doesn't want to sleep at my place during the week since she needs her morning routine and kinda didn't enjoy sleeping there during the weeks before because of work the next day. Weekends are fine. Tells me I am egoistic for suggesting a compromise since I would like at least one day of the week to sleep with her.",

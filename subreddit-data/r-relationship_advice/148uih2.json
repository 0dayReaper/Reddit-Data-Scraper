    "postText": "M24 F24 : I feel cheated by my GF\n\nBackground: I am a student busy preparing for competitive exam and my Gf works full time as a govt employee.\nSince september 2022, I started preparing for competitive exams, due to which the time I could allot for my Girl started getting reduced, and occasionally (i.e.twice or thrice) I had 1 week gap of not talking. Then comes december, I had to move out of my hometown to a larger city with better accessibility to resources in terms of examination, and my Girl also lived in this city. So the first week, I missed out on a concert of one of our favourite band, which Irked her. Everything was going on well from my side atleast for me till January end. Comes February 2023, I get more busier with my study and my girl gets less time. My girl did remind of this reduced time via text, to which I replied \u201cI\u2019ll be on time constraint atleast till 2024\u201d(which I\u2019ll regret later on). So things are going normal for me till now. \nIn February govt.job scam incident came to light where people were paying to get the job, to which there was huge protest all throughout the state and my Gf wanted me to support her cause, to which I replied that, I could see the POV of both the side i.e the protestors and the defenders ( defenders being the govt employee). She also used to occasionally send me instagram videos and one day it was about me being \u201cabsentee boyfriend\u201d to which I felt attacked and replied with just one word and stopped texting. 3 days later I get a letter stating that she\u2019s breaking up with me and wishes me the very best in my endeavour. Along with this letter was some eatable items, so I texted her saying \u201cthank you, i recieved the items\u201d to which there was no reply. I was still angry with her for no reply. A week passed by and on 21st march there was still no response from her, so I called her up and we talked for more than 3 hours and didn\u2019t get any indication of her wanting me to stay, so I tell her, this will be the last time we talk and then we slept away while talking. Fast forward to one month later, I called her back again wanting to reconcile and also regretting the mistakes I\u2019ve done, but I asked if she\u2019s already talking to someone else, I\u2019d understand and back off, to which she said no. So i started pursuing her again asking for another chance, to which she says, even she wants to try again, but the next day she mentions there\u2019s an online guy that she shares memes and songs, but doesn\u2019t know his name, face, address or anything. So I take it as some random guy not having to worry about. Then the next day I facetime her, then she says that she\u2019s also talking texting that guy at the same time, at this moment my mind gets fucked up. This shit continues for 3-4 days more and then the girl and me met up where I asked if there\u2019s nothing going on between the guy and you, you\u2019ll have to cut him if you wanna give us another shot, to which she replied that there\u2019s nothing going on, so i asked her to show the chats to which she says she cant because it\u2019d disappoint me. Me agreeing to her was the biggest mistake, but she agreed to inform the guy about not talking anymore. So in the evening, she goes to the bathroom for 15-20 mins, I get suspicious and my heart starts racing. She comes back and we slept right away, later in the morning I checked her phone and opened the gmail where I saw her telling the guy that \u201cshe owes him an explanation\u201d, i get so pissed off and I confront her to which she gets pissed off at me, but she does tell him that they\u2019ll have to cut conversation BECAUSE SHE\u2019S BACK IN THE RELATIONSHIP WITH ME, but that she liked talking to him. Next I tell her to unfollow that guy, to which she was very defensive and ultimately she unfollowed him. So the guy messages him asking him as to why she unfollowed him and that nothings going on between them. ( the incident about the guy messaging him was blurted out by her after I insisted on seeing their final text, to which she replied that \u201cshe deleted the text\u201d), this made me so pissed off and angry that I shouted at her for the first time and cried in front of her about how she\u2019s playing with me and the disrespect she has caused and cheating on me. We both cried and eventually made up to work out on this relationship. Post this her behaviour changed a bit, but now I am unable to trust her again and about how much trickling down has she done about the guy. \n\nDigging back at this guy, i find out that the guy has been replying to my girl\u2019s twitter post since february end and she has been replying back too, that too during late hours. And during our relationship, the guy entered into her dm asking for song suggestion to which she entertained him. And this bond gradually picked pace and became strong after the breakup. \n\nI feel cheated by my gf.\n\nNow I am in a position, where I am not able to leave nor stay peacefully.\n\nTLDR: I am student preparing for competitive exam and hence less time for GF, hence she decided to breakup. One month later I come back to reconcile and we do reconcile but only to find out that there is an online guy apparently whose name or face is unknown to my girl. I cant stay nor leave. Help reqd.\n\nIs there anyway to salvage this relationship? I still want this to work out.",

I think you should focus on your studies since they led to one week not talking (not even a single message?) and that ain't normal to me. I know you love her and she loves you but if she's seeking the attentions you can't give her from someone else then the relationship is doomed. Have a really serious talk about whether she's ok with the attention she receives or would need more. If you can't give it to her, let someone else do the job. It hurts but if your priority is study then you'll also have more time for It and less stress.",

    "postText": "Basically one of us earns a lot more than the other. \n\nOne of us believes it should be divided based on percentages of our incomes (for example if the divide of our overall income is 30-70 then a \u00a3100 bill would be split by the breadwinner paying \u00a370 and the other paying \u00a330). \n\nThe other believes it should be a straight 50/50 split no matter the income difference. \n\nI just wondered how others do it and reasons behind that? \nIs 50/50 fair? Or should be considered that one earns the lion share so can afford the support more of the weight of the bills?",

But if for a short time I covered the entire mortgage or whatever I wouldn\u2019t go break it down and be like \u201cum actually i now own 52.67% of the house\u201d \n\nIf you do anything other than 50/50 there likely should be some sort of contract in place. OP and boyfriend should each visit lawyers, make a contract that fits them and they agree on. Two lawyers helps each person be adequately protected.

The key is to pick a place where 20% of the mortgage/rent is affordable for the lower income party. \n\nThe reason to do this instead of 50/50 is that as a couple they can afford a much nicer place this way while still keeping the payment within budget for both parties. \n\nSay for example the most the 20k person can afford to pay per month is $500. Well, if they are doing 50/50 then the best they can afford is a place that costs $1,000/month. If they do percentage based, that could go up to $2,500/month.  The 80k person may be completely fine with 2k a month, so everyone is better off in this situation. \n\nThere isn't a one-size-fits-all answer, it is going to be dependant on each couples unique situation, but I think on average the percentage based method, taking into account that the resulting payment still has to be workable for each party, provides the best utility for the couple as a whole. \n\nNow, if the income percentage gets too distorted then it starts to get to the point where effectively the higher earner is going to be paying for everything one way or another.",

In practice the higher earner, especially if you get as skewed as 80/20, is going to pick up virtually all expenses for things like vacation, dates, eating out, little expenditures here and there, etc, that go a long way towards bridging that \"fairness\" gap you mention. \n\nWhere I think there is a difference, philosophically, between a personal relationship such as this and say, a federal taxation policy, is that love can distort a lot. A valid argument, in my opinion, against too progressive of a taxation system is that the higher earners are bigger flight risks. If you try to tax the rich too severely, they go somewhere else. There are many countries that have experienced this sort of taxation flight from high earners. Even in a relationship, there will (I think especially in today's world) be some flight risk for the higher earner. Why bother being with someone you have to backpack instead of someone who can help pull the sled with you? Love is of course the answer to that, but too big a difference there will be a constant strain. \n\nI digress. In summary, I just think the percentage split is an excellent starting baseline to figure out a good target price range for something like rent, so that the burden of rent is exactly the same percentage of income for each partner. Use it as a start for those biggest shared expenses and also establishing savings goals, and then adjust as each individual circumstance dictates. The utility skew can be made up in other areas of expenditure that end up shouldered by the higher earner. \n\nAnyway, I appreciate the thoughtful response and dialogue!",

You can split 50/50 but rule of thumb is when you do it that way, you respect the standard of living that the lower income earner can afford. This might mean not eating out, not going on vacations, etc. If you were married, I'd say split it 70/30, but unless you guys are legally bound, then 50/50 is going to be better.

Marriage has no effect on the type of joint ownership of property in the UK. \n\nIf a married couple buy a home, it's usual for them to own it under joint tenancy. However if they want to, they can decide to own it as tenants in common, with an even or uneven split. \n\nSimilarly if an unmarried couple buy a home together as tenants in common and then get married, the marriage doesn't override the tenants in common agreement. The couple may decide to change to a joint tenancy arrangement, they may not, but it's entirely up to them. The unmarried couple may also decide to own as a joint tenancy from the get go. \n\nOn divorce, the tenants in common arrangement can be overridden by the judge when dividing assets, but this will ultimately depend on the facts of the case. An uneven split would probably be upheld if you divorce after a short time, have no kids to take care of and it can be shown the split is reasonable (i.e. If one partner contributed a significant lump sum when purchasing the property). However if you're divorcing after 20 years, there are children to consider, there have been periods of unemployment for either of you where the other has carried the can.. The judge may well override the tenants in common split to ensure the marital assets are distrubuted fairly.\n\nPre/post nups aren't legally binding, but they can be taken into account - again, it depends on fairness and the facts of the specific case.\n\nTl;Dr - Ultimately, yes there is a risk when married that assets are not split in the same proportion as you contributed financially/same proportion as agreed, but that's down to UK divorce law rather than the method of joint ownership a couple chooses.",

Say they can afford half the down payment and monthly payments if the house is $200K or less. Then if the higher earner would prefer to buy a house that's more expensive, they pay the difference (and own more of the house). If they both agree on how to budget for housing as a percent of income, that will end up being a similar split to the 70/30 proportion, but if they don't, they each get to budget how they prefer. \n\nIt gets really problematic if the higher earner is fine living within the lower earner's means, but the lower earner still wants a proportional split (either to spend even less on housing or trying to get their partner to spend more on housing, so they can live somewhere they otherwise couldn't afford) or if the higher earner wants to live a lifestyle in line with their income but wants a 50/50 split. But in most cases, the reason the proportional split makes sense is because the higher earner doesn't want to live within the lower earner's means.",

You choose your housemate because you both agree on living within a certain range for your housing budget. There's also no expectation of actually having a life with your housemate. There's no problem if your housemate goes on holiday 6 times a year as long as they pay their share.\n\nWith a partner, there's an expectation that you'll do things together and buy things together and those things cost money. If person X makes 30K a year and person Y makes 70K, it's crazy to say they should both put 20K per year towards a mortgage, even if that's the most partner X can afford.",

If you're married, and split up, there are a detailed set of rules by which a judge can determine what is an equitable split of the property.  If you're not, then it can be the wild west out there trying to even get the other person to move out or keep paying their share when they live there. \n\nThat being said, if you plan on doing it anyway, here is my opinion. In most cases, I would day there is a case to be made for either method as long as one person is not being put in undue financial distress. I understand why some people do it proportionate to income because then you're putting in equal time (i.e. hours of work) and effort, and just get different income yields from that time. I understand why some people decide on 50/50, because after all you're both getting the same things out of the house and utilities, so the value to each of you is the same. You just have to set your expectations and budget based on the lower earner. My husband and I do a proportional split on monthly bills/groceries and go 50/50 on repairs, upgrades and other larger expenses for the home. We each pay our own personal bills, and he tends to do more recreational spending for us as a couple. \n\nThe purchase of a house, though, makes it a tricky thing.  This isn't rent.  This is equity you're building in an asset. Depending on the laws where you live, joint owners may have equal entitlement to the equity in an asset they own, even if one contributed far less.  If that's the case here, then it really wouldn't make sense for someone to put down 70% of the mortgage payments and the down payment, knowing that a large chunk of that money would be awarded to the other person if they split and had to sell.  If the law guarantees people get back proceeds of the sale in the same %'s as they contributed to the equity, then either would work for this as well.",

When one is married and settled down, this kind of breakdown falls away and the dynamics change from month to month.

It's pretty unlikely that a couple with income disparity are going to live at the lower persons income/lifestyle level (where 50/50) would be fair so it makes sense to split based on income somewhat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are other ways of splitting bills fairly - I think the most important thing is that both parties feel comfortable with that division whatever the basis. For example some people have a joint account with set amounts contributed. Sometimes the higher earner might completely cover some bills/expenses.\n\nThere is a lot of context but I think its about both parties being comfortable with the division. Personally again I know its a stretch but a higher earner pushing for 50/50 is a bit of a red flag (unless they couple are 100% genuinely living the lower earners lifestyle if that makes sense)\n\nAs others have said a very clear property agreement is vital in this sort of situation.",

By splitting based on income percentages, we could afford to rent a nicer apartment and buy a nicer house.  If we had split 50-50, I simply could not have afforded a more expensive place or a nicer house.\n\nA 50-50 split is unfair to the person with a significantly lower income, particularly of the higher earning person wants more expensive stuff because they make more money.\n\nWe set up a joint account and joint credit card.  We paid all the household bills from the joint account and joint credit card.  We did a quick budget to determine our monthly joint expenses, and that included going out to dinner or the movies or vacations.  We then contributed to the joint account enough money to cover the joint expenses based on our incomes.  Whatever was left over was our own money to spend as we each wished.  That was great because then he wasn\u2019t complaining when I went to the day spa and I wasn\u2019t complaining when he bought some high end gizmo\u2026",

I would definitely recommend having a cohabitation agreement to split equity on the home if you two separate for whatever reason. Even if you don't think you will, it's better for peace of mind too. In my case, we split any house related bills 50/50 (mortgage, condo fees, utilities), and pay for our personal ones ourselves (car insurance, phone). If we split up, our agreement is that we sell our home, reimburse ourselves for our down payment contribution, and the remaining equity is split 50/50. \n\nPersonally, I feel like grouping things into home vs personal expenses is key. Splitting housing expenses 50/50 is more fair, while personal ones should be each person's responsibility unless you decide otherwise",

Our split worked out to 29-71.  Think about it this way:  let's say one of you makes 100k and the other makes 500k.  If you use a 50-50 split, your housing options are limited by what the party who makes less can afford half of.\n\nFollowing a standard 28/36 rule (meaning you should spend only up to 28% of your gross income on housing and up to 36% on total debts repayment), that puts the 100k person  at a max of $2333 for a mortgage, and the 500k person at $11665.  Since y'all are splitting, half each of those numbers.  So the 100k person is around $1600, and the 500k person around $5800.\n\nRight off the bat, the range of houses which would have mortgages at $1600 and at $5800 is huge.  So let's assume a $5000 mortgage.  How is it fair to make the 100k person pay $2500 which is over the full 28% the should max out on their own?\n\nBut you know what? I'm gonna take a chance here and tell you something you *really* need to hear before you continue this discussion:\n\nBuying property together - ANY kind of property: land, house, vehicle, even a *dog* \\- without being legally married is a huge recipe for disaster, and I hope you come to your senses before you even attempt it.\n\nWhy is it a disaster?  Because neither of you will have ANY legal recourse should you have a disagreement over the property, or god forbid - you break up.  I know I know - he's totally The One and you will be with him forever - but you know everyone thinks that, right?  Sh\\*t happens, and there's nothing wrong with being prepared for it.\n\nSo back to the courts:  they do NOT recognize bf/gf, bf/bf, gf/gf, situationships, FWBs, or \"it's complicated\"'s. They recognize **marriage**, and the laws with respect to division of property jointly owned by a **married couple** are usually pretty clear.  But without being married, a judge is going to say: \"sell it, and split the proceeds\", but he can't compel either of you legally to do that.  So if one person doesn't want to sell and gets stubborn and won't be bought out - there is simply *nothing* the other party can do.\n\nSo please, do your research.  Understand that marriage has more to it than just romance - it has legal binding, and legal binding with regard to division of property in the event of a split.  You will get NONE of that if you do this and you aren't married.\n\nIf you plan on staying with him and he plans on staying with you - then why not get married first?  That's nearly as much commitment as buying a house.  Don't entertain the fantasy that your relationship is perfect and you will never split up and he's absolutely perfect and you know him and he would never do that, etc., because again, it's a universal truth: sh\\*t happens, just like rainy days happen.  Nothing wrong with buying an umbrella.\n\nGood luck, my girl.",

            "comment": "I think proportional splits make way more sense than 50/50 in romantic cohabitation.\n\nRoommates: 50/50, everyone is severally liable for their expenses. If your roommate wants to do our buy something outside your budget, you just don\u2019t do or buy that thing. Not a big deal, roommates don\u2019t fully share their lives.\n\nRomantic cohabitation: proportional to income, partners share in expenses and fun money equitably. Vacations, outings, and big expenses are shared decisions.\n\nIn a dating relationship, 50/50 has only 4 outcomes:\n\n1. Higher earner lives well below their means and ends up with a lot of savings. They benefit from the split expenses (housing costs halved, food costs reduced) *plus* they end up with financial security the lower earner cannot reach.\n2. Higher earner has expenses well below their means and spends the excess on fun. Again, they benefit from the split expenses and also are constantly rubbing their partner\u2019s face in the wealth disparity, as they can afford vacations and luxuries.\n3. Lower earner lives beyond their means and struggles paycheck-to-paycheck or falls into debt. It\u2019s really common for the midpoint to be set right at the top of what the lower earner can afford, without considering potential new future expenses or income interruptions. In this scenario the higher earner is still usually saving or splurging to some degree, too.\n4. Higher earner ends up paying for all or most of the luxuries (vacations, dinners out, pricier gifts, replacing big-ticket items like furniture or electronics) so they end up in a functionally-proportional split where the higher earner has control over luxury spending and the power to stop at any time, while the lower earner cannot predict how money will be spent and is expected to be eternally grateful.\n\nI think these are all essentially bad outcomes, but the worst is option 4 and I suspect it (or a mix of 3 and 4) is the most common. When the agreement is 50/50 but the reality is that the higher earner wants to be generous with their money, the higher earner is creating a coercive dynamic that is just gross even if they don\u2019t intend to abuse it. If you really don\u2019t intend to take advantage of a power imbalance, why deliberately create one? Just agree to a proportional split in advance. The truth is a lot of people want that power imbalance because it makes them feel safe, and they don\u2019t interrogate what they want to be safe from (feeling taken advantage of and/or taken for granted, usually).\n\nI don\u2019t think separate finances make any sense in the vast majority of marriages, because most marriages are between a man and a woman and produce children, which permanently and severely impacts women\u2019s lifetime earnings. Also, income incurred in the course of a marriage is legally shared, and in divorce will be split 50/50 no matter how it was earned. Most women sacrifice income in favour of unpaid work that allows their male partners to earn more, and legal marriage recognizes that disparity.\n\nRelatedly, I don\u2019t think it ever makes sense to buy a primary home with someone you\u2019re not married to. In most places/situations, if you are married, the marital home is legally equally owned by both, the income is legally equally owned by both, and the proceeds from the sale of the house are legally equally owned by both. A dating relationship has zero legal framework, which means **you need to have a lawyer draw up a cohabitation agreement** that makes clear:\n\n1. Who owns what share of the house?\n2. Who owns what share of the proceeds from the sale of the house?\n3. What happens if one of you stops paying (due to disability, caretaking, job loss, just being an asshole)?\n4. Who pays for what share of emergency maintenance costs?\n5. Who pays for what share of optional improvements to the house, and how are these improvements decided on?\n6. What happens to the house if you break up (buy out, forced sale, cohabitating)?\n7. What happens if one or both of you dies? (Generally if one dies the other inherits sole ownership of the house, but it\u2019s possible for one of you to end up co-owning with the deceased\u2018s parents.)\n8. Under what circumstances will those details be changed?\n\nMy recommendation would actually be that the higher earner purchase the house without the lower earner, charge the lower earner an agreed upon rent (with a lease agreement), and be solely responsible for maintenance and renovation costs.",

Or you can do a third option and that's to say who pays what bills. The person who makes more can afford to pay more bills and could be something like this:\n\nPerson 1 (who makes more)\n-water/sewage/trash\n-internet\n-gas and electric\n\nPerson 2 (who makes less)\n-streaming services\n-groceries\n\nAnything that puts equity into the house is a 50/50 split no matter what.

There is no longer the concern around who is paying for a meal or a movie because we've already split it up.

By default you may be limiting the range of houses available to you. \n\nIn contrast, if the higher earner wants a nicer house, but the lower earner can\u2019t afford 50%, the higher earner should then take over a larger portion of the bills in order to live in that house. In this case, I think they should get a proportionate amount of equity as well, so if you sell the house, or rent it out, they get a proportional amount of the profit relative to the amount that they initially put down.\n\nYou can also probably negotiate and find acceptable terms for both parties that are in-between\u2014or outside of\u2014these possibilities. \n\nIf you\u2019re the lower earner, and building equity is important to you, you might value having a 50% stake in the property and bills, because you\u2019ll build more equity than in the 30% case. In contrast, if you prefer having more disposable income while building less equity/taking less risk, you might be okay with doing less than 50%. Similar considerations/lines of thinking around risk, reward, and disposable income can be made for the higher earner. \n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s one right solution. You two should think about what you each value and then negotiate acceptable terms. Probably (I\u2019m no expert).",

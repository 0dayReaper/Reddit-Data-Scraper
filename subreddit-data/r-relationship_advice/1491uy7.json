    "postText": "I (25M) have been married to my wife (35F) for only a few months, but have been in an off again on again relationship for over 5 years now. For context, I am autistic. Basic human communication, common tasks and other such a things have always been hard for me. I would rather quietly sit in the back then have an uncomfortable conversation and I admit that I need reminding regularly for tasks others find easy. Things that other people understand naturally, I can't quite grasp. I admit that I have limitations in this life, but I've grown to accept them. After all, I can't change who I am.\n\nMy wife had two kids before I came along and we had a third. I love my family and I love my wife more than anything, but I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't think she knows that I know all of this, but let me try to explain.\n\nShe acts distant, refusing to show any sort of affection. Despite the fact that this is something that I crave. At first I thought this was just how she was raised. Her parents apparently never really showed affection or talked and that's the only way that she knows how to communicate. However, things have been getting worse and worse. I didn't understand. She was angry every day, finding little things that I hadn't done and completely making her opinion about me that day on that. I tried doing what she wanted, working hard all day to keep the house clean. I admit that I'm not the greatest housekeeper, but even when I had the house looking great, she was mad at me. Something I had forgotten, something I said or the fact that I didn't really Force the kids to do chores. She never seems happy with me. She's all smiles and laughs everywhere else, but as soon as I come around it's like all the joy has been sucked out of her life. I thought maybe I was overthinking it, but I know I'm wrong. I know she thinks everything.\n\nShe left her phone out and I looked through the messages. She was talking with one of her old friends, telling them how she wish she had a normal life and a normal husband. She was talking about wanting to scream. She told him that I can barely take care of myself, when I'm the one who stays at home to watch the kids so she can work. I admit that I have troubles sometimes, but I was always taught that so long as I try it would be enough. Like really try. I have been doing that, but she even told this guy that she doesn't want me to hold her, kiss her or love on her because she doesn't understand how I can't handle basic tasks. She knew that I was autistic when we married. I feel like I'm losing my mind. At this point, I feel like no matter how hard I try it will never be enough for her. I sleep on the couch, she's always angry with me and I get blamed for everything. I'm in tears as I write this because For the first Time in years I feel like dying. I look at every bottle of pills anything that it would be real nice to swallow them. I'm losing my mind. All I want is to be good enough. I've never been good enough. No matter how hard I try. She finds every excuse to stay away from me, completely uncaring about how much that hurts. I understand that I'm not normal. Things that should be easy are so difficult. Why on Earth do I have to be like this? And if she hates me so much, then why did she get married? I'm not rich or anything else. I don't understand. Am I overthinking this? What's going on? What can I do to make things better? Please tell me.",

            "comment": "Oof. So. A few things. There\u2019s an unhealthy power dynamic here. She\u2019s much older, meaning she\u2019s in a different point in life. She is the one working, so she has control over the money. Like, there\u2019s not an equitable exchange happening here, and she knows exactly who and how you are, but she\u2019s trying to punish you into being something else.\n\nAba, or applied behavior analysis works on a similar principle. It punishes autistic people for Autistic reactions and actions, like stemming or being overstimulated. **It doesn\u2019t work** it worsens mental health, increases risk of suicide, it also forces autistic people to try and be neurotypical. She knew you were autistic, she was aware, she chose to marry you, and now it\u2019s a problem. You all have had 5 years for her to learn this. She doesn\u2019t want to offer you support, she wants you to be neurotypical. Your brain is literally built different, and she wants to change that.\n\nYes people in support roles can get burn out. They can be exhausted. This is not that. This is abusive and toxic.\n\nYou are a whole man, who may function a little differently than some other people, but that doesn\u2019t mean you are less than or lacking in any way. This is a type of abuse autistic people suffer, and what she is doing to you is the same thing as a therapy that has ended up with thousands of autistic deaths. \n\nYou cannot do anything to make this better, because it\u2019s not a you problem. If she\u2019s unhappy with your cleaning she could hire a maid, not torment you until you are suicidal, but she doesn\u2019t, because it\u2019s not about the maid, it\u2019s about controlling and changing you.",

Look forward in your life and ask yourself if you're able to forgive that, if she flipped a switch and everything was wonderful starting today. Would you hold it against her in your heart?\n\nYou cannot take action you'll find satisfying, no matter how painful, until you are certain about whether or not there's any purpose to trying to fix the relationship or not.",

I just want it to stop. I want her to stop being angry all the time. I know it's selfish, but I wish she just understood me a little better. She knew I was different when we got into this relationship, so I thought that she would be okay with me, but I guess I was wrong. If it all switched today I would be fine, but it's not fine right now.",

            "comment": "I would look for couple counseling, preferably with someone who has training in understanding autism.\n\nSomething isn't working and communication has completely broken down between you two. But it's not us on our couches that will be able to parse the inner workings of your relationship. Is she unreasonable in her expectations? Are you hiding behind your diagnostic to avoid taking your fair share of the relationship's mental load? We ain't gonna figure that out on a message board like reddit with just one side of the story. The fact your relationship has always been a rocky one, and that she started dating you when you were 20 and she was 30 is also painting all sorts of pictures.\n\nSo yeah, tell her you see she is unhappy in your relationship and you're unhappy to feel her disappointment every day, so you wish to find practical solutions to make things work. And maybe you need a professional mediator for that, so that you can understand each other's point of view and communicate better.",

She probably hat a very strong independent ex and now found a \"lap dog\" who doesn't say much, because of his illness and his youth. Now she probably realizes her mistake.\n\nYou are surely a great guy, but you shouldn't stay with her, she is not good for you or anybody.",

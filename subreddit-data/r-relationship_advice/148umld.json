    "postText": "\n\nAs the title suggests, I got a text from my ex today, we broke up 2 months ago but we did keep contact for the first month until one day we had a huge fight and I just lost it because of the way she hurt me, I was overwhelmed and angry, so she blocked me and we never spoke again. \n\nI accepted that this is it and decided to move on, one month passed since that fight and today she texts me asking how I am doing and said that she was meaning to text me in the last couple of days and that she hates how we left things. she apologized for the pain she caused me and that she values the friendship and relationship we had so much and hates how we left things. \n\nWe were together for 3 years and by the end of it she really hurt me so I decided to end things.  For context she hid the fact the her ex reached out to her and tried to deny it but I found out they had been talking for a day or two. \n\nI did not reply and I am not planning to as I was really hurt I really can\u2019t stand lying and hiding, and decided to put myself first. But at the same time I do not want to seem like an immature person. \n\nI would be lying if I said I am a 100% over her, I find myself trying to understand what she meant by that message and if she misses me, and this is where I am genuinely lost. Should I reply or ignore\u2026 \n\nSo fellow redditors would appreciate your advice on this .",

It was hard in the beginning but after this month things are much better, just confusion after she reached out and thinking about what are her intentions.

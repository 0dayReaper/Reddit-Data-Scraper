As much as it pained me to do so I decided to do the right thing. Pam should know that my brother is cheating on her. \n\nI decided to give Jim a chance. I called him and told him that, I can\u2019t keep this secret. It was tearing me up inside to do so. I couldn\u2019t think about anything else. I told him I loved him so much but I couldn\u2019t let him do this to someone else I loved like family. He begged me to reconsider. He didn\u2019t try to guilt me or anything. But he did say that he needs his younger brother to just be there for him. I told him I couldn\u2019t. I asked him what he would want if it was me getting cheated on, or our little sister getting cheated. He said that he understood that it\u2019s wrong but he was just exploring himself. I told him that thats no excuse. I told him, that he had until that evening to tell Pam, and if he didn\u2019t I would have to. We then hung up and I just waited. \n\nAt 11pm I called Pam and stuck up a normal conversation. I asked her how things were with my brother, she said it was all fine and that, they\u2019re thinking about having kids. I really couldn\u2019t believe my brother made me do this but I had to tell her. I told her that what I saw. She was livid she refused to believe me. Luckily I was able to show her the screenshot of my brother being in someone else\u2019s bed. She then told me she needed to hang up. \n\nI haven\u2019t heard anything from my brother. But as of today, Pam is leaving him. So I guess that\u2019s good, she won\u2019t have to be hurt by him like that, and I can be there for her. My brother hasn\u2019t answered any of my calls or texts, so I don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll talk again.\n\nAt least I still have Pam and my sister I guess.",

You not only saved Pam from an awful marriage but you potentially saved kids from being brought into a dysfunctional family, which can cause so many different problems for the child. You did the right thing.",

It messed up her mental health and I have been parenting both of them since I was 12. I finally set boundaries when I was in nursing school and couldn't take anymore of their bullshit. We all have a much better relationship now and I am working on my own mental health and ability to trust. Thank you for not being too scared to leave.",

The sort of traumatic childhood you guys had affects people in different ways. I don\u2019t believe he can stay angry with you for his own misaligned moral compass. Hopefully, this will be one of those hard won life lessons and he will be able to go on to have healthy love relationships. Just love him, give him some space, and hopefully he will take responsibility.",

But the dude's only been married TWO YEARS. What the hell does he need to explore about himself in someone else's vagina.\n\nYou did this the right way. You confronted him, you warned him, you explained your viewpoint, and you followed through with the consequence. You gave him a shot and he didn't take it. He let his wife down in a big way, and he let you down by putting you in a no-win position. This is something he has brought upon all of you. Not his wife, and not you.",

Years later it started again and while I knew in my gut something was going on with a female friend of his, I could never prove it bc he got good at hiding his tracks. It took me almost 3 years before I got proof. The suspicions were off and on not constant. We would have times where he seemed to stop seeing her or talking to her. Anyway. So when I finally out he had just ended that affair and started a new one. We separated for over 6 months. I had our 3rd baby during that time. I was livid he would cheat at all, let alone while I was pregnant. Then I found out there was some friends and family that knew all along. And most of these friends and family also knew all along that I was suspicious and still decided to keep it from me. It hurt me. On top of being cheated on by someone I had been with since I was 15 (31 at the time all this happened), my friends and family decided to hurt me further by overlooking his actions just to avoid hurting him. I don't talk to most of them now. So you did the right thing by telling her. She deserved to know. And if she found out later you knew you could have lost a friend. Your brother did something wrong not your friend. And he has to face that at some point. My ex and I ended up trying one more time to reconcile but this past February I learned the second affair had never ended, and on top of that I learned it wasn't just those 2. It had been many, emotional and physical, over the last 6+ years. It was devastating. But knowing is better. The longer it goes on the more it hurts knowing they could lie to your face that long. Not to mention the repeated risk of STDs he put me in. I know it's hard for your brother to be upset with you but I think you would have caused yourself alot of regret later if you kept his secret. Family doesn't get a pass on right and wrong. In time your brother will realize you did what you had to and that he put you guys in this position to begin with. Good luck. Things will get better. They are just tense right now because there is a lot of negative emotion for everyone involved.",

I have spent my adult life focusing only on being a wife and a mom and pushing myself to the back. Not that I didn't love being a wife and a mom. And I still make my kids my priority of course. But I was a stay at home mom because it was easier so when everything happened I felt so lost. No work experience in years and at the start of a lockdown and pandemic so that was a bummer. And it took awhile but now months later I am putting my feelings first. I have a good job. I use to deliver newspaper from 16-22 and my mom is the regional manager so I did have a good foot in the door having experience with the business and a mom who is the boss. But I got the opportunity to take an assistant district manager position and I'm good at it because I enjoy it and dealt with it from the other side for years. The pay is decent. I get paid for 8 hours whether I work 8 hours or 2 hours (on call technically when I'm home and can do alot from my laptop at home). So it works well being a single mom with 3 kids hour wise. And I've just generally improved myself overall I feel like. And I continue to do so. \n\nI also have dealt with fielding the constant questions like \"why are you still so civil with him?\" \"Why are not mad at the girls? At least the ones who knew he was married? I would want to beat their ass!\". Well it's simple. As far as he goes, we still have kids together and I grew up with parents who hated each other and were awful to each other and it really hurt me. As much as I might hate what happened, he is still their dad and I won't do anything that hurts my kids. They are innocent and he is still a good dad. As far as the girls, yeah as a decent human being the ones who knew he was married, some respect would have been nice. But they didn't owe me anything. He did. We weren't friends or anything. They didn't owe me the respect or consideration if they didn't want to. The only person who owed me anything was the one who made the vows. That's where the blame lies. \n\nSo it's not always easy. And I have to work daily to keep my emotions in check to handle things in a way that doesn't hurt my kids and doesn't keep drawing things out for me. I just try to focus on doing right by my kids and continuing to improve myself. I owe myself that. And I feel very proud of what I've accomplished so far. Sorry that got so long!!",

What really hurt my Mom was when she found out that her youngest brother (my uncle) whom lived with us for a few years, whom she basically treated like her oldest kid, KNEW for a few years and never told her. \n\n\n\n\nI remember her telling me that one night, my uncle came home and my dad came in a few minutes later, and it was obvious that they had gotten into a fist fight. When she questioned them both, neither would tell her what it was about. My uncle admitted years later that he'd confronted my Dad about telling her and that's what led to the fight. She kinda brushed it off around him but I know that it really messed with her to know that her own brother knew for a long time and never said a word. \n\n\n\n\nYou did the right thing. You also gave your brother the opportunity to do the right thing but he refused. Not your problem. If I were in the same position, I'd have done the same as you. I've been with my husband for 7 years, married almost 2. I can only hope that if my best friend or a close family member knew my husband was cheating that they'd tell me. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe fact that she mentioned they were thinking about having kids further solidifies that you did the right thing. You potentially saved her from years of a miserable, loveless marriage and kids caught in the crossfire.",

I asked her how things were with my brother, she said it was all fine and that, they\u2019re thinking about having kids.\n\nOP, I am so glad you did this before kids were involved. You saved everyone so much pain. I'm sorry your brother is being a giant chode and put you in such a horrible position.",

            "comment": "I can relate to this so much. I had a situation where my male best friend and my female best friend were in a relationship, he cheated on her and told me about it because he felt bad and needed someone to talk. Obviously he begged me not to tell her. It wasn't an affair, just a one time thing (not like that's any better, just to give the entire picture). I carried this around for quite some time without saying anything. It felt bad.\n\nThey eventually broke up for other reasons, but he tried to get her back since he still loved her. At some point I was just casually talking to my female bf. The convo shifted to her ex/my best friend and that she's uncertain if she might give him another chance, since apparently she still had some feelings aswell. That was the point where I couldn't hold it anymore and told her what happened during their former relationship. Obvious outcome: She didn't give him another chance. I asked her not to say anything about me telling it to her, but rather wanted to do that myself, which I did. He was furious at me, understandably. But eventually he reflected himself and realized in what kind of shitty situation he put me in and apoligized.\n\nThis has was 15 years ago. Him and I are still best friends in our mid to late 30's.\n\nLong story short: If your brother loves you and is a good person, once time makes his anger fade, he'll be able to see what position you were in and will understand what you've done, and that it was the only right thing to do. He'll get over it and a few years down the line, he probably won't even think, let alone talk about it anymore.\n\nRight move OP, you'll be fine. Best wishes.",

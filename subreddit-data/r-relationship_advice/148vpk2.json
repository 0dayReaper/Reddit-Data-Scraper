    "postText": "TL;DR: My girlfriend cheated on me twice, and recently kissed another guy multiple times. She claims to want to rebuild our relationship, but admits to having feelings for the other guy. I'm torn and need advice on what to do next.\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI'm in a complicated situation in my relationship and could really use some guidance. My girlfriend and I have been together since 2016, but we've faced challenges due to her infidelity. She cheated on me twice, once in 2017 and again in February 2023.\n\nRecently, I discovered that she kissed another guy multiple times after using her dog's death as an excuse. We're currently in a long-distance relationship, and she says she wants to work on rebuilding our connection. However, she also admits to still having feelings for the other guy.\n\nI'm struggling to make a decision, and I've given her an ultimatum. Should I continue trying to salvage our relationship despite her lingering emotions for this other guy? Or would it be better to walk away and find someone who can fully commit to our relationship?\n\nI'd greatly appreciate any advice, insights, or personal experiences you can share. Please help me navigate this difficult situation and decide on the best course of action.\n\nThank you all in advance.",

You already dragged this on for 6 years when you should have broken up in 2017 the first time it happened. You make your life toxic and complicated when you keep toxic and complicated things around you. Life is so much simpler if you cut it off and not drag the toxicity with you. Cause the reality is in you are pretty much no different from an open relationship just without the consent. I don't see why you want to be in something you don't really intend to be in. The biggest issue I think is you need therapy. The fact you cannot let go of toxic things in your life is making you very toxic. It seems like a codependency issue. You aren't going to have healthy relationships with a toxic mindset. Get out of the relationship and start rehabbing your mind and life. Otherwise you are just on a complicated, toxic roller coaster ride.",

The only way to rebuild the relationship is to break all contact with the other guy.  If she is unwilling to do that, she is in fact not really willing to rebuild anything.  By her own admission she is not going to rebuild the relationship.  You are being strung along as a backup plan.  \n\nAlso, what she wants is irrelevant at this point.  You are under no obligation to extend anything to her.  The real question is what do you want?\n\nDon't you deserve a faithful partner that puts you before all other people.  She has proven time and time again that she won't do that.  Hell, she has basically told you she has no intention of doing it EVEN now!  \n\nDump her.  Block her.  Go to therapy and get your mind unfucked and learn to have self respect and see your own self-worth again.",

This isn't hard to think about. The next step is to break up and cut ties. Do not write her after the break up. Block all access for her to contact you. And you know what you do afterwards?  You get better in terms of physique so you can attract a 10/10 girl who's 21. You have to get your confidence back. That what you should do.",

She always says to me that she is a victim. No one understands that. when I say to her that I never give up on her when last time she cheated on me. She is like, \"After my dog died, there is emptyness in my life. You are not with me because we are in a long distance relationship. This guy came to me and I am alive because of that mistake. Because that guy talk to her she did not commit suicide. Please help me. This is the whole situation that she is saying to me, and if some of them are true or even all of them are true, should I consider forgiving her? Or still, all of you believe that she is a cheater and it cannot be changed and she cannot improve because I never met another girl in my life. I am always loyal to her. I am not going to lie to you, but I am still in love with her. I am not sure if I should give her a chance. Some part of me wants to give her a chance. Some part of me is saying that I am a fool and that I should work on myself. Whatever she's saying is all lie she's saying is just to get me back , and to win my trust back, I am asking you again\u00a0 please advise me. Bye the way, thank you so much all of your coments mean lot to me.",

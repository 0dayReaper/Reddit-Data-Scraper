    "postText": "So here\u2019s a lot of information but I need advice because this is such a specific situation. Im 27 and my girlfriend is 26, my mom has been planning a trip for us and her and my dad to go visit some family in another state. My family that we\u2019re visiting has 2 young children middle school and like 3rd grade. Also another fact that adds to this is I\u2019m a teacher and definitely like my alone time (my cousins love me and will constantly trying to do something).\n\nHere\u2019s the issue: my gf and I want to stay in a hotel but we are dealing with having to avoid offending them. My mom keeps saying they\u2019ll be offended if we don\u2019t stay with them and that they have a big house and that will be good hosts. While I understand and believe that, my gf and I really will be needing privacy especially staying with 2 families and children. Are we being difficult with this? Since I am an underpaid, stressed teacher my vacations are meant for relaxing. Of course I\u2019m down to visit family and places, but the 24hr being with everyone and having all of these plans made to keep the kids and everyone entertained is stressing me out. I definitely need to keep talking to my mom about how like we don\u2019t want to be waited on or expected to always join everything.. I (we) need advice!",

You're her child whose out of state, of course she is going to say that to you.\n\nBy no means I am taking her side, but can you blame her? Moms are obsessive. \n\nYou're an adult. You're free to make your own decisions. Your mom will get over it if you don't spend 24/7 with them. \n\nI get it... I've been with a teacher for a long time, I know how valuable vacation time is. After dealing with kids for months on end, you want your peace and quiet. \n\nTell your mom like it is. Thanks for the offer, but we would prefer to get a hotel. We have other plans that we want to do but we will make a significant effort to spend time with everyone. \n\nYou got to put your foot down and come up with some type of stance, then stick to it. If there is friction, so be it. She will accept it.",

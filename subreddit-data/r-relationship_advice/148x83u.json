    "postText": "Hi reddit. I\u2019m currently working as a consultant. My hours at work are kinda long and stretch from 10 am-12 am. I have 3 peers, we\u2019re all supervised by a manager. \n\nLast night as i was signing off, a coworker called me. The manager had just talked to her and she was checking if the manager had been acting this way with me and the other guy. All 3 of us agreed that things had been toxic at work and we were discussing how to raise it. \n\nWhile we were having this discussion, my girlfriend called me. She had sent me 10 texts which i had missed because i was on a call. I cut her call after which she called me repeatedly. I texted her, \u201chey im on a critical work call, ill call you back\u201d. After this she texted me with who to which i replied \u201con a call with coworker F, things are not well at work. She is giving up\u201d \n\nOnce i said this, My girlfriend started calling me again and again. I picked up on 3rd/4th ring. When i picked up she said \u201cI\u2019m calling you on teams, id like to listen\u201d. I said ok, put her on teams while i was on phone call. \n\nWhile she was listening to the conversation she goes ahead and says \u201cyou\u2019re just talking to coworker F. You\u2019re cheating on me\u201d. I told her \u201cit was a conference call, the 3rd guy dropped, he had work.\u201d To this she responds \u201cput me on conference, id like to talk to her\u201d. I was like \u201cwhy?!\u201d And she was like i would like to confirm if it was a conference call. I say ok and i call the coworker and put on conference. \n\nAs soon as i put her and my coworker on conference my girlfriend says \u201cwhy do you call him so late, it\u2019s unprofessional\u201d (she had called me after 8 pm once more because the manager was being toxic to the entire team) to which my coworker takes a lot of offense and starts shouting. There\u2019s a lot of shouting in this conference call and the coworker hangs up. \n\nThe coworker has refused to work with me now and my girlfriend has broken up with me saying that i was cheating on her because i was providing emotional support to a coworker. \n\nI personally don\u2019t understand how all of this escalated so fast. I think we have this culture at work that you mutually crib with your peers when you have a toxic superior and on top of that, i was loyal to my girlfriend because I haven\u2019t had any personal conversation with this coworker yet. \n\nRedditors, what should i do in such a situation?",

You shouldn't have let your GF join the call because it was obvious that your GF was seething with insecurities that were not under control at that point (so it shouldn't have been a suprise that she didn't exactly behave herself).\n5. Your GF also has no place in the company work chat if she is not employed by your employer.\n6. If this coworker was genuinely looking for emotional support, then the moment you let your angry jealous GF into the chat you completely ruined her confidence &amp; sense of security in you.\n\nYour GF clearly has raging insecurity issues, why is this- did you cheat on her in the past, or is this entirely coming from within her? If so the latter, then trying to adapt your behaviour is not going to fix things (it will simply enable her insecurities further).",

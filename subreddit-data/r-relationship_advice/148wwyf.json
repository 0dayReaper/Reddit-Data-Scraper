    "postText": "So to cut to the chase, my partner is very easily stressed, and I have a stressful life. I am a director in a service industry position so things are constantly going wrong and we've had several discussions about how he doesn't want to hear all that because it just drags him down. For me a lot of time it's just anecdotal, I don't carry a lot of weight with the stories because it happens all the time, I'm just talking about my day. But I get it, what happens at my job doesn't really matter in our life together\n\nThe part that I'm struggling with is that I also can't talk about my family or personal issues. For example my brother is an addict in and out of rehab with a baby daughter who I try to help as much as I can so this is a big part of my life. But I can't bring it up because it stresses him out. I also just found out my dad is seriously dating the woman he cheated on my mom with before she died. I know I can't even broach this topic. And I need to. I have a therapist, I have friends, but nothing replaces your partner in life, that's why they're there. \n\nI know I'm outgoing and I talk a lot and that's my fault and not his, but I feel like I need to be able to talk about this stuff at home. Aita for asking for this after he's made it clear that this sort of discussion makes him uncomfortable?  I really want to get some balanced input before I initiate a discussion with him\n\nThanks",

You shouldn\u2019t have to tiptoe in this respect.

Highly incompatible, if you ask me, especially if one side is unwilling to compromise.",

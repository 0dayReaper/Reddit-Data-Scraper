    "postText": "I am from a SEA country and my first language is not english.\n\nBackstory: I got into an accident after my college and will never be able to have kids. None of my family members know of this. They know about the accident but not about this. I have always wanted to be childfree so it did not affect me much mentally.\n\nI have finished my Masters Degree last year and never dated before. I got a very high paying job directly through campus placements. My parents immediately wanted me to get married after getting a job but I wanted to work on myself and explore a bit. They said no and I said that it was my wish. All my life I did what they wanted and for the first time when I talked against them, they were not happy. This was last year and they gave up after covid started.\n\nSo I picked up some dating apps and went through them but no luck. Then my parents introduced me to a family friends daughter and we clicked kinda. Looking back, I was a fool. She said yes to anything I said and never complained about anything. I felt kinda weird about it. I wanted her to express her interests but she always said she was interested in whatever I do. Well, i did not think much about it.\n\nI said that i wont have kids ever and she surprisingly said ok. I was like damn, she is probably the one as it is very hard to find a partner who is childfree in my country (or atleast i thought), but we were in the initial stages and I have not told about my accident. Long story short, we had sex a month ago, i used condoms because safety first. The next day on, she started ghosting me a bit. I thought it was due to my performance in bed and wanted to give her some space. Then she texted infrequently and only replied OKs and Ks and one line answers. I thought maybe she wanted to end the relation and was sad but left it at that.\n\nYesterday, all her family came to my house and she claims shes pregnant and the father is me. Needless to say, I freaked the fuck out and wanted to collapse on the ground. I did not say anything while they were talking about marriage and stuff that needs to happen because I got her pregnant.\n\nPlease advice me on what steps to take now reddit\n\nUPDATE: Let me start off by saying im very very grateful for all the redditors who took their time to read and give me advice. I was overwhelmed by the amount of comments and how many of you said it might not even be my kid. Looking at it from a different perspective gave me much more insight on the whole situation. I called my boss and took today off.\n\nI called up some clinics to get tested and was given a slot on Friday afternoon. Then I went to the store and bought some pregnancy tests and asked only her to come to my place tomorrow ( i.e today morning). I also called my parents and my before I said anything, my mom asked me if I had any good news, I was shocked by what she said and asked me what exactly she was talking about. She then played dumb and I knew that the situation was more fucked that I thought. I cut the call and cried all night till 3am, grown ass man crying for the first time since 8th class. \n\nShe came today morning with her parents even after I told her to come alone. They were under the impression that I was gonna discuss engagement plans with them. I told them to wait outside and called her in and they threw a fit. I told they can all go back or let her alone come in, they said ok. \n\nI took out the pregnancy tests and gave it to her and told her to prove that she was actually pregnant and told her where the bathroom was. She started screaming at me(never done this before, I was shocked at this), then she went out the door and called her parents in. Now everyone is screaming at me in my own home because I asked her to prove the pregnancy not even a DNA test. I told them all to fuck off and one hour later my parents and they all came to my home and they spilled the beans. She was never actually pregnant(as many redditors said), my parents were afraid that I was getting old for marriage and wanted me to marry and give them grandchildren. They said that in arrange marriages, no need for the people to actually get to know the spouse because parents choose only the best for their kids. They planned this all and were only waiting for me to have sex with her to do this. I broke down and cried again. All my life, I did exactly what my parents wanted, always scored high and never asked for anything. I told them to get out and never talk to me again in between crying and they said parents know whats best for their kids and I should do what they say. Then I got extremely angry and told them to fuck themselves in my native language which was very bad. For once, I think they knew I was serious with them and they all left. I blocked them all before sending my parents a message to never again contact me in my life even if one of you is dying. \n\nCried for some more time, went through some dog videos and went through all my messages on reddit and I feel like I owe you guys this update because it was you guys who helped me do this. That is all and I hope you have a wonderful day.",

Beyond that most sterility is a classification because of probabilities, but it only takes one lucky swimmer to make it through.\n\nThat said, being told OP is sterile and using a condom, the odds are so astronomical that if paternity does prove this is OP's child, then the universe has decided OP's decision to be child free was wrong with a big giant \"NO\" sign to the face.",

Let her know the dr says it's not his.  If she still insists it is, ask her how she wants to handle it until such time there can be a paternity test.  Marriage is straight up off the table, but that doesn't mean he can't be a united front with her until paternity.\n\nSorry, but there are still areas of the world where she could be beaten to death for sleeping around.",

Because it takes a few weeks for your body to even alert you that you\u2019re pregnant unless you\u2019re actively trying. My hunch is, she slept with you, was talking to someone else and had sex with them, but since you two were seeing each other and family friends, it\u2019s easier to pin it on you. You should communicate to your family and hers that you were told you were sterile. I think this will give you breathing room to get a test for yourself, and for her.",

I knew that it would\u2019ve been a horrible decision for so many reasons. I wasn\u2019t ready to get married and I had only been with my sons father for a few months. I ended the relationship and did not marry him despite the pleas of my family and I\u2019m so glad I stuck to my guns and did all that back then!! When u try to force marriage, it generally never works. it also doesn\u2019t help the children involved either. Instead of seeing a positive, co-parenting relationship, they see a bitter forced marriage that will pry be full of fighting and negativity. Resist the urge to give into old-fashioned advice and do what u know is right for u!",

Your parents may have very well known she was pregnant too. She also could have had conversations about the whole plan the night before the two of you had sex. And it did seem very clear that it was a scheme on your parents part so they could have a grandchild.\n\nI have no clue what country you are in but whatever you do, DO NOT ALLOW YOUR NAME ON THAT CHILD'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE. \n\nI would make that very clear. Because if you are listed as the Father, then you could be on the hook finicially taking care of that child. Also, I do believe you when you stated you are sterile but this does happen to men sometimes where they think they are shooting blanks but they still had some sperms in there. And it only takes one to get a women pregnant. So,  there is a possibility that this child is yours. Even if it is a less then a 10% or 1% chance. As some one else said, it certainly isn't zero and you don't have clarification from a doctor at the moment to let your know the odds. In fact, I would recommend doing a check of your sperm count to verify. If you give a sample, there should not be any sperms in there when its checked by a doctor. But get doctor to confirm all this for you and come clean with everyone about your sterility. Also, someone made a comment that you can do a non-invasive paternity test as early as 8 weeks. So by the end of next month I think you can get a paternity test done. Make sure you do both by the way. The doctors visit for your sterility and the paternity test so you know 100% sure either way.\n\nAnd! Please give us an update once you know because I am rooting for you as a fellow child-free person and I am hoping this works out in your favor. The next update I hope to see if your are not the father. Best of luck!",

Think of it like this, if the kid is yours, what would you agree to? you can just go with that and it'll calm everyone down for 8 more weeks, make sure all those \"agreement\" are delayed enough until you can get a test result.\n\n2) The kid is unlikely to be his, but at the same time, no one knows. He can think that he's shooting blanks but it's not 100% of the time unless he's missing all of his balls. If that's the case the doctor can probably prove it lol.

It\u2019s too messy with your parents.\n\nBefore ANYTHING, make sure to get tested with reports of your sterility. \n\nHave that in your back pocket, if they continue to insist, request a paternity test.\n\nBefore anything, you should find out what your or her parents involvement is in this. THEN you can bring up the sterile/paternity test.\n\nGet your answers first",

Also, how does she know she is pregnant? A missed period or urine test might not be so accurate - the gold standard is a blood test. \n\nI understand that if your culture is highly religious or conservative they might take offense to such a \"factual\" way of proving pregnancy &amp; fatherhood but if you are calm, tactful, polite, and explain the circumstances of your accident and that you were so careful to use a condom, the parents might be understanding about why you are confused and skeptical. Again, I think keeping calm and polite &amp; communicating warmly is key - emotions are likely running high for the parents and you can easily be targeted as the bad guy trying to wriggle out of responsibility.\n\n\nSummary: Go to a doctor to prove your sterility. Avoid asking the gf about other partners if conservative or parents are involved as things might get highly emotional. Communicate politely and respectfully and hope they are reasonable people.

Tell her you know the baby isn\u2019t yours and you will tell her family if she doesn\u2019t tell the truth. Try and get the truth out of her. \n\nDo not marry this girl and her family they already sound controlling and manipulative. \n\nIf the results say you could have gotten her pregnant and she is then demand a DNA test when the baby is born.",

            "comment": "There's a fair amount of bad advice in here, so let me see if I can get you started.\n\nThere really is no way to \"guarantee sterility\" unless you've had your testes removed, destroyed in some way, or had the tubes leading from your testes to your prostate severed and sealed.  There is a possibility that you are confusing \"sterile\" with \"infertile\".  That is, you may have had an incident that has lowered your sperm count so radically that you will find it incredibly difficult or almost impossible to conceive.\n\nThat being said, the total number of sperm you need to supply is one.  That's it.  So no matter how low your sperm count is, unless there is a physical reason it is zero, there is always a remote possibility that something occurred.\n\nAt this point, you need to consider three paths:\n\n- She's not pregnant, and is trying some weird maneuver to get married.\n\n- She is pregnant by someone else, and whoever that is won't be acceptable for some reason, so you are the lucky guy that bails her out of this mess.\n\n- She is pregnant by you, and you're now a father.\n\nIn all events, you need to do two things:\n\n1. Cut off all contact with her and her parents.\n\n2. Hire a lawyer, because this can get real messy real fast.",

He destroyed his marriage because he was so confident that he would never have children.

That should buy you time from both sets of parents as well as provide you a lot more answers than Reddit can provide.\n\nFirst thing they do will test to verify if she actually IS pregnant. While it sounds like she was being really sketchy, it is possible that she might just be a little undereducated about her body. You had sex one time a month ago so if you give her the benefit of the doubt she might just be having an irregular period and not actually be pregnant at all. \n\nNext, if she actually is pregnant, they try to pin down the age of the fetus. If the doctors determine it is 2 or more months along, you have your ability to deny the baby without disclosing your health issues to your family or anyone else\u2019s. As both parents set you two up, everyone is aware how short the time frame of conception would logistically be to be your child. \n\nIF she actually is pregnant and the doctor determines the fetus fits into the one month conception time span, then you bring up to the doctor in front of her about your past infertility diagnosis and ask the doctor to do tests on you to see what the possibility is of you fathering children. They should be able to determine if you have the ability or if the previous doctors were correct about your infertility. \n\nIf they determine you potentially can father children, remind the girl about your feelings on children that you discussed before you ever had sex. What, if any, involvement you will be willing to have in the kid\u2019s life. If she decides to keep it, let her know you will expect a paternity test performed.",

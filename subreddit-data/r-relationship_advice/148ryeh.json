    "postText": "So my (23f) short-term boyfriend (24m) doesnt like to do any kind of pda with me, including holding hands outside. I am naturally a pretty insecure person so this was hard at first, but i figured he just wasnt super comfortable with touching. What has bothered me lately is that he doesnt have any issues being sarcastically/playfully touchy with his other guy friends in public or in front of me. Dont get me wrong, i normally would have NO issue with this. But i cant help feeling like hes fine being affectionate in public, just not with me. How do i bring this up without making it sound like an ultimatum?",

            "comment": "If it's a \"dealbreaker\" then it absolutely IS an \"ultimatum\". But ask yourself if you'd truly be happy holding his hand in public knowing the whole time he's cringing from it. Most people don't want forced shows of affection because they know they're not genuine. If this is truly a \"dealbreaker\" for you just end the relationship. No one's going to happily hold your hand when you're holding a gun to their head. You and he just have different notions of what's acceptable while out in public as a couple.",

My partner likes hand holding and PDA, we\u2019ve simply had to make compromises, I try to hold their hand occasionally but they have to be okay with me letting go when I want to, their understanding and not pushing it has made me more likely to choose to hold their hand. \n\nNot everything is personal, we all have different preferences. That being said only you know if this is something you can work on understanding his perspective and compromising. If its a deal breaker for you, you may just be incompatible. Good luck!",

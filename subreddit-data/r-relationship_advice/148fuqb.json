I want to give my baby's a complete family but I think it will worsen my mental health.\n\nFew of our family and friends somehow siding him because it was just a  random one night stand that he was too drunk even to remember. That I should forgive him that it's just a trial of our marriage.",

Trial of your marriage my foot.\n\n&gt;he said thay i'm very inconsiderate to our baby that i'm not allowing her to have a complete family.\n\nHe was inconsiderate to your baby by spending time and effort on another woman, why should you allow him to be only partially in your marriage and only partially a father. If he feels you both only need part of his time and attention you'll be looking other places for the bits he feels best to spend elsewhere.\n\nYou are doing the right thing.",

I'm a child of divorce too, and I am sooo happy my parents separated instead of being miserable together and fighting all the time. OP needs to make her own decision, but from what she's written it sounds to me like the relationship is over. This dude sounds like an asshole, and if she tried to make it work I believe that sooner or later they would break up again, which would be a worse situation for the kid.",

Even though the husband has broken a sacred covenant of the relationship, it\u2019s worth saving if it can be saved if the relationship has otherwise been good. It\u2019s important to have a conversation and see if and how trust can be rebuilt. Of course if it was a pattern it would be a different thing. It is a big blunder but OP should see if their feelings calm down over time and they can rebuild what has been lost. It\u2019s not easy by any means but it\u2019s worth a shot if it\u2019s truly been a one time mistake. Make the husband understand what is at stake, and see how he responds. He has cheated and made a huge blunder but if he does care about you, think if you can work through it. Don\u2019t take any decision without giving yourself enough time to absorb the repercussions. \n\nPS: I am not someone who takes cheating lightly but saying this given your unique situation.",

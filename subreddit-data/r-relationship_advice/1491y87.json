    "postText": "TLDR Lost best friend to her crazy new love interest\r  \n\r  \nI (36M) recently lost my best friend, Elise (36F), when she started dating a new girlfriend (37F). Elise and I have been best friends for 13 years. We workout together, we cycle together, we race triathlon together, and we've done a little bit of traveling together as well. Throughout the 13 years, things have always been platonic between us. Always.\r  \n\r  \nElise and her new girlfriend have known each other about a month and its been a total drama fest the whole way. Recently, the new girlfriend became \"uncomfortable\" about Elise training and cycling with me. It doesn't matter if its one-on-one or with other people. Elise is not allowed to be around me at all.\r  \n\r  \nThe worst part is that Elise instantly folded. We had a tearful and sad conversation about the state of things when she originally told me she can't train or cycle with me anymore. She told me she loved me and that I was like a brother to her. A few days later I called her to try again and rectify the situation and she grew angry and threatened not to answer my phone calls anymore. \r  \n\r  \nThis behavior is very uncharacteristic of Elise. And quite alarming. This is the last thing I thought I would have to deal with at age 36. I'm utterly crushed and feel this ridiculous situation is out of control.\r  \n\r  \nDo I need to keep trying or let this hopefully ride out? Any advice/input would be welcome. Thank you in advance :)",

            "comment": "It is possible that Elise talked about you with her gf in such affectionate terms that she sparked suspicion of a covert relationship (\"How can they have not gone physical if they love each other so much\") or simply jealousy at the intensity of your bond. \n\nWhen you tried to call Elise, you put her in a difficult situation because if you keep trying to keep in touch, she knows at some point she will have to break up with one of you. I think her reaction is understandable.\n\nNow, if you fear for her, you should tell her concisely, make her know you're there and you won't hold grudges, and wait. This way she knows she can ask for your help at her own pace. If you think she is being irrational, wait some time and then go back to her and try to see whether there's margin for her to talk to her gf once their relationship is more stable.",

    "postText": "TL;DR: Is girlfriend staying in contact (occasionally) with and/or not turning down guys who want to date her in DMs something to be concerned about or do I just need to keep working more on my trust issues? She's not really the flirty or dress-upy type in person btw. And I do kind of trust that she would never date these guys?\n\nJust to start I definitely have trust issues due to trauma as a kid, been in therapy and it's better but a work in progress. Still have a hard time trusting others and myself or my thoughts so it may be me.\n\nAnyway, she's my first real girlfriend and I don't know why I'm concerned about cheating since it hasn't happened to me, it's more about the breaking of trust that would hurt and me trying to avoid that pain.\n\nShe cheated (not physically) emotionally and with sexting/nudes at the end of her last relationship of 4 years and we talked about it. I think I'm worried because when we did she made it seem like she had no responsibility in it getting to that point but I decided to let it go. \n\nStill she stays in contact with at least 2-3 guys on/off she met gaming in the same game she cheated and met a few exes. I don't care about her wanting male attention (her words) or even flirting in person but it feels different to be talking to them online (discord/insta/etc) even more than her female friends especially when she voiced herself one guy can be inappropriate with her and annoys her but she still ended up starting to talk to that guy again.\n\nI'm not really worried about her meeting up, it's more the potential for emotional cheating especially because she has a hard time bringing up issues or when her needs aren't getting met. I usually have to bring it up because I'm hypersensitive to people's emotion due to my trauma so I usually read her pretty accurately.\n\nMain concern is that if we're going through a difficult time she'll go fall back on emotional needs and maybe even sexual needs (sexting) since she knows those guys desire her even though she'd never really date them, which I do believe she wouldn't but I think that'd cause us more issues or her getting irritated with me more when I'm not perfect since at least one guy will always treat her better.\n\nThe big thing is that even though it may not be regular contact she does seem to have a pattern where she won't always tell a guy in DMs she's dating me or turn them down and just leave them on delivered/unread.",

Accept it, and know that although she may love you, she'll always be looking in her peripheral vision for physical validation from others\n2. End it, and find someone with whom you don't have to constantly sit around anxiously worrying about physically and emotionally satisfying.",

Leaving guys on \"read\" is fine because far too often turning them down outright results in them raging out at you (sometimes even taking the violence IRL, women have been murdered over this). But if she has a track record of sending nudes and basically acting like an attention starved teenager that's a problem. She likely has no intention of ever meeting up in person with these guys. But when someone is this grasping and still so vulnerable to flattery it means they haven't matured much since middle school.",

    "postText": "Hello Reddit,\n\nI met a girl on a dating app (and yes confirmed she is a real person). We talked for a little while, and anyways we have set up a date this weekend to go out and get drinks and if things are good after that go to mine to watch something we were talking about. And later she mentioned maybe staying over. I'm on board, only issue is that I have no experience. It just hasn't happened for me. I think I come across as a pretty normal guy and I've worked hard to improve myself.\n\nWhat do I do? I want to do this obviously, but now I'm feeling anxious. Should I say anything about it? Should I not mention it and just go ahead with it as this seems to be not a serious thing with her? Should I stay away from this kind of situation? I guess so far my plan was to just go ahead with it without bringing it up and do my best, because I don't really know what else I can do at this point.\n\nTLDR: Girl looking for casual fun, virgin very down but clueless.",

            "comment": "The key is confidence. And the key to seeming confident is. Being honest, not being too eager and being flexible. And not becoming awkward when something doesn't go exactly as planned. You can be honest by saying you're not as experienced. And hope she doesn't ask further questions. If she does then there's no real point in not saying the truth. But then own it. Don't try to deflect or become awkward and nervous. If she is looking for something casual the worst you can do is become over emotional or attached.",

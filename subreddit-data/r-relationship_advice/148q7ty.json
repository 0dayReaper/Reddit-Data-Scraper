    "postText": "Im the 27 year old and I got a call from my daycare and I had to leave work to take my child to the ER. My upper managers understood and let me leave work early to tend to my child. I came back to work the next day and one of my co workers was very passive aggressive towards me. She also talked loudly to our other co workers (other co workers age range is also around 21-28) so I can hear her talk about me. She was saying how she had to do all of my work since I left early and she made snarky comments and said \u201cI wish I got knocked up by some random so I can have excuses to leave in the middle of work\u201d (she said that because I got pregnant by a one night stand and I\u2019m a single mom). Another co worker replied back to her and said \u201cparents are so entitled they think they are so special cuz they can\u2019t keep their legs closed.\u201d And another one said \u201cyeah like no one forced you to bring a kid in this world\u201d. \n\nA lot of my co workers are mad at me because I had to leave work and they had to do my work but they didn\u2019t have to stay longer. Work gets off at 4:30 PM regardless. \n\nI feel bad because the way they are talking about me is hurting my feelings and is making the work environment just toxic, awkward, and uncomfortable. I\u2019m not a confrontational person. Should I just apologize? I\u2019m lost of what I should do and how I should go about this situation",

Not only to begin the process of stopping this workplace bullying, but also to get ahead of this before one of them tries to cause more problems. \n\nI know it's difficult but remember that you did nothing wrong. You didn't choose for your child to have a medical emergency, and even people who don't have kids can be called away from work by family emergencies.",

You don\u2019t have to apologize to anyone for caring for your child, but if you don\u2019t cover for them, it\u2019s not right to have them cover for you. If that\u2019s the case, management needs to come up with a solution so there isn\u2019t an unequal division of labor that only negatively affects specific classes of people. Maybe a discussion needs to be had with management to separate tasks out or redefine roles to ensure that nobody is doing more work than anyone else due to child status or any other protected class. Regardless if that conversation happens, HR needs to be involved, because your coworkers are in the wrong for speaking of you that way and making you feel that way in the workplace. Also\u2026 don\u2019t talk to coworkers about your personal life.",

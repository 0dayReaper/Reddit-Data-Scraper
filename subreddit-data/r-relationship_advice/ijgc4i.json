    "postText": "My brother is 15, my sister is 17, and I'm 23f. This is really stupid and it shouldn't have happened but it did. Now I just want advice on how to make it better. Also this is the story my brother told me as I wasn't there.\n\nHe was in his room playing on his phone minding his own business. He got up to take out the trash. He came back to lay down im his bed. As he was laying down he noticed there dog walking out of his room. He ignored it.\n\nLater on his sister 17 noticed clothes were missing. She went looking for it and found it in my brothers room. The problem was that is was wet and slimy. She immediately told our parents and they thought the worse. My dad, mom, and brother argued about it. \n\nRude things were said. Apparently mom said I knew you were weird but not this weird. My dad said I raised a predator. In the end my parents asked me to pick him up and let him stay with me for a couple of days. When I picked him up he didn't say anything and just sat in silence.\n\nHe spent the entire time in the room he was staying in. He only came out for dinner. He skipped breakfast and lunch. His eye's were always red when he came out so I assume he was crying. I've never seen him cry. Most of the time when he's upset he just has a stone face so what they said must have got to him.\n\nFinally at the end of the week he's parents called me and said they wanted to talk to him so they came over. Before they came over I tried to talk to him but he ignored me. When parents came they apologised to him. Over the week they noticed more of sister clothes in his room until one day my dad caught the dog with my sister clothes.\n\nMy brother just said okay and went home. I tried to ask my parents if he could stay longer but they said that wouldn't be necessary. Later on I got a call asking me what did he do over my house because he's just been in his room all day at there house. Is there anything I can do to help him feel better?\n\nAdvice would be greatly unappreciated.\n\nEdit little update:Good news. He can stay with me until Sunday. I had to lie a little to parents to get him to come. I told them he should get out the house because he spends most of his day sitting in one spot with online school.\n\nThey didn't believe me a first but I said it would be a chance to get him out his room. They finally agreed. He was about to go to sleep so I came just in time. I think the plan right now is to just spent time with him this week. I'm broke so it's gonna be mostly home stuff.\n\nI tried to talk to him on the car ride. I asked him if he's okay. He said he's fine and we had a little conversation about his school. So at least he's talking now. He's in the spare room so everything is okay right now.\n\nFinal update:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/innyw1/updatemy_parents_falsely_accused_my_brother_of/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share",

Another one of his sisters? I don't know your family, but it would seem to me like they have more problems with him than just that. And that's just awful. He's 15. He doesn't deserve any of this abusive crap. I really hope he starts responding to your texts soon. Maybe you could take him out to do some fun things? To show him you know he's not like that? I don't know. It's a really horrible situation.",

I know the betrayal this kid feels. part of the way that my autism impacts me is that I almost never lie and am mentally incapable of understanding the reason that someone might lie in a specific situation without having it explained to me and my mother knows this very clearly so she ignored everything she knew about me to reinforce her deep seeded hatred of me. to put it explicitly, I haven't felt anything but superhuman disdain for her for as long as I can remember. it's unfortunate that this guy is younger than me because he will have to drift through her influence over his life longer than I had to before I was able to become my own person. It's parents like this that make me wish I had a nuke in every city because they are everywhere.",

Yeah, he probably doesn\u2019t have much use for her either right now.\n\nYour brother needs space and time to heal. Being at home and being made to interact with this right now is punishment, even though they are his parents and sister.\n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d tell my parents what they did was inexcusable. I\u2019d talk to him one on one and see if he wanted to stay with you for a few weeks. He\u2019s 15, being accused of creeping on his sister really put a dent in his self-esteem and self-worth. He needs time to heal. I would also tell him you were there for him no matter what. He will eventually seek affirmation that\u2019s he\u2019s not the weirdo he was labeled. Be there for him.\n\nAs for your parents, good grief, they need counseling and your sister probably does too. They made their beds by striking him down so harshly, now they\u2019ll have to deal with it awhile.\n\nIt\u2019s tough being a 15 year old kid without these accusations; he really got put behind the eight ball with this situation!\n\nI hope the beat for him!",

Let them know your worried about him and ask if there was any prior instances that led them to automatically go hard core on him. Your dad should know what being a 15 year old male was like, remind him of this. Remind him about the awkwardness of going through puberty and ask him what he\u2019d have done if accused of the same. Make it damn personal to him; he needs to open his eyes on what he\u2019s done to his son.\n\nRegardless of what they say and possibly mention about any prior occurrences, approach him. Let him know you are there for him. He\u2019s likely feeling like he\u2019s been banished to the basement. Ask him to spend some time with you and if you can, try to get him to do something outside of the house (bowling, swimming, beach, dinner out). Whether or not he says it, he will appreciate the attention. Right now he\u2019s all alone and that\u2019s not healthy. Money doesn\u2019t heal wounds, but I\u2019d hit your parents up for some money to get him out the house; this is their failure, not yours.\n\nThe other sister needs to approach him as well.

I told them he should get out the house because he spends most of his day sitting in one spot with online school.\n\nThey didn't believe me a first but I said it would be a chance to get him out his room. They finally agreed. He was about to go to sleep so I came just in time. I think the plan right now is to just spent time with him this week. I'm broke so it's gonna be mostly home stuff.\n\nI tried to talk to him on the car ride. I asked him if he's okay. He said he's fine and we had a little conversation about his school. So at least he's talking now. He's in the spare room so everything is okay right now.",

A young man at the age of 15 is right at the time where he is developing his self worth and self image, and not only that, a significant amount of that comes from how he is perceived by his parents and family.  \n\nNow his self image has been defined by the words 'weird' and 'predator', and that was where the parents ended up, that was the fall back, and that must have been hugely damaging to your brother.   \n\nThis is now reflected in your brothers behaviour, and the people that he would most expect to support him have clearly demonstrated that the go to is to throw him under the bus.  This is a huge and unwarranted violation of trust, and then to reinforce that by sending him out of his house and his space?  This must have been hugely damaging to your poor brother.\n\nYour first stop is not your brother, it's your parents.   Someone needs to sit down with them and put some context around their actions, and just how devastating it must have been for your brother, and to hear those accusations levelled against him at a time where he is still trying to define who and what he is as a man.  It needs to be told to them in no uncertain terms that they have let their son down in the worst possible way, at the worst possible time! \n\nOnce that has been acknowledged, then they have to start working to repair the damage, and this needs to happen as soon as possible, because your brother's brain is currently in the process of hard wiring his self image.   \n\nTell your parents to get some counselling as well, their head-space sounds a bit off too!\n\nYou're a great big sister by the way!",

An apology usually works for instanced actions. What do I mean by that? I mean things like: Maybe he\u2019s playing video games and his sisters being annoying and he gets really mad and calls her a bitch. Or, his parents wrongfully blame him for the shirt and they say \u201cWhy was the shirt in your room you fucking sicko?!\u201d These are things that can be apologized for and more readily accepted because you can rationalize that they wouldn\u2019t have said that had they not been irrationally upset in the moment/instance. \n\nProblem is, your parents revealed that they\u2019ve felt this way for awhile if not a long long time. It\u2019d be like if your brother said \u201cI\u2019ve always thought you were a fucking bitch\u201d, rather than \u201cquit being a fucking bitch\u201d (per my earlier hypothetical). See the difference? You should try to explain this to your parents so that they understand why even though they apologized, your brother is still rightfully upset.",

You have to understand, words can't be unsaid or taken back.\n\nIf you strike a person on the cheek, break a bone even, or slice his arm; even near death experiences people can heal from. Even if they're injured for life, the pain of what they endured will never be as great as when it first happened.\n\nHowever, words are unique. Words are energy that affects matter, not just physical matter. Words get in deeper than any knife or fist. It's like a shard of glass, trapped in one's heart &amp; mind, a wound that constantly reopens every time he replays those words over &amp; over again in his head.\n\nIt's like a knife that keeps twisting in his side; he gets no rest. **I know that pain.** We all do. Many commit suicide to end the pain, from children to adults. \n\nI'd watch him carefully, &amp; **speak words of life, positivity &amp; encouragement into his heart!** Tell your parents to do the same. \n\nThis is the best that can be done, aside from them apologizing **from the heart, a sincere apology,** &amp; perhaps a therapist, counsellor or someone he can talk to about his feelings.\n\nBut the damage is done; no undoing that. Period. It can't be understated. Let his parents understand this, &amp; learn to not jump to conclusions &amp; assassinate someone's character with their thoughtless, emotion driven words. That stuff is like poison &amp; rot in one's bones!",

Nearly unforgivable. They violated his sense of safety, home, and love. They thought so little of this young, impressionable boy that they jumped to believing he was a sexual predator preying on his own sibling. Their reaction will likely damage him for the rest of his life. Not to mention destroy their relationship with him.",

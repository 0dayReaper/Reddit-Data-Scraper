    "postText": "i recently started dating my boyfriend who i met earlier this year. we were friends for a few months first, and after talking often i began to have feelings for him. i kind of felt that it was mutual, he would often say things that were pretty flirty and hinted at being more than friends. a few weeks before we started dating, he found out his ex girlfriend had passed away. it\u2019s a long story, but they had never broken up; they were in an LDR last year and she had suddenly stopped contacting him and he hadn\u2019t known why until he found out it was because she passed away :( when he shared this with me, i did my best to listen to anything he needed to say, so at the time most of our conversations were about her and his memories with her which was understandable as he was grieving extremely sudden news and i wanted to be there for him. \n\nmaybe a week or two later, he went back to acting like he had in the past but i could still tell that he was hurting even though he didn\u2019t bring it up as often. one day we got on the topic of our relationship and i told him i thought it would be a good idea to distance myself because i knew he still needed time to process before getting into another relationship, and i knew it would only be harder for me if i started liking him more and more. this was when he said that he liked me too and didn\u2019t want to regret \u201cletting me go\u201d, so we started dating. i can\u2019t help but feel like i unintentionally rushed him into making that decision. i had not meant to be manipulative at all, i was honestly just trying to protect myself because unrequited love is something i wouldn\u2019t wish on anyone LMAO. \n\nafter we started dating he\u2019s been really sweet but sometimes i can\u2019t help but think that i was a rebound, as horrible as it sounds. these days he brings her up fairly often or becomes sad when we talk about things that remind him of her, which i know i can\u2019t blame him for - and i really don\u2019t, i can\u2019t even imagine how it would feel to lose someone like that. from what he\u2019s told me she seemed like a wonderful person in every way and while i feel bad for thinking this, there\u2019s a part of me that knows i can\u2019t ever compare to her. he still looks back at their old texts and photos of her as well, although lately he said he\u2019s trying not to because it makes him  sad. while i haven\u2019t mentioned all of this to him specifically, i did tell him at first that i thought he needed more time to process, to which he agreed but said that he does like me a lot and is grateful for me even though it might not yet be love. \n\nbefore writing this post i read a lot about peoples\u2019 similar experiences online, and the last thing i want to do is make him feel like he has to move on or forget about her because i\u2019m aware that\u2019s not how grief works. i really care for him, but i feel like my only options are to stay with him and continue feeling this way (which i know is my own problem) or break up with him, which might make him feel even worse and more alone. at this point i definitely don\u2019t think we can just be friends so it would end up being one of the extremes. from an outsider\u2019s perspective, am i just being a jerk for feeling this way?\n\ntldr my boyfriend still loves his ex girlfriend and  i don\u2019t know what i should do about it",

Explain that you need to take a break from your relationship to allow him time to grieve and prepare himself for the next chapter of his life.  When he is ready to move on then you hope to see him again.\n\nThen take the break.  You each need to focus on what matters to yourselves.",

She literally ghosted him and he must have felt hurt and resentment towards her \u201cdisappearance\u201d and now realizing that she didn\u2019t respond because she\u2019s dead must have hit him hard. \n\nMan never got closure\u2026 which is the worst when it comes to grief. Suggest if he visit her grave to say his goodbye. \n\nPart of the grief process is talking about the deceased\u2026usually with close mutual friends to share the experience with. Can he reach out to her family? \n\nIs he seeing a grief therapist? If he isn\u2019t, he really should to work out his emotions.\n\nAs for you, hun, do what is best for you and if that\u2019s stepping back from him, do it. You\u2019re not his therapist. When he\u2019s ready, you can see if the two of you can get back together.",

I will always love her and she will always have a special place in my heart.\n\nI later met a wonderful woman and we got married.  She understands this, we go to the cemetery together in remembrance of her.\n\nI hope this helps you to feel better about your situation and gives you some insight into this",

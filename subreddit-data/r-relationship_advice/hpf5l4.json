    "postText": "This is kind of a complicated story but I\u2019ll just get into it. I used to be in this controlling, kind of abusive relationship. When I finally broke it off a year ago, my ex started showing up places, trying to get me to take him back. Eventually, it developed into full-on stalking. He would show up at my work (and took to just waiting outside of it after he was banned), leave notes on my car when I was at the grocery store, leave all kinds of flowers outside my house and then stick angry notes on my door after he saw me throw them in the trash, wrote me all kinds of weird, obsessive emails and letters. I\u2019ve had to change my phone number three times. The behavior escalated over time, and got scarier/more threatening. In one instance, he started a small fire in my driveway but the police couldn\u2019t get enough evidence connecting him to it. It was after that instance that I put cameras in my yard (I previously only had them pointing at my doors).\n\nI was horrified to learn that the police couldn\u2019t do shit about any of this until my stalker actually was caught doing something illegal, like breaking into my house. At which point, I might already be dead. I decided I wasn\u2019t spending the rest of my life waiting for the other shoe to drop, so I got a handgun and a concealed carry permit, took some self defense courses, and started doing strength training. I also looked into getting an attack dog, but after all the money I\u2019d sunk into my other methods of protection, they were prohibitively expensive. So I went to my local animal shelter and got the scariest, meanest-looking dog I could find. This is where Thor comes in. He\u2019s a 100 pound American Bulldog, looks like he\u2019d rip your throat out on sight, but is basically a gigantic teddy bear. He loves every person he\u2019s ever met, is incredibly sweet and gentle with my 4-year-old niece, enjoys other animals, and even loves the mailman. I just kind of accepted that he probably wouldn\u2019t do anything to protect me from my stalker, but it didn\u2019t matter that much because having such a huge dog made me so much more confident. I brought Thor everywhere I could, and was working on getting him trained enough to be an emotional support animal, so I could bring him inside places with me (I absolutely would not do this until he was trained well enough to not disrupt a regular service dog).\n\nLast month, I woke up in the middle of the night to Thor whining. I was groggy and thought he had to go to the bathroom, so I got out of bed and opened the door. At that point, my house alarm went off and pretty soon after that, I was face-to-face with my stalker. I started screaming and went to run for my gun. Before I could do anything though, Thor ran across the room in full attack mode. The memory is really blurry for me, but there was blood all over my living room and I remember my stalker was eventually able to escape, at which point Thor chased him outside and then came back to me.\n\nWhen the police showed up, they said Thor was a hero who\u2019d probably saved my life. I don\u2019t want to list what they found in my stalker\u2019s car after they caught him (and I\u2019m shaking a little as I type this) but I\u2019m sure he was going to bring me somewhere and kill me. It looks like he\u2019s going to prison for a long time though, so my nightmare is over. Pretty much everyone in my life thinks Thor is a hero, except my SIL. She and my brother have a 4 y/o (the one I mentioned above), and she says she doesn\u2019t want Thor around her (the child) anymore. She says since Thor has \u201csnapped\u201d in the past, he could do it again, so he\u2019s not safe to have around kids (We used to see each other a few times a week before she decided Thor was dangerous). The way she words this makes me *really angry* because Thor didn\u2019t \u201csnap\u201d. He saw a stranger break into his home, heard his owner scream in terror, and reacted to defend me, himself, and his house. Nothing about that screams \u201cdangerous around children\u201d to me, unless my niece is also going to break into my house and threaten me.\n\nThis is also a very emotional issue for me because Thor isn\u2019t just a dog to me. He\u2019s my safe place, my hero, the one who protected me and kept me safe when no one else could. I\u2019ve also gotten increasingly anxious since this happened, and I can\u2019t go anywhere without Thor. I barely leave my house, pay to pick up my groceries from the store instead of going in because I know Thor isn\u2019t allowed inside, and all my friends know that if Thor isn\u2019t welcome in their house, I\u2019m not coming either (although they\u2019re perfectly welcome to come hang out at my house instead). I am really going through it, and am working with a therapist to overcome this (luckily my office is still fully remote but I need to be able to go back to work once we\u2019re in person again). But I really really need my brother and SIL\u2019s support. I think my SIL thinks I\u2019m just pouting and that\u2019s why I won\u2019t just leave the dog home and come over without him. I don\u2019t know how to explain to them that the fear hasn\u2019t stopped just because my stalker is in jail. It\u2019s actually a lot worse than it was before. I\u2019ve already suggested they come over and I crate Thor, but that wasn\u2019t good enough for her. What can I do to make her understand the situation better?\n\ntl;dr My dog took down my stalker after he broke into my house. Now I have severe anxiety and am too afraid to be without him, but my SIL thinks he\u2019s unsafe around my 4 y/o niece. I don\u2019t know how to make them understand that I really am too afraid to go anywhere without him and not just trying to win an argument.",

            "comment": "Most of the people that replied have given you excellent advice. Mine is to get you to see that you won.\n\nAs  I read your post, I realized that you have no idea how smart and strong you are. You were threatened and took action. You got a gun, permit, training, cameras, alarm system, a dog and all the things that I usually have to talk people into. For years I provided a service to victims of stalkers. I would first inform them of their legal rights, tell them their options, help them with filing reports, do a deep background on the stalker, inspect the home for security, advise then on a proper alarm system and changes, find a contractor, help them select a handgun and training, train them what to do at home, at work, on the street, help find a dog, therapist and many other things. Over the years, I developed a thorough understanding of the mind of  stalkers and how to deal with them. I know how helpless you feel when the law says you have to be beaten or killed before they can do anything. Today, most major cities have a support group for people that  are harassed by stalkers. Sometimes, I would even have a \u201cdiscussion \u201c with the stalker, but that only worked 10% of the time. Stalkers know the law, aren\u2019t afraid of much and are driven by things most people don\u2019t understand. I could list the many things we did, including staking out the house and catching them. I was licensed and permitted in everything. I only share this background so that you know that I have more experience at this that most people. The reason I\u2019m replying to your post is to tell you that you did things on your own, that I had to push clients to do, because they either were paralyzed with fear, lived in denial or were passive and had to be pushed into protecting themselves. Some even wanted to move away. Never run from a stalker and you didn\u2019t. In 15 years I never  had one client that took the initiative like you have. You did almost everything right and you should be proud of your efforts and know that you are strong enough to deal with this and anything else life throws at you, You won! Don\u2019t let this piece of trash know that he caused you pain. These sick people get pleasure from your fear. So as you go forward, don\u2019t let your SIL get to you. She has no idea what you went through and her fear of your dog is baseless. You are really lucky and have one heck of a dog. He saved you life and deserves a great partner like you. Please don\u2019t underestimate yourself. I never had one client as strong and smart as you. You should be talking to victims and sharing your story of courage and survival. You would provide a service to victims that think no one understands their constant fear. If you did that, you would be giving yourself therapy. Therapy isn\u2019t much more than sharing your fears with someone that understands and you truly do.",

Do they have a victim advocate\u2019s office? If not, I recommend looking up the national Association of Crime Victims Compensation Boards (if in US) Link: http://www.nacvcb.org/\nThey can help you figure out what you are eligible for as a victim. \nI can tell you from experience as a victim of a crime that this service has been invaluable and us allowed me to receive free weekly trauma therapy for almost a year now. (Virtual since COVID). \nIt also might help you find ways to talk to your brother and SIL. Your support system is more important than ever, but sometimes people truly don\u2019t understand the brain alteration a trauma can cause and you might not have the ability to describe it in a way they can understand right now. A therapist can help coach you on how to talk to them so that you can hopefully have time with your family and niece, and your dog. \n\nAlso- and I hate to add this depressing advice, but talk to the victim advocate or sign up for the victim notification via the prison system so you aren\u2019t taken unawares by an early sentencing release. In the case I\u2019m a victim in, the perp was sentenced to 6 years but will probably be out in less than 3. \nRestraining orders do not always rollover from before, so make sure you have a new one set in place if/when this sociopath gets out on parole. \n\n\nSo thankful Thor was there to keep you alive. Best wishes on healing.",

She is also an animal trainer and vet tech. \n\nOver the years I learned that if a dog shows any signs of reactivity, no matter how hard it may be, to take the dog to a *positive* clicker trainer who specializes in aggression issues - particularly if you intend to keep the dog around someone fragile. It will be better for you in the long run; despite the extra work. It will help prevent any future injuries or lawsuits. Some online resources would be to google Karen Pryor. \n\n/// also never leave the dog alone with a kid or any other animal. Learn dog language like the back of your hand. Never let anyone lay on the dog either. \n\nGood luck to you.",

The closest thing is in my Code of Ethics there's a spot on ensuring competency.  Example, I'm not trained in eating disorders specifically.  If somebody came to me with one, it would be grossly irresponsible of me to try and treat that, specifically because I'm not competent in treating eating disorders.\n\nHowever, I've seen a *lot* of therapists' websites and other webpages have \"specialty lists\" that are a mile long.  Sure, it's possible they've spent years getting the training to be certified in everything under the sun, but my experience with those types of therapists is that they did a CEU one time a year ago and haven't worked with, or trained in, that topic since.\n\nTLDR we should, some do, some done.\n\nPS, regarding the comment about your ex, you're right.  Same as doctors who smoke, lots of therapists have trauma histories and issues, too.",

I\u2019m not recommending it because Thor did anything wrong, but it might make the other person feel more comfortable. It\u2019s a muzzle that can be worn comfortably. Your pup can open it\u2019s mouth, have his tongue hang out, whatever. I got one when introducing my 100lb dog to a 2lb kitten. It\u2019s a safety blanket. You can have them together without any fear. That said, it hurts to get hit with the cage. My lovely dumb dog got excited while wearing it, tried to lick me, and ran into my face with it on. 0/10.\n\nI wish you luck with everything.\n\nEdit: Thank you to whoever awarded me the silver. That was really kind of you. \n\nI had a large aggressive breed dog that was super friendly and loving. He crossed over the rainbow bridge last year. I understand the struggle of having an intimidating dog and the judgements that can go along with it. I especially want aggressive breeds to get all the love and attention they deserve. OP sounds like they\u2019re doing a fantastic job. No one should have to pick between a person/partner wanting what is best for their child or their amazing dog (especially one that saved their life).",

But if a kid pulls it over on themselves it's going to be tragic.\n\nI look at a dog which is capable of sending a full grown man to the hospital to be as dangerous as that pot of spaghetti.  A few ounces of prevention and inconvenience is absolutely worth everyone's piece of mind.\n\nYou can even get the dog to love the box muzzle too.  Make it so that he gets to play a treat game when he puts it on and before long that dog will literally be bringing the muzzle to you whenever he hears the brother's car pull up.",

Obviously he is a sensitive beast of a teddy bear who not only protects his Momma, but would probably do the same for the niece as well. \n\nMy only constructive comment would be perhaps to somehow increase the interactions (indirectly ofc initially) between the SIL and Thor. Hopefully she will understand this isn't a threat to her child, but rather a lovable protector.",

                            "comment": "Frankly, it's irrelevant. Parents have the ultimate decisioning powers relating to how to manage animal-related risks to their children. How truely accurate that assessment is completely besides the point.\n\nAnd, while I agree that Thor is the goodest boy, I've also personally witnessed other undisputibly good dogs incorrectly miscalculate and bite. While I agree it's unlikely in any realistic scenario, it's not IMPOSSIBLE, and parents ultimately have the responsibility to determine how they will mitigate that risk.\n\nAnd, I can't stress enough how good of a boy Thor is. That being said, we're talking a lot about how this experience affected OP. How did it affect Thor, the true subject of dispute? We know he made the contextually correct choice and applied righteous violence. He is a hero.\n\nAnd, now he has as a result been showered with praise and affection. Correctly so, he deserves it. He is a good boy.\n\nBut he is a dog, and frankly the context we have isn't available for his comprehension. He doesn't know the concept of stalker. He knows \"loud noise\" \"owner fear\" \"man\" \"bite\" = love. Is it possible \"noise\" and \"owner startled\" \"bite\" = love, too?\n\nHow this particular animal (Like all animals including you and I) will respond to future stimuli will now be different as a result of this. In exactly what way, we simply don't know. There is NO JUDGEMENT in this, only a legitimate open question.\n\nI think we're making the mistake of confusing realistic uncertainty with a value judgement on the actions. I'm glad Thor did what he did. I hope he wouldn't hesitate to do it again. That doesn't go away when someone says that they're unsure how to evaluate who the dog will react in future situations  knowing that violence is demonstrably on the table.\n\nEdit: not that I see this as particularly relevant, but part of what I'm basing this off of is my time volunteering with \"unadoptable\" dogs as the humane society. Seeing the impacts of trauma on a dog, and the effort that is required to help realign their understanding of the world... it can be a lot. Don't underestimate how a single event like this can change a dog. The rationale they apply to situations can be discovered, and there is NOT as much nuance to it as one might think.",

I don\u2019t think having your dog around children is a good idea at the moment.

He\u2019s in hyper vigilance mode right now and while that\u2019s not to be mistaken for \u201csnapping\u201d, he\u2019s trying to protect you. Let\u2019s say you bring him to a family gathering and someone mistakenly approaches you from behind and grabs your shoulder for an embrace. You have a flashback of that night and you scream. Your dog will 100% defend you exactly as he did before. The problem isn\u2019t with your dog right now, it\u2019s you. It\u2019s not realistic to be able to take him everywhere around people right now because you are massively on edge and he doesn\u2019t have the ability to determine threat from innocent mistake. You need help. Dog and SIL are other problems.",

Your dog's part of your family now and people have to understand that dogs are family.\n\nOn the other hand as a parent it would take some time to let my 4yo near a dog that bit someone. I wouldn't leave a 4yo alone around any dog. Young kids pull tails, pull ears, and do things that dogs respond to.  A 100lb dog with a 4yo is not a good match. \n\nI have a little experience with this. My MIL has a normally sweet but very effective guard dog when somebody it doesn't know comes near. We pulled into her driveway with our young kids in the car and the dog attacked the car. He wouldn't let us out and we had to drive away.  It took 10 years before my wife trusted that dog. \n\nIn your shoes I would acknowledge their fears of the dog around their kids and let them know you understand their feelings, and then hopefully they will understand yours. I would also get some help, it's possible you have some PTSD going on.",

Thor also heard the intruder long before the alarm sounded and would have already been tense.  These animals have incredible hearing.  \n\nThor was hearing some very abnormal sounds that night, followed by an alarm (abnormal to his environment).  He could sense OP's fear (abnormal) and he was long aware of the approaching intruder (abnormal).  Of course he attacked.  There were so many abnormal things occuring in his environment all at the same time.  I highly doubt all these abnormal things occur when Thor is with the child.  Thor is a good boi but he needs time to heal, emotionally, as well.  \n\nIntroduce the child back into the environment, slowly and always supervise.",

Our Dalmation hated every other dog she ever saw but she instantly accepted this pitbull. \n\nAbout 3 years after we had him we were talking around in our mobile home park and a dog from about 5 homes down from where we were had puppies and for some reason despite us never going that way (was a dead end)  suddenly decided my brother was a threat and came running at him in what you could tell was aggression. The Dalmation paniced back towards our house like a coward. My brother just barley got grabbed in the leg before our pitbull got to him from being with my mom on the other side of the house.\n\nSadly the other dog didnt make it. It was a border collie mutt about half the size of \"puppy\" (was the only thing he ever reconised as his name while we had him)\n\nEven worse was pitbull aggression laws said he had to be put down. So 2 dogs were lost that day. Even knowing what I know how I would of trusted that dog to guard my brother after that. He had been used for fighting. Never showed a second of aggression the whole time we had him even when little dogs would run at him barking. He did not care. Never even really barked. Was just the Happiest Boy covered in scars until the day he was put down for defending his human.\n\nNow different then this would be someone elses kid a little bit only because like you said Kids that young cant be trusted alone with a dog period and people do not understand this. Hell most adults do not understand how to saftly get a dog to come to you/approach it other then to run up like a kid yelling DOG.",

That being said, I can understand any parent not wanting their child around dogs largely because, in my experience as a pet owner now, kids don't always realize when they are about to push a dog's limits, ie pulling at its tail, grabbing fur, trying to touch it's face without warning, patting versus slapping. And if the dog has a demonstrated history of being capable of violence--which 1) all animals including humans are, 2) in this case, totally justified!--I can understand her reservations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat all being said, I also don't understand why the crate option or you keeping him on a leash in the presence of the neice isn't sufficient, especially since Thor and your niece have had good interactions in the past. I agree with some other posts that she either just doesn't \"get\" dogs, or was already worried about Thor but didn't have a concrete reason until now to act on her fears. I agree with this comment that, coming from a place of understanding and some sort of compromise might be more achievable.

Dogs are profoundly socially intelligent, and strongly pack/family oriented animals. I will say based on the information given here, your dog was fully cognizant of what he was doing. If this was his first bite, and he has not had any out of norm behavioral events since then, I would say it's definitely not a new habit forming, and was an isolated defensive incident.\n\nAll this is to say, I have a likely solution. First, ask her if she would feel better if your dog received a professional evaluation. If she agrees, call around to local dog trainers and see if anybody will do one. It's usually free or at worst $10-20 and can be done in about 10-20 minutes. Let the trainer know the details of the event and they'll likely be happy to help. I'd recommend a dedicated training facility, but in a pinch PetSmart or PetCo may have somebody on staff that can help.\n\nOh, and give Thor a big kiss on the noggin for me.

Basically, she was fostering (and eventually adopted, I believe) a dog who was really sweet. She had a 3/4-y/o niece who would annoy the crap out of the dog though...the OP tried to talk to her brother and niece about leaving the dog alone but the brother and SIL  just got mad at OP and ignored the situation. Eventually, the niece did something (pulled the dog\u2019s hair?) and the dog let out a growl as a warning to leave him alone. After that, the brother threw a huge tantrum and went off on OP and insisted the dog be put down. The family (including the SIL) took OP\u2019s side, but the brother refused to go anywhere with OP until the dog was put down. That\u2019s where the advice part came in. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t posted too long ago, but it\u2019s what I thought of immediately when I read this. To be fair, my family has also had issues with my 4-y/o cousin and my uncle\u2019s dog. It makes me think that the age is just that sweet spot where they\u2019re a pain in the ass to dogs if their parents don\u2019t intervene.\n\nEdit: Found it.

You bringing a poorly trained pet into a store puts the lives of thoose of us with service animals at risk. \n\nAs well as potentialy putting the service dogs at risk as you did not spend years when your dog was young to ensure that he would be comfortable in an environment like a store. A stressed out and over stimulated dog is not a dog you have fully under your control and he could easily end up trying to go after a service dog. Which, if it happens you'll not only need to pay for ALL of the vet bills of the service dog, but you could be held liable to pay for further damages caused by the handler not being able to function normally while the dog recovers. \n\nThis is an extremely serious matter and you just saying you wouldn't let him disturb real service dogs is not acceptable. Additionally, in many states it is illegal to fake a service dog which you would be doing if you knowingly bring a pet into any store that is explicitly marked as no pets.",

Service dogs are professionally trained to handle many public situations while ESAs have little to no training, most training being the basic sit, stay, come, lay down, and are potty trained.  It seems like Thor could have the mindset of a service animal so I would recommend looking into a professional trainer in your area.\n\nAnyways, Thor sounds amazing.  I\u2019m so glad he was rescued by such a loving owner and I\u2019m glad he was able to protect you.  Dogs are amazing and lifesavers even in the little acts they do.",

I have assisted in in protection training and at the end of the day DOGS DO NOT MAKE GREAT JUDGEMENT CALLS they should not be trusted to do so. A safe dog will not attack anything unless being beaten himself or attacked himself and it will be his last resort. Protection dog are trained with lots of obedience before even being so they are under control when given. They will only do it on command and there is a OUT command. I would do the same thing if I were your sister.",

The SIL needs to understand that you\u2019re still traumatised and be more understanding that you need Thor for your own personal well-being and self-care. But on the other hand, you need to understand that she sees her own daughter as her most precious person and needs to protect her. I understand the niece has already met Thor and is well liked by Thor and vice versa but no matter how docile a dog is and how calm it is, it\u2019s impossible to predict how he would react if your niece did something unpredictable that could also set off the dog. Given that you got the dog from a shelter, it is really hard to know the history of Thor and if he has triggers. I think it is important to talk to your therapist about this and see if she/he might be able to find a way that you can come to a compromise with your SIL. Perhaps you can also find someone who can talk to her about dogs as well as it seems she is not an animal person based on her word choice to describe Thor\u2019s response and just needs more education around dogs and their general behaviour.",

Thor being an ESA (emotional support animal) will not make it so you can take him everywhere. ESAs are untrained pets to provide emotional support. They are for where you live and planes. That is it. \n\nA service dog would be able to go everywhere with you. They are highly trained (2+ years) and you have to be legally disabled to have one. Also, dogs with bite histories are usually excluded from being allowed to be one. \n\nI know this sucks to hear but I would hate for you to get scammed by those online registries and then get in trouble with the law.

If, only if Thor were to attack your 4 years old niece or nephew, the kid won\u2019t stand any chance of surviving the attack. Hence, not taking any chance would be the best bet here. You don\u2019t have kids yet, hence your motherly instinct hasn\u2019t kicked in yet, hopefully some day you\u2019ll understand your SIL.\n5.

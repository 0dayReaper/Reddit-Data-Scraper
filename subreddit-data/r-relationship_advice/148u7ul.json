    "postText": "My mother was sexually assaulted at 13. This resulted in her getting pregnant with my eldest half-brother. **Let's call the abuser (John)**. \n\nMy mother wants **nothing** to do with John. She never has. John took her son from her when she was very young and told her son many lies about her. He also used him to get checks from the state. Eventually, my half-brother grew up and had two daughters. He's been in jail for 10+ years, allegedly murdering one of them. \n\nYet, my mother has never been able to meet her grandchild. 3rd parties always gave false hope, like my niece's mom, for example. They've been posting coming out to California for the past years and never called to visit or anything.\n\n For years my mom has told me, \u201cHopefully, when she grows up, she\u2019ll reach out and meet me.\u201d \n\nThe time came, and John contacted my mom, saying, \u201cYour granddaughter wants to meet you.\u201d When I heard him say that, I was skeptical because why on earth was he calling? And I had a gut feeling he was trying to see my mom, and sure enough. He called back again a few days later, making it seem like he was trying to bring them together for a gathering.  In the previous call, he said she all wanted to meet her. He tried to be sneaky. And this situation triggered me. \n\nI'm protective of my mom, and I wanted to cuss him out over the phone, no lie. I don't want to see him irl either because I\u2019d go to jail fr on behalf of my mom.  I should tell my niece the truth. Because whenever they do meet, we don\u2019t want John to be there. \n\nTD; LR: I'm unsure if I should tell my niece the truth about her grandpa. Because we don't speak as it is, but it seems like she might want to meet my mom for the first time. And how should I even approach this.",

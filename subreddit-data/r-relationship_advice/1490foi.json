    "postText": "Important detail to note: I am a POC and my boyfriend is white.\n\nLong story short, I was dating a white guy (now 20m) a while back and it was long distance. He couldn't do the long distance anymore, okay whatever, we break up with him telling me he's not happy anymore. I'm absolutely crushed. A couple weeks later I'm getting messages from friends saying he's posting photos and videos of him with some other girl (20f). Ouch. It's a white girl. Double ouch. This was all about a year ago.\n\nFlash forward to now, he is engaged to that same girl. When I found out about it, it felt like a serious gut punch, and I couldn't figure out why I was taking it as hard as I was.\n\nI had kind of an inferiority complex when I was younger (5+ years ago) and I considered myself to be less valuable than my white counterparts. I genuinely believed that all the white people willingly in my life were there because it was \"easier\" to get a brown person to like them so they befriended me or dated me because they wouldn't have had to try as hard to be gratified. With age I grew to have more love for myself and began seeing myself as more of an equal to the people around me.\n\nAnyhow, the family of this ex was overall good to me and treated me with kindness. Except for his mom-- while she was never outright mean or cruel to me, she would often ignore my presence in any room that she and I were in together and I felt more tolerated than welcomed by her. I knew his family had more conservative values (mild to severe racism thrown in there b/c his caucasian dad allegedly used the n-word to describe their black neighbors) but for the most part it wasn't an issue while we were together.\n\nOnce I'd had some time to process the break up, my Sad Brain started to entertain the idea that his mother just didn't like me because I'm brown. In a way I get it; you want the best for your kids and might want them to date someone from a background similar to theirs. When I think about it like that, it's more digestible and less painful than seeing it thru the lens that sums it up to say \"they didn't like you because of where your parents were born and the subsequent color of your skin.\" I'd had another (white) ex in high school whose dad I'd once overheard say \"why can't you just date a white girl for once?\" when I was peaking in my race-based inferiority complex, which kinda broke me at the tender age of 15.\n\nI think that seeing my ex who I'd been with for a significant amount of time (1 yr 8 mos is a long time for 19 year-olds ok?) get engaged to a Fellow White he met less than a month after breaking up with me, Token Brown Girl, triggered whatever latent version of my inferiority complex existed after high school.\n\nMy lovely, wonderful, beautiful boyfriend will soon be starting grad school in the Netherlands. The same Netherlands known for its tall, slim, and conventionally attractive women. I trust this man with everything in me; I don't have any suspicion that he'll cheat on me the first chance he gets, but this insecurity that I will simply Never Be Enough because I don't fit the same racial demographic as him is eating away at every thread of confidence I could possibly have and I can't ignore it. I feel like he too will realize that a Fellow White will be a better fit for him after all.  Which sucks because that is something I couldn't change about myself if I wanted to (not to say u should ever change urself to be loved, but insecurities aren't rational and yada yada).\n\nLong distance is hard enough without comparing myself to the Most Perfect Version of women I'll never meet or see. Is this worth bringing up to my bf bc what is he gonna do?\n\nIdk im tired and sad and so sick of feeling like I'm not enough (no one is antagonizing me I'm just insecure and silly).\n\nAny advice would be so appreciated. Thank you for reading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: tldr-  brown girl with inferiority complex fears said complex will ruin her relationship w white bf",

            "comment": "So the main thing I\u2019m taking away from this is your lack of confidence. You will not find a man who will love you for you until you bring that confidence up. You will continually run after the guys who aren\u2019t for you or you continue to push away guys who may before you because you\u2019re not confident in yourself. You should sit down and pay attention to why you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re beautiful. And it\u2019s more than just those guys are going for other women, it\u2019s something deeper than that. I think once you identify that then you can start working on how you can overcome those issues with yourself so that you can be more confident in attract who you really want and who is good for you.",

    "postText": "Link to my first post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ieage6/my_40m_ex_wife_40f_wants_me_to_be_with_her_in_her/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\nQuick recap: My ex wife, who Ive known since I was 10, cheated on me but is now dying and wants me to be around before she dies.\n\nIt's been almost 3 weeks since I've posted and a lot has happened since. I got some solid advice from a lot of you guys, especially some who messaged me their personal experiences. I'd like to thank you guys from the bottom of my heart. \n\nSo here's what happened... \n\nAs many of you guys suggested, I talked to my wife. We had a long discussion about the whole situation and I assured her that no matter what, she is and always will be my first priority. I also assured her that while I wanted to say my good-bye, I would never act like her husband. It would be more like me seeing a childhood friend or something like that. I also told her I would never spend the night nor would I be alone with her. \n\nShe was more comfortable after our talk and was pretty ok with the idea of me seeing my ex again. As you guys guessed, she really felt like she was forced into being ok with it when my sister asked but this time, she really was ok. \n\nSo I talked to my sister and after a long, long heated discussion about what my \"role\" would be in the visit, she agreed to the boundaries my wife and I set. \n\nA week later my sister and I came over to our old marital home. It was surreal cause while the emotions from years before came back to me, I didn't feel any sadness nor hatred or anything negative. I saw my ex, who was waiting for us in the living room and she cried when I walked in. Most of you suggested she was faking it but while she was still strong, you could tell almost immediately something was wrong with her. I indulged her with a hug and we talked for a few hours while my sister made lunch. I showed her pictures of my kids and told her stories about what they're like. Honestly, I didn't know how I would react after I saw her again but it just feels like seeing an old friend you haven't seen in a long time. There was no hate or anything like that. \n\nI walked around the house and it was pretty much the way it was when I left over a decade ago. Im not really sure how I feel about our wedding photos still framed and pictures of us still all over the house but it wasn't really my place to say anything. \n\nThe three of us had lunch and played board games all afternoon. It honestly felt like we were back to when we were kids and the three of us would hang out together. It was nice. \n\nI left at around 6. She was sad but she understood. When I hugged her good-bye, she whispered \"I love you\" to me but then said how she's happy I was able to find the happiness she couldn't give me. That part got to me to be honest and I was fighting back tears. I told her I'd see her again soon and she asked if I could bring my kids next time. I told her I would and left to pick up dinner for my family. \n\nI told my wife everything that happened and she was quite happy about the outcome. I guess it helped that I brought home her favorite food but she also agreed to let me bring the kids next time. \n\nOverall, it was a great experience seeing her again. I feel like I needed that and would've regretted not doing so. \n\nAgain, I'd like to thank everyone who gave me advice. Also, please don't roast my ex too much. She made a mistake and paid the price but it doesn't mean shes an evil person. \n\nThis will be my last update. Thank you very much, reddit.",

My grandpa was dying and my parents wanted me to say goodbye, I was about 10 and didn't really understand the concept of death. But I did understand the fear in his eyes, him struggling to breath and him begging a hallucination of his mother to let him live and how he didnt wanna die and wasnt ready.\n\nNow that was terrible for me, I realized about 10+ years after what that actually did to my mental health, I have PTSD which I have been working through but its been real rough. I just wish I could feel like I am immortal like other young people my age (early 20s) but my mortality is a constant thing in my head, and a lot of the times it takes complete control of all of my thoughts.",

Regardless of how you may feel about it individually, for most people, when you marry someone, you are effectively making a promise. In many cultures (specifically Catholicism or similar), it's not even effectively, it's literally. You're promising to stay faithful and true, and you're making that promise of your own free will, to someone you have chosen. I absolutely agree that the Western insistence on Catholic style marriage practices is silly, but if you agree to something with someone you claim to love, and then go back on your word, that's on you, not on the general culture that led to that promise.\n\ntldr: Cheating isn't bad because it's having relations outside of your marriage, it's because you're breaking a promise (explicit or implicit) to someone you say you love.",

This is perhaps my one exception. I genuinely, really feel this only happened the one time and she genuinely realized how bad she fucked up, and the fact that she had the balls to tell him I do respect. This actually destroyed her, but not in the violent explosive sense, the quiet sad and pathetic sense. So pathetic I legit feel bad for her.\n\nAll that said OP still had every right to leave her and should feel no responsibility toward her, she still made her bed.",

In those cultures, without the knowledge of death imposing on life, patients report higher qualities of life (less depression, less stress, for example) than patients with similar diagnosis and prognosis in places where they are fully informed. Patients also tend to live longer in the former. \n\nMeanwhile, there are people like Jon Kabat-Zinn who found that patients who learn mindfulness meditation also report higher quality of life and have longer lives despite terminal diagnosis. \n\nWhat some scientists and doctors believe is that the mind has the ability  to drive the success of treatment or the damage of disease. This isn\u2019t saying \u201cyou can will away a terminal disease\u201d but more \u201cyour mindset can help your body by way of hormones\u201d or \u2018your mindset can create additional havoc by way of hormones.\u201d \n\nWhen I imagine spending my life in a living mausoleum of the one great relationship I had, knowing that I ruined with it cheating, it feels absolutely crushing. \n\nTen years. Ten years of looking at your photos, remembering the life she had and threw away. An entire lifetime of a relationship, ruined. Here, in the last months her life, the thing she wanted most was to be able to have new memories with you. \n\nSurrounded by daily reminders of her mistakes, knowing how she hurt you, and being so close to how you have a life she wanted (even if she is the one who messed it up) so much can\u2019t have been healthy. \n\nI applaud you for putting the relationship you had with your friend over the negativity she caused as your wife in order to practice  empathy. it\u2019s a great tribute to the relationship you have with your current wife that she understood and feels comfortable enough in your marriage to allow it.",

Time moved on and he remained living in her dream home, surrounded by the paint she chose, the curtains she made, with every dish and spice where she decided it should be stored. A year or so later, he moved his girlfriend in and she complained that she didn\u2019t feel like she was in her home, but more like she was visiting a relative. He wouldn\u2019t let her change anything. This went on for several years. I realized it was a giant memorial and she was living in it. Even the calendar on the wall was set to the month when the wife had died. \n\nThere was something about OP\u2019\u2019s story of his exwife leaving the house exactly as he\u2019d left it while she sat by and died that make me think of it, of how much a tortured existence it was, but it was what she chose for herself. \n\nUltimately, we may make really bad mistakes and hurt people around us. In a perfect world that wouldn\u2019t happen. In a closer to perfect world, though, we see what we\u2019ve done and work to never repeat our actions. The realization, the working towards being better, and the follow through are probably as close to that perfect world we can hope for.",

It's tempting to fall into that same behavior (ask me how I know...), but try not to.

I don't doubt that some people were being pretty heartless about this particular situation, but the labeling that's going on here is not helpful. I wouldn't straight label myself a libertarian (there's a lot of baggage that comes with any label), but I do have some libertarian beliefs for sure, and wouldn't describe my beliefs as \"fuck you, got mine\". Personally, as somebody who is \"pretty libertarian\", I found this story to be quite heartwarming. Choked up a little bit and all. Because some of us do actually have hearts, you know.",

That's just sort of weird. \n\nIt sounds like what happened was much more normal than that, thankfully. Maybe a better way to put it is that she wanted to feel a sense of normalcy, in the way that she defined it for so much of her life? It makes me very sad for the ex-wife to think what small scraps she wants at the end of her life: to be able to pretend that a person who is openly not interested in her still is just for a moment. \n\nIt may be that leaving her childhood sweetheart was the right thing to do (he certainly seems much happier), but it makes me sad to think that she didn't go on to have better relationships in her life after that. It's a good reminder to learn to live with our choices, and make the most of the time we have.",

After a while the marriage broke down and my Mom ended up cheating on my Dad.  They would eventually divorce.  My brother and I stayed with my Mom and I saw my Dad on weekends.  \n\nMy Mother was a very difficult person all her life.  She was always one to try and get a free meal by complaining, or would always find one way or another not to work.  Stuff like that.  My Dad was very much the opposite, so you can see why things didn't work. \n\nMy Dad remarried and has been for almost 15 years now.  All the time since my parents divorced my Mother never took care of herself and became addicted to opiates, all stemming from a back injury she had. \n\nAbout a year before my Mother passed, which was this last July, she started to really reach out to my Father just to talk to him.  Not sure if it was because of he lack of friends, or just that she felt most comfortable with him.  She never changed her last name from his and also never removed photos off the wall.  That kind of thing.  \n\nMy Dad proceeded much as you did, with precautions in place.  I haven't really had a chance to get his take on things recently, but I know he is happy that he spent that extra time with her.  Not because he missed their Marriage, but because he remembers who that person was to him at one time, and he is a good enough man to give that to someone before they die.  I look up to my Father for what he did with my Mom in her dieing days, regardless of the shitty things she always did to him.  Be proud of how you are handling this.  It takes a big man.",

But, you and your wife are amazingly strong and I know folks have already talked about the relationship with you and your wife and connections with your ex and all that. It sounds like you two have or are making strides towards peace, which I hope is great for all of you, and wish nothing but the best to you all. Fingers crossed on things going well if you take the kids!\n\nBut I'm looking at your sister. \n\nYour sister, who is your twin, and knows the whole story, probably saw and (though you didn't mention as much as I'd have asked about with the support through all this, *hopefully*) was torn about supporting her best friend and you as two people she cared about... your sister who has seen you fall in love and be happy and become a parent and all this. Who has known your wife for something like at least 7 years and still felt alright with pressuring the two of you to accept this, especially knowing your history with concerns about marriage vows and fidelity and feeling fully engaged in your loving, happy new life. I would really be looking at the boundaries or lack thereof that made her feel comfortable negotiating your boundaries between you and your ex wife. Like, WHAT? Heatedly arguing with you by phone and in your own home regarding you being asked to fulfill the dying wish of her best friend? Also, from the way you say it, it sounds like she implied obligation or requirement on your part to save this person's feelings. Yes, this is a terrible position for all involved, but I really would encourage you to look at the way Sis regards your feelings and safety as opposed to her ends or others she holds dear. \n\nYou're obviously a strong person, as well as your wife, and it takes a strong emotional maturity to walk into a situation like this with someone else's good at the forefront while maintaining and safely checking your boundaries. Even with all that, this is probably exhausting for all parties, and I wish you the best. And I also hope I'm wrong about your sister. Maybe you two are notorious for blunt and direct interventions, and involvement in each other's relationships is par for the course. But it feels like there's something there on that emotional lack of cognizance or at least of consideration of you, and I'd keep an eye on that. Take care, OP",

Our marriage had basically ended before that but we stayed for the kid.  I never cheated but it's probably because I was a mess of a person...riddled with panic attacks that didn't help things.  When I found out about the affairs, we had just conceived our 2nd so she was pregnant (yes it's mine).  It rocked my world and the only reason I stayed is for that baby girl inside her.  \n\nOver the pregnancy we fixed things...fell in love...and 4 years later are in a spot neither of us would have guessed. \n\nBut I struggle...nearly daily with the fallout.  Existing poor self image coupled with the ammo of the affairs really shits on me.  \n.\nI really enjoyed reading your story.  It has so many angles.  For me, I can tell she was sorry.  It doesn't take any bullshit away...but to feel the remorse she felt in your story really hit me. It's SO HARD to feel like my wife is sorry no matter how many times she's proven it.  I guess I'm too close to the fire to see it.  But seeing it in someone else helps me see it in my wife.  \n\nI've really fucking struggled the last 2 weeks.  Remote teaching sucks, I gained weight during the pandemic, and I've felt generally shitty about myself.  Snapped at my kids, my wife...and would rather be alone.  I think reading your story, and seeing her remorse...as well as the support your current wife showed you really helped me.  I needed a change of perspective and you provided that.  \n\nSeeing the way you handled it... without the \"fuck you\" attitude you could have had ...is awesome.  Sometimes I have that fuck you attitude and it helps nothing",

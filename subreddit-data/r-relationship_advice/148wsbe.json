    "postText": "First things first I want to apologize for any formatting issues, I'm on mobile. \n\nOkay so Iknow we haven't been together terribly long (only 7 months) and we're both young but I'm just a little concerned. In the beginning, when they were trying to win me over and flirt with me and everything they were so sweet, texted all the time, and was very generous when it came to physical affection.\n I came to visit them (we live a ways away now as they were planning on moving when we first met) they have been like a completely different person. They won't talk to me about much unless I initiate. They won't hold my hand for God's sake. I was curious if it was a PDA thing but if that's the case why won't they hold my hand in the comfort of their own home?\nI had tried to talk to them about it but they weren't very responsive. One comment that stands out to me is that they said \"I told you I'm a shitty person to date when we got together\". I've just been in my head and any comments would help. \n\n\nTLDR: My SO has completely changed how they act towards me and I don't know how to approach them about it.",

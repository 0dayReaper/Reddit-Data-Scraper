            "comment": "His comment saying that he doesn\u2019t care what age you are as long as you can help him mentally OR PHYSICALLY is a big red flag. He doesn\u2019t care that you are underaged and probably wouldn\u2019t care if you were even younger. You feel grownup at 17/18 but you aren\u2019t ready for a relationship (and in my opinion a first time) with someone as old as 24. You won\u2019t really get it yet but it is WEIRD. To be safe I would hold off and cut contact with him even if it feels exciting and new and maybe it even feels comforting and reassuring that someone likes you, but i don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to start this with someone that old. the age gap at your particular age is very sensitive and much bigger than if it were 30 and 34 or something like that. Whatever you do, please please be careful. If you do not take this advice and meet up with him, take pepper spray, and let someone know, even if it\u2019s just your friend, that you are going on a walk with someone new and that if you don\u2019t text back within a certain timeframe they should call help. Make sure you have a safety net because this scenario does not seem safe to me.",

You should be concerned about the age gap, and one day you'll probably understand why. \n\nA 24 year old should not be trying to hooking up with teenagers, and especially finding out about your age should've sent him running to the hills. \n\n&gt;I mean like I told you if you can fill my loneliness mentally or   \nphysically or both I really don\u2019t care about ur age if it\u2019s ok for you   \nas well\n\nAlso, he wants to use you to fix his issues.

You\u2019re still \u201ctechnically\u201d not legal in some places (I don\u2019t know where you live) but always be careful with age gaps like this. He will most likely be looking for something \u201cintimate\u201d from you. Most guys that age would not normally talk to someone still in there teens. As for a relationship, it might be extremely hard to relate to each other in every day conversations as you\u2019re in different areas of life. He is probably out of college, working, and looking to make some permanent changes in where he lives, his job, and who he sees. You\u2019re just now getting out of high school (or still in) and deciding whether college is for you, should you travel, should you start work, should you take a gap year, etc. don\u2019t let the feelings of wanting to be in a relationship slow down all of the other aspects of your life you should enjoy as you\u2019re still so young! Think it through, maybe go on a walk, talk with him, but don\u2019t let it progress further. Be careful of manipulation on his part and make sure you always feel comfortable in the situation!",

Talk with trusted adults or friends about this before and after as they can lend a helping ear, as they should be more experienced in relationships. Since you\u2019re so inexperienced, you\u2019re more easily manipulated, as it\u2019s all new to you, but not new to him. Really think about if this is something you need need at this moment but also have fun! It\u2019s exciting going into the dating world, just make sure to stay safe and know that your priorities and concerns are valid, no matter what the person your seeing says otherwise.",

    "postText": "\r  \nMy bf (36M) and I (23f) have been dating for 11 months now. We got together one month after his ex (25F) broke up with him. Even though i had doubts at first, because it was too soon after his BU, he told me he is over her, and has been before her breaking up with him. We hit it off fast. He invited me to spend summer holidays with him, i met his dad, posted me on social media after one month of us dating, spoiled me, gave me flowers and treated me like a princess right since we met. He told me his ex was trying to get back together when we met, but said he didnt want to get back because she treated him bad.\r  \n\r  \nI moved to his place a few months into the relationship, and even though everything was nice between us and i felt like he adored me, we still had some fights and now i found out during those fights he texted his ex. We had fights like once per month, nothing too serious and i dont understand why he texted her.\r  \n\r  \nI read the texts and he was telling her that he still loves her, that she is special, that he doesnt love me but i give him attention and i treat him better then her, that she betrayed him by leaving him, that i would never leave him. That i am a nice and smart girl but im not like her. He never said anything bad about me, but still. Then, when we would make up, his texts to her would stop. He did this for 11 months, one fight between us, and he either texted or called her, telling her directly or not how he still has feelings for her, and then would ghost her. She would then ask him why is he saying all this stuff and got together with me knowing she wanted to resolve things between them and he would stop responding. All the dates coincided with our fights.\r  \n\r  \nSeeing those texts made me feel so bad, because one - hes been telling me how much he loves me, and made me feel special and treated me like a queen only to find out that he is lying. And then, seeing how he gave her hopes, knowing she wanted to get back together. She told him in one of the messages that she was suffering and crying all day and he was leading her on.\r  \n\r  \nHe even told one of his friends that he doesnt love me. How? I ve only felt loved from him, i was on cloud nine. He did things for me no one has done before, he acted like i was the love of his life. We spent Christmas together, met all of his family and friends, we are together 24/7. I dont want to confront him because i saw the texting without his consent. He forgot his phone at home and his dad called him, i answered to tell him his son forgot the phone and then i got curious and i went on whatsapp. So not very nice of me.\r  \n\r  \nTl;dr: I (23F) found out my bf (36M) texted his ex gf everytime we fought, for 11 months",

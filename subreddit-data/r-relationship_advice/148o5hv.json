For context, I\u2019m on the pill and take it regularly. \nThis situation started out as a bedroom thing, he has a breeding kink and I love how turned on he gets when I beg for his child. But recently he\u2019s been telling me he\u2019s going to \u201cget rid of your birth control\u201d and \u201cmaybe the pills will stop working\u201d during sex and every time I take them and he\u2019s around I catch him giving me a kind of unsettling smile that makes me pretty uncomfortable. I\u2019m not really sure when I started noticing that look but he may have finished in me while he started looking at me like that. I\u2019m on vacation with family so he\u2019s not with me but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m being paranoid or not. The pills look normal and the packages don\u2019t look tampered with. Is there any way he could have messed with them? I\u2019ve gone through a few pregnancy tests and I\u2019m really freaking out.",

At that point I started watching her take the pill. Then I caught her being weird using the microwave. She stood in front of it as I came home from work and just stared at me asking me about the day. She later came to the room and asked where was her food? She said \"food?\" I said yea whatever you were warming up. She paused then said it was popcorn. She came with popcorn 5 minutes later. Later on it hit me, she had made the popcorn after she said it was popcorn. When I came from work and she was microwaving I didn't smell popcorn. Only after she said she made it because she went to go make it after. \n\nI confronted her about this afte the miscarriage and that's when I ended things.",

Emergency contraception is used to reduce the chance of pregnancy after unprotected sex (if other birth control failed or was not used). It is not for routine contraceptive use.\n\nStraight from the FDA. Backup method of birth control. Not necessarily birth control. Only reduce the chances not eliminate them. Like I said in another comment if she has ovulated it does absolutely nothing. Stop messing with hairs. My Entire reply was telling her you cannot use it as a form of birt control. Even if don't use it everytime you have sex using it multiple times a year is still non advisable. You're making it out as if it is just as effective and can be taken as routinely as regular efficient birth control. You can't. Now take a few steps back and stop embarrasing yourself.",

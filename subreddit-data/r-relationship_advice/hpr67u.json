    "postText": "I've been dating this girl for over 5 years. She's very special to me. Even at this point, I can't help but hope she's not too worried about why I've been acting so oddly. I honestly was planning to marry her sometime in the future as soon as we settled into our adult lives.\n\nOne day we were chilling at her house when I asked her if she could send me the funny picture she took earlier that day of one of our puppies. She was busy on her pc so she told me to just grab her phone to send it to myself. When I went into her phone gallery I noticed a \"hidden\" folder which I hadn't seen before. out of curiousity I opened it. It was filled with her nudes. Most I've already seen. Some of which she's never sent to me before. I thought maybe she was stockpiling for whenever I asked for any. I clicked on a video. It was a sextape. It was from the POV of the guy but the thing is. I dont remember ever filming it. It 100% wasnt me. trust me, i know what my own schlong looks like. My girlfriend recorded having sex with another man. \n\nFor the last 5 years. We've had a few share of fights, but nothing too serious. She'd always make me feel loved and I could tell she really cares about me. Or at least I thought she did. After I returned her phone to her, I quickly got up and went home. I couldn't stay there any longer. And now I'm here. I dont really know what to do. I'm planning on confronting her and breaking it off but right now I'm just so in shock. 5 years down the drain. and I feel like I just lost my best friend. I'm not really sure how to feel. I can't think straight. What would be the best way to handle this situation?",

I say just get to the bottom of it. \n\nIf it does turn out to be a breakup, at least you found out before settling down with her.",

It is better to have as much information as possible before confronting in the off chance it is not what it looks like. Though admittedly that chance is very small. \n\nAs evidence it is useless that much is true.",

It was disgusting cause it means he crept up the stairs and watched like a creep the whole time probably.

Absolutely nothing inappropriate had ever happened or I\u2019d have called them out, but he got so weird about stuff like \u201clunch was awesome today\u201d (we all went out w the boss) and \u201clooking forward to spending time together next week\u201d (in a group of 6 people who had been trying to get a meeting together for awhile). He would quote this shit and act all psycho. So that\u2019s just what I said: \u201cnothing about this is anything but appropriate, but I deleted them because fuck you for looking in my phone!\u201d I really should have figured something else out I guess :(\n\nP.S. turns out he was the one cheating. :( \nP.P.S. also I\u2019m in a much better relationship now. :)",

            "comment": "Kinda disagree with people telling OP to check the date before thinking anything. \n\nSince he said the video was located near the bottom of the album and she has an iPhone, this usually always means it\u2019s one of the most recent additions (ie: most recent date of creation) to the folder. \nOP also said that he recognises some of the pictures as ones she has sent to him. If the ones he recognised were higher up in the album and if the date sorting is set to how all iPhones are as default then that would mean the video was taken after. \n\nFor arguments sake, if the video was taken BEFORE they started dating, then why does she have a video of her with another guy on her phone from over five years ago? In that time she probably would\u2019ve changed devices so that means she would\u2019ve sent it to her new phone. \nThat\u2019s weird and inappropriate anyway. \n\nOP, you should definitely talk to her about it and be honest, I just don\u2019t think the date of the video makes it any better. Or at least it wouldn\u2019t if I were in your position. \n\nGood luck, OP.",

If you have stuff over at her place, have her box it up and put somewhere so you or a friend can do a quick drive-by and pick it up. Second, **get tested for STDs.** You don't know this guy and for all you know, you could be carrying a disease that won't manifest itself until months from now.

For women especially, if the goal is to meet someone, get married, and start a family while still young and healthy (I.E. under 30) then finding a future husband before 25 makes sense.\n \nWe would be a lot better off if we were raised to take relationships more seriously, not play the hook up game, and focus on finding wives and husbands when we are still young enough to build a real life together.  For thousands of years humans were able to have relationships that lasted, and were truly meaningful, by focusing on meeting a spouse and being monogamous at younger ages. It is only recently that this has become a problem.",

It's up to you to decide if that is something that is a deal-breaker for you or not. but the same time being in a relationship with 5 years I think you have a pretty good relationship with your girlfriend. so it would take the time to actually talk to her. And tell her the things that are bothering you. If you don't like her answers or actually think she's actually cheating because of the responses she's giving. Then you have your answer but I think some people do need some closure. Ever after such a long of time. I also think after 5 years you do deserve some type of answers. And you seem like a really respectful person. I also think you need those answers to move on.. Just keep your head up and listen to your gut.",

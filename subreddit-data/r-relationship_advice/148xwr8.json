I can see myself being with him as he\u2019s a cool person and seems he can provide for me well. I\u2019m terrified of what my family would think even tho my aunts and cousins have similar age gaps in their relationships. Their opinion wouldn\u2019t change how I feel or my decision to date him. He has some minor red flags but not something that can\u2019t be worked on, I like him and he really likes me but I honestly don\u2019t know if it\u2019s okay? Legal, yes, but is it that bad to have a 10 year age gap? Pls Lmk as I\u2019d like for things to get serious but I\u2019m terrified of what others would think even though it shouldn\u2019t matter.",

Like do you think when you\u2019re 30, you\u2019ll look at a 19 as a viable romantic partner? Or does the thought gross you out?\n\nWhy isn\u2019t he dating someone in his immediate age group? A lot of people on this sub will say it\u2019s cause women his age will call him out on his bad behavior. But a 19 y/o that might not have too many relationships under her belt might not notice. (like those \u201cminor\u201d red flags you mentioned - a 30 y/o woman might recognize those as major ones and dip immediately.)\n\nAnd let\u2019s say he is serious about you, don\u2019t you think there will be a power imbalance (he has more life experience than you, been independent longer, etc)? \nI mean you\u2019re still worried about what your family might think. \n\nWill he always be teaching you how to do styff? Will he respect your opinion, rather than dismissing it because you\u2019re younger and \u201cdon\u2019t know better?\u201d I\u2019m not sure what age sex drive starts to wane, but it def will on his side eventually - while you\u2019re just starting yours (i assume).\n\nIt\u2019s just a whole lot of cons - when you can find someone that is your age, your level of experience, etc.",

He remembers Y2K, 9/11 and those sorts of things.  You had different cultural norms and had different experiences in your childhoods.\n\nHe will have had ten to twelve years doing adult things while you are just recently coming out of childhood.\n\nLet me just say this, if you know what you're getting into.  If you understand that you have different experiences and know that you will probably have to be counting on him for your lifestyle, whether you work or not, this is **100% OK**.\n\nIt's definitely unquestionably weird, but that doesn't make it wrong.  *Be sure* that this is what you want, but if you've counted the costs and know that you can bond with this man, fearlessly move forward with him.",

As for the red flags, without knowing what they are, about all that can be said is that everyone has red flags. If we're talking still lives with his parents, no go.

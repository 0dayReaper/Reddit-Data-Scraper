    "postText": "\nBefore we got into this relationship we were in a situationship. We shared things a lot, we had disagreements but we had a lot of fun and memories. On new year 2023, I offer him to have a commitment with me, he rejects and said he is not ready. I was so sad, like really sad. And beside i just moved town to town so i got not that much friends, he was really important. At that time, I thought our relationship is really fucked, like there is no going back. So, me and him working at the same restaurant, there were two girls working with us invited me to visit an old lady on New year, i accepted. On the way, they asked me if I like any guys, I said \u201ci dont want to tell you\u201d, they kept guess \u201cis it H? We know that you guys have something\u201d, at that point i have already fell in love with him, and also i really need someone to give some advice for me, so I said \u201cyes, is H, can you guys give me some advice? He really important to me\u201d And i started to tell them the story. I didnt tell my bf that i told them even he told not to tell anyone because i dont know how to tell him at that moment when we were arguing about commitment, and the fact i told them at that time was so less important, cause in mind mind at that time, i just want to fix the relationship so much. And time past, i dont pay attention to that conversation with the girls anymore. \nThe disagreement between me and my bf continue for quite a long time, till the point we got exhausted and fight a lot. We decided to stopped the situationship. Of course I cired a lot. And one day, others co worker (not ther girls) told me that my bf talked shit behind me, and just see me as an option ( they didnt have proof). I was very sad but still i decided to talk to my bf. He denied it and he got some proof. He was really sad but i was there for him. After that he asked me to be his gf. We were really happy and care for each other. Although we still have small fight cause im way younger than him, im very childish and stubborn. \nFew days ago, somethings happened, and one of the girls in the past, told him that i told everything about our past relationship for them. He was really mad, because he found out everything by himself. He said he got trust issues now and he really tired because of dramas (the coworkers that talk shit about him to me). \nHe said he cant do this relationship no more. I know my fault very much and im fucking regret it. I wish i did think about consequences before i told the girls, i really didnt mean it, no harm in it, but i hurt him :( i really want to fix things but he dont want it. What should I do? And please dont come after me guys. I know its my faults and I have learned it. I just want to save this relatioship.",

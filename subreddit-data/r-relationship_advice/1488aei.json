    "postText": "Pretty sure this is the kind of place to ask this question. I am a mature age student, (39M) and there is another student (19F) in the same class who is quite infatuated with me. She will stare at me during class, take bathroom breaks at the same time as me so we walk down that hall together, she doesn't actuall follow me into the bathroom. She also waits for me after class to walk out to the car together. She tries to be paired with me for assessments but I have since  made my lecturer aware and he intervenes and ensures she is paired off with someone else. Recently though, I found out she has applied to do her practical placement at the same place I have and said \"I can't wait to do prac with you, I don't think I can do it without you\" I have in no way encouraged her behaviour, she has invited me to social things outside of class and I have politely declined. My main concern is, this person can become quite unpredictable emotionally, even in class. She has cried and derailed our in class sessions a few times with personal issues. I am a private person and an older man and don't want to be made out to be a creep or worse either. Any advice on how to curb this infatuation?",

Like, something that leaves a trace. \n\nThis girl seems to be highly unstable. I say this with no offensive intent and with full respect towards her issues. But you can't trust her to have a composed reaction when she makes a move on you and you reject her. With proof that you made the university aware of the situation, nobody can ever blame you. \n\nIn the meantime, as other commenters suggested, avoid being alone with her and, if possible, keep declining any invitation (by anyone, not just her) to social events where she could be ambiguous towards you in front of others.",

And once that happens, especially in the position you're in (much older man, barely 19 year old girl, university), this is the prime position for her to lodge any kind of complaint against you of inappropriate or sexually incorrect behaviour as revenge.",

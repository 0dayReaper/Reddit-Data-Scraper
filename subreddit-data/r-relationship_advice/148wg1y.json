    "postText": "We bought our house 2 years ago and immediately upon moving in met the neighbors at the local park in our neighborhood.\nThey have a young child and so do we and the kids started playing together. Right away the dad came out (their house backs up onto the park) and started chatting with us. He was an over sharer from the get go and told us he is on disability and his wife is his caretaker. We were cordial and made small talk then parted ways. My husband and I both commented that he was a bit of an odd fellow. But nice enough. \n\nA few days later they were out walking and stopped by our house to tell us about a neat park in the area. Nice enough, sure.\n\nThe day after that they stopped over to bring us some food they had made and welcome us to the neighborhood. Also quite thoughtful.\n\nThey go out on anywhere from 3-5 walks per day. They walk the street that our house is on. This leads to a chit chat every single time we see them. Which is literally any time we\u2019re in our yard and frequently as we\u2019re putting the kids in the car or taking groceries out. They\u2019re very chatty and it\u2019s difficult to break away. \n\nOur kids became friends and we invited them to our sons birthday party. Immediately after the party they started suggesting that we get together. We obliged and invited them over for drinks one Saturday night. They were very strange and the husband said a few odd things. For example he flippantly threw out there that he has a porn addiction and also that he has cheated on his wife but they\u2019re working on their marriage. We barely know these people. It was odd. \n\nMy husband and I both felt the visit was exhausting and vowed never to do it again. They texted the very next day inviting us over that weekend. We declined and the next day after that the husband texted me asking if I could come help him with a project he had and bring the family and they would order pizza. I said we were busy. \n\nThe following week they rang our doorbell again offering cookies they had made. \n\nA few weeks later they texted and said they had bought a birthday gift for our younger child even though they had only met her twice. They asked if they could come over that week to give it to her. We agreed and they came by but we didn\u2019t invite them in. Of course we thanked them for their kind gesture but we were short. \n\nThey then began texting asking to see pictures of our kid in the outfit they bought her. I said our child wasn\u2019t very cooperative and I\u2019d snap a pic if I could. I never attempted and they stopped asking. They did not however stop asking to get together. \n\nMy husband and I have run out of excuses. Every time they invite us over we say we are busy. And more often than not, we are. They get frustrated and ask how much advance notice we need to hang out. We explained that we don\u2019t have a lot of extra time and are typically very busy. Which is true.\n\nNeither of them work and they are young and obviously bored. We feel bad but we do not want to be friends with these people. We don\u2019t jive well and frankly the husbands comments have been very off putting. It also bothers me that they attempt to manipulate hangouts. Our older kids still play at the local park together and it feels like there is no avoiding them. Our kid really likes their kid and considers him a good friend. \n\nThey will not stop requesting a get together and inviting us to dinner. We run into them in our driveway multiple times per week and it is making living here a chore. I don\u2019t want to have to make small talk every time I leave my house. What do we do? I would love to be up front and honest but our kids play and it would be so awkward. I also feel like we have been pretty clear that we don\u2019t have time for more socializing. \n\nAny advice from anyone?",

    "postText": "My boyfriend (26m) and I (37f) have been together for eight months, things have been great but.. I adopted my dog about a year before we got together. My dog was already a year old when I found him, covered in fleas (so bad that frontline didn\u2019t work so I had to shell out the $70 for a Seresto collar) , he had no leash training (jumping, pulling, he\u2019s half husky so one day he literally pulled me down through the park face-first because he saw another dog he wanted to play with, I was covered in mud from my face to my shoes), he would snatch food from plates, you guys know the rest. \nI\u2019ve made a lot of improvements with him, none of the terrible behaviors exist anymore beyond the peeing. I have two cats so obviously I have a litter box for them. My dog gets confused and thinks that the litter box area is also his pee area. I\u2019ve tried everything, I give him treats when he goes outside, I crate him when he\u2019s peed in the house, nothing is working. I\u2019ve resorted to putting pee pads in front of the litter box which he uses so that\u2019s a plus I guess? My boyfriend says I have to re-home him if he doesn\u2019t cut this behavior out. I don\u2019t want to end my relationship but I have never and will never adopt an animal in need and abandon it.\nAdvice please, thank you!",

They were potty trained, but that\u2019s about it. They were 7&amp;5 years old and no one had trained them. I tried to get my husband to train them, but he just tolerated their erratic behavior. I almost left him because of it. \n\nUltimately I decided it was unfair to the dogs to let them continue to not know how to behave. I trained them and they became much better dogs. \n\nYour boyfriend is giving you an ultimatum. It\u2019s not up to him to train your dog, but it is up to you to actively and preemptively train your dog. Treat it like you would a puppy, and house train it. That means taking it outside to pee after each meal, and rewarding him when he comes back in. \n\nAlso, crate him when you aren\u2019t home to supervise him. Crates are a source of comfort for dogs, but you\u2019re using it as punishment. Your dog needs consistency. \n\nIf you are so die hard about never rescuing and then abandoning an animal, then either do it the justice it deserves, or give up on your conviction. \n\nThis isn\u2019t really about your boyfriend threatening to break up. It\u2019s about you doing a disservice to the dog you claim to be devoted to.",

Put in the time, effort, and cost it takes both to properly train your dog and deep clean your house.

Basically, you need to act like your dog is a new puppy, and take him out as much as you would a new puppy.

He\u2019s confused, and likely doesn\u2019t know what you want. You have to show dogs what you want them to do, while not focusing on the wrong things they do. Like with potty training, I never once scolded or told my puppies no when they had an accident (this is vital btw, you unintentionally reinforce behaviors by acting negatively). I just calmly cleaned it up with no reaction, but they got a ton of treats and praise for going outside. I also watched them like a hawk for any sign they were needing to go and ran them outside- you want to prevent accidents as much as possible. If this means you go outside 20x a day, that\u2019s what you have to do for a short amount of time. Mine were both trained within a few weeks. \n\nOh- and try using a clicker for training. I have an elderly dog as well as my two puppies, and she has always been resistant to learning new stuff. Used a clicker with my new puppies and she IMMEDIATELY picked up on training. It like clicked (hahah) in her brain.",

Have them give you homework.  Sounds silly, but this will be a part time job. Just like a relationship. \n\n2. Talk to your bf. If he never had a pet, he's seeing one at their worst. He needs to he part of the solution, and not just an in/out decider.\n\n3. Couples therapy. You both have to want this. You always need couples therapy BEFORE you think you need it. \n(You do maintenance on your car, so it doesn't break,  not after.....)\n\n4. COMMUNICATE with your bf. Comprise. \n\n5. It could also be, since your dog was a stray, that your dog MAY be an outdoor dog. If he is staying inside most of the day, relocation may be best for the pups.\n\n\nHope this helps",

All I could think was someone bad will find him and do something awful. The city I live in is known for dog-fighting so I couldn\u2019t just leave him there with these people giving him away.",

We have one.\n\nThe gate will block the doorway of the room where you have your litter boxes but there is a small door toward the bottom you can leave open to allow your cat to go in and out of the room. \n\nSo this gives easy access to the litter box for your cats and zero access to the litter box for your dog.\n\nThe gate also opens for us humans to easily go through.\n\nYour dog is being triggered to urinate by the urine and feces smell coming from the litter box. \nIf he has no access, he won\u2019t be triggered or tempted.\n\nI would almost 100% guarantee that your dog has been eating the cat feces too. Because that\u2019s what they do.\n\nThere is a reason why when potty training your puppy, you should always take your puppy out to the exact same place every time to pee or poop. \nThe reason being the scent of previous pee and poop spots   will trigger your puppy to do his or her business there again. \n\u2026 in the yard and not inside your house\u2026\n\nHope this helps\u2026Good luck!",

When they would pee inside, and it was at that moment i'd pull them to the pee and put their noses close to it. And tell them \"no, you don't pee there\" take them outside to go potty. Reward them if they went outside with a treat and tell them how good they did. If they didnt id take them to their crate for a little while and then try again outside. Sometimes you have to walk them for 30mins or so. But it might be different for a male dog since they have to mark their territory. You can also try a dog version of a liter box. Its a patch of grass in a box. You should look it up. Order it. And put it next to the cats liter box. Also get rid of the bf. His love and loyalty sounds shaky.",

They literally have no freaking idea why you are doing that to them, and often, they think it\u2019s because they peed in front of you, so they start hiding to do it. It can cause the opposite behavior to what you want. Any dog trainer would tell you this is abusive. \n\nProper training is to completely ignore accidents- no negative or positive reaction, just calmly clean it up. What you want to do is to take them outside at first as much as possible to prevent any accidents, as well as watching them for any signs whatsoever that they have to go, and clicking/marking and treating them when they do go outside. Any accident inside is your own fault for not watching them closely enough- they understand it really quickly. I got two puppies last year and only had a handful of accidents between the two of them early on. Had both of them (very different personalities and opposite sex) telling me when they needed to go outside without a super short amount of time. No horrible techniques needed.",

This will be a process. The pee pads and making it easier probably wasn't the best, but it can be undone. Start on a weekend when you can stay home and just watch like a vulture.\n\nOr: block the room for the dog but leave it so the cats can get in- fence with a cat sized opening. Taking away the temptation helps.\n\n2nd issue: Your boyfriend sucks. No one gives up on pets unless they kill and eat a small child.

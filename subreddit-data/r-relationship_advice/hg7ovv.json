    "postText": "We've been married for almost 2 years now. My wife works as a flight attendant and is often doing long journeys to other countries. Her work has not slowed down during the covid quarantine as I thought it would so she is constantly working and has been tested negative several times now. \n\nOur anniversary was last week and she was not going to be home for it so I decided to give her a surprise card and one of a few gifts, but I was going to bury it in her luggage suitcase before she was about to leave. That is when I found new looking white lace lingerie that I have never seen before, as well as a pair of heels that I do know of because I got them for her. As soon as I saw it there was ringing in my ears and it felt like the world had come to a halt. I have been trying to come up with reasonable explanations as to why she would have it, but none of them are in character for her as far as I am aware. That's why now I am fearing the worst, infidelity. She doesn't know I saw it because I didn't leave the gift and card but she has been back home since then and gone again. I am going crazy with the thoughts of her with another man but I don't have concrete proof before accusing her. I don't know how I'd even get solid evidence. Reddit please help me on what to do now because I am in a very bad place emotionally right now",

            "comment": "I need the definition of lingerie here, cause my husband calls any bra and pantie set that matches and is remotely lacy lingerie. If it was like a silk camisole, might be to sleep in. If it was a bra and pantie set, some girls just want to feel pretty. If it was a baby doll cami with like under wire and strappy things that are not remotely comfy.... Yeah no one buys those or takes those somewhere without the idea that someone is going to see them. If they still had the tags on that would be a different story. The heels are nbd. Sometimes flight attendants do go out if they have an overnight layover.",

Sometimes we just like to look good to feel good.  \n\nI've gotten fully dressed up -- including heels, lingerie, lipstick -- just for a completely platonic girls' night at a friend's apartment, because I rarely go out and it was a chance to feel fancy.  A woman wanting to wear nice things or look good doesn't inherently mean she's trying to fuck.\n\nIn general I think the \"talk to her\" advice is a good impulse, but tread carefully, OP.  If my husband sat me down for a \"talk\" about whether or not I'm cheating on him just because I packed a pair of heels and matching bra and panty set for myself, I'd be a bit annoyed by the assumption, to be honest.",

Even really really racy ones, depending on ops and wifes sex life, she could just be getting dressed up with a friend to eat ice cream in bed and just feel nice. Honestly IMO there's more of a chance this is for self-care than that its for cheating.",

We've got no reference on how high the high heels are- are they small block heels that she could be wearing for work, are they 'night out' shoes, or are they 8inch platforms that she wouldn't be able to keep on for 10minutes?\n\nAlso, he mentions the underwear is white. Now if she's wearing a light coloured blouse for work, a light coloured bra makes perfect sense as it wouldn't show through as much. And as you mentioned, some women wear matching sets as a form of self care/pampering.",

I stewed on it hard, I was pissed off for weeks even through a Christmas vacation her parents took us on. \n\nShe finally asked me what\u2019s going on with me and I snapped. \u201cWho the fuck is James and why is he texting you he loves you? What are you hiding from me?!?\u201d \n\nJames was her biological father, that I had never met, and I knew her moms husband was her stepdad but it never occurred to me that she was in contact with her dad.\n\n\nEdit: the wife was merely a girlfriend at the time, we moved in together rather fast but I regert nothing.

During that video chat she got a notification: \u201csorry babe \ud83d\ude22\u201d on TikTok.  I didn\u2019t even know she used that app.  I didn\u2019t say anything she quickly swiped it up as it was interrupting the agent speaking.  I stewed over it a couple weeks... finally confronting her with \u201cwho is messaging you on TikTok??!\u201d. She denied it and called me crazy but I was like \u201cI know you saw it I saw it when you did\u201d.  She was like, \u201cdid you consider it was a video notification??\u201d.  I honestly hadn\u2019t.  So I downloaded TikTok (gross) and searched \u201cSorry babe\u201d.  Sure as shit, there a thousand people asking about getting that notification on the same day...I looked like an idiot and had to apologize profusely for accusing her of cheating and being stand offish for almost a month.  \n\nDon\u2019t assume the worst, maybe she just likes dressing up and fantasizing, or takes pictures of herself and posts them anonymously.

If he calls or writes to her, she has time to divert and distract from the topic, the opportunity to calculate her responses. In person, a cornered person will usually admit guilt by trying too hard to control their behavior and will end up acting completely out of character.    \n  \n  Additionally, what if the lingerie is an innocent item purchased while away that she wants to keep hidden until a future time? (My doubts are on this one) But what if he confronts her while she is away and she leaves the conversation feeling attacked or resentful? We don't know their relationship, so what if she is still faithful but just unhappy enough to want an excuse?  \n  \n  **Edit:** There is an increase in suggestions that Malcolm Gladwell's *Talking To Strangers* is some sort of gospel for body language and that the new group think is that we can't tell when humans are behaving oddly because not everyone is predictable.  \n  \n  My answer to this is that OPs wife is not a stranger and he should be very aware of her behaviors enough to know when she is acting in a manner worthy of concern. That book is a solid read, but it doesn't examine long term relationships or life with a partner, thus really cannot relate to this post.",

I don't know if the woman is cheating or not. You can wear lingerie and heels, and it's not about having sex with men. I wear lingerie and heels almost every day because it makes me feel powerful and dressed-up. I recently dumped my partner and am taking a break from dating during COVID. I've worn lingerie during sex, definitely, but I also wear it and pack it because I like it.\n\nI am not promiscuous at all and have only had four sexual partners total at age 27. I have never cheated.\n\nEdit 2: The response was to the post above me, not the main post. \"I can not fathom a reason for the lingerie besides the worst.\" Well, I wear lingerie all the time just for myself, and that's a reason. Perhaps it was underwear that was just on sale that she liked. \n\nEdit 3: Stop responding to me if you are just going to insult me for liking to wear lingerie. You just do not understand women",

No real reason to shave my balls just to go pump gas and no ones gonna see them, but sometimes having a freshly shaved pair of balls makes me feel confident and attractive regardless.\n\nWe will often joke \"Who are you trying to impress?\" because we both know sometimes you just want to feel desirable, even if theres no one around to see it.It just feels good.",

So I'm not sure why he sounds upset about it in this post.\n\nEdit: Yikes, made it all the way to the bottom. Like driving past a bad car wreck, you don't wanna see it but you also just can't stop looking. The grand finale was a story about how he used to stand outside his parents' room, jerking it while listening to them. Hopefully I saved some people from having to go see the post history for themselves. You're welcome. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go pour acetone into my eyes.",

I have friends who work for just about every US airline besides mine, from regional to mainline to legacy, and NO ONE has worked anywhere near a full schedule in months. Tens of thousands of FAs have been asked to take leave and may be out of jobs come October. People who were IN training were sent home, and all further training has been suspended. The US is STILL at 68% below capacity compared to last year at this time.\n\nYou need to sit down with your wife and tell her what you were going to do with the gifts and what you found, and ask for an explanation. I'm not jumping straight to infidelity, but this job certainly makes it easy. There was a girl at my base who would print out her monthly schedule for her husband - but she'd add 2- and 3-day trips in there that didn't exist. On those days she'd \"go to work\" but she was actually flying to see her boyfriend. We also had a pilot who retired but didn't tell his wife. He'd also \"go to work\" but was going to his girlfriend's. His wife only found out when she ran into another pilot's wife at the grocery store, who asked how her husband was enjoying his retirement 0.o",

You should be able to access her online schedule somehow. If you happen to see a schedule that doesn't jive up with the days she is gone, that's going to be a huge thing. Crew members have frequently called off sick and went on vacations with their side chick/guy.\n\nTake a look at credit card and bank statements, make sure they are showing charges for the cities she is supposed to be in.\n\nGet a hold of her phone and search it. It requires coordination to get a schedule together with someone else. A burner email account or even phone might exist.\n\nI know from experience that this is how you are going to find out if there are shenanigans happening. IF she doesn't have a regular thing, it might just be a random people she is hooking up with, and you might not be able to ever prove it. If so, look for condoms or other evidence of sexy time.\n\nGood luck dude, there is a large segment of airline crew members that believe once you are out of the country/zipcode/ whatever, it doesn't count. I hope that is not the case with your wife. The airline industry leads to a lot of random hookups and marriage problems.\n\nAIDS = Airline Induced Divorce Syndrome.

    "postText": "I don\u2019t speak spanish and as a mexican and native american I feel ashamed. I\u2019m well within my native roots and I fell more in love being native than mexican. My mom is fully native american and my dad is Mexican. I was never taught spanish but I was taught the Navajo language. I stayed far far away from my mexican heritage because of how many shamed me for not knowing spanish when I was never taught. I was always made fun of by other mexicans in school and called a no sabo. My native friends and family always made me feel safe and secure, never made fun of me. I tried learning spanish but also was made fun of for that, it was always something! So I did my best to not involve myself of that side in any sort. I never cared to. I started dating my boyfriend and when he told me he was mexican it was kind of a deal breaker for me. I usually date native men but I thought to give it a try. In the first couple of months he shamed me for not knowing spanish(as expected) and when I met his family I felt even more embarrassed. Both of his parents do not speak english at all so I\u2019m never really able to connect with them. And when I go to family gatherings all of them speak spanish so I\u2019m just sitting there being bored. I feel like they think I\u2019m stuck up for not knowing or often times make jokes about me. I even think my boyfriend does it with his mom. I try to learn with him but I can\u2019t because it\u2019s too difficult for me to pronounce and understand. I just feel like it\u2019s a big issue for me and I can\u2019t go on to date him because of this. How should I handle this problem about our cultural difference?",

            "comment": "This is less about the cultural difference and more about your self-consciousness around your Mexican heritage, no? Because imagine if you dated a Korean guy, you would have the same issue of not being able to speak with his parents and the family gatherings may be a bit boring. But I predict it wouldn't feel as bad, you wouldn't assume they are making fun of you in Korean, and you may even try to learn a little Korean. But when it's Spanish, you feel self-conscious and ashamed because you have so many bad experiences associated with it.\n\nYou have two options, 1) break up with the guy and never date another guy who knows Spanish or has Hispanic family to save yourself the discomfort, or 2) try to use this as an opportunity to confront your discomfort/shame and work through it with your boyfriend's support. Btw you already know 2 languages, you are capable of learning languages, it's everything else that makes this so difficult and uncomfortable. \n\nI think both options are valid but if you really like the guy, it may be worth giving option 2 a try.",

He shouldn't be your BF, but I'd not necessarily give up on learning Spanish... Just maybe not from someone who is just going to look down on you for never having been taught by the person who was responsible for teaching you.",

            "comment": "This is less of a cultural difference and more about lack of communication.\n\nSimply explain your situation to everyone, then focus more on learning Spanish. Multiracial children who are not bilingual is a very common phenomenon.\n\nDon't concern yourself with the bullying and comments of others -- \"the lion cares not for the opinions of sheep.\" Live your own life. Dictating your future based on the reaction of others means they have full control over you. Don't let them.\n\nPart of dating someone with a different native language is coming to realize that the relationship benefits greatly from taking the time to study said language, even if it doesn't come easily to you.\n\nMost people struggle with learning their initial secondary language, so no need to worry so much about that.",

    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m not sure this is the right place to post this, but I don\u2019t know where else to start. I found a couple of journal entries in my boyfriend\u2019s (of 4 years) work papers. It seemed to be forgotten about, as it was under a stack of files. It was dated 06/06/22. Basically it was about 8 pages of just shitting on me. Lines that stood out: \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true, she is plain in a massive oasis of stunning beauty.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has neither the charm, nor the form that a man of my stature demands.\u201d \n\n\u201cShe is an anchor attached to my heel. Surely I would blossom if that burden were removed from my shoulders.\u201d\n\nFor reference, I didn\u2019t know he ever thought like this about me. He says it was a day we were fighting and he was angry. I am gathering that I am not pretty enough or \u201ccharming\u201d enough for him. Would you believe him that this was a fleeting day of anger and let it go, or does he truly think so lowly of me physically and emotionally? I know that I am conventionally attractive; I lift 4 days a week and I\u2019m very fit, I am tan and healthy and I have long dark hair, blue eyes, overall a pretty face. I make slightly more money than him, we have always been equal in bills, housework and cooking. I have a 6 year old son from my previous relationship who loves him very much, and who he loves as his own. Obviously you guys don\u2019t know my entire life, so you can\u2019t make huge assumptions or answer all of the questions that are swimming in my head right now, but I really want to know whether this is worth hanging onto or should I just take it for what he says and move on happily. I am sad and confused and just looking for a push in the right direction I suppose.",

Take care of yourself, snuggle up with your little boy, breathe. Once you've got over the initial hurt, you'll be in a better position to make a decision. Because I think the situation is composed of two parts, to be dealt with one after the other: first, the pain of finding out your partner sometimes has (or rather, once had!) ugly thoughts about you - and second, the possibility of a separation. This might feel like an emergency right now, but it actually isn't.",

I, personally, would never be able to feel that my partner thought I was beautiful/loved me if I read those things. I don't think I'd be able to move on from it. I understand that you have a son that loves him, but my advice here is that healthy, happy relationships involving separated adults are better for children that parents who are together and resentful.",

            "comment": "In any relationship there needs to be communication even when it gets uncomfortable. You two need to sit down and you need to ask him some hard questions. If it was written out of anger from fighting, then why did he hang on to the writing knowing there was a chance you could stumble upon it? Why were those his thoughts when he was angry from the fighting? What does he truly think about you? These are things you need to ask him and he needs to answer honestly. If he does mean the things he wrote he needs to man up and not continue on in this relationship especially where a child is concerned. \n\nYes, I have said things in the heat of the moment from anger to my boyfriend. I didn\u2019t know I was struggling with my mental health until we decided to take a break to get ourselves together. I\u2019ve done a lot of work through therapy and other appts. It\u2019s a night and day difference between my mentality then as opposed to now. But I never told him he was attractive or anything along those lines! \n\nHope you get things either figured out or move on!! Good luck op!!!",

It is def tough because like you asked how do we know that what they are telling us is sincere and honest or just the right words to shut us up to get over it and move on. You need to tell him that you have a child to protect. Him disrespecting you was way out of line and you refuse to be with someone who writes down things that are super hurtful to you. He needs to prove to you that you are everything he is looking for in a partner or if what he wrote really is how sees you. Set an example for you child than anything less than what they deserve won\u2019t be tolerated. \n\nI\u2019ve learned that for me personally, when I am upset or angry I need to text rather than talk face to face only because I\u2019m working really hard not to just blurt out whatever is in my head. My dad when he was alive would always tell me to watch my mouth and I would respond with \u201cI can\u2019t my nose is to big to see my mouth\u201d and that\u2019s because if it popped in my head it was def coming out of my mouth and sometimes I surprised even myself with what came out. Texting forces me to read what I\u2019m typing and trying to get across.\n\nTry to write down exactly what you felt when you found that and how much it upset you. Tell him finding that writing made you question him and his true feelings about you. Tell him for this relationship to work he needs to raw and honest. Tell him you don\u2019t want your time wasted or your child getting even more attached and hurt right along beside you. \n\nFeel free to dm me if you need to vent or need more advice. I can\u2019t promise I\u2019ll have the right advice but I do promise to try my best to help.",

I wrote things that were mean, because I didn't want to be with him, and I didn't know how to get out. \nI don't say this to sound hurtful, I say this to let you know that he probably means what he said, and that's not cool. You deserve so much more.\n\nAs someone else said, your child is young so the impact will be there, yes, but it won't be as bad as if you were to stay even longer. My son was 5 when we finally left my ex. He barely remembers anything about him.\n\nTake care of yourself. Don't second guess your gut. This guy might try to take you out of leaving. Just stay true to yourself. Do what you need to do. \n\nA helpful question to ask yourself might be what would you tell your son if his girlfriend wrote something like that about him? Or what would your son tell you to do if say he was older and he knew that your boyfriend wrote that about you?",

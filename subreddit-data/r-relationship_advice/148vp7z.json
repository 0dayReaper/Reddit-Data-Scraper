    "postText": "I am so confused and hurt over this. We met on bumble and just clicked. We talked and had a great time and then finally went on a date. Date went well so we planned a second date. The second date was just movies at her place and it went well as well. We cuddled had a good time and I made sure to not push any boundaries and let her know if i make her uncomfortable in any way. we made plans to have another but then the next day (today) I just get ghosted and blocked without explanation. I feel so stupid for getting attached and for why this happened. I hate having no closure. I feel like I'm living a movie with a cliffhanger that will never get a sequel. Any advice on how to feel better faster or just maybe suggestions as to why this happened. How should I proceed? Did i do something wrong? Thank you.\n\n\nUpdate: yeah so turns out she found out I may move to Florida and that possibility meant it was easier to cut me off now then get attached. I appreciate the advice.",

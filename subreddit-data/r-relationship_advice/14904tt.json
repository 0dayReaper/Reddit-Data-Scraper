    "postText": "My ex (21M) and me (21F) 'dated' throughout highschool and for another three years after until I finally got the courage to break up with him.  I say 'dated' because we never really went on real dates, besides hanging out at his house, in his room. (During highschool, the door was left open. After, we could close it if we wanted to.) \n\nHe wanted sex. I didn't. He was against women being able to choose for abortions, I wasn't. He didn't really believe the LGBTQIA+ but I fall under the flag as an Aro/Ace. And we also have a difference in beliefs. There are more differences that I can't really get past but those are the only ones I feel safe to put since I don't really know if he reads Reddit or not.\n\nI had wanted to split for a while, back during the first summer after we graduated but I'm a wuss. Around the time I finally got the courage to break up, he had gotten into an argument with a group of friends I'm apart of.\n\nHe's a conspiracy nut and read something online saying that gay men are more likely to molest children, or some crap like that. One of our friends in that group was (and still is) gay, and his sister was pregnant at the time. Another friend was gay and two more were bi. Well, crap hit the fan and I was stuck in the middle. This happened around last year, mid summer.\n\nI haven't blocked him yet, he doesn't really try to visit me at work or at home but he continues to text me, asking me to come back, telling me he loves me, accusing friend group of manipulating me into breaking up with him. And I don't know what to do. I haven't replied to any of his texts, I try not to read them but he still texts me over and over again.\n\nHis latest text was, and I quote, \"I love you. You were the only one to keep me sain through highschool. And there is nothing you could say or though (I think he ment think) to convince me those f*cks haven't manipulated you.\"\n\nI don't know what to do, and I've tried to explain it to him that it was my choice to break up, it was my decision. One of the brwking points was that he wanted sex, he was adamant about having sex. He wanted me to be his first.\n\nI didn't want it, and I've told him over and over again no. Not tonight. I don't want to, I'm not into it. He'd stop asking for a while, then when I stay the night, he'd ask again. He was cuddly, he wanted things I could give him. But he also has anger issues and they show whenever he gets into fights with his parents and older siblings. And he'd beilve his family over me.\n\nI don't know what to do to get the oint across that no, I don't want to date. Anyone. Period. So, reddit. Can you help?",

Go no contact and block him on everything.  Let people know that you have cut off contact.  If possible, change your number.\n\nIt's time to go nuclear.....hell, it was time to go nuclear a year ago!\n\nIt's both simple and complicated if you make it so.  Cut him out of your life.  The sooner the better.",

            "comment": "He's not listening to you or respecting your decision. His morals don't align with yours (you're in the right IMO). I'm surprised you've stuck it out this long. You don't owe him anything or an explanation. Cut him off because you clearly seem sure that things aren't going to work out nor are you in a position to change someone who isnt willingly open to change. Block him on everything, if he still tries to contact you it's just more red flags and you have the right to protect yourself with court orders or statements to the police if he is not respecting boundaries and won't leave you alone (obviously worst case scenario). Best case scenario is you never see him again. \n\nThis is easier said than done because you could still have an emotional attachment which is completely valid and normal. Find people in your life close to you who support you and you can begin focusing on what makes you happy. After a while you will probably feel the huge weight lifted off you.\n\nNote that everything I've mentioned depends entirely on your exact situation and the whole context. Either way you should find someone who truly repects you and respects boundaries and your morals.",

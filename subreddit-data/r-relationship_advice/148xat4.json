    "postText": "My ex and I were together for 2 years and split 4 months ago. He embarrassed me and was horrible to me at an important, formal event (there are more justifying details but keeping it vague for anonymity) so I ended it. I asked for a month minimum no contact. At the end of the month, he asked to meet up to have a conversation for closure. We had a conversation and he asked to reestablish contact with the hopes of getting back together. Note that I am in a very intense grad program and we were long distance. I was hesitant, but agreed given that he had made a lot of significant positive changes (the biggest being sobriety- his drinking definitely caused his behavior that caused us to break up). We began talking daily and it was very similar to when we were together. Since we didn\u2019t live in the same city, this was all via phone and text. I told him I couldn\u2019t meet up til the end of the semester because of exams and he seemed to be okay with that. \n\nAnyway, long story short he just moved to the city I\u2019m in for the summer (summer job). I was happy and thought maybe we would get back together officially. When he first moved up we hung out and slept together for the first time since we broke up. Now I find out he\u2019s dating other people. He even stayed with a girl while he was traveling this weekend. Technically he didn\u2019t do anything wrong- we were/are broken up. But I\u2019m heartbroken. He pitched this whole thing to me as him wanting to get back together so badly even though I told him it would take time and rebuilding trust.  He says he did nothing wrong because everything with us was so slow and we weren\u2019t together so he started dating casually. Now he doesn\u2019t know if he wants to be exclusive but still wants to be in contact with me. I told him either we\u2019re exclusive or I\u2019m completely out. If we decide not to get back together that\u2019s fine, it\u2019s over, but until that point I told him I didn\u2019t want him seeing anyone else. We are meeting later this week to discuss it more. \n\nI know this sounds stupid. I was so excited that he was moving here and the opportunity to try new things together. I\u2019m also really struggling in my new city and want so badly to lean on him, but it seems like a bad idea. I thought strangers might be able to give me some perspective. \n\nShould I cut contact with him? Any other advice?",

    "postText": "Early on in our relationship, my girlfriend had mentioned in passing about how she used to sleep with someone who had happened to be a drug dealer, not because she wanted drugs, but just because she wanted to sleep with him. Somehow the topic came up a few months later, and I had mentioned it would probably be a deal breaker if the person I'm dating had sold themselves in exchange for drugs, I don't have a problem with sex workers, but in a relationship, I would just get the ick if I had learned someone commodified their bodies especially for a little bit of weed.\r  \n\r  \nWhile we we're drinking, she had mentioned that she had used to sleep with her drug dealer in exchange for weed. This is different from how she first told the story and explained that she didn't tell it all to me because she was afraid, that I would have broken up with her. I don't know if that part is a deal breaker still, it did gross me out in that moment, but I know she was manic during that time. I'm more so bothered that she felt like she couldn't trust me to tell me the whole story from the beginning, if so, why even bring it up, I haven't pestered her for this information.\r  \n\r  \nShe's been a great girlfriend, and our relationship has been really strong up to this point, but this is the first moment where I feel a little unsafe in our relationship. When she went to buy weed a month ago with her roommate, she had told me she had gotten a lot of free stuff because her and her roommate are hot, she showed me and it was easily $100 of free stuff. I'm not sure if my feelings are valid, I don't know if I feel insecure, but more so unsure of our future. What would you guys do if the person you were dating had withheld information out of fear of separation?\r  \n\r  \ntldr my girlfriend was drunk and revealed more about her past that she had kept hidden",

They are not Salvationists, they are business men/women that are dealing with high risk good.\nThere is nothing that ever will be free, this free stuff is potentially paid in other ways.\n\n\nEven if your girlfriend is ashamed of how she acted in the past it very much sounds to me that she has not changed her ways.",

To forgive is divine. But, it sounds like you fear that she is currently selling herself. The idea that she would prostitute herself for $100 of marijuana swag doesn't seem likely. But, then again, if she sold herself for a bag of weed...  \n\n\nIt sounds like you are a more conservative person than your girlfriend. You may want to keep looking.",

Since we have been having consistent sex like 2x a day since our first date, and despite this new information I do trust her. She never buys alone, and doesn\u2019t even have contact for a dealer she always does it through me or her with her roommate.\n\nI\u2019ll talk to her about this and go from there, but I definitely need to communicate both our expectations in this relationship. I can understand why she withheld this information, I wouldn\u2019t want this to be a consistent thing. \n\nI\u2019ve been stuck on this for the past day, and I think your comment really centered me. Thank you",

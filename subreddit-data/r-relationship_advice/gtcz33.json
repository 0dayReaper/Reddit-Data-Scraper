    "postText": "My boyfriend and I have been together 10 months. He lives with his parents (50s M+F) and younger brothers (10, 16, 18), no sisters. Before current events he was over my place basically every night. A couple nights ago he said that he wants to move in with me, if I'm up for it.\n\nI've been to his place more than once, and I've seen how their dynamic works. His mother does everything for all 5 men in that house. Cooking, cleaning, the works. Basically all they have to do is put their laundry away after she washes/dries/irons/folds it. The reason the parents aren't forcing them to contribute is that this was the parent's agreement. He works, she's a stay at home, so she raises the kids/runs the household and he pays for everything, with one of the clauses being that as she's doing everything there's no need to involve the boys.\n\nAs a result, my boyfriend cannot do anything. I don't know how much of this is actual cluelessness and how much is him trying to get out of stuff, but he has told me, completely sincere (and I checked this with his mother), that he can't even fry an egg. Which is why, when my boyfriend suggested moving in together, I said I wanted him to live alone first.\n\nHis plan was basically to go straight from his mother's house to my flat. I told him my hesitation, which is that he can't do chores. He then offered to pay more rent (75%) in exchange for me doing all the chores. I said no. I don't want to be his mother, or his maid, I want to be his girlfriend.\n\nThen I told him I wanted him to live alone. Go from his mothers house to his own place, figure out how to do all the things he's never done for himself, learn some basic life skills, and then revisit us living together.\n\nThis has caused a HUGE argument, biggest we've ever had. He's taken me saying he has no life skills as an insult, which it kind of was to be fair, and has basically said that clearly I don't want to live with him at all as I've pushed the moving in time back and have only said we'd \"revisit\" after a few months of him living alone, and I did say \"revisit\" because I wanted to make sure he actually knew what he was doing and wouldn't immediately switch back to offering more rent for no chores.\n\nThis was all a couple nights ago and he's just stopped talking to me. He's at his mum's, he's online, he's talking to mutual friends who have said he is responding, he just won't answer any of my calls/texts. He's told our friends what happened and they're all on his side, saying I was really mean/cruel. I love him, and I do want to live with him eventually, I just don't want to live with him if I'm doing everything, and the one thing I don't want is him paying extra for me to do all the housework.\n\nIs there some sort of compromise, or some option I'm not seeing? What can I do to fix this?\n\nTL;DR: Boyfriend is incapable of doing any household chores. He wants to move in together. I don't want to be his maid. We can't find a compromise and I would love any suggestions.\n\nUpdate: he called me and agreed to talk. He then basically said that he was never going to be willing to learn to do anything, and even suggested dividing up the chores then I do my half and he hire a maid to do his half. Suffice to say this was something of a turn off and by the end of the conversation we broke up.",

I've done that twice and came to realize eventually I'm not actually in love with them. You move in with someone when you're absolutely sure you love them. When you know everything about them. When you have good communication.\n\nIf you move in with a partner because it's convenient, especially when you're young, you can feel trapped if the relationship starts to end. You're locked in a lease, stuck sharing a bed with someone you might not like/love, you grow to resent them. Or maybe you do actually love them, I can't speak for you two, but I definitely wouldn't be able to even respect someone that couldn't do their own damn laundry.\n\nAnother reason not to move in with your bf is yes he definitely needs to grow the fuck up. He needs to learn life skills like you said, AND the fact he blew up on you for pointing that out shows he needs to mature a ton before he moves in with a girlfriend.",

Things like budgeting, organising bills, learning to balance nights out and friends with having to stay in and clean the place, unclog toilets, the list goes on.\n\nIf he\u2019s already making excuses and trying to pay you to become his maid, I\u2019ll bet every penny on him not even trying to help with anything and leaving it until it annoys you so much you do it all yourself.\n\nHe needs to grow up big time and realise there\u2019s so much more to learn in life. You think you have it all figured out until life slaps you in the face with not enough money for rent.",

One time I got home exhausted, he had just woken up from a nap and was \"grumpy\" from sleeping too long. I decided to just cook because I knew he wasn't going to and ended up passing out and falling on the floor from low blood sugar. He came in and picked me up and said \"it's ok, I can wait for dinner\". \n\nThat's not even the most ridiculous or entitled asshole thing he ever did or said to me by far. \n\nI do not miss that man (boy) even a little bit.",

The fact is being unwilling or unable to work through problems or recognize them as real is another HUGE red flag all on its own and it's something that will crop up forever, in everything, for the rest of your life. If someone genuinely cannot work through problems, they are not someone who will survive the ups and downs of life. Your relationship will crack before it even sails. It's like using a broken life vest. It never works when it needs to. It's a moot point to have a relationship with this kind of person.\n\nOP I urge you to only stay with him if he is willing to recognize and change this highly selfish and immature quality about himself. He sounds like someone who makes his insecurities about everyone else, and refuses to improve himself or take any responsibility for his life. Do not tolerate this because it WILL destroy any future you're planning to have with him. Think about talking this over with him, and if he seems absolutely unwilling to think about it or unresponsive to any concept of change or criticism, then I recommend you dump him. Obviously you don't have to spend that kind of emotional labor pointing it out to him in the first place and teaching him about how it's unfair to do this to his loved ones. If you do decide to expend the energy, and it becomes clear that he won't even entertain the idea of changing/improving himself, then it should be clear that you'll be hearing the burden of all the emotional work and likely physical work in this relationship, unlikely to ever have your feelings heard if he doesn't agree with them (as he is demonstrating now). That includes your needs as well, such as needing an equal partner and needing to be sure of it before moving in together. It sounds like his first response is anger and then pouting and then punishing/complaining to other people about it. Basically, avoiding any kind of solution and only using anger instead of compassion when it comes to your partnership needs. I would not sign up for a lifetime of emotional labor that would go unpaid and unreciprocated. The whole point of a relationship is supposed to be mutual emotional work. It sounds like he wouldn't even make the cut into a physically supportive relationship. And it sounds like he doesn't see the problem with that. It's up to you what you want to live with. Just be aware what your future might look like with this guy-- although from the sound of it, you already are, and are also likely very independent, cognizant, intelligent, and emotionally aware.

I was feeling sad that my ex/formerly good friend blocked me a couple days ago, but you summed up my feelings towards the relationship/friendship I had with him for like six years in a clear, succinct manner. You really hit the nail on the head; thank you for reminding me that even if it's hard to lose someone I loved for many years, I'd have just kept painfully suffering if I was still with him. If anything, I'm glad he showed me who he really was before he managed to get me to marry him. He was close, but I had a sudden realization that he just wasn't going to change, and I was signing up for treading on eggshells and being mommy 2.0 with benefits for him 24/7.\n\n\n\nIn his defense, I also made a lot of mistakes, but when they were pointed out, I apologized, I talked it out with him, and I did my best to not do those things. When I messed up again, I'd quickly apologize, again talk about it with him, and I'd think about why it happened and what I could do to prevent it from happening again. Meanwhile, when he was faced with criticism, he basically would ignore me until I was so anxious I was crying and dismissing my own feelings to basically beg him to come back. I'd profusely apologize for having dared to say anything less than lovely to him, and I'd basically beg him to forgive me. He would, and I'd end up praising him out the ass for it. That shit fucked me up. I mentioned how much that messed with me to him two days ago, along with other very blunt, negative things, and poof, blocked, because \"I showed him what I really thought of him when he was thinking of me daily and had wanted to always be together\". I felt like shit, and I apologized, and I got no response. Your comment really solidified why I lost nothing of value, and it oddly helped me feel better.",

Good on you for standing your ground, OP, and at that point I wouldn\u2019t even waste my time arguing. You\u2018ll be miserable moving in with that guy at *any* point in his life even if he decides to live alone for a while to appease you - because then he\u2018ll just revert to his current form once he has you trapped living with him. How I know? It\u2018s clear he doesn\u2018t want to do the cleaning up, *ever*, else he would have offered to learn it himself *right now* instead of offered to pay (which tbh is more than most dudes like him do). \n\nDo not move in with this dude. I\u2018d argue it\u2018s actually good that things got tense now, because you were vigilant enough to notice *before* he moved in. It would have become an issue the instant he moved in anyway, but it would be much harder to drop him like a hot potato and get you a dude who\u2018s worth your time. I know you like him a lot, but he showed you a big part of his character here and that\u2018s neither on you to fix nor on you to take over for him. It\u2019s also not fixable because he actually likes it to be that way and would rather pay than learn and put in the work himself. There are better dudes out there who\u2019ll treat you great, love you AND not expect you to mommy them and clean after them.\n\nIf I can be an entirely self sufficient PhD living off her own money and cleaning her own stuff, so can men. You\u2018re not in this world to clean after Mr. Can\u2019t-even-feed-himself.\n\nHow\u2018s that supposed to go in the case you want to raise children? Will you do all of the housework, all of the child rearing and all of the emergencies because dude can\u2018t be left alone with a toddler because he can\u2019t change diapers and can\u2019t fry a damn egg even? \n\nEven without proper children:Why would you want to have a lazy child as a partner? People who live in a household have to pull their weight as good as they can. This dude can do better but refuses to. That\u2018s infuriating.\n\n\nIn that same vein: how is that supposed to go when you become seriously ill one day? My best bet: he will leave you for another fuckable housemaid, as soon as you require care, care he\u2019s not willing to give as it doesn\u2018t center or benefit him - as do [21% of men as opposed to only 4% of women.](https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.24577).\n\nThere is no excuse for him not starting to learn (and eagerly and willingly so) right this hot second. It is, however, a very good glimpse into your prospective future with him.\n\nAnd then I haven\u2019t even touched his pouting and silent treatment as an attempt of emotional manipulation.

And I do wonder if they had any daughters, would the daughters get out of any chores? My mum was stay-at-home, too, and so did the bulk of the housework.

OP, you shouldn't feel guilty for wanting him to be a functional adult, and having boundaries and expectations. You aren't looking to adopt a grown-ass man, you're looking for a partner.

He made the money though... when his mom died, he only knew how to go to work and make the money. When we had children, he never once changed a diaper. When I bought the house, his name wasn\u2019t on it. When he came home from work, I did his laundry cause he didn\u2019t know how. I did the dishes, I cooked, I cleaned (and then got bitched at if things weren\u2019t clean enough - OR!! If I moved something of his that he now couldn\u2019t find.) I took off the trash (we lived out of district for trash pickup and would have to pay extra for trash pickup - which he didn\u2019t want to spend the money on, but he never took it off because \u201cthe dump is only open when I\u2019m at work..\u201d) I mowed the 1 acre we lived on. I took the dogs (he wanted) to the vet for regular checkups. I paid all the bills (with his money) and arranged the shopping. I raised the kids and then when I left him - he took them from me.... why? Cause he made the money. He made me quit my job when his mom died cause \u201cwe had no one to watch our kids and he didn\u2019t want a stranger doing it.\u201d That was in 2010. I left in 2014. \n\nJust ... be careful. Maybe your guy is capable of learning and will put an effort into it. My ex-husband was a whole other level of horrible - but he certainly always used the excuse that he didn\u2019t know how.",

His reaction is the problem. \n\nMy husband could do a lot when we met but it was mostly electrical or \u2018fix it\u2019 stuff. When we moved in together I showed him how to schedule chores, clean efficiently, and stay on top of small things that add up to keep life running smoothly (like doing a nightly 10 minute tidy before bed or putting every dish in the dishwasher as it\u2019s used). He never bitched or acted like I was attacking him. He enthusiastically participated in household activities and took advice with grace. Now we have a really great relationship because our expectations of housekeeping are aligned and we don\u2019t have to have things like assigned chores or charts that make you feel like you have adult children.",

Either he has mental issues that seriously  need to be addressed or he's a straight up liar. I think you know what he is. Anybody who's watched someone else do something can eventually replicate it to some extent.\n\nWhy are you wasting your time with this person? He comes from a family where the dynamics are the wife stays at home and does all the chores and that's it. That is exactly the kind of lifestyle this guy wants and you know it. Are you really willing to give up your job and lively hood to be a stay at home mother to a husband that's a stereotypical father from the early 1900 and below? If you think you are, I'd tell you to read stories about financial abuse before you allow him to move in. That might just save you from a lifetime of misery because many women who agree to that kind of agreement don't even realize what financial abuse is. And don't try to pretend that he's not going to ask you to quit your job. He will. If he doesn't, then you can expect to have the same agreement of doing all the chores while also working you butt off to support your children and the man child you married.\n\n\nIf you're doing fine by yourself then break up with this guy. He is going to bring you nothing but a slow burning misery while twists your thoughts against you in an attempt to manipulate you. It is not you job to try and change someone who isn't going to change. He is a 24 year old who refuses to learn any life skills and is nowhere near to being independent in any way, shape, or form. You are the exact opposite. You don't have a boyfriend, you have a man child who's a leech.",

That would have been my very first question if I were in the BF's shoes.  I think a partner should ideally be available to help teach their partner various things whenever the situation calls for it but the partner lacking the knowledge should first be willing to learn.  Looks like this dude is not willing to learn at all.  That's a pretty bad sign.\n\nBut I assume there are plenty of women out there who would be willing to take the role of the mom/housekeeper so not like he doesn't have options.  I know in my culture that many women still are willing to play this role to entitled and incompetent men.",

Half full glasses/cans, dirty dishes and garbage litter every surface. The toilet has shit on the back of the seat and the floor around the toilet has been pissed on and the toilet paper roll is empty. The sink is full of dirty dishes, the garbage is full. The kitchen counter has sugar all over it. Your boyfriend is watching tv or playing video games, completely oblivious to the disaster he's created. He sees you and asks what you want to do for dinner, meaning, what are you cooking? You get angry at him and ask him to help you clean up his mess. One of two things happens. 1. He storms out and goes to hangout with his friends. Or 2. He's angry that you want him to do something he doesn't want to do and barely, begrudgingly brings you a few dishes to wash. You have to argue with him to get the rest of the dishes. Eventually, you make dinner and then you clean up, alone, while he goes back to what he was doing before. After working all day, you've done an additional 3 hours of labor cleaning up after a grown ass man. You remember how clean your place was when you were single and how much easier your life was. You kind of hate him. You don't want to hang out with him, talk to him or have sex with him. You just want to shower and go to bed. But there's piss in the shower and crumbs in the bed, pizza grease on the sheets. He doesn't understand why you're mad, accuses you of over reacting and accuses you of treating him like a child or slave, depending on the day. Some version of this is going to be a day in your life if you move in with this guy. Don't do it. Leave him to his mother.",

This is not a fight you will win. \n\nYou are young, 10 months in grand scheme of things is nothing. I say let this one go.",

Instead you were looking for a real and healthy compromise.\n\nHe decided to feel attacked. It reeks of DARVO, deny - attack - reverse victim and offender.\nIt's a very effective manipulation tactic. You bring up a reasonable argument, but now he has you doubting yourself. It's not my fault, it's your fault!  That's a very unhealthy dynamic that needs to stop. If he can't do that, then you always have to protect yourself by removing yourself from that situation.\n\nPeople that are not open to introspection, communication and compromise make very difficult partners.\n\nRunning a household later, especially with young kids in the mix, can be really taxing and it really helps if you and your partner can both work on things that need to be done and work as a team.\n\nLife will also happen. My wife was really ill the past 2 years. That means I have to pick up the slack, which I do lovingly. When I was down for a period before that, she helped me without complaint. Would your boyfriend do the same?",

Let your mom take care of you for the rest of your life or learn to be a man instead of a child. Whoever is going to be your caretaker for the rest of your life, it sure as hell won't be me.\"\n\nThis post is seriously upsetting, and I'd have sent that text above as soon as he'd gotten his friends involved in harassing you over his tantrum. What kind of adult man would think that peer pressuring and bullying his girlfriend into being his sexy maid is a good idea? When functional adult couples have a problem, they solve it together - your bf has displayed clearly that he won't be doing even that. You've offered a compromise, and offered advice on how he can learn these crucial life skills, but he seems like he isnt unable to learn but unwilling to learn. So unwilling that he won't even do it for the woman he supposedly loves? Nah girl. This is one baby I'd be totally fine with dropping.",

He needs to learn how to be an adult \u2014 and you DO NOT have to teach him. It\u2019s NOT your responsibility as a girlfriend to teach him how to fry an egg, how to do laundry, how to clean the bathtub...he knows zero and will contribute zero.\n\nIf you brought up your concerns and he was willing to learn, that would be one thing. The fact that his *first* response was \u201coh, I\u2019ll pay more rent and you\u2019ll do all the chores\u201d is total bullshit. I would respect myself way too much to even date this guy.",

And the fact that he seems to take any kind of criticism, any acknowledgement of his lack of skill, any hint of dissatisfaction from you, as you being \"mean\" and \"attacking him\" is a huge red flag. That's not what being a good partner is about.\n\nTell his friends that they're free to do all his housework if that sounds like such a great deal to them, but you're not going to be his maid and you're not mean for not wanting to be his maid.",

    "postText": "It was late and we were walking about the park. I went to the Restroom. I come back and some jackoff is sexually harassing with my g/f. Shes very uncomfortable (doing her best not to panic)and lets him know so and that her boyfriend is nearby. He's not listening. I approach him and kindly tell him to fuck off or I'll call the Police. Dude is very clearly drunk as I can smell the beer on him. As we turn to leave he grabs her ass and tells her to leave me and come to him. I turn around and hit him. My girlfriend has been a victim of sexual assault before and she's doing her best not to breakdown. I'll spare you the details other then I got my ass kicked. He left after that. My girlfriend had a panic attack in the car after that. \n\nI just feel letdown I couldn't help her.  I feel embarrassed, emasculated. Shes been a victim of sexual assault before so this harassment is traumatic. I wasn't able to hep her. I wasn't there for her. I feel worthless. I could have held it in, I could have just left earlier like she wanted. its been two days and she's still traumatized over it. She has an emergency therapy meeting today and hasn't been to work. Shes been crying and I've attempted to help her but, it's clear I can't.",

That guy is definitely a scumbag but I\u2019m glad you were there (even if you got beat up) cause he most likely would\u2019ve done a lot worse to her if she was all alone. The event definitely brought back horrible memories for her, and I\u2019m so happy she\u2019s in therapy. My advice is to just be there for her and emotionally support her as well. You saved her that night now be there for her now.",

It sounds like getting beat up is a price you would have been happy to pay to save your gf so stop seeing that as a failure. You succeeded in saving her AND you got your ass kicked, what's the problem, mission accomplished.\n\nVery badass, I must say. You can't be phisically stronger than everyone but you can be the kind of guy to save someone at the cost of taking a beating.",

I was all alone in my situation. I had to have a really long think about how I would feel if I were your gf. Obviously you feel maybe weak or emasculated by the fact you got your ass beat. And I spent quite some time trying to imagine the events in your post. Everyone is different as well... but the fact you tried is what rings out to me. It doesn't matter about winning or losing the fight exactly... Did you distract and deter him? Yes. Was anyone killed, or harmed physically to a point of disability? No? Then it was a success. A fucking success. You DID WIN. That skid-mark of a bully didn't get what he wanted. He also had the perk of being drunk - this makes him less inhibited and less likely to physically restrain himself. You sound like a kind caring person - any normal person couldn't respond and ramp up fast enough in the face of that aggression unless they were a trained individual. *Are you a trained individual?*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn truth you learned a hard lesson - it's not worth the aggravation if you can try de-escalate. What he did was wrong. But provoking an aggressive and mentally impaired person is NOT a wise choice. You are both lucky to come away with your lives. Imagine if he had a knife. I cannot blame you for reacting as you did and just hope that maybe you and your gf can take some self-defence classes. It's not just about the physical but the mental approach to combat and de-escalation techniques. IT IS NEVER WORTH RISKING YOUR LIFE UNLESS YOUR LIFE IS AT RISK.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut you tried. I cannot blame you. Not everyone can win but I feel that what happened was as good a result as you could hope for. He did fuck off in the end, yes? To have my lover, my partner, my friend STAY BY ME in such a volatile situation... it's a comfort. It's hot. I'd feel less alone. No matter the outcome to have someone so special consider ME that special, worth so much they put themselves in the line of fire... you  won my dude. The other asshole... what did he get exactly? You both will likely need some help processing this especially your gf. But do not beat yourself up around her. **Would you do it all over again if history repeated, knowing that your gf will be kept safe but that you would get your ass handed to you?** Remember the asshole got nothing. You have your lives, your relationship, your love for one another. Your partnership. Some people would have frozen or run away. You already did a shit ton more than most.",

If you had ignored him, he might have become more violent. There is NO way to tell whether the situation would have turned out for the better if you'd done anything different.\n\nAll victims get these \"what ifs\". It's you trying to fix a problem that cannot be fixed, since it's in the past. You can't change the past, but you can change how you feel about it NOW.\n\nGetting your ass kicked isn't the end of the world. It feels humiliating, and I can understand that you feel inadequate, but if you'd beaten him up your girlfriend would still feel the same. She probably thinks that you are her hero because you defended her. You stood up for her, and you were even willing to fight for her. You cannot comprehend how much that means for victims. It doesn't matter to her that you \"lost\" the fight, you were willing to start it.\n\nDrunk guys also have incredible strenght. There's a reason why my hospital's ER makes sure all the drunks are escorted by security and restraints are nearby - these guys can overpower you way easier than you'd think. You are not inadequate for getting beaten.\n\nI suggest you take some therapy sessions too. It might help you change how you feel about the past (remember: you can't change the past, only how you feel about it!). Maybe it's a good idea to take a self defense class with your girlfriend? I found that that upped my self-esteem and confidence A LOT, even when I don't technically have to defend myself.\n\nDon't blame yourself. You did everything you could, and I think you're her hero right now, even if she doesn't tell you.",

Because that's the energy that you will need to support her moving forward.\n\nIf you feel psychological trauma from it, it's possible that some MMA training will flush it out of you. \n\nAnd remember one thing: every human on the planet can lose a fight. Even martial arts champions. There is ALWAYS someone better than you out there so that's why there is no great shame in losing.\n\nAnd the best revenge is living a good life.

She may be feeling weak herself because you had to step in and it got you beat up. \n\nMake sure she isn\u2019t feeling bad for you and let her know you would do it again because her well-being is worth it.

Yes it seems manly and chivalrous to try to confront the douchebag in this situation, but at what cost? If it's some random guy, there is probably close to a 50/50 chance the fight won't go your way and what if that only makes the guy escalate even more.

You don\u2019t say if your girlfriend appreciate you defending her, it\u2019s not important that you won the fight only that you protected her which you did.\n\nThe fact that she has more trauma from this is unfortunate but you didn\u2019t accost her, nor did you do ANY of the PAST things that she is upset about. \n\nHer sister is stupid. She is obviously a negative person and maybe is upset because your girlfriend has been triggered but the fact is that you are the one who had violence committed on you. Your girlfriend is fine and what she\u2019s upset about is how this triggered her and she will need to deal with that. \n\nObviously had you known she would be accosted you would\u2019ve gone home earlier or held your bladder. But that doesn\u2019t make you responsible because in every interaction you didn\u2019t for see some random negative consequence and decided to relieve yourself.\n\nTake a deep breath. Take a step back. Don\u2019t listen to or respond to her sister. Check in with your girlfriend. Get some therapy. \n\nRegardless of your girlfriends issues, if you can\u2019t be supported in this environment and you need to go someplace where you were safe. You didn\u2019t break her and it\u2019s not solely your responsibility to fix her. And hopefully she can appreciate that and support you also and if she can\u2019t you\u2019re not in a good relationship. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t reserve the right to be the only person with feelings or in need of love or support.\n\nTake a look at this [Healthy Relationship Spectrum](https://www.thehotline.org/healthy-relationships/relationship-spectrum/) and see how your relationship compares to an ideal relationship.",

You are both victims and it will be a lot to process. \n\nMy advice is to try an be as open with your girlfriend as you can. Seek out therapy if you feel like it would help. It did for me. Try to remember that you are in this together. You did the right thing.",

Fighting is so much about luck. You can hit someone just right and not do much damage but if they were a quarter inch closer or farther away it might have knocked them out.\n\nPlus if the other guy was drunk, he wouldn't feel much. And if he hassles women regularly he may be used to defending himself. You stepped in and defended her. In an ideal situation she would have ran for the car or help.\n\nLosing a fight sucks and it does make you question your manhood. You know what's worse, if you had done nothing and walked away. Then you would feel like a coward. \n\nyour girlfriend is upset about the guy hassling her not the fact that you lost a fight.\n\nI will give you a boxing example of why you shouldn't be hard on yourself. I'm sure you've heard of Mike Tyson one of the best heavyweight fighters ever. Have you heard of James Buster Douglas? Maybe not. Obviously Tyson was the better fighter but not on one night in japan when Douglas beat him. Anything can happen in fights the better fighter doesn't always win . And sometimes a good guy loses to an a-hole while trying to do the good and honorable thing of protecting his girlfriend.\n\nTry to forget the fight and go comfort your girlfriend. better days ahead!",

You should 100% pay for additional training)  puts you in a different mindset when it comes to self defense.  IMO, you should have never hit the dude escalating the situation.  Easier said than done, I know.  You walk away, create space if he's not going away, and call the cops. If the dude comes at you or your gf, then respond with appropriate force.  He says he's gonna beat the shit outta you, kill you, pulls out a deadly weapon, you respond with equal force.  Your gun.  \n\nIt basically makes you a bitch when it comes to fights because you don't want to introduce a firearm into the situation unless your hand is forced, then all bets are off and you fight/shoot to win.  \n\nJust don't be that guy who thinks he can get into and win any fight bc he has a gun.

But there is a strong chance she may not feel like you can keep her safe after this, and it may cause problems in your relationship or even end it. Biologically seeing someone attempt to defend you and lose, you don\u2019t really trust them to defend you after that. I hope that isn\u2019t the case and I\u2019m sure she knows you tried, but it\u2019s a natural response to seeing the person you trust to be there for you lose a fight to someone who was harassing her. In that situation, after you were down what stopped the guy from going after your gf again? The choice was left to the man who won that fight, and she knows this. She felt like she was in more danger after the fight than before it, understandably so. From the history you\u2019ve provided, protection is something that is very likely extremely significant to her. When that\u2019s taken away from her she just won\u2019t feel safe. That\u2019s not to say she won\u2019t love you anymore or something. It\u2019s just that you may need to find a way to prove you can defend her in the future. \n\nAgain, I think you did the right thing regardless. We can\u2019t win them all, but you deserve a lot of respect for standing up for her like that.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m sorry, but if you hit him first and then lost it\u2019s not going to help your case in her head. If you started the fight and then lost it, then there\u2019s an extra layer to the insecurity she will feel, because she may feel like you escalated it and pissed off the aggressor more, putting her at more risk. You\u2019re at a critical point in your relationship right now, I\u2019d say try to get physically stronger because that may ease her insecurity if she sees it.",

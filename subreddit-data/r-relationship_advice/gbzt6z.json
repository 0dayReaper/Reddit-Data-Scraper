First of all, I'd like to thank each and every one of you for your help. I'm really grateful for the support I've received here and all those little messages some of you sent me really made me understand the situation I was in. The many MANY comments I read here gave me the strength I needed to talk to my sister. Thank you, guys.\n\nI should probably tell you that this might not be the perfect badass ending you all were expecting, and I apologize for that. I've always had a hard time standing up against my sister. Like I said in my original post, my boyfriend doesn't like confrontations either and he's also a huge people pleaser which makes this situation harder for both of us.  \n\nNevertheless, I finally decided to talk to my sister yesterday. She was actually sitting in my living room in her underwear and bra, and I completely lost my shit. I told her multiple times to wear some clothes but she said it was too hot which it was not. She then made a small comment about me being insecure about my bf liking her or something like that, and that made me angry.\n\nI sat her down and we talked. I told her she was making me uncomfortable. She was making my boyfriend uncomfortable, and we wanted her to leave. She looked very shocked by it because I don't think I have ever talked to her like that. She immediately apologized though. She said she didn't know or some bullshit which I wasn't going to fall for this time.\n\nI gave her an ultimatum. She needed to pack her shit and get out in three hours. She looked very emotional and she apologized a lot, said \"sorry\" a lot and told me she loved me. She said she would never intentionally try to hurt me. If I \"misunderstood\" her actions, it wasn't her fault. She kept saying she didn't know. She said she was just trying to be \"friendly\" to my boyfriend which is not true at all. \n\nI asked her if sexually harrassing someone was \"friendly\" to her, and she started crying. By this time, my bf who was in our bedroom (avoiding my sister and her skimpy clothing) came to support me. She kind of directed her questions towards him. She asked him if she was making him uncomfortable (He said yes) and she cried and apologized. She then tried to gain his sympathy by saying that I was kicking her out when she had no place to go. She also lied that I was always mean to her. She completely ignored me and asked him if she could stay. She had nowhere else to go.\n\nOf course he said no. What the fuck did she think. I will forever remember the look on her face.\n\nSo yeah, she actually refused to leave, cried a lot and said she was jobless and she didn't have money, no place to stay, no friends etc. I told her she had no friends because she was a bitch (the first time I said something like this to my sister) She then tried to guilt trip me to let her stay by repeating the words \"I'm your sister\" \"family\" \"I love you\" etc. Me and my boyfriend helped her pack all her stuff and put it next to her car. I told her that she can stay in her car, I didn't care. I wanted her to go.\n\nIt wasn't really \"epic\" like some of you wanted. I was actually crying a little while I was shouting at her because I was shaking so much. At one point my bf had to tell me to calm down. It was just so overwhelming. I'm just glad she's gone.\n\nShe did leave eventually. She was calling someone and I'm pretty sure she went back to her own flat. Thank god she's not going to my parents because I don't think she knows how to quarantine. I know she won't quarantine and this was the main reason I was hesitant to kick her out.\n\n2-3 hours after she left, my mom called me and yelled at me for kicking her out. I shouldn't have been shocked when she accused my bf of bothering my sister. My mom also asked me what kind of man I was dating, I should leave him etc. I should've expected that, really. I tried to reason with her but my mom was just angry at me. She asked me things like \"how can you do this to your own sister\" and similar bullshit she should be asking my sister. At that point I was so fucking angry. I was in tears and shaking. I just told her to fuck off in anger and hung up.\n\nIt was just a weird day. I'm proud of myself for finally standing up to my sister, but I also don't really feel like getting up from my bed. My bf is back to his cheerful self and I'm happy about that, but I just feel like such an idiot. I should've realized my mom would never take my side a long time ago.\n\nI just don't understand what I did to make my mom so angry at me. Why doesn't she love me? I have done everything she asked me to do, but she never takes my side in things. I just want her to fucking love me and support me for once. It just never happens and I feel like I'm a fucking idiot for even trying. I think she regrets I was even born. \n\nAnyway fuck that. I'm done trying to reason with them. My mom will never believe me. Pretty sure my sister lied to her so mom keeps calling and trying to speak to my bf.\n\nI'm currently thinking of cutting off all of my family. All they do is make me feel like shit. I deserve better than that. My boyfriend deserves better than that\n\nI apologize for venting. What's done is done. I don't regret it. I'm glad I have my boyfriend and he loves me unlike my family and we finally have some alone time. He's been so moody, but right now he's actually cooking and stuff and he hasn't done that ever since sister came here so yeah. I'm glad she's gone. My boyfriend is glad she's gone. I finally have some peace and quiet in my home.  \n\nThank you so much to everyone. I don't think I can thank you all enough. Some of you talked to me, sent me messages and it really opened my eyes. I'll take care of myself and my boyfriend now. Thank you :)\n\nEdit: thank you everyone. I've been reading your comments. I'm still shocked by the support I've received here. Please know that I appreciate it so much, even though I may not be able to reply. Thank you.",

There are also some good subs like r/justnofamily and r/raisedbynarcissists with people who have been through the pain you are experiencing and can help with advice.

I\u2019m sorry that you feel she doesn\u2019t love you. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not true. She just had a weird bias to your sister. But it must suck for it to be so obvious. Take your time in bed and be gentle with yourself as you process that. \n\nTry to reflect on the good of this situation, someone im was treating you badly and you stuck up for yourself in a calm and mature way. Keep doing that and you\u2019ll go far in life and find yourself surrounded by good people.\n\nGood luck with everything!",

I miss her terribly, we had some really great times and were close for most of our adult lives, but she really hurt and betrayed me. Luckily, I have all the texts she sent me and even a letter she sent me while she was being awful, so any time I think I miss her, I remember who she really is and why I could never have a relationship with her again. \n\nAlso, remember that your mother immediately took her side, didn't even ask for your version of the events, and immediately attacked your boyfriend. These people don't actually care about you, they simply want to use you. It's extremely sad and hard to come to terms with, but it's the truth. Please don't allow them to worm their way back into your life. Don't even consider apologising to any of them (an extremely hard thing to stop yourself from doing when you've been trained to your whole life). None of this was your fault or your doing. Your sister thought she could walk all over you and you would never do a thing about it because that's what she's been doing your whole life. You've stood up for yourself now, so please don't let them manipulate you into thinking it was your fault or that you should apologise. One last thing, also do not let them rug sweep this. Don't let them pretend this didn't happen. They should both be apologising to you, so if they contact you again, that should be the first thing out of their mouths or you hang up/shut the door/walk away.",

Nothing, so shell try to tear you down. Don't be afraid to ask your bf for help. He doesn't like confrontation but he will support you at tough times.\n\nGood luck. Times heals things best.",

Maybe even consider therapy, it'll help you with the future stuff in your family which is bound to happen.\n\nOverall, you've done the right thing, even if your family won't understand. Even if they will paint you black and your sis will smear you with lies. Take confidence in that, and never forget that.",

Then when someone sensible tries to bring some normality to the situation they lash out because they usually don\u2019t want to have to face how insane they\u2019ve all been behaving. Your mum lashed out at you because facing your sisters behaviour now means facing allll of your sisters behaviour and I doubt she can do that. By any sane persons normal meter she shouldn\u2019t have done that and should absolutely side with you over the sexual harasser but I\u2019m willing to bet that she\u2019s been excusing her shit for so long that this doesn\u2019t even seem that bad to her and SHE makes excuses for you sister so why can\u2019t you because she\u2019s faaamily.\n\nWell done for not caving to that shit and standing up for your boyfriend, kicking your sister out was the most loving thing you could have done for him. I\u2019m honestly really sorry your mum screamed at you, my grandmother behaves in the exact same way and it\u2019s awful to have a family member that\u2019s angry at you when you\u2019ve done nothing wrong and I don\u2019t know your sister or your mum, maybe there\u2019s a chance you could reason with them, maybe there\u2019s not but my advice as someone who\u2019s survived a few big family blow outs is that they\u2019re not always worth it. Sometimes it\u2019s more cathartic to just say que sera sera and move on with your life while they all stew in their insanity pit. I\u2019m sorry for the essay but good luck I wish you the best.",

He dates children, spends all his money on partying, can't keep a job, is violent to his siblings and parents, drives under the influence, and just makes really bad decisions. He once even pulled a tazer on my boyfriend \"as a joke\" and got mad at us for being upset that he would do that.\n\n When I was still living at home, he came into my room on two different occasions and asked me to do his chore for him. I told him no, as on both occassions I had my friend over, and he immediately became aggressive, squaring his shoulders and walking towards me, yelling profanities, telling me how much my parents hated me and making up fake conversation he'd had with them where they expressed these things, to the point I was shaking and crying in fear. My friend no longer came over if his car was there because she is scared of him now. \n\nI told my mom the second time it happened, and she told him to stop. As I was dropping off my friend at the end of the night, I got a text from him telling me he wasn't being aggressive, but if I kept \"lying\" to mom and dad about what he was doing, he would show me aggressive. My parents told me they couldn't do anything because they didn't see it happen and didn't want to look like they were taking sides, despite a threat to my physical safety. So I went to stay with my boyfriend and his parents that night, and stayed over anytime I could. \n\nAny time my brother and I fought after that, my parents told me I needed to work it out with him instead of protecting me when he became violent. They told me I must be enguaging him, or egging him on, and that if he started anything, I needed to just ignore him. If he comes into my room and throws the books off my shelf because he wants me to do dishes for him so he can go get drunk, *I* have to ignore him, and just go to another room. They wonder why I don't come around anymore, and tell me I need to get over my differences with him because it takes two to have a fight, and as family we have to learn to get along. \n\n If a man physically a foot and a half taller than me comes into my space and starts throwing things, threatening the safety of my friends, trying to manipulate me by telling me about fake conversations he has with my parents, and threatening to attack me, of course I'm not going to want to stay in the house. Of course I'm not going to want my friend to come over. Of course I'm going to stay somewhere else, and of course I'm not going to talk to him. Yet I hold an equal part in our \"fight\"? No, fuck that. Control your man child.",

Your mom and sister have twisted you and gaslit you so badly that you believe standing up for yourself and setting boundaries is wrong and bad.\n\nI'm afraid that if you don't seek some form of help that you mom will eventually get you back under her thumb and you'll be hurt again.",

You can only change yourself and your own situation. It is great that your boyfriend is receptive and understanding of what is going on. The fact that you trust each other and mutually experienced the whole thing just solidifies the reality of it. Don't allow anyone to gaslight you and don't second guess yourself.",

That took alot of guts.\n\nThere's no good reason your mom picked a favorite. Most likely she just enjoys the way your sister eats up all the affection. Maybe she's even subconsciously realized that your sister becomes happier when she's shitty to you. I understand your pain (I wanted my mom to be a good mother, too), but fuck, it will just not happen. It's healthier to just accept she will never do right by you than it is to try and try to make it work. Giving up on my family was both the most painful thing I've ever done, and also the best decision of my life.\n\nYou'll come out of this better, I swear. And if you ever want your own family you'll know exactly what NOT to do. Best of luck to ya, and don't give in!!!",

I was really hoping we'd hear from you again, you found your inner badass and took the trash out. The most important thing is you and your boyfriend will never forget this moment. Take time to celebrate this weekend!!!",

Standing up for yourself against family can feel near impossible but at the end of the day you have every right to put yourself first and your sisters behaviour was unacceptable. \n\nIn regards to your mum, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s crushing to do the right thing but get penalised for it. My mum is very much the same and no matter how much of a \u201cperfect\u201d daughter I am she will still always find fault and manage to play the victim at the same time. I\u2019ve had to learn to take it with a pinch of salt, you\u2019re all adults and you don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s approval before you make your decisions/live your life. You cant please everyone and shouldn\u2019t have to. Just live your life now and be happy.",

She sounds like the type that will try to one up you on everything and that includes trying to prove she\u2019s \u201cbetter\u201d by trying to sleep with your boyfriend in your own fucking house while you\u2019re doing her a favour. DO NOT apologise to her.\n\nAnd fuck your mum too. Honestly how dare she try to pin the blame on your boyfriend while your sister is lounging around in her underwear and touching him at every opportunity.\n\nYou don\u2019t need these people. And showing them that you will not tolerate their bullshit and they cannot manipulate you is badass as fuck.\n\nContinue to set boundaries and as soon as any of them try to cross them, stay strong and firm, and put them straight back in their place.",

She is not a good person.\n\nI'm sorry your mother reacted that way.  Maybe the next step is setting boundaries for her. If she can't respect them, there will be consequences. It will be up to her if she is allowed in your life or not.",

It's complicated for you because as long as you backed down and accommodated, your mom would be at least generally OK with you. When you stuck up for yourself to the \"Golden Child\", you knew both she and your mom would gang up on you.  I'm so sorry, OP, that your mother is not a better person. However,  you set boundaries, you did it! Perhaps, once the dust settles,  this will lead to them respecting you.  Even if it does not, you did it, and should be very proud of yourself",

Always be polite and amenable, always smile, never cause a scene, etc etc. Im 40 and I only recently started asserting boundaries with her. It's been very difficult, and she has behaved like a toddler at times.\n\nMy brother tends to be extremely opinionated on Facebook and he goes onto forums especially designed for arguing with people. He likes to troll pages that are the opposite of his viewpoints. One day recently I challenged his viewpoint by saying something objective &amp; my mom gave me the silent treatment, told me she was disappointed in me &amp; trashed me for \"doing that to family\".\n\nYou're lucky that you've broken the pattern 20 years before I did. That's amazing work \ud83d\udc4f",

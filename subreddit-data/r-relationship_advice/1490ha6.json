    "postText": "So my boyfriend and I fight all the time. I won't blame him for everything but when he gets mad a frustrated he says things like he can't continue this, yesterday he told me he would rather be alone, he also said I am insecurity and controlling. I leave and he acts like he doesn't care but messages me after I leave saying I shouldn't have left and that the promise ring he gave me means we stay together through better and worst.\nThe thing is I am a lot too blame too for our fights because of anxiety and concerns that I have. Some stuff I worry about is so dumb because he has never ever given me a reason to be unfaithful or like to me. I know those worries and insecurities stems from my personal issues which I am working on. I am seeking help, working on my physical health, going to school for aviation\u2026etc. I also try to tell myself I can be better but also have to pat myself on the back because I mentally have came along ways. Of course I cannot expect my bf to understand that because he didn't know me back then. Anyways... When I constantly question him I know it frustrates him, but some of the things ask of him are not too much too ask for. I can handle being frustrated but when he starts saying things and yelling at me I get so hurt. Last time he yelled saying \"no girl girl requires this, the only one that requires it is insecure and controlling!\" Then he will say things like \"yeah do me a favor and shut your mouth\". Also he will say \"back the fuck off\". He will apologize afterwards. Last time we fought I left and he says if vou want to leave so bad then go. Then later on he says \"sorry your feelings were hurt, mines were hurt too\" I haven't gone back, I told him I need to think about this. He texted me \"r I want you to come home.\" He is a really good guy he means well but his temper is hurting me and my confidence.  What does everyone think of the situation?",

It seems like there are some issues you guys have to work with and by U2 being together, you guys are not bringing out the best in each other. So if you guys wanna continue moving forward, you should seek some professional counseling to see if there are things you guys can really work through.",

If my gf couldn\u2019t trust me and needed constant verifications then fuck that shit. You need to be single until you deal with your trauma. This relationship is a disaster for both of you.",

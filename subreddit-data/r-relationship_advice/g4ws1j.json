    "postText": "And I'm not so sure I agree. Our son is a senior atm but, he's expected to be graduating this year. He'll be turning 18 in August and that's when my husband wants to kick him out. He's persistent in his beliefs and unwavering he wants him to spread his wings, to handle life on his own. That also means we won't be giving him any sort of financial aid, etc.  It's not as if our son is lazy. He's a very hard worker and spends most his time cracking the books or at after school football practice. But, he wanted to hold off on College just until he can get a good idea to what he wants.  Personally, I found it very mature of him to want too but, my husband disagrees and thinks it's a sign of him being lazy and immature. We've been arguing non-stop. \n\nMy argument is so long as he is working and helping out what's the harm in him staying? Why should one be expected to abandon their kids the moment they've become adults? He's our only child; our baby. I want him to leave when he is ready. Why push him out so soon? I sort of feel that as a mother I've failed if I'm abandoning him so soon when he isn't ready.",

She put herself through community college, then university. She didn't really ever talk to her parents though, and she hasn't visited our home town since she left.",

So to add insult to injury, they get to take credit for their kids overcoming the struggles they'll face on their own.",

Here in Australia, university is free at point of use*, but even so I struggled. I couldn\u2019t qualify for student allowance because my dad refused to fill out the tax paperwork because he said I had to do it on my own. He was probably filing fraudulent taxes tbh. My mum tried to send me money but she was living overseas and disabled after a massive stroke, so financially it wasn\u2019t much and I felt fucking *awful* accepting my disabled mum\u2019s money. She tried her best to support me emotionally.\n\nI worked two part time jobs. I was in a very competitive degree, I had to re-sit multiple exams because I kept failing them. I remember looking at my classmates with bitter envy who were complaining because they had studied four hours last night, wishing I had that sort of time to study. I made nearly no friends at uni because I had no time to socialise. That entire period of my life feels shrouded in a foggy grey haze of exhaustion and depression. \n\nMy four year degree became a six year degree after I had to drop back to part time for 2 years. I had multiple mental health crises. I don\u2019t wish it on anyone. \n\nI\u2019m okay now. I graduated and started working and I\u2019m alright. But I have zero relationship with my dad. I haven\u2019t spoken to him in close to a decade and I don\u2019t ever want to. He kicked my feet from under me just as I was learning how to metaphorically walk by myself in an adult\u2019s world. If OP lets her husband do this to her son, their relationship with him will be forever strained at best.\n\n\n *You take out a HECS loan from the government, which you still have to repay, but only once you start earning over $55K/year, no interest accrued, and it\u2019s charged at 4.5% of your gross annual income.",

He was a wonderful, sweet, lovely person and his dad lived in another state and was never really present in his life, so when he turned 18 and his mom picked up and moved away, it left him with no support at all.\n\nThis was over 15 years ago. That guy never got more than that HS education because he always had to pay rent in LA county, so he was busting his ass working minimum wage jobs (what other kind of job will you get at 18?) just to keep a roof over his head and keep himself fed.\n\nHe really tried but where others could take internships he couldn\u2019t even pay college tuition. He\u2019s struggled his whole life trying to do better for himself but was given a shit position to start.\n\nHe has never complained about it but I know in his most vulnerable moments he admitted to feeling abandoned by both his parents. They pretty much consigned him to a life of struggle trying to dig himself out of poverty.\n\nDoing that to a good kid is shitty.\n\n\nEdited to mention:  they dropped his little brother on him too, btw.  These people sucked. I also love the comments (some deleted) saying things like \u201csuck it up\u201d and \u201cthey don\u2019t owe you money\u201d.  What part of always worked and never complained are you missing?  Only in his most vulnerable moments did he ever admit to me, his gf of 5 years, that he was just hurt that his parents didn\u2019t seem to care at all about his well-being.  I remember calling up my dad and thanking him after that convo because while at one point we were so broke we lost our house &amp; had to get food from the homeless shelter, I never once for a second had to wonder if my parents loved me or if they\u2019d be there for me if they could.\n\nTo the people saying that dumb shit, you view your relationships as transactions, and I feel badly for you.",

But also, life is very random, things don't always work out, luck plays as big a part as hard work. So in the end, it's a bit of a wash. What can I say. I still love them, but financially (not just in how they cared for me, but in how they look after their own finances and future) they have had a fairly average financial outcome in life instead of an extraordinarily great outcome.\n\nEDIT:  I don't want to guilt trip OP. I would suggest I mild disconnect, they will be fine. Eg, just check in and make sure they have food, housing, and school is paid up. If they get desperate they will have credit card offers thrown all over them at like 20+% interest with like a $1000 limit, and that will screw them later. You'd be better paying them to NOT take a credit card in college, but you have to be all over it and ready to help out when cash crunches happen. A part time job won't kill your kid off. BUT - college can be very hard, and so dont underestimate what even half-support can do to help. College financial aid will assume you are 100% behind them and charge you or them accordingly.",

Then he can figure out what he wants to do while still getting college credits for cheap, then transfer to a four year.  It gives him time to grow up although he sounds pretty mature already not wanting to go to college and get tons of debt for classes he may not need.\n\nIf you get a degree in general studies from a community college, you can generally transfer to a real school and finish a four year degree in 2.5 years.  GPA resets, you save tens of thousands in tuition, you have a few years to figure out who you are out of high school, and the ONLY name on your degree is your four-year college.",

Way cheaper than university, allowed me to explore my interests and be one of the better students in my classes, gaining some relationships with my teachers I probably would not of otherwise had.

The week after we graduated she was kicked out because she was an adult.

She got into an abusive relationship she was afraid to leave because she would be homeless, ended up pregnant, had to work 2 full time jobs to get away from the father, got into another bad relationship and had another kid, got laid off with no savings, and now lives with a friend in a 2 bedroom apartment with 6 kids between them. \n\nShe went from honor roll student with dreams of being a lawyer to this all because her parents decided she needed to take care of her 100% with no help at 18. \n\nOh and by the way her parents have never met their grandchildren.",

Your son has a job and motivation to learn. I promise from personal experience that if you're going to bed hungry, worrying about keeping a roof over your head, or grinding out 40+ hours at a job most people won't have the drive to do more, but just scrape by. \n\nMaybe making your husband literally write out the expenses it takes, food, rent, utilities, auto insurance, gas, plus the enormous cost of attending college. He's going to see it takes an astronomical amount of money. \n\nI really wish the best for you and your son and I hope your husband can understand the simple logic the world isnt the same as 20 years ago.",

Please don\u2019t let your child be kicked out of the door into the fire unless there\u2019s something warranting it. By your description, he sounds like he\u2019s doing his best in school and working diligently. \n\nMy significant other was kicked out at 18 regardless of going to school and having multiples jobs, he couldn\u2019t afford a place to love so he lived in his car for 6 months until he had credit and a reliable roommate to split bills. His relationship has not recovered with his parents and it has been 6 years. \n\nMy parents let me stay at home, pay some bills and contribute to groceries. It helped me be able to save some money and move out on my own comfortably. I\u2019ve now been living on my own for 2 years! I love my parents so much for allowing me that opportunity.\n\nI don\u2019t know your son, but you paint a very nice and hardworking picture of him. I\u2019m also sure he doesn\u2019t want to live with you all forever. I think you should argue for letting him stay. If he is as motivated as you portray, I imagine he\u2019ll be there for only about 1-4 years. You just don\u2019t get the same \u201cfreedoms\u201d living with the folks. I would suggest if the major pain is he isn\u2019t going to college right out of high school, encourage him to take some gen eds in the meantime at a community college. It\u2019s cheaper, he can meet new people and it gives him a boost when he decides if he wants to start a specific degree path or even on his resume for jobs.",

If you let your husband kick him out, then you have allowed it to happen and you both deserve his resentment and hatred, and should both feel guilty.\n\nYou need to put your foot down as half of the control over the household if you don't want your son kicked out.  You don't need to argue and convince your husband because it's not up to just him.  Legally, and morally, he and you both need to agree to kick him out to have it done because you both own the house and assets.\n\nYour son is making a smart decision, because I've seen so many people who wasted years in college because they either didn't know what they wanted to do, or they chose too quickly under pressure and ended up switching majors late, and wasting years, or just choosing a different career after graduation.  Even I am in a completely unrelated field than what I studied in college and regret not spending more time figuring out what I wanted to do.  Some people decide to go to fields that don't require any college education at all(apprenticeships for electrician/skilled labor, musicians, real estate appraisal certification, etc.).",

This is insanity.\n\nI also just want to say not having the chance to go to college has had a horrible impact on my life. I have struggled for everything. I have almost died 3 times and I'm 29 . Like not of a bus missed me no like I got beat to the bone, found out I had a brain tumor , and some other things I won't mention. Life on your own is barely possible now. I lived in a shed for a year and lived off rice and worked 3 jobs . Do you want this for him too.\n\nAnyone whose says this makes you tough is foolish it makes you damaged. I have countless mental and physical health issues now. I would give anything to have good reliable parents. If I had any support when I was younger so many possibilities could have been open to me.

There is a BOATLOAD of research that demonstrates taking a gap year between high school and undergrad is correlated with higher college achievement. Parental support, whether emotional or financial, has also been correlated.\n\nProblem 3. Financially, he won't have any way to get housing or a vehicle. It generally takes weeks to months for someone to find a suitable apartment to rent. He won't be able to apply for financial aid without a parent to cosign on forms. He will have no health insurance if he gets sick or injured, no car insurance of he needs to drive. Does he even have an isolated bank account or a form of income that you and your husband don't have control over?\n\nProblem 4. This will destroy your relationship with your son, and eventually will damage relationships with other family. If he calls an uncle, a grandmother, a family friend, and they are told what you did, YOU WILL LOSE PEOPLE. They will not stand with your husband on this, especially now that many people are losing their family members because of the virus.\n\nThis has to be a hard no.

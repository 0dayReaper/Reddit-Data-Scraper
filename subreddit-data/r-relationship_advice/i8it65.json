I did my investigating before talking to her. I went through his social media first but nothing explicitly saying anything was going on. There were a few mentions of \u201chis love\u201d in some comments but that could mean anything.  I did look at the phone bill and there looks to be calls with him pretty regularly. \n\nOn to hers, I was able to get on her phone when she was asleep. (She must of forgot I knew the code) Nothing in texts and no weird calls. (So she deleted them) I did find some apps she tried to keep \u201chidden\u201d like Snapchat and Kik. Sure enough, there\u2019s their conversations. And pictures. (I took pictures of all of it on my phone to have as proof) She exploded when we had the conversation and left with our child to her mothers. \n\nI contacted a lawyer and am in the process of a divorce and figuring out custody. I\u2019m heartbroken and am more angry than anything else. I\u2019m angry at her but I\u2019m also angry at myself for dismissing so many red flags.\n\nETA The conversations I found were confirming they were having an affair. The pictures were ones they were exchanging, including nudes",

Not only can literally nothing positive emerge from it there really is nothing wrong with love and trust.\n\nThat said though, I recommend thinking very carefully about the character traits of the person that abused your trust. In my experience they are rarely the perfect incarnations of The Evil Manipulator. In fact, in my experience they have all been not quite as fucking clever as they thought they were being. Maybe it's similar in your situation OP, and you can take an active hand making sure the next person you extend trust and love is worthy of it.",

My ex MIL was married to her ex husband for 28 years and then cheated on him and to make matters worse she had the most pathetic excuse of he never took her out anymore and never did anything around the house that she asked him to. Like household projects. \n\nSo she does this, moves into the other man's house and he still had to pay her alimony and on top of this the judge ordered him to pay her $30K that she spent in A MONTH on all sorts of materialistic bullshit. Clothes, shoes, purses, getting her nails done etc. She also lived comfortably on the alimony. \n\nMeanwhile, he was a broken man. He walked around the house like his world had ended. I hated her and still do to this day because she's vain and narcissistic and claims to be a Christian but judges everyone and holds grudges as if she has room to. She also purposely ruined my long term relationship with her son by openly expressing her hatred of me though I've given her no reason to dislike me and treating him as a surrogate spouse.\n\n When he remarried she actually had the audacity to call his new wife the other woman! I'm glad he's happy and I'm glad karma bit her in the ass. She lives in a tiny efficiency apartment, like 800 square feet tiny and she got fat and complains that no one wants to be with her even though her personality is shit. Her ex husband lives in their old home with his wife and it's a beautiful home. \n\nShe still says she regrets cheating on him and leaving him. It's clear that she's still in love with him but he of course wants nothing to do with her lol. Did I mention I hate her lol? The best part is that he got to stop paying her alimony because they had mediation with an attorney present and she signed away her right to alimony.\n\n She claims she didn't know what she was signing and that she's gonna take him back to court to get it back and that she's gonna draw from his social security checks when he turns 65 which may have already happened. She's living on SSI and social security. I think that's a terrible law, she shouldn't be able to take even more money from him. I hope she's happy with the mess she created. She deserves every minute of her misery. Bitch.",

It hurt a lot, to find out her cheating was so long, and that our marriage was a lie for at least 5 or 6 years.  \n\n\nIn the end, I decided that he is and always will be my son.  The fact he was born from my ex-wife's infidelity does not change that I love him just as though he was my own blood or adopted.  I told him the truth when he was 7 years old, so that it would become normalized and he would not be shocked in later life when he someday does a dna test or whatever.   \n\n\nThe reality is that the court will determine what is in the best interest of the child.  Even if you are not the bio-dad of your \"son\"... you will still be on the hook to support him financially.  It's stupid, but that's how it works, because the court believes the child's needs are more important than yours.   \n\n\nGood luck.  \n\n\nPro Tip:   Never get mad at your ex.  She could use that against you.  be careful what you say/write.   People suck.   Learning to trust again is really difficult.  But it's worth it.  Please try to get counselling to help you work through any trust issues and just talk about how you're feeling.  It's helpful, even if you don't really think it is, to talk and get that crap out into the light.  You were and are wounded.  Heal well, and your life will be better in the end.  \n\n\nAnd also the usual about going to the gym, delete facebook, and prepare to pay hugely for your lawyer.",

Document how long she has been gone. \n\n3) Do not, under any circumstance, engage in any sort of reconciliation whether it\u2019s a discussion, counseling, or even having sex. In many states this will throw grounds of adultery out the window. \n\n4) Ask for times to get your child and document any refusals or broken promises. \n\nObviously a lot of this will depend heavily on your state\u2019s divorce statutes and case law. An attorney will help you sort all of that out. At this point your only objective is to maximize time with your child if you\u2019re not seeking custody (50/50 is optimal if you\u2019re both good parents) and minimize damage to yourself resulting from the divorce. Also, don\u2019t be shy about adding as many necessary clauses that will prevent headache down the road to your divorce papers. This includes holidays, birthdays, morals clause, travel notifications/restrictions, extracurricular expenses and activities, insurance, healthcare, and literally anything you can think of. Believe me, for most people co-parenting is a pain in the ass. Especially after the marriage is dissolved under shitty circumstances. And most of the time it\u2019s coming from the offending spouse. \n\nAnyway, good luck, and don\u2019t be shy about asking questions in r/divorce and r/custody.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention that r/survivinginfidelity is a good place to go for moral support. The emotions experienced after being cheated on in a marriage are a nightmare. It feels like someone died, but the person you\u2019re mourning is still alive and destroying your life. Find a therapist. And don\u2019t just settle on the first one you meet. I had to go through a few quacks before I landed on someone that was helpful.",

Lots of people talking about your feelings and fuck her and that's good and all but you really need to focus on what to do NOW! \n\nDo not leave the house that is considered abandonment and could cost you your child (pending DNA testing I understand). Get your finances in order and change your passwords on everything, especially bank accounts. Any shared accounts and any other tangible items obtained throughout your entire marriage are still considered the both of yours until there is at minimum a PSA (property settlement agreement) drafted and signed by both parties. Cars, savings, 401k, ANYTHING! As stated document EVERYTHING including calls, items you buy for your child, when you spend time with your child, everything. Unfortunately texts and most things sent electronically are thrown out in court because they can be faked. It's incredibly difficult to prove infidelity unless you hire a P.I. to collect hard evidence. Even still most judges don't really give a shit. It moreso comes down to what's best for the child and how assets will be allocated. Most states the parents have equal right to custody, 50/50. That being said neither should be collecting child support and/or alimony. \n\nDO NOT LET YOUR EMOTIONS CONTROL YOU! If you blow your top in any way towards her and that is recorded it would be detrimental to your case.\n\nSorry for your luck but you're better off. I went through this years ago and thought my life was over.  My ex and I now share our son 50/50 and have raised him to be an incredible kid. We're both in new relationships and keep things civil.. mostly. I'm 100xs happier in my new relationship and she is the best stepmom I could ask for. We're actually set to marry this Fall after 3 years and trust me when I say this chapter of my life is infinitely better than the last!  Good luck brother and keep your head high!",

The whole \"as the kids get older you can get more custody\" thing is bullshit.

Anyway, a few months went by and eventually I found her real account on Instagram. She also had a Facebook account which she had blocked me on(!) so that I could never find it. Both were private so I made a fake account and followed her Instagram because I knew she'd lie about whatever was hidden away if I asked her about it upfront.\n\nTurned out she was still seeing her ex bf to some degree (she had told me they hadn't spoken for about 8 months yet there was a picture of them together just a month earlier and a bunch of posts suggesting they were involved romantically). When I confronted her about it she somehow managed to turn the focus on me being bad for finding it and making making a fake account. Like bitch, what the fuck?\n\nStupid me ended up taking her back and we had an on/off relationship for 2 more years. She ended up breaking my heart. Don't be me.",

They had been effectively dating - for months. \n\nFor me, I was 100% done when I found out. The amount of deceit it takes to pull that off will no longer allow me to view her with any moral compass. Ever. \n\nLock bank account. Lawyer up. Delete facebook. Hit the gym. Get a therapist and fucking read read read. Lean into yourself, your emotional intelligence.  Get and keep your mind right.  \n\nI read a shit ton ok divorce, infidelity, listened to interviews, and hit some good subs. Pour into your mental for objective perspective and clarity. \n\nI literally did all of those. Be cordial but grow a cold emotionless heart. Anger is normal but wasted when you can focus on executing the divorce and moving on with self care and grace for the future. \n\nIf no kids together, make a clean break and go no contact. Nothing. Radio silence.  Block on everything. \n\nOnce you make the decision to divorce, make peace with it, hunker down and focus to the goal line. \n\nLet me add - you did not deserve this. You did not fail. This was not your fault. We as men tend to view failure of a marriage as a failure of ourselves. This is simply not true. She is the piece of shit. Not you. \n\nDo not accept any apologies, gas lighting, trickle truthing, and crys, begs, weeping to \u201cmake it work\u201d. For me, this was a \u201cbroke\u201d that could never be fixed.

Fuck that and fuck those people.  When reasonable people are confronted with reasonable suspicion, then taking reasonable actions to clarify the situation is completely justifiable.  Another thing open phone and computer and everything else for both partners is an absolute must.  That's what trust is...knowing that your partner trusts you enough to open up all aspects of their life to  you.  My wife and I have open phone and whatever else we never discussed it per se,  but my wife doesn't lock her phone and I only have a code on mine because when I did set up I messed up and set one, but she knows my code and uses it anytime she wants.

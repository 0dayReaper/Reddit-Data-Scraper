    "postText": "Before I begin, my apologies if anything I write sounds weird, my native language is not English.  \nI think I\\`ll start were the trouble began; a few days ago I went to a party and to keep it short, they had weed, I underestimated how strong it was, and during that while I was not really able to think a dude (M18) came up to me and gave me his number. Even then I just generally felt bad for giving him my number, mainly because technically I still am in an relationship (of a year and 4 months, with 19F), but I have a strong feeling this relationship is about to end. I really don\\`t want it to end, but it still probably will.  \nSo a little over a month ago I was laying in bed with my current girlfriend and we were just about to go sleep, but it kinda felt like she wasn\\`t doing good, so I asked her if something was up. She then told me she has the feeling like we just kinda drifted apart from each other. It really hit me like a brick on the head, I wasn\\`t prepared at all for something like that. We both cried and later that night when we had calmed down a little bit we also talked about it for some time. During the crying and talking she said that it was easier to break up with her ex than with me, meaning her original plan was to break up with me that night. When we were ready again to lay down and sleep I obviously didn\\`t try to cuddle with her, but after about a minute she asked me to. That was quite a confusing moment, so I asked her if she was even sure if she wants to break up with me (Sidenote: she has autism which makes emotional stuff in general really complicated), to which she replied that she doesn\\`t know.  \nIts now been a little more than a month since this happened and she still couldn\\`t give me an actual answer but she mostly refuses to talk with me (to which I asked her if I did something wrong, she said I didn\\`t), she doesn\\`t really reply to my texts (which are most of the time just me asking how shes doing or if she wants to talk to me, and in about half of the cases of the latter some of her friends would be there too and I don\\`t speak with them about that topic when shes around, but she knows that I did talk to them about it, I did so with her permission) often even after she saw them. To the question if she wants some distance from me right now she said she didn\\`t know and how I came to that idea. This with some other small things not really worth mentioning gives me the general feeling that in the end she will break up. Because of that I thought about just ending the relationship several times during this last month.  \nAnd now that the person who gave me his number shows more interest in me in 2 days than her in a month just more so makes me think about breaking up with her and trying with him. The breakup would be (at least for me) still be a tragic thing because she really means much to me.\n\nShould I break up with her? Which would probably also mean that I\\`m gonna try with him.   \nI\\`m open to answer any questions about the situation  \nTLDR: Someone whos interested in me gave me his number, but I am still in an relationship, but I think the relationship is about to end anyways, thinking about trying with him",

            "comment": "Years ago, I was engaged with a guy. I went to visit family and went to a kid's bday party with them. I met someone there I couldn't stop talking to, he was just so easy and fun. I knew at that moment that whether anything came of it or not, my interest in my then-fiancee was gone. It had been dying for a while anyway, that was just the final confirmation I needed to leave. As for the guy I met at the party, we've been married 14 years and have 2 kids.\n\nPoint being, it's time to take a look at your feelings. Setting aside the question of the phone number, are you happy if things stay the way they are? What will make you more happy and content? This might tear your relationship apart, or it may strengthen it. Which will make you happier long-term?",

    "postText": "My gf and I have been together for 10 months. For context, we\u2019ve known each other for 15 years, and only recently started dating after we reconnected and discovered we always had a crush on each other. It\u2019s honestly been the best and most amazing relationship I\u2019ve ever been in. And that\u2019s what hurts the most. \n\nRecently, my gf has been extremely hesitant to spend time with me. Further context, she has 2 kids from a previous relationship, and I\u2019ve done everything I can to support her and her kids. She also has multiple pets. We live about 2 hours away from each other, but I\u2019ve always come to visit on as many days off as I have. Additionally, I\u2019ve helped her pay rent, bills, food and clothes for the kids, classes for her oldest, helped her with her house chores, etc. But she still refuses to visit me in my town, shoots down any plans I make, including those I make to accommodate her kids and pets, etc. She used to visit me in my town multiple times when we were first dating, and yet only recently did pets and kids suddenly become an issue. She\u2019s also expressed that she has problems accepting financial help because of how she was raised. To be fair, I understand how she feels because I was raised the same way: \u201cBe independent. No one will help you except yourself.\u201d I understand why she doesn\u2019t want help, but after 10 months, she still refuses my help even in times I know she needs it. Recently, I bought her a new AC after her central AC went out and she and her kids were forced to sleep on the couch because her room was too hot. Not only did she not thank me for it, she actually got upset that I bought it without her asking me too. \n\nAltogether, it\u2019s made me feel unloved and unappreciated because I\u2019ve given my EVERYTHING to this woman. I confronted her directly because I wanted to do the healthy thing and not be passive aggressive about it. Her exact words were \u201cstop helping\u201d. It honestly destroyed me. Part of the way I show love is acts of service, but she\u2019s made it clear she doesn\u2019t want that. I feel like we\u2019re heading for an immediate breakup. I don\u2019t want that because I\u2019ve never felt more in love with anyone before. I don\u2019t want to lose her, but for her to tell me to stop supporting her is basically to tell me not to giver her my all. She even told me she feels unloved because I\u2019ve been so distant lately, hence why I told her exactly what I was feeling. She makes slightly more money than I do, but every bit of her money goes to rent, bills, and the basics. I\u2019ve been trying to support her where she falls short and doing everything I can to give her and her kids a better quality of life. That\u2019s how I show love. Oh, and let me just nip this in the bud, no she\u2019s not cheating. We both abhor cheating due to past experiences, and both of us have access to each others phones. We even swapped phones to check and obviously neither of us are guilty of infidelity. This is purely between her and I.",

Give her your all with your emotional support. \n\nShe wants to be independent,  she doesn't want your monetary help.\n\nIt's only sweet and caring if she actually wants it but instead it's making her uncomfortable and unhappy. \n\nYou need to be able to listen to your partner and what they actually need instead of deciding to play hero and ignore what they actually want. No relationship is going to survive happily like this.\n\nOf course, as far as not visiting you and shooting down plans isn't ok and something to work on but maybe if you back off on the rest she'll be more open.",

It\u2019s not that I\u2019m proud, it\u2019s that she needed it. I feel like no one should be driven from their own bed, and I didn\u2019t find out they were sleeping on the couch until I came to visit. That\u2019s something she neglected to tell me until I saw it in person. That plus other things she\u2019s had to give up. I don\u2019t want her to have to give anything up. I trust her and I know she knows what she\u2019s doing, but it\u2019s hard to watch her struggle with things that I know I can make a difference with.\n\nEdit: spelling",

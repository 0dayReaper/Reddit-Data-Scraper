    "postText": "\n\nIt's tough for me to say this, but I've reached a point where I want to end my friendship with this girl I've known since 7th grade. We've been through a lot together, but unfortunately, things have changed over the years. We're just not on the same page anymore. She always seems to be in a state of depression, and it's mainly because of the choices she makes \u2013 and they're not the best ones, despite my efforts to guide her and explain why they might not be the right path.\n\nI've tried so hard to help her get back on track, especially with college, but she just doesn't seem interested. Instead, she's content with lower-paying jobs that only seem to make her more and more depressed. It's disheartening to see her settle for less when I've worked hard to graduate from college and secure a great job. My goals and aspirations are constantly evolving, and I want to keep succeeding in life.\n\nThe thing is, whenever we meet or text, it's always a downer. She's constantly sad, and she shares stories about people who are toxic for her, yet she refuses to let them go. On top of that, she tries to drag me into hanging out with her friends ( whom I honestly don't get along with at all) &amp; she became a home-wrecker (which is a big NO for me). It's like a never-ending cycle of negativity, and it feels like she brings bad luck into my life.\n\nTo be honest, I've been contemplating ending our friendship for the past year, but I'm stuck on how to go about it. I really hate drama, and I know that cutting ties will likely cause long dramatic conversations. \n\nI'm seeking advice on what to do in situations like these. What steps should I take to handle this kind of situation? Any advice or insights you guys can offer would be greatly appreciated.",

She's the one with a fucked up life, toxic people, depression, low paying job and you are the one with the bad luck? Sure she wasn't talking about you when she said \"toxic\"?\n\nPeople make bad choices and they pay for that, and that's what she's doing. You may be concerned for her well being (doesn't seem like it either from your words or the question), but she does not have to live up to your standards (who in the world do you think you are?). \n\nYou don't want to be her friend? Stop talking to her. Stop hanging out. She's not a partner that you have to sit down and discuss stuff with. In fact, do her a favour and don't tell her all this, just leave and silently cut ties. There's no way anyone wants to hear how disappointed you are in them because of their life choice, I am sure they already know seeing that they are living their own choices. All she has tried is lean on you for a shoulder, I don't see her asking you to help her out. All you can say is \"bad luck and negativity\". \n\nGood luck with your successful life.",

                    "comment": "I\u2019am just an ordinary person,\n\nMy friend and I used to talk about how we would work hard to escape a life of poverty and living paycheck to paycheck. We dreamed of a better future, so when I went to college, I always encouraged her to join me and find a good career that would lead to a better life for both of us. I wanted us to break free from the cycle of negativity and bad luck that seemed to follow us. I never wanted to leave her behind; I genuinely wanted to achieve that dream together.\n\nMistakes are a part of life, and I've made my fair share of them. However, it's important to acknowledge that actions have consequences, even for the smallest things we do. I've always been there for her, but it can become toxic and depressing for the other person when you consistently offer advice on how to improve their life, only to see them repeatedly choose the opposite path.\n\nMaybe I'am to blame for all of this, but I've always held hope for her to blossom and achieve something great for herself, ever since we were teenagers. She holds a special place in my heart. \n\nHowever, I can understand why you might be focused on seeing me as the one at fault in this situation.\nThank you, for the best wishes!",

I am not blaming you for your friend's misfortune (and yes, I agree that her actions brought it on her). \n\nI didn't know the entire context and replied based on what you said. But fact is she is not doing what you want her to, that might be due to several reasons. Depressed people often lack the motivation to do something. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; it can become toxic and depressing for the other person when you consistently offer advice on how to improve their life, only to see them repeatedly choose the opposite path.\n\nThen don't. You have tried your best and it won't work. Leave it at that. She is an adult too. \n\nI am sorry for the unnecessarily harsh comment I made. Have a nice day!",

    "postText": "This will be a long story so sit right \n\nAll right so I have this friend and let\u2019s call him \u201cJimmy\u201d, me and him go 11 years back. \n\nJimmy used to have a facial deformity and he was picked on a lot because of it but he was a tough kid and didn\u2019t let anyone get to him, he\u2019s since had surgery and the thing is gone. \n\nBut because of the bullying and stuff Jimmy was sort of closed off from trying to make new friends.\n\n2 years ago we started working over the summer at this place and that\u2019s where Jimmy met \u201cMacy\u201d\n\nJimmy and Macy Immediately hit it off and these 2 were like a match made in heaven, he  would always talk about her and couldn\u2019t even say her name without smiling. \n\nHe thought she will be his first and only girlfriend. \n\nHe later asked her out but she turned him down and she said I\u2019m sorry but you\u2019re not my type. I asked her in private for the reason and she said it\u2019s because she\u2019s not attracted to him. Obviously I will never tell Jimmy this.\n\nI\u2019ve never seen Jimmy cry but that day on the drive down he just broke down and it really got to him. He quit the job and didn\u2019t call or text me for a week. \n\nNext time we hung out he was still really sad and he said he\u2019s been crying most nights because he\u2019s not good enough for her and he was falling in love with her. \n\nSome more time went by and we had a sleep over with friends and we decided to watch creed 1 &amp; 2, and after watching that, jimmy\u2019s perspective changed and over the next 2 years he completely transformed himself, I remember we were at the gym one day a song that reminded him of Macy came on and he started getting teary eyed mid set. \n\nHe met this girl recently who pretty similar to Macy and Even looks like her. Not exactly but similar features. \n\nHe told me he\u2019s with her because he\u2019s not over Macy and she\u2019s just like Macy.\n\nShould I telll the girl or just completely stay out of it ?\n\nI explained to Jimmy why it\u2019s wrong but he said he really misses Macy and still loves her",

You will create a rift in your friendship if you do anything to jeopardize things.\n\nIf he was cheating on her, sure, have at it... Tell the girl.\n\nBut this?\n\nNot your place.\n\nAlso, I don't think you're dissecting this deep enough.\n\nMacy isn't just Macy... She is a personality type.\n\nSure, they have a lot of things in common... But Jimmy found the kind of personality he harmonizes with.\n\nHe isn't with her because she is Macy 2.0... He is with her because they have a functioning connection and they get along as well.\n\nSucks that he is not over Macy absolutely. But give him some time to know the new girl. I am sure he will realize that this girl is better than Macy and fall in love with her for different reasons.\n\nWe all have a couple personality types that we function great with. Let him explore her.\n\nIts like someone bringing a new pet home that resembles a recently passed pet. Its comforting to have familiarity. But the more time you spend with the new pet, you start to love them for different and unique reasons.\n\nGive him some time. I am sure that is not the only reason why he's with her. Sometimes it can take a new connection to get over the previous.",

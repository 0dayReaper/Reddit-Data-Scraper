    "postText": "For the majority of nights in the last 6 months or so me and him have spent hours and hours playing video games together, and maybe maybe 2 months back I started to realize I enjoyed his company in less of a friendly sense, and more leaning towards what could be romantically. So I asked him out, which he said yes to. 2 days later he changed his mind, and after some soul searching I accepted that if he didn't feel that way about me that I wouldn't keep pushing it. he's one of my best friends and if that's all we'll ever be then I'm happy with that.\n\nStarting about a week ago he started distancing himself, and maybe 4 days ago we got into an argument, he did something that made me feel like he didn't value our friendship, and I could've reacted better. Long text paragraphs back and forth for the whole weekend ending with him revealing that he thinks that I liked him and would have to let him go romantically eventually. And that it was the primary reason for beginning to distance himself.\n\nWhen I explained that I came to terms with being friends months ago and asked if that's what he thought of me, that the only reason I've spent time with him for all this time was just some 1 sided romantic interest, he immediately switched to a \"Let's move on and forget about all this\" standpoint.\n\nI don't care about him like that, and he says we're cool now, but is now avoiding me too. I miss my friend, and have no clue how to returning to our normal.\n\nHow can I start to fix this?",

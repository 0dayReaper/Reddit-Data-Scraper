    "postText": "So I (25M) have two younger brothers (18M) and (19M) . When they were looking for their first car our mother gave them 1k to help for the deposit. When I asked my mother when if I could have it as a deposit on the dream car. She told me \u201cI\u2019m already an adult and she won\u2019t be helping me\u201d keep in mind both of my brothers were 18/18+ when receiving their 1k. It\u2019s not so much the money to me, it\u2019s more along the lines of I have never been able to receive the things they have. So Amita for assuming it would be even and we would all get 1K",

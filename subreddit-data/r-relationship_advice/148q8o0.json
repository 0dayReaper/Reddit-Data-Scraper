    "postText": "Hi this is my first post on Reddit but I have literally no other place to go to for help.\n\nOne of my oldest friends (we knew each other since I was four) was hit by a car a month ago and she did not make it. I'm utterly devastated and did not turn up at my university for two weeks, and well when I finally turned up and met up with this friend, she of course was very concerned because I hadn't opened messages from her for that time. I explained to her what happened and her reaction was \"I know exactly how you feel, I went through the same two montsh ago when my cat died\" and then she went on to tell in detail how she was able to say gooddbye to him over the phone and how grateful she was about it (shd did need to be able to say it out loud because she really was broken for a month after that happened). I was dumbstruck because I was just crying to her how the possibility, the opportunity for me to say goodbye to my friend was taken away, I can never do that. I know it's selfish because losing a pet is devastating but I was angry that she compared my friend's horrific passing to her cat's at the vet when they knew for a long time that he wouldn't make it. I know it's stupid for me to compare it now too but I need to get it down to show myself that I'm not insane when I thought it was unnecessary and very hurtful. I let it pass and a week ago we go to our morning lecture and meet up with our friendgroup. I did look horrible with bloodshot eyes bur I had to go to the lecture to get out of my apartment. She didn't say hi to me but tapped me on the shoulder and said \"I feel so bad for you\" and looked at me as if she was expecting something. I was staring at her for a long time until I uttered a small \"I know it is horrible\" but these two instances stuck to me because, well, I still don't know what I should have told her because she didn't seem pleased with my answer?\n\nOur mutual friend told me that yesterday she was talking about these two incidents when she talked about how empathetic she is. I don't even know what this post is about I'm just a mess and I think I'm projectiling my grief and anger on to her which is more than unfair, but these instances just hurt me because I just wanted during the first incident to cry my heart out but it turned to me listening to her (although sad) story about her cat's passing, and on the second instance I didn't want to talk about it at all (which I sent to our friend group chat where she is in and they all agreed not to talk about it). I just don't know if my reaction is unnecessary, is my judgement clouded by the grief or something but I'm asking if someone has been in a similiar situation? How did you go through it?",

I was so upset with one friend who wouldn't take a day off work to attend either funeral. I confided in another friend of my hurt and anger and they told me something like the following.. \n\nWe only know pain, when we know the pain.  If you have never broken a bone, you cannot know the pain of breaking a bone. It's hard, almost impossible to empathize with something you have never experienced without it coming across as pity or sometimes even as dismissive. \n\nI think your friend did her best to find something to show her understanding what you are going through. She failed miserably. But she tried. She is lucky to not have something that \"matches\". \n\nI asked my friend for some space while I grieved. Reassured her if I needed anything, I'd reach out. Leaned on other friends. Got counseling. Took care of myself and my family. Forgave her and when I was ready returned to our friendship.  \n\nPlease take care of yourself. Talk to a therapist. Eat well. Get some sleep. Be kind to yourself. Take care.",

First, because pets are not people. As much as we can love them, they are living *things*. We're not afraid to say we *own* a cat, nobody would say they own a sibling or a friend. The bond we can have with them, as strong as it can be, is not of the same kind as with a loved person.\n\nSecond, she's an idiot because, even though I believe it, I wouldn't say what I've said above to somebody who just lost their cat. And she shouldn't have said what she said to somebody who has just lost a human being.\n\nNow you need to have the time to work on your grief. People like her are not useful to you right now.",

It's not you, it's her.\n\nSo sorry about your loss",

            "comment": "My condolences on your friend's passing, OP. Grief is a very personal process. I wish you strength as you go through it.  \n  \nPain is pain and is valid for each person. No one's pain needs to be compared to another's. That being said, I think it's very insensitive of your classmate to talk about her cat's passing while you are in the midst of processing your friend's passing. She should either have offered you support as a friend or if she didn't feel up to offering you emotional support, she could have simply offered you her condolences and kept her distance. Talking about her loss while you are actively processing yours, whether to you or to your mutual friend(s) comes across as immature / insecure behavior. You could mention this to her and/or your mutual friend(s), and tell her / them that you find it insensitive.  \n  \nI also wonder if it is true that you don't want to talk about your loss in the group or is it more likely that even if you want to talk about losing your friend, you're afraid your classmate's going to bring up her cat again and not let you process your grief. If this is the case, please don't avoid talking about your loss in the group. Even though grief can make us turn inward, our support systems can go a long way in helping us manage our responses to grief in a more balanced way.  \n  \nTake care OP and I hope you are able to manage this situation well.",

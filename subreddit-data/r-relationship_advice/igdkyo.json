    "postText": "I changed some minor details for the sake of remaining anonymous. Also, sorry this is so long once I started writing I found it cathartic and couldn\u2019t stop word vomiting all over the post. TL;DR at the bottom!\n\nWhen I was 23 (now 28), I was engaged to Ryan (was 32, now 37). Our engagement ended when my stepsister Kelly (was 24, now 29) begged me to leave him because they loved each other but Ryan was too afraid to break up with because he didn\u2019t want to hurt me/my family. When I confronted Ryan about it, he denied it, said she had been trying to come on to him for some time and he never mentioned it because he didn\u2019t want to ruin our relationship. He begged me not to believe her and so we continued how we were. Kelly grew resentful and made nasty comments about how I was forcing a man who didn\u2019t even love me to marry me because I had low self-esteem constantly. A month later, she sent me a video of them having sex in my bed and multiple screenshots of him telling her he loved her, how he wished she was the girl he was marrying, how he hated that I wouldn\u2019t let them be together. I was devastated and angry, but my best friend convinced me not to go nuclear on them and instead to quietly move out when Ryan was at work the next week. So that\u2019s what I did. I contacted my dad and my stepmom and asked them if I could move in temporarily. I removed the money I had contributed into our joint account for wedding expenses and transferred the rest to him before closing the account. Once I got settled in, I sent all of the screenshots she sent me to all of our relatives and his. \n\nRyan tried to get back together with me multiple times, but I ended up blocking him when I found out he had proposed to her with the same ring he gave me (I left it behind). Now Kelly is my stepsister from my mom\u2019s side. I have another stepsister (36) and stepbrother (38) from my mom\u2019s second marriage and a half-sister (26). They all went to the wedding. Whenever I tried to express I was hurt by the fact they were just supporting Kelly/Ryan as though what they did to me meant nothing they would shrug it off and say they couldn\u2019t cut them out completely because they were family. I haven\u2019t spent a single holiday with my mom\u2019s side since, neither has my older biological brother or sister. I only see my mom and half-sister when I invite them over to my place as Kelly/Ryan moved in with my mom and my stepdad a year after they got married. Our relationship is very rocky, but I\u2019ve grown closer to my dad/stepmom and their children (an older stepbrother and two younger half-siblings), who have all been very supportive since this all happened, so it\u2019s not all been bad.\n\nOn new years day my boyfriend (now husband) proposed to me. We had a small engagement party which I invited my mom and half-sister too. They never turned up because I was \u201cexcluding half of our family\u201d. I never invited my stepdad or stepsiblings because they were pretty hurtful when it came out that Kelly/Ryan were sleeping together. They claimed it wasn\u2019t their fault I got in the way of \u201ctrue love\u201d and made me out to be some sort of vindictive Disney villain for being angry with them. We were planning to have our wedding ceremony this summer, but in late February my husband suggested we postponed until next year because he was concerned COVID would get worse and we would have to cancel/reschedule anyway. I ended up finding out I was pregnant a month before our original wedding date, so we had a courthouse wedding on that date with the plan to hold the ceremony next year. Only my dad\u2019s side of the family were aware of both the pregnancy and the wedding.\n\nMy stepmom likes to knit so she\u2019s been making some stuff for the baby. Recently, she posted about the things she had made on facebook with a caption talking about how excited she was to have another grandchild soon. I was tagged in the post. I have zero issues with the post. I never told my family I wasn\u2019t going to inform my mom\u2019s side, it wasn\u2019t that I intentionally hid it from her she just never seemed very interested in my life/relationship so I never brought it up.\n\nMy mom called me an hour later to demand to know if I was pregnant and how she couldn\u2019t believe I hadn\u2019t told her she was finally going to be a grandmother. She has since invited me and my husband over to her house multiple times, I\u2019ve declined every single time for the obvious reason. My stepdad, who I\u2019ve barely spoken to in 5 years has reached out to tell me how excited he is to meet the baby and my husband, same with my siblings. Even Kelly reached out to my husband to congratulate us. I was furious. \n\nThe next time my mom and stepdad called me I finally laid into them. I told them I didn\u2019t want them to keep inviting me over when they knew I would be forced to see Kelly/Ryan if I came, I told them how hurt and angry I still am over what they did to me and how my \u2018family\u2019 dismissed my feelings, I told them how they wouldn\u2019t throw Kelly/Ryan away but they were so quick to leave me out to rot whilst I was going through the worst betrayal I\u2019d ever experienced in my life, I told them I wasn\u2019t even sure I wanted people like them in my child\u2019s life. \n\nMy mom was crying hysterically and kept saying I was being cruel, and I couldn\u2019t deprive her of her first grandchild. The thing is, my baby ISN\u2019T her first grandchild, my sister has two adopted daughters already who my mom doesn\u2019t even try to bond with. She kept wailing about how I might be the only person in our family to even give her grandchildren (my stepsisters are both having a hard time getting/staying pregnant and my half-sister has proclaimed herself to be child free). \n\nMy stepdad got angry and defensive. He claimed I was petty for holding onto something that happened 5 years ago. He pointed out how I had found someone else so I should understand how love works and sometimes two people just can\u2019t help themselves. You love who you love, basically. He said Kelly/Ryan were happy together, so I should be happy for them the way they\u2019re happy for me and my husband. The ironic thing is my sister told me Kelly/Ryan looked like they were on the verge of divorce and they argue constantly (my mom complains to her about them) and how my siblings all hate him but pretend they like him for Kelly\u2019s sake. \n\nI ended up hanging up because I was so angry and when I get angry, I start crying, I didn\u2019t want them to think they got to me. \n\nSince, I\u2019ve been receiving texts and calls nonstop from my mom\u2019s family. They\u2019re all essentially telling me I should be over things already. It\u2019s gotten to the point me and my husband have switched phones so he can screen my messages for me, and I don\u2019t have to read them.\n\nTL;DR \u2013 My stepsister slept with my ex- fianc\u00e9 and married him. I\u2019m now happily married to someone else and we\u2019re expecting our first child together. My family thinks I should be over it already since I\u2019ve moved on, but the anger is still there, and I have no interest in forming a relationship with my ex or my stepsister again. They\u2019re now putting pressure on me to try and get me to forget it ever happened.  \n\nHow do I make my family understand just how unforgiveable what Kelly/Ryan have done to me is? I would prefer not to go completely no contact but is that my only option here?",

They aren't going to say anything you haven't already heard, and none of it is helpful or kind.\n\nI hope you have a therapist you can work with on all of this stuff. \n\nCongrats on the baby!",

There is no \"true love\" because love isn't something that's found like attraction, lust, a crush, etc are. Love is something that's forged and maintained. Love can rust and fall apart without that maintenance. If you let an outside flame into your life, you can create slag and weaken the relationship. If you let that fire grow more it can completely melt it, leaving you with nothing but a memory of the once beautiful craftsmanship.",

On Halloween weekend, my ex was going to go out partying. He texted me halfway through the night (like 8pm?) that he was bored and coming home. I stayed in because I was in pain from a misplaced IUD and miserable, emotional mess. \n\nSuddenly it was 2-3 am and he was nowhere to be found. I called him a ton at 4:00am and finally by 5:00am he came home. I felt betrayed, I ugly cried until I fell asleep (again, hormones) and he felt I \u201cruined his night out\u201d despite the fact he came home at 5:00am. \n\nThe next day, all he could talk about was this new girl. We were identical, it was clear \u2014 except while I am German-Israeli, she was just German. We look identical.\n\nShe was so cool! Look at her cats? He was always texting her, talking about her, telling me about her life and showing me photos she sent him. It creeped me out. I let him know that. He shrugged it off. One day in a bad bout of IUD pain, after I got it removed in the ER, he took alcohol out of my fridge to go see her. Told me I was paranoid and left me in so much pain on the couch I could barely move. \n\nWe broke up. Guess what country he flew to days later? And who he was officially dating shortly thereafter?\n\nOh, naive me figured she had no clue, so, I messaged her. Two Germans in America, lets be up-front \u2014 girl code and just some mutual bonding as Germans trapped abroad? I figured she would want to know - not because I expected her to break up with him (I\u2019m not that naive), just so at minimum, she could keep an eye on him. \n\nGirl flipped out on me. She was in on it the entire time. \n\nWe live in the same building. I still get pissed every time I see them. But I hate him. I was so happy when I finally broke up with him, he was so controlling and generally an awful person \u2014 he once told me he \u201cliked to start arguments so he could be right\u201d \u2014 like, duh, nothing about the relationship was worth preserving. She can have him. My life has gotten so much better in the months without him, despite COVID \u2014 actually 2020, even with COVID, has been much better than years past for me. He cried over our breakup, I made brownies and adopted my dog (was already in the plans before the breakup, ha). I didn\u2019t cry once over him \u2014 I was so manipulated by that point, i was just happy to suddenly be free. \n\nI have struggled for months trying to figure out why they piss me of and this is why. I am very over him \u2014 we all have exes we aren\u2019t over but that is NOT how I feel about him. That feeling is very different. He disgusts me \u2014 but that\u2019s why \u2014 I am very not over the betrayal. And honestly, there is no reason for me ever to be. It doesn\u2019t get to me, they just annoy the shit out of me. \n\nShe\u2019s afraid of me now though, so I\u2019ll take it. She saw me in the hallway not too long ago and apologized and ran away, I laughed. It was so bizarre.",

And it sucks! Because I want to trust my sister completely. I live her, but she sometimes annoys me too. I just don't want to feel like my sister might abandon me, because she would never do that. It's just that my stupid trust issues make everything worse! But I'm proud of OP. And it's totally ok to cut out her moms side of the family and deny them any contact to her child. The stepsister and exfiance are assholes, but the parents are even worse by rugsweeping everything. If that guy didn't beg OP not to leave him, she could have found real happiness way sooner without the extra emotional damage. Sometimes Family can be just awful. Better cut them out sooner instead of later.",

Ditto the wedding- your mum again chose Kelly over you. And your mum and step dad are two separate people- she was able to come without him and she essentially felt her stepdaughter was more important than someone she grew in her womb and who was the betrayed party.\n\nAs others suggest, I think mum and step dad resent your ongoing feelings as it makes them face up to the damage they\u2019ve done other people in the past. It\u2019s easier to call you unreasonable and painting you as the problem than to accept responsibility for their past actions. \n\nHowever, if they really want contact with the baby, the ball is in their court- they still could prioritise your feelings and ask Kelly and Ryan to move out etc etc, but the fact that they still expect you to do all the accommodation of the betrayal tells you who they really are.",

Your stepsister sounds like manipulative bitch and your ex is spineless man... you did well cutting those toxic elements out of your life.\n\nEnjoy your family (husband and kid) and the other people that supported you and remove the rest. The \"snakes\" (Kelly/Ryan) will poison everyone around them and probably still trying to make you look bad... maybe your mother might see the light some day but to be honest i don't believe it will happen will she's together with your stepdad.\n\nAgain you didn't do anything wrong... so don't beat yourself about it",

If they betrayed you in such a fundamental way once, they won't hesitate to do it again. \n\nAs an aside, I think Ryan is a big fat wanker. Nit only did he cheat with your SISTER, he kept a secret and wasn't man enough to own up to his own behavior. Who would even WANT someone like that? \n\nAs for your family, they either respect your boundaries or can GTFO. It's as simple as that. They have no right to tell you how to feel or how to act in this situation. If they continue to text and berate you, then give each of them ONE warning: if they continue to disrespect your boundaries, they're cut off. They can come back when they learn to respect your boundaries AND demonstrate consistently they can actually do so. \n\nCongratulations on your marriage and pregnancy, btw!",

            "comment": "Question: what are the *positive* effects in your life as a result of maintaining those relationships? If you\u2019re struggling to think of any...you might want to seriously consider going full no contact. \n\nI know there\u2019s this deeply engrained idea that family is soooo important. But honestly? Families are a lottery. They\u2019re who you end up surrounded by through default, not choice. \n\nYou are not required to keep pouring your efforts and energy into any relationship that consistently and predictably harms you, regardless of who it is with. You don\u2019t *owe* them. If anything, you\u2019ve overpaid and now entitled to reap the benefits of healing that come with putting yourself and your husband and your child *first*. If your fam is \u201cjumping ship now, they were never on board\u201d. \n\nThis *should* be one of the most joyous, happy celebrations in your life! Is that what these people are making you feel? Or, through their selfishness and dysfunction, are they taking what ought to be a momentous and wonderful occasion for you and making it stressful and fraught? \n\nThere are patterns to relationships, roles people play. The words in the script might be different, but the story and the characters are the same. Every time we assume our standard role in family conflict, we can expect the standard story to play out and will wind up with the standard outcome. It\u2019s not a conscious thing but it happens. If you want to change the story, change your role. If you find yourself having the same discussion over and over, and the result is always the same, then (not necessarily through any fault of your own) it means you\u2019re playing out the same role. People lose their minds when you stop doing what they\u2019re used to you doing (even when they claim not to like that thing) because it makes the outcome for them less predictable. And they will say and do anything they can in order to force you to reassume your old role. It makes things safer for them, predictable again. If you do start minimizing contact or even cut it off, expect that. Don\u2019t give in, but expect it.",

In fact, they've worked pretty hard to rub it in your face almost constantly. Well, it worked! Their strategy to make you feel like shit for what was done to you has worked and you felt like shit. It has now festered and become resentment, as such feelings usually progress unless the *victimizers* do something to make amends.\n\nDear op, you are perfectly normal for feeling like you do.\n\nI also don't think I've ever heard of another man quite as noodle-spined as Ryan. Your step-sister was major shitstain, but at least she was honest about it, and after Ryan's inability to break up with you - and blaming you for it as if he doesn't have a will of his own - I don't understand why she'd want him anyway. Apparently neither does she at this point, judging from your intel reports on the state of their union.\n\nYou obviously dodged a bullet with Sir Noodle-Spine. He didn't deserve you and Sister Shitstain is truly enjoying the fruits of her labour.\n\nI doubt relations with your mom's side can be salvaged. It's good you have your dad's side. Sounds like stepmom is gonna be a better granma than your own mom could ever be. \n\nKnow that it's A-OK to set and enforce boundaries. Like \"No, mom. I'm over Noodle-Spine, and I'm much better off with husband than I would have been with him. But even though I'm over being treated badly, you - my family - tried to teach me that I should accept being treated badly, and you have never backed down from that. Accepting abuse and being treated badly is not a lesson I nor my child ever need to be taught, so since you guys still insist it's okay to treat me badly, I and mine will have nothing to do with you. Goodbye.\"\n\nBe strong. Don't cave to their ridiculous doubling-down. You got this &lt;3",

In that group there are 3 girls (all 19) but one specifically, let's call her A, is the one I really like. But the problem is that I don't know how to talk to her, we've been texting about things and people in our classes, and sometimes we briefly talk about life, and she always laughs and chats with me, so I don't how to approach her and try to flirt with her, because we really enjoy each others company and we also tease each other, so I want to take a things a bit further being a bit cautious with what I'm doing.\n\nSo is the best way to just to tell her and see what she says?\r  \n\r  \nReddit, i need your advice and let's transform this into a success story.",

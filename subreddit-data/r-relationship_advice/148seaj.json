    "postText": "So my gf of 3 years often says thing about me when talking with coworkers or friends that don\u2019t quite sit right. What\u2019s worse is, she does it right in front of me. Maybe that\u2019s not worse, idk. And maybe I\u2019m giving her the benefit of the doubt since I love her so much, but a lot of her behavior falls into what I can only see as a grey area of disrespect. \nFor example, we were hanging out with a group of our friends in their apartment and somehow started talking about my job. I work at a library so it\u2019s not the most thrilling environment and I\u2019ll often come home and say it was a slow or boring day. But instead of saying I have a boring job, she tells our friends that I\u2019m boring. And then she tried to turn it into a compliment or a good thing somehow by saying \u201cbut I need that in my life\u201d or something like that. She\u2019s said I\u2019m boring not just in front of our friends, but in front of our ballroom dance instructors. When I saw my instructors face after my GF said I was boring, she made a face like \u201cdid you really just say that?\u201d and I felt awful, like I was insulted and couldn\u2019t even realize it until someone else got involved.\n\nAt these ballroom lessons she\u2019ll also constantly tell me \u201cyou smell like sh*t\u201d or \u201cyour breath smells like sh*t\u201d \nAnd she\u2019s not quiet about it. She says it loud enough that other instructors and groups can definitely hear. I mean there are nicer ways of telling me I don\u2019t smell great, and I try my best to smell as nice as possible but I do sweat an excessive amount and she\u2019s known this since day one. If I drive for 15 mins to our dance lesson, I\u2019ll have giant pit stains even if I crank the AC. Believe me, nobody wants to smell bad, and I am constantly correcting my potential odor. Does she really think I need a reminder that I am sweating and starting to smell? Yeah, like I don\u2019t know that already. \n\nAnother example: we were checking out at the grocery store and she grabbed a little snack/candy from the shelf in the register aisle. She put it on the belt along with the other groceries. Then, I decide I want a candy too, so I grab one (green apple licorice) and throw it on the belt. She looked at me and said \u201cno, you\u2019re not getting that\u201dand grabbed it out of my hand and put it back on the shelf.\nThat really rubbed me the wrong way, especially since I always pay for groceries. Why are you allowed to dictate what I can buy? \nSo I said back to her \u201cwhy not? I didn\u2019t say anything about your snack\u201d \nShe replied \u201cGreen apple is disgusting and so is licorice\u201d\n\u201cWhat if I like green apple? I like licorice\u201d \nShe finally gave in \u201cok fine then\u201d\n\nThis last example hurts maybe the worst. So I have always expressed my desire and enjoyment I get from giving oral sex. My GF likes it too, and I offer it by itself oftentimes (no sex, no work on her part and overall an easier experience for her.) \nShe rarely ever rejected my offers, and when she did, she would let me down easy, like \u201csorry babe I\u2019m just too tired\u201d or something like that.\nBut the last time I offered, she said \u201cGod, no.\u201d The tone in her voice was just awful and it made me feel like absolute dog crap. And she saw my face change and then tried to amend her phrasing. \nIf my GF offered me oral sex and I said no for ANY reason, she\u2019d think I was cheating on her or that I don\u2019t love her or I\u2019m not attracted to her. Why should I think differently?\nAnd the bedroom is a whole other story. I can rarely ever touch her (affectionately, not just sexually) without risking my hand being violently swatted away like I\u2019m some pest that landed on her. It makes my feel like nothing but an annoyance. She wasn\u2019t always this way either. She used to be much more open to my offers of affection. Now, I\u2019ve just about given up trying to touch her when I want to touch her. I can only touch her when she takes my hand and places it on her. I\u2019d rather not be rejected by the person I love most, so I\u2019ll suck it up and not make an attempt to touch her. It kills me (really) to not touch her. But it also kills me to be rejected by her, so I\u2019d rather not dig myself two graves. \nFor this reason, I find it horribly difficult to initiate sex. Thus, we only have sex when she wants to. \n\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned, you should have your SO\u2019s back, no matter what. You should always be talking them up like they\u2019re the greatest thing in the world. I do that every chance I get. But it really feels to me like she doesn\u2019t have my back when she says stuff like that. I would NEVER DARE tell my GF she \u201csmells like sh*t\u201d or say her job is boring. I would never dare say anything I would find even mildly insulting to her in public or around friends. But it seems to me she doesn\u2019t think this way. \nIt makes me feel like she doesn\u2019t love me . How could you say these things about the person you\u2019re supposed to love the most?",

Either call her out when she is being mean to you and tell her you would like her to stop. Or move on and find someone who actually likes you.\n\nSome people love books and a library can be a really rewarding place to work, I think that saying something is boring as a blanket statement is quite dismissive. In my opinion, people who can't see beyond their own interests and have no respect for other's interest are themselves boring.\n\nWhy do you think you deserve to be treated poorly by your SO?",

And then you call me boring. LAMO! you\u2019re pretty disrespectful too apparently. \nAnd I\u2019ll be sure to open up less about the full circumstances about my health conditions.

To insult me about my hyperhidrosis, is no different in principle than insulting a person with any medical condition about that condition.

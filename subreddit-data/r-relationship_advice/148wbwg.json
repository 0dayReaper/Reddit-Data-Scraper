    "postText": "Hi all, I guess this is going to be a different one then usually but here goes.\n\nBit of background information, my partner (23) and I (26) have been together for 5 years, always ups and downs but it happens. I'm starting film school next year, basically my goal is I want to write film scripts. Lately I've lost my passion for it, have ideas to develop but whenever I get free time I'm always either exhausted or spending time my girlfriend/family/friends.\n\nSomething I've been thinking about doing is booking a hotel and going out to town for a night on my own so I can spend time working on my story. There's several quiet old school bars/jazz clubs I love being in as they help me relax and inspire my work. The issue would be my partner. \n\nI want to make very clear that I do not have any intention of going out to cheat on my partner. She's my soul mate and I love her with all my heart; that and cheating broke up my parents marriage when I was 10 so I hate the idea of cheating. My partner also knows how I feel about that but I'm sure if I turned around and told her what I wanted she would get suspicious. The reason why I don't want her to come is we are polar opposites in town. I like quiet places and she prefers clubbing. The last time we went out with my friends I suggested we go to a quiet bar but in front of all my friends said that it's the worst bar and boring as fuck and that we should go to a club she liked. There's so many cool places I would love to go but she doesn't want to go with me to them. Even if she went with me to the hotel while I try to work she would whinge we're not having fun and start to annoy me while I work. \n\nThe other thing is if I told her she would no doubt feel left out that im having a night out without her. She usually goes out with her friends every weekend (I never complain or feel left out because I dont want to tag along for a girls night) but anytime I go out to a friend's place or out with a friend she pretty much tags along all the time. Another thing is she tends to worry about me if I go out with people. Basically I've lost a few siblings in the last 10 years so I have sometimes gotten down and bingedrink (and suicidal). I don't drink much these days and doing better in life than I was years ago but she's the sort that'd worry too much then get too clingy to the point I don't get any time to myself. \n\nI don't want to lie to her about it, or start an argument just so I can walk off and do it. But I know even if I reasonably try to explain it to her she'll get mad or upset.\n\nAny ideas? Much appreciated \n\nTLDR I want a night out to myself without my girlfriend but don't want it to ruin our relationship",

I get that sometimes a person just wants some time to themselves and if it helps with inspiration for your passion then why not?  You can always have a night out with g/f the following week - or revisit a cool place you found when you were on one of your own nights out.\n\nAnswer her questions in the same way you have told us about them?  If she gets mad or upset I don't think you're going to be able to explain it to her because she's not going to see it in any way that you can explain.",

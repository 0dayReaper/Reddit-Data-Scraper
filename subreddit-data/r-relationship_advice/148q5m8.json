    "postText": "for context i (f21) and my boyfriend (m20) have literally been together less than a month!!! we have been speaking for 2/3 months and the relationship has moved very fast since he came home from his last deployment (military).   \nour relationship was literally perfect and everything seemed wonderful, so when he told me he had a lads holiday coming up that was booked before we were together i was completely supportive of him going because i had no reason to stress.   \nhe is home now and we argued a bit whilst he was away for the first couple of days - a lot of that is on me and was my fault as i didn\u2019t expect to feel so nervous when he started going out. i of course trust him otherwise i wouldn\u2019t have gotten into the relationship but something was just not right. we have since argued and he eventually told me that he thought about cheating on me when he was away. he told me it was a night we were arguing and he just didn\u2019t want that relationship at the time i guess. he said he didn\u2019t act on it and left the bar to go to another bar shortly after having the thought.   \nlater in the conversation other things came up and it turns out that he had told a few lies when we first met - nothing major, just things that you do not need to be lying about, especially when the things happened before i was even in his life.   \ni feel really calm about it now so maybe i\u2019m not doing the story justice but i keep bursting into tears and feeling like i can\u2019t carry the relationship on.   \ni feel as though our relationship is now tainted by the lies he first told and that the foundations of the whole relationship are essentially nullified now that it has all come to light. the thought that he wanted to cheat on me makes me feel physically sick and he can\u2019t explain why he felt that way so i\u2019m left wondering alone. were they prettier? skinnier? more fun?   \ni\u2019ve never been a massively insecure person but i can\u2019t stop doubting myself and him after it all.   \nhe says he\u2019ll do anything to get my trust back but i just can\u2019t see a way through. how can i possibly trust someone who has been lying through the whole of the short relationship!   \ni can\u2019t tell if i\u2019m overthinking or overreacting but i feel like i\u2019ve been slapped in the face and i just never expected any of it and i dont know how to move forward. i completely adore this boy and held him in the highest regard and now i want to vomit when i think of him because i immediately picture him lusting after someone else and lying about it.   \nplease help  \nTLDR: boyf went on a lads holiday and told me he wanted to cheat. also lied at the start of our relationship and now i feel as though everything is a lie and i am sad.",

This could either mean he's ready to be utterly honest (to a fault) or that he wants you to feel guilty that he missed out on an opportunity because of you. At any rate, it's still VERY early in this relationship and you can't really know yet if he's worth holding on to. Maybe just see how things go before you decide to stay or run.",

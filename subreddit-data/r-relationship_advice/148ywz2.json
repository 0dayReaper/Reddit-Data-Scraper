    "postText": "My boyfriend  is on a tour. He likes to meet and mingle with  people on the way so he ends up talking with this girl on the plane, have food together and exchange numbers (He said he had to borrow some money and paid her back  through her number,  hence the number exchange). They were supposed to go in different directions. This is day 1.\n\nDay 2 she calls him and says she'll be where he is on day 3. They plan to meet and he spends time with her and her friends on Day 3. He is to continue with the trip on Day 5, the girl knows that and asks for a 'parting meeting' on Day 4. He goes to where she is and meets her, says his goodbye. He is now continuing with the tour. \n\nThese encounters he has on his tours make me uncomfortable but I've always thought that's I being jealous. I am OK for this encounter except for that last meeting. They just spent time a day before, was a 'parting meeting' called for??? What kinda bond was created that a farewell meeting had to be done? When confronted, he said 'I went cause she called, she lived next street. We just met for 5 minutes and said farewell. It's all a part of the journey to me, that's it.' \n\nIs it just that? Am i being uncomfortable for no reason? I find myself doubting everything he's said now. Please help.",

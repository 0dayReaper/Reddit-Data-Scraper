    "postText": "I was dating my ex for about 11 months.  During that time, we were never public for multiple different reasons that she had.  She never wanted to claim me or be public because she has a son from a previous relationship and she didn\u2019t want to bring someone new into his life unless it was serious which I understood.  Fast forward a few months, she knew I was serious about her and us and her reasoning for not being public was now \u201cshe needs to heal from her past relationships\u201d which I, again, understood and just wanted her to give her time because I loved her.  Nearing the end of our relationship, she got a new position at her job and started hanging out with her co workers a lot on her days off which I was iffy on cuz she had already started distancing herself from me recently.  We went from seeing each other 2-3 times a week to maybe once a month.  I know I should\u2019ve left long before all of this but I did love her and wanted a future with her.  Over the course of those 11 months, her family practically took me in.  I moved away from my family for school and have been living by myself since then.  My ex would come to my work a lot with her mom and aunt and they love me as if I was their own.  Fast forwarding again to last month, I went on vacation with my mom and sister and the day I left, my ex said she was going out with an old friend and I had nothing to worry about and I trusted her.  2 days into my vacation, she tells me she slept with him.  I don\u2019t know how I found it in me, I wish I didn\u2019t but I said I would try to forgive her.  Apparently the guy she cheated with gave her an STD too and the weeks leading up to her getting her results, she was stressing and I was asking her what she wanted to do regarding him because if he was staying, I was going.  She told me if the test came back positive (it did), she wanted nothing to do with him.  Then we stopped talking for a few days because I wanted to give her space.  During those days, I started talking to someone else at my job. Me and my ex weren\u2019t technically together at this point and the opportunity came up for me and I went on a date with the girl. I told my ex the day before and she was upset because admittingly, I told her terribly. We talked about it the morning of, fought a little bit but overall we agreed that this is an opportunity for me and I should take it.  I saw her later that day at my job, gave her a quick hug and went about my day.  That night, I saw on her story of her out with another guy.  After a little digging, I found out it was the guy she cheated with. At first, I was laughing but after a few days went by and it finally sunk in the shit she just pulled on me, I was heartbroken.  I gave her everything she wanted.  In her words, I was perfect but she still left me for someone who gave her an std. I didn\u2019t talk to her for a few more days until she texted me asking if we were good and I snapped.  I told her how hurt and disrespected I felt because I feel like our relationship was a lie.  I asked her what I did wrong and she said nothing, I did nothing wrong.  I asked why does he get everything I\u2019ve been waiting for for almost a year in less than a week.  I don\u2019t even think I got an answer for that.  I asked why she is choosing him over me if that\u2019s the case.  All I got from that was maturity(now thinking about it, I thought she meant my maturity but based on her last relationships and how her new dude looks and from she told me prior, it\u2019s her maturity who wasn\u2019t enough.  She wasn\u2019t ready for a relationship that I was gonna give her.). I was so pissed off that night and said somethings I don\u2019t regret but probably shouldnt have.  After everything, I still promised to keep her family, mainly her mom, out of it because she \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d we were in a relationship(her mom caught us cuddling on multiple occasions, her mom isn\u2019t stupid). That happened a few weeks ago and I\u2019ve seen her mom and her aunt lots of times and it hurts because I love her family but I need to distance myself in order for me to heal but her mom asked me what was wrong and I somewhat told her but I never said it was her daughter that is the reason for my suffering.  I\u2019ve seen multiple posts of my ex and her new man and her son and it hurts because that should be me.  I really wanna tell her mom everything for probably malicious intent that I don\u2019t wanna admit but also to see if I can keep that relationship with them even though they know what her daughter did.  I\u2019m going crazy and hurting because I\u2019m alone(date with other girl went good, just wasn\u2019t working) and she is happy with her walking disease.  I hope her relationship works out for her so she left me for a good reason but I\u2019m praying it doesn\u2019t and he hurts her and she constantly thinks about what she gave up for it.  It sounds bad but I\u2019m hurting and I want her to hurt too but I don\u2019t know how to go nuclear with this.  Is telling her mom a good way on ending this chapter in my life or is it going too far?\n\nRSlash, if you\u2019re reading this, I love your videos and please go but don\u2019t go hard on me.  I\u2019ll be listening ;).  Hello from Canada.",

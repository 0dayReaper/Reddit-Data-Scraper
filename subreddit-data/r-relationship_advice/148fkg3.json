    "postText": "\nWhen my husband has something that bothers him at work or some other minor issue that upsets him, he comes home and starts random fights with me. He also acts really dramatic when he\u2019s angry. Two examples this week are:\n\nWe were at the airport and some man told him he would need to check his carry on because there wasn\u2019t enough room. Instead of being just kinda silently annoyed like I would, he took a picture of the man and said I want a picture of your face so I can see who is responsible is my bag is lost. Then he proceeded to tell me very loudly \u201cwhat an a-hole\u201d as we were getting on the plane to where everyone could hear.\n\nThen yesterday my dad called and gave me some financial tips. I told my husband about it-who works in financial field-and he said \u201cthat\u2019s not true\u201d and proceeded to explain. So I called my dad and politely said \u201cmy husband thinks this is not true. Can you please double check on that for me?\u201d \n\nMy husband said he was insulted that I asked my dad to double check on the information. I said it\u2019s not that I\u2019m saying he needs to fact check you-I\u2019m just saying it as a polite way to suggest he needs to look again. Instead of being like \u201cno dad you are wrong!\u201d My husband said \u201cno you just only see things from your point of view is the problem. And you don\u2019t give a crap about anything I say. You only care about yourself.\u201d\n\nThis pisses me off because I don\u2019t understand why he seems to think so negatively of my reactions all the time. I don\u2019t mean it in a brag way but most people say I am the most kind considerate person they\u2019ve met. Honestly it bothers me my husband seems to think I\u2019m somehow so selfish. I had a talk about this with him and how I feel like I have to walk on eggshells sometimes with my wording. And he just got defensive instead of listening to me. Then acts like nothing happened. Now I find myself kind of turned off by him with all of the memories of \u201cbad behavior\u201d. Why does he do this??",

We don't know what your husband does or how he is feeling so we wont be able to answer why this is happening. Counselling is always an option but I have a feeling he might feel to proud. \n\nIs his work particularly stressful? Do they carry grudges for long times? Do they have a healthy way to release stress (e.g. sport, gym, art)? \n\nAlso maybe this is normal in his family possibly, does he inherit traits from them?",

You are just trying to change it up now because you realize you look bad now!\u201d It\u2019s a pattern. \n\nHis parents are very close to him and live down the road. I have talked to them about some of his anger problems and they mostly just listen to me, apologize, and then say they don\u2019t know what to do. His mom justifies his behavior. His dad seems a bit more on my side, but doesn\u2019t ever say anything. But he was listening to the whole airport interaction for example and just gave me a look like he knew what I was thinking, but once again said nothing.",

Sometimes abusers wait until their partner is \"locked in\" (via marriage, kids etc) before they start to slowly show you who they really are. \n\nYou need to think good and hard if it's really worth staying with someone who you can't relax around and who embarrasses you constantly with his anger in public.",

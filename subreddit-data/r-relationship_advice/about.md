Description:

Need help with your relationship? Whether it's romance, friendship, family, co-workers, or basic human interaction: we're here to help!

Rules:

Posts must contain a title, description, TLDR, &amp; basic info like ages, genders, relationship length: All posts must contain a title, a description of the problem, a TLDR and basic information such as ages, genders, relationship length. One or two line posts or those simply posing a question to the community are not allowed.

All posts must request advice on a specific situation between two or more people: No submissions *giving* advice, no links, no YouTube videos, no hypotheticals, no adverts, no spam. Posts must feature a question that you want specifically answering. 

We are here for you to ask a *specific question* for a *specific relationship issue* you have *right now, in this moment.* (IE: "What do I do?" "I need advice!" or questions about past/hopeful future relationships would not be allowed.)

No Moral Judgment Requests: Moral Judgement Requests are asking people to evaluate actions taken or that you want to take in the context of right, wrong, selfish or not selfish. Using questions like 

"Am I right/wrong?"

"Am I overreacting?"

"Is this selfish?"

"Would this be okay?"

"Am I the asshole?"

"AITA?" 

"Is this normal?"

"Is this weird/unusual/inappropriate?" 

"Who is right here?" 

are all examples of a moral judgement and will be automatically removed.

Things This Sub Can't Give Advice On:: Rants, unsolicited advice, letters to an ex, "body counts" or number of sexual partners, mental health issues, medical health issues, legal problems, financial problems, any situations involving minors (under 18 regardless of local laws), and any situations involving abuse (violence, sexual, emotional etc). All of these will be removed and locked.

Only One Update Is Allowed: You can submit **one** update post at any time after 48 hours has past from the original post. 

Additional advice may be requested in new posts but they may not be continuations of the orignal one. E.g. no titles saying "Update 2" or "Update 4". We're not a blog. Please post further updates on your own profile.

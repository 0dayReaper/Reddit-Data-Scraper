    "postText": "A bit of background my girlfriend and I are 30 and 31 respectively. We have been dating for about a year. I work as a high-level engineer at a good firm and my girlfriend works as a payroll specialist at a good firm too. I make significantly more than her (3x).\n\nThings were good in our relationship until I showed her my retirement/savings. She now doesn't see the point of working and has started framing our relationship in that, she is the beautiful one and that I am the nerdy engineer that was lucky to have her. Before, when we met she was all about making it her own way, eventually starting her own company with her sister in sourcing and recruiting. But now she jokes about driving a Range Rover and wearing Lululemon and going to Yoga.\n\nWe were having a discussion again about this 'trophy wife' stuff she brought up that I was nerdy back in the day while she was very popular. I told her she is not a trophy wife, that yes she is attractive but its not a huge difference between us.\n\nI told her had it been the case that I met her when she was 22 and I was my current age than sure, but she isn't 22 anymore. After I said that she just started crying like crazy.\n\nShe started saying that I think of her as ugly and used up that her best years are behind are. She just told me that if I am not happy to be with her, why am I even here? to stop wasting her time.\n\nI tried to talk to her but she was in no state for a conversation. I don't know what to say, guys, for me, I just wanted to say that I think we are of similar attractiveness. Like I don't think anyone when they see us turns their head and is like oh she is with him the cause of money? Or damn he is so lucky to be with her. I think it's mutual. She was the one that if anything went after my attractiveness first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat should I do? I like the fact that we both work and I don't want to change that dynamic. And I don't want her to think too that she is above me that I am so lucky to have her. I want her to think of us as equals and in my attempt to do that I hurt her feelings. What's the next move?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Tl;Dr- ever since my girlfriend found out about my savings she has more often entertained the idea of being a stay at home wife. She has tried to bring up the fact that she was more attractive than me as justification why I am so lucky to be with her and why I should accept this.**",

            "comment": "This seems to be a very textbook case of psychological projection. Because of your discrepancy in salary, she likely feels like she is worth less than you. She likely feels like her best years are behind her, seeing as you took off and are only going up. Her poking around about her being a trophy wife is her seeking validation that she is not worthless and that you still value her, and her financial contributions are nothing to be ashamed of. I don\u2019t think she is a gold digger, I think she is taking some hits on her self esteem (through no fault of your/ her own). I think some counselling would go a long way here.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your awards and replies. I appreciate the recognition :) There is a lot to unpack for both the OP and his girlfriend in this situation; but the point is that is *worth* unpacking. Cheers!",

Of course no partner should be more important than the other but I think compliments where you put yourself to the side and really treat your partner like a king/queen is super sweet. Maybe the 'equal' aspect can be taken a little too seriously? I think it can get in the way because it can prevent you from complimenting your partner in a way that you, yourself, wouldn't compliment yourself. Or maybe you could get worried about inflating your partner's ego/confidence? Which... wouldn't you want your partner to feel super special and confident in the relationship?",

I never thought the world revolves around me or that other people weren\u2019t the main characters of their own lives, but my parents spoiled me with compliments about how smart I was, how successful I\u2019d be, etc and I believed them.\n\nAfter going to a good college from a small high school (120ish students) I realized very quickly that it was more of a \u2018big fish in a small pond\u2019 in high school and \u2018big fish is a pond with many other big fish\u2019 in college. That\u2019s when I started thinking existentially and realized I never had any predetermined assurance of success and that I\u2019d have to work just as hard as others to succeed. That I\u2019m just a nobody to anyone but my family and that everyone (generally) is a nobody.\n\nSince then, my depression and anxiety have gotten worse, I procrastinate more, I dread my future and I have a constant worry that I\u2019ll be a failure/that I won\u2019t actually end up successful as I was always told as a kid. I\u2019ll be working a 9-5 at some job that isn\u2019t exceptionally fulfilling or enjoyable just like everyone else. :(\n\nI\u2019m glad I\u2019ve had 3 years to ruminate about this epiphany.

It sounds like she has a good job and while some women may have been a bit more attractive in their early 20s than early 30s... a lot of early 30s women are still gorgeous? Still gorgeous, PLUS a more stable career, and more emotionally mature (well, except OP's gf). That's way more than what a lot of women 10 years younger have.\n\nHis gf sounds like she just wants someone to support her and gush about how \"lucky\" they are.\n\nEdit: as a woman I know that society places too much value on our looks. It sucks big time. Frankly, I know a lot of women 30+, and 40+, that are drop dead gorgeous. They don't have the **exact** same youthful look as they did in their early 20s but still so beautiful and their confidence is awe inspiring.",

I have missed out so much on life mostly due to my depression and just generally hating myself and feeling trapped in a body that constantly works against me (I have some health problems and have struggled with my weight since I was about 15 and it's only gotten worse). I'm almost 30 and it feels like all I've accomplished is getting married. I have to remind myself that there is still time, life is not over and I can still accomplish things.

In some ways this era is better for teenagers, they aren't half as wild as we were. \n\nMy daughter is great, but I think many young women (and men) feel like they have to look perfect, we never had filters in my day. \n\nI'm not sure where you have got this opinion from, but I feel like it's the younger women who aren't valued, or rather valued for the wrong thing.

I don't think I've ever loved a decade more than my 50's.  My children are on their own. I am healthy, I have a great job making good money.  I travel, I have time to learn new things, and I've taken up new hobbies. On top of all this, I've been married to the same amazing man for 35 years.  So what if I am 20 lbs heavier than in my younger days?  I am curvier, more interesting, and I know what I want from life.  I think that makes me more attractive than any insecure 30 year old who cries because they aren't a \"trophy wife\".  Why would anyone aspire to be a trophy?",

So many people in this sub are quick to say \u201cTHIS PERSON IS CRAZY LEAVE THEM.\u201d But relationships can be deeper than that. In her early 30\u2019s she\u2019s probably starting to confront aging like I feel a lot of women do. I am at 33. It doesn\u2019t help that my boyfriend is 26 and it can be a reminder. He also just got out of college and will no-doubt make more than me. I think OP needs to sit his girlfriend down and have some serious conversation about responsibilities and reality and what is expected in this relationship. I can see how maybe his girlfriend took him bringing up age as a bad thing since most of the women I know, if already upset, will twist something like this and not on purpose. He only mentioned an age gap. Not that her age makes her less attractive by the idea of \u201ctrophy wives\u201d does usually mean a much younger woman. This is also another reason why, IMO, it\u2019s important to leave money out of the equation until much later in a relationship. Best relationships I\u2019ve ever been in money was never discussed and people took care of their own crap. Money is a nightmare to fight over and can get some people all out of sorts.",

Maybe op's tone was really bad when talking about ageing and that was upsetting. Or maybe we're all human and sometimes it takes a bit after being told off to cool down, thoughtfully evaluate what you were told, and decide to make changes. \n\nI think at least one more chance is warranted. If she's able to work through this and move forward. Then great! If not, well she had her chance to grow and decided not to. I think that's reasonable enough to look elsewhere after that.",

When she found out that your income created something that SHE wanted to accomplish but is now realizing that she many never get that type of money/success - I think it sent her into a midlife crisis.\n\nHer new perspective demonstrates her desire to be the best at SOMETHING. The Trophy Wife you kind of described above is a new visual successful image to her - she has money, is beautiful, can wear the name brand clothes, do yoga, and has a husband who appreciates her for her looks because she is \u201cpopular\u201d.\n\nThese examples show that she wants to be appreciated and successful in some aspect of her life. I think she is going the superficial route because she feels like she hasn\u2019t achieved the success she wanted at her age, she isn\u2019t as financially successful as you, her job has probably peaked in salary, and she needs to feel needed / appreciated / and better than you in some way.",

She realized that while she has been trying to make her way, she is so far behind you in terms of retirement  savings that it can be a bit self defeating - it is a hard pill to swallow.  I suspect you been making significantly more money than her for the entirety of your working careers and you will continue to do so.  Also, a vast majority of your earning years have been during a bull market so you are saving significantly more than her and your savings are growing exponentially greater than hers.  It can be disheartening to compare yourself to the Joneses so to speak.\n\nShe is hitting an age of introspection.  Has she accomplished what she wanted?  What is the future, children, marriage and career.  While, I am taking you at your word that you were trying to explain that you thought you were equals, she is hearing that you are better than her.  I think you were a little too blunt and obtuse in your statement as she is hearing it not as a speech of being equals but as you being better at her at everything.  You believe you are equally attractive, you have a higher paying job, you have more money.  She wanted to start her own business but hasn't and is probably maxed out in earnings potential as a payroll specialist.  She may not see the opportunities that you may have.  That does not been she is any less important - and you need to make that clear in terms she hears.  She is of the age where she is probably looking at her future and what she has and has not accomplished.  \n\nWhen I got engaged, I was making at least twice what my then girlfriend (now wife) was making.  I came from a middle class background and was without any needs.  My wife grew up poor and had to make her own way.  We had a lot of conversations about money, that she would stay home with the kids, and about spending expectations (my wife still wants a Lexus - but still drives a minivan, we will be married 20 years in November).    When we were married it was our income, and our home and our money.  But our expectations is what mattered.  When we got married my wife wanted the Lexus, she still does, but she also understands that she might not get everything from her want list until a few years down the road.  Instead of seeing this as her wanting you to be her provider - find out realistically what her expectations are 5, 10 and 20 years from now.  This will be a better indicator than anything.\n\nThis is not a difficult issue to address.  Sit down and talk.  Tell her that you are happy to revisit this after she has had time to process what she wants to say.  You need to tell her you have that same right as well.  But you are going to have to talk to her.",

I don\u2019t necessarily think having a \u201ctrophy wife\u201d means the guy is ugly or even less attractive. If anything a \u201ctrophy wife\u201d is derogatory about the women - she\u2019s super attractive but she\u2019s an air-head. She was probably already petrified that he will leave her for a 22 year old and he even brought it up himself!\n\nHer switch from being more career focused to marriage focused probably reflects the time of her life. The dude needs to ask her if she wants a family and children. Even if she has said no in the past she may have completely changed her position on that. Men can find this perplexing but it is the old \u201cbiological clock\u201d issue, women only have a certain amount of good child bearing years and once 30 hits lots of women re-evaluate what they want in life.  If he doesn\u2019t want that he is wasting her time.",

You were trying to say you were equals, but maybe in trying to get that message across it was interpreted as you thinking she wasn't attractive. From her side, her trophy wife jokes might have been an attempt at humour and some fantasy for her which made you feel like what she valued in you, and what you valued in her, was no longer what it had been previously.  \nIf it were me, I'd sit down my partner and explain that you were in no way trying to hurt her feelings. You are very attracted to her physically, and also her personality and that she is independent and hard-working. I would also softly let her know that her jokes about her being a trophy wife and you being the \"nerdy one who makes the money\" made you feel like she thought she was more attractive than you, that you were a mismatched pair, and that all you brought to the relationship was your money. Emphasize that you appreciate the partnership you both have built in all aspects: financially, physically, and emotionally.  \nHopefully this will show her that you did not mean to hurt her feelings, just as she hopefully wasn't trying to hurt yours, and you can both move on from this stronger than before.",

WARNING! \n\nYour two fatal errors were: we\u2019re similar in attractiveness, and you\u2019re not 22 any more. You made the mistake of chasing the enemy onto its home turf. To imagine how this feels to her, imagine you lost your job and got one where you make 1/3 as much as she does, and when you tried to reassure yourself that your contributions were still valuable, she made a crack like, \u201cMaybe when you were earning X, but you\u2019re not making that any more.\u201d It probably really stung. \n\nSo much for the superficial stuff.  \n\nAs for the substantive stuff: I\u2019m pretty and you\u2019re a nerd, so I get special treatment. (For perspective, I\u2019m pretty and my husband is a nerd too.) I would not put up with that shit for one hot minute. I wouldn\u2019t respect my husband if he did. What is this supposed to be, a lifetime of you treating her worshipfully for deigning to be with you??\n\n An easy answer would be, I\u2019m not interested in a trophy wife. I\u2019m not interested in being a sugar daddy. If that\u2019s what you want, we are looking for different things in life. \n\nBut the truth is, she had reasons for choosing you. If she had wanted to choose someone else she would have. So stand up for yourself! You guys are *partners.* Neither of you is indebted to the other. Your partnership depends in both of you wanting to be there. So if she doesn\u2019t want to be there on the merits of the relationship, let her know you\u2019re ready to walk. Then walk!\n\nIf she thinks she\u2019s  pretty and therefore gets special treatment, and you stick around for that, then you get what you deserve.  Maybe you guys need counseling or something so she can hear it, but anyone that childish has no business in a relationship. And there are better women out there.",

            "comment": "My husband is an engineer, and I\u2019m a teacher. He makes way more than I ever will. We joke all the time about me getting to live a life of luxury all because of him. (In reality, I played a large role in his success and our financial stability by putting my career on hold to stay home with our kids so that he could work as late as he needed to, travel for work at the drop of a dime, attend work and networking events in the evenings, not have to worry about the kids or household chores so that he could focus on work, etc, etc.) We joke about him being a nerd (he isn\u2019t) and him being lucky to have me (we are both lucky to have one another). But it\u2019s all a joke and lighthearted. \n\nAre you sure she\u2019s just not joking about it all? If she was, your comment on her appearance probably really stung. She probably started crying when you told her that she wasn\u2019t an attractive 22 year old anymore first because aging is such a double standard in our society. According to this article on  [aging ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5549213/) double standards: \u201c. . . older women are evaluated more negatively than older men, especially because their \u201cmost highly valued social asset, their physical attractiveness\u201d declines whereas men\u2019s \u201cmost valued social resources, their earnings potential increases\u201d So you just reinforced this notion to your girlfriend; she\u2019s getting less attractive and you\u2019re making 3x more money than her AND your income will most likely keep growing. Plus, women are insecure about their looks enough to begin with. That\u2019s a huge burn when someone you love pretty much tells you that you have gotten uglier over the years. \n\nYour girlfriend probably also started crying because she knows that it\u2019s possible that you could go after some 22 year old some day who will gladly get with you just for your money. In our society successful middle aged men - or even older - are often spotted with beautiful young women while older women are rarely spotted with younger men.\n\nIf your girlfriend really is ready to quit working now and you\u2019re not in agreement with it, that\u2019s an issue. But if you two are talking about marriage and/or children down the road, maybe she just realizes that her life could be very different than she had ever imagined. People reprioritize their goals and ambitions throughout life based on how their circumstance change - especially when money is no longer an issue. She hardly seems like a gold digger (as many commenters called her) if she was committed to you before she learned about your savings. \n\nYou need to sit down and talk with her about your future. How will you both contribute - monetary wise or in other ways? What do you expect if you get married and/or have kids? Will you both work? Will one stay home to raise the kids? Will you have a prenup? Will your savings and retirement accounts be shared or will you maintain separate accounts? How will bulls be handled if you do have separate accounts? Just leave appearance out of the conversation.",

She probably thought she was really successful after all the hard work she put in starting her own business, but all those achievements probably feel small to her now, knowing how much you make.\n\n2. She was probably using humor to deal with that insecurity, and you calling her out both ruined the joke and made her come face to face with being insecure.\n\nYou guys need to sit down and have a conversation about expectations and what you want out of the relationship. If she's a great partner you should work to reassure her of her worth to you, and how proud of her you are for her achievements. Honestly, the trophy wife thing sounds like it could be a really funny running gag between you two. If you're both able to get past this, embrace it.",

            "comment": "Why are so many people sooo ready for OTHER people to end relationships with their SO over one or two issues?? The money thing probably DID make her feel insecure. And it also probably made her feel very proud of him... so she wanted to hear he was proud of her... misguided and not in the best of ways. But she probably was merely looking for validation. And what she got was, she doesn\u2019t look as good as she used to. I don\u2019t know anyone who loves their SO who would say that to them. Surely he knew her well enough to know she was looking for affirmation. If he was so sure of his looks then he would be saying that of course she was! Or turn it into a joke and laugh it off. I think sitting down and actually verbalizing the working or not working is what needs to happen. But you need to talk about it, without telling her how attractive you are or that you are both equally attractive. Trophy wives are for old men who have millions and marry 20 year olds!",

Maybe she was joking? \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 makes 3x what I make. We used to constantly joke that I\u2019m going to be his trophy wife or whatever. It\u2019s mostly just us poking fun. During corona, he\u2019s out of work and now I\u2019m the one supporting us both. Now I come home and joke about him not having dinner ready and call him my house husband and he calls me his sugar momma. It\u2019s all in good fun. If he were to make a joke that I\u2019m not pretty enough to be his trophy wife, I\u2019d be pretty hurt. If I were to joke that he\u2019s not clean enough or doesn\u2019t put out enough or whatever to be my sugar baby, he\u2019d be hurt. \n\nSo there\u2019s like a possibility that she\u2019s been joking and took your words that she\u2019s not a trophy wife to mean she\u2019s unattractive. Talk to her. Reassure her that you find her attractive etc. If she\u2019s still focused on being significantly better looking than you or stopping working, run for the hills. It\u2019s also completely possible I\u2019m reading it as joking because my fianc\u00e9 and I joke so much in this manner.\n\nEdit: grammar",

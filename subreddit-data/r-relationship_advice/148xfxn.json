    "postText": "Earlier last week I was staying at my Grandma\u2019s to help her with work. One night my bf asked me if he could get up with me in the morning. I had said no at first because I never accept my boyfriends gestures, but I gave him a chance and said he could wake up early with me. I made it absolutely clear I couldn\u2019t call him while I was getting up and while I was working. \n\nThe next morning we start texting and he immediately starts asking me if we could call. I was clear and explained again that I couldn\u2019t call him, and he told me, \u201cWhyd I even get up?\u201d and \u201cHow do you not have time to acknowledge my existence before you get out of bed.\u201d\n\nWhen I made it to work I expressed I was upset with him and tried to communicate with him but he refused to talk to me because I was \u201carguing.\u201d He then asked again 2 more times if we could call and each time I explained the same thing. I\u2019m at my Grandma\u2019s, I\u2019m here to work not for luxury, and I don\u2019t really have the time or see the point in walking away for 5 seconds to make a call. I explained it to him very clearly several times but each time I would explain it to him he said he couldn\u2019t understand. It\u2019s not like I was refusing to call him, I would call him every night I was there and would even stay up and wait for him to get home at 11pm when I need to get up at 6am. (For reference, I\u2019ve shown our conversation to 5 different people and each say I explained myself clearly.)\n\nHe then told me we need to have a talk about communication because I\u2019m wrong in the ways I explain things and I need to do better. It all made me very upset because everytime I do communicate it\u2019s arguing or it\u2019s not the right way even though I\u2019m being clear. I understand some people need additional help but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case, it feels manipulative. \n\nI asked for a break but ultimately we couldn\u2019t agree and we talked. He came to my work the next day and everything was ok until he asked to look through my phone. I was very transparent and expressed that I had vented to two people and I hadn\u2019t said nice things. I stated with his current mindset I wasn\u2019t comfortable sharing that with him but would show him later. He flipped and begged me to show him my phone, said he would leave if I didn\u2019t, and tried gripping the phone out of my hands. I\u2019ve always let him go through my things even if hesitantly. I never had privacy as a child after dealing with CSA, black mailing, and helicopter parents so it really hits an uncomfortable spot for me, and I\u2019ve explained that to him. He says he just wants to know what I\u2019m up to and share everything with me. I eventually had to just hand him the phone and after looking through it he went to the bathroom and cried for 20 minutes.\n\nA couple days later on one of our dates the topic got brought up again and he starts arguing with me again saying I\u2019m unclear and unreasonable. We had to talk in circles for him to be able to understand why I couldn\u2019t call him (he himself said that\u2019s what we had to do). Near the end he started getting aggressive and beating his head against the steering wheel. It resulted in me crying the whole morning overwhelmed.\n\nI asked him for space the next day and again he flipped. He\u2019s now making false promises and stating that he wants to marry me soon. He\u2019s even saying he\u2019ll do things I asked him to do months ago. I feel like it\u2019s manipulative and he\u2019s trying to trap me in the relationship. I don\u2019t know what to do. Everything is weigjing on me so heavily and I don\u2019t feel like he respects my reasoning. It\u2019s like this with every problem. \n\nI\u2019m willing to provide screenshots if asked. I really need help.",

That's a reasonable, adult boundary.\n\nYou also have the right to privacy. He doesn't have any right to go through your phone.\n\nThe fact that you have said several times that you want a break, and he refuses to acknowledge that is also a bad sign.\n\nI couldn't stay with someone who treated me like this. It wouldn't be \"a break\". I would flat out break up.\n\nUnfortunately, possessive, controlling men do not accept breakups gracefully. You will have to stay strong, and not give him a chance to manipulate you back.",

I don't have any practical advice on breaking up with an abuser so I hope someone can piggyback on this comment. I am not asking you to leave this instant because I know that it is not realistic for you, but I do want to emphasize that leaving him will need to be well considered and the longer you stay in this relationship, the harder it's going to be to extricate yourself. I really hope you're able to get out as quickly as possible.\n\nFor what it's worth, you are absolutely correct when you say you feel manipulated, because it's true. Please remind yourself of that because abuse makes people second guess their true feelings or feel like they somehow deserve to feel that way.\n\nAlso, don't let him see this thread. Abusers can get dangerously violent when they think their victim is about to leave or is seeking help. Delete this from your browser history, your account etc., and please look up \"the cycle of abuse\" when you're safe to do so (I.E, not at risk of him seeing.)",

I know I should leave it\u2019s just really overwhelming. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s going to talk me back into things and I don\u2019t know how to say no. As it stands, if we\u2019re not together or working we\u2019re calling 24/7, even for sleeping or showering. We\u2019re on the phone right now. I am constantly surronded by him due to his overthinking and his insecurities. Everything is really overwhelming due to those factors. It feels great to be around him but the second I have air I feel so terrible and mistreated. I have tried to set boundaries anout how much time we spend together but have ultimately met similar responses to above and given up. We\u2019re approaching our one year on the 24th and that\u2019s really laying heavy on my heart but I know I can\u2019t stand another year of this. I don\u2019t feel like he could be physically aggressive towards me, but I know emotional aggression is just as bad and I need to get out. Thank you for your advice.",

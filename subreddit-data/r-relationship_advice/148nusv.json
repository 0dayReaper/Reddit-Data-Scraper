    "postText": "tldr; we hooked up for several months two years ago and now I want to tell him I regret not dating him but don't know if I should or how. \n\nSo, almost two years ago I started hooking up with this guy. Let's call him FWB. I knew I was interested in him the moment he walked in the door. In bed, things were great. I told him right from the start that I wasn't ready to date anyone at the time, but we had fun going on what we called \"fake dates\". \n\nThe reason I wasn't ready to commit was I was still in contact with my ex and knew I'd see him when I flew home for Christmas. (My ex and I had an amazing relationship and ended things amicably when I moved overseas.) Before this trip I had a conversation with FWB. I don't remember exactly what I said, but basically he knew I was going to hook up with someone while I was traveling. \n\nWhen I returned, things were rekindled with my ex and the \"getting over him\" process started all over again. FWB and I would call each other occasionally, but stopped hanging out. We'd see each other once every few months with mutual friends and things were friendly.\n\nOver the last year and a half I finally lost contact with my ex and I've moved on. I've been out in the dating scene and there's always something missing. Attraction, life goals, intimacy, something always doesn't line up. \n\nFast forward to about two weeks ago. FWB called me out of the blue and said he's in the area and has time. I tell him to come over. We end up chatting for like 3 or 4hrs. The whole time I'm sitting there thinking, oh my god, I'm an idiot. How did I let this person go? He checks all the boxes. \n\nI've messaged him a few times since and he's replied but never kept the conversation going. Looking back, I don't feel good about how things ended and feel like maybe I was a bit of an insensitive asshole. So I understand if he's not interested anymore.\n\nBut I also... Well, I don't want to miss a chance if I have one. Should I offer an apology? Would a well thought out text message be ok? Or should I call him? Should I wait until we see each other somewhere to bring it up? Or should I just leave this guy alone?",

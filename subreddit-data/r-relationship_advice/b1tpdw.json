    "postText": "Throwaway.\n\nThis is an odd thing. Wife and I have been married 20 years. I\u2019ve never suspected her of cheating and our sex life has been outstanding.\n\nFirst of the year, I receive a package in the mail. It\u2019s a DVD addressed to me, and a typed note that says \u201cyour eyes only\u201d. It\u2019s my wife having sex , separately, with three guys. She was younger, much younger, based on body and appearance and hair style it was around the time we were going out\u2014either before, during, or after we were engaged (she grew her hair longer for the wedding and kept it that way).\n\nFirst I\u2019ve no idea who sent it to me other than one of those three guys in the DVD - none of which I know. I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s one of my wife\u2019s ex. Second I\u2019ve know idea why they sent it. Are they trying to say she was screwing around on me? The tape isn\u2019t time stamped so I don\u2019t have a frame of reference. She kept her hair short for years until we were engaged so it could have been during a block of time, certainly before we dated. \n\nAnd also what are they trying to achieve if this was taken before we dated? I know my wife had other partners. Hell I had three times the partners she did before we married but that was 20 years ago I think we\u2019re past that. But apparently this person or persons isn\u2019t.\n\nThe whole thing is strange. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on. I haven\u2019t told my wife, I\u2019m not sure how she would take it. She\u2019s very sexual and adventurous but I don\u2019t think she\u2019d like the idea of her past catching up to her. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get to the bottom of this unless I tell her.\n\nEDIT - update. I\u2019m overwhelmed by the responses. Thank you for your interest.\n\nI did speak to my wife yesterday afternoon. Some mentioned letting her watch it in private and I gave her that option. She did and we talked at length. Some of it is a bit clearer now.\n\nThe two \u201camateur\u201d looking videos are two roommates, taken on the same night. That\u2019s why the camera doesn\u2019t move and that\u2019s why the room is the same.  I asked why the bed looks different and she replied the sheets were a bit messy so they changed them before they had another go. \n\nThe other is a boyfriend she dated when her and I met, before we actually started dating. She knows this man is friends with one of the before mentioned roommates and thinks it\u2019s him who got the three videos together and sent them to us. \n\nWhy?\n\nShe admits that last summer he tried connecting with her on Facebook. When she did he tried to make it sexual again so she stopped. She thinks he sent the DVD to cause an issue with us.\n\nFor the first time I now have doubts. Her answers are logical but seem a bit off to me. And honestly I may be just upset that she did two guys in one night - I know it was 20 years ago but that\u2019s still hard to take call me shallow if you want. Also she didn\u2019t seem shaken by the DVD or the fact I had it, merely irritated that this person sent it. I had the idea she\u2019d rather I didn\u2019t have it but now that I did, oh well. \n\nIt still leaves many questions unanswered, such as why the tapes are from 96-97 and the DVD was made in 2013 but I\u2019m just getting it now? That many be minor but it may be everything. Plus how does this gentleman know where I live - Facebook doesn\u2019t give you that information. Being in contact with someone does so now you see why I have doubts.\n\nThanks to you all for your concern and feedback. I love my wife and cherish her, and her past is her past, but for some reason it\u2019s slapping us in the face right now. I will take some time between the two of us to figure out what is truly going on. \n\nEDIT II - I want to clarify something. I\u2019ve been getting a lot of feedback, mostly negative, where everyone is irritated with me that I\u2019m upset with my wife for being with two men in the same night. None of my business, it was 20 years ago I should man up, that sort of thing.\n\nLook, i said it was hard to take. Most men understand their partner was with different people before them. But SEEING their spouse with two men on the same night is hard to handle. I didn\u2019t say I was changing my view of her, or leaving, or any other angst you want to put on me. It\u2019s just a difficult thing for a married man to see and realize. I\u2019ll get past it , but it\u2019s not an easy thing. And for everyone who says \u201cit was 20 years ago lighten up\u201d I challenge you to sit back, grab a beer and watch two young men have intercourse with your wife on the same night and see how you feel about it. Frustrated at best. You won\u2019t love her less but you\u2019ll not feel great afterwards trust me. So thanks for everyone calling me an asshole but until your in that position I\u2019ll ignore you thank you very much .\n\nFINAL EDIT - this will be my final edit. Thank you all for your support but all I will say is, it\u2019s time for me to make some decisions. I hacked into my wife\u2019s Facebook account - childish and immature I\u2019ll admit but I did it nonetheless. And I found things disturbing enough that I need to think long and hard about what I do next. I\u2019ve given her the benefit of the doubt through this entire thing , now a shadow had been cast and I\u2019m questioning her more than ever before. Heartbroken is putting it mildly. It\u2019s time for me to work on my life and my self. Thanks to everyone and their interest .",

But that is a little scary. I don\u2019t have any tapes or videos from me hooking up with people even from just 5 years ago. Someone saved this a very long time. And, unless y\u2019all have lived in the same house for decades, they\u2019ve also tracked where she lives (and clearly know she\u2019s married to you, probably a lot more) \n\nI don\u2019t want to scare you, but this could be something much more than just a tape sent over. People saying stuff about blackmail is a definite possibility. Although, it sure sounds like, if that\u2019s the case, she didn\u2019t give them what they wanted. \n\nGood luck! I hope it turns out to be nothing big!",

This is a tape of your wife having sex with someone other than you so without any warning your wife may be genuinely afraid that you\u2019re going to think the worst of her, even if it\u2019s not the case. No need to put her through that kind of emotional trauma.\n\nComing to her and telling her what you found and showing her that you trust her will mean the world to her and shows that you truly trust and care for her over any feeling of jealousy or anger.\n\nIf you address this as a couple and as partners, you can hopefully come out of this stronger because this is certainly a weird situation. Someone sent this maliciously and maybe your wife would know who is trying to do this. I hope the best for you in this situation.",

There are dozens of reasons why this could have happened now.\n\nThe ex b/f has found the video at the bottom of the drawer after all these years, and is still a bit pissed of at how she broke up with him.  Annoyed enough to find it amusing to send the video as some kind of late payback.\n\nHell, the ex b/f's soon-to-be-ex-wife could have just found it as she empties the house out and *she* sent it as some kind of revenge on the guy. Nothing to do with your wife other than using her to hurt the ex-husband.\n\nI doubt that this about making you think that she has cheated on you. This is about shock value and it's possibly about your finding out that your wife was involved in a gangbang that she's never told you about.  Plenty of guys would feel very uncomfortable find out about that even twenty years after the fact.",

She put the tape in the mail for him to find for some reason, which may be she wants to break up the marriage but hopes will do it when he sees the tape, or she thinks it\u2019s scandalous and a little bit naughty and using it as a means to spice up their marriage. u/remember_is_ninja\n\n7. The wife sent it to see how he feels about swinging without having to bring it up on her own.  She has plausible deniability but gets to feel him out on his view. u/Moby_Tick\n\n8. One of the dudes randomly found it and simply thought it'd be funny to mail it to \"whoever she's fucking these days\u201d.  u/Many_Faces_of_Mikey\n\n9.  She sent it to gauge his reaction. u/u-no-u\n\n10.  One of those gentleman received a transmittable disease and this is his revenge. u/mydogisamy\n\n11. She is secretly a mother to a child conceived in the video.  u/mydogisamy\n\n12. She mailed it to the husband herself as some kind of fetish thing.  u/mydogisamy\n\n13.  A emale friend found the tape and sent it. The motive there could be blackmail, jealousy, thing for the husband or some sort of self-righteous truth cleansing BS.  u/hunibe \n\n14.  One of the guys who kept it was dating/engaged to his current wife at the time it was made and she found it &amp; sent it to OP as some sort of way of getting back at the wife (not that I personally think the wife is responsible for a cheating guy\u2019s actions).  u/swarleyknope\n\n15.  Someone someone close to the wife (someone that has access to her belongings from when she was younger) found it and thought he deserved to know, thinking that it was during their relationship. u/Dre6485",

The wife is innocent until proven otherwise somehow and she is likely going to be mortified and shocked at first. She doesn't need to be tricked by her partner into watching it. In fact have a conversation with her and prepare her. She may even want to see it alone and I think she has the right to request that.\n\nEdited for spelling",

Why wait until now to accuse of cheating. The vibe feels blackmail-y, and the fact that they know where you live and are staying anonymous rather than reaching out through fb or even a signed letter or something like that doesn\u2019t help their case. \n\nI\u2019d A) tell your wife and B (but also really coincide with A in priority)) call the police. They need to have it on record that someone is anonymously harassing you with potentially malicious intent and via illegal means at your home address in the event something more serious happens. ",

Bug if it's digital and if you have the file and not a DVD that would play in a DVD player, there very well might be meta data on the file. Assuming you're using a windows computer look at it in file explorer and right click it and go to properties. Go through the tabs for any extra information about the file. There probably won't be too much about it. But you might find the date it was taken.\n\nI personally feel like what you need to decide is if she was fucking around while you were dating/engaged, how much does that matter after 20 years or marriage.

I think it\u2019s someone she jilted recently. Maybe one of those guys got back in touch with her or came back into her life, they got close and he wanted more and she said no. Or she was crossing a line with him and then decided to pull back after making him think they were something more. Maybe an affair just ended. Youre thinking it\u2019s from the past and why now? Well... maybe its because of something that is happening now. \n\nAlso how did all three sex tapes come together? You said it\u2019s three different guys. Is it all taped in the same room? Any recognizable signs... like maybe its the same guys voice behind the camera? Does it look like its the same camera used in all three videos (possible to tell if it was taped with a vhs camcorder)? Was it vhs? How could 3 videos of 3 seperate sexual encounters be put together on a dvd if it wasn\u2019t a guy she was dating taping the sex and keeping the videos or if it wasn\u2019t something SHE recorded and kept? I mean,  the one common denominator in all this is your wife. If you show your wife, she should have no problem immediately knowing who sent it. How else would 3 different videos be put together if they were in the possession of three different people? And if they were, how would that person know who to contact for sex tapes of her... and actually be given the sex tape? What city was it sent from? Do all of you (you, wife, guys in video) live in the same city still? \n\nMy thoughts on this is that your wife knows exactly who sent it and most likely knows why. After telling her and showing her the videos I\u2019d be asking her to hand over her phone because I think she\u2019s up to something in the present. ",

Over 20 years ago, we didn't have an eighth of the technology we do now. If she hasn't cheated, which I believe, this can be broken down into a complex series of steps.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFirst, these three sex videos were recorded with a camcorder to separate vhs tapes. Since dvds didn't come out until 2000 (even then, they were slow to start for the public), this is the only way it can be done before your marriage. Then they would have to be spliced together, either onto a vhs or dvd, years later. This would happen multiple times, depending on the quality of the videos, because they both degrade with time. Not to mention the person would have kept up with not only all this, but your personal address and information. It's not someone at the office that likes you or her. It's someone one or both of you have known for a long time. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTL;DR - If you feel your wife has been faithful, this is dangerously psychopathic behavior by someone that has known you guys for a long time. The dates and tech just don't match up for any other explanation besides this, or cheating.\n\nAfter further consideration, it's pretty strange that someone was able to collect 3 separate sexual encounters on tape. Are you SURE this isn't some kind of kink thing your wife might be into? Perhaps she is the one that put this together?",

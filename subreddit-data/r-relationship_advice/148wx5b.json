    "postText": "I was going through his gallery sitting beside him. I use his phone to take pictures often because they take better quality than my own. I came across a dozen nudes of a woman I didn\u2019t know and a video of her kissing another woman. \n\nI reached out to her, she was apologetic and confirmed the photos were sent before he and I were dating along with proof of dates sent. He didn\u2019t have an affair but I feel sick. \n\nHow did those photos show up in his gallery now that haven\u2019t been there the past 2 1/2 years I\u2019ve scrolled? \nHe is so apologetic, swears he doesn\u2019t know how the pictures got there and that he deleted them years ago. \nHow can deleted photos from June 2020 reappear on an Android phone? Would he have had to restore the photos himself? \n\nWe are trying to work through this, we both love each other. I just need to know facts. I\u2019m not great with technology. Advice is appreciated.",

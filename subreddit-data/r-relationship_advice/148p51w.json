    "postText": "Our relationship ended a couple of months ago (we were together for almost 10 years) and since the day my partner told me they wanted to break up I\u2019ve had zero contact with them.\n\nThey\u2019ve been posting hurtful things to try to get a reaction out of me on social media and it\u2019s really hurting my feelings and stirring up my anxiety. I don\u2019t look at their account but my friends share what they post with me.\n\nWhy are they doing this, and what do I do? How do I deal with these feelings? I have a therapist but I\u2019m not seeing them until the end of the week and I\u2019m not doing well emotionally right now.",

Stay strong and remember that with every little thing your ex does to harass or annoy you is just another reminder of the gigantic bullet you managed to dodge like Mario.",

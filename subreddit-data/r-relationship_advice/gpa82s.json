    "postText": "Yes, I know the title is bizarre and I can't believe I'm actually writing this. My wife is a neat freak. Always has been. She throws notes on my desk out assuming they're garbage, my belongings get rearranged to the point where it takes me hours to find them, it's something I've come to accept. I'm not happy about it, but we have a pretty happy marriage on the whole.\n\nI am a volunteer EMT, and I keep my boots unlaced up against the wall next to my clothes hamper so that I can throw them on along with my uniform if a call comes in during the middle of the night.  Well, my wife has taken to tying the boot laces when she sees them untied. Not only does she tie them, but she tightens them and double knots them to the point where I need to undo the knot, open up the boots, and let a little slack out to fit my feet into them.  I ignored it the first two times, but the third time she did it, I made it a point to bring up to her the next day.\n\nI very calmly said, \"Hun, I appreciate that you want everything neat, but please do not touch my boots in the future. Time is of the essence when I'm going on a call and at 2 in the morning I don't have the time to unlace them and open them up. It's not just a minor inconvenience, it's people's lives, so I would appreciate it if you left them alone.\"\n\nShe rolled her eyes, said I was being dramatic, and that she wouldn't help me out by keeping my things neat in the future.\n\nWell she never stopped. No matter how many times I've asked her, told her, begged her; she just laughs and says, \"Well you know how I am!\"\n\nThe other night a page went out for a CPR in progress.  I went to throw my boots on and they were, once again, tightened beyond recognition.  So I'm sitting there on the edge of the bed, cursing, trying to get my boots open, and fumbling due to the stress of the situation.\n\nMy wife opened her eyes, groggily looked at me, and asked, \"Don't you need to go on that call?\"\n\nI know I was in the wrong here, and I regret it. I slammed the boot into the ground and yelled, \"Yes! I do! I would have been out the door five minutes ago, except SOME STUPID MOTHERFUCKER FUCKED WITH MY GODDAMN BOOTS AGAIN!\"\n\nMy wife got up without another word, walked into the bathroom and slammed the door. I got my boots open and went on the call. By the time we arrived, the police had gotten her back, so I didn't have to do CPR, but I was sweating and shaking thinking my delay could have cost a life.\n\nI got home and my wife wasn't talking to me. She ignored me the entire day until we finally sat down and talked. She said I had scared her with how angry I got, that she thought I was going to hit her, and she didn't know I was capable of getting so angry. Note: I have never raised a hand to her, nor have I ever yelled at her before; I am absolutely not a violent person in any way shape or form.\n\nI apologized for yelling at her, and acknowledged that I hadn't meant to snap at her, I was frustrated with the situation as I needed to get to the person in need of CPR as soon as possible and it was a delay that didn't need to happen.  I, once again, pleaded with her not to touch my boots because lives were literally on the line.\n\nShe told me that if I was going to overreact and make her afraid then she would never touch my boots again because she didn't want to live like that.\n\nLast night, before I got into bed, I had a sinking feeling, so I went over and checked my boots.  I was very disappointed to find them tightened up again.  So I decided to show her how it felt. I went over to her closet and pulled out her running shoes.  I unlaced the shoelaces on both of them, removed them from the shoes completely, curled them each into a little coil, put them inside the shoes, and put them back.  I then went to sleep.\n\nAt 6:15 I was woken up by my wife screaming, \"How could you!? Why would you do this?\" holding up both laceless shoes with tears in her eyes.  My wife likes to go for an early morning run and I knew she would want to get out the door as soon as possible.\n\nI smiled and said, \"You know how I am! I just like things neat!\" She continued sobbing and walked out of the room.  So, by the time she was all laced up again, it was raining so she missed out on her run.  I actually feel pretty terrible about that because I really only wanted to delay her, not ruin her plans completely.\n\nAt this point, she's alternating between crying that I went out of my way to hurt her and ignoring my presence. I acknowledge that what I've done has been pretty childish and not at all constructive. I just don't know what to do.\n\nShe said, through tears, \"You admitted you were totally in the wrong for yelling at me, and then you turned around and took it out on me in a different way! What is wrong with you?\"\n\nThe problem is, to her, an apology means taking on 100% of the fault.  When I apologized for blowing up, she took that to mean she was 100% in the right and that my feelings were completely unjustified. So at this point, I haven't apologized for ruining her run, because she'll take that to mean that she wasn't wrong to touch my boots.\n\nI've tried to have these discussions but it's in one ear and out the other.  We have such a good relationship otherwise, but I feel like this issue has reached a tipping point and it's going to continue to result in arguments until we resolve it.\n\nHow do I make things right with my wife while still letting her know that I won't tolerate her disrespecting my property anymore?\n\nEdit: Wow! This blew up! I went through comments for six hours last night and I still have 1.8k to get through.  I promise you I am reading every one of your comments and appreciate the advice.  A couple things to address points that keep getting brought up.\n\n1. My wife has never been diagnosed as having OCD. As an EMT, I'm very careful about labeling someone as having a disorder as I don't have the proper qualifications to make that diagnosis. I do agree that it's time for her to see somebody, get a proper diagnosis, and address these issues.\n2. My boots lace up in the front and zipper on the side. They're not a full unzip but rather an unzip to open them up a bit. The way my wife is tying them makes them impossible to get on even with the zipper down. They're weather proof and great for standing on rough terrain or the highway after accidents. They're only about a year old and were actually a gift from my wife. I've not considered Velcro before, I'm a bit hesitant to do that as I don't know that they wouldn't catch on things or wear out quicker.  I've tucked the laces in but she still tied them up.\n3. This is a bit of compulsive behavior on my part. I don't leave my boots in the garage because my mother was a smoker growing up and that's where she would smoke. So I would end up with ashes in my shoes and having them reek of tobacco after. So I developed a habit of wearing them into my home. Also, if I leave them there, they're likely to get moved someplace 'safe' where it will take me even longer to find them.  Putting the boots in the closet, she found them and tied them.  Putting them under the bed or out of sight they were found, tied, and moved to the closet.\n4. I honestly believe that a footlocker or any other kind of box would get moved to where I would have to wake her up to find it. If it's locked, then my keys are likely to go missing. For some reason, sitting on my dresser is not appropriate but in the pocket of a jacket downstairs in the closet is.\n5. I am likely going to start putting my boots in the car. Though I had to laugh at the people suggesting decoy boots. As much as it may seem like it, I'm not living in a Spy vs. Spy cartoon.\n6. I am a volunteer EMT. We respond from home. We don't have sleeping quarters, and I work the overnight shift so I sleep during my shift, get out of bed when a call comes in, drive to the building, and take the ambulance to the scene. This is typical of volunteer organizations.  Paid EMS is more likely to have sleeping quarters or even require EMTs to be in the truck throughout their shift. Community based EMS is more likely to take 911 calls and respond to emergencies whether paid or volunteer.  Private EMS is more likely to take transport requests such as to/from dialysis or chemotherapy as well as hospital to nursing facility discharges.\n7. To those who have told me that I don't have the right to use the word lifesaving, on my dress uniform I have pins for 3 defibrillator saves and 4 for CPR saves. I've crawled into a car wreck to open someone's airway and bag them until we could get them out. While transporting a patient I recognized signs of internal injury and ordered we divert to a trauma center, where he was put directly into emergency surgery that saved his life.  Did I do these things entirely by myself? No, of course not. I would never claim that I was the sole reason someone lived. However, I am, at my very basest level, as vital link in the chain or survival. So while I can't claim complete credit for any of the things I've done, I would certainly put a lot of blame on myself if someone didn't live because of something I failed to do.\n8. I have a full-time job that I work 8-5 Monday - Friday outside of EMS.  That is why I volunteer on the night shift. My wife works as a payroll manager for a mid-sized office.  I earn about $10,000 a year more than her.  We've been married for two years. While I lived on my own before we were married, she didn't move into the apartment until we got engaged. So, I think to her, that was my place, not ours, and she didn't really touch my things.  I was with another EMS organization until we moved to a new town after our engagement.  When we bought the house, I joined the local volunteer squad as an EMT. My wife regards my job as part of my identity while she sees the EMS as something I volunteer to do. She would say, \"This is my husband, he is \\[job title\\],\" not \"This is my husband, he is an EMT.\"\n9. Thank you for all the awards on this post. You're all very kind. I appreciate so much that you took the time out of your day to acknowledge things and want to help me.\n\ntl;dr Wife keeps tightening my boots when I'm not wearing them, delaying me on ambulance calls. I finally had enough, and she's calling my response abuse.",

It is not funny if someone loses a life because of her obsession with neatness, but clearly she seems to shrug it off with a laugh. She may be playing the victim here, but it's actually you who is being victimised, and you're not in the wrong. She may be a really nice person overall, but her failure to respect how you want your things to be is simply unacceptable. I can understand compromises but just because you apologise because you feel bad for venting out on her, she's using that to play the victim and is preying on your guilt. The nicest people with the best of intentions can do horrible things thinking they are in the right. You need to lay down the law and make her realise she needs to compromise on her obsession to an extent too. It has to be a two way street.",

For example, if she says she will keep doing it, note to her that you will wake her up and ask her to untie the laces each time it happens.  \n\nFrankly, I would seek counseling as there are probably other control behaviors she exhibits which may be due to a personality disorder.",

She had a melt down after you \"ruined\" her run (really, you could not have predicted the weather) and yet she thinks you are overreacting when you're literally trying to save lives and she is hampering you?!  Does she completely disrespect you?  Actually - I ask this in all honesty - does she have any mental disorders?  Because I honestly don't understand how she can do this one thing over and over again despite you pleading with her not to do it. Not to mention, it's insane to tightly lace your shoes after you take them off, even for a neat freak.  Who wants to struggle to unlace shoes before putting them on and lace them up again?  Just put tuck the laces back into the shoes if you must be that neat. Sorry I ended up going into a rant. I hope you can resolve this issue - I sincerely hope you get some good advice because it seems like you've tried everything. Good luck.\n\nEdit: words",

            "comment": "I\u2019m actually stunned to finally hear someone describe OCD symptoms this similar to what I\u2019ve observed from my father. He\u2019s exhibited these exact same behaviors as long as I\u2019ve been alive - I mean, identical, right down to tying/zipping people\u2019s shoes and responding with anger and defensiveness when asked to stop. I\u2019m well into adulthood and he STILL goes in my room every time I visit and rearranges my stuff. It doesn\u2019t matter how neat I am; it\u2019s not about that. It\u2019s about control of his environment. If he\u2019s touched everything in the room, if he\u2019s arranged it as he thinks it should be arranged, his anxiety is quelled. \n\nFor the longest time, I thought he was just a dick who didn\u2019t respect my boundaries. And yes, the boundary issue is part of it, and mental illness is not an excuse to be shitty to people. But when you\u2019re suffering with this kind of compulsion, it overwhelms any sense of boundaries a healthy person would have. OP\u2019s wife may understand on some level that this is a violation; she just doesn\u2019t, or can\u2019t, care, because the need to compulse is far stronger. \n\nMy dad is 80 years old and all I can feel is sadness that he never got the help he needed and now it\u2019s too late. I regret assuming that he was in complete control of himself and was just being an asshole. Only recently, in the throes of the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s, did he finally admit to my mom that he has always struggled with this and felt like he couldn\u2019t stop himself. With a great deal of shame, he confessed that, when left unattended, he would even rearrange things on his boss\u2019s desk but would barely remember doing it afterward. \n\nOP, please try to get your wife to accept help. She will be very resistant - it is terrifying for someone with this disorder to contemplate losing that sense of control. That\u2019s why she\u2019s being such a dick about it. She will make excuses, she will blame you, she will not admit that she has a problem. Don\u2019t listen. Push as hard as you can. If she still won\u2019t seek help, it is perfectly acceptable to say that you won\u2019t stay in a relationship where you have to tolerate this. But if your wife means as much to you as you\u2019ve described, please don\u2019t listen to all these comments calling her a selfish asshole and at least try to help her free herself of this.\n\nEdit: wow, guys, I\u2019m truly touched that this blew up a bit. Thank you so much for the awards!! If my perspective has helped anyone at all, I\u2019m glad I shared it. Thanks also to the people who mentioned OCPD. I had actually never heard of it, but did some reading just now and damn, that\u2019s right on the money. Sounds very much like what OP and his wife are dealing with, too. Best of luck to anyone facing a compulsive behavioral issue. It has been so comforting to me to read all these comments from people in the same boat and I hope it has helped you, too.",

I\u2019m not even that big of a neat freak though I do like to keep a pretty clean house. \n\nBut the easiest way for me to notice that my anxiety is getting bad again is that I cannot tolerate messiness AT ALL, especially in the kitchen. I have to wash every single dish that gets used IMMEDIATELY after it is used. It feels completely out of my control. I just have to do it or I won\u2019t be able to stop thinking about it. I practically pull the cups out of my boyfriend\u2019s and my roommate\u2019s hands so I can go wash, dry, and put them away.\n\nI\u2019ll end up at the sink doing one or two dishes or utensils 20 times a day. It\u2019s annoying to everyone, including myself but I never let it go on for very long because as soon as it starts up I know I\u2019m spiraling and I do the things I know work to get myself out of it.\n\nEdit: To everyone diagnosing me with OCD even though I just said I don\u2019t have it: I see both a psychiatrist and therapist and neither of them think I have OCD. You guys are just reading the term, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and assigning a diagnosis based on that. If you did one google search you would know that just having occasional compulsions to clean while very anxious does not even come close to meeting the full criteria for OCD.",

When my anxiety gets bad I organize to no end (worse than normal)..like, take everything out of drawers and closets so that I can organize them in a more acceptable manner. And I organize while organizing. Those totes I just moved out of the closet to reorganize? I dump them out too and reorganize them as well.  \n\nI have OCD tendencies outside of anxiety too, but anxiety makes it out of control.  People try to comfort me by telling me it's great to be so organized and I'm a motivator for them to do the same. Yes, it's nice to be organized but im doing it to the extent im doing it too because I'm struggling badly with anxiety when I am in that mode.\n\nI think its the repetitions that drive me insane, yet it would drive me insane not doing them or whatever OCD behavior I end up engaging in. So, I'm damned either way. I've pretty much learned to accept it and as you mentioned, it's better acknowledging your spiraling then not.

OP could also be a \"caretaker\", where he does what is needed to keep the household going smoothly but he's now at a tipping point (or maybe breaking point)\n\nBeen there, done that.",

OP's anger shows just how important a delay her behavior causes.  But his wife is so self-centered she literally thinks OP tied her laces just to hurt her.  It's a bit infuriating to read how upset she is by being inconvenienced when she is repeatedly putting her impulses over people's lives. All those desperate people waiting for emergency help and here's OP's wife just doing what she wants despite OP's pleas.",

I felt anger towards your wife just reading your post. It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say her obsessive behaviour is literally endangering lives.\n\nAs a short term measure, could you reach a compromise with your wife? Perhaps suggest to have your laces tucked inside the boots (not tied, tightened but simply loosely tucked) until she has reached a point where she isn\u2019t so fixated on neatness.\n\nEDIT: Just adding OCPD and OCD are often confused but a main difference is people with OCD have ego dystonic obsessions (not consistent with their internal values and beliefs).",

Let's unpack a little:\n\n* She refuses to respect your boundaries. It doesn't matter how \"silly\" they seem. They are _your_ boundaries.\n* She's outright lied to you regarding not touching your boots again. \n* She is vastly hypocritical (seriously? She broke down crying and screaming that she couldn't go on her morning run, but YOU'RE the one overreacting when you getting delayed might cost a life?)\n* She's possibly highly maniuplative. She's twisted your apology into a \"he's totally wrong and I'm totally right\" by framing it as you \"overreacting\", and she was \"Afraid you were going to hit her\" for no reason. Give me a fucking break.\n* She, a grown woman, uses the silent treatment.\n* She minimizes and belittles what you do for a living (and I'm willing to bet she does it with your hobbies, too).\n\nI'm not going to say to divorce her, but I am going to ask that you lurk this sub a little bit. Scroll through some top posts, check up on it every now and then for a week or two. What you'll end up finding, not necessarily in every post but often enough, are the victims of toxic or outright abusive relationships regularly defending their partner because \"their relationship is wonderful otherwise\". \n\nThe thing is, *every* trap has some bait in it. Otherwise, no one would ever fall for it. \n\nAgain, I'm not saying to dump her, but I am asking you to open your eyes to the fact that **this is so much more than a pair of boots**. Your wife has serious issues; whether those are born out of mental illness like anxiety or OCD, or if it is more malicious, I'm not sure. But therapy, individual for both of you and couples therapy, needs to be your first stop.",

She may have seen something at some point that gave her the misconception that you're mostly just transporting people instead of actually being the one to resuscitate people who have died. My aunt \"died\" earlier this week but the EMTs were able to get her heart started again. Unfortunately she'd gone without oxygen for too long and is brain dead.

He was unconscious and wouldn't wake. I've never been more terrified in all my life. My sister picked up the phone and called the ambulance. After I can't remember how many (but too many) minutes, they should have reached us (they're only a few blocks away in a small town and it was early morning with no traffic), and I called them back, asking if they were actually sending an ambulance. They said someone was on their way. But they took so damn long. And for years, I felt that my father, this amazing man, a man whose memorial service was so crowded that the church needed two overflow rooms, a man who made every single person he spoke to feel seen and accepted and important (I've had people tell me this multiple times and witnessed it for myself), I felt that he just wasn't a priority for the EMTs who arrived at our home. They finally got him to the ER. There was nothing the doctor's could do. He had a blood clot. Every second counts with a blood clot. And they took so damn long. I don't know that EMTs would have ever been able to reach us in time, and I'll never know. It took me years to stop being angry about it.\n\nYour wife says you're \"being dramatic\" because she's ignorant. Please tell her that she's never been more wrong. EMTs meet people of the worst days of their lives. Every. Second. Counts.",

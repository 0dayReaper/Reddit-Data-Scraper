    "postText": "I (25f) have been with my (29f) gf for a year and a half and as great as it was, our arguments really got to me.\n\nOur last arguments (in my previous posts) were really draining and I even said I cant do this anymore, which is when she offered to change and go to therapy. The thing is she has told me she\u2019ll change 6 times before which I didnt even realise. But she sounded serious time this and I said okay I\u2019ll give it a shot, we started hanging out and it was all fine but I was still hurt deep down and I didnt feel like she acknowledged her actions apart from saying sorry. She had 1 therapy session and is going to change to another, and in my head I just thought \u201cthis is going to be a long process and she could react the same way until then.\u201d \n\nI tried and was acting normal and doing all the couple things but I had this weird anxiety feeling looming over me and then I thought I cant move past her actions and I\u2019ve cried enough after every argument. I love her a lot and I really wanted it to work but she\u2019s fought me when I was on holiday, christmas, new years, had her ex stalking us outside and I was the \u201cmean\u201d one for asking her to sort it out.\n\nI feel guilty because she said that I was acting normal and hanging out with her. She said so the last few weeks were a lie and this is out of the blue because we were talking normally. I feel bad but I\u2019ve tried to end it on the phone, in person, after an argument and it was the same reaction or worse. \n\nShould I send a final message to say sorry? I feel bad about it and now I can\u2019t stop thinking about how I approached it.",

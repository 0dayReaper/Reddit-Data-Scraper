    "postText": "So yesterday my girlfriend casually asked me how I prefer pubic hair to be groomed. She usually keeps hers short, but neat. I assumed she was just looking to change things up and wanted my opinion so I answered honestly and said that I find completely shaven attractive, but in the grand scheme of things I couldn't care less, it's not a turn off if there's hair, and that I like the way she has it now. \n\nWell it turns out she had had a lecture today at college (she studies psychology) and the topic was on peadophiles. Apparently one of the talking points was that pedophiles are attracted to the lack of body hair. \n\nWhen she told me this, I asked her \"are you seriously calling me a pedophile because I find completely shaven attractive?! Can I just point out that you're 21 and not 12?\" She basically skirted around my questions and then stormed out of my apartment when I kept pressing her on it. As she left she called me revolting and is now ignoring my calls and text messages. \n\nWhat. The. Fuck.\n\nHonestly not even sure where to go from here. We've never had any issues and was planning on proposing in the next year. Where has this even come from?! \n\n**TL;DR:** Girlfriend pretty much called me a pedo because I told her I liked shaved pussy when she asked me my preference.",

I used to shave/wax my private bits, because I thought that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do. Everytime I did, I got a terrible rash, itching and ingrown hairs (regardless of method used). It looked disgusting and felt much worse. Eventually, I decided to stop shaving/waxing and I just keep my bush trimmed short and clean. It made a huge difference for me and sex became much more enjoyable for me without the constant itching. At one point I asked my husband about his preference about pubic hair and he basically said the same thing you did - he finds shaven atractive, but what I do is entirely up to me and he\u2019s fine with whatever style I choose, as long as I\u2019m clean he doesn\u2019t really care. I explained the reason for me choosing a short trimmed bush and he was (and still is) perfectly fine with that. In return, he asked me about my preference and I told him the truth - I don\u2019t care at all. Clean is all that matters to me, so he\u2019s free to choose as well. At no point in that conversation did I think of there being something wrong with his preference. I\u2019ve seen enough porn over the years to know what the \u201cmainstream standard\u201d looks like. I think your GF is projecting a bit too much from her courses on you and your relationship. As someone else already pointed out, she\u2019s also completely disregarding the general pressure placed on adult women to shave absolutely every bit of hair below the eyebrows. What\u2019s gonna happen when they learn about psychopaths, sociopaths and so on? Is she gonna go out of her way to diagnose you with all that as well?\n\nShe needs to chill and stop taking random things out of context to fit some theory they currently preach in school.\n\nEdit: someone pointed out that it look like I was grouping psychopaths and schizophrenics as something inherently bad and it came across as offensive, which was not my intention, so I changed it for \u201csociopaths\u201d. I was just trying to pick two random examples of things they might cover in their courses, that\u2019s all.",

Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with it per se, but it is good to be aware of where such influences came from. They\u2019re not the \u201cnatural\u201d default way for humans to enjoy sex, but rather what makes for a more interesting looking porn video.\n\nSome cultures also do waxing for cleanliness purposes (iirc Muslims, not sure if others).  So its not porn alone... but if you\u2019re in a western country odds are very high you learned it from porn. \n\nAnd in many (most?) other cultures there is no such set image of shaving being the attractive thing, so the default is not shaving.   \n\nThe hair does serve some evolutionary purposes like protecting the genital region from bacteria, insects, dust etc but since we tend to wear underwear and pants these days it\u2019s not as urgent to keep it.",

She anticipated your response given that it's fairly common knowledge that we have normalized and sexualized adult women being completely hairless, agree with it or not. There was a high likelihood of you responding with some degree of favor towards this.\n\nBaiting behavior like this can be a function of feeling a loss of control in an interpersonal dynamic. When you can create conflict and engineer it in a way to gain moral superiority, you have gained the illusion of control over something. Or, this could be a red herring conflict in which something like this is used in place of discussing other conflicts as they may be too difficult to address head on. An extension of that being this could be a way for her to break up with you over something different that she has determined she won't share with you directly.\n\nEither way, conflict in and of itself is not bad. In fact, it's essential for healthy relationships. But when someone manipulates another into conflict, especially over hypotheticals (this is a form of gaslighting) or in instances where there was no constructive purpose for it to happen, this is unhealthy.\n\nEdit: typo\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for the gold!!!",

I suppose I got lucky though, since my class was filled with a bunch of goofballs who just liked to poke fun at Freud. I never really thought about those who would use it to suspect everyone around them though. From the sound of it, OP's partner probably either suspected them of pedophila, or suspects everyone of it. What I'm saying is, bluntly put, she seems like she will point her finger at anyone she suspects of wrongdoing and accuse them without any real evidence.",

It's okay if a woman herself prefers that way, but it's horrible that anyone who doesn't feel okay shaven due to skin irritation, ingrown hair, etc. are sometime forced and blackmailed by their partners. If I don't want to shave down there, I also don't want to be criticized because of my own choice and forced to do something I don't feel comfortable with.

No one just drops an eighteen month relationship over that, there was definitely more than that going on and either OP was clueless that his girlfriend was already unhappy with him or he didn't disclose whatever else was happening before this blow up.\n\nAlso, it sounds like the girlfriend dumped OP so whether he was going to propose or not, she clearly didn't want him anymore. She's 21. She'll grow up some and hopefully be a better communicator in the future. \n\nThis is why, in my opinion, people shouldn't think about marrying their partners until they hit at least their mid twenties together.

She also may be a little immature.\n\nIn media, we are bombarded with the message that men prefer no pubic hair. Some women would prefer to have it and there is plenty of insecurity and second guessing at that age. She doesnt want to be clean shaven, now knows that is your preference and so is trying to make your preference seem ridiculous.\n\nIt's not right, its immature born from insecurity. A lot of people are saying to break up with her but I think that's totally rash. I would suggest having a conversation with her where you say you felt hurt and confused by her comment, many men and women prefer clean shaven pubic area and it is no indication of pedophilia. And let her know that you're attracted to her regardless. Hopefully then she will apologise and move on.",

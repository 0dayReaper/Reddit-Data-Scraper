    "postText": "24M here. I have been in a relationship with my best friend for the past 2.5 years.  I recently came across a post here about love bombing. And looked about it on the internet and I realised that I'm a love bomber myself. I keep giving constant attention to my girlfriend. And I feel sad whenever she doesn't want to spend time with me when she can. I gift her a lot. I constantly need reassurance that she loves me. How to stop being this way? Please help me. This kind of leads to us fighting now and then. I want to correct myself for the better.",

It's written by a woman who claims to have changed her attachment style to secure, and I feel she has a lot of valuable things to say and that the video was well made.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDGj1nAt_N8\n\nVideo runs about 20 minutes.",

            "comment": "Well love bombing is really more talking about those who just met going haywire with the love and gifts and I\u2019m talking on scales of weeks to months. 2.5 years is a long enough time to say I love you and mean it. Love bombers dont typically last that long, they break up much quicker than you already have. The only time I would call it love bombing in a long-term relationship as if it\u2019s being used as a technique to cause the significant other to justify your own toxic habits (like abuse). Not that the anxious attachment style isnt something to work on - it is.",

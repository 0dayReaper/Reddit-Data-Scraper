(35 yr)\r  \n\r  \nit was an innocent conversation and we had a lot to talk and share... feelings developed and we felt for each other.. a perfect love... everything was excellent.... laughters/touches/ jokes.. we do silly things together and we laughed at each other... its perfect... i used to be ashamed of watching porn... but she was the one that told me its absolutely fine... i felt comfortable with her.. but she has her family... 3 children... oldest is 15 this year.. youngest is 4....\r  \n\r  \ni imagine a life with her... together and i wanted it... i really do want it.. i never thought i say i would leave my kids for her... but i would... she had initally wanted a life together.. but couple of months later in the r/s... she said she wanted to stay for her kids, not have a broken family... i respect that... and i never blame her for that... obviously i am upset but i come to terms on that.. she said wait for her to be ready.\r  \n\r  \nmy wife wanted a divorce after finding out the affair.. i ask b if she was ready... she said no... she told me.. try to work it out with her... hang onto it.. when she is ready... its not too late... so i tried... it was traumatic.. tiring.. going thru discussion and talks with wife on divorce which is a drain... until i thought there is no point to talk.. and i will leave my family and wait in hope she is ready soon for me... i told b my plans...\r  \n\r  \n( it would have been me living alone... after the divorce with no guarantee b will eventually decide i am the man for her... ) tbh, its a scary thought... quarrels pick up between me and b... on this leaving the family... it got a drain on us... back and forth... b started to say.. she doesnt trust me... she wanted to give her hubs a chance... i really start to question... does she want to be with me for me?.. she said my action doesn seem to want to leave my fmily... 3x she said she wanted to leave.. in a span of 1mth... and i have to convince her its her that i want... that i do want a future with her....\r  \n\r  \nfast forward a month, my wife decided to try out and see if we do work out... for me... i have no feelings for the mrs... i only have feelings for b.. but i cant bear to leave the kids to be single parent... so if the reason i stay will be for the kids.... so when b asked what i wanted.. i said i wanted to stay for the boys and wait for b to be ready... but that didnt go down with b.. she blocked me out.... from all forms of social media... i ceased to be part of her life...\r  \n\r  \nWas i wrong? did i disappoint her? was it wrong to want to have more time with the boys while i wait for b to ready herself for me? or was it wrong to want to hear a guarantee for her.. she will eventually be mine.... so i know i have a happiness to look forward to... if she had given me the promise.. i would have leave my family in a heartbeat..\r  \n\r  \nshe said.. that is where i lose to her husband... unconditional love... her husband know about us.. but he wanted to know when it will end cause she said.. she will stay for the family... her husband have a guarantee... what do i have? nothing to hold onto... i thought a r/s is about compromise, understanding each other... have i wronged?\r  \n\r  \nwhat should i do... i understand she cant leave for her family... is unconditional love to love and even if i were to be alone for the rest of my life.. its whats called love... seeing her smile and laugh with her family... while i stand in a corner waiting for her... will i eventually see my happiness... that i dream of with her..",

            "comment": "You're 36, not a teenager. You got kids who look up to you. They need a dad who's present, responsible, and committed. Now you're considering trading all that for a 'perfect love'. Perfect love? Man, I call BS on that. There's no such thing as perfect love. All relationships, old or new, take effort and compromise.\n\n  \nYou're talking about leaving your kids like they're some sort of inconvenience. Those kids are your flesh and blood, pal. They need you. Imagine the kind of damage you'd do to them by abandoning ship. Not to mention the fact that 'B' isn't even giving you a guarantee. You're ready to gamble your family's happiness on a whim.\n\n  \nYou're not giving your wife a fair shot either. She took you back after you cheated, and now you're saying you feel no love for her. Have you tried to reconnect? Have you put in the work? Love isn't a magic potion you drink and boom, everything is perfect. It's a verb, it requires action.\n\n  \nYou want my advice? Stop thinking with your pants and start using your head. Take responsibility for your actions and their consequences. Your actions have caused a lot of pain, so now it's time for you to do what's right. Focus on repairing the relationship with your wife. See a therapist, do whatever it takes. Remember, your kids are watching. What do you want them to learn from you?\n\n  \nIf things don\u2019t work out with your wife after you\u2019ve put in the effort, then you move on, not before. If 'B' is truly meant for you, she will be there once you're free and clear. But understand this, if she's willing to get involved with a married man, what makes you think she won't do the same to you? It's time to wake up and face reality, my friend. Time to grow up.",

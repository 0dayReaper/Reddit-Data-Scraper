    "postText": "UPDATE:\nThanks for the advice.  I texted him to ask if he could try to put his work into a block if possible so it doesn\u2019t eat into the entire day.  And if he could give me as much notice as possible if he does need to work while on vacation so I can make plans to do something on my own instead of just sitting around waiting for him to be done.  And I\u2019m going to try to be understanding if a true emergency pops up that is not foreseeable or avoidable.\n\nORIGINAL POST:\nThe nature of my work is that I only work a couple hours a day and I need to schedule time off at the beginning of the month but then once I\u2019ve reserved the time I\u2019m 100% off work and able to focus on my personal time.   His job has demands where he might need to address urgent issues while on vacation like taking phone call meetings and answering work texts and emails.  \n\nI don\u2019t have paid vacation so it puts a pretty big financial burden on me to take any time off.  And so I think I will be annoyed if I\u2019ve taken the time off for my work thus taking on the financial  burden and then he\u2019s not really taking time off and instead potentially working remotely as opposed to actually taking vacation.  He\u2019s saying that he won\u2019t necessarily need to work on vacation but things can happen and his hands are tied when they do.    \n\nI told him that if he isn\u2019t able to reserve the time for the vacation I\u2019d prefer to not take time off for my work and we just do a staycations instead because I can just  work my couple hours and then take the remainder of the day off together.  Which in my mind is similar to his situation where he\u2019s saying he only needs to work an hour or two as urgent matters arise.  He\u2019s saying that a staycation is too limiting because he wants to travel together since it\u2019s fun and he can do his work from any location and doesn\u2019t see it as intrusive.   \n\nI\u2019m setting up this traveling boundary in an effort to avoid a situation where I start developing feelings of resentment towards him.  Am I being petty for establishing this boundary? Is there a better compromise I\u2019m not seeing?",

You\u2019re asking him to sacrifice his PTO for a staycation instead of a trip when it sounds like he probably is looking forward to that break from work. If the trip is too much of a financial burden on general to go then that\u2019s understandable but it sounds like you\u2019re just upset that his work cuts into his personal time. \n\nAnd honestly at that point maybe rethink what you\u2019re getting into. He\u2019s clearly very committed to his job. If you guys end up living together how are you going to feel about the weeknight emergency calls, the weekend meetings, etc.",

You can't spend 24/7 together whether you're at home or away ('cause that's a great way to destroy a relationship). Most people with important jobs simply don't have the luxury of being completely out of touch with work, ever. So ask him what he wants to do. If he'd rather do his few hours of work at a holiday destination than at home then you should plan a trip. You can use his work hours there to do your solo activities.",

You're basically telling him that you'll never travel with him because both of you know that the nature of his work might call for him to put in a couple hours.\n\nInstead of such a stark demand, see if you can find a different compromise.  Try to get him to promise to put in time only up until maybe 10am.  I fail to see anything quite so urgent that he can't schedule his stuff to morning hours.  Then he may need to shoot off a text or something, but that's life.  If he's putting some time in when you'd be getting up and cleaned up, that shouldn't be so bad.  But insist on no meetings and no phone calls after that.",

Not everyone has the ability to work remotely, or to choose a few hours here and there to complete their work. Give the man a break, and appreciate the times when he doesn't have to work, at least he is giving you a heads up that work emergencies are a thing, and he might have to buzz off for a minute to take care of things.",

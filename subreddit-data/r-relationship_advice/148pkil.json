    "postText": "Yesterday my gf (18f) of seven months called me (18m) and told she was at her female friends house, we chatted for a bit then at the end of the call she said she was gonna hang up and go shower with her friend, I immediately said I wasn't ok with that she for the next 20 mins she tried to justify it, saying that it isn't sexual and their just saving water. I told her if she did id consider it cheating and we'd break up.After about 10 mins she finally said she wasn't going to shower with her, it felt like she was lying to me and just wanted me off her back, I asked her to promise she wouldn't shower with her and she did promise. We hung up and today she's not answering my texts and I feel like she's mad at me, and that they did shower together. Should I have let her? I'm seeing her tmr to talk more about it.",

You can keep taking it up in seriousness and people will balk at various times, whenever they reach there own comfort level but the analogy persists.  \n\nUsually when people control what other people do with their bodies, it will eventually end poorly.

A shower in somebody's home isn't really a normal place to take a shower with your friend, at least in my opinion. But that doesn't mean the GF was doing anything wrong.

She might not see a difference between the two. Some folks are just less weird about nudity around others, and there's nothing wrong with either way of being so long as everyone is aware and can make the best decisions for themselves. \n\nHonestly, so long as she mentioned jumping into the shower with her friend the same way she would mention jumping in the shower on her own,  I can see why she might be upset. For someone who isn't body conscious, it could seem a great deal like you're trying to make your own insecurity and distrust her problem, and use it to control her behavior. I understand that in the US stuff like that is seen weirdly, but communal bathing isn't so uncommon everywhere.\n\nAll of that said, you're under no obligation to stay in any relationship that isn't working for you, but maybe work a bit on that issue you have trusting her cause if this is the only thing she's done that's made you question, you might have some trust issues that would be worth working through so that YOU can have your best life with ot without her.",

It's been a while,  but I've been in those locker rooms,  and I've ended up just as close or closer to naked and half naked folks in those locker rooms as I would have in a bathroom. It sounds like what you don't like is just a part of who she is, and she's willing to change that for you, which is great... for you. So, for her sake as well as yours, maybe ask yourself why you think it's okay for you to control a behavior you've admitted to knowing is entirely innocent, just because you don't like it. \n\nHaving boundaries is about YOUR behavior, not hers. 'I won't be in a relationship with someone who doesn't think anything of being naked around others in private' is a boundary. 'I will not be in a relationship with someone who intentionally does things I've expressed hurt me' is a boundary. 'I don't like this thing, don't do it' is an attempt to control someone. The difference is where the onus of action is. With a boundary, the onus of upholding that boundary is on you, with controlling others, the onus of action is an expectation on them to behave how YOU want them to.",

Not all the time but if we were both gunna shower might as well save water. \nBut this is where I feel the issue comes in if my bf told me he wasn\u2019t comfortable with that then I wouldn\u2019t do it anymore I wouldn\u2019t argue I would say is that how you really see if and if he said yes then I would say ok I don\u2019t agree with that but I respect you and our relationship so I won\u2019t do it anymore but I would like to later ok have a more in depth conversation about why you feel this way. But also for me I\u2019m straight although I have while drunk made out with a few women. I see lips as lips so it don\u2019t matter but when it comes to sex personally I don\u2019t want to sleep with women so for me showering together isn\u2019t sexual or weird or anything like that. But if she is bi or is pan or something then that would be very different and I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable either. Like if I had a bf and he was showering with his guy friends and he\u2019s straight then to me not a big deal but if he\u2019s bi and showering with them then I have a bit of an issue. \n\nI guess it just depends on her sexuality and what people consider cheating on relationship to what isn\u2019t. A lot of people have different opinions on it so as a couple you two should maybe sit down and define that together so you are on the same page. For an example a lot of people consider porn to be cheating and others don\u2019t. Just like some people might say a kiss on the cheek to a woman from a man is considered cheating while other just see it as a form of goodbye. \nPeople have different opinions and ideas on what relationships should look like and what they expect from their partner. You two should talk about what each of you expects and thinks a relationship should be like and if you don\u2019t agree you can either compromise or you could break up because you e realized your not compatible.",

If that\u2019s his boundary, then he has a right to be upset or want to end the relationship. \nBut that doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t have a right to be upset as well! Men literally take out their penises publicly in front of other men that they don\u2019t even know at urinals all the time. I have personally always found that to be weird. If I was a man and someone told me they weren\u2019t comfortable with me using the public bathroom, I\u2019d be annoyed and feel that the person was controlling and jealous about things that are stupid. \n\nAs a woman, I know you\u2019re right. It\u2019s not about saving water. Or maybe it could be if the hot water only lasts for a bit at the house the shower is taking place. But it\u2019s actually about companionship. Showering is lonely, and it interrupts conversation. I\u2019ve showered with other women but even more often I\u2019ve had a friend sit on the toilet cover and talk to me while I\u2019m showering. I\u2019ve FaceTimed my best friend and have gotten naked and taken a shower with her still on FaceTime. If someone found these things I did to be unacceptable, I would immediately end the relationship with them. \nThat\u2019s too much of an issue with jealousy for me that I\u2019m not even alone in there with a man and somehow you\u2019re still jealous.",

If you guys have a good relationship, and she's not toxic, then either she legit doesn't see any anything wrong in taking a shower with her friend, and/ or she is playing with you a little to see how you'll react. \n\nEither way, I don't think that there's any real threat there since she told you about it. Her telling you isn't sufficient evidence alone, but I get the sense that there's no threat.\n\nHere's a suggestion. What I might do is treat it as if she's toying with you. Joke around with her about being jealous because you what her for yourself, tell her things you would like to do with her the next time you guys shower together, etc etc. You could also say something like it's a bad idea because her friend will just get jealous and insecure when her friend sees how smoking hot your girlfriend is. It depends on your style and your relationship, but I would joke around in sexually flirt with her about it. She's giving you the perfect setup.",

It\u2019s okay to express them.\n\nAt the same time - when I was 18 I was comfortable showering with my friends, cuddling them platonically, changing in front of them etc. However, now that I\u2019m in my 30s the thought of it just creeps me out. I think when you\u2019re younger you are still learning how others operate, while learning your own boundaries as well. It\u2019s bittersweet because I miss being that free &amp; trusting. But time has taught me many lessons\u2026 &amp; now my privacy is important to me, my body isn\u2019t for everyone to see &amp; touch anymore (sexual or not) &amp; I\u2019m cautious how I proceed with my intentions.\n\nIf your post had said a full grown adult did this, I\u2019d have my reservations. But if she\u2019s 18\u2026. This is more normal &amp; more common than you think. \n\nRight now she is free from the reality of adulthood, she is trusting, loving &amp; careless in the good ways. If you can find a way to, let her enjoy it while she can\u2026 because as she gets older she will likely grow out of this. That won\u2019t be a bad thing either, but she\u2019s still coming into herself - &amp; has a long way to go. The more real life experiences she has, the less likely she\u2019ll be comfortable with this 2 years, 5 years or 10 years from now. Give her room to learn her own boundaries &amp; grow.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that she told you, so if she was hiding anything or actually doing something you\u2019d disapprove of\u2026 I doubt she\u2019d be that forward.

            "comment": "Wtf, that's a big no. I would nope out of there asap. It's not okay, especially since you told her it's not okay (but who in their right mind thinks it's alright to do that when being in a relationship, wtf). The fact that she has so much trouble respecting your boundaries (that are pretty fucking normal for most people) is a red flag, too. She's fine with saving water (I wonder if it's like that with any other situation lmao, bc I very much doubt so) but she's also fine with you being uncomfortable and hurt. I think any caring and loving partner would be like alright, that makes you uncomfortable, I'll stop it right away. But you need to have a whole ass conversation with her bc showering with her friend is more important?\n\nIt's not a good girlfriend. Don't answer her texts and let her shower with whoever she wants to save water. I wonder what other pretty normal for most relationships boundaries she's already disrespected but you just don't know about it.\n\nOh honey, don't be naive...",

No it\u2019s not appropriate for two adult women to shower unless they\u2019re at the beach in their swimsuits and it\u2019s outdoors and everybody is doing it.\n\nI would tell her if she\u2019s OK that if you shower with a girl then sure yeah. Tell her if it\u2019s OK for you to shower with another woman then you\u2019re fine with it. Don\u2019t tell her that I would just tell her no it\u2019s inappropriate she\u2019s still really young, but you need to set boundaries.",

            "comment": "I think it\u2019s totally normal for girls to see each other naked or shower together in a non sexual way. You assuming it\u2019s inherently \u201ccheating\u201d to be naked with another woman sounds insanely insecure to me. However, one thing that makes it weird is her excuse\u2026 to save water? Do you guys live in a third world country or something? Because if not, then I would assume she is lying for one reason or another",

            "comment": "I\u2019m super prudish about nudity. I will avoid being nude around other people and I am not comfortable with people being nude around me for no reason. I don\u2019t even like just existing in the nude while completely alone. Idk why, I just don\u2019t like it. \n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the same for men but for women nudity around each other is really normalized, even kind of forced. In middle school and high school I was expected to change in front of all the other girls and we weren\u2019t allowed to use the stalls for changing, we were all forced to just change out in the open around one another. I\u2019ve also switched schools a lot growing up and it was the same at every school. My friends also will regularly just strip down in front of me without checking with me first on whether or not I\u2019m comfortable with it. As a child I was regularly bathed with other girls, blood related or not. My mom would come into the bathroom while I was showering as long as I lived with her or encourage me to come into the bathroom while showering if I needed to grab something or use the toilet. I don\u2019t love it but I\u2019m used to it, it\u2019s just been expected of me my whole life to be completely fine with same sex nudity. Many of my friends have even offered to shower with me as an adult. It\u2019s just not weird to be nude around other women, no matter how tight the space is or how exposing the nudity is. I imagine for your girlfriend it\u2019s literally never even occurred to her that being nude around other women could be something anyone would be uncomfortable with and even with *my* prudishness around nudity I think it\u2019s a little much to ask her not to do that because it\u2019s just so\u2026 normal? I\u2019d have to go pretty far out of my way and intentionally make shit awkward to avoid nudity with other women. Despite my reservations it\u2019s 100% easier to just roll with it and get through it in the moment and not make it weird. And for context I\u2019m also American. Nudity is definitely a bit more touchy of a subject in America but it\u2019s not *that much more* of a touchy subject that we wig out about same sex nudity.\n\nIt\u2019s totally fine if you\u2019re not comfortable with that, but you and her need to have a talk about exactly what constitutes as \u201cunacceptable\u201d for you when it comes to same sex nudity and you need to be prepared for the possibility that she may be unwilling to compromise with you on this because for her it\u2019s such a non-issue that it might be straight up ridiculous to even try to respect your feelings around nudity. It depends on how often she regularly finds herself nude around other women (and as a woman I can say some level nudity happens a *lot* on a very regular basis). If she\u2019s unwilling to compromise you two might just be incompatible but I\u2019d say you\u2019d be very wise to lay out your boundaries around nudity with the next girl because across most cultures and countries nudity among women is extremely normal and common and you\u2019re going to have to specifically seek out a woman who is willing to compromise on nudity and let her know asap that nudity is an issue for you.",

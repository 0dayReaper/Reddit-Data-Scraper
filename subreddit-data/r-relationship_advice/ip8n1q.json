I'm particularly thankful for those who've lived through a similar situation(or have family and friends who've done so) and sent me advice on how this affected them and how to navigate the situation. I'd also like to thank the hundreds of mouthbreathing bigots who spammed my inbox.\n\nThe big takeaway for me was that if I'd need to lead by example here, not excluding her in any way because of her paternity so that she and my sons would see her as a full member of the family. Also that I need to be more active in confronting the bigoted and ignorant nonsense I've been hearing, and teach my sons to do the same to protect their sister. I've spoken to some of those responsible since and made clear my feelings on this, and that she is to be treated as a member family, and that if I ever find out that they've said things like that to my sons or their sister that they won't be allowed around us anymore.\n\nI've spoken to my wife about this, and we're more or less on the same page. She's been begging me to forgive her and not go through the divorce, but that's not going to happen. Even if I didn't consider the cheating unforgivable, I just dont feel any love for her any more, other then a platonic affection for her as the mother of my children. \n\nMy sons are handling this as well as can be expected. The 4 year old doesn't fully understand, but is upset by the change in the household, thankfully he's easily distracted. The 2 year old is thankfully too young to comprehend what's going on, but has definitely picked up on how withdrawn his mother has become. They're both fascinated with their new little sister, so there's that silver lining.\n\nMy wife OTOH isn't in good shape at all. She was depressed even before the birth, and now with everything- our divorce, her infidelity being revealed and the backlash from family and friends, PPD, and the exhaustion from raising an infant- she's barely functional. She's seeing a therapist, and I've been pressuring some of our family and friends to be supportive of her because even if they think she deserves it her current state is making it harder for me and our children.\n\nIt's become very obvious to me that even after the divorce is finalized we're going to have to live together for a while longer. She's in no shape to be taking care of three kids without someone else around to support her, and I'm not willing to deprive her of her sons by seeking sole custody. It's also too difficult financially, since she's lost her job because of COVID. \n\nAs for the baby girl, she's healthy and fairly easy by baby standards. Since I've been helping care for her, I've bonded with her and I've discussed the possibility of adopting her with my wife. She can't contact the father, as the only thing she knows about him is his first name. And given our coparenting situation it feels like adopting her as my daughter would be the best outcome for all involved-\n\nHOWEVER, there's been a wrench thrown in that plan. It was brought to my attention that there may be a way of finding the baby's father, namely by having her DNA tested by AncestryDNA. If the father or one of his relatives has also taken the test, we may be able to find him through there DNA match database.\n\nIf I'm being completely honest I'm not happy about this. I've already started to think of the baby girl as my daughter, and having him in our lives would massively complicate the family dynamic. Plus we live in Seattle and she met him in Philadelphia, so god knows how they'd even make it work if he wanted to be the kid's father.\n\nHowever, I recognize that this is a selfish reaction. If we have a chance of finding her biological father we owe it to her do so, if only so that she has access to her paternal medical history and so that she can have a relationship with him if and when she chooses to do so. I've read a few accounts by children raised by non-biological parents and a common thread is their desire to meet their lost biological parent, so thats that. We've ordered an AncestryDNA kit for her, and I guess we'll decide our next steps once we get the results back in a couple of months.",

If you need a dinner you simply pick one up before leaving school or during the summer you stop by and they give you 3 meals to go.\n\n\nIt's not a resource I need for my kids. But when I was i kid I needed it. The fact that kids in my community don't have to skip meals is amazing. Feeding kids has always been my charity of choice. So I guess it just hit me right in the feels.\n\n\nThe county also has its own suicide prevention/mental crisis hotline that works closely with all the mental health clinics. That go leaps and bounds to get rapid appointments for those in crisis. Which also got me teared up when I found out about it. I wish these were nation/world wide things already",

That's only if you don't want her to still live with you until she can, though. I can see how that would be a very hard situation for you to be in. I'm sorry this happened to you, OP. You're handling it incredibly well",

It might not look like you're getting what you deserve, but eventually it'll come around. Not everyone, but people you deserve will. For sure. \n\nI really appreciate your follow up, I regained some humanity in myself. I genuinely thought I want to be someone like you for my family when anything goes wrong. \n\nAnd please take care of yourself, be in therapy if you feel like it. You're obviously almost the only one who's pulling it together here and that seems way way too much for one person. \n\nAnyways, all the very best for you and your family. You're the best.",

Adopted children have a very hard time when they are raised by parents of a different ethnicity.\n\nBiracial children have it hard as it is and I think it would be beneficial if she could have some contact with her biological father or his family.\n\nI hope also you have some sort of long term plan. What your wife is going through is hard, but she ruined her own life and it\u2019s going to be a long time most likely before she gets to a good place. But she made her bed and that\u2019s not on you or the kids.\n\nLastly, I wish you luck. I hope everything works out for you and your family in the long run.",

There are a lot of people lauding the OP for stepping in as a parent (adopting the kid, making sure that the other kids refer to her as their sister and not half sister, etc), and there IS stuff to be lauded for in there... but it\u2019s easy to imagine the other side of the coin - this is a coping mechanism to deal with the loss of his (expected) child. By doing these things he can resolve the dissonance - expecting a daughter and ready for one, then don\u2019t have one, almost like you lost the child in the delivery room. This is a way of reducing that heartbreak.\n\nParaphrasing sentiments:\n\u2018She\u2019s their sister, not half sister!\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll adopt the child and it\u2019ll be like I\u2019m her dad like it was supposed to be\u2019\n\u2018The \u2018biological father\u2019 might need to be contacted for medical reasons, but I\u2019m her father\u2019\n\u2018Repeatedly refers to the child as his daughter\u2019\n\nSeems like sure she wants him to bond with and take parental ownership of this child, so is pushing for it - the incentives are obvious - but he has a psychological incentive to do the same, because the alternative is so damaging.",

She was briefly married to him and did end up adopting his son. She was very young, like 21. I met her when our kids were at preschool together a couple years later. I was curious about her story before I knew her because it seemed like she couldn't be the biological mom, but she was so young to have adopted. Almost 20 years later, her son's biological parents have both had nothing to do with him and she's raised him herself and never regretted taking on that responsibility when she had no obligation to.\n\nIf I'd read her story here I'd think it was likely bullshit, and I think this guy's story might be.

Imagine literally crayying someone elses kid for 9 months and not even telling the guy it may not be his. That\u2019s some cartoon villian deception.",

The father probably doesn't give a sh\\*t about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's say you adopt the child, well there you go. You've give permission to your ex wife or whatever you wanna call 'that' to f\\*ck you over even more in the future. You're spending time and money, and your affection on a child that isn't yours. It's your wife's and her absent sexual partner. Nothing to do with you at all. You do not owe it anything.\n\nInstead leave your wife. Leave the baby that's not yours. Use your time, money and affection on your kids that ARE yours. You do not owe anything to this baby.\n\nShe is NOT your wife anymore. She threw that down the drain when she had a baby by another man. She fuc\\*ed you, not in a physical way but mentally. Now she is going to drain you emotionally.\n\nGet out, save yourself and your two boys. Look after them. Give them all the love, affection, time &amp; money you can. Do not waste it on a baby that is not years, nor a wife that is screwing you over.\n\nYou need to find the courage OP. Find it. Show her that you can't be bent over and plowed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm disappointed OP, really disappointed in you. May God have mercy on your soul.",

    "postText": "I need some perspective and words of advice.\n\nWhen i started the relationship with her two years ago, i made a huge mistake in that i expressed that i always liked and used to have a crush on one of my close friends, who is the gf of one of my best friends. This threads and is a constant in our relationship, and i deeply regret this.\n\nI love my fiancee to bits. She is stunning, amazing and beautiful. When i met her, i dropped the idea of being with the other woman totally, and even though some feelings lingered I have never once expressed or acted in a way that doesn't confirm to her that she is the one for me, but the situation we're in is damaging us.\n\nI do not know how much our subsequent issues stem from this but she would months down he line from this start freaking out when i scrolled past women in bikinis on instagram, saying that it's typical for men and that this is such a structure that men are just able to look at girls like that and she would onward start fights and get obsessed with the fact that i was checking out other women on the street and in stores.\n\nSometimes she freaks out without me even registering other people, just walking by a girl she has told me that we \"stared at eachother\", oftentimes with people i never even looked in the eye.\n\nAt an airport one time she got really angry that i looked at a group of girls when i was actually just gazing off at 4am after traveling. I noticed these girls looking at me, but i honestly couldn't care less and it drives me crazy, i was just looking forward waiting for our bags to arrive.\n\nIt hurts that i feel so conscious of this insecurity in her and i work with her side of things but nothing i do is enough. It's better now, but i used to dread going into stores with her and felt really anxious about it. Feeling watched is one of my fears, and i hate the feeling. Feeling like a conflict was coming up whenever or wherever and being ready for something bad to happen.\n\nShe is the sweetest person, but these bursts of anxieties and anger really has made me feel burned out. She is constantly ready to be left, disappointed and abandoned. If i am feeling bad she has to figure out if it's related to her which removes a lot of the value of actually telling her what i feel because her response is always to ask leading questions to look for my willingness to leave her.\n\nShe told me yesterday that she is adjusting to me not making her my focus like the first year, but this irks me to no end. The amount of focus and work and love i feel doesn't make any difference in the world.\n\nIt feels like she has no base level of security within herself and has to constantly depend upon my mental state and me being in whatever mood to provide comfort for her to feel good. Some part of me refuses to believe that me never having been insecure and controlling in the way she sometimes is has anything to do with the fact that she gives me more comfort and security than i give her, and i am increasingly becoming more angry and sad.\n\nSometimes she says that the fact that I'm so happy and self-secure is that she provides that for me, but i know to the bottom of my heart that this is not the case (of course to an extent as far as romantic partners and life partners go, but you understand). I truly regret expressing my love for my friend, it was incredibly stupid to do,but this just feels like something different and i don't know what to do.\n\nThank you for reading.",

I think you\u2019re going to need it",

    "postText": "I (F26) started seeing this guy (M30) last week. We matched on a dating app so I told him I wanted to get to know him a bit before we started dating officially. We met a couple of times before we became exclusive. \n\nHe's smart and cool and he's spent most of\nhis life abroad so he's not most of the guys I've gone out with.\n\nI like that he's very open-minded, smart, and\nfeminist. The latter is especially rare in my society.\n\nBut because it's so rare, this guy is extremely\nimpressed with all that I've done to smash the\npatriarchy. The first time we met, I told him about the past year of my life which has been all about defying patriarchal traditions and taking life into my own hands. Very few people in my country live the way that I do and that's been a hurdle for me in my dating\nlife because there's not a huge chance of me getting married to somebody from my country on account of my history.\nNow, I've known this guy a little over a week and we've only just started going out. I'm very happy. He's incredible. But he's also saying things like wanting to get serious and introducing me to his family. He says he wants this to turn into something real.\n\nI've told him we can't think about that before the three-month mark but then I'm also scared because I was very severely abused by one of my exes, who also drunkenly told me that he wanted to marry me on the fourth date. And abusers will typically start off the relationship with love bombing. \n\nShould I be scared? What do you all make of this?",

    "postText": "hi. so last saturday was our mutual friend\u2019s graduation party. my bf originally didn\u2019t want to go, but i persuaded him to go and he reluctantly agreed. there were drinks at the party, so to \u201cget through it\u201d he decided to drink one too many beers and got very drunk. he started arguing with me because my two friends were driving home with us and the two other people that drove with us because there wasn\u2019t enough room for them. then he just started saying like crazy stuff like \u201ci don\u2019t care if a girl hits me i\u2019m hitting her back my hands are bisexual\u201d and also he said the n-word in front of this girl i\u2019m friends with who is black and i was mortified and just so embarrassed. \n\n\nanyways on the ride home i had to sit on his lap because there were too many people in the car and he just starts again saying stupid drunk asshole shit and we get at a red light and he pushes me off of him and i fall onto my two friends next to us and he leaves the car and slams the door. then after he left he started calling me and i told him i need a minute and i can\u2019t talk to him because i was trying to process everything that happened. \n\nthen he\u2019s threatening to fuck other girls and this and that. and i\u2019m ignoring him at this point and talking to my friends that are giving me advice and he\u2019s saying go hang out with jeffrey (my ex) go fuck jeffrey this and that, then he finds the street i\u2019m at on life-360 and says i suggest you leave this street or else i\u2019m coming and causing a scene. then he threatened to send my nudes to my parents cause i wasn\u2019t answering him and generally acting so insane. \n\n\nthis isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s acted crazy when he\u2019s drunk. in the past, he\u2019s lied about getting jumped to me when he was drunk and had me up till 2am crying cause i was worried about his safety. then he\u2019s also said that he loves another girl more than me when he was drunk. i honestly just got so fed with his actions and i broke up with him the night of the graduation party. it\u2019s now been two days later and he\u2019s written me many sincere apologies. i\u2019ve FaceTimed him and he\u2019s just been crying to me saying he has no one (he has a rough family life) and i feel really bad. he also said how can you break up so easily after dating and loving each other for nearly a year. he is my first love and i\u2019ll always love him but i just can\u2019t deal with it anymore. we\u2019re also both going to college three hours apart which is more of a reason why i wanna end things. i just feel bad, i don\u2019t know why. after he left the card and pushed me a light switch kind of just went off in me and i lost all respect for him. he\u2019s taking this a lot harder than me when i didn\u2019t think he would care that much to save this relationship. idk please help",

I certainly don't like how nasty some of the threats are - *when* you break up with him remember that nasty shit he said and prepare yourself for him to get nasty.\n\nYou don't have to be drawn into discussing the reasons for the breakup with him.  Just tell him its over, you're breaking up with him and the relationship just isnt working for you anymore.  Throw in a \"Besides, we're both heading to different colleges\" and leave it at that. Have your exit planned and leave. No good will come of it if you stay to talk to him or answer his questions of \"Why?\" or \"I can change\" or \"What did I do?\"",

So in a sense, he\u2019s choosing to be this belligerent racist asshole who doesn\u2019t care about you at all. \n\nSo yes, go ahead and break up.",

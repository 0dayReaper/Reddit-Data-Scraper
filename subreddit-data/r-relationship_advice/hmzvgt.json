I wrote this a couple days ago but couldn\u2019t post it because it was too soon. \n\nMy husband came home at around 6 o\u2019clock, and after he had something to eat I took him to the bedroom to talk. \n\nI sat him down on the bed and told him I was worried about him. I didn\u2019t know exactly how to phrase my worries so I just showed him my original post. \n\nWhen he finished reading the post he starting crying, like full on crying. In all the years that I have known this man, I had never seen a tear roll down his eye. I held him for a few minutes until he could recompose himself, and he told me everything. \n\nHe told me that the world was in a \u201cshitty place\u201d right now, and that we\u2019re bringing a child into a stressful time. \n\nHe said when I became pregnant he felt he had to step up. He needed to take care of things because it was his responsibility. \n\nHe said that the weight of carrying the family was so much harder than he anticipated so he thought if he \u201cdoubled down\u201d he could get through it. But the more he tried the \u201cdarker the tunnel got\u201d and eventually he couldn\u2019t see an end. \n\nHe said that he feels like he\u2019s \u201cconstantly drowning, and the only breath of fresh air is on the car ride between home and work.\u201d\n\nHe said that sometimes the stress is so much that he throws up, but doesn\u2019t tell anyone and instead keeps going with his day. He then pulled out a pack of gum from his pocket and said \u201cthis was for when it happens.\u201d\n\nI asked him why he couldn\u2019t tell me any of this, and he said he didn\u2019t want to \u201cburden me with the truth.\u201d\n\nHe said that, he thought if he told me everything, that I would stop seeing him as a \u201cprotecter and provider\u201d, and that I would inevitably stop loving him. \n\nHearing him say that brought tears to my eyes because I didn\u2019t know where he got the notion I would feel that way. \n\nI asked him if he wanted to quit his job but surprisingly he said the job doesn\u2019t bother him. He said the work in of it self was fine. It\u2019s just now he feels an added weight to provide because not only was he fortunate enough to keep his job in the pandemic, but we also had a kid on the way. \n\nHe said that some days he feels like packing a suit case and running to some tropical island for a week and not telling anyone. But then he feels guilty and doubles down even more. \n\nI told him that maybe he should go on a trip. I said that he deserved a break, and maybe if he did exactly that he\u2019d feel better. He tried to protest, but I insisted. In the end said that he\u2019ll only go, if we go together. Like a romantic get away between spouses. \n\nOnce things start to clear up and before the baby is due, he wants to take a week off from work, drop the kids off at Grandma\u2019s house and have us go on a vacation. Just the two of us, like we used to when we first got married. \n\nHe also said he wants to take the day off tomorrow and just sleep in, so that\u2019s the plan. I\u2019ll call his boss tomorrow and say that he\u2019s sick and can\u2019t come in, it\u2019s not like they\u2019ll make a sick man come in to work. There\u2019s a pandemic going on :). \n\nRight now he\u2019s playing with the kids and it doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s doing one of his chores. He actually seems to be enjoying himself.\n\nFor the first time in months I don\u2019t see the robot, I see my husband.\n\nEdit: Hey everyone, I want to thank you all for the support. I read all of your comments, and I appreciate all of you. \n\nI didn\u2019t expect this to get so much traction, so I want to clarify some things. \n\nFirst things first, my husband says hi. \n\n1.  I wanted to clarify about the chores people are taking about. I want to say that I know as a SAHM the bulk of chores goes to me. I cook and clean and do laundry because I know it\u2019s my responsibility. My husband\u2019s only chores are doing dishes, vacuuming every three days, and a few other \u201chouse maintenance\u201d stuff. \n\n2. I did in fact call in sick for my husband, but I made sure that I said he had a migraine. I saw on google that it wasn\u2019t a symptom of COVID if it was an isolated symptom. His boss was okay with it and said he can come back whenever he feels better. \n\n3. The pregnancy wasn\u2019t an accident. We both did want to have 3 kids because we were both raised in 3 kid families. We actively tried for the first 2, but for baby number 3 it was kind of a \u201cif it happens it happens\u201d kind of thing. We\u2019re both happy with the amount of kids we have/ will have and are hopefully done. We are not considering abortion nor adoption. \n\n4. We realize that a one week vacation isn\u2019t enough to get rid of his stress and are both trying to come up with a solution that alleviates his stress in a more sustainable way. Right now we\u2019re thinking about setting up an hour or 2 a day that\u2019s, \u201cdaddy\u2019s time.\u201d No kids, no me, no work. Just for him to relax. \n\n5. To those of you who think this fake; there isn\u2019t any way I can change your minds about this situation so I\u2019m not really too bothered. I just hope you this never happens to you guys. \n\nYou all have been supportive and really a wonderful bunch of people. I really think we can get through this, and it wouldn\u2019t have been possible without you guys. \n\nI\u2019m not going to reply to comments because, like last time, it\u2019s an overwhelming amount. But just know I\u2019m reading these as they come in. \n\nGoodnight everyone, it\u2019s been great.",

I actually felt a bit emotional reading this so well done.\n\nI think a break from work is a big one and its very hard to work out whether the stress coming from the job is simply he's working to much or that the specific company is burdening him.\n\nA day off followed by a week away with no responsibility so he can recharge his batteries is well due but i think after that week knowing what feelings going back to work has will be the key to whether he should be looking for another company. If all he feels is dread then looking for a job whilst remaining at the company will give him a new take on life. Its a scary thought, especially if hes been there a while and/or gained ranks but even a lateral move should help his mental health.\n\nIn general i think youve now set tje tone that you two can discuss these things and work to positive outcomes and it sounds like you've got the material for a long happy marriage, i wish you well in everything in the future.",

I don't know what would've happened if I hadn't taken that time.  People are overworked and overwhelmed as it is--when you add in a global pandemic it increases the stress more than most people realize.  It's like no one is relaxed.   I'm so glad OP's husband finally felt okay to open up to her.  I hope he gets the time off that he needs.",

Having a day off here and there and doing absolutely nothing work related on those days (not counting the weekend, that's different), has helped me quite a bit.",

Talking with a therapist helped me connect with the people I love and they support my mental state.\n\nWhen the isolation of self-quarantine was getting to me again, I started talking to my therapist again, and he helped me re-center and find ways to reconnect with my friends and supporters again, while still being self-quarantined.\n\nThe second time was easier, as I had learned better when to realize I needed to talk with someone.\n\nOP, now that your husband knows he can talk to you, and perhaps a therapist. It will be much easier on both of you.",

                    "comment": "I'm just hijacking this top comment because I want to tell OP that A) this is a lot more common than most people think, and B) both of you should really look into prioritizing your mental health.  **It is crucial to continue to work and focus on our mental health even - and maybe especially - when we're not struggling with it because that's when you have the mental and emotional clarity to ensure it stays that way.**  Just like people who stop taking their medication when they *feel better* leads to even greater episodes when they crash again, if you don't prioritize your mental health when you feel perfectly fine, you're setting yourself up for a crash where it becomes *impossible* to prioritize your mental health because it is already compromised. \n\nThat means setting up a plan ahead of time, figuring out what signs and symptoms are early indicators, figure out how to quickly destress, take frequent \"no-work\" weekends and draw a **hard** line between work and home life.  \n\nThis is not just advice for people with other mental health conditions - this is for **everyone**. \n\nWe live in an extraordinarily stressful age.  No matter what your opinions are, we live in a politically polarized, economically and mentally unpredictable and frightening age.  Understand that.  Respect that.  Know that it's not your fault.  And most of us are not even properly processing it.  Culturally, men are conditioned to be stoic, to put their needs aside and protect and provide for their family, and to be \"a rock\". \n\nThis is not a super healthy way to live.  Not even in times of peace.  But *especially* not in times of sudden stress.  COVID hit us so fast, and disrupted our lives so substantially, that we haven't had time to adjust our feelings and reactions to it.  It was just here, overnight, and we're still trying to live our lives the way we used to, when that's ust not an option. It results in men stacking stress atop stress until the brain literally just collapses and results in your husband reacting the way he did. \n\nStress *kills*.  I know this is a cliche and I know we all pretend to understand that, but we don't.  It *literally* kills you.  And before it kills you, it will transform you into a different person.  People don't understand the true implications of that.  But what you're describing about your husband can happen to *any* of us.  Its just biochemistry.  Stress will eat your mind until it takes your life.  Take it *seriously*. \n\nI know it isn't easy to do so.  We do not live in a country that takes this seriously.  Most of the Western, modernized world doesn't take this seriously.  And so we are, as a people, unhealthy, and unhappy, and have an actually downward trending life expectancy. \n\nSo it may sometimes feel \"weird\" to prioritize your mental health.  You may get a little pushback from an employer or friends.  **Ignore them**.  This is your life.  This is your health.  You need to put it *first*, above promotions, above work.  Everything else in life comes *after* protecting your sanity and mental health, because without *that*, nothing else is possible.  \n\nThis has been happening all across the US, at least, and the fact that he was so substantially improved by taking a vacation just demonstrates that you need to focus on substantial and meaningful rest and relaxation.  You need to take it as often as possible, and to treat it not like a *luxury*, but as a *medical necessity*.  Because it is.  Often we ourselves are not even aware when our mental health is deteriorating, or why.  But many times its because stress slowly eats away at us.  \n\nMake sure he understands this, and I would strongly recommend you both develop some kind of plan to help check in on each other, your stress levels, and to take sick days and vacation days when they are available and necessary. \n\nAmerica in particular had an unhealthy relationship with work *before* the pandemic - and now adding that on top of an unhealthy work-life balance has just exacerbated the problem.\n\nI can tell you that I - and a lot of people I know - experienced very similar situations.  I was feeling lost, overwhelmed, unable to do my job.  I work from home now, which I thought would make working much easier - but instead it felt like I was never getting away from work.  It was always there now, and we didn't even have children or the additional stressors you mentioned your husband having. \n\nI can tell you that *the day* I told management I was taking vacation time, I literally felt like a different person.  It was remarkable.  Just the sheer weight off my mental load was astounding. \n\nAnd like I mentioned, this is very, very common for so many people out there.  If you are a man experiencing this it doesn't mean you're weak or bad or unworthy or any of the other absurd labels culture has taught you to put on yourself.  It means you're a healthy person in very difficult times who needs the right tools to stay healthy.  We wear masks and PPE in public to prevent getting infected.  We need PPE for our minds to help us stay healthy through difficult times. \n\n*Especially* for men - do not try and tough your way through this.  It is not noble or admirable.  Do not go it alone.  The *best possible thing* you can do for your family is seek help and retain your mental health.  You  may  not think your stress affects you but your family *can tell*.  They know when you withdraw, they know when you're bottling up and not dealing with your stress.  If you legitimately want to help your family, *take care of yourself* so that you can take care of them.\n\nI know we're all ambitious, we're all worried about staying employed as layoffs pile up, but remember that you can't help yourself or your families when your mental health is not stable.  Better to need to be looking for a job but mentally healthy, than working yourself into a state where your mental health collapses, which can lead to serious consequences.",

We go see a general health practitioner even when we're 100% healthy because they have the skills to diagnose us and either confirm we're healthy or recognize something concerning and do something about it before we *become* unhealthy. \n\nThe same is true for therapy.  Going to a therapist **does not mean you have a problem**.  It means you recognize your mental health is one of the most valuable things you possess and that you are going to someone whose job it is to help you *preserve* it.  We take mental health for granted but any of us can have an issue with it.  Like any other health issues, mental health issues can be acute or chronic.  You can have a bout of depression that's not \"clinical\" depression but still a very difficult thing to deal with and you deserve to have someone who can help you understand what you're going through, why, and how to make it easier for you and your loved ones.\n\nWe *are* our own minds and so **we do not realize when we're losing control or things are going wrong**.  Our brain does not like to admit it has a problem.  Our brains will deceive and lie to us. \n\nTherapists are there to listen to you describe your current situation.  They can point out things like, \"it sounds like you are more stressed than normal.  Have you considered taking a mental health day?\"\n\nMost companies have policies *mandating* that sick days can be used for \"mental health days\".  That means you **do not need to be bedridden with the flu to use a sick day**.  You can use it when things are getting a little bit too much to handle and you need a day of mental decompression and relaxation.  Therapists can write notes to your workplace explaining that they recommended this course of action and they will back you up if you need them.\n\nThese are basic human needs.  Believe me when I tell you that your mental health is *everything*.  It is the source of happiness.  It is the ability to carry out your dreams.  To care for others.  All of it comes from mental health. \n\nTherapists don't judge, and you don't need to have an illness to see one.  Not every therapist is right for you.  Shop around until you find one who clicks and see them every six months, or a year, just to check in.  It's worth it.",

Also there are so many things that I learned in therapy that I never would have learned unless I had a major mental health crisis that threw my whole life off track. It took me ages to realize my depression was a real issue because I always thought I could handle it myself. But just like you said if your own brain is having issues, your brain can't fix it on it's own!\n\nPeople should be taught these skills before they have a crisis! Things like emotional regulation, learning to challenge cognitive distortions, interrupting automatic negative thoughts, and so much more. I wish mental wellness courses were more common in schools and that there was less stigma around mental health and more equity and access to good therapists.\n\nTherapy has done more than just help my mental health, it's made me such a better person to everyone in my life. The best thing OP's husband could do to provide for his family is to go to a therapist who will actively teach him reduce stress and manage his feelings.",

It's literally a box you put bread in and depress a lever to heat that bread up.  But *that* comes with an instruction manual.\n\nTo think that the human brain - the most sophisticated, powerful computer ever created to our knowledge in the known universe - doesn't need any sort of advanced instruction or assistance for us to operate is crazy. \n\nTherapy is about helping us understand how our minds work the way they do and troubleshoot issues.  Psychology and neuroscience has brought us fascinating and exceedingly valuable insights into the human mind that were not available to us before. \n\nEveryone could benefit from and live an *even better life* by finding a good therapist to help them negotiate difficult situations.",

Good on OP for being concerned but not suspicious like so many posts can be, and taking his mental state seriously. Great qualities all around in this relationship, its refreshing.\n\n\nTagging a note on here for others, burnout is harsh. If you work somewhere with sick days or PTO, take mental health days. You don't need to be throwing up to be sick. Some people don't get that luxury and it really is a shame, but if you can, do. If you start to feel burnt often and don't want to call out, schedule one day off in the middle of the week once a month. \n\n\nOnce every month or so if I wake up and just feel burnt, exhausted or stressed, I call out sick and it's been doing wonders. You cant push through burnout, you have to take time and reset but that's hard to realize when you're already so tired. It's easy to think you're *just* tired. Take the day off and chill. The first time or two might feel awkward or stressful because you're not used to missing work just to be out, but that's also a problem. \n\nI like to use those days to clean my apartment, sleep, and cook. Before the lockdown I'd go sit in a cafe downtown that I like for an hour or so and have the white noise of people doing their own thing help ground me and break up the monotony of my day to day interactions.",

I never noticed it until we all started working from home.\n\n\nHe wakes up at 6 and starts working. He just doesn't leave the room. Breakfast, lunch and teatime all while working. Works through the day, maybe gets off for a bit at 6PM to video call grandma (we live in another country and she basically lives alone so it's more of a chore for him I feel), and then right back to work. Meetings are done for the day so now he's answering emails. I am quite a vocal person, but I say maybe 10 sentences to him all day, even though we both stay home now. \n\n\nAfter _maybe_ actually stopping at 9, it's dinner time. My mom likes watching tv while they eat and she tries hard to find something they'd both like, but he never really watches tv. Left to his own devices, he'll go to the bedroom and just scroll FB until bedtime. He is the sole breadwinner and has expressed dismay to me and my brother that our mom doesn't work. Maybe he feels like his only reason for existance is being a living moneyprinter dor me, my brother, my mom, his mom, and a bunch more people.\n\n\nMy mom has also expressed that she barely speaks to him all day. I so think that she technically _should_ get a job now that me and bro are grown up, but honestly she has no work experience and that would probably not work out. I have a feeling she feels this way too, because she gets very defensive about it. Maybe she feels that she can't help out even though she wants to?\n\n\nI feel really bad for him. He often tells me \"5 more years and you'll have tour own life, and I can die in peace :)\" and I hate it because he's basically telling me that me and bro are the only reason he's still alive. In our culture, mental health isn't really a thing so I've asked many times for my parents to go to couples therapy or for him to go to a psycologist but nothing comes of it. \n\n\nFuck this system. Fuck the company CEO and owners getting rich off my dad's suffering. I just want to see my family happy.",

Though times have changed a little, many men are still in the mindset that it's up to us to provide, it's up to us to protect, and it's up to us to never show emotion. I grew up very much in a household that taught that and it's lead to a lot of problems and i'm only in my late 20s. It's like it's ingrained into our very nature that we should be doing all those things, it's what was taught to us in school as well. If we aren't strong and don't provide then we are weak and worthless.",

He handles the special needs kids with respect and compassion for their problems.  He picks up extra shifts and duties in his company and prides himself on being the go-to guy when there's a problem.\n\nHe's also home way more than I am, and deals with far less stress, so he takes care of most of the housework and cooking.

My plan was to do it at 50, but I'm 35 now, and I have the resources to try, so I'm gonna give it a shot for a minute. \n\nWhen I'm done with that, I'm gonna take the money I'm setting aside in an index fund and open a bar/restaurant. \n\nThat's the plan for now, but I'm not tied to it.

His first frantic thoughts are figuring out how to beg to keep his job.",

There is a lot of very unhealthy expectations of men and women that can work on us without us even realizing it's happening. But particularly when it comes to men feeling able to express vulnerability this can cause incredible damage to men and to everyone else in their life, since vulnerability is the only pathway toward openness, growth, love, and all the other positive things we can get to experience in life.\n\nMen are taught to shut off their uncomfortable/negative feelings. When your husband describes \"doubling down\", what's really happening is he's gritting his teeth and trying to numb his feelings because the stress is so unbearable for him. However, when he numbs himself to the stress, he's also numbing himself to you, his kids, and other ways he might be able to actually experience joy and relieve that stress.\n\nIn the short term a vacation is a brilliant idea, and I'm so glad that you both were able to resolve this situation. Long term, this may happen again, perhaps over and over again, and that's okay, but a vacation may not always help and/or may not even be possible. Long term the challenge for him will be to unlearn these things about men, and for him to find ways to stop numbing himself to the stress so that he can remain open to experiencing the joy in his life. This will involve wearing his stress and his negative feelings more openly, and unlearning that a \"strong man\" must outwardly seem impervious to these things.",

Most men feel this way and go their entire life never saying it because we feel like it's out duty to be a protector and provider, and that if we fall short we are a failure without worth. Some people will deny that these are the pressures out on men, but I promise you your husband had to be *really* stressed to say what he said, imo.\n\nI think it's awesome you guys have this kind of relationship, where you care enough to sit down and ask, and he cares enough to be honest and tell.

    "postText": "Reddit I need some insight, I don\u2019t know what is true anymore. Sorry for my english, it is not my first language.\nIf you guys say that I am in the wrong I will accept it and try to change.\n\nSo where do I start, in April I talked to my bf that I am unhappy about 2 things. His unrational resentment towards my job, and always working at home and never having any fun.\n\nLet me explain, anything fun is a waste of time in his eyes if it doesn\u2019t benefit you in a business way or cleans the apartment\u2026.\nSo on our days off we never do anything except for work, clean or work on stuff on our terrace\u2026because you cannot waste time going for a walk for example, when there is so much to do at home.\n\nOk ever since I said that I am not happy with those 2 things, life has become hell!! We fight all the time and last time he said he feels like a loser because I said that I am not happy and he feels inferior.\n\nSo to today. I had my wisdomteeth removed on the right side last Tuesday. My life has been hell for a week. Extreme pain 24/7, Cannot sleep or eat. Well today they finally found that it is infected and purulent and I have to take antibiotics.\nWe are leaving for a sailing trip on the 22nd and last time I had to take antibiotics I had a bad reaction with going into the sunlight. \n\nSo I told him that I have to be careful in the sun on our trip.\nHe said that I should just take a higher dose now in the beginning and fade it out faster. I told him that I am good and will take it as the doctor prescribed.\n\nWell now he is mad because he is not an idiot and he knows a few things about medicine(he is a lawyer). \nI pretty straight forward told him that I will do what the doctor says and not what he thinks is right and I am not his guineapig.\n\nHe came home an hour ago and didn\u2019t even say hi.\nI asked him if he is really upset because i won\u2019t listen to him but to my doctor?\nHe said that he is not upset but he has made up his mind and I should think about how I treat him.\n\nRemember I am still in tremendous pain and am now sleeping on the couch.\n\nPlease reddit help me figure this out \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

That doesn't give me any magical insight into medicine. If you need an explanation about civil procedure, sure I can help and sure I have an ego that makes me think I know everything but I don't. And neither does he, and if he's going to have a fit anytime you don't listen to his ego, that's a huge red flag.\n\nIf you are only allowed to do work together, and not experience any sort of personal joy, that's wildly controlling and miserable. Why would you want to stay with him? And that too is a massive red flag.\n\nFinally, he's punishing you for your surgery? That's controlling and dickish behavior and again a big old mayday's worth of red flags.",

Do you own a home that requires work? If you don\u2019t like maintaining a home, then home ownership isn\u2019t for you, and your bf doing it all the time so you have a nice home is called being a responsible homeowner.  Now, that doesn\u2019t mean OCD scrub and mop any time someone breathes, but weekends in my household growing up where my mother and father worked the week, was time to clean the house, mow the yard, wash the cars, etc., and most all of that was done Saturday so Sunday we could do some relaxing, and then during the week, nobody had to spend extra time cleaning or doing anything after a long day of work. \n\nWhen all chores are done, and the house is spotless\u2026what do you do?  You\u2019re so vague about this it doesn\u2019t make any sense.  Extrapolate please\u2026\n\nFar as his reactions, they don\u2019t make much sense either aside from maybe he just feels worthless since the things he\u2019s working hard for, you are saying you\u2019re unhappy with.\n\nThe medicine thing just sounds like him making a suggestion, and then taking it too far saying shit like he knows X or Y or Z\u2014if he\u2019s a lawyer he knows not to give medical advice or claim to have medical knowledge.  He just is frustrated overall from the other shit, and using a bad opportunity to bring it up.  I feel like if you said \u201cI know you\u2019re offering help, but I\u2019m in a situation with my teeth because I already did something wrong to let it get infected, I don\u2019t want to take any chances with the trip being so close, it has nothing to do with your advice\u201d\u2026and now I\u2019ve gotta ask\u2026you\u2019ve taken this medicine before? You know for certain it will have a reaction?  Higher SPF sunblock may help\u2014something you should\u2019ve talked to your doctor about, not your BF, which again, is confusing.  But if it wasn\u2019t the doctor or meds shit, it would be something else he\u2019d use to shoehorn in his frustration.\n\nAll in all, again, need more info on your living arrangements, jobs, schedules, house duties/chores, what gets chosen in free time, how free time comes about, etc\u2026",

What does he plan to do when he\u2019s achieved his work goal and\u2014I\u2019m assuming\u2014retired early enough to still be considered \u201cyoung\u201d?  No kids in this future picture?  You cannot \u201cnot do things\u201d with children because he\u2019s a grouch, or workaholic, and it can\u2019t just be you doing everything with the kids.\n\nIdk\u2026like\u2026if he\u2019s working his ass off to buy a house, retire early, etc etc, so you guys *can* do all those fun things then that\u2019s one thing, but that doesn\u2019t sound like this.  This sounds like he has quite literally no interests, and won\u2019t even entertain any of yours.\n\nSo again I say\u2014you guys aren\u2019t compatible I don\u2019t think.  You need to tell him you can\u2019t just not do anything the rest of your life while the world continues to go on outside.  I don\u2019t think this is something you can compromise on either, so idk about him suggesting he can do whatever all the sudden.  Unless he\u2019s hiding his interests from you because he\u2019s embarrassed or something,",

Don't waste any more time staying with a buzzkill like that. It's okay to relax once in a while.\n\nEDIT: I read further. If your partner has any reaction to your pain other than asking what they can do to help you feel better, then there's a problem. He has no respect for you, and he's arrogant enough to think that he knows better than your doctor, and he's not even a doctor himself.\n\nBreak up.",

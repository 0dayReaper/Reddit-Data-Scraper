    "postText": "My boyfriend and I have been dating for nearly 4 years now and for the past 6 months we haven't been on the same page. We fight over little things and they typically don't get resolved until 3-5 days later. We are also long distance (&gt;5 hours drive) so I think that has something to do with how badly we communicate during arguments.\n\nI get frustrated with him a lot because I feel that he doesn't truly understands me. There are times when he comes to visit or I go visit him and things are great and I feel like we can make it, but things get bad again when we're apart and we're fighting again. With each fight, I often wonder what it would be like if we broke things off because I think that we both deserve better. I'm conflicted and I'm hesitant to rip the bandage because we looked at engagement rings together early this year and he has already bought it and has plans to propose in the future. I'm close to his family and they also know about this plan so I'm torn because I know they would feel blindsided if we were to break up.\n\nI love him and I want to see where this goes, at the same time this is hard on the both of us and I'm not sure if this is just us sticking it out because we're afraid of starting all over again.",

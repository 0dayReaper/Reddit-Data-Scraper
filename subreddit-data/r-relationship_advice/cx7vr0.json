    "postText": "My fiance proposed to me about 8 months ago. We decided on having a relatively small wedding which is in two days. Everything was going great. He seems absolutely perfect and we are very much in love.\n\nI am a virgin and so is he, he wanted to save it for marriage and I wasn't fussed so I agreed to saving it. He has told me earlier that in his family the father checks the virginity of the bride the night before the wedding. I laughed this off as it seriously sounds like a massive joke. No turns out he was dead serious. He wants me, the night before to open my legs up in a small ceremony type thing so his dad can check me while him, his brothers and uncle can watch so that they know I am still 'pure'.\n\nI told him fat chance I am going to do that and he was begging to me to go through with it and how important it is for him. He said he knew it was slightly embarrassing for me but his mom did and it will prove how much I love him and that I have nothing to hide anyway as I am still a virgin. I left and he was crying, it was very dramatic tbh.\n\nI want to call off the whole wedding because of this and never talk to him again. But at the same time its only one thing and other then that we are genuinely perfect for each other and I dont want to spend my life with anyone else and it is very important to him and his family.\n\nWhat the frick frack do I do. I am currently at my friends house and I might stay here for the night. tomorrow would be our last day as an unmarried couple and I am straight up panicking.",

He can go marry his mom if he wants someone who is comfortable with this strange tradition. \n\nOr, he can offer to show his taint to all of your mom, aunt, sister, etc. Its only \"slightly embarrassing\", right?\n\nIn all honesty this sounds borderline cult-ish.\n If you really wanna marry this man you should not allow him to push you into something you are uncomfortable with, it would be a very bad start to the marriage. \nYou're 22 and inexperienced sexually so from that information there's a chance this will be your first experience showing your genitals to someone who is not a medical professional. Do you really want those people to be all your fiance's immediate male family members?",

                    "comment": "If this SEXUAL ASSAULT is slightly embarrassing, I\u2019m scared to think of what he would consider to be a legitimate sacrifice during their marriage. How far would he go? He and his family very clearly have no respect for boundaries (or women), so I can only imagine things getting worse.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: there\u2019s some confusion as to whether this should be considered a form of sexual assault. I\u2019m editing this comment to clear up why I make that claim.\n\nFirstly, virginity testing is considered a human rights violation by the UN, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch to say that a human rights violation with an explicitly sexual nature would be considered sexual assault.  See [\u2018Virginity testing\u2019: a human rights violation, with no scientific basis - UN](https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/10/1023401) \n\nSecondly, he\u2019s not just asking her. He\u2019s using manipulative language (\u201cif you loved me\u201d), as well as continuing to ask her and dismissing her feelings by telling her his mother went ahead and did it, to pressure her into going along with it. She\u2019s made her discomfort clear but he\u2019s still persisting that she put up with this. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s all that controversial to say that giving consent under pressure or coercion isn\u2019t truly consent.\n\nWhittling someone down is a form of coercion. By bringing up that his mother was okay with it, he\u2019s subtly telling her that her boundary is unreasonable. And while it\u2019s true that she is in a position to say no (in fact, she already has said no), the fact that he\u2019s trying to pressure her into changing that no into a yes is what makes it coercion, and no, threat of physical harm is not needed for sexual coercion: [womenshealth. gov](https://www.womenshealth.gov/relationships-and-safety/other-types/sexual-coercion) \n\nAdd on that if she doesn\u2019t go through with it, she basically has to break off her relationship days before the wedding, we can reasonably understand why she may feel like she has to go along with it. Granted, I think breaking off the relationship would be for the best, but that doesn\u2019t make what he\u2019s requesting okay.",

I knew immediately what had happened because my mother gave me 'the talk' when I was younger than that. \n\nANYWAY... we all get the point. And yeah, bicycles are *really* common one. \n\n&gt;P.S.

This has to be some kind of sex cult and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019d be expected to \u201cservice\u201d other male family members. He waited until 2 days before the wedding to divulge this expectation to her, what other expectations are the fianc\u00e9 and his family keeping from her? I\u2019d nope out of this so fast you\u2019d think my ass was on fire.",

End of story.\n\nAnd honestly, in a culture clash, personal autonomy wins every time.\n\n He *had* to know you weren't going to be cool with it. If not, he's an idiot and you should run. If he did know, he's a jerk and you should run.\n\nSomeone that's going to ask that *is never going to be a good spouse*. You really, really, really do not want to be legally, emotionally, or culturally tied to a person like that. What happens when you have kids and he's still that person? Do you want to have that fight? Because if he thinks it's acceptable now, he'll pull something similar later on.\n\nYou having had sex or not is completely *not* the issue. It isn't even any of his business, but I get that it might be important to you, so no need to go there. But, even if you ignore how invasive and rude this \"tradition\" is, him requesting it is a major red flag of a lack of trust.\n\nAnd you want to know the major reason it's total bull crap? You can't tell if someone has had sex just by looking. The hymen can remain in place and intact after sex. Not only that, but some women don't have enough of one to detect to begin with. Those that do *very* often have it damaged just by doing things like riding a bicycle. His dad could be a *gynecologist*, and he still wouldn't be able to be certain.\n\nYou aren't property. You aren't some kind of trophy. You're a human being with the right to body autonomy. Your \"virginity\", or lack thereof it's none of their damn business. \n\nYou *do not* want to be tied to this family.",

            "comment": "Wow. I'm pretty sure I would cancel a wedding if my SO asked me to let his father grope my naked vagina for any reason. But especially for NO reason. Because this is literally NO reason. That's not \"slightly embarrassing\" that's deeply humiliating and degrading. \n\n\nFirst of all, a woman's value as a person, wife, and partner is not related to her virginity. The idea of virgins being \"pure\" implies that non-virgins are contaminated and dirty, which is a gross toxic attitude. Even if you were not a virgin, you would still be a beautiful, complex, valuable person with lots to contribute to the world. If having sex could change that in the slightest, you'd also change and be \"dirty\" after consummation of your marriage. Dick doesn't change who you are as a person, regardless of it being marriage dick or free range dick. \n\n\nSecond of all, there is no way to physically examine a woman to determine whether or not she has had sex. Hymenal tissue is not even present in all infants. For those individuals born with hymenal tissue, many will have fragile membranes that wear away before puberty from normal childhood play, growing, walking, etc. Many more will have medium-strength tissue that wears away from more vigorous activities like running, swimming, bicycling, or sports. For people whose hymen is sturdy enough to withstand these activities, it may be strong enough to withstand sex and it will be present for years and years of sex, simply stretching to accommodate penetration. It may wear away later in life due to hormonal changes weakening the tissue, but it may not. Hymens almost NEVER \"break\" because they're too delicate to have that much tension. They usually just kind of dissolve, or stretch to accommodate activities. \n\n\nThird, good ol' dad probably has no idea what to even look for. Even if your hymen is present, he's very likely to not recognize it. He is likely to be looking for a membrane across the opening. Instead, around 90% of hymens are just a little tissue fringe at the bottom of the opening. [This diagram](https://images.app.goo.gl/zxgxjSpqKKqmDaek7) shows the different types of hymen. The top left is the typical presentation, the top middle is frequently what it looks like in adults who have worn away most of the tissue and just have a few vestiges remaining. Top right is also fairly normal. The bottom six types account for around 10% of hymens, and usually require medical intervention if still present at puberty. The bottom 3 are so uncommon they account for less than 1000 per year. Yet, those are probably what those guys are expecting you to have. These bottom 6 are the kind that can possibly \"break\" if they are strong and survive long enough for sexual activity to begin, and if the penetrating partner is forceful about entry. However, sex that results in an actually broken hymen also usually results in the need for emergency medical care, because the hymen should have been surgically removed before sex was an option. \n\n\nFinally, the fact that he even ASKED shows a massive lack of respect for you, and a level of distrust that does not indicate readiness for marriage. It's so appalling that he even mentioned it and I hope he quickly realizes what he just did and apologizes profusely. You don't deserve this, especially on the eve of what should be one of the happiest moments of your life.\n\n\n\nEdit: OMFG I just saw that he wants you to do this in front of ALL the male family?!

The only reason that it is painful and tears when you have intercourse the first time, is because most people are not prepared, you're body isn't lubricated enough, and the male just forces himself right on in despite that, which causes pain, and tearing. Sex should NEVER BE PAINFUL even when you are first having it. Pain is NOT normal. I'm not saying the first time is mind blowing and can't be uncomfortable at first, even a bit awkward, but it should NOT be painful if you take your time and go slow and get your body ready first. So all bleeding after sex shows, is that either you, or your partner, rushed shit, and you were hurt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeep in mind that in many parts of the world, young girls and women are literally stoned to death for not having intact hymens, because cultures are so misinformed as to what it actually is. Where are you from exactly? Where is his family from? Because unless you're in some part of the world where this is common practice, I'd be seriously questioning even more what the obsession with this is. \n\nI don't care how many tears someone shed, submitting myself to an embarrassing exam by my would be spouse's father AND ALL OF HIS MALE RELATIVES is a line in the sand that I would not cross. You were right to leave, and right to question the relationship. This is a HUGE invasion of privacy and a violation of trust if he's unwilling to marry you until it's done. That shows a lack of respect for you as a woman, you as an individual, and a lack of trust for you as a partner, and that is unacceptable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRun. Cut your losses. As much as that hurts, as much as it sucks, do you really want to marry a man that doesn't respect or trust you enough that he's trying to crocodile tear you into agreeing to let yourself be essentially violated by your future father in law and ALL OF HIS MALE RELATIVES?",

I would touch marrying him with a ten foot pole. Do you really want to be a part of a family that in 2019 does something like this as a tradition? It\u2019s not even medically accurate. It sounds like something the Salemites would do in between burning \u201cwitches.\u201d",

It is not just 'only one thing'. It's an unbelievable violation and it's a crime. Do NOT do it.\n\nHonestly, run a mile from this family who thinks you need to be assaulted to prove your love and worth, and never look back.",

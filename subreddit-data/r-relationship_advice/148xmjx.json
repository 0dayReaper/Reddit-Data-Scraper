    "postText": "I (19m) and my girlfriend (22f) were planning to do something I\u2019ve been looking forward to for a while, I had decided to bring it up earlier and discuss it more and she\u2019s decided now maybe isn\u2019t the right time for it. I was a bit disappointed so when asked why she says it has a history and bad memories without much further explanation. I didn\u2019t try to pry much after this as she didn\u2019t wanna speak about it but it\u2019s honestly been bothering me. I like to think she\u2019s been quite open with me when it comes to the past as We\u2019ve been together for just over a year so her not wanting to talk about is was surprising for me. My curiosity isn\u2019t helping me but I am trying to respect her feelings and not bring it up again or pry anymore than I already have. \n\n\nTLDR- want to respect my partners decision not to talk about certain things but how can I stop it from bothering me?",

Tell her you\u2019re always here for her and then let it go. \n\nYou did t go into detail about what you were excited to get so I\u2019m assuming it was a specific sex act. Even if she didn\u2019t have a past she could change her mind and owe you no further explanation. \n\nTry not to get hung up on this.",

    "postText": "I just got together with my bf after three months of dating and today I scheduled an appointment to get an IUS (intrauterine device) fitted.\n\nI'm super scared because there are quite some horror stories out there and there are possible short-and long-term side effects. I'm worried I'll faint or experience bad pain. I'm also scared of medical procedure in general and going alone.\n\nWhen I told him I had made the appointment, his reaction was \"Don't feel pressure to do it for me\". While this is a sweet sentiment, I think he doesn't understand why I am getting an IUS. I am not doing it for him not to wear condoms anymore, I am doing this to reduce my monthly anxiety. \n\nI don't think he understands why I'm scared or how the procedure works and the side effects associated with it. I kind of want him to research about it more, be empathetic and to be there on the day.\n\nAm I expecting way too much from him? Should I ask a friend to come or stop over reacting and go by myself?\n\nHow do you guys talk to your SO's about this stuff and what can you expect from each other?\n\nAny tips on how to ask him??\n\nI would really love some input from y'all!",

If you want him to research it independently,  you probably  need to give him a clue. His not doing so isn't necessarily an indication of apathy, but expecting you are capable of making an informed decision about your own health and body.",

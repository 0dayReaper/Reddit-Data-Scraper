    "postText": "For most of my life I was just raised by my mother, since my father left us when I was 3, and we are very close. My mom has always been vague about the details of the divorce, just that it was very painful and sudden, and that he never had interest in getting custody of me. \n\nA couple months ago I was going through documents looking for my birth certificate, and I came across their divorce papers. Surprisingly, my mom was listed as the one who filed for divorce, contradicting her story that he left us. I figured there must have been a reason for this, like him being abusive, but I know that my mom is sensitive about the topic so I didn't want to bring it up. I asked my aunt, her sister, but I was just told to drop it. \n\nIt's been bugging me, so I found him on Facebook. His profile was completely private, but his profile picture showed him with a little boy, who must be my brother. I found his business email online, and against my better judgement I emailed him asking if he would like to meet for coffee. He agreed. \n\nLast week we met, and he was completely not what I was expecting. He was THRILLED to see me, almost cried, and wanted to hear everything I had been up to for the past 15 years. I asked why he left, and that's when I got his side of the story:\n\nTowards the end of their marriage, my father confessed to my mom that he is bisexual, and that during high school and college he had a serious boyfriend. He was ashamed of his sexuality, which was why he hid it from my more traditional mom. My mom was angry, but didn't divorce him because of it. After the divorce he began dating his boyfriend again, and my mom freaked out over me being \"exposed\" to this. My mom petitioned for full custody, and was granted it. Over the years my father has attempted to reach out to my mom about me, but she has never budged. \n\nI asked my mom about what really happened, no bullshit. I told her dad's side of the story, and she tearfully admitted that it was true. She insists it was not out of anger or bigotry, but because she genuinely believed that it was best for me to stay with her. \n\nI am just so shocked still. She lied to me for years, making me think my own father did not want me. My dad and I are reconnecting now, but I have missed so much. Next week I am going to meet his husband and my 7 year old brother. I live with my mom, but I can't speak to her right now. She is begging me to forgive her, but I'm so angry and I don't know how I'll ever not be angry with her.",

I would also like to second the advise of letting your emotions have their time and allow your feelings the space and time you need them to. Complete that with not making rash or hasty decisions and I'm more than sure that you'll make it through this in a much less bad way than many other options. I would also like to express my heartfelt compassion for what you're having to deal with and at the same time I really hope you're not letting the negative emotions stain the positive experiences of reconnecting with the other part of your family!\nAll the best and I hope that you, as far as possible, get an enjoyable Christmas!",

            "comment": "This actually one story on this sub I can attest to. My wife kind of has a similar story to yours. Her parents got married and had her. When she was like a year old her parents got a divorce because her dad was gay. Her father was from Brazil and was here for school. He had limited contact with my wife when she was growing up from like 3-7 years old, but one day he \u201cdisappeared\u201d according to my mother in law. My mother in-law said that he didn\u2019t want her and wanted nothing to do with her. Years go by, my wife grows up thinking her dad didn\u2019t love her didn\u2019t want anything with her until one day, when she\u2019s like 18 gets a text from a random number saying it\u2019s her dad. Turns out that her dad was deported back to Brazil because he had over stayed his visa and because of American immigration law, since he overstayed the visa, can\u2019t come back to America. He had also been trying to reach out to my wife for her entire childhood, sending birthday, Christmas, just saying hi, sending it to my mother in laws phone because my mother in law wouldn\u2019t give him my wife\u2019s number. So he sent her screen shots of all of this showing that her dad really did care about her and that her mom hadn\u2019t let him have any contact. My wife confronted her mom and they haven\u2019t had the same relationship since. My wife and her dad on the other hand have got super close and talk on FaceTime and the phone at least once a week. They\u2019re trying to figure out how to meet up. All that time say, catch up with your dad. Make up for lost time. Don\u2019t hold what your mom did against your dad. As for your mom, your relationship probably is gonna change with her. I know for my wife she doesn\u2019t have a lot of trust in anything that her mom says and the only time we go over to their house is to see her siblings, but that kind of lie will do that. I really hope you and your dad have a great time catching up and that you don\u2019t hold it against him!",

You're basically grieving two parents: the dad you could have had growing up, and the mom you thought you had. That's an immense shock for anyone to deal with, so of course you might get overwhelmed. You might get super angry. You might get intensely sad. You might even feel nothing towards either of your parents. Anything can happen in this time and that's okay. As long as you're not being harmful or cruel to yourself or others, it's all fine. Grief is very personal, so no one gets to tell you what you should or shouldn't be feeling. If you want to, it could be helpful to write letters. To your mom, to your dad, maybe even to your new sibling, or even to yourself. Writing helps you process things and may help clear your mind a little. You don't have to send them if you don't want, but you could use them as a starting point to open the conversation if you're ready to do so.",

Only the people around us can decide if those mistakes are forgivable.

Obama was elected president shortly after that in in 2008. Most **decent** adults my age or younger held neutral or accepting views on gay relationships by 2005. Of course as time has gone on that percentage has increased but your mother never tried to fix what she did.\n\nNow you know the truth about what happened and your mother is upset and begging for \u201cforgiveness\u201d.

I'm a 25 year old woman and it's been 10 years since my mother forced me back into the closet and forced me into straight sexual encounters that I wasn't comfortable with to earn back her 'love' and 'trust'. She made contact with my little brothers who I had a major role in raising dependent on me having to identify as straight because she viewed who I was as disgusting and immoral. She accused of me child abuse at one point solely based on me being bi and having a girlfriend. \n\n\nBut because she's my mother some people think I should forgive and forget. That she was just upset and looking out for me... by causing me heartache and trauma, I guess. She's made excuses about worrying about my future and how my 'gayness' would negatively impact my ability to be a parent because she still feels that same sex couples shouldn't raise children because she feels its immoral and would mess up the kids.\n\n\nThe people that say that mothers love their children unconditionally and are always just trying to do right by them aren't helping victims of abuse or homophobia in cases like these.\n\n\n Furthermore, excusing behaviors based in bigotry as ignorance that deserves compassion and someone of the group being discriminated  against to teach and lead by a positive example is just putting the burden entirely on the shoulders of marginalized people. Yes, of course, LGBT people should strive to be good and empathetic people, but so should everyone else. It's not our job to stop whatever we're doing to gently correct bigots and take the abuse to show that we're good people.",

I mean gosh the last time he reached out was 2017, don\u2019t you remember reasonable people still fearing homosexuality to the point that they\u2019d deny a father a relationship with his daughter then?

Calling your friend a stupid bitch during a heated argument is a mistake. **Consistently denying your daughter a relationship with her father for 15 years is not a fucking mistake! It is outright, inexcusable, disgustingly selfish, bigotry.**\n\nOP, your mom did not \u201cmake a mistake\u201d. And even if she did, she has had multiple opportunities over the last 15 years to rectify that mistake. What she has done is horrible. Truly, truly horrible.

There are only two victims here: you and your father. And your mother is the victimizer.",

At any point during those 15 years, she could have relented and told the truth, but she was thinking more about herself than the well-being of her daughter, at least, that's assuming that at some point before she was outright confronted with it that she came to an understanding that it was wrong.\n\nForgive, but don't forget.  Perhaps it is just one really big mistake, and for a myriad of reasons outside her mother's control it just never got dealt with, but OP definitely shouldn't walk out of this situation with a blind trust of her mother until her mother earns it back.  I'm a single hetero white male, so I can't really speak to being a minority in any way, but I'm a dad and the idea that a child was kept from their father for 15 years infuriates me.  When you go to court, things get pretty much set in stone, and there are probably a lot of cases where things need to be re-evaluated because attitudes have changed, but it's just heartbreaking that mom didn't come around an own up and make it right until it blew up in her face - the reality is, she may have kept this up for a lifetime if she was permitted to.\n\nNot just hating on mom here - if it were me in dad's position, I would have also taken her back to court over and over - but the reality is that the court system drains you of both money and faith, and he likely felt extremely defeated, especially considering the other struggles he was likely facing to be accepted for who he is.

She continually kept him away. It's like in The Notebook (SPOILER ALERT) where the parents freak out and take Allie away from Noah. But the mom continues to throw his letters away for a full year so she never knows he kept writing her. The initial freakout, okay, but continuing to keep your dad from you is the part that you need to focus on. Yes, you were a minor, but you had EVERY RIGHT to know your dad wanted to see you.\n\nLiving under her roof is making this an awkward thing to figure out. By going ahead and meeting your dad and his family, you're at least taking control back. I wouldn't worry about the future with your mom right now but rather focus on this new relationship with your dad and be honest and true with your feelings. If you're mad, just be mad.

I don't see why he wouldn't have like emailed OP or contacted OP on Facebook or anything. In almost all cases a parent can't unilaterally forbid the other parent from contacting a child at all. Like, even parents in jail have rights...\n\nAnd where was the dad's family in all of this? Even if they cut out the dad for being lgbt, they'd generally still want to see the grandson.",

I find it nearly impossible to believe that a court would agree to a total lack of contact - some states have even asserted that a rapist has the right to see the children that result from it.  That's a very very different scenario than just custody. What OP is describing are just not the actions of a man who desperately wants to see and have a relationship with his child.\n\ne: and to be clear, the mother's a terrible person, that's indisputable. but i think it's extremely shady that the father is claiming it's solely on the mother that they didn't have a relationship, when it seems as though he didn't fight for one like at all. i think OP should be very careful about trusting his motives for suddenly appearing back in her life.",

But you deserve to be angry with her for however long you feel it, and you deserve to tell her the reason for your anger. Don't accept explanations or excuses. Wait for a sincere apology.",

It's used daily to gaslight victims of abuse into staying with, or going back, to their abusers.\n\nIt is used to paper over acts of immense cruelty; to minimize the feelings of hurt and betrayal legitimately felt by the targets of those cruelties; and to shame and belittle those who dare speak up or do something about their abusers and the abuse they are subjected to.\n\nFamily is just people, and like other people, they're a mix of the good and the bad; the ones beneficial or detrimental to your physical or psychological health; and the ones worth keeping or worth getting rid of. The fact that you share a little more DNA with some people in no way obligates you to give them a pass on being shitty to you.\n\nWould you keep a rotten banana around just because you share 60+% of your DNA with it? Hopefully you wouldn't.",

Seems like you handled yourself very well and have found a father who has wanted to know you this whole time! Now you have more family to love and support you! \n\nI agree, I think time and space is what is best for your relationship with your mom. She may have done what she thought was best, but this is a huge lie that she continued to tell til you found the truth on your own. It's going to take time to work through this on your own before you can really start talking to her and, hopefully, being able to repair the relationship with her. \n\nFor now I would want to focus on the possibility of learning who your father is (which may be difficult as well) and spending time with his husband and son! Seems like there's a few positives that have come out of this and may be beat to focus on those while you work through what your mother did.\n\nI hope that everything works out for you!! \u2764",

Imagine marrying someone and you realized that they hid something as central to a relationship as their sexuality. You would feel incredibly betrayed.\n\nAlso look at it this way. Your dad may have been ashamed of his sexuality, but it was a completely dick move not disclosing it to HIS FUTURE LIFE PARTNER. What the fuck? If I found out my wife was a lesbian after marrying her I would be furious. Not because she is a lesbian but because SHE LIED TO ME.\n\nSo yes you can be mad at your mom for keeping you away from your dad, but look at it in a way where she is a woman who was pretty betrayed by her life partner. And now because of it you're going to abandon her too? Poor woman.",

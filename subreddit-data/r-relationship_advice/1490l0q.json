    "postText": "My boyfriend (24M) and I (20F) have been dating for over a year now. usually everyday after work he will call me and we will chat. i will either be driving or home, my schedule is kind of different everyday, but he has a normal 9-5 so it kind of became our routine. i realized from dating him he really loves and needs his \u201cme time\u201d which i completely understand. because of this, i let him text/call me first. unless i need to ask or talk to him about something i wont randomly text/call him cuz im bored when hes working. i have a job too so i will be busy most times too. anyway today i had texted him but he was busy so i just told him to text me later. i had a long drive from work to my friends house so the last 15 mins of my drive i texted him to see if he was done with work. (it had been 3 hours since the last text i sent and it was past 5 already) he told me he was driving home so i gave him a call. he was being a little dry with me so after i said \u201cso if i didnt call you werent gonna talk to me idgi\u201d and he said \u201csorry i wanted to listen to music on my drive home for once\u201d \n\nI let it go and he texted me later asking if i wanted him to come over and i said yes. he hits me with the \"after our phone call today i realized i've been calling you everyday after work like im on a schedule\" this hit me out of no where and i was so shocked. i didnt know our conversations after work made it feel like a chore to him. i dont know why he thinks im gonna be upset if he wants to listen to music while driving. he made it seem like i dont give him personal space which i completely do. we argued a little and i was really hurt. i wont go into detail but he was like \"i just want it to happen naturally\" \n\nin my head, we have been dating over a year and talk to eachother after work just to reflect on our day. i thought it was all natural. i dont annoy him. i asked him if im clingy or annoying he said no. i said i dont bother you at work he said no you dont. but continues to tell me he feels like hes on a schedule. i dont understand where to go from here. i told him if hes forcing himself to talk to me and be in this relationship then dont be with me but he still claiming he wouldve left me long ago if that was the case and that he loves me and stuff. i really love him and think hes a great guy however i cant comprehend why he would say this if he doesnt want to end the relationship. Advice?\n\ntldr: boyfriend tells me he feels like talking to me everyday is like a schedule",

            "comment": "As a guy who has been in a similar position as your boyfriend, let me explain my thought process when these kinds of conversations would come up. There was a point in my relationship where I spent so much time with my SO that I began to resent the time I had with them, which is shitty, yes, but it's how I felt, and I definitely needed and enjoyed all of the alone time that I had. It wasn't necessarily that I lost feelings at first, I just wanted time to be away from them and do my own thing. The problem is that the mixture of both \"my time\" and \"our time\" begins to take a toll if it keeps going on for a long period of time. I began to enjoy the time I was by myself and my friends rather than the time I was with them, and eventually it made me want to distance myself from the relationship, which ultimately led to them getting hurt and me chasing after them.\n\nThe point is, if he treats the time that you both call, text, or even see each other as a chore rather than a necessity for the relationship, then it's difficult to assume that it's something that will last. Regardless, it all depends on the effort that HE puts in first, especially if you're feeling like this after a year of dating. You're not a chore, you're a normal person who just wants to keep up with your SO's life, and there's nothing wrong with that. If you, yourself, want to make it work, then put in as much effort in understanding his feelings and space as you can. Beyond that, it's up to him to make the effort in understanding your needs and feelings.",

Clearly he feels like you\u2019ll be upset or disappointed if he doesn\u2019t talk to you. The way he\u2019s saying things sounds like he\u2019s been bottling it up and it\u2019s becoming overwhelming for him. Talk to him and let him talk without you saying much. he needs to understand that you are perfectly fine with him having his me time and he needs to be honest with you about it.",

You need to listen to him and be rational about it. I couldn\u2019t be with my gf if I was telling her about how I am feeling and she got upset. Just talk to him casually. For example: \nHim: I feel like talking to your has become a chore\nYou: I am sorry! I don\u2019t want you to feel that way at all. What do you think you should do that will help? What do you think I should do to make you not feel this way? \n\nListen to understand his feelings, not to have a reaction.",

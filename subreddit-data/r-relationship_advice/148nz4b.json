    "postText": "This is probably a common problem maybe? Idk if it\u2019s my self-esteem or something other people experience. \n\nTldr; I feel weird enjoying sex after showing my weird comfortable vulnerable side to my boyfriend.\n\nMy bf and I have been together 2 years. We are both goofy, awkward, laid back types and as our relationship has progressed naturally we have become very comfortable with each other to the point where I see him as my best friend. Again naturally, I\u2019ve stopped dressing up around him or being conscious of impressing him etc. I\u2019ve never been this vulnerable with anyone before. \n\nBut now for some reason I feel really awkward being \u201csexy\u201d with him. Maybe because he knows the real goofy, awkward, not always attractive type and I feel insecure? When we\u2019re together we are non-stop joking around. And now I\u2019m having a hard time expressing sexual enjoyment with him because\u2026.it feels\u2026.silly? IDK! This is the first normal relationship I\u2019ve ever had and I feel confused as to what this feeling is or how to fix it. Sex is really important to me and I feel like I can\u2019t enjoy it anymore.\n\n\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29",

Maybe you need to find what makes you sincerely feel sexy. \n\nIf you put on some lingerie that feels out of character and do something that doesn't fit \"you\" then it doesn't surprise me if you feel silly in that situation.  You need to figure out what sexy is to you. Bikini bottoms and a ripped t-shirt with the ribbing cut out of the neck so it's wide and hangs off your shoulder? Short shorts and a crop hoodie?  Skater dress? Your every day clothes, but whispering a dirty suggestion in his ear as you walk by and give it a gentle bite? Freshly painted nails casually dragged across his thigh during dinner or a movie? \n\nIt doesn't have to be traditional sexy, it has to make you personally feel sexy. You can have a fun, silly, friendly relationship,  and still turn a mood. Just find your own turning point.",

    "postText": "[og post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hqz54g/myf24_boyfriend_28_of_10_years_has_become/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nSo I found out he was cheating on me with an underaged girl.\n\nYesterday morning after confronted him and asked flat out if he cheated on me. He admitted that he had receive a blowjob from another woman. He said he blocked her on everything, but she kept creating instagram accounts to contact him. I asked why he hid this, and he said he was ashamed and was looking for the right time to say something. \n\nSomething in my gut told me he still was lying, so I snuck into his room and stole his phone while he showered, he forgot to take my thumbprint out of his phone. I looked at his most recent texts, and a few hours before he had texted an unnamed number, \u201cI told GF I was cheating on her, we might not be able to see each other for a while. If you need me message me on insta\u201d. I have never been so hurt by anything in my life, I felt my heart drop as I read the text, I looked at past texts and saw pictures of his dick and her body and him saying she looked better than me. \n\nI moved on to his Instagram, and like a lot of people said, he had a second one he used to dm women. I found a conversation with the girl he had been talking to that started in August 2019, and suggested he had been fucking her since October 2019. For at least one year of our relationship he was unfaithful. I checked the girls profile to see if she was better looking than me, and saw in her bio the name of a high school near us and C/O 2023. My stomach turned and I had to stop myself from throwing up. He was fucking a 15 year old girl. At that point I had seen enough and decided to leave the apartment. I screenshoted everything and sent it to myself. I went to my friends place where showed her everything. \n\nI felt so disgusted and guilty. A bunch of the people that commented on my first post spoke about how he groomed me, and I just now am realizing how right they were. If I hadn\u2019t let our relationship continue and told the other young girls what he did, it might\u2019ve stopped him from doing it to other girls. I refuse to look back at his Instagram because I don\u2019t want to know how many young girls I helped him either rape or abuse in some way. I feel so gross for defending him. I also feel disgusted by the fact that it\u2019s very likely I performed oral sex on him hours after he had slipped his dick into a high schooler. That evening we began the process of reporting him and hopefully he will be thrown under the jail very soon. I\u2019m going to try to do what I can to right the wrongs I did with this, and am planning to get an STI test and some therapy to get past this and raise my self esteem again.\n\nThanks for those of you that tried to help me.",

I just hadn\u2019t been as susceptible to the grooming, and he moved too soon I suppose.\n\nTurns out, his wife was a student the first year he taught HS, and when her parents found out, they agreed to keep the secret because he was a young teacher and they were going to get married.\n\nHe was 36 when he attacked me- so 12 years since he\u2019d started. It wasn\u2019t his wife\u2019s fault. It wasn\u2019t m friends fault. It wasn\u2019t mine.\n\nIt was all HIM. And i\u2019m your case, it\u2019s all your guy. Thank you for going to the police. We didn\u2019t have the nerve or support, and he got fired from ANOTHER HS before ending up at West Point. I would have loved to have gotten him out of teaching altogether.\n\nEdit: So we DID get him fired from our HS, but he was working one town over by the following Monday.",

But my friend had a much, much harder life than I did- she was raped by her stepbrother at age 11, and *moved in with the track coach and his family*. She went from one situation to another for years, but she is doing really really well now. I saw her in September and I wanted to bring it up- neither of us live in NY anymore but that\u2019s where we met up because of family- but I could tell she wouldn\u2019t want to dredge that up. I do wonder how many others are out there. I never told anyone what happened until I was 24 and ran into my guidance counselor in a bar, and he asked me what happened that this guy was just gone? *Everyone* knew *something* had happened. And since the two of us were always with him, on the field, at his home, in his car, even having our coffee in the teachers cafeteria- they knew it had *something* to do with us. The messed up thing was, I hung out in my counselors office constantly, he asked me why I was suddenly always late to school, suddenly skipping classes- but he never ever asked about Mr. V",

However, in this post there\u2019s policy reasons to NOT prosecute someone reporting a crime. We WANT to catch sexual predators. We don\u2019t want to make people afraid to try to report these things, or to turn evidence over to the police.

However, I still believe it is at least skeptical for an adult to be attracted to an under 16\n\n3. For the people giving hypothetical cases; of course there are some exceptions, such as an 18 and 17 year olds relationship, or a relationship that has gone on for years and passed that age barrier. My comment was in regards to adults that *actively seek out* 16 and unders for sexual reasons.\n\n4. Some people are just going too far to defend adults attraction to minors, even if the law says its okay, the law has said many horrific things are okay in the past.\nLaw does not equal morals.\n\nAnd people over 18 being attracted to under 16s is still creepy as hell",

He might give his niece gifts, give her back rubs, and teach her to want a guy that's like him. So they might say things like \"when you start dating, you want a real man that &lt;does thing the uncle does&gt;\", or \"we're a lot alike, we both are mature and intellectually curious\". These are kind of hamfisted examples but grooming takes place over a long time frame. You'll see it in action sometimes where the older person starts officially dating a person the moment they turn 18. Now there isn't technically anything wrong with dating an 18 year old, but the priming for that happened well before the official dating.",

It\u2019s only in recent years how disgusting I realized it was. My childhood was full of abuse and neglect but honestly, this sickens me the most out of everything my parents did. \n\nThe worst part is that I dated him for 5 years, he was emotionally abusive that entire time. It took me 5 whole years to open my fucking eyes and see it. When I broke up with him, one of the last things he said to me was that he had dark problems that he couldn\u2019t tell me about and I wonder if he was a closeted pedo. He committed suicide shortly after our break up. I try not to think about it anymore as I\u2019m trying to overcome all the shit but it sits in a dark little corner of my mind and it occasionally pops up. It\u2019s so fucked up man. Kids are stupid. I was stupid. And it\u2019s a parent\u2019s responsibility to teach their kids better. \n\nI see so many similar stories on reddit, it\u2019s heartbreaking.",

She\u2019s probably going to be really angry\u2014at you.\n\nShe\u2019s going to blame you for breaking up a \u201cgood relationship\u201d, hurl untruths at you, possibly say you\u2019re simply jealous of what they (she and your ex) had because you were being cheated on. I mean, I might be wrong, but just remember how you defended that guy in your original post\u2019s comment section. Imagine that but even more heated in some ways. She\u2019s young, she\u2019s in the middle of the honeymoon phase (and in the middle of his grooming), she doesn\u2019t have the suspicion that he\u2019s cheating on her\u2026 In fact, she knows he was cheating on someone *with* her, which can do a great deal in bolstering someone\u2019s self-esteem.\n\nI suppose what I\u2019m trying to say is your trial is just beginning. Perhaps talk to that new therapist about how you can help this girl or, at the very least, how you can keep from letting her hostility (if she exhibits any!) from getting to you. Because *anyone* who says you\u2019re not the victim, or you did the wrong thing, or you should have let him be, or that you unjustly ruined his life\u2026is so, so, SO wrong.\n\nIt might get hard to believe that at times, but you did the right thing, he deserves to be punished, and you deserve happiness. Surround yourself with people who believe the same. Take care of yourself OP! :)\n\nEDIT: fixed formatting",

Many times we don't \"miss\" them, we see them but we dismiss them because we think we're overreacting, we're being too paranoid etc.  We believe we know the person so obviously this can't be what's going on.  It's totally NORMAL to not immediately assume the worst of someone you love.  \n\nKeep in mind once you started seeing real evidence...your gut instinct started kicking in and raised your suspicions.  You started following that gut instinct that led you ultimately to the truth.  So don't blame yourself, when you were confronted with evidence you started taking action.\n\nFurthermore, it doesn't matter how long this went on, what matters is that YOU took action to put an end to it by reporting it.  Don't beat yourself up worrying about how many girls he did this to...instead think of how many potential victims you just saved from him by reporting him. \n\nWhat he did in the past is 100% on him.  The fact that he won't be able to do this to anyone else, that's on you!  You made a difference, don't beat yourself up!",

In fact it's because you did everything right in the relationship why people like this can get away with it you see?\n\nSo the way you are should not need to change. And there is nothing wrong with living by the rule of trust but verify. It's like I have written before..\n\nImplied trust is the standard for all relationships we have in our lives.

We were both just dumb kids.\n\n&gt;He wouldn\u2019t do that\n\n\"[Oh but he was the \"good kind of pedophile with restraint](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hqz54g/myf24_boyfriend_28_of_10_years_has_become/fy437ly/)\"!!\"   Who the hell believes this crap ?\n\n&gt;Something in my gut told me he still was lying, so I snuck into his room and stole his phone while he showered, he forgot to take my thumbprint out of his phone\n\n/r/thathappened \n\n\n\n[The OP is clearly a guy writing this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hqz54g/myf24_boyfriend_28_of_10_years_has_become/fy44s39/), he already slipped up stating he waited before **dating her** \n\n\n\nReminds me of the \"My boyfriend says he doesn't love me anymore because my chest is developing\" story from a couple of weeks ago\n\n**EDIT**: As requested here is the   /r/quityourbullshit full [analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hs8mjn/update_myf24_boyfriend28_if_10_years_has_become/fyap2rh/) \n\n**TL;DR:**   Foreshadowing username, the story was already written ahead of time, he already had access to IG but didn't find anything, creepy fanfiction details,  longest shower in the world and the fact that OP was responding to comments from part #1 the same day the shower happened and the same day they reported to the police.",

Couple things to note:  \n\n1) When we get cheated on and all the signs are there.... but we deflect, it's because denial is powerful.  You had all the signs.  Everyone responding knew the signs.  You just couldn't let yourself accept it.  Don't beat yourself up.  Many of us have been there.\n\n2) Your boyfriend has always had a thing for underage girls.  Granted, 18 vs 14 isn't nearly as bad as 28 vs 15, but statutory rape is statutory rape.  No matter how much you consented back then.\n\nGood luck moving forward.  Sorry you're dealing with this mess.",

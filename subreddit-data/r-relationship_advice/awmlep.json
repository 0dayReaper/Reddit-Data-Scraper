    "postText": "I appreciate all the feedback, most of you were nice. There was a few idiots telling me I needed to be Alpha and be more manly.. but whatever. \n\nAnyway the consensus with my RL friends was I needed to tell her. We do Brunch on Saturdays because she does Yoga Sundays so we met up this morning. \n\nI could barely eat and she could tell something was up. She got worried thinking I was going to say no or something worse so by the time we took a walk both of us were nervous wrecks. \n\nI sat her down and told her everything how I realized I was in love with her several years back but was to much of a chicken shit to come clean. I told her that I never said anything because I did not want to jeopardize our friendship. Her face turned white then a myriad of expressions came over her face then she started laughing till tears came down her face. \n\nI honestly was stunned, my stomach was in my throat and I honestly thought that almost 12 years of friendship were down the toilet.      Then she started crying, sobbing really  and she lightly hit my chest. She half laughed and sobbed that she was in love with me too but she thought that it would also impede the friendship we had and she wanted nothing to screw up what we have.\n\nWe hugged and I told her that there is no one on this earth I would want to have a child with but her. We talked for hours ,in fact I just got home. We have decided that we want to focus on us for now. I want us to be at that point that we can do it together. \n\nI know that this isn\u2019t a rom com, and that things could end up not working out  for us in the end. \n\nHowever I am pretty sure if there is such things as soulmates she is mine.\n\nThank you guys and gals for giving me the courage to tell her \n",

We still talk about our journey and laugh about it, and reflect on how fortunate we are to have each other with such a solid foundation. \n\nIn the end I was more terrified of being a missed opportunity and not knowing what we could\u2019ve been, more than I was afraid of anything else.

Except for the holding hands and the kiss at the end.\n\nI got to date my best friend for 6 years and while it didn\u2019t work out because we were both only 17 when we met and both had personal issues we let get out of hand, I\u2019d never trade those memories for anything- even if I knew I would have met the person I end up actually marrying in that time. \n\nWe can\u2019t be best friends anymore now we\u2019ve split because of some of the aforementioned issues, but it didn\u2019t ruin our friendship. Just last night she called me at 2am asking to be picked up and given guidance after she made a huge mistake. We still love each other, even though we aren\u2019t in love anymore. So you don\u2019t even need to worry about it ruining the friendship if the relationship doesn\u2019t work!\n\nTwo mature friends CAN fall in and out of love and still remain friends. I always tell people to stop worrying about what might break and go for it anyway!\n\nAnyways that\u2019s my unsolicited and possibly unhelpful advice. Your friends and lovers smiles are the greatest works of art a man can gaze upon. Enjoy being the one to make her smile. Nothing else in the world can replicate that warm puffy feeling in your chest you get when you see her smile and know that you\u2019re the one that made it happen. \n\nAnd just think, one day she\u2019ll have that kid, and it\u2019ll call you dad.",

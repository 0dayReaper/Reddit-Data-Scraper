    "postText": "I(20m) have a younger sister(6f) and she always hangs out with me whenever I\u2019m home.\n\nYesterday I was playing video games and she walks into my room crying. I ask her what\u2019s wrong and she said that our parents just told her that they regret having her. I confront my parents about it and they said that they find her extremely annoying and that if they knew that she would be like this they have aborted her.\n\nThe part that pisses me off the most is that the reason they think she is annoying is that she is mentally slow and often doesn\u2019t understand certain things. We got into an argument and afterwards my sister wouldn\u2019t leave my side. They want me moved out within 2 months but I don\u2019t know how my sister will handle not having me around to comfort her.\n\nI\u2019ve been extremely worried about leaving her due to the way she gets treated, what should I do",

Your parents may be willing to let your sister visit often or spend the weekend. \n\nChildren can grow up fine even if there's just one person who cares about them and makes them feel loved.",

I'm very aware of the statistics and am very proud to say the cycle of becoming a teen Mother has stopped at me. I could never put so much responsibility on her, it'd be so selfish of me to sit there and have children then not take the responsibility of raising them. \n\nI feel guilty running an errand &amp; leaving a couple kids home with her, I guess the difference is I know she's not my live in nanny she's my daughter and that's exactly how I treat her. Don't get me wrong it can get extremely convenient letting her babysit or allowing her to bathe the children or finish the cooking for me. Even washing the dishes or doing laundry but like I said there is a huge difference and a thin line between chores and motherhood and that line should never be crossed.\n\n\nI hope everything works out for all of you stepping up to that parent role. Wishing you and your siblings health and success.",

Things other people would\u2019ve been horrified at didn\u2019t faze me at all. My mother once told me I deserved my sexual assault because I didn\u2019t try on a dress she liked. I knew this wasn\u2019t cool... but abuse? My therapist helped me acknowledge this type of thing. And helped me acknowledge how completely traumatic less outright abusive things (like taking care of my sisters night and day, cooking dinner and doing laundry and dishes for the whole family very young, being totally on my own emotionally) were.\n\nIn short, go to therapy. A good therapist may take a couple tries to find. But they can change your life.",

As the now 30 y/o son of a single mom, from a highly toxic family (that refused to stay apart til my grandparents died)... Well a lot of that was sadly familiar. I was a mediator, a therapist/partner surrogate, an emotional punching bag and more before age 10. \n\nI knew back then it was bad, especially when I'd have the somewhat rare opportunity to see how other families behaved. It's worse in retrospect, and now I have a name for it. Here's to the work and healing ahead, and knowing I'll do whatever I can to prevent this from being the date of my future kids.",

My dad was an extremely abusive poly-drug addicted alcoholic, that would dissapear for days, weeks, months at a time. I can't tell you how often we would go with little to no food, except for meals at school. At one point, we lived on instant mashed potatoes, and canned pumpkin pie filling for months cause that's all we had. \n\nWhen my dad was home, he would beat me senseless, and say horrible shit to hurt me, just cause I looked exactly like my mother. Any time he tried to bet my sister's, I would step in and take the beatings for them. By the time I was getting ready to turn 14, I had had it, and I ran away. The cops found me and brought me back, and my hellacious life continued. Finally someone got through to CPS, and they put us in foster care. We got split up, and only saw each other a couple of times a year. As a result, we kinda lost that bond we had , and now as adults we only speak every now and then. \n\nThe only upside to the whole ordeal, was my shitty parents and shitty foster parents really went a long way in teaching me how not to parent my son. For that I'm grateful. As for the rest of it, my feeling is they can all go eat a bag of dicks.",

It stands for Adverse Childhood Experiences, and the idea that a single kind and caring person in a child's life can make up for quite a few adverse experiences such as: abuse, neglect, trauma, and even the divorce of parents. Studies have shown that having one caring adult in a child's life immensely helps them become a more functional adult. The idea behind the study of ACEs is that if you can intervene early in a child's life, their brain is more elastic and they're more capable of overcoming adversity. Whereas adults have a harder time forging new neural pathways.",

Before anyone was really using weed in a medicinal capacity. The man was a fkn genius. \n\nBut most of his life he spent in \"special\" schools. He didn't speak until he was 4 and even then just random sentences here and there. \n\nAfter he moved out of his mom's house when he was 19, he got his g.e.d. and began studying botany. Eventually he and everyone around him figured out he wasn't developmentally challenged at all--he had just been abused into literal muteness by his alcoholic/drug addicted mother and her various boyfriends, lovers, husbands, what have you.  \n\nHe was able to recover pretty well (although had his own issues with addiction, probably genetic, as I struggled with that too, fucking sucks), but not all of his siblings did. One died at 7 years old in a very suspicious car accident. Another committed suicide at 25. Another is currently living in a halfway house after doing 15 years for almost killing her husband. She can't form a coherent sentence. The last one has always had issues with his speech and literacy/comprehension on top of being constantly in trouble with the law and altogether just pretty \"out there\". His nickname since I was a little kid is \"Uncle Anonymous\", big oof. \n\nSo I fear for kids in environments like that. I've seen firsthand how it can really fuck them up. \n\nIt would be so helpful if OP could find a way to get his sister into any kind of therapy if she is not already. Maybe even to see if some of her handicaps could be helped by getting her away from the parents? Same goes for OP. Therapy and setting boundaries are good for anyone in a shitty situation like this.",

Though it is hard to say how bad this situation is, and maybe this bit of verbal abuse is just the tip of the abuse iceberg.  \n\nNot saying that he should not collect this evidence and what not but if his parents otherwise seem normal and have been decent people before this, he might want to talk to them about counseling and seeing someone about their attitude.  There are resources for them if they are struggling with raising a child with special needs.  It can be hard and this seems incredibly unforgivably outrageous but as always it is one side of the story and probably a bit exaggerated by the outrage of hearing your parents say something about how hard it is to raise someone with special needs.",

If you do, keep it to yourself! It's not hard to be a decent human being. I love my kid, and the truth is, when you have kids, it's a lottery, you don't know what you'll get so you better be ready for anything. I don't buy the \"It's so hard\" argument. Too many kids with disabilities are abused and even killed by their parents and instead of advocating for justice and care for the child, too many people just say, \"Well, raising a kid with a disability is sO sTrESsFuL\" as if that excuses their behavior.",

I can\u2019t imagine how traumatic it must be for a child to hear that she was unwanted, especially coming from your parents. Therapy will give her a safe space to talk about her feelings. You will also need to take care of your physical and mental health to take good care of her, so I\u2019d suggest therapy for you as well - if you gain custody, your life will change *radically,* and it might help to have a professional to guide you through it. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019re both going through this, and it breaks my heart a little. Your sister is very lucky to have a caring and supportive brother looking out for her wellbeing.",

And im not just jumping to extremes, i think after 18 years, your parents having a second child would be a whole different thing on them too. They truly werent ready or bothered to raise another child. At this point in their life, usually parents get older n wish they could have another kid or a grandchild to goo over.\n\n If they're not happy with her and she's mentally slow, her pre-teen and teen years will be hell. And they will probably kick her out as soon as she's 18 and who knows what kind of job pandemic we will have then, she's only in for a lifetime full of stress and troubles with emotional trauma that is only barely beginning.",

There are a wide variety of programs that people are referring to when they say \"CPS.\" One of them is voluntary for families that are requesting help either because they don't have the resources, are worried that their inability to parent properly will turn into abuse, or when the child is difficult to manage.\n\nWhat the person above was saying that the allegation might be \"screened out\" because there is no actual abuse or no proof that future abuse will occur. That is quite common. Contrary to popular belief, CPS is beholden to actual laws and those laws are complicated. They exist to protect both children and parents, both of whom have firm legal rights.\n\nIt's frustrating to read stories about \"CPS\" because either people are completely ignorant to what it is, or they cherry pick horror stories, or they choose to believe family members when they say \"CPS took my kids but I never did anything wrong!!!\" It's definitely a fucked system but so is everything else. The amount of kids that they help, given the level of disarray so many communities are in, is amazing",

My 17 year old nephew lives with me now, and my brothers main concern with him living with us was how he was going to be punished for running away to us. \n\nCPS doesn\u2019t take the kids away because they have a nice house, plenty of food, clean clothes, therapists, etc. but they\u2019re \u201chome schooled\u201d (my SIL works so she doesn\u2019t actually teach the kids, but that\u2019s not considered neglect in NC), my SIL hits the kids (but doesn\u2019t leave bruises), and my brother and SIL are verbally and emotionally abusive. But don\u2019t worry guys, they\u2019re just the BEST parents. 10/10. The kids only get hit because they deserve it. And the kids lie about getting hit. Because three kids would totally tell the same lie over years. \n\n\n\nThis turned into a giant rant but I guess I had to get it out. TLDR: CPS in military towns sucks and my brother literally thinks he\u2019s the worlds best dad even though CPS has been at his house many times. Sorry for ranting.",

She kept saying that if it doesn't stop, I'm going to be the one going to jail... what? Turns out, my mom told DCFS I hit her when I never even touched her. I was balling my eyes out.

Trying to push you out makes me worry about the potential for physical abuse if she displeases them. If you feel up to it, try for custody. Maybe look for a local special olympics coach to get her enrolled in an activity with other kids with needs. It would give her another adult to confide in if you aren\u2019t around. \nEdit to add that you need to contact her teachers. I worked in special education for years. I called CPS on parents who were abusive. They need to know and will keep tabs on her. Let her know that you trust her teachers and she can talk to them. Several kids didn\u2019t trust us at first but would open up when they warmed up to us. It\u2019s horrifying what they would go through because they were told that teachers were scary or mean.

That way, your sister will spend her days with people tasked with helping and caring for her and not at home \"annoying\" them. Your parents seem very selfish, so this may appeal to them. I don't know where you live, but you could even go so far as to find a good place for your sister to attend and also find out if there is financial assistance available (if your parents are low income). \n\nB. Are there grandparents alive? If there are, you could attempt to solicit their help. If nothing else, they could participate in some serious shaming of your parents. This is their child, not a bag of trash.\n\nI wish you good luck.",

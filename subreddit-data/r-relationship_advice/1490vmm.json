    "postText": "I went on a fifth date with a guy (32M) and I definitely was crushing.  \nFor context, before we ever met, we were both in early stages of dating other people as well. This came out early\u2026I think second date. We decided we\u2019d see how it went anyways.  \nOn the fourth date, I was kinda drunk and expressed some kinda flirty jealousy asking about her. I punned her name. He said something like \"if you don\u2019t want to know, you shouldn\u2019t ask.\" I thought about this later and realized he\u2019s right. It was hypocritical since I have someone else in the mix, and why was I doing that? What was I trying to get? I resolved that I would not bring it up again unless necessary, like trying to start a relationship. I wasn\u2019t quite yet \u2014 I wanted to get to know him first and presumably, he wanted the same.  \nNext time I saw him, he started using the mean spirited nickname for the girl that I had joked in the last date. I didn\u2019t not engage at all as I had changed my mind and decided its best to focus on us, not what going on outside of us. I gently changed subjects. Over the course of the night, he also brought up that his ex (another girl) had come over to his house earlier that day. Again, I acknowledged what he was saying but gently changed subjects.  \nThen he brought up that when he was on a date with other girl, he ran into another ex (a third girl!). Ok. Still, I didn\u2019t not engage too much. I listened, nodded, and moved on. I did not at any time mention other person I am dating. I did not pry for details about his. We both know our status \u2014 no need to go into details. It\u2019s all out there.  \nI don\u2019t remember how, but at some point, he said he wasn\u2019t ready to settle down. I got kinda annoyed by this. I said I didn\u2019t want to go down what I knew was a dead end. He said it wasn\u2019t a dead end. I didn\u2019t like this answer. I didn\u2019t like this conversation in general, because it was already established we were seeing other people. I was not in any way trying to \u201cescalate\u201d the relationship by any measure at the time this came up. It wqas actually kind of jarring. I said yeah I know we're both dating other people, I'm going on a first date soon. It seemed he really didn't like that. he straight up said that made him jealous. I had said this to basically show that I also wasn't actively trying to settle down, as he had just said.  \nI can\u2019t remember exactly how, but he brought up the other person I\u2019m seeing in this conversation as well. He also said he thinks about me when he masterbates\u2026. It was a convoluted. It got heated. He left in anger.\n\nI texted him a few minutes after that I thought we were going to have sex, and I still wanted to. He came back. But when he did, we just started arguing again. He said he was jealous of the other guy. I said I was annoyed he\u2019s acting like I\u2019m trying to settle down with him when I am seeing someone else and I know he is too. I just wanted to get to know each other and take it from there. I know this all sounds immature and bad but I actually kinda like this person. This argument was so bizarre. He ended up leaving a SECOND time \u2014 we didnt have sex. That was last night. No word today.  \nIs this over? Honestly would be open to not seeing the other people, but I kinda thought it would be a \u201ccross that bridge\u201d thing with him if we did end up clicking well as we got to know each other. But hes also telling me he doesn't want to settle down.  I', cool with us seeing other people. \n\nI just don\u2019t understand\u2026like what does this person want from me? Were it totally up to me, we\u2019d keep getting to know each other and leave things open ended. If it goes well cool. If not, we part ways. I can\u2019t tell \u2026 like is he trying to make me jealous about this other girl? And if so, why also say he\u2019s not ready to settle down? While also saying he masterbates to me? Wtf am i supposed to make of all this?",

But even grudge-f\\*cking you wasn't enough to get him to go home with you. You can't even comprehend how much a guy has to actively dislike you to pass up guaranteed sex. He may hit you up when one of his other girls falls through that night, but have some self respect and just preemptively block him. This is never going anywhere past some bedroom fun in the very best scenario for you.\n\nOf course he didn't want to settle down. He was never going to settle down or date you for more than a month or two. He's good looking enough to have a rotation and men in general are repulsed by women who date more than one guy at a time. It puts them directly into the recreational use only category.",

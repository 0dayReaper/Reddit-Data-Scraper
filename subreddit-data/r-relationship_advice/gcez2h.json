She also admitted that often times when she was saying she was working late in our home office what she actually meant was she was writing/drawing stuff and just wanted to be left alone.\n\nI told her i had no problem with her hobbies, which made her happy. She also told me that she is so embarrassed because a bunch of it is self inserts of her, and some of it would make me unhappy reading it. \n\nI asked her to show me, and she eventually agreed. I read some of it and it didn't bother me at all, (imo to me fantasizing about fictional characters isn't a huge deal as it is simply a fantasy and not real).    I asked if some of the things she writes are things that turns her on, and i told her i am willing to try anything at least once. \n\nYesterday night she actually sat down next to me, and started writing while i was next to her on the couch, and she didn't seem embarrassed at all anymore. So i guess this is good.\n\nThank you for your help.\n\nTL;DR; Me and my Fiancee were able to work things out, and she isn't so embarassed anymore about it, and is willing to share with me. Thanks for the advice!",

Some partners in the past have not been kind. You showed a maturity and a kindness to your fiancee that I'm sure speaks volumes in her mind. This is kind of communication and growth I wish more people had. Congrats.",

So I can completely understand that if she\u2019s making art that she\u2019s pouring herself into, that feeling is amplified by x100. Glad it seems to have worked out!",

I think it's really awesome that you can do it and I always looked up to the content creators back when I played the Sims way more than I do now.

I know it's hard to shut out the judgmental voices (whether imagined or real), but I don't think it's something to be ashamed of at all. As the above comment says, you're helping so many people enjoy these games. I've definitely been that giddy person downloading dozens of mods/cc at once, pretty much ruining my games with them because my computer couldn't handle the amount I had. But it was all worth it, and it was all thanks to the hard work of people like you. You're an artist; wear that label proudly!",

But from another perspective, especially if she's selling her work, that's just what sells. \n\nThere's such a huge market for it, and a lot of graphic artists and writers end up making sexual material because they can make some nice money that way. Nothing to be ashamed about there either.",

Sometimes with things like this, the closer you are to someone, the more reluctant you are to tell them. Becuase they're going be around you for a long time, and they'll always know. And you won't forget that they know. These days, while I don't mind letting people know that I'm like that, I never get into thd details. My best friend doesn't even know what my OTP is. I mean, she could probably figure it out pretty quickly, based on what I talk about, but even so. I haven't written fanfiction in a long time, but if I did, and someone saw it? I'd feel pretty humiliated. Even if they didn't find it cringey, I couldn't help feeling that they did, and... That could cause problems.\n\nEDIT: Thinking about it, I think too much information can actually get in the way of knowing someone. Like, if I share too much, people are not going to see me the way I see me. On the other hand, I think those qualities are visible without me needing to explicate them. I mean, while I won't get into exactly what I think, I can explicate what I like about character relationships, and it's obvious I'm emotionally involved. I can get into what shipping feels like, and the pluses and minuses involved. The one place I get into every last detail is my diaries, but those aren't meant to be read until I'm dead and buried and worms have consumed my flesh.",

This describes it perfectly! \nIt\u2019s like your own thoughts - everyone is allowed to have them and ones that don\u2019t affect other people, you don\u2019t have to share. \n\nAlso shipping and fan fiction can be something that isn\u2019t just about the content you write but the context of your life when you started writing or when you started enjoy a OTP. So just because someone has come into your life and been there for a long period of time - your enjoyment of a fandom may have been there much longer. \n\nMany people do keep it private because it isn\u2019t seen the same way in society as being a sports fan for example, but it sometimes requires much more dedication and effort!",

Like, there are romances that a lot of people get into, but for me... Edward and Bella? Meh. Jack and Rose? Whatever. A pairing from a kids' cartoon? This is a love story for the ages.\n\nI thinks this is because... Well, I'm mostly interested in animation, anyway, but I think there's more to it. For one, I think it has to do with the fact that romantic tension in kids' shows tends to develop out of friendship, which is how I work. And I think it also has to do with the fact that I define myself by an emotional core that hasn't changed much since I was a kid. There's a kind of honesty and vulnerability with younger characters that I identify with. Even if I'm different behaviorally, they act out things I feel inside -- jealousy, frustration -- that would be immature to show. When it comes to my OTP, I can tell you exactly what I like about the dynamic, and also why I relate strongly to both characters, in both core personality traits and circumstances. I can even explain why I fixate, what elements of my personality contribute to that. When I talk about things like that, I think it makes sense to people. That's still way different than fanfic, though.",

Except he used my real name, and the whole thing was such a cringefest, and the fact that he made this public, with full on descriptions of what I looked like, sounded like, my job etc. I felt so violated. Like he painted a nude of me without my permission and then displayed it in public.\n\nI wouldn't say I was unkind, but I told him to leave me out of this hobby, as the things he was writing about me were too personal. According to him, I was the focal point of a lot of his writing. I was horrified. What I didn't tell him was that it gave me major creep vibes, and that was basically the beginning of the end for us.",

However, I read it A LOT and that is not something I would just casually admit to people.  When I found out my friends read fanfic, I feel like it created a bond because even the good stuff was cringy af.  Let me tell you, it took a lot of work to find anything remotely good.   \n\n\nI am in no way trying to trash fanfic.  I definitely have a soft spot for it.  I was more trying to underline that a lot of times there\u2019s a sense of shame in reading and writing fanfic.  I would sometimes tell people I really felt I could trust that I read fanfic.  If I wrote it though, I would NEVER tell anyone about it - not even my closest confidant. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI certainly can\u2019t imagine not only writing raunchy fanfics, but also drawing pornographic images only for it to all come out in the open.  I would be beyond mortified and I probably wouldn\u2019t act well either because when people are embarrassed they often throw rationality out the window.  We aren\u2019t perfect. We aren\u2019t robots.  We are humans and humans make mistakes. What\u2019s important here is that they were able to cool off and have a heart to heart, which then, amazingly, resulted in her writing right next to her fianc\u00e9.  I think that\u2019s pretty cool.",

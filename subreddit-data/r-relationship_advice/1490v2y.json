    "postText": "I was seeing a girl for a few months. Things didn\u2019t work out. The connection was lost. No arguments or anything of that sort. She informed me she was seeing someone else so i said \u201cI think it\u2019s best to cut this off completely then sorry\u201d \u201cwish you best of luck\u201d however I do have some of her belongings and owe her for some designs she did for my company. We\u2019re both hard headed and can\u2019t see either of us reaching out to the one other first so wondering what my next step should be. I\u2019d like the pay her and drop her stuff off but want to respect her boundaries. Should I return her stuff or just donate it ?",

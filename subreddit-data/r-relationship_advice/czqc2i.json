Please, go ahead and \"depixelize\" it or whatever. \n\n#The other pixelized nudes are from a link about copyrighting your nudes. Please read the post before commenting.\n\nSo a couple things have happened in the last few days, and I figured you guys would like to hear what the police finally settled on.\n\nFirst, I'd like to clear up something first - the theft and distribution of this media was, in **no way, shape, or form**, the fault of my partner. He is just as much a victim of a crime as I am, if not more. This has been an emotionally tumultuous time for him. He is my partner and my foremost concern here is him. \n\nIt's honestly absolutely terrible that so many people blamed him for this situation.\n\nI spoke to a lawyer...and my Dad. The lawyer is my father's friend who is giving me advice for free. **If** this goes to court, he'll be representing us.\n\nAnyways. Monday, I got a call from a very polite female officer, asking if both my boyfriend and myself could come in to the station to make a criminal report. The first officer to phone me was mistaken - while this does fall under revenge porn, it doesn't fit \"sexploitation\". She would have had to actually coerce him into sex acts for that.\n\nIn my state, this is only a misdemeanor crime. *Fortunately*, it's a charge for every imaged stolen/shared. It also matters that there are two victims.\n\nThe police spoke to the people whose names I provided, most of which confirmed that Sarah had shared the photos. They'll be taking her phone as evidence and they'll ensure that the media is one hundred percent destroyed.\n\nThat all made both me and John happy, but as a lot of people pointed out, this stuff could easily already be on the internet.\n\n(All of this has been approved by my partner, before anyone asks)\n\nSo I turned around and submitted copyrights for *all of it*. I spent a shitton of money copyrighting over a hundred images and videos. Then I paid for a domain name and \"made\" a website - all it says is \"UNDER CONSTRUCTION\". Then I registered John and myself on several different pornographic media hosting sites and posted \"CONTENT PENDING COPYRIGHTS\".\n\nTHEN. I posted on Facebook.\n\n\"Recently, someone I consider a friend broke into John's phone and stole images. She then proceeded to share these images amongst some of my closest friends.\n\nNot only am I disappointed, hurt, and betrayed, but this person placed John in a very disturbing position - one where he had to defend himself from sexual assault accusations. This person DID NOT come to me with these concerns, deciding that she would rather gossip with others under the guise of \"concern\".\n\nHad I ACTUALLY been assaulted, this person would have been spreading horrible moments of my life to others, taking away my voice as a victim. How horrific, how absolutely *monstrous* does a person have to be to do something like that?\n\nIn actuality, this person stole intimate videos that were, in no way, intended for her. \"Stolen\" is the best word for this media because, well...\n\nMost of you know me as an entrepreneur; I own a small business, I pick up freelance jobs, I dabble in several money making ventures. None of this is a consistent income, so John and I have been brainstorming on how I could possibly generate a passive income. \n\nSo we started making pornographic media of a relatively popular kink. We had generated enough content to finally build an online following, and then our content was stolen and John's name was dragged through the dirt.\n\nShame on all of you who has participated in this shit flinging and pot stirring. \n\nBecause of this person and ALL who participated, I have had to out John and myself as sex workers. I've had to speak to the police, a lawyer, my goddamn DAD. Shame on all of you.\n\nFrom this point on, any person sharing these COPYRIGHTED images and videos will personally hear from my lawyer.\n\nIf anyone has legitimate concerns about my relationship, come to my goddamn face instead of spreading bullshit behind my back.\n\nThank you.\"\n\nSince then, I've been receiving non-stop calls and messages from people apologizing, asking questions, and, unsurprisingly, people are arguing about my expectation of privacy on Facebook.\n\nSarah tried to call but I hit ignore and texted her, \"You may contact my lawyer,\" and then gave her the number. She hasn't responded.\n\nAll in all, I'd say that things are looking up. Sarah is, rightfully, being charged with a crime or twelve. John's name is clear legally. Important people in my life know that I'm not being abused. \n\nPeople are reaching out to John to either apologize for misjudging the situation or to congratulate him on being a porn star.\n\nSo that's good, I guess.\n\nI want to thank everyone who gave me good advice and urged me to go to the police and speak to a lawyer. \n\nEdit: To everyone that is saying this is fake based on \"the timeline\", it *is* possible to speak to both a lawyer and the police in a four day period.\n\nI submitted the copyrights online from my bed.\n\nY'all are apparently just bad at adulting. I wasn't going to sit on my ass while my partner's name was sullied by horrible accusations.\n\nI was, an still am, angry. So I got shit done.\n\n*Edit edit*: **I am not releasing the videos.**\n\n**Another Edit**: Since everybody is up in arms about me submitting copyright claims, [this is where I got my information](https://saltyworld.net/how-to-copyright-your-nudes-to-avoid-revenge-porn/)\n\n#Final Edit:\n\nThis is getting out of hand so I'll be logging off. People asked for an update, so they got it.\n\nCopied from a comment I posted:\n\nNobody seems to understand that this isn't about getting Sarah arrested.\n\nMy lawyer told me that, no, John could not get in trouble for what we're doing and, yes, I could go ahead and post on Facebook to try to control the narrative. \n\nHe *did not* give me advice on the criminal case because my interest wasn't - and still isn't - the criminal case. As of now, I've achieved everything I wished to do. The police are going to ensure that the videos get deleted.\n\nI don't *give a fuck* if she's charged.",

It often doesn't happen because the victim's cooperation is generally key to getting enough evidence to go beyond reasonable doubt and therefore make it worth the prosecutor's time to do so, but it *can* happen... particularly in a case like this where there's \"proof\" of the \"crime,\" unless OP invalidates that presumption of guilt in some way.)\n\nI absolutely won't claim that I would have drafted a spin plan anywhere near as kickass as OP's, but if I'd been in her shoes, I would have immediately told anyone who had seen the images/videos that the acts were 100% consensual and planned, and how **fucking** ***livid*** I was that a so-called \"friend\" had violated my boyfriend's privacy by snooping through his phone and just *viewing* these items (or anything for that matter) in the first place, but then fucks up on a whole new level and violates me, him, and our entire goddamn relationship by choosing to spread not just *a description* of what she saw, but distributing the actual fucking *content* under the guise of some trumped up theory about a situation she knows nothing about?!  All without ever asking **me** about the situation directly?  Fuck her.\n\nIt takes a special kind of shitty person to do something like what OP's \"friend\" did, but a girlfriend who lets her boyfriend languish in a situation like this when she can clear it up isn't much better in my book.",

So I love explaining the law, and have [an app to help law students study in law school](https://www.barprepbuddy.com).\n\nA \"copyright\" is a type of protection over \"intellectual property\" (or \"IP\"). Where physical property (like land, cars, your laptop, etc.) is generally easy to protect, or at least prevent others from taking, IP is intangible and can easily be taken/copied/distributed.\n\nIn most of the world, the law supports the idea that someone has a right over their creative works. Poems, drawings, photos, books, etc. They take a lot of work to create, but they can easily be copied by others. In fact, copyrights help protect small artists against large companies that may have more money/infrastructure to distribute creative works.\n\nBecause copyrights are so important, most countries recognize that they are created the moment someone converts their creativity into a physical manifestation. In other words, if you have an idea for a book, the second you write it on paper or type it into your laptop, it is copyrighted. This means that no one else has a right to make a copy of your work without your permission.\n\nSo copyrights are born the moment you create something copyrightable. Legally, you have the right to prevent others from copying you (in the US, this is generally done through something known as the DMCA), and you also have the right to pursue damages... but it can be really hard to pursue damages. After all, it can be hard for the legal process to figure out who really owns an idea, who had it first, and whether or not someone **actually copied someone else**.\n\nBecause of this difficulty, the government offers a compromise: the **registered** copyright. Essentially, the government says, \"Hey, if you give us $35 and spend a little time registering your work with the federal government, it'll make it much easier for us to be sure what you own. In exchange, we will give you the right to sue people for more damages easier.\"\n\nSo in short, every creative work is inherently copyrighted, which gives its creator the ability to control who may copy/reproduce the creative work. And, in limited situations, this built-in copyright protection allows monetary damages. However, if the owner of the creative work *registers* the copyright, it unlocks more protections by making it more efficient to enforce the copyright.",

I was an artist before I became an attorney, so IP law is super fascinating to me. It also made it helpful when people started stealing my art lol.\n\n&gt;Do you happen to know if the case is the same for Canada?\n\nJust about [every country on Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries%27_copyright_lengths) (with a few exceptions) supports the idea that a copyright is created upon manifesting an idea into some sort of medium (i.e., ideas are not protectable, but ideas that are written down, or expressed in some way, are protectable). Where countries tend to vary has a lot to do with how long a copyright is enforceable and when a work becomes public domain.\n\nHowever, a bit of a twist: even though the US's DMCA law only technically/legally applies to US jurisdictions, because so much of the internet is wrapped around US tech/property, the DMCA can generally be used by non-US residents. In other words, it's not uncommon for someone in the UK to use the DMCA to take down infringement from someone in Canada even if the infringement isn't on a US server. It's become a sort of universal lowest hanging fruit for enforcement, for better or worse.\n\n&gt;P.S. your website is awesome and I think what you're doing is really cool!\n\nI really appreciate that! It's a passion project of mine that I'm really hoping takes off. I just launched it a few weeks ago and have a lot of content to create, but I'm getting a lot of great feedback so far :)",

Sarah is in for a shit ride over her actions and likely is gasping like a fish for air right now, having had the rug yanked out from under her so hard I hope it left carpet burns on her heels that never fade.\n\nAnd to the people who took her side, they can all go f\\*\\*k themselves. Seriously, I am the first to support someone if I feel they have been done wrong or crimes committed against them. But if someone showed me personal photos or videos of someone else saying, \"See this, a crime has been committed...\" the first thing I'm going to say is, \"Hang on, why are you spreading this everywhere instead of getting with the person and urging them to get help?\" \n\nGod, people can be so damned dumb sometimes and they just play into the hands of someone like Sarah who is both dumb and evil. \n\nThis is why rumors can be so damned dangerous and the crowd that simply screams \"Burn the Witch!\" like they're an extra in a Monty Python film are a giant part of the problem. \n\nGlad it turned out okay, but yes OP this is the time to clean house on anyone toxic who was part of this whole mess.",

It'd cost you $500 per letter to get me to send letters to each person that you think is illegally using your images. You can't afford this.\n\nAnd there is no such thing as \"pending copyright\". What? \n\nThis is some seriously awful bullshit.\n\nFor that matter, it's a Federal felony to make these copies if there are more than 10 of them (you said *hundreds*) and they are valued at more than $2500 (surely *hundreds* are worth that). Your lawyer, if they were real, would know this in about 5 seconds. \n\nBut just going back to state laws, you almost certainly live in a state where this would fall under the revenge porn statutes, and even if you didn't, it'd fall under cyberharassment or just plain harassment. (Of course, you aren't offering what state you're in because you're full of shit.) I can't imagine this couldn't be brought to court under sexual harassment charges.\n\nSexploitation? What? You just see that buzz word somewhere and decided to throw it in?\n\nWhy aren't the police confiscating *all of the phones*? You said that she *distributed* the images and videos. Why aren't all of these people being charged, or at the least investigated? \n\nAbsolutely nothing you've said about your interactions with the police seem remotely real.",

Saying you're making porn of a kink for money sounds a lot different than saying you're making porn because you have said kink. From my perspective it looks like the shame of having the kink was more than that of making porn so they went with the cover up.",

Copyright takes months to get registered and you can't bring suit in most places without it being registered, so this \"nuclear option\" will only become valid in a few months. None of this makes any sense, except as a fever dream fantasy. I register my hobby photos when I get to 750, just in case one of them happens to be better than I think, so it's something I'm kinda familiar with and this isn't how it works.",

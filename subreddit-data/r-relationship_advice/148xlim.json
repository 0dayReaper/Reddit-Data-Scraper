    "postText": "gf (22) says she is pregnant. we\u2019ve been together not long only 4 months and everything was smooth and happy. I was never given a positive test but she agreed to take another one with me, came up negative. So obv I know smthing is up, but idk why she feels she had to do this as everything was going well. She\u2019s adamant on her story being true of her having a positive test no matter how hard I push for the truth. I love her, and I know what I have to do and it hurts knowing I have to do it. I now question everything she tells me and it feels like it\u2019s all a lie. However, im scared of what she can pull when I dump her because of how comfortable she was pulling this. I feel like I\u2019m fucked either way and feel trapped. How do I approach this? What do I say to her? \n\nTLDR; gf lying about pregnancy",

            "comment": "3 weeks pregnant meaning you guys had sex a week ago? Pregnancy math is weird. The first 2 weeks are the weeks after your period (not technically pregnant) then weeks 3-5 are while you're waiting for a missed period. I honestly don't think it would show up on a blood test this early (not a doctor) \n\nKeep in mind, nothing shows up on an ultrasound until 6 weeks, (1-2 weeks after your missed period) and most doctors won't do a blood test to confirm until 6 weeks. \n\n I think she's lying, tests don't normally come back positive at 3 weeks pregnant, bc it's not really a thing. Plus unless it she planned getting pregnant, testing 1 week after ovulation is not normal. Because her period isn't technically missed, and she would have no symptoms to indicate she is pregnant\n\nShes lying to trap you, act carefully, pull out or don't have sex in the mean time. Ask to go to the doctors with her for her next appointment, who her ob is ect. Maybe ask to pull up her MyChart or online information because you want to know ther hcg level because you're so excited, have her show you her after visit summary. Do all this out of \"love\" keep an eye on the trash to see if she's hiding a period from you Once she's \"6-10weeks\" along and it's still sus, have her take a test in front you. If it's negative break up with her!",

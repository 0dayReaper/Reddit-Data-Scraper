    "postText": "I'm feeling a bit lost and confused in my relationship, and I could really use some advice. I've been dating my girlfriend for about a year now, and while we have some great moments together, there's something that's been bothering me: her use of the silent treatment.\n\nHere's the issue: Whenever I unintentionally do something wrong, like zoning out and not hearing what she said, or accidentally scaring her while watching a scary movie, she gets extremely mad and gives me the silent treatment. It's not just for a few minutes either; sometimes she won't talk to me for hours until she finally decides to break the silence. It's incredibly frustrating, and I'm not sure how to handle it.\n\nI've tried talking to her about this behavior, expressing how it makes me feel, but it often leads to arguments or her deflecting the issue. She claims that she needs time to cool down and process her emotions, but it feels like a disproportionate response to the situation at hand. I don't think it's healthy for our relationship to have these prolonged periods of silence every time something minor happens.\n\nI understand that communication is crucial in any relationship, and I genuinely want to work through this issue with her. But I'm not sure how to approach the subject without causing more tension. Has anyone else experienced a similar situation or have any advice on how to handle this silent treatment dynamic? How can I communicate my concerns effectively without turning it into a heated argument?\n\nI appreciate any insights or suggestions you may have. Thank you in advance!\n\nTL;DR: My girlfriend consistently uses the silent treatment whenever I do something wrong, even if it's unintentional. It's causing strain in our relationship, and I'm seeking advice on how to address this issue without further conflict.",

    "postText": "I (M19) work full time and sometimes experience delays in receiving my salary when the amount is more than the previous amount. When this happened recently, I informed them that they needed to wait a bit longer for the money to arrive. But this led to a heated argument where they said they can't burden themselves because of me and eventually told me to move out because it happens frequently (which is not true).\n\nThe topic of me moving out has been brought up repeatedly over the past few years. During arguments, they often tell me to 'move out' If I can't do X as a way to \\*silence or shut me up\\* (their own words). Finally, I decided to find a place of my own, packed my things, and will be moving out next week.\n\nAfter finding this out, they called for another discussion in which they indirectly tried to convince me not to move out. They mentioned how I was only with them for financial support and now that I can support myself financially, I'm leaving. Real and loyal relationships don't leave even after they are told to do so several times they said.\n\nThis happened before as well when I was 16, but at that time, I dropped the idea of moving out and stayed after a discussion. Today they brought up that I had previously considered staying because I realised there were benefits to living with family; leaving alone doesn't work. But now that I'm making more money than before, I'm leaving selfishly. They said I value money over relationships, which is not true. I am simply fed up with being told to move out in every single argument.\n\nNow they are angry and calling me stupid, ungrateful, and disrespectful for choosing to leave. Because of me, my mum may have a heart attack.\n\nSomething to add is that for the past few years, my salary has been going to their bank account and used to pay part of the rent and bills; now they will have to manage those expenses without my contribution.\n\nTLDLR; parents asked me to move out, and now that I'm leaving, they are angry with me and calling me selfish, stupid, ungrateful, and disrespectful.",

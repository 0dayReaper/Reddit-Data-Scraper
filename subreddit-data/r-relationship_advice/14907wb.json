    "postText": "So I (f18) have had the biggest crush on a guy (m18) for about a year now. For context, we both know of each other, but have probably said a total of 5 words to each other. Recently, I worked up the courage to add him by search on Snapchat, but it\u2019s been about a week and he has not accepted or rejected it. He doesn\u2019t have any social media besides that one and likely isn\u2019t active on it, so there\u2019s really nothing I can do to make a move. It is currently summer break, so unless we run into each other by chance, we won\u2019t see each other. We also don\u2019t really have any mutual friends, so I have no idea what to do.",

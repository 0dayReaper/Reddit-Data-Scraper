    "postText": "TLDR: My boyfriend (26M; ex now) cheated on me (26F) with his ex and got her pregnant. How do I move forward and heal?  \nI just need emotional support, tbh.  \nI want to go into alllll the details, but for my sanity and healing, I won\u2019t. Long story somewhat short, my ex and I were together for almost six months and throughout he made it clear that he has had bad relationships in the past and he struggled with commitment as he was afraid of getting hurt. We had a really great connection and great times together and I was very giving - arguably too giving, part of my personal struggle in relationships. He was the one who progressed our relationship to exclusively dating within the first couple of weeks. The issue we kept coming to was he was unwilling to budge in any way with integrating our lives (specifically, meeting each other\u2019s friends, he is best friends with my cousin so we would spend time with him, but I never met his friends and vice versa). We broke up at the beginning of May because it was clear it wasn\u2019t going to change on his end and I needed more. After we ended the officiality of our relationship (we didn\u2019t ven have pictures or post about each other, no one ever knew we were dating unless they talked ot us personally lol) kept seeing each other because it\u2019s hard to have a clean break, I would go over and stay with him, etc. Nothing really changed except that he got all he wanted without committing. Quite a few things felt off to me, I knew it wasn\u2019t in my best interest, but I didn\u2019t want to lose him. Things felt complicated because we grew up together (i hadn\u2019t seen him in 10 years when we reconnected and started dating), he\u2019s best friends my cousin, and we didn\u2019t want to ruin any positive relationship there could be.  \nNow. Here\u2019s the fucked up piece. This past weekend I decided I couldn\u2019t do this half-in/half-out with him anymore because we\u2019d have really great talks and have fun, then I wouldn\u2019t hear for him for a couple days and I was feeling really used. I sat him down to talk, told him how I felt, and something in me told me to ask him if he\u2019s slept with anyone else. I knew if i asked him directly he Wouldn\u2019t lie. Turns out, he went back to his very, very toxic and manipulative ex (who kept ties with his family after they had a bad ending) immediately after we \u201cbroke up\u201d and they had been seeing each other while I was still seeing him. THEN the next day we talk again and I find out that not only had he been seeing her the last few weeks, he cheated on me with her a few weeks before we broke up and now she\u2019s saying she\u2019s pregnant. To be honest, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s lying or if it isn\u2019t his, but that doesn\u2019t matter.  \nI\u2019m in shock, I feel horrified, betrayed, disgusted. To make matters worse, I had to go get STI testing today because I\u2019ve been having symptoms recently. And what I\u2019m struggling with: I care so deeply for him and he told me he loved me. He fucked up big time And is losing something VERY amazing for a very shitty road ahead of him. I\u2019m very empathetic and I\u2019m struggling to process what I\u2019m feeling, allowing myself to be angry, while also feeling sad for him and his life because he\u2019s the one who is losing. I\u2019ll be okay. I know my assets and my worth (for the most part, lol, work in progress).  \nAny advice, support, etc. is appreciated. I want to make it clear that we are never going to be in any type of relationship, that has affectively been ruined for fucking ever. This is my first really gut-wrenching heartbreak and betrayal like this. He was my first relationship after a traumatizing marriage and divorce and I really came to love him. I\u2019m embarassed, disgusted. I have been cheated on before and have had some pretty heavy trauma in my life, but he was the first man who made me actually believe he would never cheat on me so this is a huge blow. Everyone who knows him is shocked. And it\u2019s hard because I have cheated before (previous relationship) and done things I never knew I was capable of so I feel guilty for that as well.  \nRANT OVER. Thanks lol, xoxo",

Therapy isn't just for people with emotional problems but is also useful in getting people through rough times (like the ones you describe).",

Once he\u2019s out of your life fully you\u2019ll be able to more clearly see what a shitty man he is.\n\nYou won\u2019t be able to start to get over this if you\u2019re still letting him be in your life. The first step of healing is to remove the cause of your pain.",

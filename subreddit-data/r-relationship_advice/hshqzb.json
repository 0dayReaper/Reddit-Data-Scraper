    "postText": "Update to: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hqzpmb/my_boyfriend_isnt_okay_with_me_being_promiscuous/\n\nThank you for all the advice. I ended up bringing it up yesterday and it instantly turned into an argument again. He asked me why I\u2019m defending \u2018thots\u2019 so much yet again. Asking me why I cared so much about what he thought about woman who sleep around. He then went on to say I should of known better than to sleep with so much guys and that I \u2018knew what I was doing\u2019. He said I was straight up a thot in my past but he loves me and is willing to look past it. Yeah no. I stood my ground and said I can\u2019t be with anyone who sees woman like that and that I wasn\u2019t going to let him talk to me like that. I broke things off and he called me stupid for thinking he would let me break up with him and that turned into a whole new argument about how I ain\u2019t \u2018loyal\u2019 and I ain\u2019t no \u2018ride or die\u2019 chick. I also blocked him on all my socials and he is still making accounts to contact me on. Definitely made the right decision to end things. \n\nAlso to the people who messaged me saying he was right and that I deserved to be dumped. That nobody likes a used up chick, and many other unkind words, it was so unnecessary and I hope you step on a lego.\n\nEdit: Typos and Thank you for the rewards. \u2764\ufe0f",

He said something asinine like \"girls with lots of partners are, like, used goods cause a lot of dudes have hit that before.\"\n\nAfter restraining myself from knocking his teeth down his throat, I said, \"hmm. Let me ask you a question. Let's step back and look at this objectively. Say a girl you like has had twenty partners, but they were all one night stands.\"\n\nHe says, \"Damn, that's a ho, but okay.\"\n\nI raise a brow and he appropriately apologizes, so I continue, \"So that girl has only had sex 20 times ever.\"\n\nI see the wheels start to turn. \n\n\"Now, consider you decide to date a girl that's only had one partner before you. They dated for a year or so. Do you really think she only had sex with her ex 20 times in total, over a year? Do you think you're only gonna have sex with her twenty times over your relationship with her?\"\n\nOf course his response was hell no.\n\n\"So how is your girlfriend that you're banging as often as humanly possible somehow better than the chick that's only had sex 20 times?\"\n\nHe hadn't thought of it that way.\n\nI said, \"yeah, obviously... oh and if you ever say something that misogynistic to me again, I'll... *fill in what you think I probably said yourselves, lol*\"",

Why he thought it was that a dude with lots of partners is a stud, but the same doesn't hold true for girls.\n\nHe said after we had talked, he really got to thinking about it and he didn't have a good reason, beyond cultural and/or religious stuff. I asked if the situation were reversed, how would he feel if his worth as a human being was looked at as less because he's had more than one partner.\n\nHe didn't think he'd like it much.\n\nLook, my kid isn't perfect. No one's kid is. I've worked hard, put time and effort and learning into being a good parent. I know he's gonna have his own thoughts and opinions and we won't always see eye to eye. That doesn't mean we shouldn't be able to talk about things and try to change the other person's mind when we really think they are wrong.\n\nI listen when he speaks. He does likewise. I didn't actually attack him; I posited a theoretical situation and asked him to look at things from an outside perspective. And he did. The fact that his mind about women having multiple partners may have been changed is great because I don't tolerate many isms. \n\nThat wasn't the only goal, though, you know? The point was we could actually have that talk, openly and freely, and know we still love each other and respect each other when it was done.",

I just thought I'd throw in some input to explain what might be happening for the benefit of other young asshole dudes who might identify with Mr. Ruff Ryder here.\n\nI have a hard time as seeing every knuckledragging manboy on here as some master manipulator.  I also find it weird that so much attention is paid teaching women to identify these signs when we also need to teach men to identify their own toxic behavior. 99% of young men are not emotional geniuses who can intentionally do shit to manipulate anyone. Its definitely subconscious, meaning young men need to be taught mindfulness to identify when they're accidentally being a scumbag, and then stop. I was once a scumbag and sincerely had no idea.  I'm reformed now. Now the only manipulating I do is around not unloading the dishwasher. But to be fair I load that motherfucker like nobody's business. \n\nI used to be the type of guy that got bothered by body counts when I was in my early 20s and I'm can tell you definitively that I was definitely the asshole and at fault for it, but I wasn't playing 4D chess or trying to manipulate anyone.  I felt inadequate that I was \"beaten\" by my girlfriend in numbers and that inadequacy made me want some kind of assurance that she would stay. I think in redditspeak we would call my tactic \"lovebombing\", though I certainly was not capable of tactical thought. I believe my response to why the body count bothered me was a hastily made up explanation that \"oh you told me it was x but bloweys count so you're a liar\". It made no sense, even at the time, but I was too lizard brained to process it. \n\nI was just insecure as fuck but couldn't share it because I was insecure as fuck.  I was a stupid young man who hadn't gained all of his executive function to regulate new and confusing emotions.  Men tend to complete physical development of the prefrontal cortex between 24 and 27 whereas women are between 21 and 25.  This part of your brain allows you to process emotions and not just \"feel\". It's why children melt down and can't rationalize actions. This is not an excuse, this is an explanation for why there are so many issues with men in the 21 through 26 age group who have been told they are adults, but have the emotional regulation of middle schoolers which results in being very confident that their feelings aren't straight garbage.  It's also a weird time because you're dealing with women who are CLEARLY levels above you developmentally, which also fucks with insecurities.\n\nI was an asshole.  This guy is an asshole.  I think we need to do a better job somehow making men this age realize they are prone to being the asshole. Personally, I think most of us grow out of it, usually when we chase off a couple awesome partners. \n\nAt 23 I went through a breakup and basically took two years off, and at 25 I had a partner who playfully self-identitied as a \"ho bag\" whenever she was single and I suddenly had the introspection to be terrified that it would bother me. But it didn't. I never asked because I didn't care, as opposed to not asking because I couldn't bear knowing. \n\nThis is rambly as shit but I guess the point is for guys under 25, beware your own brain and if you struggle to explain your feelings, it's because they are irrational and wrong a solid 95% of the time.  Just because science explains why you're an asshole doesn't give you an excuse to be an asshole either. \n\nOP did the right thing. Not only for herself but for him since he clearly isn't ready for a relationship and was always going to have a bad time. Try again when you're 25, kid.",

What a warning does though is provide additional gravity for when the harassment is reported after the warning is ignored, in that it demonstrates that the OP's ex is in a state of mind where the threat of legal action and police involvement is of no concern to them, and hence they're a significantly greater threat to the OP than could be suggested otherwise. Given the way that harassment complaints are often handled very poorly by police departments it's important to frame the complaint in a way that seeks as serious a response as possible. Showing that the subject of the complaint disregards the authority and \"power\" of the police is one such way to do that.",

The issue with immediately going to the police at that point is the complaint becomes one of \"I broke up with my ex and blocked them online and they made a new account to contact me\", which is less likely to be taken seriously and risks being judged as an overreaction. That perception of the OP then risks coloring the rest of the police's response once the ex starts escalating further.\n\nIn an ideal world it'd absolutely be the best course of action to file a complaint at the earliest possible stage, but police incompetence and prejudice means it's not necessarily the best thing to do.",

I don't know any decent men who'd want to be in a relationship with a woman who's done 20 guys before she's even 21. Points to a serious lack of character and probably let's be honest mental issues. Sure if you're hot, you'll get some dregs of society to fuck you. You're not gonna get a descent dude to stick around though.\n\nI'm sorry if that too hard to accept that you have to lie to yourself. There's a lot of people out there who will give you an out so you don't have to think about this truth. It's the path for weaker people, weaker minds. Instead recognize that your behavior was degenerate, deep down you know it's true. What you've done is a clear sign of desperation for attention, but it's shallow attention.\n\nGrow the fuck up, become someone of worth and start living as a good person. Become a person you can be proud of.\n\n**To pass on some wisdom to younger dudes here:**\n\n**Never stay with a chick unless she brings something to the table besides her holes. You will always have a bad end if you don't do this. I've let my dick think for me enough, finally learned that lesson after a ton of bad, crazy shit. Make sure she's the kind of person you'd want to chill with even if you weren't fucking. If not you're better off alone until you do find the cool chick. If you just fuck and date crazy thots and hoes, it could ruin you for the quality one you really want.**",

His reaction to the information is out of the existential fear of the possibility of being made to take care of children that are not his own, and given your past sexual conduct, his instinct is telling him to back off.   \nYou will have this issue with every man you encounter that has a little self-esteem. \n\nAnd you are only 21 and have been with almost 20 guys? if you have been having sex for 3 years then you have slept with a different dude every 2-3 months, and I bet more than once with each of them.  At this rate when you are 30 if you remain single you would have had tasted more d1ck than Pamela Anderson and probably have a couple of STDs. No good man will ever want to touch you. \n\nI think you need to see a therapist that helps you figure out why you treat yourself in such a cheap way.",

            "comment": "Do the number of past sex partners matter at some point? My experience is it does, principally because it relates to how special sex is with your partner. Sex can be a great source for creating an emotional bond ... or it can just be like two dogs going at it in the street. \n\nPlus having many past sex partners gets to be a habit. Getting married doesn\u2019t change that habit. \n\nI married a woman who by age 21 had had some 100 past sex partners. Sure, we were in love. I think she even took her wedding vows seriously. \n\nBut to her sex wasn\u2019t just about love. She also enjoyed what I call \u201csport fucking\u201d. In other words, she enjoyed just having sex for sex\u2019s sake and with a variety of people. When you\u2019re married and deceiving your spouse to get that \u201cjust sex, new sex\u201d thrill that\u2019s not good.\n\nThe end result was she cheated. She had secret affairs, including one night stands. We got divorced. One of her parting comments was I that it was all my fault because I should have known she would do this given her history.\n\nSo am I being politically incorrect? Perhaps. But I\u2019m being a realist. And the reality is the N count DOES matter at some point.",

    "postText": "\nTLDR; my bf and i had a sleepover and i woke up to him kissing my feet. we have never talked about foot stuff, but i dont even know if he was doing it sexually or just because. i didnt confront him, how do i ask him why he did that? \n\n\nme (20f) and my boyfriend(20m)have been dating for a few months. hes a really wonderful boyfriend, we are both falling for eachother. we\u2019ve slept together several times. i just got back from a family trip and we really missed eachother. we had a sleepover and at some point i woke up to him touching and kissing my feet. there have been like 2 times where i\u2019ve noticed that we fell asleep the same way, but then wake up and hes flipped to have his head by my feet at the end of the bed. the other times i never thought anything of it or asked why he was sleeping that way. but now im like wait lol was he doing that each time? \ni woke up to him gently touching and a few times kissing one foot, then he like put it on his face/side of his neck kinda i think?idk i couldnt tell. and then he touched my other foot but he hesitated a while, and then he pulled it to be by his face. he was being gentle and giving light kisses and in a way i thought was sweet but it also gave me a weird feeling in my gut. because like was he doing this for sexual purposes or just to be affectionate? i dont think he was getting off on it but also idk what if im just telling myself that. he knows im super ticklish and i don\u2019t really like him touching my feet. i finally pretended to wake up because he turned on his phone and i saw the light from it and i jumped bc i thought he took a picture of me or something, but he apologized and said he didnt. i asked and he showed me his camera roll/snapchats. i didnt want to bring up the foot thing because he\u2019d def be embarrassed and i didnt know exactly what to say or how to ask. So reddit, now i ask you all, wth do i do?!?! and what was that about? but mainly, what do i do and how do i ask him about it? i don\u2019t wanna break up with him or anything but. that was. djhfehhrheji don\u2019t understand. Whyd he do that. i feel like if i ask him about it he\u2019ll be embarrassed or what if he lies? if he lies about it im gon dump him because i know it happened lol. ughhh idk. i don\u2019t feel violated but i will say im kinda weirded out.",

            "comment": "So my bf randomly flips in his sleep and ends up at the foot of the bed all the time. I usually tell him about it in the morning, but he rarely has any recollection of it. When he does remember he did it, he usually says it's because it was hot and he was restless. So the flipping thing itself doesn't seem weird to me. \n\nDoes he usually kiss you and hug you when he's waking up? Like does he hold your face and upper body like that or is this something that happens only with your feet? Is he also only doing it while he thinks you're asleep, or does he continue to do it when he notices you're awake as well? \n It could be just affection for you, and he's just showing it to whatever body part is nearest because he sees you as a whole or it's actually a foot fetish. \n\nThe fact that you feel uncomfortable with it, though, should be reason to address it. Tell him nicely that you noticed it a few times and you're not fond of it because your feet are ticklish and it makes you uncomfy. And you need to especially tell him that whilst you're asleep and don't know what's going on, it makes you feel extra uncomfortable when he does certain things. It's okay to tell him your boundaries and what you're comfortable with vs. not comfortable with. He should understand. If he doesn't, well you know what to do.",

If he were to kiss your feet or suck on a toe for foreplay, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily mean that he looks at feet on the web and gets excited. He may be exploring your body and enjoying all parts, and in a sexual way. At 20, I think that is healthy and exciting. \n\nIf you are uncomfortable with anything, you should say something. If you are not sure if you are uncomfortable you can say that. If you don\u2019t want him touching you when you are sleeping tell him. Or give him boundaries. He can only touch you above the waist and no kissing. Or whatever boundary you have. If you don\u2019t know what boundaries you want, talk to him about it and figure it out. \n\nIf you want to know what he thinks of your feet, ask him if he likes your feet. Ask him if he likes your feet more than your neck. If you painted your toe nails ask him if your toes are sexy. Just bring up the subject and talk about it and you should be able to figure out where he is at on the fetish scale.",

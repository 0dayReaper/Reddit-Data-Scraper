    "postText": "I initially had these doubts because a lot of the times we hang out, we end up doing things she enjoys even if I don\u2019t enjoy them and almost ever do anything I like to do.\n\nThe doubts got stronger recently when I asked her advice on planning a trip because she recently went on a girls trip with her friends. Her response was to go with people you can easily manipulate to do what you want. \n\nLately I have been getting the feeling that she is trying to manipulate me into marrying her. I generally feel like we won\u2019t be a good fit in the long term, but sometimes after having conversations with her about it, I suddenly feel like I should marry her and that feeling only lasts for a couple of days. \n\nMy social skills are pretty rough so I am also not sure if I am misreading the situation. How do I know for sure if she is manipulating me?",

    "postText": "I am 25(F). I am in relationship with someone 25(m) who is from different country and culture. We have been living together for almost 3 years. I don't know why i am having strange feelings. Does it happen to everyone?? Im just scared if something happen to our relationship. I mean what if he change his mind and want to break up. We never talk about our future. He supports me in every things motivate me, he is kind of good person but never really express his own feelings.I feel like we are going with the flow. I don't know what should i do or really talk about? My only wish is to marry him and live happily. I really appreciate if someone could give me some suggestions",

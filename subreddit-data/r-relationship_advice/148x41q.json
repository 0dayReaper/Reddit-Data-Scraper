    "postText": "My friend and I have been friends for about 6 years. After college we went our separate ways but still kept in touch through occasional texts / calls. We recently met in person after about 2 years and I was introduced to her new boyfriend. At that time they had been dating for \\~2 months.\r  \n\r  \nI don't want to get into too much detail but the dude was still married and trying to go through a divorce when they started dating. The dude also has 2 young kids. I have only met the dude once. I don't really know how to explain the vibe I got from him. He just seems like the type of alpha male guy who will never admit they made a mistake or apologize for anything (if that makes sense). Kinda like a narcissist? Even when I got all these bad vibes from him, I saw she was happy and kept my mouth shut.\r  \n\r  \nFast forward to \\~a week after the introduction and my friend calls me to tell me she's pregnant with his child (keep in mind they've only been dating for \\~2 months at this point). I asked her in a joking kinda way \"are we happy about this\" and her reply was a few awkward laughs and a \"uuuh yeah I think so!\". Again she seemed happy so I said \"congratulations\" even though deep down I was worried for her. When I asked her what her boyfriend said, she said he seemed surprised and said something along the lines of \"that was fast!\" and something like \"you know, babies mostly want their mom right?\". The dude is not interested in meeting my friend's family (to be honest the family doesn't really want to meet him either) and when they hold the baby shower, he doesn't want to be there.\r  \n\r  \nAt this point I'm freaking out about my friend and worried about this unborn child. Again I dont want to go into too much detail but my friend doesn't really have the most stable life right now (mentally and financially), neither does the dude. It seems like he doesn't really care about my friend's baby, heck I feel like he doesn't really care about his other kids either because instead of worrying about them during his divorce he was out looking for people to date before the divorce even happened.\r  \n\r  \nAm I overreacting about this dude when I've only met him once? Should I have said something to my friend when I met her boyfriend for the first time? Should I have told her to really consider having an abortion because at this point in her life having a baby might be too much of a burden on her?? \n\nWhat do I do moving forward? Continue to pretend I like the asshole and support my friend? I dont want to stress her out because it seems like no once else in her life is supportive of her decisions (both with meeting this dude and getting pregnant).\n\nTLDR: My friend is pregnant after being with her 2 month boyfriend and he seemed like a toxic man when I met him. Should I continue to pretend I approve of him and support my friend or tell her how I actually feel about him?",

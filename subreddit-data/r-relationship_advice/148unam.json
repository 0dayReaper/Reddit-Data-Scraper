    "postText": "I, 20 F, have just recently started dating my bf, 24 M, after a while of serious talking. My bf has a friend that he\u2019s known since last year. They had a one night stand last summer, and still are friends after that. Once he started dating me he was very transparent about this situation. Before we started getting serious he\u2019s made it extremely clear to her that he does not see her romantically and doesn\u2019t want to be with her. He\u2019s even told me that when he\u2019s dating someone he only has his eyes on that person.  They all share a friend group and don\u2019t hang out one on one. This friend group wants to visit DC this summer and for some reason I feel so ugh about it. I know he\u2019s made the boundary with her, but the fact that they had sex before. He obviously has chosen me for various reasons but there is always that insecure feeling in the back of my mind. Advice? I also have anxious attachment style if that helps \ud83d\ude05",

It\u2019s no use having the same fights over and over again so the sooner you make that clear the better for you both.",

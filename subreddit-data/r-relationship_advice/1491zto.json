    "postText": "I (21M) am going to go to my university which is out of state for 5 months until i return again. My Girlfriend (18F) and I have gotten so close together in the last 4 months we been together. Sneaking out together, sleeping together for nights, Spending time together on beautiful dates. I love her so much. And i know it's true. I feel she feels the same. \nSo before I go, i want to give her something that will make her remember me. Like a sorta DIY thing that will be with her to remind her of my presence. I saw a reel on Instagram where a lady prepared a Lips Kiss shirt where she applied her lipstick on her lips and kisses the shirt multiple times. \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/reel/CtYBRZ-raNK/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\n\nIf there are any suggestions, please help out. Thanks.",

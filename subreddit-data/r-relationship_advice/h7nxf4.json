    "postText": "Last night I had a really bad migraine and my husband was at work. I asked my son(16m) if he could give his sister(2f) a bath since my head was killing me.\n\nHe was perfectly fine with this and when my husband got home he found me asleep. He woke me up asking if I had made dinner or given our daughter a bath yet. I told him that I had a migraine so our son gave her a bath. He screamed at me saying that this was not ok for him to do unsupervised.\n\nHe said that my migraine was no excuse to not take care of her. Then my son hears him yelling at me and tries to get him to stop. He hasn\u2019t spoken to either of us since, what should I do\n\nEdit my son is not related to my husband",

It could be anywhere from him worrying the 16 y/o could be irresponsible and the 2 y/o getting hurt due to it, or he could think your son is a creep. I can't say which is more likely, but from him screaming like that and getting very upset it sounds like he thinks the 2 y/o is in danger somehow by being alone with your son. \n\nEither way its no excuse to scream like that. You were hurting and your son helped you out in taking care of the baby, which is a great thing. And obviously you trusted your son enough to give that responsibility to him. \n\nI'd see if you can figure out why he became so upset and go on from there, since his reasoning can mean a lot. If he just says \"Im worried a 16 year old can be dumb and drop a baby\" then perhaps thats something that can be discussed along with his temper and how he treats you. But if he says \"I think our son could be a pedo\" then, of course, that's much more extreme. \n\nEither way, only do what you believe is safe for you and your kids. He sounds like he has a short temper and yells at you a lot. For this relationship to be healthy and thrive, that has to change. \n\nBut if you believe confrontation could be putting you or your kids in danger, I highly suggest finding a safe plan to leave or to keep in contact with someone who could help.",

He yelled at me once when I was in high school for buying two female friends a small Christmas gift. Went on about how inappropriate it was. The gifts were a pack of colored pens and a basketball. Found out years later that he cheated on my mom while she was pregnant.",

I do believe everyone should take signs of sexually jokes, actions, or anything around children extremely seriously and treat it as a warning. No one in their right mind makes sexual jokes around or about kids unless they think that shit deep down.",

Does he ever insult you, or generally make you feel bad about yourself? I hope it is not a common occurrence for him to give you the silent treatment as punishment.\n\nEdit: I just saw this other response you gave to a question asking what else he has yelled at you for. \n\n&gt;Not cleaning the house right after I had my daughter, buying myself clothes without asking him, and getting my haircut without telling him\n\nOP, you don't have to identify his behavior as such, but this is abusive behavior. It is not okay for him to control your finances, appearance, or actions. Abuse revolves around power and control, and the [Power and Control Wheel](https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/2019-08/Gender%20Neutral%20Power%20Control%20Wheel.pdf) is a helpful tool to illustrate this.\n\nIf you ever want help, please consider using this [document of abuse resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14I3lGpEQa-pLl9Lz0JW1PoNyyOwg6WOom_oK2NMBxy8/edit). It contains safety plans, online support groups, hotlines, and more.\n\nIn addition, if you ever want to seek support and advice from other women who have experienced similar abusive behaviors in their relationship, there is [a list of online domestic abuse support groups here](https://www.myawayout.org/peer-online-support).\n\nA safety plan would be a good idea to put together at the absolute least. [A safety plan](https://www.thehotline.org/help/path-to-safety/) is a personalized, practical plan that includes ways to remain safe while in a relationship, planning to leave, or after you leave. There are examples of safety plans for both adults and children at the link above. If you think it would be helpful to document the abuse (I believe it would be given that abuse often escalates), [DocuSAFE is a free app that helps survivors collect, store, and share evidence of abuse](https://www.techsafety.org/docusafe), such as domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, online harassment, and dating violence.",

This is because I was working through things in my head, and because I wanted to make sure I understood why I was frustrated rather than reacting in the moment.\n\nThe purpose of being quiet was to keep myself from doing anything upsetting, but it was also partly to communicate that I was upset.  I would always in the end talk through it with my wife once I understood it myself.\n\nNow this is very different from using stonewalling as an abuse tactic.  Stonewalling to be abusive would be like intentionally ignoring you in order to make you feel bad about yourself. To make you feel isolated and demeaned. \n\nPeople get upset, and people communicate their feelings differently.  Being quiet to communicate your feelings of anger isn't abusive, it's not always particularly effective on it's own.  But being quiet, reflecting and then talking after is probably MORE respectful than if the alternative is reacting angrily and saying hurtful things, then reflecting, and then talking about it after. \n\nThe question is really intent.  Is he going quiet to try to hurt you? Or is he going quiet because he's feeling hurt and is trying to communicate that and understand it himself.  \n\nAlso, I'll give a piece of advice.  If it is the latter, don't try to apologize, at least not to make things better.  If he IS trying to puzzle it out, work with him on that instead.  Rather than saying \"I'm sorry\" and getting frustrated if he doesn't perk back up again, think about what might be going through his head.  There's a good chance he's feeling embarrassed that he even felt upset over that little thing in the first place, that's why he restrained himself from an outburst.  \n\nInstead try something like saying \"Hey, I think you might have felt bad after I did --blah--, is that right?\" pause, \"I was feeling --this way-- when I did that.  I didn't consider that it might hurt you, do you want me to try to avoid that in the future?\" if he says yes, then apologize and try and avoid doing it now that you know it hurts him.  If he says no, then ask something like \"Why do you think that bothered you today?\"  and then go from there.\n\nLots of times people can feel ashamed of even being upset by things they think they shouldn't be upset about. If you go into it apologizing, that can just be frustrating because it brings to the forefront the idea that they're not even able to handle a little joke or something.  \n\nIf instead, you go into it trying to understand how he's feeling, and explain what you were feeling, maybe the both of you can get to a better understanding of what actually bothered him, and you guys will feel more like a team trying to solve the mystery rather than have him feel like he's failing to properly perform for you. \n\nGuys are trained young to hide their feelings. It doesn't mean they want to, but if they don't feel safe, they will avoid it.  Coming at it from a non-threatening, low pressure angle might be something that can be welcomed. \n\nAlso, don't think you're an idiot. Feelings are hard. It could be he's having trouble too, but you've identified it, it jut needs to be approached lovingly.\n\nNow that all only really applies if he's not trying to hurt you.  If the goal of his silence is to try to punish or hurt you, then it's different, and you need to address by letting him know how he's making you feel, and keep yourself safe especially if he knows it hurts you and he continues to do it because it does.",

He would bitch and scream at me because the house wasn\u2019t his level of clean.. that my cooking was never cooking because all I did was put stuff in pans and omg *cook it*. He even used to Criticise day the way I ate, screamed at me over Xbox, punch walls, throw things, break stuff like controllers etc. all he did when he was home from work was sit on his phone or have his mates over smoking pot outside until all hours of the morning. If we ever got into arguments while he was driving he would always say he was going to kill all us, drive really erratically or just stop in the middle of the highway and try to get out and walk in front of another car. \n\nHe wanted to pay all the bills because he made $900 a week. Where as I was a sahm to which I got around $500 a fortnight from the gov which paid for my car, fuel because I had to drive him to and from work as he didn\u2019t have a licence, my phone, the internet bill, water and I used to buy all the boys clothes and toys. He started making me give him half of what I got paid to go towards rent so he could waste more money on drugs for him and his friends. He never paid bills on time which they were all in my name, he flat out refused to put more money away into utilities each week because he didn\u2019t think he needed to. It was all fun and games until we got slugged repeatedly with a $900 gas bill. Everything where he lives is gas... gas stove, gas heaters etc and it\u2019s always cold so I had to have the heater going for the boys. Then when we broke up he would tell me it was all my fault, I forced all the bills into him and that if I ever need money I need to \u201cget off my fat ass and get a job\u201d. My sons are 3, it costs $100 per child per day to put them into care. I can\u2019t afford to return to work even if I wanted to. \n\nI was with him for 4 years. He ended the relationship when my twin sons were 18 months old (yea I was raising twins alone despite living with him. Doing everything in the house and yard including driving him to and from work 2 weeks post c section), moved back home. I was a shell of the person I used to be before I met him. Its taken 2 years and I\u2019m still not 100%. He doesn\u2019t even bother with my sons. Hasn\u2019t seen them in those 2 years, doesn\u2019t ask how they\u2019re doing. Nothing. Only pays the bare minimum of child support ordered by the state. Even now I get around $1300 a fortnight from the gov for being a stay at home parent, I pay ALL my bills and the same amount of rent on a couple of hundred less than he earned every week. So I don\u2019t understand why it was such a difficult task. \n\nYour mental health being in a relationship like this isn\u2019t going to get better. It\u2019s going to get worse.",

It really says a lot about a parents character and it\u2019s really concerning that they would even let someone they thought would be \u201ctempted\u201d by their child anywhere near them.\nMy mind immediately jumped to this because I remember a case (very vaguely) where a girl was being molested by her father and he would get really jealous if any man came near because he wanted her for himself if I remember correctly. It\u2019s actually surprisingly common how often people will be terrified someone will do something heinous just because they themselves would do it. I definitely get uneasy vibes from this guy.\nI hope you\u2019ve been able to heal from that experience, and that you\u2019re doing well now.",

It\u2019s his own sister, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s watched her before. This is definitely coming from some issue the dad has but it\u2019s really hard to say what that would be because this whole situation seems so odd. I\u2019m sure his son is incredibly hurt his father would think he would do something like that (assuming the children are full-siblings). It could be that he\u2019s  the son\u2019s step dad and that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t fully trust him, but whatever the relationship is, i think it\u2019s a giant leap to accuse him of even thinking about doing something inappropriate unless he had a really solid reason to believe he would, but I feel like he would\u2019ve said something about it instead of just shutting down. I think there are definitely certain implications the father was making, I just don\u2019t know what would make him so upset and worried.\nAlso wow! You are a super parent, I couldn\u2019t even take care of myself when I was 16 lol. I have a lot of respect for teenage parents, it\u2019s really hard and scary putting your whole life on hold to take care of a child while you\u2019re still basically a child yourself.",

I\n\nNot to be mean, but based on information OP's provided in other replies, that is definitely *not* what is going on here.  He imagines it's inappropriate for a boy to bathe a girl, he's looking for a reason to chastise OP, he is controlling and abusive, and he likes to yell at her when she takes care of her own needs (such as resting when she has a migraine, cutting her hair without his permission, not cleaning well enough after she came home from birth with a newborn).  *That's* what's going on here.  \n\nHaving a conversation explaining the dynamics between siblings and the obvious ability of a 16 year old to care for a 2 year old is not going to solve the problem.",

While it raises mine and a few other eyebrows to read you take care of the baby while he works late every night, that\u2019s your arrangement and not ours!

            "comment": "Ok.. so, my father didn\u2019t allow me to be around my brothers. Since I can remember.. I had to be in my room. Couldn\u2019t watch movies in my own living room if my brothers and cousins were over. My brothers lived in the basement level, and my bedroom was upstairs next to there room. It was a rule kinda thing, my room had to be by my parents because I\u2019m a girl. Just taking care of there only daughter right?. My grandma was staying with us for some time and so my cousins would come over weekends and they would rent movies and watch them in the living room. Or all of them go together to the movies.. I wasn\u2019t allowed to go. I\u2019m a girl. I could get pregnant. I was maybe 12 when things got very bad at home.. I would cry a lot because I couldn\u2019t go anywhere, I\u2019d ask my mom for permission To go with them to watch movies and she\u2019d get into big fights because of me. She\u2019d say yes, he\u2019d say No. then they would fight. He once got so mad I went to the store with my big brother, we went to buy a printer.. I got home and they were yelling at each other and then my mom turned to me and yelled at me for leaving with my brother.. I think it became easier for her to go with his rules. I thought she would defend me, I would just get grounded over anything and everything. I thought my dad hated me. I thought maybe if I were born a man .. I would think maybe he thinks I\u2019m not his. I would think so manny things. Trying to make sense. Why must I be locked up.. why is being a girl so bad. Why can\u2019t I just stay in the living room with everyone else and watch the movie.. \n\nAt the same time all these things are happening.. \nI would come home from school. I think I was in 6th grade when it started. On my bed, in a mini DVD player almost every other day.. was a porn video just there on my bed. No explanation just there. Ready for me to press play. \n\nI pressed play. And not only did I watch that video and all the rest that followed. I also didn\u2019t know what to do with them after.. so I would hide them.. in my underwear drawer. I assumed they were my brothers porn videos, and figured they\u2019 were looking for privacy and used my room since they shared the basement room.  Idk that made the most logical sense to me, I didn\u2019t want my brothers to know I was watching porn! So I hid it in my super top secret place that no one dare look. My top dresser underwear drawer. -_- \n\nAnd no one ever asked me like, hey sis sorry I left something here like don\u2019t watch it.. or nothing as if, \nNo one owned the DVDs. I ended up collecting a good stash of porn.. and now that I\u2019m really thinking about it. Wow they were a lot, I was in 6th grade and ended up having a pretty big porn stash.  I thought my brothers must be leaving the room in such a hurry there leaving there porn behind and won\u2019t dare ask me, for the same reason I don\u2019t tell them. Embarrassing. \n\nThere are a lot of things, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to remember. But one of my suppressed memories, that came to me during some therapy, for sex addiction btw,  was of my father. In my room. Watching me. \nAnd that made me remember way way way back.. when I was very small. I have always remembered This next thing. But didn\u2019t  think anything of it when I was small.. \n\nI was in my room, and I was changing, and watching tv at the same time. Moving around my room just doing this and that. All in my underwear. Then I saw his eyes. And I kinda froze. And I said something like papa what are you doin. You scared me. And he got out of my closet and laughed. Said he was gona scare me. And I kinda was confued a bit like what a weird way.. but I mean it made sense and he left fast. And I was there like ok. That was random. \n\nFast forward, not to long ago my auntie, His little sister. We were drinking at a bar and one topic led to another. She shared with me that when she was small. He raped her and my other auntie. I\u2019m not sure how old they were but they didn\u2019t know what was really happening. . \nI almost fell.. it\u2019s like.. wow. That explains it all... \nI cried and cried and cried... \n\nYeah I don\u2019t talk to my dad.. our relationship was always wrong. He always sexualized me. My mom did nothing to help. I remember my mother telling me I had to be firm and tell MY DAD. That i, his 10-13 year old daughter, wasn\u2019t HIS. Like.. yeah like his his.  In the nasty way. \n\nI struggle with relationships with men.. keeping everyone away. Or somehow falling for cold, controlling, abusive relationships. \n\n.please don\u2019t be my mom. \n\nThe only people I can be close to is my brothers, they were there for everything that I went thru. My only rocks in my life. My big brother was more of a father than my real one. And he wasn\u2019t his son. He dressed and fed me. He also helped me escape some like 2 times back in the day. He took me to the movies.. with the rest of the family..\n\nEdit::: FIRST GOLD AND A HUG! Thank you!",

Abusers are sick (braindamage) and/or have been victims themselves. Normal people wouldn't even think the thought. Statistics say there is a much larger risk for your husband to abuse your son, that for your son to abuse his sister. Interaction as siblings decrease the risk, even if siblings have no shared DNA. It's healthy family bonding that makes siblings feel like siblings, not DNA. With no sibling bond, risk of abuse is higher.\n\nI don't know your boy or you husband, but you have cause for concern - more for the husband though. Get him therapy, or couples therapy. Involve the boy only if nessasary. If he doesn't already know your husbands fears - try to keep it from him. It will ruin any chance of trust.",

But honestly when reading stuff like this most guys get a little blip on their radar that this dude (your husband) is trouble, and if he finds an issue with someone cleaning a baby, it means he is harboring some intense repressed sexual shit and projecting it onto others. Like he is concerned your son touched your daughter inappropriately? The only people that default to that assumption are ones that don't trust themselves to not do the same, i.e. the types of people that would touch your daughter....",

You both die tomorrow, you son is left to raise your daughter, how does he take care of her then or would he rather they go in care?\n\nThis is a major over reaction and i honestly dont see his thinking in this. If it wasnt a sibling then maybe but come on its his sister.\n\nYou need to sit him down and ask him to explain why he did what he did. If he carries on being a. A hole id be considering the future as you have said this isnt the first time he behaved like this",

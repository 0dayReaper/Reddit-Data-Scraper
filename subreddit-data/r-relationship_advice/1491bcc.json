    "postText": "My bf and I have been together for 1.5 years and met his friend last year. The other day his friend called me and it ended up being a 4 hour conversation about deep stuff.\n\nMg bf has been really busy lately and when his friend calls me he says \u201cCant wait till X is more available so we can all hang again.\u201d I feel like his friend is a good friend since he takes a sincere interest in listening to me, but sometimes I feel like he\u2019s trying to make an impression? For example, telling me things about himself that are different from my BF but are good qualities of his. \n\nI dont know what to do. I really enjoy talking to his friend and he helps me out a lot and complements my ideas when we share our thoughts to each other . Recently he\u2019s been talking to me More than he talks to my BF but that could be because my BF has been busy. \n\nTL;DR:\nMy (25F) BF\u2019s (25M) friend (27M) of 10 years has been talking to me a lot and sharing personal lives to each other. I don\u2019t want to break my BF\u2019s trust. How can I tell if the dude\u2019s just being friendly with me because I\u2019m his buddy\u2019s gf and not because he may like me?",

New relations are always more exciting because u haven't seen the negatives of a person, its really up to you but mate guarding and jealousy are a very popular thing because of mate poaching.",

I bet you would feel really bad\n\nOh and you need to talk to your boyfriend to reevaluate the relationship, if you are falling in love with his \"friend\" it's because you are losing feelings for your boyfriend and you need to talk it out.\n \nSorry if I'm being too blunt but I feel like you're not seeing reality and you're blinding yourself. \n\nI hope you make the right decisions :)",

Just a warning, your brain chemicals change in infidelity, so you might be all high from the feelings (aka making posts like this one), but you're gonna come down and there will be consequences.",

    "postText": "Random age put for \"dating app folks\" since the moderator bot needed an age for that.\n\nI have come to realize throughout my dating life that I don't actually want to live with my future spouse. I own two houses right next to each other. Ideally we would both have our own house and I already have the main hurdle to this set up. I just have realized how much I loathed picking up after another person, and I never will have children so that situation doesn't apply here. I have lived with two partners before for multiple years at a time, and broke up due to moves not due to living together based conflicts. Neither were particularly messy, but additional perks of living alone is that I can decorate the whole house in my style (no soccer jerseys in the LR), stay up however long I wish without worrying of disturbing them (sew at 2AM), etc. If I were to live with someone I would at a minimum need my own bedroom and office  - and two 2BD houses are way cheaper than a solid single family sized house in my area.   \nI have had great success in the dating arena even though I prefer non-traditional relationships (ENM, with a main partner). So, I think that the individuals that are already \"liking\" my profile are more open minded with non-traditional relationship structures. Also, depending on the ENM structure they prefer this set up is just better anyways. I just am unsure if there is a less offensive way to tell folks I don't want to live with them. Sleepovers, sure! Dinner every night at either house, sure! I just want my own space.  \nIntersex and non-binary, but I am not sure what genders the form accepts so I put my AGAB. Also, I am not some rich person with two nice houses. They are solid starter homes in an affordable city that I was able to buy with my doctoral student salary. This setup would not be realistic if the person had 500k house tastes.",

I think a lot of folks don't realize this unless they are in that scene, and most of the folks I date have also \"sought after\" professions or are exemplary members of the community. It really is easy to date within that scene, especially if pan and AFAB. \n\nI don't really see being with each other for the 4-6 hours after work and then going to our houses 20 feet away from each other to be particularly extreme, because what else is being accomplished relationship wise while asleep?\n\nI wouldn't consider my decision to be based off of poor communication at all, it was a result of good communication requiring compromises so both parties felt \"at home\" as much as possible. I just don't want to compromise within my own space, so I went and bought another house that I will rent until I find someone amendable to the situation and date them for a year or so before they move next door. Me having this boundary is the ultimate manifestation of good communication because having to share space with someone in this economy usually means tighter quarters and I just really thrive in my own space. I grew up in super tight quarters and have over 11 siblings, so this is just so nice to have. I am sure if I had some crazy 3,000sqft 5BD house I wouldn't mind living with someone else, but that just isn't realistic from a maintenance or utility perspective either.",

Then, you talk about it like adults and equals and figure out how to get your needs met while meeting theirs.  \n\nFor all you know, you may find someone you\u2019re into enough to attempt cohabitation, or find someone who travels enough that you\u2019d cohabitate so rarely, you could deal with it, or maybe you find a single home with a mother in law suite, or a duplex, or\u2026 or\u2026 or\u2026\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to craft an unusual living arrangement, but what works will be based on the dynamics and personalities of specific partners.  Turning people away with a seemingly immutable declaration that is actually open to negotiation and compromise is kind of silly. \n\nIf anyone seriously discusses cohabitation prior to the 6-month committed relationship mark (though, personally, I think 12-18 months is more reasonable), you already know they\u2019ve got maturity issues you don\u2019t wanna deal with.",

Most folks have given at least some thought to how they feel about kids before they start dating.\n\nNow, before the 12-month mark, prospective partners won\u2019t know you well enough to know where you\u2019re headed with this and are unlikely to ever have considered it even in theory.\n\nYou\u2019ll elicit no-fucking-ways from folks it might work with just because you asked them to expand their thinking about how to unconventionally structure the living arrangements of a long-term relationship way too fast and with too little information.\n\nAt the point where you guys are ready to think of becoming life partners, the how-to living arrangement discussion finally becomes relevant, and you can discuss with each other what you need and what you can and cannot tolerate and how to go about meeting needs.\n\nI\u2019m assuming you\u2019ll spend your time as you lead up to that discussion winnowing out everyone who is clingy, needy, high-maintenance, messy, thoughtless, dependent, rigid, or otherwise clearly unsuitable as a long term partner for you.  \n\nBy the time you figure out this is probably the person you want as a long-term partner, you\u2019ll also have a pretty good idea of what you need by way of living arrangements WITH THIS PARTICULAR PERSON to make you happy.  That may or may not mean separate residences.  \n\nAt this point, you cannot know just how far you\u2019d be willing to compromise your must-have list FOR THE RIGHT PERSON - maybe a little, maybe a lot, maybe not at all.  \n\nUntil you know what you need to be in a relationship _with a particular person_, there\u2019s no point in trying to get everyone you\u2019re exploring (especially via OLD!) to preemptively agree to forego something that may not ever need to be foregone.  \n\nAnd, FYI, have you given any thought to the effect a no-cohabitation arrangement would be on your chances of adoption???\n\nMight there come a point where you would consider one roof if it meant you could also have kids living under that roof with you???\n\nPlus, kids are messy, thoughtless, needy, encroaching, and require you to give up sleep and 3 am hobbies, so if you think you might be willing to tolerate all those irritants for the joy of parenthood, it\u2019s not a leap to think  those same compromises might be tolerable for the right partner.  \n\nDon\u2019t drive folks away by requiring them to preemptively consider and agree to a living arrangement that you may later decide is not optimal after all.",

    "postText": "I know the title is a little odd but it was the best way I could summarize what he's done. \n\nI have an 11-year old senior German Shepard. He was hit by a car in 2018 and we went through a very difficult recovery process. He had seizures, urine issues, constant fear of anything going fast near him like I couldn't throw a ball anymore. We had another puppy but our senior was so stressed we had to rehome her. You would have sworn he was displaying abused behavior but he was just scared. \n\nHe's moved past all of that and I'm so proud of him. The vet prescribed zoniamide for his seizures and so far he's been recovering well. We were discussing ways to improve his \"mobility\". Its like a walking cane, but for dogs, and it has sensory objects on the end to prevent him from bumping into furniture. We tested it in the office and his mood improved instantly but at that time I couldn't afford more treatment for him so I opted to come back.\n\nI met D earlier this year while walking him. He's known since day 1 that my dog requires special treatment and I would absolutely provide it. Everything went well and he wasn't controlling or abusive. Everything just \"clicked\" but its my fault because I was too comfortable. We were talking about finances and I told him about my debt and the money I was saving up for my dog. After paying off the debt from his previous treatments I didn't want to open another card so I started saving cash in a little fireproof chest. He stole it. Yesterday, I went to his place I noticed he has a new setup. I was asking him where he got the money from and we fought and he said \"he's half dead anyway, you need to let go\". \n\nHe's not even close to dying. He's a little older but he's nowhere near dying age. We go to the veterinarian regularly and everything checks out as well as it can be given his circumstances. No one has ever mentioned death, we've only been looking at the future and improvements. \n\nI'm so upset, what do I do? We're both students I don't want to call the police and ruin his future but that was for my baby to get what he needed so he can walk around my home comfortably.",

Eventually, the business owner kept coming up with excuses and stopped paying him. Finally it got to a substantial amount and he demanded payment. What did his \u201cfriend\u201d the business owner do? Called the cops and said HE stole from HIM. \n\nThey arrested him despite any evidence, the charges stuck. He consulted a lawyer and was advised to plead Guilty to avoid an extensive jail term. He refused. Lawyer advised him to reconsider because with his record, he will most likely be found guilty anyway and will face years in prison instead of half a year in jail. The county had a 95% conviction rate. \n\nThe guy pled guilty and did like six months. Got out and of course never got the money he earned. Lost his job, his apt and most of his belongings (he was the business owner\u2019s roommate!) and got another notch on his record. \n\nThat happened in New York.",

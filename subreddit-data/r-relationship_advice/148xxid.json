    "postText": "So my bf and I have been together for 2  years and had a year off till we got back together and he was the best first bf ever and he started saving things to his socials that he shouldn\u2019t esp in tiktok there was just a lot of girls and I didn\u2019t know what to do after I caught it we broke up for awhile then we started talking again but things weren\u2019t the same he didn\u2019t want us to go onto each others phones because \u201csome relationships have privacy and nothings wrong w that\u201d so I just gave up after awhile of arguing over it. I still let him on my phone to search things up or watch tiktok when he\u2019s bored he doesn\u2019t have the app himself anymore but I don\u2019t go on his phone or know his password. But when he fell asleep I was on his tv watching YouTube then I went to the playlists and saw some eighteen plus videos and ahegao faces or whatever u call em, like idk there\u2019s so many like hundreds of videos and shorts of bob drops if yk what I mean, I just got sick and shaky so I got my things and left him and blocked him. He said at one time that he saved them when we were broken up so he shouldn\u2019t have to delete everything but why does he have to try and keep them? I found the playlists awhile ago and he said he w deleted them and will never do anything like that again but when I found them still there I just had to get out of there. Am I wrong for wanting him to delete them? He always asks what\u2019s wrong I say nothing but usually I can tell he thinks I know something. And then I end up just finding out something. Am I wrong for wanting us to be able to go onto each others phones or at least not hiding, saving things?",

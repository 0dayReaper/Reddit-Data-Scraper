    "postText": "Recently, accusations have been made against me about my past relationships with a sex worker. There is currently an investigation. \n\nWhen I was 20, I paid a sex worker for her services. I saw her after my job in a hotel, but I originally met her at my job. My coworkers was also involved with her, and they currently being investigated as I am.\n\nThe sex worker lied about her age, and now it look\u2019s terrible for me. Even though the woman is going to testify she misled me, people will get the wrong idea about the situation. Hopefully she doesn\u2019t get into legal trouble herself, but her father has apparently stopped talking to her. \n\nI have to deal with the drama now, and I\u2019m struggling to deal with it. My parents, family, friends, get the wrong idea about the situation, but I don\u2019t know how to save my reputation?",

Because she was a minor? This is tricky. I hope sex-work is legal where you're from otherwise you're both going to get in trouble in one way or another. Unfortunately, there's nothing you can do, and people will judge you for it. Take the L and find a new job if things get too bad. This is one of those things where you have to accept the consequences of your actions. You aren't exactly a victim of anything.",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nMe and my girlfriend has been dating for 1.5 years. During that time, we had broken up a few times due to toxic issues. \n\nLast week she broke things off with me and her reasoning was due to her not trusting me anymore for breaking with her various times during our relationship. We decided to talk about us and she said that she wants to breakup for 6 months so she can see if I choose her. She said she wants a husband that will choose her and that if I really love her, I won\u2019t find anyone else and will still want her at the end.\n\nI want to do this, but I know if I agree to this, I will be hurt for 6 months straight and it won\u2019t allow me to be free and move on. She says this is the only thing that will allow her to trust me again. \n\nI know for a fact she\u2019s not cheating or seeing other guys. She\u2019s just really hurt by our past and wants me to prove it to her this way.\n\nShould I agree to this 6 month breakup?",

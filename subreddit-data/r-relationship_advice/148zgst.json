    "postText": "how can I stop living in the past and get over a betrayal wound with my partner?\n\nLong read at a dynamic situation, apologies. I hope someone reads this because it has been my burden for almost a year now. \n\nI\u2019ve (27f) been dating this guy (26m) for roughly a year now. For the most part we are happy and the only issue we have surrounds what I\u2019m about to discuss here. \n\nIm not sure if this qualifies as retroactive jealousy on my part, as I am ruminating on the past hardcore to my own detriment, but I think it\u2019s more complex than that. \n\nYears before me he dated a girl who abused him mentally, physically, emotionally. She cheated on him constantly and he stayed. He told me it was because it was his first serious relationship and didn\u2019t know how to navigate feelings. He told me he was young and dumb. He and his ex became friends sometime after the break up. \n\nShe became a more prominent figure during the start of his and my relationship. She would say mean things about me to him, gossip about my personal relationships (again to him), try to drive a wedge between us, even tried to get back together with him. He told me he hated her and wanted nothing to do with her. I told him I wouldn\u2019t take him so seriously if I saw  her blowing up his phone again (she would call him 30 times in a row followed by spam texts saying \u201care you with OP?\u201d) I figured he would take care of this to make room for me. Fast forward two months, I\u2019m finding her items at his place (he told me they were just friends so this was really suspicious) and i even found that they were still in communication. He told me it was innocent, sparse conversation just to be nice. He told me she needed a friend. \n\nThis really bothered me. I bottled it up for months until I finally let it all out. The fact that he left the door open for someone who abused and cheated on him, the fact that he kept her as a friend even after she spoke ill of me and tried to get with him numerous times. \n\nIt\u2019s almost a year and I don\u2019t know if I can recover. I\u2019ve been getting better and we\u2019ve had conversations surrounding this. Most of the time he is reluctant to speak of his because it\u2019s \u201cuncomfortable\u201d for him, sure it\u2019s uncomfortable for me too. Shameful even to be dealing with such consuming feelings on a near regular basis. \n\nI think it took a long time to make progress because he would meet me defensively, feeling like he was in the \u201cdog house\u201d. He would even defend her saying \u201cshe apologized\u201d. It took a long time for me to feel heard and understood. He would do the typical guy thing and try to explain \u201cwhat really happened\u201d Making me feel like I had no reason to be feeling this way. He thinks there is the \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cmy side of the story\u201d. I mostly just want to discuss how I\u2019m feeling, not what really went down. I\u2019m convinced they were platonic at this point considering how much he has pushed for his side. \n\nTruth is, I judge his character for all of this. I feel betrayed and distrustful, even though he does everything to cater to my needs and insecurities. I judge him mainly, for allowing someone who abused him to stay in his life. He won\u2019t admit he was manipulated. He just says they had up and downs. He tells me I have my way of viewing it and he has his way. It\u2019s heart breaking. Almost as if he doesn\u2019t see this from how I see this, I can\u2019t have a future with him. \n\nHe denies knowing she had her stuff at his place. Says he didn\u2019t realize. Says it was there because she would crash sometimes. Always followed by \u201cthey were friends they were friends\u201d this is so hard for me to wrap my mind around. I don\u2019t appreciate black and white thinking but in this scenario it\u2019s necessary. \n\nHe has apologized, expressed regret, wishes he handled it better a year ago. He says he didn\u2019t realize how much damage was being done because he was so caught up in how much fun we were having at the start of our relationship. \n\nHe\u2019s very nice, i think it\u2019s both his greatest strength and weakness. I truly believe this series of events is because of his lack of boundaries. He doesn\u2019t enjoy being a hateful or cruel person. Not confrontational in any sense. I think aside from this we could have a really successful life together. We are compatible in every way, our jokes are unmatched and we speak each other\u2019s thoughts. He serves me without any request. I don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t focus on these positive times. I think I\u2019m too insecure, but now writing it all out I feel justified. \n\nI literally need him to express regret to feel better, but the betrayal wound persists. I feel as if we have a weak foundation to our relationship &amp; he feels the opposite. \n\nHow can I move on from thinking we built our relationship on a weak foundation? I have had a series of unfortunate events with relationships before him so I wonder if I\u2019m hyper-fixating on this seemingly minuscule thing for survival.",

    "postText": "I (21m) can say i belong to wealthy family, and i recently met this girl (19f) and we got together for about 5 months now, her parents are divorced and she is living with her mother, they are struggling financially, but since we got together, i always paid for everything when we go out, food, cinema tickets, if she wanted something i get it for her, if i travel i buy her gifts, and i ask her if she want anything, and recently, she just seemed a lot more demanding, and complaining how she hate her life because of financial problems, and saying that she want to buy cloths, shoes, change her phone, go to the salon.\n\nI get monthly money from my father, and it\u2019s enough for me to pay for my monthly expenses( gaz,subscriptions\u2026) and buy things i want online, pay for both our food, pay for the activities I like, and save some money to travel in the summer with my friends.\n\nNow back to her, i explained that to her, and was clearly ignoring her, when she start mentioning that she want to buy that and that and she doesn\u2019t have money, and she hates her life because it\u2019s full of family problems, financial problems and mental problems because of that, and that i never tried to help, i told her it\u2019s not true, i was here for you mentally, physically, and financially\u2026, her response was financially?? And it just kept going on to end in a fight and gn.",

It's one thing to occasionally vent because financial difficulties are common and they do frequently suck, but when it's frequent and especially when she accuses you of not helping, then serious red flags go up.",

It has been FIVE months and that should\u2019ve been plenty enough time to show who you really are to your partner. \n\nShe\u2019s shown that she doesn\u2019t feel bad about withdrawing money from her ATM boyfriend. With how op was describing her behavior (especially in the third paragraph), it sounds like she\u2019s trying to manipulate op so they feel bad enough to buy her things. Her response to the \u201cmentally, physically, and financially\u201d comment also doesn\u2019t sit right with me. So far, the girlfriend has shown that she is only focused on the financial aspect of this relationship. How much longer are you going to put up with this op?\n\nTell me, what does she even contribute to the relationship? How would she react if you stop financially supporting her for a few weeks? Is this relationship going to be stable in the long run if your girlfriend only values you for your money? Is it worth keeping it stable if that\u2019s the case? I say get rid of the gold digger op and find someone that will value you for everything that you provide for them.",

    "postText": "Last night after a small party my ex admitted to have feelings for me. She had a bit much to drink, so I didn\u2019t regard it as anything other than drunk ramblings, but she doubled down this morning when she sobered up. I was honestly taken aback. At this moment she\u2019s in, what she calls, \u201cA Dying Relationship\u201d with her boyfriend of 6 months. \nI also have feelings for her, but I understand the gravity of our break-up was incredibly messy. \nTo be entirely upfront, I am uncertain and quite frankly afraid of the consequences of returning to a failed relationship. On one hand I am happy that my feelings that have been bottled up are reciprocated, but I also know that this could be something she\u2019s doing because she didn\u2019t find what I had given her in her new relationships. \n\nWhat should I do in this moment? I have weighed my options and personally I see it as stop being friends and allow her and myself to move on and find something else or to give her another chance seeing as how we\u2019ve matured greatly since our past 1.5y relationship. \n\nTL:DR \nMy best friend of 5 years admitted to having feelings for me, after not being together for 1y. I am uncertain of the outcomes of my answer to take her back or move on in life without her.",

In my opinion, it seems like she\u2019s only wanting to get back together until she finds another guy to date that\u2019s more interesting. Talk about everything your relationship was missing and how to work on those things. Then see where you two are headed in terms of moving in together.",

            "comment": "Move on. She's trying to monkey-branch out of that relationship to you. Then when when she isn't feeling it with you anymore later on she'll do it to you and just bounce to that new guy. She's basically cheating on this guy by shopping around for a new one without the decency of letting him know she's out. It's common  tactic and why it looks like they move on a week after they break up. They really haven't, they've been testing the water and predating that other guy for months until she was sure enough to move to the new branch.\n\nNever date the same person a second time without them going through some sort of major transformation. Also, never do breaks, only break ups. People use breaks to do grimy stuff like monkey branching so  they don't feel like they cheated if doesn't wok out and they have to come back.\n\nI will say that if you're the one that originally broke up with her, that's a different enough scenario it might be worth it, though the grimy way she's treating her current guy is a huge red flag.",

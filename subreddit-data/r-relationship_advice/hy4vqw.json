    "postText": "Throwaway cause I'm still the only one that knows \n\nBackground: My brother has been staying with us since lockdown, after his University closed. He couldn't stay with our parents cause they just sold the house and moved to a 1 bedroom apartment and our sister lives in a different part of the country. He was the \"oops\" baby so I hope that explains the age gap. My wife and I have a 5 bedroom home but currently don't have children yet (we decided to adopt 2 kids in our 40s) so we let him stay here. \n\nMy brother has always been... Different. He's a bit of a loner and doesn't have a lot of friends outside of his online group. He's a shy geeky kid but he's otherwise alright (or so I thought) when you get to know him.\n\nSo here's what happened\n\nThe wifi doesn't quite reach my brother's room so he usually does his school work and other stuff in the dining room. A few nights ago, I was walking to the fridge after waking up in the middle of the night (wife and I sleep early) and saw my brother working on something out and as I got closer, I saw a very compromising picture of my wife (cleavage shot as she was gardening). He noticed me and quickly closed the window like he was watching porn. I was too shell shocked to say anything at that time and he just smiled awkwardly and ran to his room with the laptop. \n\nWhen I realized that something was up, I knew I had to find out. The next day, I asked my brother to pick up some groceries and some lunch for us and while he was away, I went to his room (something I've never done since he moved) and, well, it wasn't pretty. I saw a couple of my wife's bras and some of her panties which I can only assume he used to pleasure himself. I took his laptop and fuck it, decided to snoop. I knew his password cause I borrowed his Crunchyroll account to watch this anime my friend recommended (I don't usually watch anime). \n\nThere I saw some of the most sickening entries I've read. There were pictures of my wife in a towel, her working out, her in compromising positions, etc. All taken without her consent by the looks of it. The fucker even logs every time he touches himself to the image of my wife. The creepiest part? He sometimes listens in on us when we have sex. My wife can be a bit loud but we didn't think it would be a problem since his bedroom was in a different part of the house (guest bedroom). \n\nI left the room feeling like I needed a shower. It was absolutely disgusting. \n\nNow I don't know what to do. I find myself fighting the urge to pummel him into next week every time I see him. I haven't told my wife yet cause I'm 100% sure she will feel violated and disgusted so I want to find the best solution first before doing so. I so desperately want to kick him out but I he has nowhere else to go. Even if I do, what should I tell my parents? The truth? This will most likely break the family apart. I do plan on telling my wife soon but if I do, I can almost guarantee she would want nothing to do with him and would never want to visit the family if he's around. \n\nI'm so fucking lost right now. Any advice will help. Still fighting the urge to beat my brother to a bloody pulp.\n\nEdit: if you're wondering, I did take pictures as proof.\n\nSmall update: I told my wife. The redditors who said I should tell her first before anything cause she was the victim were absolutely right. I'm giving her all the power to decide what to do about it. A lot has happened but there are still things that need to be settled. Too long to add here and too incomplete to make a new update post. Hopefully we'll have everything settled tomorrow or the day after. I'll write the update once everything is settled and I calmed down. \n\nNo, I'm not going to beat up my brother but I have thought about it. \n\nAnd to the people asking for the pics... You're disgusting. Hope the women in your life are proud of you. That's my wife, please have some respect.",

Thing needs to be purged after securing evidence.\n\n\nI can't imagine dealing with this, it leaves me feeling anxious and ill. And OP please take back all of your wife's clothes from him. She'll probably want to burn it all. But talk to her, let her take control of some of this. I would want to know and I would absolutely want to make sure he kept nothing of mine. \n\nAnd really, I'd burn the stuff. How awful. I'd probably contact police and see about a restraining order at the very least.\n\nThis brother is an adult, this is so far from ok.\n\nEdit: lots of discussion under my comment about the legality of things, taking a laptop being theft and deleting images possibly being destruction of property. Absolutely disgusts me to imagine creep photos being protected, no way. \n\nAlso, I imagine the awkwardness of the brother being confronted about being a perv and losing your home would be enough to sway him to agree to delete pictures willingly and get rid of...*anything else* he's taken. Also the legality of kicking him out, whether he'd leave of his own volition is a big factor, and having the risk of being charged with a crime might help push him out the door.\n\nI think OP should seek out legal advice, for the housing situation, laptop files -- and cellphone as someone pointed out D:\n\n... but I would not be able to stop myself from deleting inappropriate images of myself or a loved one like this. I mean why the fuck not? Not his shit to take and keep. Fuck that.",

Depending on how many passes for the rewrite, the harder it'll become to retrieve the files. I think it goes from a single rewrite, up to 20 IIRC. The more passes you use the longer it'll take but the more secure it'll be.\n\nEdit:Just googled the max passes, turns out its 35, not 20. So even more secure.",

This is due to how SSDs store their data on the chips. The only possibility would be either using ATA secure erase feature sets (which not all SSDs support) to wipe the drive clean or simply destroying/taking away the drive. There is no viable covert operation with a SSD here like some of you suggest. Personally I\u2018d have no issue with the later, if I were OP. What\u2018s the brother gonna do? Sue for the drive? -.-\n\nSame goes for the smartphone although due to different issues. I discussed the very same topic recently with family members as we suspect a teenager to have taken inappropriate pictures of my niece. You don\u2018t know where he saved the pictures to. Could be just the gallery on the phone, could be the Google Drive/iCloud, could be sth like Mega or maybe worse some 3rd party \u201aspy app\u2018, that uses its own cloud storage and is hidden away so you don\u2018t immediately see it. This really isn\u2018t as easy as some make it out to be here.",

I am also an older sibling, so I know how hard it is to switch gears and view our younger siblings as adults. But in this case, you have no choice. \n\nHe needs to be removed from your home and wherever he lands is 100% his problem, I\u2019m sorry. If your wife wants to forgive him and cut him some slack for being 19, that\u2019s her decision that she can make later. For now though, you need to remove the predator from your home.\n\n*edit: spelling",

But also this is a turning point where a fucked up but potentially not hopeless kid (19 is between child and full blown adult, especially if someone is socially immature) could either get support and pushed in the right direction or he could get pushed into further shame and isolation going back to his parents house who never hear the whole story.\n\nBeing open with your family but firm that he either gets help or faces legal consequences seems like setting the best foundation for OP and his wife and his parents to eventually get past this.",

You were doing a kind thing by giving him a place to stay when your parents couldn't. But that was on the condition that he didn't violate you or your wife. He chose to behave inappropriately (which he clearly knew was inappropriate, based on hiding it and running away). He made the choice and now he has to suffer the consequences.\n\nI will say, as someone who was violated by a roommate (not relative) there are a few things that may help as you tell your wife and work through this:\n\nTell her only the details she wants. Keep it vague until she requests more info. Don't volunteer it. Let her ask.\n\nShe needs you to stand beside her regardless of how the family acts. She needs to hear that you will and see it in your actions. Maybe even repeatedly telling her. \n\nWhen you do tell your parents, do not do so apologetically bc you aren't wrong. Your brother is the one who owes the apologies. \n\nI wish you peace through this rough journey. It's not an easy one. But please know that standing beside your wife is right....and if you get backlash for it, the party dishing the backlash is 100000% in the wrong.",

            "comment": "So here's some practical advice as I've had a situation vaguely similar to yours. These perverts not only pleasure themselves but there is a subculture of exposing those pictures to others. They trade them, or share them for others to blackmail the victim for further pics. They do it to their moms, sisters, cousins, etc. and they post it to cesspool sites like 4ch, \"tribute\" websites (they share these pics, jerk off onto them and them upload the pics after jerking off onto them.) So, you're going to need to  do the following:\n\n1. get his pc and download all of the pics to a safe drive that he won't have access to\n\n2. check his gmail, icloud, any other photo hosting/cloud drive in his internet history, etc for additional copies of those pics. If found, delete them, change his password. Also, reach out to the support contacts for wherever you find pics and submit a dmca or revenge porn claim against the account\n\n3. reverse image search all of the pics via google image, tineye, and yandex. If found on other services, see step 2\n\n3. take a drill and run several holes through his hard drive\n\n4. file a police report if you find anything on the internet. He didn't have consent to share the images\n\n\n5. remove him from your home. If he resists at all, cave his fucking face in, call the cops and say he attacked you when you confronted him about this because fuck him. I know it would be a lie and frankly I wouldn't give one single shit about that.",

She's a victim of sexual harassment and yes this will hurt her but it's the fact your brother did it that makes it hurtful, not the fact you told her.

You should tell everyone in your family who will listen, because this is gateway behavior to some much more sinister shit.\n\nIt sucks to hear, and it'll likely be hard for your parents to accept, but the important thing is making your wife feel safe again, and protecting any future victims from your creep brother.

But that isnt your problem, he is the one that should've considered the consequences. He is the one taking creep shots of your wife. He is the one that is being a predator here. I will say he is young and is not thinking with a mature mind, I think being called out and experiencing consequences of this may help get his act together. I knew a person who was doing these kinds of things and it devolved into him ending up attacking and attempting to rape a person, they went to prison for a long time and is now a sex offender for the rest of his life. So these things evolve into worst behaviors.\n\nHe needs therapy to help understand healthy boundaries and how to have a healthy relationship with a woman. I mean I am sure there is soemthing illegal here that can be taken to the police. I would be wary of him putting camera in your bedroom or bathroom as a next step to his creepiness. \n\nProtect your family. Tell your wife and get him the fuck out of you house and away from you wife at all times until he gets better. He is a predator who is preying on your wife.",

I would like to add if your feeling guilty over what might happen to him remember what he's done to your wife he clearly feels is OK behaviour towards a Woman he actually knows which means he will easily feel is OK to do to other Women he doesn't. \n\nBeing VERY generous he may have fallen in with wrong the men online who are influencing his attitudes towards acceptable boundaries with women. I would check his history to see if he been posting in unhealthy websites. \n\n\nRegardless, hiding it or covering for him will not help him and be devastating for your Wife. It's all down to his behaviour = his consequences, you need to ask yourself if this was a guy and girl in work or your wife and your neighbor, deep in your heart would even stop for a moment before acting?? \nHe needs to realise this isn't OK face the results of his actions and you need to support and protect your Wife first.\n\n\nEdit: I also want to add make it plain and clear you stand by your wife and will back her 100% percent if she wishes to cut ties or press charges. Don't let it be one if this \u201di thought she knew that\u201d as she could take actions she doesn't want thinking that it's what you or your parents would want. Spell it out you love her and fully agree and support whatever he wants. Also, don't let your parents play it down, try to shift some blame to her (she shouldn't have worn this or done that etc)or talk her into forgetting it. This would be a betrayal of your Wife and sends the message to your brother that your both overreacting and his behaviour wasn't that bad.",

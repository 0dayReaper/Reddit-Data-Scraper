    "postText": "The time we have spent together has been great; we enjoy each other\u2019s company a lot, but we don\u2019t meet every day (once or twice in a couple of weeks) because we live in different cities and both have full-time jobs. She loves going to the beach, whereas I have been an aquaphobic since my childhood; I don\u2019t feel comfortable whenever I am near a lake or any other large water body. She was out with her friends for some camping over the weekend and wanted to meet later. She decided that she wanted to go to the beach and do some paddle boarding, which I agreed to. We had a plan to meet at her place at 2 p.m.I tried calling her and left her several texts, but she didn\u2019t answer. I thought she might be busy with something. She texted me back at 5 p.m. that she had just reached her home and was in a pretty tired state and wanted to sleep. So I told her that it\u2019s fine and we could do this another day. She left me on read and hasn\u2019t texted or called me since then. I'm not gonna lie, I was pretty upset after she cancelled the plan because I was very excited to go out with her to do something she really loves. So I decided to neither text nor call her after that. And she has done the same. I am a bit sad and don\u2019t have any idea what to do now. Should I text or call her, wait for her to reach out to me, or do something else?",

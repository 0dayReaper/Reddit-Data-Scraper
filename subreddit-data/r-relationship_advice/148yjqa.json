    "postText": "Hi,  \n\nThere\u2019s a women that I have been on several dates with that has expressed her desire to see me again each time. However, she also rarely asks me questions about myself, doesn\u2019t initiate contact, has anxiety medication, and sends dry text messages.   \n\nShe is a lovely lady that I would like to continue dating and many of our values align, but I would like to know how I should approach this. Should I take things extremely slow so she can get more comfortable? Is this a sign of her disliking me, but being too shy or too kind to admit it? She also doesn\u2019t engage when I try to ask about her emotions. However at the end of each date she says she\u2019s interested in seeing me again. What does the community grasp from this?",

This girl likes you, she's shown that by agreeing to see you repeatedly. But she's got some walls up, maybe some past baggage, anxiety, whatever it is. You're not gonna smash through those walls overnight, and you certainly won't do it by pressing her about her emotions.\n\nSo here's what you do: keep the conversation light, engaging, but don't shy away from deeper topics when they come up naturally. Don't play 20 questions, let her reveal herself in her own time. And most importantly, keep showing up. Consistency and patience are your weapons here.\n\nNow about her not initiating contact, give it some time. As she grows more comfortable with you, this may change. If not, then have a real, honest chat about it. Just don't make it an interrogation, keep it Joe Rogan cool. You got this, man. Keep it steady. Keep it patient. You're in the long game now.",

Quite the opposite, actually.\n\nThat being said, if she can't give your emotional connection you desire, there's no point in going further.\n\nTo me it sounds like her medications are keeping her from bonding.  I know someone who was so emotionally imprisoned by his medication that he was kind of a zombie.  Thankfully, he's mostly off and he's doing better.\n\nYou need to talk with her.  Tell her that there's quite a bit you like about her, but that you're not feeling like there's a connection yet.  Ask if there's something you can do to help with that.  If she gives you nothing, there's nothing you can do.  Move on.\n\nIf she is able to give you hints on how to connect with her, make the effort.  You clearly like her, so spending a few weeks trying to break through will ensure that you gave 100%.  If there's no progress, there's nothing you can do.  Move on.",

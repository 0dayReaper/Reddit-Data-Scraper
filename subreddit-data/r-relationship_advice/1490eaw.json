    "postText": "\nSo I (F22) met someone on an app (M28-29), we agreed to be fwb although  he wanted a full on relationship and I genuinely did not/ do not have time to fit in hangouts with a boyfriend into my schedule/nor am I interested in dating in general. \n\nWe were fwb for a while, sex was good and friendship wise we really didn\u2019t hangout much, just texted back and forth sometimes having a deep conversation and sometimes just a general catching up. He would periodically mention dating/being in a relationship and doing cute relationship stuff. Once he joked he got me a ring and I full on freaked out, and then he showed me some game card with a ring on it. My choice is remained unchanged. After about 2 years of being fwb he found someone who wanted to date him and I was happy for him for real, it was nice that he was with someone who could offer more/what he deserved. During his relationship he texted me randomly and said he convinced his Partner to let me and him have sex for one last time. I refused because it sounded like he basically begged her and she said yes to make it stop. \n\nNow: He texted me to tell me that he broke up temporarily with his girlfriend. I asked if it\u2019s okay for him to sleep with me since they\u2019re not technically broken up and he said \u201cwe\u2019re not gonna hold it against each other if we stick around since we\u2019re on a break\u201d. He mentioned that she couldn\u2019t make him finish ever (but that he liked being with her). He mentioned that he likes poc (like me) and not white women (like his former girlfriend), and was trying to rationalise this being the reason for how his sex life is with his girlfriend. \n\nMy question: should I go back as a fwb or am I not seeing the red flags here? Thanks!",

You already know if you want to sleep with him but what is your in game? Do you want a relationship? Are you OK with playing second fiddle? What do you want?",

I'm almost certain that if you asked his current GF about all this, big drama would ensue. \n\nI'm worried about your ability to see red flags, the sex must be godlike for you to not realize all the shady stuff that he's doing.",

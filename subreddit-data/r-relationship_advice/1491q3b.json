    "postText": "So me and my girlfriend, let's call her J, were together for about 7 months. I had just recently come out of a 6 year relationship(let's call her V, she left me) when J and I met. But I thought I was ready for a new one. (In hindsight I wasn't but it really didn't feel like that at the time). So J and I started dating, things were going pretty great. I wasn't crazy in love or anything but we had a lot of fun together. We like the same things, have the same values and have very similar future plans.\n\nNow, me coming out of a long relationship and jumping straight into a new one was starting to affect me quite a bit. I was comparing my old relationship to my new one (I know, big mistake) and this was giving me doubts about J because I didn't feel the same about her as I felt about my ex. On top of that, J is hypersensitive and would on a weekly basis tell me things she didn't like about something I had said or done. Some of those complaints were valid, mostly things that had to do with my ex, V. But also other complaints that I just couldn't accept. This meant that almost every week we had disagreements or small fights, we would be pissed for a day or 2 and then talk it out. We were actually really good at talking about our disagreements and this always felt very mature. But at the same time I was getting really frustrated and doubtful about the relationship because we were having these \"fights\" so often. I also communicated this with her. This of course was not easy for her to hear, and I fully understand that this did not help with her insecurities. One other important part that really didn't work for me is the fact that J would tell me she didn't like something I did or said, but always added: \"But I don't want you to change for me, I just want you to know how I feel about it.\" Like I would understand her side of things better, and sometimes I would, but most of the times I wouldn't because she is so different than me in that regard. I'm not that sensitive and small things don't affect me that much. I don't want to be in a relationship where you are constantly telling eachother about small things you don't like and then NOT expecting the other person to do something with that information. I expect both parties to take responsibility for the feedback they give, and only give it to their partner if it is important enough. Important enough for the partner to then work on!\n\nSo about 2 weeks ago we had another one of our fights and that just broke me. I was so tired of the constant struggle and I just wanted some mental rest. So I decided to end the relationship. She was very sad about it but it wasn't a big surprise for her because I had voiced my doubts before. Neither of us are to blame for this. We both tried really hard and there was a lot of love. But I felt it just wasn't a good match. In the last 2 weeks I've felt sad but also calm. I think I might be afraid of being alone. More recently I've been having this thought of: \"What if we tried it again but differently? Could we make it work? It was also fun when we weren't fighting\". Stuff like that.\n\nI guess the advice that I'm asking for is this:\n\nShould I contact her and talk about our options for a second try? We would try to do it differently. If that is even possible? Or do I just miss her and should I get used to that feeling and accept that it's going to suck for a while? Almost like I am more scared of being alone, so I would rather be with J than alone?\n\nTLDR: I ended my 7 month relationship with J because of constant fights and struggles. But we had a very rocky start because I wasn't over getting dumped yet. Did we get the chance we deserved? Should I talk to J about it? Or am I just scared of being alone and am I only trying to see the good parts of the relationship we had?",

You're only human and there were feelings.\n\nYet, you were clearly not emotionally available to jump in a new relationship, and she didn't deserve it. I can totally understand her frustration, as you basically placed her in the shadow of your ex. Maybe not even on purpose, yet... you need to move on from the past.\n\nIf you jump back at it, without sorting the previous issues, you'll only fight again. Solve the core issue, not the side issues.\n\nRespect her as well, and give her time to heal. She seems decent.\n\nAlso, it's quite shitty to be in the dumpee shoes when the dumper breaks the relationship because it is still clinged on an ex.",

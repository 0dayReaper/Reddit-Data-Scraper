Today the girl who is her client (he tattooed her before) posted a reel by recording him when he was tattooing her that had a \"ily booi\" text on it. I knew that they were friends but should I pursue him or does \"ily\" mean that he is taken? He hasnt reposted or \"answered\" the post on his ig but who knows what happened at the tattoo studio.\n\nTl dr: the guy I love received a ig story from a girl that has a text \"ily booi\" on the screen, could he be taken?",

Also sometimes when he has  nightouts with his friends. Never saw him post sth romantic but a month ago after tattooing this girl they went out to drink and he posted her sitting on the other side of the table without any context so... I met him 2 weeks ago after falling for him around 1,5 months ago and we talked about his artworks.",

The drinks was around a month ago when he tattooed her for the first time.She went back there yesterday after having her first tattoo around a month ago, which is the time he posted her after the session sitting at the other side of the table at a bar. But he normally doesnt post a client when they are hanging out after the session and specifically a picture of a girl sitting on the other side of the table without any context so they are probably flirting.. or dating. I guess that I just didnt want to see it.",

But she already says \"ily\" so she has the courage to say that which makes me think they are in contact a lot, just not publicly.\n\nThanks, nothing to lose but when we talked he didnt seem specifically interested in me, is it possible to understand if a man is into a girl when they first met? Because he could ask my number when I talked to him at his exhibition but he didnt. We just talked about his art and said goodbye. He only asked me my name and my occupation and which cad programs I use at my job which makes me think that he was just being polite.",

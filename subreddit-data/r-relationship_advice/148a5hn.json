    "postText": "I\u2019m not really here for advice as much as I want to confirm that I did the right thing. I am proud of myself even though I am grieving and have been an emotional mess for six weeks. My (now Ex) boyfriend smokes weed for anxiety daily\u2026more than I am comfortable with.  (I didn\u2019t know how much until a few months in of course). Why am I uncomfortable with it?  I\u2019m not exactly sure.  \nHe\u2019s very functional but I think he seems just a bit disconnected sometimes because of it.  Later upon reflection, (when it was too late) I realized it was also due to my custody battle.\n\nWhen we started to fall for each other, I realized we were headed to a serious place and so I told him two months into our relationship that if he wanted to be a part of my and my kids lives, he couldn\u2019t be high around my kids or have his paraphernalia around when they are around.  I told him if that was something that he felt was not a fair ask then we should stop where we were, and try to be friends or go our separate ways. \nHe replied by telling me that he wanted a relationship and to be in my kids in my life, and that he would be sober when he was with us.\nFast forward a few months, and he was never really sober with us\u2026he would just smoke before hand.  He\u2019s fully functional which was why I was torn.\nSo I broke up with him\u2026 I didn\u2019t do it in a great way, because I did it over text.  I know that really hurt him and kind of blind-sided him.  I should have spoken to him about it in person.  I readily admit that.\nI told him before that it was my one dealbreaker, and he didn\u2019t keep his word. I should have told him at the start that it would always be a dealbreaker because my ex tried to make it look like I was a weed addict and and unfit mother during our custody battle when I rarely ever partake.  (He said that I should have told him that to begin with and he\u2019s right\u2026but I felt if it was important to me, it should have been to him)\n\nIt hurts so badly because I really had fallen in love with him and supposedly he had with me. The kids liked him and he would tell me that he loved being with us and it made him so happy. He said we made him a better person and gave him more purpose.  I don\u2019t know if it was all just lip service.  He even said he would love to be a full or part time stay at home partner and help with the kids, pack their lunches and go to all their sporting events, clean the house (he\u2019s super clean) and do yard work.  I always wanted that tbh!\nIt breaks my heart because he really liked being with my kids and they liked him.  He was so good with them\u2026present and engaged\u2026the opposite of their father.\n\nWhen I talked to him on the phone after a few weeks of being broken up (hoping we could work it out or figure it out) he said that he didn\u2019t have the energy to keep up with my family. (Which is what my oldest daughter always said!).  He. Said he was done, he has a lot to work on and I will find someone better.  Maybe he doesn\u2019t want to get hurt again\u2026. I think he\u2019s just not able to step up because that means he has to sacrifice some thing of himself\u2026but I also don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have severe anxiety.  I know he\u2019s sad because though I\u2019ve gone no contact, I can see his Spotify (we shared some playlists) and he\u2019s been listening to only country music for days since we spoke.\n\nI did the right thing, right?\nI never learned what boundaries were or that you could set them until just this year.\nMy needs just didn\u2019t matter much growing up and I didn\u2019t learn to articulate them so I\u2019m learning just now.  \n\nI\u2019m through putting up with men who have no integrity. Be a man of your word (or woman)\u2026it\u2019s a basic standard we should all live by.\n\n**** update: it seems to me after reading all of the comments that everyone has a different perspective on this. There are valid points on both sides, and it doesn\u2019t seem like there is one obvious answer to the whole scenario except that we sure could have communicated better as a whole.  I think I just have to accept that there was a heart to heart and soul to soul connection, but lifestyle factors were prohibitive.  I\u2019ll forever be grateful for our connection, love and good times.",

The normal me would have addressed it with him, but the me that is now has ptsd from an emotionally abusive marriage and dealing with a very large and volatile man.  He terrified me more than once during my divorce over the past few years (to the point that my kids had locked themselves in a bedroom and had a 911 ready to dial).  I learned to be non-confrontational and that Addressing my concerns would result in anger, gas-lighting and stone-walling.  I did apologize profusely to him and admit my culpability in the whole situation. In fact, I did that nearly right away after breaking up. I just needed to be able to calm my nervous system down from the anxiety I was feeling.  \nI immediately got a new therapist, and have been working since then on learning to feel safe talking about my needs and anxieties.  I told him that as well.  \nWe both have trauma and we both have things to work on. I am very aware of my damage and I\u2019m not proud of it\u2026I\u2019m working very hard to heal and be in a healthier place.  \nI just really hoped that we would both be willing to be there for each other as we healed and work through things but there\u2019s a lot at stake emotionally and I think we\u2019re both afraid of failure.  I was more willing to try to work it out but he thought we would never see eye to eye.",

It seems wrong to me to be the one to draw the line and say you're over, and then turn around and say you were the one more willing to work it out. Sounds more like you were more willing to try again, but he's still feeling \"once bitten and twice shy.\"",

One thing I learned is that my nervous system has been stuck on fight/flight for years which is why I have heart palpitations, I can\u2019t relax well and I clearly may over-react to protect myself.  Then I asked if we could discuss things because I felt I had jumped the gun without properly communicating and addressing the issue..  He said yes but I was over-communicative and needy for 2-3 weeks after the break up and I think pushed him away.  \nI totally understand him not wanting to risk the same reaction/hurt again.

(After only a few weeks of dating).\n\nI\u2019m probably one of the most easy to get along with people you could find.  I\u2019m always willing to give concession when someone needs it and I can.  In fact, if you asked anyone who knows me, they would say I give way too much and I\u2019m always prioritizing others over myself.\nThe one thing I\u2019m trying to figure out is whether his habit should be considered \u201cwho he is\u201d or just a habit because I really wanted (want) to love him for all of him.  I loved him through times of anxiety and when he retreated from stress\u2026I want to accept someone for all their traits both good and difficult.  I just never knew what to view this as.

I was so incredibly good to him and he was good to me.  We spoiled each other and I only asked for one concession. He asked me for multiple concessions in my lifestyle and habits and I conceded many of them.  I planned things for us, took him to the hospital when he needed waited for his procedures &amp; took him home.  I drove over an hour to bring him soup when he got sick and made his meals and cared for him for 2 days while he was sick.   Drove hours to help him when his car had a problem (only a few weeks into our relationship), took care of his dogs, helped him clean his home and allowed his dogs to sleep on my bed and couch when I don\u2019t usually allow that.  I had an ongoing health issue from a surgery and it really messed with my sleep but I did it because I knew it made him feel comfortable and supported.  I would rub his injured shoulder frequently, make him tea at night and sexually he was incredibly satisfied.  We had a very good relationship outside of this one thing.  We literally argued only twice ever but never ever were disrespectful or said anything damaging.  He still knows I\u2019ll drop everything if he is ever in need and vice versa.  \nOffering to make the one concession I asked for and then not holding to his word is not okay in my view.  He shouldn\u2019t have offered to do it if he wasn\u2019t going to or he should have told me he was not able/struggling.",

I\u2019m an incredibly energetic and active person who likes a lot of sports.  Most men my age aren\u2019t as active as I am.

In fact, I hadn\u2019t even entertained it until I met him.  He convinced me that he wanted a family life, but did not want his own kids due to anxiety running, and his family.  \nI haven\u2019t dated for 17 years and myself, battling anxiety and PTSD from very nearly losing two children over the last 10 years. (Watching one flat line in my arms) and an emotionally abusive and threatening ex.\nYes, I have issues and we talked about them. Yes he has issues and we talked about those as well. \nIt\u2019s an ongoing process to sort myself out.  I am working on it very actively.\nHe\u2019s not completely innocent in this scenario either.  He told me I treated him better than anyone ever has and we both felt emotionally safe with each other, which neither of us had felt in a long time\u2026 I made a mistake and I owned up to it, and I apologized directly and profusely.  However, he also made a mistake by offering to commit to something that he couldn\u2019t back up.  Maybe he didn\u2019t know that he couldn\u2019t. I do believe that he is in denial about being fully dependent. \nHe is a very good man.  I shouldn\u2019t have stated that he couldn\u2019t step up to being a real man\u2026he had the best of intentions.  I wouldn\u2019t say a bad thing about him and I think he feels the same about me.\nWe both have a lot of trauma to overcome and sort through.",

As you said yourself - breaking up over text was not the way to go, but otherwise - you set a boundary, he crossed it, you broke up.  That's the way they are supposed to work.\n\nIn your ex's defense I also smoke for anxiety (and nausea in my case), and while I have been working on alternate solutions with my doctors, so far nothing else has panned out, but it's not as if I can just quit, no matter who is asking or why they are asking.  I am absolutely miserable without it.\n\nAnd if someone asked me not to around their kids, to me that would mean \"don't medicate in front of them\", and I would do exactly what your ex did: smoke before and hope it lasts, or sneak off and re-medicate if it doesn't.\n\nI 100% understand your reasons for it being a dealbreaker, but despite it being legal in 20 states, the public perception that anyone who even *puffs* a joint is a stoner who sits around listening to Pink Floyd and being all \"what if like...what I see as blue, you see as green?\", when a lot of us, who have chronic health issues are just rendered normal/functioning.\n\nBut yes - you did the right thing.",

I talked to a handful of friends, and I found out that two of my good friends actually rely on it as well for their anxiety. They are great moms and both have had good jobs &amp; healthy families.  I wish I had spoken to them more before hand And addressed it with him before my anxiety about it hit a pinnacle.  That\u2019s a lesson I\u2019ve had to learn the hard way.  \nHe definitely sees it as medicinal but he also just enjoys it.  \nSometimes he gets so high He does seem detached. It\u2019s not very often &amp; especially not during the day.  Just sometimes at night he smokes too much and it feels like he\u2019s not really his present self.\nI wish our situation had been different and I would have gone about it all differently but I guess that\u2019s life.  Could\u2019ve, would\u2019ve, should\u2019ve. \nBy the way, have you ever thought about psychedelic assisted therapy or micro dosing?  You might do some research on that\u2026I\u2019m so sorry you struggle with anxiety so badly.  It\u2019s really hard for a Nuro typical person to understand severe anxiety. I wish I could understand it better.  I also wish I could know what it was like to be high and be functional because if I smoke weed, I am completely non-functional so that\u2019s my frame of reference, which isn\u2019t his.",

I dated a guy who was quite literally high 24/7, and you hit the nail on the head. Existing, functioning, and completely unavailable for a true romantic connection. He was surprised when he wanted to be more serious and I couldn\u2019t understand why, because I didn\u2019t even know *him* at that point regardless of the time we spent together. I had very clearly been kept at an arms reach or shut off, because he was obviously stoned. It\u2019s like the different between a buzz and being drunk. \n\nYou can *also* abuse prescriptions as a method of escapism, there are absolutely people doing the same with weed. If you\u2019re constantly running there\u2019s no way you can support your friends or romantic partners in a healthy way.",

What matters is OP said she didn't want it around her kids and ex-BF was too addicted to stop. \n\nIf anything, OP the first time she realized he was high should have reminded him of her boundary, and the second time should have broken up with him. \n\nAs I recently read in another post, a boundary is not controlling, it just tells the other person that if they choose to go past this boundary then you will do something. He chose to go past her boundary multiple times and she did what she said she would if he did that.",

(Though he would also keep the house and yard up which, is a full time job, trust me!) \nHe never brought that up again and is actually a very hard worker.  He doesn\u2019t like his company but He really likes his job. \n\nMind you, he\u2019s a disabled vet with PTSD and gets 90% disability (so he would contribute financially) but also has a f/t job.  \nHis house is always clean, organized and he\u2019s fairly disciplined for someone who is high so much.  He has pretty high anxiety.  Still\u2026I didn\u2019t like the idea of enabling him to have less structure and purpose in his days.

He became financially very successful but became a pretty dead beat partner and father.  I would rather be with a man who values family and time with loved ones over $$.\nI don\u2019t think it was.

My dad never used near or in front of me, didn't know it existed in my home until my early 20s. \n\nIs this guy like.... stumbling around stoned??

But seems like you have a strange relationship with cannabis. I personally was glad I had a dad who shared his drug use experiences with me, it took the novelty of exploration out of the equation because he told me exactly what it would be like. It actually was a better deterrent than anything we were taught by DARE in the 90s. \n\nYou sound like you have issues with cannabis. If its not legal in your state? My argument does not apply, or, if he is fucked up around your kids. Also not ok. Otherwise what is the harm??? Further more im 36 and if my husband aged 42 told me to stop smoking on some morality based principles I'd kindly tell him to fuck off. \n\nYou have nothing but good things to say about him and how he treats your kids otherwise so I struggle to see the issue.

So when you are high, you feel better, but when it wears off, its worse off than when you started.

I have no idea what u look like but it\u2019s pretty obvious everyone is hotter as a young adult than an older in most cases. You smoking with him sometimes is not the point the facts are your trying to control something he already been doing. He\u2019s not your kid. You said your kids are older and well behaved so how could moms boyfriend smelling like weed or them seeing paraphernalia influence them I don\u2019t get that. Look at yourself with this laundry list of stuff you got going for you NOBODY CARES about your finances that isn\u2019t a character trait , nobody cares you take care of your kids that\u2019s literally your job once you have them. I never said having kids makes anyone a poor mate but in your case obviously it was the deal breaker those where your words not mine. Him using  viagra or whatever else is also irrelevant that just gives you the confidence you seek so bad. At the end of the day your a single mother in your mid 40\u2019s dating down that\u2019s for a reason. I can see the reason. Your never wrong and try to parent snd police everything. As far as you always being with younger men all that tells me is your an immature women or men your age now your tricks classic cougar fr. You like to manipulate and use all your so called good qualities are accolades to justify it. Listen to yourself I own 2 homes wth does that have to do with u not being able to keep a man young old or in between obviously these men are not worried about that they rather be away from you.Self reflection is key and you need to start doing more of it. Not just for yourself but for your kids. They see this behavior too you think they are not seeing all these young men you talk about? And your right you could find someone hotter and I hope you. And I hope that person has kids to blend the families and you guys are a strong United front. That\u2019s what u need a man who\u2019s not going to put up with ultimatums and \u201cnon negotiable\u201d I hope blessings come your way I mean that from the bottom of my heart.",

I never insulted you just made a hypothesis based of what you said. If you feel that way I apologize I\u2019m just blunt not trying to hurt anyone. The reason why a relationship starts doesn\u2019t matter it\u2019s how it finishes. I work with a woman who\u2019s 55 who loves basketball and so do I doesn\u2019t mean I would ever date her. I speak from experience. I\u2019m 29 soon to be 30 and , dated a woman 41 and she was so chill and cool. She understood me and it was zero pressure the entire time. She never brought any headaches or issues and even if she didn\u2019t like something I did she knew exactly how to express those without giving me a headache or coming off as my boss. You should do the same just relax keep going to your therapy and working on yourself. Be the strong woman I know you can and stop manipulating men or trying to control them because that is what your doing right now.",

They are not his kids, but my big concern was that having someone who was using cannabis chronically would end up hurting me if my ex decided to try to use it against me in court.  He already tried once and I was a casual user at best maybe twice a week for a few months during a highly stressful time\u2026 if that much.  I wish I had explained this to him in the beginning, but it didn\u2019t really occur to me why it was such a big deal to me until I was able to calm my nervous system over the week ensuing the break-up.\nI appreciate hearing about your experience though, because it helps me see that this, in fact could have been an issue and I am my kids\u2019 Rock.  Losing custody would wreck them and me.",

More people should be like you. \n    If he was really concerned about you he should have taken what you told he repeatedly to heart. Hi could have went 8nt8 another room to smoke the can out when finished. He didn't have to do it blatantly in front of the kids. \n    Hang in there. You didn't do anything wrong except be a good person and look out after your kids. You are a good person.\n    I smoke but would really love to meet someone like you.",

I think part of this is because his military training injury prevents him from doing any of the careers that he really wanted to do. He likes his current job but the company is toxic. I think if you could choose now because he can\u2019t do the other things he wanted to do, if she would just run a dog rescue.",

    "postText": "My long-term partner and I go to college together and live in the same unit. Things are usually pretty fun and playful during daily life, and I generally love peaceful living with each other at home. I have a tendency to become emotional and dump my feelings on her fairly often, which I hate doing, but I have difficulties stopping myself. I feel like most of my depressive/anxious thoughts stem from her in some way, generally about me feeling mistreated, less loved, and not cared for at times. I really wish that she could just listen and make adjustments, because to me it would feel very easy coming from that side, but I understand that we function differently.\n\nLately I've mostly been struggling by her tendency to go back on promises and not stick to her word. I, as most people, greatly value honesty and integrity, especially in what we hope would be a continuing long-term relationship. It's summer break from college and she's been at her parents' house for the past few weeks. She comes from a rich background, so clearly she prefers to be there in comparison to our small off-campus unit that we share. What has me feeling invalidated is that she doesn't seem to care whether she and I are physically together anymore. She treats it like I'm weird for feeling unhappy about spending potentially a month or longer away from each other (this same thing happened last year, and I was certainly unhappy). I ask how she would feel in my situation, but it's unfair because she has family and close friends in this area, whereas I do not; she says she'd be fine and actually enjoys living by herself. I'm an introvert, and I do not derive much fun by having personal outings, but she can't seem to understand this.\n\nWe've been video chatting every night since she's been gone. Prior to summer, she promised be that she'd be out of town for only two weeks, and then once she's back we can take time for each other over the summer as desperately needed. As of right now, it's been three weeks since she left because she realized \"last minute\" that Father's Day is the upcoming Sunday. With some hesitation, I'm willing to overlook this. My fear is that this is mostly an excuse to stay at her parents' house for longer, despite promising to come back to me before then. Of course this makes me feel neglected and less important, and the emotional co-dependence signals me to believe that she needs to rectify this unfairness that's leaving me feeling mistreated. She treats it like it's my problem to deal with and find ways to feel better on my own. I'm essentially wasting my life away waiting for her to come back, and she hates that I'm doing that, but I'm too centered on wanting to spend time with her as I really wanted to.\n\nAs mentioned, I tend to quickly become emotional about certain unfair circumstances, even when they are as simple as saying I miss her and her not saying it back. She says that my emotions are intense when this happens, but I should clarify that I never become angry, just very sad. I try to be reasonable, but I also tend to grasp at any reasoning to formulate a point that she's causing some type of problem toward me. After some moments of my sadness, she naturally enters this numb state, where she either has nothing to say or automatically replies with sweet nothings. At this point I begin to feel hopeless that anything she says will be pointless, and that the cycle will inevitably repeat itself because she's done nothing to help me feel better. I've been struggling especially lately because I do have a tendency to depend on her emotionally, but I always thought that as normal. She has told me so many promising things and made to many pledges to our love that aren't holding up, and every time she doesn't stick to her word I interpret that as a threat to the relationship. Sometimes I feel like I have to say shocking things just to get her attention, or to check if she really wants to be here, and this makes me feel horrible. I'll ask if she even wants to be in this relationship and she'll say \"I do,\" but I automatically bite back by asking why she won't do anything to improve her side of things; it makes it hard to believe that she still wants this, but it confuses me that she'd want to keep going if she secretly wanted to split up, so maybe she really does want to stay together despite all the needless bullshit we put each other through.\n\nTL;DR: In brief, I feel like my partner isn't trying for our relationship while telling me that my emotional problems are my very own to deal with. I tell her how hurtful her actions and broken promises are, but she numbs over and never tries to solve the issue. I desperately don't want to lose this relationship, and I'm definitely not in a good position to deal with those types of consequences (i.e. moving into a new place). I just wanna feel loved, important, and needed :( but she says this means I'm a co-dependent. What could I do to move past this hump without pushing her out of my life?",

    "postText": "\nThrowaway, for obvious reasons. \n\nI (20F) have been dating my BF (22M) for almost nine months. I regularly take birth control, but alas I ended up pregnant. Took the test a few days ago and I\u2019m about a month and a half along, give or take.\n\nMy BF and I have sex frequently. When we started having it without a condom once I got on birth control, we had a long talk about potential accidental pregnancy. I was honest with him and told him that, while theoretically I\u2019d choose to get an abortion, I can\u2019t guarantee that my mind wouldn\u2019t change once it was no longer a hypothetical, and he could use condoms as an additional layer of protection if that concerned him. He declined. \n\nI told him about the positive test, and he freaked out. I\u2019m not over exaggerating when I say he cried, screamed, had a meltdown, the whole nine yards. I felt horrible, and honestly still do. He\u2019s starting medical school in the fall, while I\u2019m still an undergrad. \n\nWell, once the shock wore off, he asked when I was terminating it. I was caught off guard and told him that a lot more thought and discussion is going to have to go into such a life altering decision. He got super angry and accused me of baby trapping him. \n\nI\u2019m floored. I brought up the initial conversation we had, when he declined to add condoms as an extra means of protection, and he went on to accuse me of stopping my birth control behind his back. He also told me I was ruining his life and that his family would despise me for doing so. He already told his mother and to say she\u2019s upset is an understatement.\n\nI told him that the fact that he thinks I\u2019d ever do something like that to him is deeply hurtful, then left to get some space. It\u2019s been a few days, but today he came by and begged me to talk, apologized, and said we should discuss our options.\n\nI told him straight up that if I decide to keep the baby and he wants nothing to do with it, then fine, I don\u2019t want his money, either, and he can stay out of our lives. He was surprised by this and said of course he\u2019d be involved..as long as we do a paternity test. So first I\u2019m a baby trapper, and suddenly I\u2019m a cheater, too? This is the same guy who has his fingerprint on my phone.\n\nThis whole situation has just left me so bothered. I can\u2019t look at him the same ever since he accused me of baby trapping him AND cheating. Heat of the moment reaction or not, I can feel myself beginning to resent him. \n\nIf I do decide to keep the baby, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be able to look at him the same. I was honestly relieved when he left my place today. At this point I don\u2019t even know if our relationship is salvageable. \n\nI just have no idea what to do and feel so pressured into termination because of how upset he is, even though I\u2019m already so attached to this baby :( is there any coming back from this?",

He refuses to get a restraining order so now I have to pull my daughter from the school so she can\u2019t find my kids while she continues to stalk my ex. She doesn\u2019t care about me anymore but doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t start again. This has been going on for 7 YEARS!! I\u2019m going to take a restraining order on her now because now she knows what I look like and she\u2019s trying to follow me on Facebook with fake accounts. His recent ex is an alcoholic and the reason I spent 2 years in court getting full custody. The nightmares and panic attacks my kids got going to school so close to his house and during his custodial time was heart wrenching. All the times my kids had to talk to police about his girlfriend and their dad calling them liars so he could keep the girlfriend was appalling. They are well adjusted now ( 6.5 years later) and think it\u2019s funny karma that the ex still stalks him but I know how crazy she is, it worries me.",

I'd have the conversation with him that given his reactions to this, especially given it takes two people to make a baby and HE CHOSE not to wear condoms, that he is just as responsible for this situation as you are. But given his reactions, there is no way you see this relationship continuing. He gave zero thought as to how you are feeling/ dealing with the news, and it was all about him.\n\nRegarding the baby, the choice is ultimately up to you. Do get a paternity test for both of you. I understand that you feel attached to your child already, but you do need to consider if you are actually ready to look after this child long term. Are you able to support yourself and a baby financially? Babies are extremely expensive. Do you have any family that can help you, because you will need help looking after both yourself and your child. Who is going to watch your child when you are at work/school? Also your BF will likely be in this child's life for 18 years or more. Are you ready to co-parent? Are you okay with your child being possibly exposed to your BF's parents who will likely resent this child given what your BF said. \n\nGood luck with your choice.",

I love my baby more than anything but I am so thankful that I am able to only focus on him bc I think I might go insane if I had to work and take care of him. \nI can tell you that if your boyfriend is starting medical school in the fall he will not have a lot of time, if any, to help with the baby. He also won\u2019t really have money to financially contribute much until after he finished residency 9+ years down the road. I\u2019m not sure how close you are to your family, but you will have to potentially lean on them a lot to help raise this baby, especially if you\u2019re still in undergrad. It\u2019s a rough road being a single mother when you\u2019re just starting out in life, but if you\u2019re committed women have been making it work for forever.

A lot of comments have mentioned finances and medical bills, so I\u2019m going to clear a few things up, as well as things with his mother. \n\n1. We are Canadian, so medical bills are not an issue and giving birth won\u2019t put me thousands of dollars in debt. \n\n2. I have a full ride scholarship to my university. I just finished second year, and will have third year almost wrapped up by the time I give birth. I was born and raised in the city where I attend university, so being isolated or far from a support system isn\u2019t an issue. \n\n3. I am fortunate to come from a good family. My siblings are much older than I am and have stable careers as well as partners of their own, while my dad is retired and lives nearby. I know he would be willing to help with the baby if I choose to have it. Unfortunately my mother passed away last year.\n\n4. As far as I know, his mother likes me. She has had conversations about safe sex with him. According to him, she alluded to any baby he\u2019d have before marriage as a \u201clife ruiner\u201d and \u201cirreversible mistake\u201d. She\u2019s not religious or opposed to abortion, and seems to be in that camp right now. I haven\u2019t spoken to her since he broke the news. I\u2019m afraid to.\n\n5. My dad knows and is willing to help and be supportive either way, which I\u2019m thankful for. He, like a lot of you, has advised me to end the relationship regardless of whether or not I keep the baby.",

Accusing you of baby trapping and then of cheating, combined together is just too much. I'd understand the paternity test, if it was asked for very gently, it is a life altering situation. But this way? It's just too much. \n\nRegardless, if you decide to keep the baby, his money would not be for you. It would be for the child, to guarantee the child gets the best chance at a nice life. Regardless of what you can provide, is it your right to deprive the child of what is rightfully theirs? I mean even if you don't need it at the moment, you can at least establish a college fund.. there's no need for any heroes here. It took two of you to create this baby.",

I am not you though so my opinion is just that. If you decide to go through with the pregnancy, you will most likely not receive support from him, at least not emotionally. I HIGHLY doubt things will get any better with him. That will be very hard not just for you but also for the child. I know lots of people who grew up without a father or with one who didn't really care, and while they are more or less okay now it is very hard on a person emotionally and almost always leads to some sort of emotional issues.\n\nIf you don't want to terminate, there is always adoption.

One of my favorite co-workers/friend got pregnant when she was 14.  She didn\u2019t get any help from dad(he was15) and she moved in with her sister.  She was mostly on her own at this point but she got her high school diploma, she went to college and came to work with us when she was 19 making good money. She moved up to supervisor in a year then moved to my department (when she was 21) where we did more specialized work and had more responsibilities then her previous department.  My point is, she raised a well adjusted boy on her own and the only help that she got from dad was that his mother would watch her son for two hours, from the time he got out of school to when she was done with work.  If she can do it on her own I\u2019m sure that you would be able to do it as well if you choose to go forward with the pregnancy.

That being said\u2014I thought I was pregnant while in grad school. My ex\u2019s reaction was so hurtful. It was basically that now I won\u2019t finish my program (something he did not want me to complete) and that he would deal with me forever. It felt like he was trying to baby trap me. He belittled me and shifted blame on me for not being more careful despite his fucking bitching of putting a condom on and me being on birth control had reduced my drive. He didn\u2019t even want to come with me to the appointment. I was 10 days late and my pregnancy test was inconclusive. (I found out later why) I am ALWAYS on time. My relationship was failing because I was falling out of love with my ex. He kept showing me things that I knew were deal breakers. This last reaction really killed me. \n\nThe day that I went to the OBGYN to make sure I was pregnant, my best friend sat with me and said: \u201cno matter what happens I am here for you.\u201d I knew that I would get an abortion. I knew that his reaction changed my views on him and that I would never be able to look at the child from a man that hurt me and attacked me so much when I needed him. I had a decision. On the way to the exam room I stood up and saw that I bled on the seat. I got my period. \n\nI sighed deeply. The universe had given me a sign and once I felt safe and spoke with people I love, I knew what I had to do. \n\nOP, surround yourself with people that love you. This man\u2014was so fucking hurtful. Once in a safe environment, talk about your feelings. Only YOU know what is right for you. I cannot tell you what to do. But I will tell you this. My partner was not my person and would have made my life and my child\u2019s hell. I would have had the abortion hands down. \n\nAll the people that I have known that had one\u2014DO NOT regret it. They understand it was the right thing. It is not a fancy or magical wand that removes the issue, but they did it. A kid is magical\u2014when you are ready. While no one can tell you if you are ready\u2026you know who isn\u2019t? Your boyfriend. He had no issue cumming in you but wants to take a paternity test because that is WHAT he thinks of you. You deserve so much more. I hope you do what is right for you. Forget him. \n\nSending you love, and luck OP.",

Throwing a childlike tantrum and hurling accusations is not a mark of an adult who is involved in a relationship. \nIt's not he wasn't aware of what the consequences would be of not using condoms. She told him in clear detail. \nInstead of trusting accusations, first of baby trapping him and then of cheating him, he could have sit down and have a proper discussion. \nI don't get why people who are not mature enough to handle serious conversations get into relationship without thinking of what may happen.",

Our baby is now over a year and we just broke up again. He's only ever been a good dad when we were together, and even then he was iffy. He's mostly a dead beat now. I wish I would have left him sooner, honestly. There is no coming back from it. Regardless of if you keep the pregnancy. If you terminate, you might regret it and hate him. If you keep, that's another long stressful journey ahead of you. Do what's best for you! \n\nAt the end of the day, if he wants you to terminate and he's persistent on doing so leave, regardless if you keep it or not.  He'll probably treat you like shit while you're pregnant, have resentment to you or the baby, and have a hard time being a good dad. \n\nLeave! Please feel free to dm me! I've been there!",

No one else can make that list for you because one persons \u2018pro\u2019 is another\u2019s \u2018con\u2019.\n\nAs for your bf- I wouldn\u2019t be able to look at him the same or trust him. We can\u2019t control what we feel but we can control our actions. He chose to act without thinking. The accusations are what kill it for me, not so much the freak out.\n\nI would break up with him but that\u2019s me. If you do want to keep the baby, tell him you\u2019d prefer him not to be involved at all but its ultimately his decision but he needs to be all in or completely out. He can\u2019t be half &amp; half or change his mind later. \n\nI hope you have a good support system either way. Good luck!",

    "postText": "I talked to this guy for several months. I made it clear when things first started that it would just be casual. However, due to \\*many\\* comments he was making, I felt it was necessary to check in with him on how he might be feeling, as well as address the boundaries. Anytime I wanted to do that, he would immediately shut down. It was well-intended, but he claimed I was trying to be argumentative.  \n \nSo, I stopped, as it made him uncomfortable. He started to become a little possessive it seemed during this time, mentioning that he didn't want me sleeping with anyone else. This \\*prompted\\* that same conversation because what else am I supposed to say? So I ask him, \"do you want to date me?\" And he immediately began freaking out and getting angry with me that I would ask such a \\*wild\\* question and that I was clearly overthinking this. So I said, \"Okay, well unless we are exclusive, I can sleep with whoever I want and if you don't agree - then we don't have to sleep together\". This made him upset, but he seemingly agreed with that. \n   \nHe begins opening up to me, telling me about how he's been really hurt in his past, has trust issues, a bad home life etc.   \n\nWe continue hanging out as normal. A few weeks goes by and the L word is slipped out. Twice. I confront him about it and he blatantly lies about it. From the previous hangouts, conversations, and other vibes, I tell him that I've actually grown to like him and would like to try to hangout more than we are + go more places together. He agrees and says that he also wants to go places with me and open up to me more, but not if I'm talking to other guys.   \nI tell him that I'm currently not. However, he begins backpedaling during this time and tells me I must've cancelled the other day bc I was meeting up with another guy. I reassure him that there are no other guys.   \n\nI visit him a few more times and he is very sweet. He tells me that he cares very much about me. Then, I ask him why he lied to me about someone I was interested in having a girlfriend, when he does not. He gets upset and says that I'm likely talking to and sleeping with \\*many men\\*. This is sort of offensive to me, but I do end up showing him my phone which is dry and he goes completely silent and says \"don't care\". He then is being super cold to me, so I leave.   \n\nWhen I get home, I open up to him about how I've been hurt similarly to him in the past and that I care very much about him among other things about how I would be patient with him. He responds \"ok?\". This makes me upset lol. I ask him what is going on and why he's being like this. He responds \"you're different and have issues and you're acting like I was pursuing you when I never was\".   \n\nI send a message back telling him that he is projecting his insecurities and that I tried to have open communication the entire time. He then says \"glad you aren't my problem\". He sends me another message and I never opened it. A few weeks later I post that I'm out with my friends and he deletes me immediately.   \n\nI feel terrible to be honest. I really did end up liking him and I feel like I went against my better judgment. However, I really don't know if I did \\*overthink\\* things like he said and that he didn't actually like me like that. I've had long term relationships, but I always want to get better at being a good partner. I'm genuinely confused lol.  \n \nTL;DR A guy acted interested in me but when I started to reciprocate he immediately pulled away and started to what I think is, gaslight, me. He has opened up to having severe trust issues and being cheated on in the past. If I really care about him, is there anything I can do?",

He wants to cry about his life, but when you can/try to relate he completely invalidated you to make himself the \u201creal\u201d victim again. He said the L word twice and now he is gonna act like he never liked you? Cap. Dating him would be a nightmare if he is this insecure, jealous, manipulative, and victimizing this early on.",

He wants all the benefit of being emotionally close to you - including being able to \"possess\" you and control your activities - without having to be vulnerable and face his own feelings like a grown man. \n\nSounds like once he realized he'd shown his hand a little too much, he freaked himself out and took it out on you. He's trying to turn the tables now and be an ass to convince you it was you who blurred the boundaries instead of him. He's a child saying \"nu uh, YOU did that\" after he clearly shat the bed here. \n\nThis is someone who's so afraid of his own feelings he'll wreck anyone that gets in his way. He can't handle that he has feelings for you so he projects onto you, he can't handle that he's jealous of you so he tries to made you feel bad about talking to other people, he can't handle that you want to talk honestly so he keeps you at arm's length so that you can't. \n\nClassic man-child. Is there potential that someday he'll grow up and learn to handle himself better? Sure. But it'll take therapy, not you, to make that happen. For now, get this guy the fuck out of your life, he's wasting your time and punishing you for his own shortcomings.",

Playing the flip-flop game with your emotions and refusing and deflecting having a grown up conversation is very telling. He continually accuses you of entertaining other guys and yet was possessive of you like you were an object to be possessed. I\u2019m sorry, but no, you are a human being with feelings and emotions and any guy who truly respected you would not shut down during serious conversations. He was playing high school games with you. It\u2019s time to leave him in the past. He sees nothing wrong with his behavior so he doesn\u2019t see any reason to change how treats you. The more you go back to it, the more he feels he can walk all over you and that\u2019s not okay. \n\nDo some soul searching and figure out what it is you want out of relationship and what your boundaries are. Someone who truly loves you for you will never make you second guess where the relationship stands. He needs some serious therapy, because not healing the past trauma will only tear apart a new relationship. Same for you if you also struggle with trust issues or what have you. \n\nWishing you all the best!!",

I'm guessing he acts this way because he's emotionally stunted, incredibly immature and needs years of therapy (I'm actually saying this kindly not as an insult because therapy is a good thing) but you really shouldn't make it your problem anymore.",

You're better than that. You deserve better. Period. \n\nDon't waste your time, I promise there's much better out there for you. I found my happy ever after in my late 30's, and once upon a time, I thought that was so old and late lol . But trust me, it was worth the wait. Never settle.",

    "postText": "My bf and I have been together for four years now, we have been living together for 3 and we now have a baby and I feel like a mother to my bf more than his partner. My boyfriend and I have a good relationship however he lacks responsibility. In short, I\u2019m always the one doing all the housework and cooking. I never seem to have time for myself until an hour after my baby goes down (I clean after he\u2019s in bed) because I am always up and doing things. He never does his laundry and rarely ever cleans his cats litter box (two of them) so the house always smells bad. In the beginning, I use to have to remind him to brush his teeth before bed. He recently lost his job and we were two weeks late on rent this month and I can\u2019t stop thinking about next month.  I have been considering moving out and being a single mom however I\u2019m nervous about custody and then having to find daycare and a job, not to mention I\u2019m supposed to go back to school in the fall. I feel like it would be harder for me because again I have to do everything. We are constantly fighting and we have the same talk everyday. He just keeps telling me \u201cI will be better for you, for us\u201d \u201cI will clean more. I will do the dishes more\u201d and then he will finish cleaning but then doesn\u2019t do anything the rest of the week. I feel like all we do is go around in circles. I hate change and I\u2019m scared what everyone is going to say if we do split. I already get looks because I\u2019m a young mom. Anyways I\u2019m not sure if I sound crazy and maybe things are actually good and I\u2019m just convincing myself that he\u2019s the best I can do because he\u2019s loyal? I don\u2019t know. I just want to be happy and I don\u2019t want to fight anymore because I mentally cannot do it anymore.",

It\u2019s still difficult to know that I will miss out on half of her life. That being said, I NEVER regretted leaving him. You are not a slave. He is old enough to get his shit together \ud83e\udd74. You will eventually find a real partner that will support you and help you. Be strong !",

            "comment": "My dear, you\u2019re already doing EVERYTHING. If you leave, the difference is you\u2019d have school to add to that load and possibly childcare costs(who\u2019s babysitting the kids now for when you need to run errands?). Do you have family nearby like parents who would gladly watch the baby while you\u2019re at work and at school? If you have that support system in place, then my advice would be to leave since you\u2019re already doing everything. \n\nYou mention that he lost his job and while that\u2019s not an issue(since you didn\u2019t explicitly mention it), it also means money would be tight and you might need to find a job either way. Also, if you do leave, depending on where you are, you could file for child support. That might help some. \n\nI hope my advice helped you. If this was me, I\u2019d look at my support system that\u2019s around and if it\u2019s sufficient enough, I\u2019d move out. The most important thing is finding care for that baby so you can work and go to school.",

I have my mom but she owns a business and is back in school so she\u2019s always busy. She does however take him on Saturdays but I always end up deep cleaning and catching up on chores. My dad and his wife possibly could watch the baby but I\u2019m not the biggest fan of his because he treats me like a maid as well. The problem is daycare costs and lists. I am currently on a list for part time daycare for when school starts and I heard that getting daycare vouchers can take up to a year. \n\nI could tell my mom but I don\u2019t want her being upset with me or with my bf because he is the father of my child.",

That might help. \n\nAs for your mum being upset, maybe your boyfriend needs someone to have a \u201ccome to Jesus\u201d talk with him and straighten him out. Because it seems that what you\u2019ve been doing hasn\u2019t been working as well. \n\nBest of luck to you.",

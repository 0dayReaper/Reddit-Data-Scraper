    "postText": "hi.\r  \n\r  \nMe (24M) and my GF (25F) Has been dating for 5 years (5 year anniversary was a week ago)\r  \n\r  \nA month and a half prior, she had told me she had fallen out of love with me, and emotionally checked out of our relationship. This is all very surprising to me, as we've been fairly good for the past 4 years\r  \n\r  \nFor myself, i viewed our relationship as wonderful, we had arguments here and there but overall the whole thing was good, we've talked about adult stuff like buying a house/getting married sometime soon etc.\r  \n\r  \nOne random day, she decided to just tell me she had fallen out of love with me, she's also mentally checked out of this relationship, i am at a lost on what to do. She told me it has been results of multiple little issues with our relationship, but it was surprising to me as i never knew we had these issues.\r  \n\r  \nShe's been romantically unavailable as of recently, barely anymore goodnight / love you messages, barely have had sex in a while ( we use to 1-2 times a week). And she also said she doesn't see a future in me as well, even though i have no idea why.\r  \n\r  \nWe've been maturely talking, a lot, so far all we've identified is that she needs to communicate her feelings, and i said i didn't want her to bottle up her feelings and just dumped it all like so.\r  \n\r  \nI have a feeling its more than just our relationship, she's started this new role (Area Manager) at her work which is pretty stressful and time consuming (driving to multiple stores across our state), she's been finishing work a lot later as she's got more work to do. I believe this somehow ties to the issue at hand.\r  \n\r  \nAt the start of 2023, is when we both started our fulltime roles, i can honestly admit we've spent alot less time together, feeling more stressed from work and sometimes even taking it out on each other which is very unhealthy (we've identified this).\r  \n\r  \nWhen we talk, i tell her i want to fix our relationship, i told her lets do it together, but she says she emotionally not there anymore, she just wants to leave without any fixing, I tell her that this isn't fair, am i in the wrong for saying that? She told me that it's not fair on her either, that if i want us to try and work together to fix our relationship, it'll just be me getting what i want and her not getting what she wants.\r  \n\r  \nI really dont want to break up, especially like so, I'll feel so lost and breaking up like this won't give me closure, it'll just make me wonder on what I've done wrong, I'll never get closure\r  \n\r  \nI really love this girl, we're both our first boyfriend/girlfriend, both our first everything.\r  \n\r  \nLately I've been trying to do things such as going out on more dates etc, to hopefully bring the spark back into our relationship, hopefully that'll get us back to normal again, surprisingly she somewhat agrees a little bit to do this. However, we're both fulltime workers so we barely have time for each other, barely any time on the weekends as we use that time to relax or do house chores.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nAnd no, she's not cheating on me :(\r  \n\r  \nWhat do i do?\r  \nDo i give her space and time?\r  \nDo we go on a break?(I dont like going on breaks, it doesn't help fix the issue i believe)\r  \nDo i just agree with her wishes and break up? :(",

The spark is gone (on her end) you can\u2019t force it to come back especially when someone has told you she\u2019s checked out! You\u2019re not listening to what she wants and she wants to be alone and you should too. You guys haven\u2019t seen what else is out there so I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what she\u2019s feeling as well.  End it already and stop trying to force this dead relationship on her.",

    "postText": "I know cheating is a no go and there's no justification when it comes to it, but hear me out. I met this girl through one of my classes, she's a really sweet, considerate, kind, and loving person. I knew from the start that she's already taken but I still talked to her knowing I don't have a chance, I did it just to befriend her. As time passed by, we were talking nonstop all day everyday. After some time, she started sharing her life stories, everything from her like she already trusts me maybe because I am a really good listener. \n\nOne of these stories were about her relationship with her current boyfriend (27m). He basically groomed her at the age of 16, and when they had a relationship, he was disrespecting, abusing, controlling, comparing,\u00a0 manipulative to her for 5 years, intensely damaging her mental health and self esteem. She can't leave him as both of their families are already associated with one another. Even her siblings and friends are aware of how he isn't appreciative of everything and everyone around him, utterly disgusted by how he is around her and disliked by everyone. \n\nNow for the past months, I have shown her how she should be treated and loved because everything I did was surprising for her because she never received this kind of genuine love, as she said, from anyone else but me. I always remind her that I'm here for her anytime, that I'll be there when times are rough, that I'll wait for her for as long it takes. \n\nShe and I love each other, we both know it. However, she insists that I let her go because she really feels guilty as she's aware that she's cheating. Her boyfriend, however, did not change for the better, he is still disrespecting, using, controlling, manipulative to her as he sees fit. And whenever he shows a fraction of 'kindness' to her, she feels the need to fix what they have just so she does not feel as bad because of cheating with me. I love her deeply and she does too, she wants to be with me to the point where she says she wants me to free her from her situation, but she's having a hard time because she can't break up with him for now because life will literally turn upside down for her due to her situation, as well as the families concerned. I don't want to let her go because we both know that it'll be damaging to her if they still continue what they have, but she have no choice but to tolerate. \n\nI am determined to stay and wait for her. At this point, I just want to make her happy the way she wants to be with me. I have no clue what to do from now on. I am in dire need of any thoughts that come to your minds. How can I convince her to make me stay with her?",

If either of you had any decency, you wouldn't be messing around with somebody taken and she would've broken up with him, not cheat. Any future you wish together is already doomed. And it sounds like you're just a side piece. Not someone they want to settle with. You really think she'll ditch him like that? If she was going to she already would have. And why would you want to share a woman with another man? There's thousands of single women out there. Do you get off on this sloppy seconds shit or something? Lastly, she's damaged goods.(emotionally and mentally) This won't end well for you.",

This is something she has to do herself and she hasn't even chosen to do that yet.  When she does, I very much doubt she will come running to you.  More likely she will need to spend time figuring herself out and then the chances are slim you will be part of the picture...if she ever leaves him.\n\nThis will hurt, but it's better you do it now than later.  Walk away.  Take time to mourn and then move on.  You are worth more than being the comfort for a woman that can't leave an abuser behind.  Don't be someone that one uses to escape.  Be the one that one wants to run to because you are the only thing they want.\n\nYou really deserve better than this, don't forget that.",

She doesn't want to be a cheater, and no matter what you think of her partner, he is who she chose to be with. To make any further moves to be with or near her would be disrespecting her decision and her.",

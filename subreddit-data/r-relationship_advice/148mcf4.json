    "postText": "I recently upped my medication (Zoloft), and while I\u2019ve always had issues with finishing while on it, they\u2019ve never been this bad. It\u2019s gotten to the point I can\u2019t even finish myself off.\n\nOur relationship is fairly new so he has no reference for how it was before and just thinks he doesn\u2019t turn me on enough or he is just not good at sex.\n\nI definitely find him attractive and he turns me on as much as I think I\u2019m capable of right now. He\u2019s aware of my medications and understands it\u2019s not his fault, but can\u2019t shake the feeling it\u2019s him.\n\nHow can I show him I find him attractive and that he\u2019s good enough for me sexually when my libido is working against me?\n\nEdit: Just wanted to add a couple things that keep coming up!\n\nI\u2019ve already reached out to my doctor! Waiting for a response since he\u2019s out of office until next week, unfortunately.\n\nI\u2019m aware I made some stupid comments (see below). I\u2019ve talked to him about this already and would appreciate advice on the main questions\u2026\n\nHe\u2019s aware of my meds and their effects, he\u2019s been super understanding through all of this.\n\nI\u2019ve asked him what I could do to help him feel better about this and he was a little stumped on solutions as well, so was wondering if anyone else had anything that helped them in a similar situation.",

I had to sit down and say explicitly that I knew this could be a side effect of the med (I also told him this before starting it so he wasn\u2019t blind sided, was waiting for a verdict on an appropriate timeline, get more comfortable agreeing with me and understood where the conversation was going, as I also did say that if I experienced this side effect I would not stay on a medicine that is negatively impacting an important contributor to both his and my quality of life). And I made sure he knew that I don\u2019t have doubt that this is because of the med, because I still found him incredibly attractive, felt desire for him, and had sexual drive both in general and sparked by my desire to be intimate with specifically him. I explicitly told him that it is not about him, I\u2019m not satisfied either, and that in the mean time I truly enjoy helping him out and doing stuff together, and that I have the soonest appointment I could get to initiate a transition to a med without this side effect that unfortunately affects both of us. Being open from start to finish made the whole thing very predictable and also easier for him to understand.",

I'm single now, and not necessarily the most sexually motivated person, but at the time I was prescribed the zoloft I was in a relationship and was sexually active. The sexual side effects were minimal, both in intensity and duration, and the overall benefits to my mood far outweighed any side effects, even before they went away altogether. \n\nI no longer take it, or any other medication for mood, since ultimately through intense therapy I confronted my issues and processed them, and also learned coping skills to deal with the issues that plague(d) me, but at the time all of that seemed impossible before I was put on zoloft. It wasn't the first SSRI I was prescribed either, but it obviously helped me immensely.",

While it definitely altered my libido, I think it's a lot less common for it to get to a point where a man can't finish, in my case on the worst part of the treatment, I could still finish, it just wasn't that fullfiling of a situation like it should be.  \nI'm saying that because I think it's important for you, as a woman, to understand that it's perfectly normal for women to be more affected by libido-altering medication than men.  \nAlso, the idea that you're not enough for a woman in bed can be very difficult for a man, I think it's important to treat this as you would treat some sympton of a disease, tell him how it's frustrating that it seems impossible to finish even yourself off and update him on how you're trying to address this issue with the doctor, so he can see it's not a sex issue but a very common medication issue.  \nAnd I see you already have an appointment to talk to your doctor about this, which is good, sometimes it can take a while to adjust to a comfortable dose (I ranged from 12.5mg to 125mg and turned out 75mg was the sweet spot for me) and in some cases you might take some additional medication to help lessen some side effects.",

You can't undo the damage that has done but if you can grow from it then that is a silver lining in a sense. \n\nIn the end though he has to really come to terms with the impact of the medications. If he can't then even if you hadn't said the jokes he'd still be in his own head. In that sense it is a lack of real empathy for you he is demonstrating and that is disappointing as well.",

            "comment": "I was prescribed Zoloft for the first time when I was 19 and had no lidido the entire time. I tried some other things but all of them were so much worse. I ended up on a low dose of Zoloft, Lexapro, and Wellbutrin. I ended up getting my libido back but things really, really exploded after I got off of hormonal birth control. I'm trying to get off of my anti-depressants  now because it's been so long (I'm 27) and I don't want to be on pharmaceuticals forever, especially because I'd like to have a baby at some point in the future and I don't think all of those have been studied for prenatal safety. But, having a lower dose of Wellbutrin is making the ratio of chemicals in my brain be super serotonin focused again which is impacting my libido a bit. The book Vagina by Naomi Wolf has a lot of really interesting information on dopamine and how it impacts the female brain and orgasm. Serotonin (what the SSRIs increase) can make our libidos decrease.  Wellbutrin often can help with the sexual side effects but has it's own side effects that may or may not impact you. I know this isn't really answering your question but I always like hearing other women's experiences with things I'm experiencing as well. Sending love and wishing you lots of orgasms in the future \u2665\ufe0f\u2728",

While men struggle to get it up, women struggle with finishing sometimes, since it requires a level of comfortability to let yourself go.\n\nThere\u2019s lots of reasons, and if you\u2019re dealing with this with your partner, I\u2019d just talk to them about it. Libido can also decrease if you\u2019re dealing with depression, anxiety, or general stress, regardless of medications.",

I might be wrong, be the boy is drowned in porn pics for several years now. In porn, guys give an orgasm to their partner everytime they fuck. You mention you both are kinda inexperienced, porn might be his only reference.\n\nHe NEEDS to understand everything he sees when it comes to porn is fake. That is something you understand as you got older, but as a young inexperienced man, that's pretty much the only knowledge we can refer to to compare our \"performances\" and \"skills\". And it's still harder on him if, like you said, \"he can't shake the feeling it's on him\". This boy thoughts are going 300kmh full speed because he can not understand why what has always worked on every girl he saw being fucked, suddenly, does not work when it's tried with his dick.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck to both of you sis !",

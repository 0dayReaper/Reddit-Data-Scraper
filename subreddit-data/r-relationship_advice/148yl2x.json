    "postText": "My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 1/2 years. From the beginning, he developed a habit of snooping through my phone while I'm next to him. It started off with him wanting to go through my pictures to \"send himself a selfie.\" I told him I can just go through the photos and send some to him, but he insisted on doing it himself. He went through all my photos up until 2018 (despite it being early 2021). The second time he tried to snoop, I stopped him when he wanted to see my hidden photos, explaining that it was an invasion of my privacy. He stopped.\n\nFast forward to 2022 when we moved in together. The snooping resumed. He would come home from work, find my phone unoccupied on the bed, and start going through my notifications/messages/pictures. On another occasion, I showed him a video where couples checked each other's Instagram messages, and he immediately went through mine. He did stuff like this a handful of times, and never found anything suspicious. I finally spoke to him about the snooping and asked why he kept doing it. He claimed he's just joking and that he wanted to see my reaction. He promised to stop. However it continued secretly, leaving evidence like the \"History\" tab showing on my phone once I open it up or no notifications appearing on the lock screen when I received some.\n\nWhile this was going on, our relationship started to go downhill. He started gaming a LOT and prioritized it over our relationship, despite me continuously communicating my needs and addressing the issue, such as asking if he was depressed, suggesting gaming together or going on more dates, but nothing changed. Moreover, he repeatedly broke promises and continued to do things that I've communicated bothered me (like looking at his phone while I'm going down on him - I thought he was recording me, he tells me he was just looking at notifications). It took a toll on my mental health, and I started contemplating breaking up.\n\nSo, 6 weeks ago, my friend was going through a breakup, and I offered advice based on my own situation, discussing my boyfriend's lies and how one lie led to another. I also told him that I'm considering breaking up with him due to all of this.\n\nAlso, within the past month, my boyfriend started to become more secretive about his online activities - whispering on the phone, or never mentioning that he was talking on the phone with someone else. Usually, that someone else is another girl. When confronted, he admitted to being secretive because he thought that I wouldn't be okay with gaming/talking to other girls but promised to be more open. And I told him, I don't mind if he games with other girls, just as long as he considers me to be a priority.\n\nToday, I asked my boyfriend to use my phone to reply to a grocery delivery person on my behalf while I was in a meeting. When the meeting ended, he came into the room with a disgusted look and accused me of planning to break up with him, having read my messages. We had another conversation - honestly, he didn't seem surprised by this. I told him that my biggest concern in this relationship was the fact that he felt the need to continue doing something he thinks would upset me. He claimed it was to avoid arguments and didn't consider them a big concern since he had no bad intentions. He apologized for going through my phone - he said he went through it because sometimes I get random messages from guys and wanted to see if I got any new ones (even though I ALWAYS tell him about these messages) - and promised to change once again, saying this was his \"wake up call\".\n\nDespite this morning's talk, I still feel violated and distressed, unsure of how to shake off these emotions. I was wondering what should I tell my boyfriend regarding this? Why do I feel this way?  \n\ntl;dr - boyfriend has a pattern of not respecting boundaries when it comes to my phone, despite me never cheating on him. Other issues had escalated once we moved in with each other last year, and nothing had changed even after I spoke to him about these issues. This lead to me thinking about breaking up with him, which I spoke to a friend about. Today, I gave him my phone to help out with grocery shopping, not thinking he'd snoop through my phone. And yet he did, and saw the breaking up texts. We had a conversation about resolutions, but I feel very down and violated, and just need some advice.",

Someone whose words cannot be trusted. Still you insist on trusting his words. Why do you think he will change? People don't change suddenly. There is no switch they can turn off suddenly. He is just going to be more stealthy now.",

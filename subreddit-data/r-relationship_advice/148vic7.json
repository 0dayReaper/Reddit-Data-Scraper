    "postText": "My boyfriend of 3 years has a decreased sex drive after the baby was born. \n\nLet me start by saying that he has always had a lower sex drive than me. If it was up to me, we would have sex 3 times a week but instead it was 1x every 2 weeks before the baby. He said that it takes him a lot of energy to get it up and he has to be in the right mindset (ie. not stressed out at work, tired, etc). We had been working towards getting better but I always found that the spontaneity and excitement wasn\u2019t there anymore after the first year and it seemed like a chore to him than something he was genuinely enjoying. We had sex only at night before bed on the weekends only. He can\u2019t get into the right mindset any other time of the day. We really and truly are attracted to each other and I feel it. He just has some insecurities about not being able to get it up, and I have been trying to be incredibly sensitive to that. He says it\u2019s not nice to sit there with both of us working so hard masturbating him until he is hard, and that it makes him feel like less of a man. \n\nNow, we have a 3 month old baby and it has been 4 months with sex only once (last week). He mentioned it a couple of times, saying he has even asked his friend when sex goes back to normal. He also asked me if it was his fault that we are not having sex. I said it\u2019s normal to go through a dry spell with a newborn, and that I am here whenever he wants it. \n\nAt this point, I feel sexually frustrated and hurt that he doesn\u2019t want to get intimate with me. I feel less connected to him, yet I long for him at the same time. I am still very much attracted to him, but it sucks that it\u2019s out of reach for me, even though we are together. \n\nCan I hear your stories of how you have/have not rekindled your sex life with your partner? Looking for a little bit of hope :\u2019(",

There is no shame in needing a bit of oomf to get things back. Have him try some vitamins to help boost it as well, ashwaganda was a big help for my husband. It helps lower stress and increase male libido and virility. \n\nTreat your relationship as brand new. Cause having a baby forever changes things. So, finding out new things and experimenting will help.",

    "postText": "I really really hate conflict. I hate pushing back, and I hate saying no. I used to pride myself on being able to get along with everyone but this has been really hard for me to conquer and I'm really struggling.\n\nThat being said, I have a coworker that really pushes my buttons. I can't tell how much detail I should go into here without getting to wordy.\n\nBasically- we're on different teams that work together. We have different bosses, but we need to create a strong front to promote our company image. Unfortunately, there have been some situations lately that have made me really irritated at them, and frankly lose respect for them. They keep making changes without telling me, and when I confront them about it, their response is, \"well I'm telling you now, so \\*shrugs\\*\"\n\nWe've had a few deals go bad lately, and this newest one is no different. I'm trying to set standard expectations and I keep getting pushback. My boss game me these deadlines. These bullet points I hate pointing out to them are not mine, but an efficient standard my boss has my back on. Their response is, \"I've been doing this for a long time, I know what we can and can't do\", leading me to constant hours rework. Last time we met up, I yelled at them. I told my boss and she said, \"Good. I'm glad you yelled at them. But you can't give up. They need to know this isn't an off-day. This is you, and you're not afraid\"\n\nThat all sounds nice, but even one email sends me over the edge. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I want to crawl into bed and cry. I'm not like this. I don't like conflict.\n\nHow can I hold my ground with a team member with 20+ years more experience than me? Is their hope we can move forward without conflict? Bonus: how can I keep my cool when I meet with them on Thursday?",

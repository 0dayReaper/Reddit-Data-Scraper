    "postText": "[**\\*\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*\\***](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9v8sv/update_dont_want_to_have_a_clickbait_title_wifes/)\n\nSo, wife and I have been together 17 years.  We are still stupid for each other, and she is the absolute love of my life, best friend, confidant, and co-conspirator.  About two years ago she started having joint aches and pains, and some minor swelling in her hands, wrists, ankles, etc.  So off we got to the GP, who gives us a consult to a Rheumatologist.  Come to find out, she has rheumatoid  arthritis, no worries, she starts treatment.  Fast forward to a month ago, when our North Texas weather decided to go full mental, and start changing temps and rain/weather by the hour it seemed.  She woke up after overnight temp changes and thunderstorms, and her hands were HUGE, worse, her small petite fingers looked like sausages.  And even though she had been previously warned about this, had slept in her wedding ring.  So, off to the doctors office....where they had to cut off her ring.  So, now for the bad, our rings were special ordered from Ireland and custom designed, and have words in Gaelic around the exterior of the ring, negating any type of \"repair\", and they were designed and made......17 years ago.  She was absolutely GUTTED.  I assured her we would figure it out, and it wasn't a big deal, but I could tell, to her, it was.\n\nBegin Sherlock Holmes Mode.  I googled until I couldn't google anymore.  I was able to find that the original jeweler had closed up shop 10+ years ago just due to age.  I searched some more.  I finally found his personal Facebook page, and I message him, and wait......and wait......\n\nI finally get a response from his daughter, that she had noticed a pending message on her Da's page, and that he passed away just six months ago.  I express my condolences, and she asks what was the purpose of my inquiry.  I go into this long diatribe about what had happened, etc.  She tells me she understands, and is so sorry about what had happened.\n\nFast forward a couple of weeks.  I get a message on Facebook from an unknown person, until she explains this was the daughter of the jeweler.  She explains that she went through all her dads designs and looked up the approximate dates, and thinks she found the drawings, details, and MOLDS in her dads things, and wanted me to confirm.  She sent pictures, and I confirmed that YES - THOSE ARE OUR RINGS!  She said she would get all of this to us as soon as possible, and asked for our address.\n\nI open my email this morning to find tracking information, and pictures.  OF OUR RINGS.  She went ahead and had her BROTHER, who had taken over her fathers business make our wedding bands again, in her original size, and two extra in two larger sizes in case her condition causes her fingers to swell/change, and mailed them out to us, at no charge.  I asked why they did both as mine was fine, and she said it would not be fair that my wife had to have a new ring, and I was allowed to keep my old one.  She told me we needed to put our original set away, and to enjoy our new wedding bands.  I asked about compensation, and she said she was honored to keep her dads work and spirit alive.\n\nOur \"New\" Wedding Bands will be here Thursday.\n\nTrying to think of romantic way to present her with them as she has NO IDEA any of this took place.\n\n\\*Edit - I rarely keep anything from her, but didn't want to tell her I was trying only for her to be ultimately disappointed.  The absolute hardest thing for me from now until they arrive will be to NOT tell her as we tell each other EVERYTHING.  So now I not only need to figure out HOW to do this, but NOT to spill the beans until then.  (Our friends nicknamed us Mickey and Mallory as well as Marshall and Lilly from \"How I Met Your Mother\", because we literally tell each other everything)\n\n\\*Edit 2 - I thought about taking her to our local favorite restaurant, where I actually proposed to her, she's a nurse (VA Nurse - how we met 18 years ago), and so ALWAYS goes to the bathroom to wash her hands prior to ordering, when I originally proposed, I waited until she got up to wash her hands, dropped her ring in her wine glass, and....\"waited\".....am thinking of a repeat.\n\n\\*Edit 3 - And to those of you saying \"I\" am awesome, not in the slightest.  SHE is my world, she brought two sons to this add water family that were my pleasure to raise, and are now my best friends.  She is the reason I breathe, and supported all of us when I went back to school to achieve my two doctorates to advance my career.  She is my hero.  I wake up every day to earn her all over again.  This was one small thing I was able to do to bring her happiness, her joy is why I have a heartbeat.  And I don't give  a good flying f\\* at a rolling donut if I seem sappy.  If a man isn't allowed to get sappy over his wife, he shouldn't have one.\n\nTL;DR Wife had to have rings cut off due to swelling from arthritis, I went Hardy Boys and found original jeweler, who had passed away, daughter found original molds/order, and recreated rings without my knowledge and mailed them out.  Was seeking advice on how to give her the new wedding bands.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[**\\*\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*\\***](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9v8sv/update_dont_want_to_have_a_clickbait_title_wifes/)",

You really can't buy this kind of good will - it's only earned over years of hard work and dedication to the trade. And of course the kindness of the daughter &amp; son.",

            "comment": "I (M30) was also diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis about a year or two after my wedding, and my original band wouldn't fit anymore. Luckily for me, at the time of my wedding, I couldn't decide what kind of ring I wanted - so while my wife got a beautiful platinum engagement ring, with custom fit wedding band - I bought myself a $9 titanium ring from amazon. \n\nSince then, I've been medicated, and my swelling has gone down. I still can't fit into the titanium ring, so I bought a beautiful white ceramic ring for myself....off amazon...for $11....\n\n...I actually get a lot of compliments on it. ",

You can watch how the clasp works [here](https://youtu.be/IXY8CHVdGRk?t=170). You push a pen into a small hole, which opens the clasp, and then it just opens at a joint opposite. The jeweler took the top of her engagement ring/wedding band, cut it in half at 3 and 9 o clock, and then took the bottom of one of these superfit bands cut at 3 and 9 and welded them together. You cannot even see that they were two rings patched together, and the clasp mechanism works really well for my wife. If (hopefully not!) you ever need the rings redone in the future, I'd definitely recommend this mechanism. Cheers! ",

You're holding this secret for HER. If you say that you'd do anything for your wife, then think of this as putting your money where your mouth is. \n\nSecond, the actual lying part. Now, I'm a pretty good liar. I don't do it often for obvious reasons, but if I *really* wanted to get away with a lie, you would never know. Part of my strategy, personally, is playing a character. Think of it this way: your character doesn't know about the rings. Your character may look a lot like you, sound like you, even have your same name, but he is not you. And he doesn't know about the rings, so neither do you! \n\nHopefully that helps! =]",

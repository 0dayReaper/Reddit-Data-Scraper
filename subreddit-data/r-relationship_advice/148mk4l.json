    "postText": "I have been with my boyfriend for awhile now. I\u2019ve never been the type to care about going through my boyfriends phone, but a few weeks ago I couldn\u2019t fall asleep and so I just decided to. There wasn\u2019t really many sneaky intentions to start out with, and afterwords I came clean about it. I\u2019ve always known that my boyfriend has watched porn, but never really had a big deal with it until now. \n\nA few weeks ago, I caught him in the bathroom connected to our bedroom, door wide open, watching porn and masturbating. This bothered me solely because I was right there. In my mind, he could\u2019ve just asked to have sex or something like that and I would\u2019ve, without question. Now, to go into further detail, we\u2019ve never had a bad sex life. If anything, it\u2019s been nothing but amazing. So when I caught him doing that when I was right there, it threw me off guard and I got visibly upset and verbally upset. \n\nAfter a few days is when I went through his phone. I ended up opening his Safari, and there was Twitter right there, open and already on a video of some woman naked, whatever. I watched it myself, and I just started feeling sick to my stomach. I know I should\u2019ve stopped myself there but i didnt. I went onto his profile and looked at all of the videos and pictures he\u2019d like. After a few minutes I had to stop. There were hundreds of them, 500 to be exact. \n\nAbout a week or two later, I eventually ended up bringing it up to him about how I felt about it and why it bothered me so much. He didn\u2019t understand my perspective and sees things in black and white, his words. He brought up that it was just something all guys do, that it was natural. Eventually, he ended up telling me that he watched them mostly for the sound of women moaning, which didn\u2019t bother me. What bothered me was later seeing that a majority of what he would like were pictures. Not only that, but whenever he would watch them here, there is no way that the sound would be on considering I\u2019ve BEEN there in the same room while he\u2019s watching. When I was on his phone that night on his twitter, I went through his search history and found that he had been on twitter multiple times a day, every single day. Except for my birthday. At that point, on top of that, we would be having sex once a day if not multiple times a day. \n\nDuring our conversation together, he told me that the only solution would be to just stop watching it altogether. At first, I told him no because then he\u2019d feel some type of way towards me about it. But then both came to the conclusion that both of us will feel like shit regardless of what happens, so that he\u2019d just remove the problem. I told him then, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going to stop watching it just to do it behind my back and lie to me about it.\u201d He assured me he wouldn\u2019t. \n\nMy mistake was remembering his twitter username, so the next day while he was at work i went back in looked at it. In fact, I\u2019ve looked at it everyday since it happened. Some if it being me comparing myself to them, or not. The next day when I had looked, everything seemed fine. Then a few hours later I checked again, and he was online actively liking tweets of women naked, having sex, whatever. I wasn\u2019t as upset that he was doing it, just that he lied to me about it. I brought it up to him while he was at work, and he sat there and told me it wasn\u2019t him. Tried to delete the account but said he didn\u2019t know the password to it. Even logged out in front of me. Yet I still have this nagging feeling in my chest.\n\nSince then, there has been little activity. I have screenshots even, which sounds crazy and probably is. But at first it was the decrease in people he was following, but not by a lot. I just chalked it up to people probably deleting their accounts. Then, slowly, he started following more people. Today even I saw one more person that he was following. The thing is, if someone had gotten into his twitter account, why would they be liking porn on his account and just following more of them? Am I just being insecure? I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\n\nTLDR; my boyfriends been lying to me about using twitter to watch porn after he told me he wouldn\u2019t.",

Although a lot of men do watch porn and such, if you guys are in a relationship you should set some boundaries. And if push comes to shove do delete his account. He might make another one but if anything else that pushes along the lines of your boundaries and it makes you that uncomfortable then you know what the option might be. And watching it behind your back is a pretty fucked up thing to do in general. I hope you can resolve this. just try not to overthink it and take a breath.",

I\u00b4m not a genius with relationships but try to have some one on one time to talk it out, because it might lead to you both talking about some vital things. One of you might feel that there is something missing in the relationship. But you could both work to change that, And you might be anxious while waiting for a reply and such, I have had a feeling like this. but its all okay. Whether it goes well or not.",

Set some boundaries so he doesn't feel the need to \"hide\" it from you. \n\nTo be honest, it's perfectly natural to want some alone time to masturbate, regardless of gender/sex. I personally do it to porn that fulfills a fantasy that I would never participate in in real life, the same can be said for my partner.\n\nThe only time you should ever take issue with porn is when the communication breaks down between you both and if it starts to have a negative impact on your relationship e.g. lack/decline of sexual intimacy, he crosses a boundary you both have agreed to etc.\n\nOne last thing, you mentioned you've compared yourself to some of the women he's been looking at - don't; it's not a good path to take. The men and women in professional studios are picture perfect and definitely not representative of the average person, so never start comparing yourself to them. Porn is pure fantasy, hence there being so many different categories - to cater for these needs.\n\nGood luck, have fun and be safe!",

    "postText": "29 Female and 29 Male, in a relationship for 7 years and now engaged. \n\nMe 29F and my fianc\u00e9 29M have been together for 7 years. During this time we have been in medical school and now residency. It\u2019s been a challenging career path especially with the pandemic. \n\nI\u2019m now graduating residency and landed a great job. My family is traveling in from out of town to celebrate. My graduation is on a Saturday at 5 PM and I wanted to have a brunch before hand with my family. A nice intimate moment before the big graduation. \n\nHere\u2019s the dilemma. My fianc\u00e9  has a golf tournament with his surgery residency program that morning. It\u2019s apparently a big moment for the program to bond and celebrate their own residents. It starts at 9 AM and he\u2019s saying he absolutely cannot miss it, and will be unable to attend my graduation brunch. \n\nKeep in mind this golf outing is an annual event that he\u2019s attended in the past and will attend again for the next three years. He promises he\u2019ll be there in time for my graduation (and will catch the end of my brunch if he can). \n\nReddit, am I wrong for being totally frustrated and bummed that he\u2019s prioritizing this golf tournament? We can\u2019t seem to find a compromise, do you have any advice?",

One of those \u201cyou don\u2019t have to go\u201d but by not going you miss out on major bonding, conversations etc",

Does it absolutely have to be a brunch meal before the ceremony? \n\nThere are very easy solutions to be had if you aren't so fixated on that brunch time. You can have an intimate meal with your family and fiance and he doesn't have to jeopardize social connections in his career.",

If he has been planning this a year in advance (since you said he did it last year), then I don't think it's his fault that your graduation was scheduled on the same day. I think someone could record it for him, and you two could probably face time or something so you're both with one another in spirit. I don't think it's fair to ask him to not attend this. Graduations are important, but generally just to the person graduating and maybe their parents. A show of family support is appreciated but never required. It's not like a birthday or anything.",

I wanted to clarify that this won\u2019t be possible given the time constraints of the weekend/when my family is in town. \n\nWe both come from demanding careers, and for a majority of our relationship we have put our careers ahead of our own personal wants and relationship needs. Quite frustrating that this trend continues on.",

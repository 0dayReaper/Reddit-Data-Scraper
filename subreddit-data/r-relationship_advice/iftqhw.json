    "postText": "For some  context, I have a serious medical condition that requires some pretty heavy medication. It does a lot of things, including destroy my sex drive, and knock me out for long periods of time. My husband and I were married before I was diagnosed, and he's supported my through diagnosis and treatment. He's a wonderful man.\n\nWe used to have a very active sex life, and it has been a considerable strain on our marriage that I never feel in the mood. I feel like a terrible wife in this regard, and I miss being able to do what we both enjoy.\n\nTo be clear, when I take my medication, I am dead to the world. You could blast a fire alarm next to me, and I wouldn't wake up. You could pick me up and toss me around, and I might not wake up.\n\nLately I've felt worse than normal. Really sick, dizzy, uncomfortable ect. I went to my doctor, scared I might be sick with COVID, and it turns out I'm pregnant. 5 weeks.  But I haven't had sex with my husband in at least two months. Maybe more. I did not cheat on him. I was not assaulted by anyone, anywhere, that I know of. This was not immaculate conception.\n\nI told my husband and he was surprised. It's probably a million in one chance I got pregnant, due to the medication I'm on, and my condition. He was shocked, then excited, and I was just so relieved he didn't accuse me of cheating that I didn't stop to consider why he didn't.\n\nIt's been a few days. I've been thinking about when I first started taking my medication. It was hard for him to adjust to me not wanting to have sex, and he used to joke that I could just lay there and watch tv while we do it. Or, and here's what makes me scared, he used to joke that he could just have sex with me while I'm sleeping, and that way I don't have to deal with it, and he can be satisfied. He's mentioned this a couple of times, but always lets it drop when I'm not okay with it.\n\nI've started thinking about all the times I woke up in the morning and had uncomfortable pelvic pressure that usually only comes for me after I have sex--my husband likes to be rough and I don't really mind, we were always pretty wild in bed or adventurous. Or bruises I've had that I can't explain.\n\nI confronted my husband about this. About me being scared he did this to me, and at the least why he wasn't surprised the dates don't match up. He was angry I would accuse him of something so horrible, and insists that I'm just misremembering the last time we had sex. The medication does play with my memory sometimes, but I remember the last time we had sex. I remember every time we have sex now because I don't enjoy it.\n\nI don't want to panic. I don't want to talk myself into being convinced he's been having sex with me while I'm asleep, and I don't want to talk myself out of this possibility just to protect our marriage. But I'm terrified. This is the only possibility I can come up with. And if it's true, I don't know what to do. I've been heartbroken for a while over the idea that I wouldn't be able to have kids. Now I'm going to have a baby and I'm so, so happy. But what if this baby happened because of what my husband did?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I think my husband has been having sex with me while I'm asleep because of my low sex drive, and now we have a miracle baby that may be a byproduct of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I just wanna say the response to this has been insane. Thank you so much to everyone. I'm really lost and I don't know what to think or do. I'm going to take some time to think about this, get additional information and resources depending on however this is going to go, and figure it out.  Just to be clear, however, because there are too many responses to answer directly, NO, I have never given permission for my husband to have sex with me while I'm sleeping. YES, I have asked him if I have ever instigated something while asleep, sleep walked, sleep spoke, or did anything in my sleep related to sex, and he answered no we have NEVER had sex outside of a time when I was fully cognizant and aware of what's happening. And YES, I am keeping the baby regardless of what happened. If people are interested, I'll post an update when there is something to write. Again, thank you, thank you for all the support and opinions. They all matter. ",

            "comment": "Have you had a dating ultrasound yet? The first appointments generally use your last period date along with general ovulation dates to determine how far along you are, and then they will do an ultrasound to see what stage the fetal growth is at to confirm.\n\nBecause 5 weeks and 7-8 weeks (with your estimate of 2 months), I just wonder if perhaps you're a little further along? I don't want you to doubt yourself,  but a couple weeks is not a lot to be off by... \n\nI also would talk to your dr to figure out your memory lapses, because sex a week or two later and remembering it a little off could be possible.\n\nBut listen to your gut, you know you and you know your husband. Cover all of your bases until you feel safe.",

I was told I was 7 weeks and then when we went to the ultrasound, i was so early that there wasnt anything to see, so about 4 weeks. It can happen the other way too. \n\nYou should be due for a scan soon and that'll give you more answers. As for all the other stuff like the pain you've been feeling, I cant explain that. Maybe put a camera in your room?",

But in hopes that there is nothing so horrible going on, when was the last time you remember having sex?  At 5 weeks (that count starts from LMP, at least in my country), you\u2019d most likely be just starting to feel symptoms. Where as if it was 5 weeks past conception, you\u2019d expect symptoms. And 5 weeks past conception could mean that the baby making sex happened close to 6 weeks prior whereas 5 weeks pregnant (here) means the baby making sex happened somewhere in the 4-2 weeks ago range. It\u2019s pretty inexact unless you know exactly when you ovulated. If you have irregular cycles, the dates could vary even more. \n\nThis is definitely something you should discuss in private with your ob/gyn and there\u2019s plenty of info on how to make that possible without making your husband suspicious.",

She also used to light the fireplace, smoke cigarettes, and once drove the manual transmission car out into a field to walk the dog. One morning she woke up with shoes and socks on but no underwear, and we never found the missing pair, not even in the bin-- leading us to believe she either burned them or went for a night time walk and dumped them in the street somewhere.\n\nMy boyfriend has full conversations with me sometimes, and he frequently tries to initiate sex while he's dead asleep.\n\nOP, it sounds to me like your husband has been assaulting you in your sleep, but don't rule out the possibility that you've actually been doing things yourself.",

He never choked me before, he\u2019s a \u201cgentle giant\u201d (his words), so I was really turned on... until his hand wouldn\u2019t stop getting tighter.

If both parties are engaging it suggests both are concious enough for consent, then consent is assumed. So unless she was truly dead to the world asleep and her husband went for anyway, then nothing is that concerning. \n\nIf she WAS though, that is a serious violation and the fact that she's considering it a possibility is itself concerning",

It is a calculation based on average time of conception and gestation for most women; it is not a specific amount of weeks counted from the date of conception. Because of how pregnancy is calculated, it can be up to two weeks off of your actual conception date. The formula is based on your last period and an average ovulation date of 15 days later. If you have irregular periods, ovulate early or late, or conceive on another date, it is still calculated this way. If you know your specific conception date, it is still calculated this way. \n\nI wanted to make sure you have this information, as its not commonly discussed and is super confusing, and may affect your calculations of when conception happened. But it doesn't change that you should consider going somewhere safe, getting counseling, and exploring all possibilities to ensure your safety is the utmost priority.",

There is a good chance she conceived her child when she last remembers having sex with her husband. Sperm can also live in the vagina for up to 5 days after intercourse which can also make determining the exact date difficult when were talking weeks. I would recommend OP discuss with her doctor in private the concerns she has to see what the doctor says and if it's a possibly she conceived this child around the last time she remembers having sex.",

            "comment": "A lot of people telling her to trust her gut and listen to her body, which, yes, agreed. BUT the two most worrying clues, which alarmed me too, are pelvic pain and bruising. Pelvic pain is common during early pregnancy. It\u2019s one of the earliest symptoms, so even if it wasn\u2019t common for her before, well it\u2019s common for her current condition. According to WHO, women have high rates of anemia (over 30% compared to 12% of men), which makes bruising very easy. I constantly have bruises and have no idea where they came from. My ex-boyfriend used to insinuate I was cheating because how else would I be getting all these bruises I couldn\u2019t explain? It just wasnt in his frame of reference that a person can bruise without something painful and memorable happening to them because that\u2019s never happened to him. \n\nWell, you know who has even higher rates of anemia than a woman like me...A PREGNANT WOMAN. Nearly 42% of them. A lot of women develop conditions that lowers platelet counts, which again, makes bruising much easier and more frequent. \n\nI\u2019m not saying to discount anything OP is saying, but it\u2019s kind of hard to read a bunch of people telling a woman in an incredibly emotionally vulnerable situation, that she has absolutely been raped by the man she loves. There are so many questions that need to be asked and explanations that need to be explored before anybody just flippantly throws out accusations that will destroy 3 lives. Most people use this as a sounding board, \u201cmy boyfriend did x, and I feel y, but should I feel that way?\u201d She wants to process it, she wants to talk to different people who may have different views and experiences and make her see or think about things differently. Nobody has the right answer and it\u2019s downright cruel to present your uninformed opinion as the only correct conclusion. \n\nThe people going further than telling her she\u2019s definitely been raped and that she shouldn\u2019t keep her rapist\u2019s baby...you do realize this is a real person and not just some story on the internet that you can use for your performative outrage. It\u2019s easy when you don\u2019t know or care about the person, and it\u2019s just some stranger on the internet, but the person reading this might start to believe you when you convincingly tell her you know she\u2019s been raped. You are lying when you state it is rape as a fact, because you know that YOU DO NOT KNOW with certainty what the true reason is. Worse still, you\u2019re using that lie to influence the OP\u2019s perceptions, if a few people told me a sexual encounter I had was rape, I\u2019d start to color it differently in my head too. I\u2019d start to look for other signs too. How could you not? You\u2019re not trying to help her and please sit with what really prompts you to respond in this way to a woman asking for help in a very unclear, hazy, nuanced situation, where we also know that we do not have all the information to make conclusions. These responses are just as bad as telling her it\u2019s in her head, she\u2019s not remembering correctly or that she\u2019s wrong for even questioning whether her husband raped her. \n\nIf I came to my friends, distraught and confused, and told them this exact story, there\u2019s no way they\u2019d say \u201csorry girl you were raped and that\u2019s your rapists baby.\u201d They would ask me questions, let me talk, let me process, wrestle through each plausible explanation with me, while also making sure I\u2019m safe and getting me the help I need. We should treat anybody, internet stranger or sister, in exactly the same way. I can\u2019t imagine how she\u2019s feeling having to wrestle with these thoughts and then further doubting her own memory, perceptions and basically her entire reality as the conclusion you\u2019re quick to throw out would mean her entire relationship with her husband is a lie.

I also think you should consider staying with a friend or family member if possible while you wait for that appointment; **definitely do not attend a doctor's appointment with him.** Others have suggested confronting him again, but **if he did rape you, confronting him a second time (especially after he was so angry before) is not a safe idea.** I understand that leaving to stay with a friend or family member for awhile could have a very negative impact on your marriage if he didn't rape you, but if he did rape you, it's better to be safe and away from him.\n\nI also hope the \"my husband likes to be rough and I don't *really* mind\" was just written in a slightly off manner and that rough sex with your husband has always been fully consensual and you haven't made yourself participate if you don't really want to.\n\nOthers have also suggested setting up a hidden camera. Which could of course answer your question, but if he is raping you, then setting up a camera and remaining in the home could result in you being raped again and/or him discovering it and escalating any abuse. Ultimately it is your choice whether you go that route with a camera, but please be aware of the potential risks. I think this is a situation in which it is far safer for you to talk with a doctor and if worst comes to worst, a domestic violence advocate.\n\nNo one here can know for certain what happened, but at the very least please put together a safety plan if you choose to remain in the home with him. [The National Domestic Violence Hotline has a sexual violence safety plan for individuals living with an abusive partner](https://www.thehotline.org/2015/05/28/safety-planning-around-sexual-abuse/).\n\nAlso consider writing out/noting the details, dates, and times of everything (when you visited the doctor first, any dates you can remember in which you woke up with pelvic pressure and bruises, any dates you remember in which he made jokes about raping you) and take injuries of any bruising you currently have, though maybe you don't have any. Keep any documentation in a safe place where he can't find it.\n\nI hope it's an issue with your medication impacting your memory, but keep yourself safe while you wait to talk with a doctor again.\n\nEdit: If he has been raping you, the [National Domestic Violence Hotline offers an amazing and thorough set of pregnancy safety plans](https://www.thehotline.org/is-this-abuse/pregnancy-abuse/) for remaining physically and emotionally safe during pregnancy, planning for a safe childbirth, and during the post-partum period. **If you are being abused, pregnancy is often a time of escalating abuse and can lead an abusive partner to have additional control over you.**",

                    "comment": "Thank you for the advice about going to the doctor. I'm just not sure how to go without him? We're both out of work because of COVID and since he found out I'm pregnant he's hyper aware of everything. I don't mean this to come off in a creepy way, it's just very hard for either of us to do anything without the other knowing. He wants to do everything with me related to the baby, including all doctors appointments--he's very happy and excited. And if I try and go for a reason other than the baby, I think he'll be very suspicious.  I don't want to fight with him until I figure out what's going on.\n\nAs for our sex life, I can say he's never hurt me, that has never happened. And it's all consensual. I just meant I'm not turned on by sex getting a little rough, that's his kink, and since it doesn't both me and he indulges me in other ways, I'm fine with playing along. He doesn't like to slap me or anything (not to kink shame, to each their own), he's just into manhandling a bit. He's just very strong and very athletic, and he likes to utilize that during sex. \n\nI don't have anyone to stay with outside of some friends, but due to COVID I don't want to put them at risk or not socially distance, so I have some options to think about while I stay at home with him.\n\nThank you for all the help you've provided!",

I work in the domestic violence field and we have heard of many survivors finding creative ways to safely leave home, including \"going to get groceries\" or going to a park, picking up meds, going for a long walk, going to help an ill family member, etc. and using all those as pretenses to seek help or medical care. Obviously if you made up an excuse to get groceries you would need to actually get them, and if you made up an excuse to visit a park, for example, you should plan out ahead of time what park it could be and what you \"did\" there.\n\nAlso, telehealth visits are an option as well, though I know in-person is more ideal. You could possibly do a telehealth visit via phone at a park, in your garage, in a private place at a store, etc.\n\nIn addition, what u/globewanderess shared is true. Some clinics and hospitals are only allowing the patient in for appointments and no one else due to COVID.\n\nI am glad as well that your sex life has been fully consensual. I just wasn't sure whether it was something you made yourself engage in or whether he pressured you at all, so thanks for clarifying.\n\nAlso, another resource that may be helpful is this [COVID-19 domestic violence safety plan put together by survivors, for survivors](https://sanctuaryforfamilies.org/safety-planning-covid19/) specific to safety planning strategies during a pandemic.\n\nGood luck!",

I mean, the idea is creepy, but he never sounded creepy or sinister or anything like that. It was always playful and with laughter. He never made me feel outright uncomfortable and I thought we were just joking. \n\nWhen I confronted him it didn't seem like he was attempting to gaslight me about the dates not matching up. He seemed sure I was misremembering because of my medication, but I absolutely know we did not have sex 5 weeks ago. At least sex I participated in.",

You said in your post \u201cwhat my husband did\u201d. \nThe pelvic discomfort may have come from sleeping through needing to urinate for too long. The pregnancy may be further along than anticipated. At five weeks you likely havnt had a confirmation scan, just a blood test. The hcg levels in your blood drop the further you get along in pregnancy, so bloods aren\u2019t always accurate. You may also have had sex in your sleep where you presented as being fully alert to your husband and were not actually awake. \nThis is a pretty big thing to accuse someone of. I\u2019m 100 per cent not victim blaming but there are so many variables here that could mean he is completely innocent and you might destroy your marriage by accusing him. \nPerhaps set up a secret camera to record. Chances are if he has done this terrible thing, then he will do it again and you will see it on camera. You may also need to prepare yourself that you are doing things as well without knowing and that\u2019s a whole brain bend on its own. \nCheck in with your doctor regularly as your medications may also affect the foetus. Insist on dating and welfare/monitoring scans for the foetus. \nSource- Am a nurse who used to work in a fertility clinic. We got many people through the doors who were well further along than anticipated because they went for bloods and not scans. Also, ex husband was on a sleeping med and he got up and drove, cooked, had sex all while fully asleep and had no memory of it.",

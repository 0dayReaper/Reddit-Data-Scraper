    "postText": "\nbeen thinking about breaking up with my girlfriend, we were together for ~ a year. I initially broke up with her because shes a more anxious type and codependent as im more independent and greatly value my alone time. initially we got along great even though we dont have much in common, spent alot of time together, and shes a incredibly caring and understanding person.\n\ntowards the end of the initial relationship i started to feel less like myself (i struggle with depression and have ADHD) i started spending more time engaging in my hobbies and talking to my friends. Not because I wanted to get away from gf but because i missed those parts of my life as they weren\u2019t frequently happening. \n\ngf is a grinder (school or work) and didnt really have hobbies or friends. it was work, school, and spend time with me. \n\ni tried to push gf to (put it bluntly) get more of her own life and explore things like games, shows, books and make friends.\nwe started to disconnect at this point so i ended things.\n\nAfter a few months we ran into each other at a party and one thing led to another, we both said we still have love for the other and are giving another shot.\n\nWhile now she has made friends, and is starting to push herself to find her own interests, i am feeling like our lack of common interests / we arnt compatible personalities are really showing themselves.\n\nTLDR - idk how to feel about my relationship, love them but have nothing in common.\nI am in the wrong/unjustified for feeling we wont work out? no one has ever done anything to wrong the other (like cheat or lie) \njust feeling lost atm - thnx reddit",

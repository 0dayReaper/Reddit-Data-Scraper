    "postText": "She\u2019s been in a 5 years relationship, broke up and 1 month after, we got together. We\u2019re now 7 months into this new relationship and she can\u2019t get over her ex I believe. She also takes me for granted.\n\nShe\u2019s been sick for a week, stayed at my place and I took care of her and in the process she just told me that I don\u2019t feel like home because I don\u2019t know what she likes to eat when she\u2019s sick.\nIn the process she also got issues at work and life overall felt really low to the point where she would wake up crying and asking herself \u2018what am I doing with my life\u2019. As a coping mechanism, she went back to her happy moment in life, which was years ago, with her ex driving along the coast. Even though I\u2019m here, taking care of her.\nShe\u2019s quite honest and said that she feels low about ending the previous relationship and she\u2019s not over it yet. Mentioned that she had life planned and everything was perfect until she was forced to move to another country and do long distance until she decided that she\u2019s the only one compromising and decided to end the previous relationship. She also mentioned that she didn\u2019t end it because of lack of feelings but because it was not serving her needs. I also heard a lot of \u2018he would always calm me down when I was low\u2019 or \u2018he was over confident and that helped me a lot\u2019 or \u2018I expect from a 6 months relationship what I had after a 4 years relationship\u2019.\n\nThis morning we woke up, had a quick chat and she stayed in bed talking to her mother and explaining why she feels low and just spent 30 minutes talking about the good parts of the previous relationship and complaining about \u2018why didn\u2019t he want to marry me\u2019 or \u2018why didn\u2019t he want to tell his parents about me\u2019 or \u2018why didn\u2019t he try to keep me when I had to move abroad\u2019 or \u2018why isn\u2019t he saying that today\u2019. I think I\u2019m right to be upset by her doing that. She\u2019s in my bed, talking about her ex and kind of missing him. \nThis is not fair, I get that she\u2019s low and life sucks but this hurts me and I think it would hurt anyone. I came to the table completely healed from the past, didn\u2019t mention my ex once, was all open to give this the best shot.\n\nAlso fair to say that we are of different backgrounds and cultures and her ex was the same nationality which for her is a big thing because she wants to connect families and on my side there would be a language barrier.\n\nI think I\u2019m under reacting to this and had too much patience. How would you react?",

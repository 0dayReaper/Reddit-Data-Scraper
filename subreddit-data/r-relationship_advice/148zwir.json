    "postText": "Pretty much the title. We've been together for over a year, but more and more lately I just feel restless. She hasn't done anything wrong, and I still care about her deeply as a person. I don't ever want to hurt her, but I'm feeling a little trapped by the relationship, and that feeling is growing. As much as I hate this phrase, I love her, but maybe I'm not in love with her.\n\nI know that there's not much you guys can tell me from that little bit of information. I guess I just want to know if I'm being an asshole for even thinking about it. Maybe the whole feeling of not being \"in love\" is a passing thing?",

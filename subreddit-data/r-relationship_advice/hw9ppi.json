Just wanted to go ahead and post and let y\u2019all know I\u2019m okay. \n \nUpdate 2: Here was the post that got removed\n\nHoly shit, y\u2019all. \nI haven\u2019t been on reddit since I posted my original here and I did NOT expect this. I had to make an extra account with similar name to post because of the 48 hour thing, but I know a lot of people were genuinely worried about me so I wanted to go ahead and post an update (sorry if that\u2019s not allowed). \n\nThank you guys so much, I can\u2019t even believe the support/response I got. I ended up calling my brother and telling him about it and asking him how I should handle it, and he got in his car to come get me before I even finished telling him what all had happened. Him freaking out more than anything else made me realize that I wasn\u2019t overreacting. I didn\u2019t tell my boyfriend I was leaving until my brother was parked on the street and I just walked out with a few things. So now I\u2019m in a messy breakup situation where he\u2019s already tried to come by my moms house even though I told him I didn\u2019t want to see him and that I\u2019d get my stuff eventually, both from his parents house where he\u2019s currently at and his actual house. Things are gonna be weird to figure out but I just wanted to let you guys know that I\u2019m totally okay, thank you. I can\u2019t reply to everyone who reached out/messaged so I hope you guys see this and know I appreciate it.\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\nMonday we decided to make the 8ish hour drive back to our home state and quarantine there instead for a few months. Right before leaving, we got into a big fight because I wanted to stay at my mothers house for a while, he doesn\u2019t want me to, among other things I won\u2019t get into. Well, before leaving we decided to eat dinner so we didn\u2019t have to stop anywhere. \n\nFast forward to our drive and not long after hitting the road I passed out. Don\u2019t even really remember falling asleep. Woke up one time for a while, drank some Gatorade *which he gave me*, and then I fell asleep again. I thought this was extremely weird because I wasn\u2019t tired hardly at all and we didn\u2019t even leave super early. I kept commenting on how weird it was that I was tired the whole drive and slept 90% of it. \n\nYesterday the tension eased a bit and he made the offhanded comment that he wishes he could drug me more when I \u201cact out\u201d and argue with him. I ask him what he\u2019s talking about. Proceeds to tell me he put Benadryl in my drink and that\u2019s why I slept, so he didn\u2019t have to deal with me. He literally said this as though it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal! I\u2019m still reeling from the conversation and completely floored. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m overreacting or not but something tells me I\u2019m not, and it\u2019s extremely fucked up to put medicine in drinks. I don\u2019t know what to do",

So i wasn't that interested in them.  He would press for me to finish the drink.  I didn't understand. Then i noticed stuff floating on the top and residue in the bottom.   Asked about it he would say,  oh must be the ice maker needs to be cleaned.  \nI found out he was crushing ambien and other sleeping pills and adding it to my drinks.   And yes,  that made me more compliant in all the ways he wanted.  \nI figured it out.  Didn't try to get proof or call the police.   I just got out.  I often regret that i didn't try to document it and press charges but at least i got out alive.  \n\nPlease,  don't stay with this man!",

Benadryl, drug name diphenhydramine hydrochloride, is of course popular and generally safe, but as with anything it has side effects and when overdose you\u2019re at risk for heart trouble, seizures, coma, and death.   If he hit you in the head twice to render you unconscious you would immediately see that as a crime.  Well this is every bit as bad, maybe even creepier.  He drugged you!  That\u2019s Bill Rapist Cosby stuff!  It\u2019s what many a serial killer did to a victim.\n \nI know I wasn\u2019t the best boyfriend to more than my share of women, but dead God, drugging a woman unconscious??  I\u2019ll admit that arguing on a long car trip trapped during this pandemic would be rough, but man, we would either take turns picking music or just look at the scenery.\n\nFind out right now about your state\u2019s laws about recording a conversation with or without all parties consenting.  Or try to get him to text you.  Say something simple like, \u201cThat was some sleep, deep but different.  How many Benadryl did it take?  How did you figure out the right dose?  I guess I didn\u2019t even notice it in the Gatorade, was that how I took it?  If I ever have insomnia I might mix something up like that? Did I look cute or was I slobbering with my jaw dropped? Big turn off or ...?\u201d   \n\nSome druggists just enjoy the power and the secrecy.  For others it is just a tool to do other things, think guys who roofie girls.\n\n\nPLEASE don\u2019t let him skate on this but please be careful.",

She's possibly more sensitive to Benadryl than most, but he must have given her an absolutely massive dose and when she's in a safe place she should see a doctor to make sure she doesn't have any liver or kidney issues as as a result of this poisoning. \n\nPlease take care, OP, and get away from this monster. If Uber or Lyft are available in your area you may be able to get one to drive you to your mom's as some drivers do drive long distances and even across state lines. But please wait until he's out of the house so you can make a clean get away.\n\n(I do have a much higher tolerance for medication than most so I'm not necessarily the best person to measure a \"normal\" reaction against)\n\nEditing to add: the people who commented that Benadryl easily knocks them out blows my mind. A recommended dose doesn\u2019t do a thing for me. I really am outside the norm when it comes to processing meds. And, OP, if you see this please get away from this man.

You might need to get a long distance calling card, or have someone buy one and give you the calling codes. \n\n-Places that help w job hunting (social assistance offices, libraries, YMCAs) often have phones available and sometimes offer drop-in hours w free computer use. Check if they're open re covid.\n\n-Look into services near you or your mom for people in coercive, controlling, or abusive relationships. They have lots of resources and often have counselors. Many would pass on a message to your mom for you or might help connect you in a 3 way.\n\n\nFor privacy with your own phone: \n\n-Ask your mom to call you routinely, instead of you calling her. Your bf might feel less able to cause issues over your mom calling you, versus you calling her.\n If your bf creates problems about talking with your mom -- beside moving on making a plan to leave, bc that's another behavior that skews power toward what he wants and away from what you want --, you can reduce talk time by asking for routine calls from a trusted friend (aka someone takes you seriously, do what you ask, not escalate the situation, and/or will pass messages to your mom). \n\nIf you're in close quarters, try to talk with your mom/friend once in private and say what's going on, or that you'd like to talk privately, away from your bf who's always around. Pick an ongoing problem for them to call about that you can actually talk about (e.g. something worrying them or happening with a close family member). When the call comes in, get the conversation on a roll, and take a walk outside to share what you need. If you're very worried about your bf, sandwich the private conversation inside the other conversation, which will help in trying to act normally during and after. Bonus if the conversation is something that bores or lightly annoys your boyfriend, bc he might ask you to take it somewhere else. \n\n-If you're concerned that info tracking apps could be on your phone or laptop, nothing you use them for is private, including looking up ways to check for apps on. Be aware that many apps allow info to be accessed by another phone or computer, and don't require physical access to the tracked phone. If your bf tends to get upset about your communication with others but not about your phone conversations or texts, I'd consider that a flag.\n\n-Some car and phone GPSes show where you've been even if you're not using them. If you're concerned, do private things in places where you can realistically spend a lot of solo time, so you don't have to deal with the stress/risk of being monitored or lying. \nGood places can include malls, tourist areas, or stores where merchandise changes quickly or is meant to be heavily browsed, like book/comic shops, make-up places, or secondhand stores. Libraries are usually good for magazines and newspapers, as well as books, internet, and payphones, and you can use not having a card as a reason to hang out there. (If a card is actually needed to access the internet, many libraries will give you a temporary visitor pass in exchange while holding onto an ID card as collateral). \n\nGood luck. Remember, you can go to your mom's just bc the situation is exhausting - you don't need to feel in danger or that he's being abusive. You can leave bc you feel like that's better for you right now. You can leave without telling him bc his actions are and have stopped you from doing what's best for you right now. \n\nFeel free to head to the convenience store and get picked up to go to your mom's. If you need it, you have the internet's permission to leave without saying anything. You have many great reasons: \n\n-he committed at least one criminal act against you, and he drove around with your unconscious body for hours and felt calmed by it.\n\n-he gets upset when your input is nearly as valuable as his.\n\n-he told you directly with threats that he has plans for you to get less of your way in the future, and for him to not only get more of his way for himself but with yourself too. \n\n-controlling and angry people nearly always escalate sharply when they're about to lose control (often the first appearance of physical violence or, when there has been physical aggression, fatal violence, especially by choking).\n\n You can tell him later, have someone else do it, or not tell him at all (if you do this, call the non-emergency police number where he is and let them know, in case they get a call. Ask them to tell you what they'll say if he calls).\n\nBe careful. Be smart. Give yourself advice you'd give your best friend. Find safety, then rest. \n\nMaybe take that powerade bottle with you.",

            "comment": "  Ok. It seems like you are in a very unhealthy and abusive relationship. What I would recommend, is elaborate a plan to move out of the house and out of his \u00ab\u00a0reach\u00a0\u00bb because all the abuses will became stronger and worse with time or events (like having a baby or getting married.)\n\n  I\u2019ve looked at some of you commentary, and it seems like it\u2019s way worse that it seems in the actual comment.\n\n  First thing you could do is telling your parents if you have a good relationship. (Even if it is not that great, just don\u2019t go to them if they also are abusive.) Explain them everything, and ask them if you could live with them for a little moment, the time to be financially stable again. Ask them if they can pick you up. (I\u2019ve heard they are kinda far away.) \n\n  If you can\u2019t, try calling 211, it is a number that will help you connect with the correct organization available in you area if you are from the U.S witch I assumed because of your way to talk and the fact that you live pretty far from your parents. \n\n\n  I suppose that your phone is also \u00ab\u00a0secured\u00a0\u00bb in a way because you wrote that Reddit post. If not, make sure to secure every single one of your conversations about the \u00ab\u00a0runaway.\u00a0\u00bb It could be with a \u00ab\u00a0private\u00a0\u00bb conversation or even more secured, an other account and with the \u00ab\u00a0hidden\u00a0\u00bb mode on your browser. \n\n  You have to be quick and don\u2019t let him suspect anything.\n\n  The day of leaving, do not tell him. At all. If you can go see your friends, pretend doing that. If you can\u2019t, wait till he is gone for a few hours. \n\n Only take a little bag with you. With only your ID, phone and a few bucks, like if you were about to go with your friends or chill in a caf\u00e9. If your boyfriend know, then he will make things more difficult than they are. He will try to convince you to stay, but he could be far more violent or drug you again and make you stay by force. And at that point it will be far more difficult. \n\n  When you are at your parents home, or in a shelter, or at one of your friends home, do not take physical contact with him, at all costs. If you were forced to see him again in a way or an other, make sure that there is at least somebody with you. In certain countries, you can be escorted by the police. Don\u2019t also accept any drinks that he give you, or something to eat. And when it\u2019s time that he give you back your belongings, be sure that he either drop it somewhere or/and make one of your friend, or parents pick them up. \n\n  When you re safe, please go see a lawyer as soon as you can, they really can help you with that situation far more than I will. Try to have a new start, a new job, and then eventually, move out again. \n\n    Please, OP, understand that your relationship can be really dangerous and toxic to you. It will be really difficult at first but things will go better. You deserve so much better. \n\n  // Please if someone find a better alternative to something or just more advices, feel free to comment it. (And sorry for the bad English, I really did try my best with all the advices and stuff.)//",

            "comment": "I have watched some episode on 1000 ways to die whereby a man had an ED, so this man was taking tablets before he has sex. He had a mistress and a wife, what happened on that day was that he took 3 tabs, his mistress secretly gave him 3 tabs too and they did the deeds, when he got home his wife also secretly gave him 3 tabs that man died of unintended overdose. \n\nNow you may ask why I am telling you this? It\u2019s because the game he is playing is very dangerous imagine if you had took Benadryl on your own too then he secretly gave you as he confessed? Moral of the story is that it is very wrong to give people drugs secretly it could be fatal.",

He\u2019s already messing with you by isolating you from your support network and abusing you financially by threatening to kick you out of the house. I\u2019d quietly contact your mother and have her try and pick you up whenever he is out. Don\u2019t tell him you are leaving just vanish. Also he is dangerous, please for your safety take this seriously. I know your head is probably rationalizing his behavior but look at it through another persons eyes and do what should be done for your safety. I wish you the best of luck and please update us when you are safe.",

You're right to be alarmed.\nAre you sure he hasn't roofied other girls before to take advantage of them? Why did he even\nhave benadryl in his possesion when he was driving? Red flags everywhere.\n\nTell the police, tell your friends, your family, act quickly and quietly so you don't alert him. \nAbsolutely go stay with your mother, not him.\nGet out first, get your stuff later, don't meet him\nalone. \nI'm sorry you have to go through this. It's a hard time enough, but your safety comes first. The finances can be sorted out later.",

If you feel you can trust the police in your country/area, you may be able to request an escort to pick up your stuff later. \n\nThis is an intense breach or your consent. He is so casual about literally telling you he drugged you. Just because it was Benadryl and not a narcotic doesn\u2019t make it any less serious. Please please PLEASE leave as soon as possible and don\u2019t look back.",

Controlling a partner by drugging them without their knowing and then *bragging about it* afterwards?! The fact that he has total financial control over you and threatens to cut your phone like he is lording over you is equally scary. \n\nOh my gosh, contact your mother and get out.",

            "comment": "Leave him, I used to have an \"addiction\" if you can call it that to benadryl I was dependent on it to sleep like I couldnt sleep without it and it caused me a few minor helath problems while benadryl is relatively safe to use you can develop a dependency, overdose (heart issues, seizure, and sometimes death), and other affects and who knows how much he gave you for you to just pass out like that (depends on your tolerance tbh) and stay asleep like that and how many times hes done it that he hasnt admitted too. If your state is one party consent I'd take a voice recording and ask of he really drugged you, get him to admit it, wait until you are home, pack your things, leave, and get a restraining order\n\n\nEdit to add: just so it clear when you mix benadryl (or those little blue sleeping tablets you can get over the counter cause they are honestly almost the same thing) into juice or anything you cant really taste them that's how I was able to take several at a time if you still have the bottle look for residue at the bottom itll look pink or white or kind of the same color as the drink but it'll be noticable and if he gives you anything else to drink let it sit for a bit so if he didnt mix it in well enough any residue will settle at the bottom also if he gives you something take a small sip and try to figure out if it taste like it should while the Gatorade can mask the taste for the most part sometimes you can still taste it just a littel if that makes sense and please please be careful",

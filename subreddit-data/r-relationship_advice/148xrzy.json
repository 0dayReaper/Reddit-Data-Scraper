    "postText": "So this guy and I have a lot of mutual friends and our families are close. We've hooked up a couple times ( like 3) over the last couple of years and recently did again last week. \n\nHe asked me last minute out to dinner and then he wanted to go movies after as well. He dropped me off home at 11pm and I asked him if he wanted to have sex and he said no. He said he was tired and then asked if he could get a kiss. \n\nI kissed him and that's it. We talked a lot and he asked me my work schedule, what I'm doing on the weekend and stuff like that. \n\nWe've casually hooked up before so idk why he didn't want to have sex last night. He didn't have work or anything the next day.\n\nDid I turn him off during the date? \n\nUPDATE: \nI don't know why people get so upset lmao when some people just want opinions. Isn't that Reddit is for? BTW I want to know if it means that he wants something more now and not just looking for sex from me because it's been all about sex before.\n\nTIA",

Sex is great, and can be a big part of a healthy partnership. However, it's NEVER the main component in a healthy relationship. \n\nI'm saying this as a 37 year old married woman. My sex drive has gone up and down throughout the years and so has my husbands. You think it won't happen to you, but sweetie, trust me it will. \n\n**You can't build a relationship or your self worth on sex.**\n\nReal men/women of substance, want more than that. They want a partner with hobbies, that they can talk with on subjects that interest them, that excite them in all aspects of life, not just the bedroom.\n\nTake a alstep back and look at yourself and who you believe you are as a person. If you have the means to go to therapy, you should go. If not, there are lots of female oriented subs on Reddit where you can start chatting with other woman that can talk to you.",

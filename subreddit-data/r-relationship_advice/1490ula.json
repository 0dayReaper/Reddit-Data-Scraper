    "postText": "To begin, I\u2019m neurodivergent and have body dysmorphia so my concept of how I look to others and social nuances isn\u2019t the best. My apologies if this seems obvious.\n\nI\u2019ve got a larger chest, and find myself to look boxy when I wear certain clothing. I still wear them, but when I want to look nice I don\u2019t typically. I was wearing a cropped spaghetti strap with baggy high-waisted shorts the other day when he said that what I was wearing was more revealing than what is appropriate in public spaces. \n\nHe said he had noticed people looking at me, and while he would never want to dictate what I wear he wanted me to know that people might sexualize/assume things about me when I wear things that show cleavage. He also said that certain clothing is meant to draw sexual attention.\n\nThis confused and kind of embarrassed me, as I didn\u2019t think anything of it and get uncomfortable with sexual attention so it certainly wasn\u2019t my intent. I do get approached by people semi-regularly, and don\u2019t always see when someone is trying to flirt, but I never flirt back and always set things clear when I do notice. He has also said previously I should assume when a man I don\u2019t know approaches me, he is most likely pursuing me.\n\nWhile he agreed that what I wear didn\u2019t justify people being inappropriate towards me, I should still consider that certain clothing might make it more likely. Now I feel confused about where exactly the line is and have been experiencing anxiety about how people perceive me, I feel like I don\u2019t know the rules. Especially since he insisted he doesn\u2019t want to tell me what to/not to wear.\n\nTLDR; Boyfriend thinks my clothing might attract sexual attention and thinks I should consider this more in the future. Also believes men I don\u2019t know are pursuing me when they approach me.\n\n1. What should I do, and have I been disrespectful? \n\n2. Is his concern valid and healthy?",

He might have a fragile ego though so be careful how you say this.",

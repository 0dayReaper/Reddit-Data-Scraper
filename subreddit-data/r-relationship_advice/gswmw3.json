    "postText": "When he turned 16 and got his license, we allowed him to use an old car from a relative. At that time, my son had around $5k in savings. We made him a promise saying that we\u2019d match whatever he ended up with at graduation. Reasonably, we thought he\u2019d maybe double that to $10k through jobs and we\u2019d match for a reasonable $20k car. \n\nHe now has $35k to use for a car. He said he did have a little over $10k but that he bought smart stock options in April and now will have around $35k after tax (personally I don\u2019t think he did anything besides get stupid lucky). \n\nHe is insisting that we follow through with our promise and match that. Financially, it\u2019s not a huge dent for us since he also surprised us with a nice merit scholarship (that he did *earn*). The problem arises in that we really don\u2019t want to break the promise we made to him, but we also strongly believe that an 18 year old driving around in a **SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLAR** car is a very bad idea. He can\u2019t even take it to school until his sophomore year, and the insurance on that will be a nightmare. \n\nWhat I am asking is, would the better course of action be to break the promise, and likely face resentment? Or keep it and cough up the money?\n\nThanks in advance for the advice.\n\nEdit: Talked about it with my wife; we are considering a couple of avenues atm including trust or maybe fixed income until it can be used for med school. My son uses Reddit and considering that this is on r/all now, I\u2019m just waiting for him to see it and burst into my home office room.\n\nEdit2: He\u2019s super duper close with his girlfriend. I told her, and she said she\u2019d talk him out of it. Personally, I totally understand where my son is coming from. I wanted a car like that at that age too, and my parents did end up indulging just a little bit, but now I can see how it was a waste of money. I only used it for two years. I\u2019ll make an update post in a few days about what happens.",

If the parents want to be pedantic, they can argue that he didn't save $35K.\n\nI'd offer two choices: \n\n1. We'll match the entire $35K, but you are limited to spending $5K of it on a car (thinking Tesla Model 3 which would give him enough street cred at school) and the rest needs to go towards car insurance and education (baller laptop/PC purchase included)\n2. We'll match the total saved, $10K and you can spend that on a $45K car - we'll cover insurance until certain age\n3. ? Something else along those lines\n\nAlso, make sure he knows wtf he is doing and is cognizant of any taxes he owes on the gambling",

The investments only gained about 1% Y/Y, but that's another story.\n\nI didn't do great with credit cards and used 1/3 of this to smother that fire. Zero credit card debt since 2013. I took out half of it and paid off my remaining student loans in 2015. The other 1/6? I think it went towards a car or a hospital bill.\n\nI guess it became emergency money. (I needed to buy a house with my wife in 2017. We did all right. Effectively put 3% down and the lender gave 2% of it back.)\n\nThe lesson is, of course, if you want to see 5 figures of money disa-fucking-ppear, give it to a teenager with no strings.

It might appreciate in value, but a house typically *costs* money. I am colleagues with a very successful financial advisor that will tell you a house is one of the worst investments a person can make, simply because most people don't treat it as such. They buy a house to live in and typically spend way more money on it (remodeling, maintenance, equipment to do maintenance, taxes, insurance, interest, etc.) than they'll ever get out.\n\nPaying for your mortgage and building equity rather than paying for someone else's and building their equity is very attractive though.",

He isn't looking at houses probably, but an assist with a down payment would always be helpful. How he made the money isn't really an aspect that I think is worth dwelling on other than to say that some education in how to responsibly work the stock market is always worthwhile, but making sure he won't get a car that may be too much car for such a young man needs to be considered.",

Put it in a high interest savings account for him as emergency/house savings for the future (or look into various low risk investments).\n\nHe might be peeved about it now but I guarentee he'd be grateful for that after he graduates college. Most 18 year olds don't understand financial responsibility. At 18, if I had that kind of money I probably would have been an idiot and bought some fancy car.

Can you imagine having to read 20 pages of fine print covering all contingencies and signing in the presence of a notary just to make an agreement about buying your kid a car? OP is bending over backwards to try to keep their word, but the gambling clearly violates any reasonable understanding of their agreement. That would certainly not have been allowed if this were a business agreement and you hired a lawyer to write up the contract.",

The remaining money he already has will make sure he has enough for insurance, gas, maintenance, etc. The $35K you give him should go into an interest bearing account and he can get it after college, either to be used for a down payment on a house or for graduate school (I think I saw you mention he was pre-med).

He graduated near the top of his class and got a full merit scholarship to a top 5 public university. He\u2019s definitely a very hard worker. \n\nThe thing is, he knows nothing about markets. Nothing. Not one thing. I know for a fact as as recently as February he said he barely understood them. He wants to go to medical school. As such, I know he didn\u2019t just do some fantastic due diligence to make a smart investment. If you look at trends, brokerage accounts spiked in the number of openings during the COVID-19 dip. People who knew nothing about investing wanted in on the action. Even now he can\u2019t fully explain why his investment was a good choice other than \u201cI saw the dip as an opportunity.\u201d I asked him \u201can opportunity in what way?\u201d And he can\u2019t answer. \n\nThis leads me to the conclusion that he gambled. Plain and simple. This is the biggest problem I have with actually matching it. I don\u2019t want to teach him that gambling pays off. Sure, calculated risks can be very rewarding, but he gambled. He didn\u2019t perform some analysis or even really know what he did, so I know he gambled. I\u2019ve seen first hand what\u2019s happened to friends with gambling addictions. Nothing good comes from it. And he didn\u2019t trade stocks, he traded options. For those of you who don\u2019t know much about options, they can wipe out your savings faster than they\u2019ll double them if you have no idea what you\u2019re doing.",

Fulfilling your side of the deal, while unreasonable and not at all in the spirit of the original bargain, will be the best for your relationship if you go about it right.\n\n1. Actually communicate all of your hesitations you have told us here: worried about the \"easy money\" mentality of gambling (have him read the wall street bets sub-reddit for laughs), as well as what you had expected and are worried about.\n\n2. Have him show you the hard financials and offer match the after tax earnings.\n\n3. Some people here recommended the wise choice of 10k match for car + 25k for house. However, the real gift is the opportunity to learn responsibility himself - I recommend offering even more incentive to be wise by saying you will put 30K down for a house with a 10k car match, or the full amount now. Yes he will blow the money on a car. He will regret that when he gets to med school, if not sooner. But the -35k blown early in his life could reinforce a trusting relationship with you guys, if done right, and teach him the importance of money management that will help pay of loans significantly down the line.\n\n2 more thoughts: if he has siblings, this is going to be a huge issue for them and their relationships - might be worth a breach in trust so you don't play favorites and inspire jealousy, but that should be communicated as well. Secondly, you could offer the 10K match now and guarantee a 25K check after his first year of college where he will no doubt prefer the cash (especially if he has to work his way through, I.e. no allowances or handouts). College makes you realize how broke you are, the 25K cash will be a beacon of hope for him if he has to survive a year broke after dumping it all on a car.",

Ok, yeah, he got lucky on taking a risk. I get that you don't really approve of the methods, and that's valid. But I guarantee that the more you express disapproval of the methods, the more resentment you'll build in him. The time for a \"okay, here's why that wasn't actually a great idea\" conversation is \\*after\\* you've reached arrangements on the money.

And then explain to him how proud you are of him and that he truly put himself in a position to kick start the rest of his life (whether that's using the money for a down payment on a house in the future, retirement, paying off debt, etc.). Very few 18 year olds have *any* money in their bank account.\n\nI would stick to your word and double what he puts in, but set a limit, say $30,000 total ($15,000 from him, $15,000 from you).

    "postText": "It has been almost 8 years since we broke up. My ex and I dated for around 2 years my junior year of hs to my freshman year of college. We were each other's first loves and I took her virginity. We broke up because she was planning on going into the military so we would never see each other. Young and dumb we broke up through text because she was still back in my hometown as she was younger than me. We had a pretty bad breakup and she blocked me and did not talk for a long time after. Over the years she unblocked me and has always found reasons to reach out to me periodically such as texting me random questions or snapping me when she would be out late on the weekend / trying to add me on facebook and instagram. I wouldn't allow her to follow me on anything and didn't let her follow me on things either because I was not ready to see her post etc. I would talk to her when she would snap me and she would go cold. She'd Give super short answers or nothing for me to work with so then I would just leave her on read eventually. Around 3-4 years after she ended up at my college house one night due to her friend asking my roommate if they could come to a party we were going to. (at this point she had decided to try college). Her friend came into my room and asked, \"aren't you going to talk to xxx? She said that she wants to talk to you now that she is in the cities. So she sent my ex into my room and we talked a little bit and she was pretty drunk by that point. We started making out and about to hook up when she started crying saying things like \"you're the reason I started partying\" blah blah blah. \"My mom thinks I'm not over you, but I am\" and then proceeded to puke all over my room. I called it there and we went to bed. She got up the next day and was picked up by some friends and acted like nothing happened. I finally got her to open up to me a tiny bit and we met up to talk. I had talked about trying to date again -  she would not even really look at me while she talked but she said that she did not want to get back together etc so we parted our ways. Not soon after she must have decided to go back into the military because the next time she tried to contact me she was stationed in a different state. Same thing happened - went super cold when I answered so I stopped talking to her. A year goes by and she tries to add me on insta and I do not respond to it - then she cancels it and tries to again a month later, late on a Saturday night. So I reach out again and say what's up. We talk for about a week and she is surprisingly giving me stuff to work with and being fun like when we were dating. At one point when I did not answer for a while she double messaged and said \"soooo, you need to respond faster because i'm impatient.. you should know that\". Eventually things fizzled out and we stopped talking because the break up was brought up. She eventually started dating a new guy and got pregnant. Fast forward to the present day and she lives even further away and they are no longer together. I checked my facebook around a month ago and she sent me a friend request. I accepted it this time and reached out saying that I did not expect to get a request from her and she responded with - \"lol I bet. No, I've randomly tried adding you for years to see if you would accept and this is the first time you've actually accepted. It's kind of me trying to see if you've finally reached the point where you could now see my life and not get upset. Because last time we talked you said you wouldn't accept because you didn't want to see what I was up to cuz it hurt still\". Like what? Wouldn't I reach out if I wanted to? I then tried to add her on insta but she did not add me back.  What does she want from me? I feel like the stupid Katy Perry song \"It's never really over\" is on repeat. \n\nTL;DR: my ex from highschool will not allow me to forget her and keeps contacting me over the years but then goes cold when I give her attention. Katy Perry's, \"It's never really over\". What does she want?",

A lot of people can be like that. Did they move on ? Did they get a good job? Is the new partner better then me somehow ?  People are weird sometimes.\n\nI had a ex of 7 years who \u201cwanted to stay friends\u201d after cheating on me and doing all kinds of messed up manipulative junk. I was like definitely not. Then I found out later he\u2019d had a mutual fb friend keeping track of me and telling him.",

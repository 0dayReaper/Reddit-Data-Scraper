Thank you all for your advice. My gf's grandfather came and we had our dinner yesterday, so this is an update to that post. I just want to say first, I am drunk, so please excuse any typos.\n\nAnyway, I was really freaked out all summer about wanting to impress him. I was seriously considering  pulling the Skinner scam and buying takeout and disguising it, but I decided to just go for trying to make something myself. I spend pretty much all of July trying to make steak. I started with cheap stuff, and it was really, \\*really\\* hard at first, but I learned from my mistakes.\n\nI wanted to go all out, so I bought really nice steak to make when the day came. I made three. One for all of us, and it ended up being better than I hoped, though obviously not Michelin Star quality. I also brought some really expensive (at least for a college student) Cabernet to pair, although he actually brought rum, so we had both. It's around midnight on August 16th here in the Eastern United States; this happened on the evening of August 14th (he came early due to changes in our school schedule). He said that the steak was nice. He and I went out for burgers and hotdogs the next evening (today, but technically actually yesterday). It was just him and I. We also had a metric fuck-ton of beer. All in all, it was a really positive experience, and we got along very well. I'm glad I didn't risk trying to pass off steakhouse food as my own, though I still want to try to see if I can fool my professor's friend. Maybe after the pandemic has passed (grandfather, gf, and I all got tested before meeting for dinner).\n\nI really love my girlfriend :)",

Someone, *anyone who can*, must be the cog in the machine to make sure it churns flawlessly. It\u2019s like some sort of manic PTSD driving you to not let a bad dish out of the kitchen. This is probably how control freaks are made.",

I\u2019ll put out all the ingredients and tell him what goes together and what to make. I try not to hover but end up in the kitchen anyway turning down the stove, changing the oven temperature. But when I walk in there and see him putting the potatoes to roast in the oven at the same time as he\u2019s putting on the vegetables or heating up some baked beans etc my blood pressure starts increasing and my eye starts twitching... so I can\u2019t imagine how you feel walking into a kitchen and immediately knowing things are not going to go right.",

She gets really stressed in the kitchen and gets jealous because of my ability to cook on the fly without recipes and the fact that I can completely shift directions if something doesn't work halfway through. I also hate washing dishes, and she enjoys it for some reason. She called me one night for help while cooking for her parents while I was making dinner for myself. I wound up walking her through a pretty basic shrimp scampi step by step over the phone while I was making gyudon. I don't think I'll ever live that down.",

We all have to learn somehow and most of us aren't perfect right off the bat. We fuck up and learn from it. :)\n \nIt's even such a common situation and stereotype that 'men try to cook or do chores or something and just fuck it all up, so women have to step in and do it for them anyway' that people who know this will actually suck at it on purpose when asked to do something just so they won't get asked again!    \n\nI'm not saying or thinking this is what your husband is doing, though. Just mentioning how common this 'he messes up, so I step in to help, but because he always has me stepping in to fix his fuckups before they even happen, he never learns how to do it himself' thing is. Hope that makes sense - I'm running on fumes, haha. Plus this is a (super common) phenomenon I could go on and on about! Anyway, I know how you feel and have so been there. I know how stressful it can feel. Good luck with your work and everything!",

I cooked for ~10 years, even took some culinary classes, worked in a four star restaurant, etc. But the main restaurant that I worked at for about 7 years was a fast-paced diner/all day breakfast place that started to make me decide cooking just wasn't for me. It was in a popular New England town with festivals every week, and I ran the kitchen during the afternoon and night - which meant 14 hour days where you couldn't leave the kitchen for *the entire time*, and were constantly running 30+ checks at once in a 120 degree kitchen. Even on non-festival days, I still worked 10-13 hour days 5-6 days a week that were busy as hell all day, and you could almost never call off if you were sick because finding a replacement chef was almost impossible.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there were some fun parts. When you work with a few guys that you've been cooking with for years then you start to get into a \"groove\" together and can consistently put out every order in under 15 minutes while joking around and messing with servers (I used to throw an egg up in the air near them - not *at* them, just so it would land right in front of them - and yell \"Catch!\", and all kinds of other \"pranks\" - ie, send the dishwasher to the grocery store across the street with a bucket to buy steam for the steam tables, etc), and that's a pretty fun experience. Knowing exactly what your other cooks are doing without even having to look because you've worked together for so long is pretty cool. But after a decade of doing it then I decided it just wasn't what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Even moving on from the diner and working in a four star restaurant at a much slower pace just wasn't my thing. I even tried another few restaurants, but eventually decided that it just wasn't for me.\n\nBut, at least now I can cook some great food for my fiancee, though I never critique her cooking unless she asks for help. It does sort of suck that I'm pretty much the designated cook at family events, though. As soon as I show up for Thanksgiving or anything then everyone clears out of the kitchen and expects me to take over, or constantly asks if they're doing something right - even though my Mother/Grandmother/Aunts/Uncles are all pretty competent cooks. Not to mention that I've been doing freelance programming all my life so I'm the \"computer guy\" in my family, as well.\n\nBut now I'm a boat mechanic and much happier. I *love* working on the water, and I run my own business and make my own hours. Plus the money is a whole lot better. But I give a *lot* of credit to chefs - it's a hell of a rough job. If I have a good meal in a restaurant then I always send a tip back to the cooks - I remember how much I appreciated it when I was in the kitchen.",

Sous vide salmon is the second best way I\u2019ve ever had it (my favorite being smoked, but I also smoke my own). \n\nI\u2019ve found that the best way to make salmon in an immersion cooker is with dill and butter. I usually do 25 to 35 minutes at 42c\ufffc. But the key for me is a crispy top (personal preference, one of my best friends is a salmon purist and they call it sacrilege). So I actually put it in the broiler in my oven for about 3 to 4 minutes on a high broil. Browns and crisps the top, but doesn\u2019t overcook the fish underneath.\ufffc finish it with a little fresh squeezed lemon on top (after you plate the fish)\ufffc and it\u2019s sublime.",

All of them have their own style. They use weird, unique, outstanding combinations of spices and foods. They combine french, German, Italian or Swedish kitchen with Asian or Latin American style of cooking. They overspice foods to get a certain reaction. They are unique and outstanding, brave and adventurous - and that's why they got their stars.\n\nEdit: Just a small addition to this: cooking Michelin star dishes isn't that hard for most half-qualified cooks. It's not hard to recreate a Michelin star dish if you know how it's done and what is used. But that's also not the challenge. The challenge is to engineer the dish, to create it in the first place. Balancing the taste, experimenting with ingredients, finding the right texture - that's what's hard.  \nIt's like Columbus's egg: it's not hard to recreate, but you have to come up with it first.",

These can range from anything small like investing in a cast iron skillet (and maintaining it) all the way up to purchasing some dry aged steaks from your local butcher (not the super market, an actual butcher).  I'd be willing to bet you trying to constantly improve to impress him and keep his daughter fed will go over a-okay with him.  He might even feel a little proud of you for trying.  Or, look up any of the super simple pasta recipes that no one ever thinks to make because there's less ingredients in them then fingers on one of your hands, but any pro michelin star chef would be excited if they had a well crafted plate of Cacio e pepe or any other pasta dish set in front of them that relies more on the quality of ingredients over the technique or lavish displays.",

We don\u2019t judge our friends/family\u2019s food the way we judge restaurant food (food cooked for you with love tastes a million time better than food you paid a lot of money for), and we certainly don\u2019t compare their food to our own. You definitely deserve to relax and I\u2019m sure he would adore the story of you trying to test out steak for him. Chefs know that not everyone is a natural cook and we don\u2019t expect if of other people. We only expect people who actually work in restaurants to be able to cook well because that\u2019s their damn job.\n\nSide note, if you\u2019re interested, I could teach you some bacisllg fail-proof tips to make a damn good steak, I\u2019ve taught it to many people.\n\nEdit:\n\n1) Get a thermometer!!! You need one to guarantee a good steak. You can get a great one for like $15, which costs less than that nice steak you might have ruined otherwise\n\n2) Learn: wet = no brown. Dry + heat = brown = flavor. Juiciness = NOT OVERCOOKED. \u201cLocking in juices\u201d is total bs. You seat to get good flavor. You can\u2019t get a good sear did your pan isn\u2019t hot and also if the surface of your meat is not completely dry.\n\n3) Make a choice: Do you prioritize flavor or tenderness? If you salt your steak early (as described in the next step), the meat will be better flavored throughout (the salt has time to absorb throughout the whole steak), but it will be a little firmer. If you salt it just before cooking, slightly less flavor since you\u2019ve only seasoned the very outside, but the meat will be a little more tender. Either of these choices will result in great steak, and my choice is usually salting beforehand. \n\n3) Take your steak (get a THICK steak\u20141-1/2 to 2\u201d, thinner steaks will overcook) and put it on a cooling rack set over a sheet pan or a plate (this is so you can get air flow on all sides on the steak). If you\u2019re going to salt early, season your steak now, heavily, with salt and pepper. Now, put the steak in your fridge *uncovered* overnight. The circulating air in the fridge will dry the outside of the steak overnight and help it develop a nice crust.\n\n4) The next day, preheat your oven to 275F (135 C) and get a heavy-bottomed pan (like a cast iron or stainless steel skillet\u2014a thin pan will not hold heat well and you won\u2019t get a great crust on your steak) and get it ripping hot. Get your fan on running as high as you can. Open all the windows. Take the steak out of the fridge (right before you\u2019re going to cook it, you don\u2019t want it to come up to room temperature or else it will overcook faster and also the outside will start to get damp). If you want to salt the steak now (if you didn\u2019t the day before), do so. (Do not let the steak rest with the salt on it for long or else moisture will start to draw out of the steak and prevent good browning). Throw a glug of neutral oil or fat with a high smoke point (not olive oil...Vegetable oil, bacon fat, etc are good) into the pan and add your steak. Cook for 30 seconds, flip, and do this 2 more times\u2014a total of 1 minute each side. You can do 1 1/2 minutes each side if you have an extra thick steak and/or you want a darker crust, but I wouldn\u2019t go beyond that. Flipping is totally ok and actually helps a better crust develop.\n\n5) Take the steak out and put it on a baking sheet. Into the pan (turn the heat down to medium-low now) add a couple whole smashed cloves of garlic, and a a couple springs of thyme and/or rosemary (I also like to add a couple shtick slices of shallot) and a big ol knob of butter. Cook that for a couple minutes while scraping up any browned bits of steak, and cook and stir until the garlic starts to get a little toasty looking on the very edges. What you\u2019re doing is infusing the butter with the herbs and steak bits. \n\n6) Now, pour all of that godly delicious butter over your steak (get some under the steak too), and cook it in the oven until it\u2019s 5 degrees below your final desired temperature of done-ness. I wish I could tell you how long this takes but it really depends on the thickness of the steak and how long you seared it for\u2014check after 10 minutes and then keep checking every 5 the first time you do this so you can get acquainted with how quickly the temperature rises. Make sure you\u2019re sticking the thermometer in the very center of the steak, and make sure you\u2019re giving the thermometer enough time to come up to temperature to get a proper reading (this will depend on the brand of thermometer). Baste the steak on occasion.\n\n7) Let your steak rest for 10 minutes (during this step, the juices re-absorb into the muscle fibers and they steal will cook a little more a climb up in temperature. Now, slice and serve.\n\nLet me know if anything doesn\u2019t make sense or needs\nclarification, I\u2019m trying to be as descriptive as possible and assume no previous knowledge of cooking.\n\ntl;dr: 1) dry a good, thick steak out in the fridge overnight 2) sear it in a hot pan 3) Cover steak in herb butter and finish in a low oven.",

Do race car drivers expect their Ubers to zip thru traffic at breakneck pace?  Do professional photographers expect photos by lay persons to be professional grade? Do film directors criticize cell phone videos as inadequate?\n\nMostly, why does reddit swallow dumb shit like this whole?",

Learn lessons from experts anytime you can - there is no disgrace in this.\n\nI am no cook.  My dad would have me help him to grill out every weekend to grill steaks or burgers.  His burgers were shit but his steaks were the best I have ever had - honestly the best I will ever have.\n\nWhere I am going with this is, every weekend, my kids want us to grill out.  We grill veggies (squash, peppers and asparagus - then finish it with mushrooms) that become incredibly sweet because of the grill.  Then we cook the meat - Steaks are my favorite.  My kids want grilled burgers, hot dogs, brats.  My wife and I want steaks.\n\n\nThis is the gift that keeps giving.  It creates memories.  This is allowing you to explore and create wonderful memories for you, your girlfriend and more.\n\nI wish you the best.  I remember your original post.  I am glad you are learning.

    "postText": "The reaction to my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ca66sv/mom_had_an_affair_18_years_ago_i_18m_am_the/) put an uncomfortable amount of pressure on me to write this update.\n\nI am not sure if it's what's you want to hear, but things are more or less back to a \"normal\" state, if you consider other events.\n\nUnfortunately, my grandpa died at the beginning of this week, and I am still processing it.\n\nI did manage to talk with both my mom and dad, and I know where I now stand in relation with them, as well as my siblings.\n\nI am not sure I would have had the courage to say what I had to say if not for the amount of help and advice in the comments.\n\nI think it is safe to say both my parents love me, and what happened two weeks ago was an overreaction to a fight between my parents. It makes me uncomfortable knowing I am not aware of my own environment, but a stranger in the comments can tell me what's happening in my life with only a few lines of text from my side. A lot of comments were spot on about what is happening in my life.\n\nI have so far went through 40% (I estimate) of the comments, but I have given up, there are too many for me to keep up with.\n\nThe conclusion is that I am definitely going to college, it will be the college I have always wanted to go to, and I will have the same experience as my siblings. The money to pay for all this already exists, my family is not going bankrupt as suggested, my dad just had a mental breakup with all the issues around my grandpa and his fight with my mom.\n\nEven if my dad would have went through with his decision, my grandma let me know my grandpa left me and my siblings a sum we will have to split between the three of us, but enough to put me through college.\n\nWhat started the entire scandal was poor timing on my part, my parents just had a fight, and then I showed up \"hey, pay for my college\".\n\nMy parents were talking about us, their children, and mom said something to the lines of \"to think you wanted to split up when I came back pregnant\", or something like that, I was not there, this is what she told me. I guess dad was talking how proud he was of his children, and mom wanted to express her \"gratitude\" for dad raising me as his own, and dad took it as \"the affair was the best decision I ever made\" or something like that. And their fight escalated from there, and mom told dad something like \"what makes you think any of them are yours\".\n\nYeah, it went downhill from there fast. Shortly after that my dumb face showed up, and here I am.\n\nDad and mom have since made up, mom is still a mess, dad is not handling my grandpa's passing away too well either.\n\nI did talk with my siblings, and my sister raised a storm and rode it here while blasting my parents on the phone, ha ha. My brother was calmer, but made his feelings known in no uncertain terms as well once he got back home.\n\nMy grandpa passing away sort of kept spirits calm, I guess, and shifted the focus to dealing with that.\n\nReading the comments was a mind opening experience. I felt unprepared for the world out there. Many have asked how I had no idea how to apply for loans or grants. Well, in my defense, when you go year after year after year knowing you have nothing to worry about, that your college as good as paid for already, you don't really have to worry about anything else. Of course I knew there are loans and other things students have to be aware of, but it didn't apply to me.\n\nI went from \"I am going to college, can't wait\" to \"you're not my son and I will not pay for your college\" in less than 24 hours.\n\nOthers have been prepared for this, at the very least they knew they had to get a loan, or get a job, look for a place to live, and so on. For me it was a sudden change in reality.\n\nGoing through the comments I managed to put a list together with various \"tips and tricks\", what jobs are available for students, how to find a place to live, how to get a credit card, a bank account, a cell phone plan, and so on. Really good stuff that I think, even after the return to normal, will help me.\n\nMy parents have been called more names then they go by, and that was uncomfortable to read, and I haven't even read all comments. I can't even imagine what else lies in the comments, waiting.\n\nDad is very sorry, apologetic, about his reaction and behavior. I understand his reaction, but I still feel hurt by it. I understand he was not in the best place of mind, but I can't control my feelings either. We will be alright, and this hasn't irreparably damaged our relationship.\n\nMom hasn't handled everything that well. But she is coming around, and she answered some more questions for me.\n\nWhen mom had an affair years ago, and got pregnant with me, my parents started divorce. Mom moved in with the man she had the affair with, but after a few months that guy decided he wants nothing to do with it. He kicked mom out, and she had nowhere to go. So my grandparents took her in, because she was still the mother of their ~~nephews~~ grand kids (I am getting a lot of heat for this \"mistake\", but know in my family's culture, grandparents call their grand kids nephews as well). Mom and dad got back together, after a lot of work, dad took me as his own, and that's my life since then.\n\nThe man who is my natural father is not in the picture any more. Dad didn't really know who he is, and mom hasn't heard or seen him ever since. He was fully aware mom was pregnant with his child, I guess he had more important things to do. But it doesn't sound like he was about to cure world hunger, she met him in a bar, not at a fund raiser.\n\nAnd I don't feel a need to know any more about who he is. I thought about the matter the last two weeks, since I've been aware of everything, and haven't really felt a desire to know who he is, where he is, if he is still alive, if I have other siblings out there.\n\nI was suggested to go and buy a DNA kit from 23andme, maybe I can find him that way, but I think I will avoid doing this specifically so I don't find him or he finds me. As far as I care, I have a mom and dad and a brother and a sister, and that's my family.\n\nMoving forward I do plan of getting a job, and becoming more independent, but not in an attempt to distance myself from my family, but to feel like I would not be lost in the world if my family suddenly disappears.\n\nMy mom admits I've been babied way more than my siblings, and that they should have prepared me more for what's coming next.\n\nI did learn where I stand with my family, and it's safe to say that I am loved, and I have options. I thought I am isolated, but my world is wider than I thought. Grandparents, siblings, my aunt, my cousins, all have my back.\n\nI think my parents are human, and they make mistakes, and even though this was not their greatest moment, I think I will look at everything as nothing more than a weak moment in an otherwise wonderful relationship.\n\nThank you.\n\nEdit: in my family's cultural background, grandparents call their grand kids nephews as well. Stop calling me names, it was not a mistake, please.",

Actually, OP, ***you*** are the asshole for whining about the guy you've been dating for 3 months and then decided your personalities weren't a match on Reddit.  The fact that you don't like his personality doesn't mean he's abusing you.  It means he's just not a match for you.  And, in fact, you're the bitch for thinking it's ***his*** problem that he didn't change his personality for you within three months.  And the top commenters in that threat were assholes for beating up a guy who probably already feels insecure about the fact that he's geeky and likely experienced a shit ton of rejection in school and growing up.",

But I think most people are not saints. The smallest thing and the littlest details often get brought up in a fight let alone something as big as an affair.\n\nUltimately I'm happy as well the OP situation is working out and only wish his family gets stronger for it.",

It\u2019s not that you \u201chad no idea what was going on in your home\u201d. People behave pretty predictably, and so your dad\u2019s actions were less of a mystery to other redditors.

When it came out, my brother basically turned on my dad, his real dad popped up, and my brother was basically like \"Nah, this my dad, not the dude who raised me\"\n\nHurt my dad something fierce, he doesn't care about blood, that was his kid. \n\nTo further flip scenarios, real dad is wealthy, our dad worked hard to provide a middle class life, in an upper class area (because that's where my mom wanted to be). College was always questionable for us, but all of a sudden not for brother. \n\nDespite us having grown up in the west coast, he turned east coast elite like his dad. He went to Philips Academy like many really well off high schoolers and rubbed shoulders with the children of those who pull the strings in this country, decided on NYU after, been mulling law school after just barely missing a Rhodes scholarship, and currently works as a legal aide pulling $30k a month. \n\nSo, I guess good for him, but he basically abandoned us for himself. He shaped up some in recent years and talks to our dad more, he straight up cut him out for the first few years, but just calls him by name... Never dad... \n\nA falling out with his real dad has helped a little though. He's realized his real dad measures the success of his children by wealth and status, while our dad just cares if we're happy. Brother is still a piece of work though.",

You're expected to extremely successful and being anything less than that gets you the cold shoulder from daddy. \n\n\nThey have far more opportunities than anyone else due to family connections and wealth but it does still kinda suck.\n\n\nI infer from the later part of his statement that his brother learned that the hard way.",

The grandparents cared more about their grandchild despite however horrible it was for the father and I'd imagine they were instrumental in convincing the father to eventually take her back in as well. \n\nBut they did manage to have a good kid. I don't think the father will live this down anytime soon, though. He's already lived with this for close to two decades and the wound has never healed. What the mother did, though, was cut it open completely anew recently. I now know why she was crying nonstop this week. She was the catalyst for everything.",

Your mother put those thoughts in his mind when she said the most hurtful and cruel statement she could think of. Have a talk with hour father over some cold beers.

I can't imagine how difficult this must have been for all parties involved, you especially.\n\nI'm going to go against the grain of some other comments here and suggest you get that DNA test anyway. Not because you should find the rest of your biological family (I understand how you feel right now about having one family and ONLY one family) but this could change later in life.\n\nAlso, more importantly, that second half of your genes could contain any number of medical time bombs that you have a right to know about. Since you don't know your bio-dad's family medical history, taking the test would tell you if you've been passed any genetic predisposition to certain ailments, like diabetes, heart disease, cancer, etc. I would look into genetic testing that ONLY covers medical analysis, just to check this stuff out.\n\nBest of luck to you at Uni. I hope you and your family continue to work things out.",

You're being incredibly generous with them here, and you're a lovely person for that. But they should have done better. Our sense of identity and belonging is SUCH a huge part of us, and they played fast and loose with both of those things for you. I'm glad they seem to be owning that now, and are working to make it up to you.\n\n\nBut also remember that if your feelings change shape about this anywhere down the road, that's ok. If you ever find you don't feel OK about this, that's alright. Whatever happens, know you are justified in feeling whatever you need to feel to move past this fuck up on their part. And remember the fierce love and support your siblings and your grandma and grandpa, though he may not be with you any more, have shown you. These people are your family and they love you, and you're so lucky. Keep 'em close. \n\nLove to you friend, well done again and have the BEST time at college.

Your mom should not have thrown her affair in your dad's face and your dad should not have dropped this earth shattering revelation on you just because your mom pissed him off, they also probably should have not kept this a secret from you for so long. I think getting out there and getting a job is a good idea, even if it's part time retail or food service. You don't know how many people never get a job until after they graduate and have no idea how to function in a work place. Best of luck with everything.",

It rung true then, and it's been getting a lot of mileage.\n\nPeople of all ages can become feral, spiteful, fear-filled and cruel at times. For the most part, we learn to filter and control it, but it never goes away.\n\nYou got caught up in the product of that, of people going to extraordinary lengths to harm one another. It happens, it's unfortunate and it can come on like an earthquake: quick, devastating, and unpredictable. \n\nIt doesn't always get resolved like this, but if in our frothy rancor we can remember that we're humans with futures and emotional investments and goals, that cutting off your nose to spite your face is not a worthy endeavor, we can minimize the damage. Hell, something as intimate and vulnerable can strengthen a relationship. \n\nBut there is a valuable lesson here. These things happen, be aware of them, whether external or internal. The spiteful child can be calmed or sidestepped, and the inner rage calmed, as simply as taking a step back to notice it and slow things down. Pivotal moments like that come and go in seconds, be vigilant. You could be in your mother or father's shoes some day. Or again a pawn in someone else's game of spite.",

Moved in with affair dude that kicked her out and then her \"ex\" husbands parents took her in. They reconcile and try to be a family.\n\nWhat utter trash in an argument to basically say, \"Why do you think ANY of them are yours?\" Wow, just fucking wow. I would (as the dad) seriously consider divorce. That shit is water under the bridge and you want to sit here and rub my nose in it again 18 years later? \n\nShe needs fucking therapy. And how to actually fight fair. I would be so hurt as the husband to basically be made to relive that shit because she thinks that stuff is over and done with.",

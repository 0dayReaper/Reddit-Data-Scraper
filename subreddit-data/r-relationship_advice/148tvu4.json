    "postText": "\n\n\nBackstory: We met on hinge. She told me she has an avoidant attachment style. In the span of 3 weeks we have hung-out 7 times. She hasn\u2019t ever had a serious relationship. She told me every guy that gets close to her she pushes away and likes guys who aren\u2019t interested in her.\n\nEvery time we hung out she told me how much fun she had and how we need to keep doing it. I told her a couple days ago this isn\u2019t just a short term thing for me or a fling. \n\nToday she told me she wants to be on the same page but isn\u2019t sure if she sees a future with me. I told her I wasn\u2019t sure either bc I\u2019m still getting to know her but if we continue down this path I will want something serious. After talking more she then changed and said she just doesn\u2019t see a future with me she thinks. \n\nIt just sucks bc I don\u2019t just take a liking to anyone. I liked her. Not sure how to really respond or move forward. I could continue to see her and hope it would turn into something serious but idk. What should I do? Should I cut it off? Or continue to have fun with her hoping she comes around?",

You can't be with someone who doesn't want to get close to you. You respond by letting her go and finding someone who is ready to have a serious relationship, because that's what you want. She's not ready for that.",

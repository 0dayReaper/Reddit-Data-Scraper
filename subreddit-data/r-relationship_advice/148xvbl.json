    "postText": "My girlfriend was talking to her ex on the phone texting. At the end he sent a dick pick said he was horny and she replied I'm horny too. I didn't get to see the rest of the text she snatched the phone and deleted all her texts in the Trash. There has been numerous things that make you go hmm but there is always plausible deniability. This is not deniable shes acting strange and I'm picking up a guilt vibe. She saw a text I was asking a friend how to get rid of this other woman and I did not cheat. Now she is calling me a cheater. I have a pretty good idea but I want to hear it from my fellow redditors. What's the 411 people?",

This is why it is important to cut all ties with ex lovers when you split up, unless you have kids together. The temptation is always there to reconnect. What other reason is there to stay in touch?\n\nPlus, you are both a bit too mature to be playing these stupid phone games. Sending photos, silly messages, shows me that she has a lot of growing up to do.",

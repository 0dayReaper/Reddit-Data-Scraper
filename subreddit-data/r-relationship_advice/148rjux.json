    "postText": "I have been hanging out with this new friend group for about 2-3 years now and there is a girl in this group that I have some attraction for.\r  \n\r  \nShe broke up with her BF about 6 months ago, so I think that's a fair amount of time for me to \"make a move\" on her.\r  \n\r  \nAfter she broke up with her ex-bf, she started to hang out with our group more and more and that's when I took a liking to her.\r  \n\r  \nShe and I are kind of in a similar situation. She and her BF are \"broken up\" but they are still talking.\r  \n\r  \nI myself got out of a 6 year relationship 1 year ago and I am still talking to my ex-gf just like this girl in my friend group.\r  \n\r  \nI know that my ex-gf still has feelings for me, we broke up due to eternal forces and not because we wanted to. My ex-gf met this new girl while we were still together. If she found out that I asked this girl out, I'm afraid she would get hurt, both mentally and physically. When we broke up, she couldn't sleep for days and that led her to some mental health issues and she almost hurt herself pretty bad.\r  \n\r  \nI still care a lot for my ex-gf and want the best for her and do not want her to get hurt, but I feel like we're both stuck in limbo and neither one of us will move on if one of us do not take a step.\r  \n\r  \nI'm torn because I want to ask this girl out because I really do want to get to know her more and I don't want to be stuck in this limbo where neither me or my ex-gf is taking a step because we're both afraid to hurt each other.\r  \n\r  \nI have no idea if this girl even feels the same, but the reason I'm asking isn't to see if she does, I think the main reason I'm asking is because I just want to be able to take a step forward, I've been standing still for so long.",

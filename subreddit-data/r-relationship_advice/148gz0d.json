    "postText": "I\u2019ve never had a reason to go through my husband\u2019s phone in the almost 10 years that we\u2019ve been together. He\u2019s always been one to hand over his phone for anything that I would need it for, like a quick photo, phone call or Google search. \n\nLately, I\u2019ve had my suspicions, even though I could never put my finger on what was bothering me. He seemed to be staying out later, staying the bathroom longer, becoming less talkative with me, etc. \n\nHe had came home from golf around 9 PM the other day and went straight to bed. About an hour later, I got on his phone and opened his \u201cRecently Deleted\u201d texts after looking through all of his apps. \n\nAnd there it was: A topless photo from a woman that I recognize as being \u201cKelsey\u201d from back in high school, along with a highly sexual text thread. I took screenshots of everything and sent them to myself. \n\nKelsey was someone that has been in the same friend group as him forever. I\u2019ve met her several times at the golf course, the local bars, and friend\u2019s houses. She\u2019s also married with three small kids. \n\nI confronted him the next morning. I just flat out said, \u201cNice t!t picture on your phone!\u201d \n\nHe acted like I imagined he would. His mouth dropped open and he kind of smirked for a second. \n\nBecause I\u2019m so angry, I\u2019m paraphrasing a little bit. He said, \u201cLook, she\u2019s going through a divorce. I didn\u2019t ask for the picture. She just sent it and everything got out of control. It won\u2019t happen again, and I\u2019m going to block her. *I saw her at the golf course tonight, and she played with my group*.\u201d \n\n**That\u2019s perfect. They see each other at the course, play golf together in groups, get drunk at the bar, and then exchange sexual texts all night.**\n\nHowever, their text thread actually does back this up. They started out having a normal conversation, and then she randomly sends him the picture and asks if he wants more. He said that was \u201cgood\u201d and how she looks great. \n\nI don\u2019t think I would be as mad if this was a random person, but Kelsey has been around our family and children for years. I didn\u2019t know she was going through a divorce, as she kept it pretty under wraps. \n\nHe seems very apologetic and ashamed, especially seeing me so upset. I blocked her for him, but I don\u2019t know if that will help anything or make it worse. I still can\u2019t get the pictures and the texts out of my head. I thought about contacting her myself, although I don\u2019t want to draw any more attention to this. \n\nShould I confront Kelsey or just let it go? How do I move on from this? \n\nTL;DR: I found a topless photo on my husband\u2019s phone from a long-time female friend going through a divorce. I confronted him, and he seems to be remorseful. I don\u2019t know if I should talk to the other woman about this or ignore it.",

You won't be there and there will be plenty of alcohol. It only takes one time for him to be \"so drunk he made a mistake\". And what are the chances of you even finding out? He's an ass for entertaining her and now those highly sexual texts will give her a reason to continue flirting with him in person. He'll probably unblock her and just save her name under a different name since they are \"friends\" and \"can't avoid each other\".",

She would not intimidate me. And she would know I know. I'd go the first opportunity I got. You have nothing to be ashamed of.  I'm just so mad for you.\n\nIt needs to be addressed.

I heard that you started hanging around Sheila\u2019s husband too, I heard they were getting a divorce, you planning on taking her place and being step mommy to their 5 kids?  I would just go on with random things in a calm conversational manner and not react if she starts talking back or yelling.  If she moves places I\u2019d slowly move over to her again and keep asking questions.  I\u2019d mention that you saw her pictures and her left tit looks a little misshapen and she may want to see her doctor and get a mammogram done.  You also noticed a suspicious looking mole, I had a friend that had melanoma and the cancer spread to her bones and then to her brain and she didn\u2019t even recognize her kids for months before she died (true story, my friend passed at 36 and left 3 kids).\n\nI don\u2019t recommend doing the above but I would make my presence known, you have nothing to be ashamed of, just don\u2019t do anything so obnoxious that would get you kicked out.

Because if you don\u2019t and your husband simply tries to avoid her, she won\u2019t get the message and will keep on trying to reach out to your husband - this time in person. Let her know that you know, even if you\u2019re not friends. I would also caution the other women in your group of friends. Many people go through divorces, no one is flashing their boobs to other married men. \n\nAs for your husband - I understand this happened on the night before and you confronted him the next morning, so he probably didn\u2019t have much time to do much. But I think it wouldn\u2019t sit well with me if he hid something like this, even if I believed that he didn\u2019t mean to. \n\nThere are two kind of people who hide these things from their spouses - those who dont want to rock the boat and \u2018make their partner worry for no reason\u2019, and those who are not sure about the opportunity and are biding their time before they judge the viability of cheating (meaning they\u2019re not sure if Kelsey is serious about it). It is always a bad idea to hide it from your partner, because when it comes out - and it always comes out - it\u2019s impossible to justify why they hid it in the first place. So think about that too before you decide who to proceed with your husband",

It went on for years and it became a joke because it didn\u2019t matter what the weather was, Kevin was out golfing. Then there was a guy in a car parked down our street just watching their house. The husband of Kevin\u2019s girlfriend, they worked together, had hired a PI and was watching the house.  A few days later Kevin came home and told his wife that he didn\u2019t want to be a husband or father anymore and he moved out, bought a corvette and a Harley and rarely saw the kids.\n\nSo when you mentioned golfing I imagined all Kevin\u2019s golf outings except the only thing going in the hole wasn\u2019t a golf ball.  Do the other people that were in his group know about their little relationship because if they\u2019ve been sexting and seeing each other I find it hard to believe that they haven\u2019t been physical as they were playing\u2026just touching inappropriately most likely happened.\n\nFor me, them being together, the way your husband has been acting and the text thread I would be done.  It\u2019s cheating and if he\u2019s done it once he\u2019ll find better ways to hide it the next time.  If you\u2019re going to let him have this one time I would tell him that he needs to cut off that entire group of friends if she\u2019s part of it.  That any contact with her will be found out, no matter how hard he tries to hide it, it always comes out and the marriage is over.  He can choose her and that group of friends or you.\n\nDon\u2019t let him put any blame on you, and though she is in the wrong too, he decided to cheat as soon as he started replying to her.  If he doesn\u2019t want to decide pack a bag for him and tell him to stay with Kelsey because she was worth throwing away your marriage.",

She started talking to someone that she was interested in before we got together and when I confronted her she said \u201cI don\u2019t know why I reached out\u201d and she felt like she wasn\u2019t getting enough attention from me. She said she was so sorry and loves me so much couldn\u2019t picture her life without me blah blah, I caught her with a deleted message from that guy again this morning that was obvious that they had still been talking(she just got better at hiding it). Her response was that she hasn\u2019t been happy for months and feels like crap for lying and saying she was.\n\nThis is where it feels different for me. She started some new medicine a couple months ago when she first starting acting weird with me, so I have been holding onto hope the medicine was the driving reason why she was being this way. Now after months of catching little lies and her flipping back and forth saying she\u2019s happy then she\u2019s not I just don\u2019t know if I can move on from this stuff I feel like the trust is gone.\n\nI have always told her and myself that if I am in a relationship where I feel like I have to go through my spouses phone or worry about what they are doing that I would leave. It\u2019s a lot easier said than done. Honestly I don\u2019t really have any friends that I want to talk to about this because a piece of me is still hoping that the medicine is part of it. \nShe has never even so much as looked at somebody else in our 8 years before this. I am just heartbroken right now and don\u2019t know what to do. I know in my heart that she is going to regret this all but she seems so emotionless on this medicine. She has to take it for another month.",

She\u2019s known your husband since childhood, so she\u2019s been there when you met, married, had children, etc. That makes it so, so much worse. Anyone who has been that close, whether they are a friend to you directly or not, is a scavenging parasitic asshole for engaging in that manner with your husband. \n\nI honestly can\u2019t imagine being so disgusting I would interact with a family and then not hesitate to violate a couple in such a selfish and pathetic attempt to validate myself, even in the wake of divorce. \n\nThey both carry 100% of 50% of the blame. She doesn\u2019t get a pass. It appears she instigated it, and your husband should have shut that shit down immediately. I wouldn\u2019t trust them to be around each other right now.

You let every single person in your and your husbands friend group know what she did. If they let her stay in this friend group then they are not you or your husbands true friends. How you are being so passive in this situation is beyond me. Damage is done. It\u2019s going to get worse if you don\u2019t do something about it. Blocking her will do absolutely nothing. Good luck",

No need to blow it up especially when she's been around the family and the hearing rumor mill spinning if it's a small community.  I mean even she kept her own divorce secret (I guess we see why). \n\nUltimately you know that you can't stop him from doing what he wants to but you have full control over how you respond. I think the better question to pose is what you're going to do if/once this escalates....",

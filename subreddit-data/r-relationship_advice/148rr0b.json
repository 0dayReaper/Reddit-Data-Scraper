    "postText": "\nExactly as the title says. I have been dating this girl for 11 months. Things have always gone great. But I feel as if I have always been one foot threw the door in this relationship. Maybe I need to grow up a bit or something but I don\u2019t feel like I love her anymore. It\u2019s not just that the spark is gone like all of my love is gone. \n\nNow she is living at her family\u2019s second home (an hour away from her family\u2019s regular house) and working near me. I was going to breakup with her before but \u201cI was just waiting for the right time\u201d. I know it was dumb. But now I feel even more trapped \n\nSo my question is how do I breakup with her over something like this without absolutely destroying her?",

            "comment": "Breaking up with someone is a difficult and sensitive task, but it's important to be honest and considerate of both your own feelings and the other person's emotions. Here's a more expanded version of how to break up with someone without causing unnecessary pain:\r  \n\r  \nFirst, find a private and comfortable setting where you both can have an open conversation without distractions. It's crucial to give this discussion the time and space it deserves.\r  \n\r  \nWhen you start the conversation, be direct and honest. Explain that you have been feeling disconnected from the relationship and that, unfortunately, your feelings of love have changed. It's important to stress that this is a personal struggle you've been facing, and it's not a reflection of her worth or value as a person. Make it clear that your decision is based on your own emotional journey and the need to focus on personal growth.\r  \n\r  \nUsing \"I\" statements can help convey your feelings without placing blame on her. Instead of saying, \"You make me feel this way,\" say something like, \"I have been struggling with my own emotions and have come to realize that my feelings have changed.\" This approach helps to maintain a respectful and open conversation.\r  \n\r  \nIt's crucial to allow her the opportunity to express her emotions and react to the news. Be prepared for a range of responses, including sadness, anger, or confusion. Offer a listening ear and be empathetic throughout the conversation. Acknowledge her feelings and validate them without becoming defensive.\r  \n\r  \nWhile it may be tempting to offer false hope or reassurances, it's better to be clear and honest about your decision. It can be more damaging in the long run to give false expectations or keep someone in a relationship when your heart is no longer fully invested. Respect her and give her the opportunity to find someone who can reciprocate her feelings fully.\r  \n\r  \nAfter the breakup, it's important to respect her need for space and time to heal. Allow her to process the breakup in her own way and refrain from unnecessary contact unless it is necessary or mutually agreed upon.\r  \n\r  \nRemember, breaking up is not easy, and there may be pain involved for both parties. However, being honest, respectful, and considerate in your approach can help minimize the hurt and provide a foundation for healing and moving forward.",

She surprised me and she said yes, you're absolutely right, it's going to hurt them really badly. But they'll get over it. And so will you. It's just the facts. Breakups hurt. But it hurts more to string someone along, so go with your gut here and find some words to let her know that you feel that the relationship has run its course. You don't necessarily have to say that you don't love her, if that seems hurtful, know what I mean? But it's fair to say, hey I just don't feel like things are going to go any further with us. I don't want to string you along and things have been wonderful between us, but I think it's time to end this. Or whatever works for you to say. You can actually Google relationship breakup script and find some good ideas for communicating your feelings to end things.",

I spent my early adult years doing exactly What you outlined in this post dating someone, falling in love, falling out of love, and moving on once we break up and not understanding why. But it doesn't need to be this way. I read a book that changed my life and All of my relationships and If I can save you 8 years of your life of trying to learn this lesson that I learned from a book I would love to.

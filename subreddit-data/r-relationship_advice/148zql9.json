    "postText": "\n\nHere\u2019s some backstory for context. I\u2019ll get into the specifics and question in a moment. \n\nCast:\nHusband M/48\nMe F/38\nDaughter F/10\nSon M/4\nMy mom F/71\nMy dad M/76\n\n4 years ago my husband (married for 13 years and together for 15) and I moved across the country because he wanted our kids to be closer with his parents. We mutually chose a place about 3 hours south of them and close to his work\u2019s headquarters. 6 months later my folks brought up wanting to move closer to us so that I could have help when he\u2019s away at work for weeks at a time; plus they love their grandkids. My husband initially had a fit saying he didn\u2019t want them anywhere near us, but could never verbalize why.\n\nA few months after that the 5 acre lot next to us just happened to come up for sale. After talking with my husband about the fact that we couldn\u2019t afford it it suggested my parents buy it. They flew back a month before COViD and bought it. Building during COViD was a challenge and they lived in our 210sqft guesthouse with no issues. \n\nYesterday I had a lower back fusion a L5-S1. It was done from both the front and the back\u2026 so I have one incision on my lower abdomen and two at the base of my spine. The surgery was a success even though the surgeon said the damage was as more extensive than he was expecting so it took 5.5 hours instead of 3. My husband stayed overnight at the hospital with me. I was cleared to come home this afternoon. \n\nWe had made the decision to temporarily move my husband, myself, and the two kids into my parents house because they have an electric bed that raises so I don\u2019t have to push myself up and cause pain. Also, my husband will be leaving for work on Thursday for three weeks and no one thought it would be a good idea for the woman hopped up on painkillers to stay alone with two kids. \n\nWell, while I was laying down and expecting everyone to be rational apparently drama ensued that has resulted in my spouse saying he\u2019ll never step foot under my parent\u2019s roof again. \n\nHe and my daughter went to our house without telling anyone or taking a phone from 5-8:30. When he got back my mom asked him (I did hear this conversation though not all the way awake) to please keep her in the loop next time because what if they had needed his help with me or the youngest kid. My husband apparently didn\u2019t take kindly to this and later told me he\u2019s almost 50 and not a child to be controlled and told when and where he should be. \n\nIncident #2 happened when he took two of the three dogs outside and was talking on the phone (don\u2019t know whom to). My dad let the dogs in and didn\u2019t realize my husband was still outside (deaf 76 year old who refuses to wear hearing aids). When he sees my husband rattle the knob he tries to get up and open the door, but the man has poofed. \n\nIt\u2019s now 9pm and neither child is asleep. I take one look at my daughter and grab a thermometer. Her temp is 103.2. Have an ibuprofen since I can\u2019t find Tylenol. Oh look the four year old boy is wondering around. Everyone to bed. As I\u2019m singing them to sleep my husband calls my dad and asks to talk to me (please remember I have three holes in my body and am using a cane while on three different drugs). \n\nHe starts going off about how he was locked out intentionally and my parents are keeping him from me and the kids so he\u2019s coming to get us all and we will all just stay at our house. I said no. The kids are settled. I also mentioned that my dad had intentionally left the garage door open for him, and that I\u2019d like him to be my support person for meds tonight. He refuses and hangs up. I mutter a few choice words under my breath and my son asks why dad\u2019s voice sounded weird on the phone. Kids fall asleep and I hobble back to the electric bed. \n\nI wait for 20 minutes and text my husband to see if he wants to talk. Last year I took \u201cCrucial Conversations\u201d. It\u2019s a class that talks about letting people tell their story and finding out how to put rationality into the narrative without dragging in emotion. So I asked my husband what his story was for why my parents locked him out. \u201cTo keep me away so they can help you.\u201d I followed up with: \u201cWhy would they do that?\u201d His response: \u201ci don\u2019t know, but they did. If they hadn\u2019t I wouldn\u2019t be down here. Your mom just wants control.\u201d\n\n(Note: my mom has had three vein ablutions in the past week so she can\u2019t really walk right now, plus has other health issues). \n\nI told him there was no reason they would want to look him out and that I had asked and it was an honest mistake. He started ranting and swearing and \u201ccalling the BS flag because it was intentional!\u201d He then went as far to ask me (who is less than 24 hours out from surgery!) if we needed to start talking about custody arrangements. The heck?! We\u2019ve never mentioned divorce. \n\nI asked him if he was asking me to choose between him or my folks. He didn\u2019t want to answer. \n\nI\u2019m heartbroken right now and obviously emotionally and physically in pain. I know they say if someone shows you who they are to believe them. I know my husband has had anger issues in the past. No, he has never physically or verbally been abusive. I am not financially dependent on him. \n\nWe are going to have a deep discussion tomorrow without anyone else around. He has two options from my view (which is where I\u2019m asking for advice): 1 - we find a marriage counselor and he finds a personal therapist to work stuff out with. 2 - we start divorce proceedings. \n\nCustody would be pretty simple. He can keep the house. I\u2019ll live there with the kids for 3 weeks while he\u2019s at work; then move to my parents for the three he\u2019s home and he can have the kids full time then. I\u2019ll keep my car that\u2019s in my name and he can keep his truck. I will stay on his insurance until the end of the year. He will be removed from mine. The kids will stay double enrolled. The dog is mine and he will have no access to her. The cat is the kid\u2019s. I will maintain the chickens, but I want paid for my time and eggs. I will not stick groceries for his time off. \n\nAm I blowing this out of proportion? Are the drugs talking? Am I making sense? I need some outside perspective.",

With the information you\u2019ve shared, you\u2019re making a lot more sense after a big surgery than him. He says he\u2019s almost 50, but he\u2019s acting like he\u2019s almost 5.\n\nI think your terms are absolutely on point.\n\nMy only doubt is if there\u2019s any sensible reason for the obvious dislike your husband has for your parents. Apparently there\u2019s none, but this is coming from you, their daughter. If you are objectively certain there\u2019s nothing that merits his reaction, then go ahead as planned.",

                    "comment": "Exactly. I can\u2019t be wholly objective because they are my folks. From my perspective they\u2019ve always gone above and beyond trying to respect our boundaries and/or helping us out. Whereas his folks are opposite; especially in terms of economic help. He has a lot of anger that he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable with expressing to his parents because they refuse to accept that one of his big brothers SA\u2019d him as a child. They also massively undersold their property to another of the 6 kids after having written in their will they everyone was getting 2 acres and their daughter would be the house and the additional 6 acres. \n\nI will admit that my mom can be bossy at times. She\u2019s a hover parent and so is my husband. I think their personalities clash, but they throw me in the middle and refuse to talk to each other. I\u2019m just feeling done. I\u2019m supposed to be recovery and sleeping and instead I\u2019m obsessing and crying and researching counselors and divorce attorneys.",

He may even transferring his anger towards his parents onto yours, who knows. \n\nAmong all this chaos, don\u2019t forget you had a successful surgery and be very careful of not screwing your recuperation up.",

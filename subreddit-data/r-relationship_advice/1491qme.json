    "postText": "I found out my partner was looking at porn site, it upset me and at the time he yelled at me and blamed me. It made me feel like he chose it over me because of that reaction. He literally said it was my fault. I make no effort ( I was studying at the time and he wasn't helping me with childcare or anything so I admit I gave up with him, I had no energy for him) . But I started to make effort, sent tons of photos, tried to have sex alot. He constantly says no to sex. And I found again he was looking, I was really hurt. He promised not to look again, now deletes his history except I've figured out how to find deleted history. And well, even this morning he was on there. I feel really hurt. I wish I didn't care about this site. I just can't help feel insecure, if I dress up or send photos it doesn't seem enough compared to looking at random women online. When we go out, every single average or above average woman he stares at but won't notice me putting effort in. If I say anything he denies looking and says he doesn't notice because I always \"look good\". I don't understand the oggling then. I feel like I'm being messed around emotionally.",

Challenge him to cut it out for a day, 2 days, 3 days. If he's able to cut that daily lure, it may help draw him out further.\n\nBest of luck.",

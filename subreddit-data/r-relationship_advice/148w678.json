    "postText": "Hi. My friends with benefits and I have been seeing each other for 4 months now. At the start she said she didn\u2019t want anything more than a fwbs cuz she wanted to explore and cuz she wasn\u2019t over her ex. I agreed to this even though I was looking for a relationship. One day I was telling her how I\u2019m sad that no one has romantic feelings for me  and she said she would like me but she had already decided we were fwbs. A few months ago also she told me she likes me but doesn\u2019t want to be with me. It\u2019s been amazing it\u2019s been so so much fun!\nMore fun than I\u2019ve ever had in a relationship. However now we have a weird dynamic and my therapist claims we are in a relationship but she (my fwb) just doesn\u2019t know it. I don\u2019t know what we are and really need advice on how to take this forward. Basically she and I have turned into the best of friends (with benefits). We text all day long and see each other 4-6 times a week. If I don\u2019t respond to her text for a day she\u2019ll text me again or send me something that reminds her of me. She has introduced me to all her friends and knows all my friends and makes and effort and wants them to like her. Whenever we\u2019re in public dancing etc she grinds on me and sometimes kisses me. We were apart for a month cuz I was travelling and the day I got back she took a day off of work to see me (she said she\u2019s just tired and all her friends are home so she wants me over. These are kind of like mixed signals to me. \nI used to think I really like her and I do but I don\u2019t know if I see a future with her (like marriage and kids I know I\u2019m young but still) maybe just cause she doesn\u2019t want one with me. I am just really confused cuz she keeps reiterating we are just fwbs but we can\u2019t go a day without interaction which doesn\u2019t even happen w my best friend. This is really stressing me for some reason. \nI\u2019m scared this will hurt when it ends but I\u2019m having the time of my life. Should I end it because it stresses me out or stay on cuz I enjoy it?",

            "comment": "Before doing anything I'd recommend being transparent and explaining your feelings. Basically tell her all the things you said in this post about the mixed signals and why it is confusing and stressing you out as well as how you've come to feel about her. It wouldn't hurt to ask if she could ever see you as more than a fwb. Honestly i wouldnt be surprised if she said yes but if she says no then it'd be best to end it. I know you say you enjoy it but the more you engage in \"relationship-like\" things with her, the more you'll desire something more official with her and the less fun it'll be. Youll probably want to end it before it gets to that point. Best of luck :)",

    "postText": "I came home from work early (I'm an OB nurse so my hours are pretty unpredictable) and found female sneakers in the garage that weren't mine. At that point, I sort of already knew what I'd be walking into. My husband has recently become very fit and has been consistently going to the gym, during which he made a female friend who he even brought home for dinner last week. She's beautiful and thin and everything I am not, which instantly made me feel horrible. So, I talked to him about it. He encouraged me to build my confidence and reassured me he loved me and would always be loyal to me.\n\nI walked into the laundry room from the garage and sort of tiptoed around the house before going upstairs. They were having sex. In our bed. With a framed picture from our wedding above the nightstand next to it. I silently left the room and got back in my car with tears streaming down my face and drove to get food and just sat in my car crying since. Its now almost 1am (walked in on them at 7pm) and I've returned to the hospital. He called me asking why I wasn't home and I told him my shift is extended but in reality, I'm laying in one of the on call rooms bawling my eyes out as I type this.\n\nI feel so worthless and ugly and stupid. I don't even know how to proceed. On one hand I want to divorce him and never see him again, but on the other hand, I'm an ugly woman....its not like I can do better. I just want to die. I feel so gross and the self-loathing is getting too much right now. Advice please.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the kind comments and support. Please stop commenting, however. I think I've heard just about everything (including some horrible things about my weight). I don't care about \"internet points\" or whatever and the notifications are getting crazy. Reading through these comments has been a nice way to keep myself sane these past few hours. I still have no idea what I am going to do and I know everyone wants me to leave, but a marriage is more than can be illustrated with a couple of words on a website. He was a great husband and I can't help but feel at fault for neglecting myself weight-wise. I don't know if I will stay, but that's all I really know right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did and while I'm incredibly grateful for all the nice and supportive comments...please please please stop messaging me about how I should stop eating or laugh at me for expecting a faithful husband while being overweight. It is incredibly upsetting and I am already going through a lot. I feel I need to clarify since everyone seems to care that I had food after I found out. I had been working a shift from 7am to 6:30pm during which I had been all over the place. I had lunch at 11am and nothing else until I left. I was starving and hurt and driving around with tears streaming down my face. Please stop harassing me about that.",

It must be horrible to find out in person that your partner is cheating on you. \n\nHowever, if you consider that there were so many steps involved and that had the opportunity to refrain from cheating on you every second along the way, you might see that he did it with full intention. \n\nIt is totally up to you how you react to this.

I've had it happen to me three times (including my first wife).\n\nThat said:\n\nHim cheating is not on you, your weight, anything. Period. Everything else aside, that is purely him. If he really felt that he was unhappy and wanted someone else, he should have left first. There is zero excuse for cheating.\n\nAnd to be brutally honest, that would have happened regardless of your weight. Loyalty isn't conditional - it's either there or not. (Edit: to be clear, since there's disagreement below, in this context by loyalty I simply mean whether someone will cheat or not)\n\nYou can definitely do better. Not even getting into the self-esteem part, it's not going to be too hard to find better than a cheater.\n\nAs for your weight, I see people over your weight in happy relationships all the time. There are people that will find you attractive. If nothing else, I'd look at it this way: you will screen out the superficial candidates that only care about your weight.\n\nAs for attractiveness in general, every person finds different things attractive. It's important to recognise that it's not that you aren't attractive: you may not find yourself attractive, but you're not trying to date yourself, so that's irrelevant.\n\nSelf-esteem is good, and I would work on that, but you don't control what other people think. You can't stop them from liking how you look, just by not liking it yourself.",

I broke up with my long term boyfriend a year and a half ago (amicably, with minimal trauma lol) and I\u2019ve been asked out quite a few times since then, been on my fair share of casual dates. But god, Ive been putting off anything more serious because it\u2019s actually been pretty damn nice to be alone for awhile! I don\u2019t have to mediate or consider anyone else\u2019s preferences, I just do what I like! I get to see my friends more often and do stupid friend shit like sleepovers! Also ladies, bonus: haven\u2019t shaved my legs since October, since I don\u2019t really care what the one-nighters think of my pelt lol and I wear pants to work. I went on a cleaning spree at three am last night just because I felt like it and didn\u2019t have to worry about disturbing anybody. I got a cat that I couldn\u2019t get before because he was deathly allergic. Life wasn\u2019t bad with him, I don\u2019t mean to give that impression, but it\u2019s cettainly not at all bad *without* him either. (I\u2019m sure he feels the same way about me lol.)\n\n\nHonestly more people should try being alone for a significant while between relationships. It\u2019s awesome. Too many people think something is \u2018wrong with them\u2019 or they\u2019ll be judged if they don\u2019t have an SO. I say fuck \u2018em and do what you like. ",

I mean, I don't know you, but here is what I have for evidence:\n\n* Your husband reassured you when you initially talked to him about her.  People don't do this for bitchy assholes.  Something *inside* of you was valuable enough for him to want to respond with kindness, even if in the end he succumbed to temptation.\n* You are a nurse.  You work to help others.  You may save lives (I don't know; I have no idea what role you have in your job, but benefit of the doubt).\n* When you found out, you didn't go crazy-woman violent throwing things or throwing his stuff on the lawn and setting it on fire, etc.  What did you do?  You went somewhere safe, cried and allowed your emotions to register, and now you are asking for advice.\n\nCan you not see how... fucking *reasonable* and *awesome* you are?  Like, you handle yourself WELL.  The fact that you're crying doesn't diminish this.  You are allowed to cry.  It's serious.  It's warranted.\n\nI think you might be really beautiful.  You may just need to find a person who values beauty of character, instead of something only skin deep.",

You don't have to say a word to your husband, but if you decide to - don't do it on the phone. Send him a text or email saying that you need space. Ask him to not contact you and let him know you'll contact him when you're ready. And then turn off your phone. \n\nHe fucked up. He doesn't get to decide when you talk now. You can take as much time as you need to think, rest, and get your emotions in order. \n\nI'm sorry about the dirtbag.

So my aunt was surprised and imagined the guy must really be a gem of a person to pull someone like that.\n\nSo recently she started showing up on her own and it seems they broke up. What happened? The guy had been cheating on her.\n\nSo yea, the moral is looks have nothing to do with it.\nBe strong and you can definitely do better, than with a cheating bastard.",

You can do better. \n\nEdit: \n\n1. It doesn\u2019t matter what the relationship is like if you can\u2019t be an adult and end it rather than cheat you\u2019re in the wrong. \n\n2. If you cheat you don\u2019t love your partner. Point blank. Some of these answers make me really pity any woman/man that gets into a relationship with anyone with this mindset. \n\n3. I said a person cheating isn\u2019t cheating on their spouse solely based on looks alone. So I\u2019ll r/EILI5 it for you.

His wife, btw is working long hours in a very demanding environment. \n\nNow I don't know what was his actual intentions to bring that slutty friend home to show his wife, but there's nothing good there. To what? Show off? Make his wife motivated by bringing her self esteem down? Or to pre-warn her of his cheating ways? I don't know\n\nThen he proceeds to do the physical deed no long after, while his wife was at work. On their bed, no less. I can't even describe how disgusted I am because these actions were so calculated and deliberate. So callous and selfish. And for what? All to boost his own fragile shitty ego. Instead of working with OP as a team, he abandoned AND  betrayed her every way possible. \n\nOP, I'm not sure what you will do with the marriage after witnessing such despicable behaviour. But remember you always have a choice. You are young with many great qualities and I'm sure you are beautiful too even if you don't think so right now. \n\nStay strong and focused on healing. It's not a matter of finding someone better (which is really not a difficult thing to do). It is that even on your own you can shine. Good luck and take care.

            "comment": "I have been there! I was you in my 20\u2019s. My ex husband met a girl doing a newfound hobby of his. He said was just a \u201cfriend.\u201d I was naive and believed him. When I met her a couple weeks later, she came to our home for a bbq. Sat at my table, ate off my dishes, ate food I worked hard to prepare to impress her and the other few friends he had over - thinking she was just a friend. \n\nHe would talk about her but I had a much different image of her in my mind based on his description. When I saw her I was shocked. In my eyes, at that time, she looked so beautiful and it made me feel so fat and unattractive - even though I wasn\u2019t. But jealousy does some weird shit to your brain and you start to compare every little thing. \n\nI will never forget the day that I got a call from the daycare center saying that our son was running a fever. This was pre cell phones. I tried calling him at work, and his coworkers said he left early that day. I called the house phone, no answer. In my gut, I just knew.\n\nWith a little detective work, I found out where she lived (I worked for a company where I could find certain basic information out).  After I picked up our son, I decided to drive by her house. There was his truck, parked out front. My heart sunk. I took our son home, and threw up. I started comparing myself to this woman, who I thought was so perfect at the time. \n\nHe came home later, and was shocked to see me there. I guess he was hoping to shower before I got home. I asked him where he had been, he said he had a busy afternoon at work. Our son was crying because he was sick, I was crying. I didn\u2019t tell him why just yet. I think he just assumed I was crying because our son was sick.\n\nShe invited him (us?) to a cookout the following weekend. I told him I suspected something was off. He denied, denied, denied. I went the following weekend to observe, and he kept feeding me drinks while I was there. There were a lot of people, and I was talking to someone when I noticed both of them had disappeared. I walked back to \u201cgo to the bathroom\u201d and \u201caccidentally\u201d opened the wrong doors. I found her room, and there he was, going down on her. She looked right at me, I shut the door, walked out, and walked down the road to the gas station, called my friend to come get me and give me a ride home. \n\nEventually he came somewhat clean with what he couldn\u2019t deny, but based on all the pieces I put together I knew I was only getting half truths. My self-esteem was so low, I decided to try and forgive him. I never trusted him again, with good reason. And I couldn\u2019t ever unsee that. \n\nA couple years later, it happened again, with another woman. It took me 20 years to leave that asshole because I didn\u2019t work on my self-esteem like I should have.\n\nI have a man now who tells me how beautiful he thinks I am every single day. I\u2019m not perfect. I\u2019m not super skinny, blonde with fake boobs. Out of curiosity one day, I looked that woman up on Facebook and she is horribly unattractive. \n\nAny woman who would come into your home, eat food that you thoughtfully prepared, isn\u2019t beautiful. YOU are beautiful and YOU deserve so much better. Pack his shit, find a good counselor and work on your self-esteem. You deserve to be happy. I\u2019m sorry your hurting. There is so much better out there for you!",

It doesn't suddenly give him rights to cheat, or suddenly make it any less morally reprehensible that he did.\n\nHe had so many options here that didn't involve cheating, if he had a problem with a lack of attraction to you. And any lack of attraction to you is his personal view.\n\nSo... the only thing stopping you from leaving this cheater in the dirt is your own negative view of yourself. For one, not a healthy reason to stay with someone no matter what. But I'm sure you already know that. In any situation, it's best you change that negative view - whether you remain with him, or you carry on without him. \n\nWhether improving your view of yourself comes through getting fitter yourself, or simply learning how to be kinder about how you currently look (or anything else you feel you want to do, to feel better). The journey to do that will be a lot easier without having to bother with him, and having someone who can do this to you make you feel beaten down. \n\nYou will always remember he did this to you, no matter where you go from here. Even if it stopped being a source of you hating how you look, the emotional blow will hit you so hard if you decide to stay. You'll look at him and always know he didn't respect or love you enough to refrain from this, even if you're standing there in a year or two skinny and fit yourself.\n\nYou deserve better than a cheater, and I firmly believe you *can* do much better than a cheater too. *Just as you are*. Leave him.",

            "comment": "My older sister works as an aged care nurse and a few other family members work as actual nurses in hospitals, one is even a special nurse who works with abused kid. I'm saying this because I want you to know how amazing of a person you have to be to work in those jobs. You have to have thw right temperment, kindness, empathy, understanding, strength, smarts ... Every positive trait you can think of and the fact that you do that for a living, already makes you an attractive person. Regardless of looks or weight. Working any job where you help others automatically makes you an attractive individual.\n\nNow the second reason I pointed it out is because you probably work shift work. Meaning you work your ass off, don't have much down time, even to sleep let alone eat healthy nonstop and work out. My family members in that field are lucky if they even get enough time to pee or eat a small snack during a shift. So the fact that you do not have time to spend hours at the gym or whatever is completely understandable and the fact that he took advantage of your hectic full on work cycle just shows how shitty of a person he truely is.\n\nThis has nothing to do with the type of person you are. It is 100% to do with the type of dumpster fire of a \"man\" he is. He did this. Not you. I want you to remember that. It isn't your fault in any way and you should not take the blame. I know thats hard but it's true.\n\nYou need to sleep, somewhere he isn't. Somewhere safe and comfortable. Possibly a good friend or maybe your parents place. Sleep when you have a broken heart is so important. I know youll wake up wishing it wasnt real and feel sick but you need too. Then you need to message him and say you will speak to him when YOU are ready. He has no power anymore. He isn't your husband anymore, he is the asshole who slept with some rando in your marriage bed. Then possible stop by home when he isnt there and grap some of your own stuff and spend some time elsewhere thinking and trying to heal a little. \n\nAfter that, its your choice what steps to take next. Whether divorce or so on. But as of right now you need rest and to realise you are an attractive person and that him cheating had nothing to do with who you are as a person, but infact shows who he truely is and that he is the ugly one.\n\nSending love from Australia. \u2764\u2764",

It will surely take a while to get over this, but look to the future. Cheating to me is always a horribly wonderful gift because even though it absolutely crushes your soul, it gives you the right excuse to get out of a relationship with a terrible person. However ugly you think you are, I guarantee you aren't.

But it very much sounds as if you have low self confidence about your appearance, and when someone in a marriage feels like that it's often the result of many years of belittling or lack of support. I'd bet you are way, way more attractive than you give yourself credit for.\n\nSecondly, your husband does NOT deserve you. Some couples can get over cheating, many cannot, but for me... him fucking someone in your bed, that he's brought to dinner with you, with your photo in the room... that right there demonstrates that not only is he an utter, utter piece of shit, but completely undeserving of forgiveness. Not to mention his 'assurance' that you have nothing to worry about just days before. People like that just don't change.\n\nMy advice to you would be to get him out of your life asap. I would also assume someone that manipulative / dishonest will react very badly to being called out; so if you take that step, I'd do as much in secret as possible. Don't feel like you're being dishonest in that respect, he has shown that he cannot be trusted and therefore should not be given the consideration you probably usually offer people.\n\nI'm really sorry you've had to go through this. Please reach out to a trusted friend and / or family as soon as you can so you're not sat crying alone. You will benefit from support right now so make sure you get some.",

I moan and miss the days of being skinny and therefore having no reason for someone to not like me, because I equated my weight and thinness with **all** of my worth. Not the straight As I made, not the things I would create, not the friends I had - because my skinny stole all of those things from me: my good grades came from me thinking analytically all of the time, my creativity diminished from said thinking analytically/about food all of the time, and my friends loved me because I was thin rather than because I was me. I was never to enjoy any of my things.\n\nI seemed like the perfect success story - I thought. Now I look back and realize how fake all of that success was, because I was never happy. I knew enough then to cry in front of my mirror feeling trapped, and yet couldn\u2019t get out; now that I was out, I wanted back in. But I\u2019ve finally gotten to a place to realize - I\u2019m free! Things I get are mine, because they come from me. And all that time - people may have actually simply liked *me*, through and without care of my weight. It\u2019s terrifying for me to think I can even achieve things by myself, but I\u2019m starting to trust and risk more.\n\nAlllllll of this is to say - skinny isn\u2019t everything, and it isn\u2019t equal to beauty. Skinny can be very lonely, and it can be wrapped in a miserable life. Beauty, on the other hand, is more intangible and therefore powerful than that. You are an OB nurse, which proves not only that you\u2019re smart (**yes you are!**), but also that you\u2019re compassionate, care about life, and are willing to take on risks to help people in a very vulnerable time in their life. **YOU. ARE. SO. BEAUTIFUL!**\n\nAnd with this, I\u2019m just remembering I was cheated on while skinny, so that\u2019s not the issue. Weight isn\u2019t the issue. Your husband disrespecting you and lying to you is the issue. It may feel easier to shift the blame to yourself because that\u2019s more in control, but it would be a misfire. Because you are radiant and spectacular and don\u2019t deserve any hate, especially from yourself.\n\nI have now learned and accepted that I am beautiful as I am, whether I like it or not, trust it or not, sorry, it\u2019s there. And so are you. It can be a little scary to dare believe it, but once I did I began to feel so much stronger because I climbed over the mountain of bullshit I believed to get there ;) I hope you can, too, and am reaching out my hand to help get you there.",

    "postText": "Hi ! \nI'm a 22 year old young man and after years of trying to get over her (22 also), I'm starting to question if I can move on. \nWe met when we were 13 or 14. We had ups and downs, but around 17 we were kinda together, its complicated. She was my first love..\nAnd I haven't seen her in almost a year but the thought of her still lingers in my mind. \n\nAnyways here's my problem. I'm a musician, and I started writing songs around the time i was falling for her. And I kept writing songs ever since. Many of my songs are about her. And I would say my best songs are about her (She has no idea I wrote these songs). And these past years I tried to look for love, you know, go out more, speak to women and I've made friends I guess.  And I have written songs about these little sparks of love I've felt for other women. And recently I haven't been able to write anything I deemed even worthy of a voice memo. Until tonight. At 2 am. I felt really down tonight, lonely. So I thought I'd just grab my acoustic and play some chords it usually helps. Then melody and words came to me and I sang \"it's been so long I know, I should have moved on, but here's another song about you\". And this got me spiraling down memory lane. I looked at pictures of her, haven't done that in so long. And although I can paint her face in my mind, actually seeing her lit something within me.\n\nAnd now I'm thinking. What if I arranged something with our friends. Last time I saw her was at a picnic we had last year. And as she left she did kiss me on the cheek, that was sweet now that I think of it. We could do the same this year? A picnic, this time I'll have my guitar and I'll just sing one of the songs, and hopefully she tells me to fuck off so I can get some freaking closure. Or do I send her a song I wrote? I need to know if she still thinks of me. Because apparently she still takes a lot of space in my little heart.",

    "postText": "\nAITA. Me and my fianc\u00e9 have been together for five years and have two kids together. We have struggled financially for a few years but now my fianc\u00e9 got this new job recently that is really good for us financially as the pay is quite high. I never ask him for anything besides maybe getting the kids a drink or changing a nappy every now and again. His overtime pay is really high and he wanted to do a lot of overtime and keep the money for himself, which is fine. But then he said he didn\u2019t want overtime all the time so I suggested that I could maybe get a job for the weekends so I feel like I\u2019m contributing financially to the family but he told me no because his job will pay more but without the overtime pay we are pretty well off so it\u2019s not really needed. So the biggest reason for me wanting my own job is because I feel as though my mental health would really benefit from me having something outside of the house where I get a break from the craziness I deal with everyday. He doesn\u2019t like the idea and I suggested that if I can\u2019t have a job that maybe we could split any earnings from his overtime to which he agreed but is saying he will only do that if he has to do nothing around the house and I take care of his work clothes being cleaned and his lunches being made everyday.   He expects me to wash and dry his work clothes and prepare his lunches everyday. Now we have two kids who are a real handful and he knows how stressed I am every single day being the only one at home with them. I cook, clean, pay all the bills, organise shopping, do all the washing, clean the dishes and get up every morning at 5:30am with both kids etc. He wants me to also wash, dry and fold his work clothes everyday and make his lunches everyday but I\u2019ve told him that I have enough on my plate already to which his response was \u201cI go to work for you, the least you could do is those two things for me\u201d like I don\u2019t do enough for him already and his job doesn\u2019t require much effort as he\u2019s told me everyday he just spends his day doing very little and sitting and talking to other people. Instead of him just offering to help he went straight in for an argument about it and refused to help. Now he\u2019s said I no longer make him happy and he\u2019s leaving me. He started bringing up alsorts in the argument to try and make me feel bad and he has a habit of belittling me and calling me stupid if I say something he doesn\u2019t like in the argument. He\u2019s now gone to work and has said he\u2019s packing a bag and staying elsewhere and still dragging stuff up from nowhere and throwing it in my face. I feel as though I was well within my rights to ask for him to do those two jobs because I do every other job you could think of. He\u2019s saying this is my job and that I\u2019m not doing it properly by asking for a little bit of help. I have no support system as I don\u2019t have any family that speak to me anymore due to them being toxic so I cut them off. I feel like everything was going fine until I asked for help from him and now I feel awful and guilty for asking instead of just doing it without complaining. I really don\u2019t know what to do from this point. Am I really the problem here?",

There\u2019s multiple scenarios where there is a worker bee and a home bee that works but this does not sound like a compatible and consensual situation. You have already outlined you would like to work for your own well-being. That should be supported not manipulated. Do it now. Go get some routine and financial clout. Feel good about what you. Ring to the table. You may come to a realisation of what is better for you and your children. If someone is saying they want to leave, do not beg them to stay. Or alternatively you may think being a home/housewife was the easiest route. You need to decide but I think you already know. Good luck.",

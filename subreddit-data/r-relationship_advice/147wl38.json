    "postText": "I have a question for all of you since I figure I'm still questioning this till this day. \nI had a relationship with my ex husband for 2 years before we got married but than got divorced 2 years later. \nHowever as the title says during the entirety of the relationship he would almost never allow me to touch his genitals or give him a bj without a condom on. The questionable part is that intercourse was no problem!\nAt first I didn't really say anything about it because he seemed so closed off about it but later on he revealed that he was worried he might have HPV hence why he didn't want me to touch him without a barrier (again intercourse was fine???!!!) as soon as he revealed this I forced him to get tested which all came back clean. \n\nBut the behavior remained! I tried talking about it with him a couple times afterward and tried to get rid of any of his worries and make him understand that it was absolutely okay to not use a condom anymore for those reasons but he kept persisting. \n\nWe're divorced now (for absolutely unrelated reasons) and I've never really managed to get an answer to my questions so I'm curious what you guys think of this behavior. Why do you think he might have been so dead set on acting like that? Particularly because while intercourse was fine but the rest was a no go? \n\nLet me know your theories and or thoughts, much appreciated in advance.\n\nEDIT: the title should have been ex-husband \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

Could be OCD. Sounds like it a little bit because extreme health worries is one symptom for many who suffer from OCD. The worries usually don't make sense and the people who suffer from it might create weird behaviours to help ease their fears. It is common to create very weird scenarios up in their head about how they could catch some disease and then they will try to avoid it to a point of obsession. To an outsider it might look like bizarre and unexplained behaviour because the fears don't make sense usually and are focused on highly unlikely scenarios that the sufferer cannot stop thinking about. I think him wanting to wear the condom all the time was related to his anxiety. For some reason he didn't extend the logic to intercourse.",

If you give into lust you sin and go to hell. \n\nThese type of people are also like; I got a bj and I liked it I\u2019m going to hell.

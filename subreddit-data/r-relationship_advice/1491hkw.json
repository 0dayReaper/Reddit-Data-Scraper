    "postText": "I have been together with my girlfriend since over 1 year now. In the beginning we had a very healthy sexual relationship. Until like January she started to have this weird pain and bleedings when we were having sex. \n\nShe went to the doctor and he gave her some disturbing news namely that he found some 'bad cells' in her cervix and that she had to get treatment for that. That was around March. Since then we have had no sexual intercourse and, she says, she's been seeing the doctor. I asked her if I could come with her once just once because she is very closed up about it. But she prefers me not to, she feels uncomfortable about these kind of things.\n\nThis had had a big impact on me as my primary sign of love is affection. I must say apart from the sexual part she is sweet and shows she cares about me. But from the moment I start about the medical condition, I only get a few words. I'm getting a bit paranoia tbh. I even think she lies about it. \n\nI'm aware this is sexual frustration, but I wouldn't be as frustrated if she would tell me more about what's going on. \n\nHow do I approach her on this topic while not making her uncomfortable?",

Just don't force her and try to not make it seem like you are only asking because y'all aren't having sex.",

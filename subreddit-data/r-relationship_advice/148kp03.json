    "postText": "Hello people of Reddit! :) \n\nRecently I wasn\u2019t invited to a wedding my boyfriend of 8 months went to because of the sleeping arrangement situation. That is understandable because we aren\u2019t married and I am glad I have the answer as to why I was not invited. Something is bothering me though :/ I was informed about the wedding and it was mentioned but I wasn\u2019t invited but what really hurt my feelings is knowing that my boyfriend didn\u2019t want me there. I\u2019m stuck on the thought of \u201cif he wanted me there he would have invited me\u201d I understand the sleeping arrangements but I\u2019m sure if he informed the people he was staying with they could have said \u201cyes we have room for her\u201d or \u201cno we don\u2019t\u201d and he could have communicated that with me. I know we aren\u2019t going to do everything together but again I am stuck on the thought of \u201cif he wanted to include me he would have\u201d :/ any thoughts on how I should cope with this feeling?? Thanks in advance",

He had mentioned he was going to a wedding sometime in May and The way I found out about the wedding was 2 weeks ago where he actually gave me a date, and location of where this wedding was taking place but that was it. He also said it was because I work but My job is lenient and I can take off as long as I give them 2 weeks or week and a half notice .",

I don't have a lot of experience with wedding planning, but I know that sometimes the lists are set in stone pretty early on, so if everything had been finalized before you met or shortly after, he might not have felt it was appropriate to ask them to accommodate another person.\n\nI do however think the whole thing is a little fishy. The biggest red flag is that he made decisions for you, e.g. just assuming you couldn't come because of your work, when he didn't know that and hadn't even asked you about it.\n\nHis other excuses don't really hold water either. Sure the grandma doesn't want you sleeping in the same bed, but he wasn't staying with her, and he never asked if there was a separate bed or room that you could have used.",

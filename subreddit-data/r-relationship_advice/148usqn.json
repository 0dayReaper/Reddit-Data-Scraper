    "postText": "I\u2019ve been with my bf for a year and a half. I love him, I truly and honestly do. But the more we go on, the bigger this problem becomes. And the more I feel resentful. He has a communication system that is fully dysfunctional. He basically tells me nothing in his life unless I ask specifically and dig for it myself. And this bugs me because he exhibits emotions in non verbal ways that make me question why he\u2019s upset and is it because of me etc. \n\nRecently, I learned that his mom passed 3 months ago. He didn\u2019t tell me, I found out accidentally. Now I do remember in hindsight he was particularly emotionally absent, and now it makes sense. He was grieving. This kind of thing makes me question wtf I\u2019m doing in this relationship. I hate to make such a tragedy about me, but I can\u2019t help it. He can\u2019t tell me basic things that are meant to be shared. He loved his mom and talked about her sometimes (when I asked him). So how come he didn\u2019t tell me when she DIED? And this goes on for many other things. I can\u2019t be there for him if he won\u2019t let me, and I can\u2019t feel peace knowing I\u2019m not there for the person I love. So\u2026 what\u2019s left for me?",

Are you sure you're even in a relationship?  This is NOT normal at all.  If he's not willing to see a professional, you should move on.  This is not what a relationship is.",

    "postText": "This is a tough pill to swallow, and I can't say I hadn't been warned. [This is my previous post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g8d98r/wife_had_been_flirting_with_her_coworker_she_said) Many folks asked me to follow up with an update so here it is, fresh from the oven.\n\nAfter reading every single comment of the reddit post, my brain just couldn't overcome the catastrophe and the collapse of the world I had built for me in which my wife is my love, my best friend and partner, as well a the person I admire the most. She was entirely perfect, and made me happy for many years. I thought no couple in the world could have what we had. We were both very happy for a long time. We were both attractive, we were both inherently good, had big hearts and were individually wildly successful in our careers.\n\nAfter the reddit post, I moved to an airbnb and eventually with family to think things through. It was a terrible time but a psychologist helped me recover from a terrible mental state. It coincided with the pandemic hitting very hard in my city (I caught the virus), which didn't help.\n\nDuring this time, we kept talking and my wife was very sorry and continued saying they hadn't met. I knew it wasn't true but was willing to forgive the woman of my dreams, who continued being in the highest altar of my universe.\n\nFast forward last saturday morning, I went back to our place, ready to forgive her and talk things through in the most mature way possible. And well, there she was, but I was the one who received the biggest surprise, to say the least. The guy was in my house naked, and so was my wife. The guy from the messages, the guy from the pics. The one she said she didn't even like. I caught him hiding in my bathroom as my wife was putting her pajamas on. When I saw him hiding in my bathroom, he uttered \"sorry dude\". For a second I asked myself, is this were I kill him? But I instantly replied \"I got nothing against you\", because the guy was just nailing this hot woman. Even if he was doing so in a house full of pictures of me. Pictures of our wedding and our families. Pictures of my dead father who would be so sad to see how the marriage he never witnessed was going to end. He has always been the reason I try to make the world a better place. He passed away two months before our wedding.\n\nI'm sorry. I still love her to death. But I understand enough is enough. Even if my world collapses, I hope I can build a new one without lies and in which I'm not just a blind believer under an altar of a fake god.\n\nGodspeed.",

I just accepted it was part of our dynamic then. \n\nThankfully, she left me for some other dude she repeatedly promised me was just her friend. I begged her to stay and she *didn't*.\n\nThat finally allowed me to look at myself and my own issues and take the time to heal. \n\nI'm doing really well nowadays.

The thing is, I expressed my concerns about him to her last year and she said there is nothing to worry about. \"I'm not going to do anything.  You have to trust me.  You never trust me.\"\n\nI've spoken to the guy's wife (they've been married for 30 years and have grown children of their own) and she says she had been going to counseling with him for two years over his feelings for her. My intuition was correct. I told her how I felt a year ago and she still betrayed that trust. Right now I'm ruined mentally but I've been going to counseling.  \n\nIt's been about 40 days since she told me and they've already gotten joint checking together and moved to a town an hour away to be together. We are still legally married.  She is to be served the divorce papers this week some time.  The kicker is that I've had both that guy and his wife over to our house to grill out and share the holidays, and likewise they've done the same for use over the past few years.  I've shaken this guys hand, shared a beer, fed him, and he still has the capacity to decide to wreck two families.  The same goes for my wife.\n\nI've been stay-at-home dad for the last 8 years.  I don't have an income and she drained the banks accounts and split.  It's insanity.",

You should be a good team. :)",

If she fucked the same guy a 100 times, that's a 100 times cheating. Honestly I'm not sure how you could count it otherwise. Like if your SO cheated for 10 years but with the same guy, is that really just cheating once?... (I'm not being rude to you tho, hope it doesn't come off that way!)",

You thought you knew that person 100% and shared the same dreams, hopes and future together. (Sunk Cost Fallacy)\n\nThat person presented themselves to you as being trustworthy, honest and a life partner. (Mirroring) \n\nThe Hopium makes you think that this person could not just throw everything away with their deceit. That your history is so much deeper and that the person shares your values &amp; goals. (Projection)\n\nThat there must be a shred of the person that they married inside the walking bag of skin. (Cognitive Dissonance)\n\nI agree. The only way out of this situation is for OP to unpack this with a trained therapist.  The shock of the in-your-face lying from someone that knows all of your vulnerabilities upsets the victim\u2019s reality.  Sometimes even causing C-PTSD.  It\u2019s complicated. And as everyone mentioned the first thing he needs to do is go 100% No Contact. If he has kids with this creep, then Low Contact + Gray Rock with the idiot.  He needs a legal expert NOW + therapy to process it.  \n\nNo. There are never 2 sides to cheating in a committed relationship.  I don\u2019t care if the victim was not the perfect spouse or partner. Cheating is abuse. The guy needs to go get STI tested. If he has kids, he has to ask himself if he wants to DNA test his kids too..",

I highly recommend it. Let yourself get through your feelings, but don't let the garbage keep you down. I can truly say my life is 100% better than it was. Now I laugh because the trash took itself out! After everything that happened, she did me a favor. Hard to see now, but better to not waste another second with a terrible person like that. And the guy who cheater with her, don't worry - he's a fool if he thinks it won't happen to him. Guess what happens when you involve yourself with a cheater, you get cheated on.  \n\nYou can do this. If one man can, so can another. I also suggest getting out and doing things you love. I got into obstacle course racing haha. There's something about conquering an obstacle course that just gets the adrenaline going. Restrictions are still varying, but get out and do things you love. Don't sulk. There are good people out there, but obviously you had one of inferior character. Next time around, look for the red flags. Mine had more than a communist party parade and I still got married, did everything for her and put her on a pedestal. Never put anyone on a pedestal. That was my other mistake. Chase excellence not women. She has to be complement to your life, not your focus. You'll be okay. Get out there and kick ass.",

You are not an idiot and you are not stupid for trying to make your marriage work and there is no shame in that. You are not to blame for loving your wife.\n\nKnow that you are not alone and there is support you can find in friends, family, your therapist and even here online on reddit - maybe go to the surviving infidelity sub for help. \n\nNo one deserves to have their life crumble down like this. But believe in your inner strength and put the work in to heal yourself and I know you will pull out of this stronger and wiser and more empathetic than before.",

At first it felt great, having someone love me so much (especially when I came from a past where I didn\u2019t receive much love). But as the first few years went by, even before we got married, I started seeing how unhealthy it was\u2014everything was ALL about me. He just \u201cwanted\u201d what I wanted. Where we went on trips, what we ate for dinner, and everything in between. It eventually became a problem. When you worship someone, you create an idealized version of them that is impossible for them to live up to. If you asked my husband, he would probably tell you that I am perfect. Spoiler, I am not perfect, I have personality defects like literally every other human, and it can be hard to be with someone who refuses to acknowledge that. We literally went to a marriage counselor and I had to say \u201cthis dude worships me, please make him stop.\u201d It\u2019s gotten better, but he just still loves the shit out of me and it\u2019s hard for him to not revert back into that worshipping habit. I have never cheated on him, nor would I, and after reading OP\u2019s whole story here I shudder to think what some asshole like OP\u2019s wife could have done to my sweet wonderful bear of a husband if he and I had never met. You can absolutely love someone without having them on a pedestal. I love my husband deeply, but I prefer egalitarian relationships as opposed to flat out worship of one party. OP needs to remember that worship is unhealthy and seek out equality in his next relationship.",

First, it kept him from being able to make independent decisions. At first it didn\u2019t  seems like an issue because I\u2019m quite independent and opinionated so I naturally made a lot of the decisions that impacted us as a couple, but it got to point where he wasn\u2019t making the decisions he needed to make as an individual. It felt like I was responsible for my life, our collective life, and his. I always felt like All of it was on the verge of collapse. Secondly, it also jilted the power structure of our relationship so much that I found myself acting in ways that I didn\u2019t like. It was like being given all of this power that went to my head and I ended up acting in ways that wasn\u2019t fair or could be manipulative. Then of course he would resent me for that. To make things worse I realized we were just playing out the same toxic relationship he had with his mom. Ugh.",

They should be able to advise you to how to deal with this so that you don't end up paying alimony, and all that crap. \n\nNow as far as your mental health is concerned. Don't be afraid to fall back on your family members, and trusted friends. You're already seeing a psychologist. So maybe go seek a specialist to specifically deal with this subject. \n\nNow it's easy to say for me. But don't blame yourself for this. Don't question what you should've done differently, or any of that. Unless someone's an abusive POS. There's no excuse for that kind of behavior. \n\nLike you said, it's better to start from scratch than to be in a world where your love, and kindness is met with blatant deception, and betrayal. Sometimes an end of something is also a beginning of something new. Focus on your health. Don't let this turn you into a bitter person. Don't use her as motivation when you move forward. Do something because you value yourself, and who you are.",

Still in the honeymoon phase, lovey dovey... Didn't live together or so, but spent a lot of time with each other. Did everything together. At a party she vanished. First, I was thinking she went to the loo or out for a smoke... I couldn't find her for well over an hour. Eventually she resurfaced and we went home. She had stains on her dress and her hair was messed up. Yeah, that type of stains. We were both very tipsy so I fell for her explanations and reasoning for what it was...\nFfwd a couple of weeks.. I didn't act on anything about this, but it was constantly grinding in my mind.\nAnother party, same group of people. She vanished again, but I also saw a dude randomly leaving. Following him like a super spy 007 - he's up to no good, I thought. Well turns out he was up into something good. My gf. Caught them both in the act. His schlong was inside her mouth and she was slobbering away on it. I just stood there silent until she was done, then I coughed. They were mortified and I was broken, but calm and collected. Looking back, it was a kind of comical sitch, him with pants around his ankles, boner slowly turning into a semi, her with messy hair and cum all over her face, both trying to make me believe that nothing happened.\n\nLuckily we didn't really have a life together, so I just dumped her then and there and went home to her place and got my meager belongings and we never talked again.\n\n\nI really hope that you are okay, OP. Things are going to brighten up, I promise. It will take time, but it will. Try not to get stuck in how good you were, and more on how she betrayed you. That will help you move on. Good luck!",

But then stories like this appear and I'm not sure if I can really fully trust anyone, even the person who I love with my whole heart.\n\nPlease, keep us updated how is your life going from now on",

And most importantly you know she never really cared.\n\nIt\u2019s a hard pill to swallow, but swallow it you must. Now it\u2019s time you take out the trash, and get some goddamn self respect.\n\nI wish you all the best.",

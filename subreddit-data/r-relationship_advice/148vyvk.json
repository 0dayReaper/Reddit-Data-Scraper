    "postText": "My boyfriend has been with me since last September. In December he broke up with me once (came back in mid January), and in early July, once again. After he came back, we made things official, went on a trip, met his family, he met my friends, I said I loved him, he said he would if he could. He struggles with feeling emotions (in my opinion, understanding his emotions). \n\nThen his work became stressful after very peaceful four months (no fights, always loving each other, meeting every week, spending 2+ days every week etc). He was dealing with some trouble there, and I could feel he started to pull away. Finally, after a week of not really talking to me, I expressed that I was feeling hurt. He met me to make up for his absence. I was at a friend's house and said he's being a dick by being absent (jokingly, we have a chill relationship). Later I said even though I understood his stress, him not replying to my texts hurt me, especially because he didn't communicate his stress with me. The next morning, he said he's thinking of breaking up because he feels he's perfectly fine being alone. Between all his relationships he has been by himself for 2-3 years and after his last relationship ended he promised to himself that he's not going to go for a relationship again. \n\nI talked with him and we decided taking a break is a better idea. Then he went full silent mode. He said he's trying to get out of deactivated mode two weeks ago when I pointed out that he shouldn't feel guilty for what he had done. He also said that he feels bad for not texting, said he will at least be in touch with me. We talked sporadically for three days, and then he went silent again. \n\nHe has also been depressed for the past couple of years probably (since COVID). Last time during the break he met a therapist (because he left his job as well), and the therapist suggested meds. He didn't get on medication since he had started to feel better.\n\nHe is in his late 30s, me in my early 30s. He has had 3+ year long relationships before. From what I've seen, he has a good and loving relationship with his family. So I wasn't considering a fearful avoidant type (FA) until very recently. I thought his personality type and depression+anxiety made him act so. \n\nI am secure in my attachment style. This relationship was very precious to me, but it's spreading me thin at this point. Do you think he has a fearful attachment type? Is it possible to develop this late in life? What can I do to make him talk to me? I miss him and I am hurt. If you are someone who struggled with FA type, how did you end up in long term relationships? \n\nPoints to consider:\nI know that he was a stubborn kid and his mom struggled with him but they have a very good relationship now. He is also close to his siblings and dad. \n\nHe is not in a good point in his life career wise. His mental health isn't at it's best right now. He has taken several impulsive decisions in the past (career, studies etc.). So the avoidant attitude is not only towards relationships.",

            "comment": "He is undoubtedly a fearful avoidant. I was in your position almost word-for-word and too tried to give my ex-partner the benefit of the doubt, that he was just stressed and overwhelmed. You bf likely has been a fearful avoidant for his entire life and while I don't know the details of his past relationships, there's a reason they ended, and he likely became more avoidant with each breakup. \n\nUntil he truly tackles his avoidant style with medication and/or regularly therapy, this relationship will require you put in more patience and understanding than you will get back. What ended up breaking apart my relationship was constantly hearing from him that the only solution is to breakup, even when the things I was asking for could have been easy to fix (regular communication, an occasional phone, etc). You should want to be with someone that wants to be with you, even when life becomes overwhelming. You want to be with a partner that can support you and can set aside their needs and their own preoccupation to be there for you. Good luck and you've got the right intuition &lt;3",

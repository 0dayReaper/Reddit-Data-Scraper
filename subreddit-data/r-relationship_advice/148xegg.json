If you\u2019re two 15 or 16 year olds experimenting and having safe sex it\u2019s a complete different story than a 15 and 18 year old sexting and having sex. \n\nIt\u2019s literally illegal to have naked pictures of minors. So don\u2019t do that. In a few months when you\u2019re 18 and she\u2019s still 15 it will get even worse for you. \n\nAlso just because others get pregnant at that age doesn\u2019t make it ok to do what you\u2019re doing.\n\nTaking a cell phone is not being overprotective. A cell phone let\u2019s you do a lot these days. If the kids can\u2019t use it responsibly then they lose access. That\u2019s just parenting man.",

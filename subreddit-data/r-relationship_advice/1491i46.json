    "postText": "\nI 21F and my boyfriend 24M have been together for 3 months. We met through a mutual friend group, and after 6 months of knowing each-other he asked me out. It\u2019s been going great! Our first date was lovely, and last week we even started discussing potentially moving in together eventually. \n\nI\u2019m autistic. I was diagnosed when I was 15 and that diagnosis was a massive relief for me, and honestly probably saved my life. I\u2019m extremely content with this aspect of myself, and when I refer to myself as autistic I don\u2019t see it as a \u2018label\u2019, but rather a simple descriptor that embodies a large part of me. While I don\u2019t talk about this often, I do have personal set views on the matter, and concrete opinions on how I describe it in relation to myself. \n\nHe\u2019s known I was autistic the majority of the time he\u2019s known me, and it never seemed to \u2018bother\u2019 him. He never singled me out for it or called me derogatory names for it, left me out because of it, made fun of any autistic traits I have when they manifest (if anything he\u2019s always doted on me when they do), etc. Due to this, and my general busy-ness with other things in life I never quite thought to sit him down and interrogate him on what he thought of me being autistic, or how he views autism. \n\nLast night we went out to dinner with 5 of our mutual friends from that original friend group. We were chatting for a long while before one of our friends brought up how one of her favorite celebrities had \u2018came out\u2019 as being autistic and how she never would\u2019ve guessed. My Boyfriend takes this as an opportunity to start talking about me. How \u201cthe autism spectrum is really so mysterious\u201d and how \u201csome people with autism really just don\u2019t \u2018show!\u2019\u201c and how \u201cI\u2019m one of the good ones- smart and well spoken\u201d. \n\nIt finally clicked in my brain just then that I really hadn\u2019t ever picked his brain on the matter. Whenever I\u2019d mention it or he\u2019d mention it usually was super shallow things like him asking \u201cwhen we\u2019re you diagnosed again?\u201d Or me going \u201cI think I\u2019ll ask the doc to lower my med doses\u201d; so hearing this, and not wanting to cause a scene, I just took a mental note and waited to bring it up later. \n\nWhen I brought it up he was confused. He says he was just complimenting me for not being a \u2018recluse\u2019 with \u2018lots of issues\u2019 like most autistic people are. He says my autistic quirks are what \u2018drew him to me\u2019 in the first place. I asked for him to elaborate. \u2018Your tics are so cute\u2019 he says, \u2018your little quiet fits over tiny things are adorable\u2019 he said, \u2018I like that you\u2019re blunt since most women aren\u2019t\u2019, \u2018I like how shy you are with people- it just makes me wanna protect you\u201d\n\n? \n\nI wasn\u2019t aware my sometimes painful tics were cute. Or that my autistic shut downs were adorable. That my frustrating inability to read social cues was so likable. That my social awkwardness was something that\u2019d make people think I needed protecting? Even if he didn\u2019t mean it; the entire description made me uncomfortable- as i I was being treated like a defenseless kid- so I quickly ended the conversation for the night.\n\nI feel like my entire perception of him has suddenly changed, and it\u2019s entirely my fault for not asking him about it sooner. I feel as if he may just see me as an awkward, autistic little girl who\u2019s only there there to boost his ego when he looks to me and thinks \u2018she\u2019s so pathetic, I need to defend her!\u2019.\n\nI\u2019m a grown lady. I have a job. I have a place. \nI have a social life, friends and hobbies. I don\u2019t need protecting, and now I\u2019m wondering how to approach this. \n\nMy boyfriend is a relatively defensive person, so I\u2019m not sure how I should bring up how uncomfortable I am with how he sees this part of me. Or if I even should at all? Is this beyond help? A huge misunderstanding? Is this super weird? I can\u2019t tell. Is it just me? Maybe just a break? \n\nI definitely feel I take some blame since I didn\u2019t ask him sooner, or explain these things to him- but I just don\u2019t know how to broach the topic without him getting upset that I\u2019m not taking his comments as compliments.  \n\nNow that I know how he views me I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll ever be able to change that view. Help!\n\nTLDR: I found out boyfriend views me in an uncomfortable way because I\u2019m autistic after a dinner with friends, and I think he may only like me for my autistic traits.",

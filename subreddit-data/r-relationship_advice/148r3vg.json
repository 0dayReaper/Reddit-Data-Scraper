    "postText": "Hello, everyone I need advice. Me and my gf have been dating for 2 years now and I have enjoyed every moment of it but she is basically never in the mood. I believe I have some what of a higher sex drive then normal guys(I crave sex at least 4x a day but understand that is a lot to ask for). I am in pretty good shape, workout often(4 to 5 times a week) and prioritize fitness, plus I love physical intimacy. While my girlfriend isn\u2019t very athletic, doesn\u2019t like to sweat, would much rather stay in bed all day or bake cookies and isn\u2019t the biggest physical touch person. I\u2019ve had to bring up the lack of intimacy from her side several times in the past and she says she will work on it and apologizes and has even went to the doctor to check her hormones and they said everything is perfectly healthy but i feel like it\u2019s not getting better. I ask her all the time if there is anything I could do better to put her in the mood or turn ons. I try to go on dates, give gifts and compliments when ever I can. She said I\u2019m doing great and don\u2019t need to change but she is still never really in the mood for sex. I am willing to try anything she feels like she is comfortable with and is down to try sexual (excluding bringing in another person) Her common excuses are that she is tired or she is feeling insecure about her body(I love everything about her body) and will then go on to complain about how she doesn\u2019t like how big her arms, legs or  stomach is for the next 2 hours and doesn\u2019t want to be touched. She has a history in Eating Disorders so I try not to bring up dieting because it may be triggering and she doesn\u2019t like to workout so I don\u2019t really know what to do to help. All her friends are toxic about body positivity and don\u2019t believe that a women should ever want to change her natural body and should just accept her body as is and she agrees with them to a certain extent but she is always insecure when we take photos together and won\u2019t post them or deletes the ones she doesn\u2019t think she looks good in regardless of my opinion.\n\nShe occasionally tries to initiate sex with me when she feels like I\u2019m being distant or something\u2019s wrong with me. Until a couple months ago I would just immediately masterbate to clear my mind and get it out of my system for a couple hours if she rejected my advances but she didn\u2019t like how often I would do it so I stopped which isn\u2019t a problem but I thought she would be more open to physical intimacy but I was wrong no increase whatsoever and she has very clearly stressed to me that watching porn is cheating and makes her feel insecure because she doesn\u2019t look like them(pornstars), because I\u2019m lusting over other women, she also doesn\u2019t really like to send nudes either so I can\u2019t replace porn with her. When ever I bring up improving our sex life she just shuts down and it feels like I\u2019m begging her for sex, which I hate. Most of the time now it feels like she will just say yes to sex to get me to shut up and isn\u2019t really interested.\n\nI love her and wanted to propose soon but feel like my sexual needs aren\u2019t being met, any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.",

Are you treating her like she\u2019s your dream girl that you want to marry and raise children with by taking her out on great dates and maintaining her beauty and femininity by providing for her? If not, or if you used to and stopped, maybe that\u2019s why she feels ugly. Women need the romance and physical gifts and help affording everything it takes to be gorgeous. We like to be relaxed and wood and charmed. Maybe the problem isn\u2019t hormonal. Maybe it\u2019s how you treat her (like a fleshlight). Are you contributing enough around the house, is it possible she\u2019s tired because too much household responsibilities like cooking and cleaning up after you, washing and putting away laundry all falls on her? Lighten her load. Give her a new look. Take her shopping and then to her favorite restaurant. Have a gift for her to unwrap at dinner with a card with a little money in it \u201cjust because\u201d, hire a house cleaner that week and make her a couple more meals than you usually do. I bet you\u2019ll soon see a different side to her if you follow that advice.",

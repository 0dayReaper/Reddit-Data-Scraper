    "postText": "Thanks for the great advice. So a lot has happened after mom and sister left and we took the money that was menat for my sister's car down payment for the restoration.\n\nMy grandma called me and asked what was happening. \n\nI explained to my grandma what happened and tried explaining who Stan Lee was. Surprisingly she understood just perfectly. I was relieved. For a moment I thought that my dad and I would get shit from everyone.\nMy sister started giving me shit about telling our grandma and being a \"snitch\". I told her that she asked me and I just told the truth.\n\nBut what took the cake was that my sister apparently ranted in her friend group chat about me and how she couldn't understand my behavior. She again ridiculed my hobby and so on. One of the dudes was really pissed and they had a big argument in the gc. The dude was so mad that he posted the screenshots in his insta story and they spread like wildfire. She is now being ostracized by our community with a few exceptions.\n\nMy mom and sister came back in the morning. They didn't talk much to us . My mom  came in my room and asked if we found somone that restored the picture. We had a short dry conversation till she asked me why I was making such a big deal about it. And I shut her up like you guys told me to. I started by explain who Stan Lee was, how long the painting took me, how much it meant to me, equated it to the monetary value and ended it with \"it is not only about the autograph. It's about the disrespect you both showed me and how little you seemed to care about me. You said that it was not worth it to destroy family over materialistic things but your daughter destroyed my most valuable possention because I didn't lend her my jacket \"\n\nYa'll my mom cried. She apologized profusely. She said she just didn't know how to deal with it and just wanted the tension to be over and as I was more cool headed than my sister she selfishly expected me to be the bigger person.\n\nMy mom and dad are now talking to my sister very seriously because she has yet to apologize for everything.",

If it required the slightest effort, I'd owe him big. So I ended up resenting ever asking him for anything and would avoid it at all cost.\n\nAnd if he suggested I do something or gave me advice, I'd often not do it out of spite--which I know is not a healthy response or the right thing to do and something I'm still working on, to a much lesser extent.

In 2015 (the last year of data from that website) was $50,219.  More telling is buying power due to inflation.  in 1985, that $24,289 salary adjusted for inflation was equal to $52,566 in 2015 dollars.\n\nMy parents bought a home in the suburbs of Southern California in 1985 and I distinctly remember the buying price being $186,000, a place which was unfortunately lost as an indirect financial victim of the LA riots of 1992.  In 2015, that house ranged from $625,000 to $677,000.  Today, that same house is listed on Zillow for $735,000.\n\nSo basically, to buy a house in this suburb of SoCal in 2015 compared with 30 years earlier required you to pay roughly 3.5 Times more a month (assuming an average $650k price) even though your buying power had not shifted by any significant amount.  It's one of the big saving graces of being much older than other people, having been able to buy a house when it was much cheaper.\n\nI don't know how extreme this anecdotal case is compared to other regions of the United States, but it still gives a sense of just how expensive housing has gotten compared to regular necessities.",

Before then people tended to live with their parents till they were married. My SO and I, both in our late twenties, live in a house that my parents built for my grandparents 20 or so years ago. It's on the same property as their house so it's similar to living at home, but with more autonomy. There are so many positives for us and them. They get some passive income, we get to see each other more often, it's cheaper for us than living anywhere else nearby, we can help them with things that they have trouble doing as they get older like lawn and garden care, and more. It's also helping us save up for getting married and getting our own place instead of renting.",

So they latch on to what they can see. We should try and do a better job of teaching kids that maturity is how you act, not what you do, and that adults can still like the same things they did when they were kids.",

She apologized profusely. **She said she just didn\u2019t know how to deal with it and just wanted the tension to be over and as I was more cool headed than my sister she selfishly expected me to be the bigger person.**\n\nThis is one of the main problems. I\u2019m happy she apologized but she has to take a good look at herself and her treatment of you and your sister. If this goes back all the way to your childhoods, your mom didn\u2019t do your sister any favors at all. It just made the small problem a worse problem when she could have nipped in the bud while you guys were younger. \n\nI also give props to your sister\u2019s friend. He gets it. It\u2019s unfortunate it had to take her ripping up a treasured possession to really show her that\u2019s not an okay way to get back at you for not lending her a jacket. Good grief...\n\nHow is the restoration going? It\u2019s not the same but it\u2019s great you have options now. I learned a lot too about paper, from your previous post. I\u2019m not sure if anyone shared this with you or if you\u2019ve heard of it, but look up [\u201ckintsugi\u201d](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi). It\u2019s not the same but this event changed you and your family, for the better I hope. It\u2019s gonna be harder for anyone to get away with pulling bullshit on you now.",

I just  deadpan  told her I wish I'd thought of that.... she finally had  some respect for me and my feelings/property at the time. The choker is bipolar and has always felt the younger one was loved more. Parents rarely take their children's feelings seriously until it gets out of hand.

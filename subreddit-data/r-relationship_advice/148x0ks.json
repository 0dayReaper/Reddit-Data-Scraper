    "postText": "I will provide context in the comments but I found an email dated back in March 28th from tinder it was a welcome to tinder thing . He blocked any future emails from them and I just found out because after being in a car crash with him yesterday I had a dream he was cheating so I had to check bc of how real it felt. My other car was stolen and I was dealing with insurance and other affairs at his apartment bc it was stolen in his city the same day he was being rude and acting inconsiderate and now I\u2019m finding out he downloaded tinder during those days. What should I do? How do I confront him? Should I just leave his house?",

            "comment": "We get to my friends house and I come out the bathroom only for him to ask me if it\u2019s okay if he does ketamine. And I visibly get angry, my friend says I told him he shouldn\u2019t of asked you. I tell him he\u2019ll end up doing whatever he wants it seems with or without my consent so just let me know I guess. He says that\u2019s im wrong and it\u2019s not true but does the Ketamine in the same sentence. He then gets super depressed while he\u2019s on it and goes on about how he feels jealous/envies the connection me and my friends have with each other. And that he feels so lonely; he\u2019s never had a connection like ours and just goes on about how he didn\u2019t have friends in highschool and all this. He starts crying a little and I feel bad even though I\u2019m still upset. So I go over to him to listen to him and comfort him and he tells me he\u2019s so sorry and he feels bad. And that I mean so much to him and I\u2019m the only person he has and that if everything goes to shit he calls me he has me. And it segmented into him cheating on me. And he says I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t know how I could do that to someone I love. I hope you\u2019ll forgive me one day. By the way the last\nKnown cheating incident between us where he sexted his ex and talked to her for months when I found out was January. He told me he didn\u2019t want anyone else and that it was stupid he didn\u2019t know why he did it, he bought me gifts and just showered me with loving texts and Etcx. And we got back together. I asked him if it was really only one time he actually met up with her and did things and the rest was just texting or if that was really it and he had nothing else to tell me about, he told me no that that was really everything. And that we probably shouldn\u2019t keep talking about this bc it upsets me. This was Sunday at 5 am. Fast forward to yesterday June 12th. He asked me to come back with him in my car for his friends graduation and also so that we could spend some alone time together since we didn\u2019t get much this weekend between clubbing and my friends and I agreed reluctantly because I was nervous since the last time I came with my car it was stolen. And the last couple times before that he was super rude to me and I found out about his cheating in January when I was in his city too. But I said yes, he promised me he\u2019d drive here since we\u2019d be leaving super early. So during the drive made him promise me also that he\u2019d keep some extra space and not drive so crazy because it made me stressed and nervous he agreed. When we got here we went straight to the arena the graduation for his friend was being held at and we looked for parking during this, my boyfriend makes a turn onto a street and this huge black Escalade looking car comes to a sudden stop in the middle of the street, my bf hits the breaks hard which causes me to scream. There was still some distance in between our cars but it frightened me especially since I told him to be careful driving throughout the last couple of days. All of a sudden the car in front of us starts reversing without looking behind themselves and we\u2019re both screaming out hey hey! Stop!!! And the car reverses into us and crashes up the whole front end of my car. The driver despite the accident being his fault was being very rude despite my being cordial with him and asking for information. I\u2019m frustrated and try to deal with all the stuff I have to do following an accident and again my boyfriend is just kind of nonchalant, which aggravated me. We get to his apt after the graduation and I\u2019m so stressed I just want to sleep so I tell him that and he tells me sex will make me feel better and I again say I\u2019m too stressed. When I go to sleep I have a dream of me checking his emails and finding out he\u2019s been cheating on me. When I wake up it feels so real to me and I feel so paranoid that even though I don\u2019t want to I feel like I have to, so he leaves to get us takeout and I tell him I\u2019ll be using his computer for YouTube or something. I check his emails and I find a \u201cwelcome to tinder , thanks for signing up!\u201d Email dated March 28th 2023.  I also see he blocked tinder from sending him emails after that and that they\u2019d go to spam. So I check all of his files. Deleted , spam, etc. Later when he goes to sleep I check his phone top to bottom every single app but it\u2019s all clean there\u2019s nothing there. I\u2019ve just been sitting on it in shock for the last 24 hours, because everything is so stacked on top of each other. I don\u2019t know whether I should just straight up leave his apartment without saying a word or confront him about it, or how I should do it or when. I\u2019m lost. Can someone please give me advice or an opinion on the situation?",

            "comment": "Fast forward to now, it was just my birthday weekend and I went out with my friends and my bf was supposed to be the designated driver, on the second night my friend took some molly and I said I\u2019d be skipping out because my body doesn\u2019t react well to drugs like molly. While we waited in line to get into the club I found out  that my friend asked him to take some with her bc she didn\u2019t want to do it alone. I obviously React negatively to this information because he just did it without telling me and put me and my friends at a huge risk. What if he was still high when we needed to go home? I had already been drinking and Whatnot but it majorly stressed me out because he accepted the responsibility of driving me and my friends whom I love all very much home. And he just basically bailed on that while we were already there. and didn\u2019t even bother to tell me, he told me he thought i knew or that I heard her ask him. But I said no obviously not, flash forward I cry in the club because of how disappointed I few and am not able to relax because I\u2019m stressed about how we\u2019re getting home and I feel like the whole night has been ruined. By the time the club closes he\u2019s sober but I\u2019m still upset obviously. He asks me to forgive him and I say I don\u2019t know if I can right now because I feel like I can\u2019t rely on him or trust him and he just keeps trying with me all night.  And at the very least he should\u2019ve told me. But he didn\u2019t.",

            "comment": "I need help I don\u2019t know what to do. For some context me (21f) and my bf (25m) have been together for 10 months now. We have had issues with him cheating before but he said he\u2019d never do it again. I could go more into past context but he\u2019s coming home in half an hour so I want to provide current context. A couple months ago in March I came to visit him in his city since we live two hours away from each other and during that visit I was worried about my car getting stolen bc it was on street parking. And so I kept asking him if we could go check on it and whatnot but he reassured me for days it would be fine.The weekend comes to an end and I\u2019m leaving for work and we walk to where it was parked and it was nowhere to be seen, he had told me he checked on it the night before and it was still there. I\u2019m majorly stressed and upset over this and he starts acting weird like I\u2019m overreacting or because he\u2019s over it that it shouldn\u2019t be that deep to me, I asked him to take the day off to help me but he said he couldn\u2019t and was just going to go to work. I end up bussing home the next day bc he says he\u2019ll be too tired to drive me home. The next time I come over it\u2019s because my car has been found and towed because someone in fact stole it and throughout my stay those days he acted very off and rude towards me.",

            "comment": "He didn\u2019t have any food in his house at all minus leftovers his mom made him which was a normal occurrence but that I had frequent talks with him about because it\u2019s rude to have someone over and not even have water or like a frozen meal or noodles or something to make themselves food with, especially since I always provided that for him when he came over to my home and accommodated to his vegan diet for him to have options. He said he\u2019d be going to work and left me at his house with nothing again so when he came home I let him know how upsetting it was for me and that it added onto my stress to not be able to have access to anything and I\u2019d repeatedly had talked to him about this kind of thing before and it was just a lot when I took a 4 hour bus ride to be here on top of just being here bc I had to deal with the matters of my stolen car and him making passive aggressive comments towards me and acting kind of like it was my fault or I was overacting wasn\u2019t helping and I wanted him to care or be supportive. He sighed at me and just said things like \u201cgod this is tiring\u201d I started crying and was like I don\u2019t understand why you would say that when I\u2019m trying to have an honest conversation with you. and It wasn\u2019t until  after I got up and grabbed my things to leave that he told me to stay and he was sorry. That was around March 27-29th.",

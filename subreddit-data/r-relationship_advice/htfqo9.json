    "postText": "Update post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hv4wc1/update_my_boyfriend_said_that_i_was_embarrassing/fyt0y1e/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nWe have been in a relationship for 1 year and we had a baby boy last week. I had a natural birth and my bf was there throughout the whole process. I screamed A LOT and each time I did he whispered something like \"can you stop screaming, you're really embarrassing me\". I also threw up a few times and I saw him cover his face in shame. When I held the midwife's hand for comfort he whispered \"let go of her, stop being so embarrassing\". He also said that my birthing position was embarrassing and called me a few vulgar names.\n\nI'm really upset about his behaviour that day, especially when it was when I needed his support the most. When  I try to talk to him about it he denies ever saying it and that I'm being silly...\n\nEdit: I know that there are a lot of comments but I am reading them all, and I just want to thank everybody for the advice and support so far. :) \nI spoke to my mum about this but she is the very traditional type and although she said his behaviour is wrong, I should try couple counselling first. I really don't think he is going to listen to me when I suggest getting help but I'll try. I am also going to talk to my public health nurse.\n\nEdit 2: Thank you so much to everybody who commented and dmed me with words of support and those who have also been in similar situations. I have since tried to discuss the option of couple counselling to him but to no avail, which didn't surprise me. My mum has agreed to let me stay there until I can find a new place for myself and baby. I haven't said anything to him yet, I've been advised not to so I am still planning out how I am going to take the next step.",

Then he helped hold me up as I delivered our son. Not to mention him holding everything together at home the whole time, and constantly being present and ready to help at any moment.\n\nThat is all said to assure you that your bfs behavior is NOT normal and is NOT acceptable. You're not being silly. This is a huge red flag, and a big indicator of what his future behavior will be like in stressful situations. Please don't feel like you have to stay with him just because you have a baby together. You deserve better than this.",

Her first child didn't get hurt as serious as your friends neice, but she is autistic now. OP needs to find somewhere safe to take the baby.\n\nEdit: The sequelae of TBI in children include deficits in intelligence, memory, attention, learning, and social judgment [7]. Family and twin studies investigating ASD show that risk is determined by genetic factors. However, environmental insults including TBI may also contribute to risk of developing ASD\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5198096/\nFor all those saying its not possible to develop autism from shaken baby syndrome.",

One way abusers do this is to convince their abused to have kids with them. His behavior is seriously concerning, abuse doesn\u2019t start overnight it\u2019s a slippery slope and the abusers tend to double down after certain milestones are reached. \n\nTrust your other relationships right now. Your boyfriend is not to be trusted and I do not think you should forgive him for his behavior. It will only get worse. Get yourself to safety, please. Call your mom and make a plan.",

I\u2019m saying this so that you think about the future ... is your boyfriend going to hate changing diapers because they\u2019re smelly, is he gonna hate that the baby wakes him up at night, is he gonna hate it that the children want to spend some time with daddy?  My first husband told me that the children and I were a ball and chain around his ankle. I am concerned that your boyfriend may also have this attitude.\n\nEdit: spellz",

Telling her to put a lid on it would have never occurred to me - from a father or birth partners perspective it can be really traumatic seeing someone you love go through so much pain and being unable to do anything other than remind her of her breathing exercises and telling her she can do it. \n\nThe fact that he had no empathy for you when you really needed it and didn\u2019t even bother going to the antenatal classes says so much about how little he thinks of you and is extremely worrying to me about how he\u2019ll treat your child. \n\nI\u2019ve inferred that you\u2019re in the U.K. There\u2019s a massive backlog registering births at the moment, I would recommend that when you do get to register the birth you DO NOT put him on the birth certificate. This will make it easier for you to cut him out of you and your child\u2019s life, which you definitely need to do. \n\nCongratulations on giving birth despite a total waste of space being near you. You and your child deserve better.",

I believe you (we all do) that your partner verbally abused you while you were giving birth and is now gaslighting you. \n\n2. It's my understanding that abuse often escalates after marriage and birth of a child. \n\n3. I saw that your mom was not supportive of your pregnancy. Hopefully she will be supportive of you if you decide to leave and can help facilitate your safety. This is the point where Ebbie45 would mention creating a safety plan. We've reached my level of knowledge so at this point, I'll point you to their post which contains the resources I mentioned above. \n\n[Resources](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ebbie45/comments/gses1k/comprehensive_abuse_resources_compilation_now/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\nWhatever you decide to do, I wish you nothing but health and happiness.",

You did nothing wrong, but if you tell the midwife to get him out, they will instantly have him leave. That would make it harder for him to gaslight you later as well.\n\nIf you are covering for him to your families, please stop. Talk to your parents and his about what happened. They will be horrified. Things will not get better in your relationship from here. This boy needs accountability. This is your decision, though. \n\nThe prospect of being a single mom is so scary and feels basically impossible, I know, but I think it will be better for you and your baby.\n\nAt 24 I took my 5 month old and left my horrible bf. I was a single mom for a little under 2 years until I met my current partner, who is my first born's dad because he has raised him for 5 years now and the bio father doesn't care at all. \n\nIt was so scary, but I am so freaking proud of myself for doing something I thought was impossible, and it was absolutely the 100% right thing for my son and I. You can do it, too.",

The fact that he whispered it to her gives him the power to deny and hold power over her (all hallmarks of Narcissistic Personality Disorder). Now he will call her crazy for \u201clying\u201d that he said these things in the first place.\n\nI\u2019m gonna pick up my other comment and paste it here since it\u2019s getting buried:\n\nThough this is written about Narcissistic mothers OP, you should read every single characteristic listed here and self identify how many of them he has displayed in your relationship thus far. Be HONEST with yourself!\n\nRest assured if you stay with him, he will only continue to show the current ones and likely begin to display MORE of them. Get away from this horrible man before he starts doing this to your child. File a restraining order and take necessary precautions to protect and defend yourself and your baby!\n\nparrishmiller.com/narcissists.html\n\nTo further add to this, narcissists to NOT take kindly to their victims wising up and leaving. He will either become aggressive and violent, or he will lay it on thick as fuck \u201cI love you; I didn\u2019t mean it; I\u2019ll stop\u201d etc. If he does the second one, the cycle repeats until he ends at the first. Just remember that no restraining order is going to actually keep someone away who wants to harm you. Only you can do that by putting as much distance between the two, locking your social media down, terminating mutual friendships, etc.\n\nLearning basic self defense and exercising safety (parking under street lamps, have your keys out already instead of digging in your purse when you reach the car, etc.) always. Don\u2019t go shopping at night. Be aware of your surroundings. You may even want to invest in pepper spray (if it\u2019s legal) or if not, buy a travel can of hairspray for the same purpose. Crazy people do crazy things when they\u2019re desperate, and we can\u2019t count on the piece of paper to protect us.",

Assuming you stay with him that long.\n\nTake a good long look at the man you had a child with. Can you see him helping you raise your child? And I'm not talking about financially or materially. Is the father going to be a good role model? Is he going to take an active part in the child's life? Or is he going to whine and say that diaper changing and feeding is \"women's work\"? Is he going to actually be a dad or just the parental bank?\n\nIf I were you, I'd start exploring my options, including the possibility of a future without him. You have your child to think about - not just yourself.\n\nI'm speaking as someone who grew up with a \"parental bank\". My dad wasn't outright sexist but he did show it in subliminal ways. He wasn't there for me as a father, he just paid for me and my sister to go to Girl Guides for one year and boasted it was good of him to do that. He never took me seriously when I told him I wanted to learn about cars, because I'm a girl. But he taught my eight year old male cousin how to drive. When I got older, he always said \"Just call Daddy when you have car problems\". The biggest thing that stays with me forever is he told me providing me food, shelter and clothing was what made him a good dad. It's not. \n\nGrowing up with only one good parent is way better than growing up with one great parent and a shitty one. Whatever your husband does or says around your child when they're older will be carried by your child for life.",

Whispering to you demonstrates that he knew there would be negative consequences if other people heard what he was saying to you, and he wanted to make sure you didn't have other people coming to your defense. The midwife likely would have kicked him out if she knew he was verbally abusing you during the birth as that creates a lot of stress which is not healthy, and that would have taken away his control over you.\n\nI'm glad to hear you're going to tell your mom.

This is a time you should be coming together and he should be so proud and grateful you carried his baby and are bringing it into the world.\n\nSo what you screamed during childbirth I did too, it bloody hurts! Also I threw up too, the whole gas and air thing didn't agree with me. It's a very emotional time and I would say very scary! My first was back to back and I refused all pain killers. Laying there for 22 hours I thought I was going to die... Then my second born was coming too fast and his heart beat on the monitor slowed dramatically I thought he was going to die. It's a bit of a traumatic experience for us women, it usually goes unappreciated.\n\nI'm glad you had the midwife there to support you, I used the midwife too on my second birth as my partner was with our first born and I didn't want them witnessing it so I was alone. It's scary!\n\nI'm alarmed he's gaslighting you right now. How has he been after birth? Do you have support from family? He doesn't sound like a very nice guy. There's nothing embarrassing about giving birth. Some women shit themselves \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f it's alot of stress on the body, what was he expecting you to say ouch this hurts and then the baby slowly and elegantly comes into the world while the midwives clap and cheer?

Pretty much all women scream, vomit, cry, and need support during labor, but most partners are helpful and PROUD of the monumental thing she is doing. If I was in a delivery with a partner who acted like your boyfriend, I would be pretty appalled, to be honest. I 100% guarantee you that the only one in that room that the midwife or nurses judged for their behavior was him (and who else is there to \"embarrass\" him in front of?). You are completely right to be upset, and the fact that he's trying to downplay his terrible behavior is a major red flag.\n\nThe few times I have been around couples like that as a medical provider, it makes me so sad for the mom and furious at the dad, but it's not my place to offer relationship advice at work (unless, obviously, there is imminent danger to mom or baby). Since I have the opportunity now, I'm going to take it -- you deserve better and your son deserves a better role model. You're both young, but youth doesn't excuse disrespecting your partner during an extremely vulnerable time. (And, for the record, I've seen 16 year old dads be fantastic labor coaches, so being 20 is not an excuse.) If he finds labor gross or embarrassing, how is he going to handle a toddler having a meltdown at the grocery store, or a poop diaper explosion, or his son screaming at 3am for no reason? Please know that you have value and his presence in your life is not mandatory -- you just created a whole entire human life and are going through probably one of the most stressful life transitions there is, and if he is adding to that stress and not willing to change, it may be time to reflect on whether he should be in your life at all.",

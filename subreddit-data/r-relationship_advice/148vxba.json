    "postText": "My roommate and I have been living together for almost a year now. I have always considered her a friend and really care about her. I've always tolerated her bad mood swings, and when she's down I try to help her as much as I can. \n\nDespite our ups and downs, I realized our friendship was more one sided. I was the forgiving friend who was always there for her. I've put up with so much from her. I'm always cleaning up after her, she wears my clothes without permission then returns them dirty, and last month we got into a fight after she lost my laptop. That was the only valuable thing I had and she lost it.\n\nSince then we were living in awkward silence until she disappeared on me when we ran out of groceries. I've tried to reach her but she hasn't been picking my calls. We owe the landlord 2 months  rent, she should atleast pay her part. I am barely surviving and don't know how to handle the pressure and harassment from the landlord. \n\nI have a sales job but sometimes pay gets delayed. Also, the pay is not constant since it is commission based. As much as I've explained to him, he does not care or understand my frustrations. I don't know how to get through to the landlord and he's threatening to kick me out. For the past few months I was the one paying bills without knowing that my roommate quit her job. I confronted her about not telling me this and she snapped at me. \n\nShe has very poor communication, never listens to me and I don't know how to continue this relationship, especially now that she disappeared when she's partly responsible for all this mess.",

She's left you holding the baby, so to speak.  BTW, she stole your laptop and sold it for money. She didnt lose it.\n\nThe landlord is within his rights to want his rent money and if he's not going to give you wany leeway then you need to resovle this for yourself immediately. Stop thinking about your roommate. Figure out how to live now.  Figure out how to pay off the landlord.  I suppose your name is on the lease?",

    "postText": "I was brought up in a household where I didn\u2019t get much love at all, and felt that being alone was comforting. But it changed when I started dating and I get attached and want constant attention from my partner. Recently my boyfriend has been a lot busier because he signed up to play for a team. (It would take up around 15 hours a week, he also works 40 hours on top of that) I felt very abandoned even though I know he still loves me very much. But I\u2019ve been very cold to him because of it. I don\u2019t know what to tell myself to change the way I feel, because I know a lot of it is just unreasonable. What conversations can I have with him? And what can I do to stop myself?",

I'm sorry that you didn't have much love in you childhood, but you need to work this because if it continues, it will mess up all your relationships. And remember this: is good to recognise a problem, and if you can resolve it all by yourself, great, more power to you. But if you can't do it by yourself, go to see a professional. And if said profesional don't work for you, try a new one.",

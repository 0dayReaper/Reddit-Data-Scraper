    "postText": "\nKeeping this vague. \n\nTo preface this, I\u2019ve been seeing this woman for a few months now, and I\u2019ve fallen for her. Hard. \n\nI had been seeing her very consistently at this point In the story. But we had not made things exclusive at this point. \n\nShe was at a get together which I was not present at wherein (shithead) was hitting on her, she denies him. \n\nLater he finds her and invites her to party which she is told mutual friends will be at. No party, (shithead) is alone and proceeds to remove her clothes etc. She is terrified and complies. \n \nShe doesn\u2019t tell anyone. \n\nAnother get together in which she is with her friends (I believe this is after we made things exclusive).  ( shithead) kinda walks her to her car and advances on her, she says no at first but complies due to threats. Same thing happens. \n\nMonth or so later she breaks and tells me all of this. I have no idea what to do. Im so fucking mad, I don\u2019t know if I even believe her due to the fact that she didn\u2019t say anything for so long and \u201callowed\u201d it to happen twice. \n\nShe blames herself and says she could have dealt with it better and fought harder. She has been pretty non forthcoming with details and claims it\u2019s due to fear/trauma. I want believe her but the whole story is pretty upsetting and confusing. She\u2019s been a lot more \u201cblas\u00e9\u201d about it than I\u2019d expect.\n\nFor the record I am a man who has not had to deal with anything like this, I know for a fact I may not fully understand her thought process. \n\nFuck I\u2019m so angry. I\u2019m mad at myself because I feel like I could have protected her. Dude will likely get off Scott free. I want to do so many terrible things to him, I wish I knew his address. I may try contacting his mother anonymously. I\u2019m mad at her because I wish she would have spoke out sooner and not have complied, especially the second time.\n\n I am completely at a loss. I understand I may catch some flak due to my having trouble believing her. I apologize for this.\n\nAny words, positive or not, would be extremely appreciated. I have no idea what to do.",

Have a conversation about your sex life, and if the things you do need to be altered or stopped for her comfort and enjoyment.\n\nTrauma causes people to act strangely at times. Be prepared to listen and if you're capable of it, understand a little. But mostly just listen, and reassure about it never being her fault.\n\nE: oh and if professional help is an option suggest it and support her doing it.",

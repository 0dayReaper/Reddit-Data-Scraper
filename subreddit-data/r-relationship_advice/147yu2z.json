    "postText": "So I've been with my husband since I was 18 and we met at a speeder awareness course. It's this thing in the UK where you get sent if it's your first speeding offence. We got along well during the class and he asked me out to get lunch afterwards. I look older than I actually am (unfortunately) and I used to wear heavy makeup back then, and the question of age never came up until our fourth date when he saw it on my Instagram. I had actually assumed he knew I was 18 because he held my driver's licence for me when we were waiting to leave the course. So no, I was not groomed, I just wanna put that out there.\n\nWe got married pretty quickly and I gave birth to our daughter when I was 20. I gained a lot of weight that I've only recently lost, and I was trying on all my old clothes to see what fit. My husband was with me when I was doing this. I found some of my clothes from my teens, and I make a comment about how my clothing (and makeup) style has become much more conservative. My husband then said 'yeah, that's because of me'. I asked him what he meant, and he explained that he didn't like how revealing my clothing used to be, so he would overly compliment me whenever I wore something more conservative such clothing I wore for work, when going to interviews or visiting older family members. He also said that whenever he bought me clothes as gifts, he would buy items that were more traditionally feminine, muted and modest. I asked him why, and he said, and I quote 'its like that Pavlov thing. If I make you feel good about being modest, you'll do it more and it won't be like I forced you'. That's what has me confused because technically he's right, I wasn't forced to change my style. He found it really funny, and he said that my fashion sense now was objectively better than it used to be, so I should be happy. He apologised, but he was laughing when he did so he wasn't serious.\n\nI really don't know what to make of this because it's made me not trust my own thoughts anymore. Like yeah I wasn't forced, but he admitted to using some psychological trick used on dogs to get me to do what he wanted. I'm happier with my fashion sense now because I do think it's better, but is that because he made me think that or is it actually better? I don't know anymore.\n\nOutside of this, he's the perfect partner and the best dad to our daughter. He was the only person that supported me taking a risk and dropping out of a  university course that made me miserable, and now I'm training to join a career that I know I'll love. I don't know if I'm reading too much into this situation or that this is something that needs to be dealt with. \n\nI would love some advice and/or some opinions on my situation because I'm honestly so confused right now.",

Instead of being mature and talking to you honestly about your fashion choices, your husband instead was a manipulative jerk. It\u2019s not funny, in fact it\u2019s a trust-destroying action. You MUST stand up for yourself and tell him that this kind of behaviour is just not tolerable. Together you are a team. You cannot be a team if he continues to behave in a way that intentionally undermines the trust needed for two people to work in harmony together as parents and partners. \n\nI think you can also make a strong argument in your own head that the fashion choices you now make would have happened anyway, with age and experience. These things normally do. The amount of sway your husband may have had over you is probably quite minimal. \n\nHowever, that does not lessen the fact that what he did was intentionally controlling and manipulative. It smacks of misogyny and is soul-destroying. It cannot happen again. As it is, it will take a very long time for you to be able to trust him again. \n\nHe needs to know this. And he needs to know that is non-negotiable.",

He did the same type of mental manipulation but was much more upfront about it, you could say. The last time I saw him was when I was seven and he was only aloud supervised visits and the lady that took me and my sister ( if I knew how she was or how to find her now I would sit down with her and never stop thanking her because she saved me and my sisters lives) was very on edge when she met him and I was very quiet the entire time because I was so afraid of him and just being near him because of the abuse and she could see this and because I wasn't talking much, he grabbed me put me on his lap and started whispering to me ( I don't remember what he said but I instantly started crying as soon as he started talking) and she was on her feet, and without saying anything to my sister she was already at the door ready to go (we didn't take our shoes and coats off around him when we would visit because we were uncomfortable) she grabbed me ripped me away from him and ran from the house to her car put us in and locked it and would not get in until he went back into the house. I don't remember what she said to him but she argued with him and threatened to call the cops if he did not get back in his house, but I do remember her saying to him \"you will Never see these girls again and I will personally make sure you never do\" and we never did. He went on the run and the only reason I know he is alive now is because he ended up in a hospital in another city close by and a nurse was able to track down me and my sister on Facebook and let us k ow he was there with extreme dementia and he thought we were dead and couldn't remember any other family names. \n\nWow. This has also just made me realize how much that nurse contacting me effected me and my mental health and I have a lot more answers as to why things have been going downhill mentally so seriously thank you for your comment it has helped me more than you will ever know and if I could afford to give you an award I fucking would! I know this was not the intended outcome of this comment but, seriously thank you.\n\nAlso, sorry for the long rant \ud83d\ude05",

If he had just said that he likes the change in your style because he  prefers seeing you in this style clothing over what you were before but would never force you to change, you probably would have felt more content about the change.   \nNow that you know his thought process, you could play around by doing something like dressing in ways you know he doesn't like when he's taking you some place you don't enjoy as much and then dressing up in styles he does like when he's been spoiling you and/or is taking you some place you're looking forward to going with him. Or, you could push both of you to communicate with each other better (honest apologies, expressing how you truly think/feel about things, listening to each other, etc.). It might help to explore some counseling, for you individually and/or for both of you.",

I can't think of anybody who I've ever dated whose style needed to be \"fixed\" because why would I be dating or in a relationship with somebody if I didn't like what they looked like?\n\nI raise an eyebrow whenever a man decides his GF should dress more conservatively. If he didn't want a GF (or wife) who wears revealing clothes and makeup, and needs somebody more \"feminine and muted\" than you, why not go hit on somebody who already wears the things he likes? You like your current look so it's fine, but I still think it's sort of looking down on somebody to decide you know how they should dress and that you need to \"fix\" them.",

While it\u2019s true that many of the aspects of your relationship are common in groomer/controlling/abusive relationships, which is why you\u2019re seeing a lot of very judgmental comments, the fact that you\u2019re not being held back from your support system (and seems like you have access/control over finances?) is a very good sign. \n\nI think my biggest concern is whether you feel in control of your life and that you have choices. If you truly do, then all good and hopefully a firm talking to or some couples therapy can help remove your husband\u2019s head from his rump. Gloating the way he did and his comments were disturbing and hurtful and he needs to see/correct that. I confess that his religiosity makes me wonder if he deeply buys into the \u201ctraditional gender roles\u201d and is not interested in keeping an equal power balance between you. Hopefully he will prove me wrong!",

Or was is just because he manipulated you into believing that your style was not good enough to be complimented although YOU liked it? \n\nI would examine your reasons for changing style and then begin exploring yourself more - regardless of his \u201creinforcement methods\u201d.

I would say his choices on dating and marrying you at 18 when he was much older is at the very least extremely taboo (in my opinion predatory). \n\nRegarding the situation he genuinely *tried* and believed that he did in fact manipulate you. What he did at that point (positive reinforcement is not manipulation it\u2019s literally communication) doesn\u2019t matter it was the intent behind it. The intention was for lack of a better word manipulative and predatory. I don\u2019t like the idea he\u2019s trying to establish a superiority complex over you and convince you that your life style changes are his doing. That is extremely unhealthy for you mentally hence why it\u2019s bothering you as much as it is\n\nAsk yourself, did he mean the compliments he\u2019s given you? Has the things he\u2019s done for you been his attempt at \u201ctraining\u201d you\n\nIt seems like a very slippery situation OP I\u2019m just a stranger on the internet so I\u2019ll dial it back and leave my closing thoughts \n\nTalk to him about the betrayal it made you feel and how he in fact didn\u2019t do anything to you, you just evolved and grew like any person does. Address your concerns with his behavior and confront it directly. Communication is essential. \n\nObviously you make the decisions you feel are best for you. But I think it\u2019s worth talking about the situation and reflect on your time together as a whole to address any further issues that could be lurking. Testing the waters with your clothing to prove a reaction won\u2019t really help you understand so just drive head on into this. \n\nI hope any of this helped, if not at least have a nice day/night\n\nStay safe",

I guess it\u2019s good that you like it, I\u2019m sure you look great either way, but do you like it bc YOU like it or do you like it bc it\u2019s what HE likes? Are you doing it for yourself or bc of the way he treats/compliments you? Which, again, he should compliment/treat you correctly no matter what you\u2019re wearing.",

He isn\u2019t the saint you paint him as, babe. I know a part of you knows that. I know how hard it is to reconcile the strong, confident woman you see yourself as with the girl who was controlled and groomed, *trust me, I know*.

Your husband, however, literally admitted he did this as a psychological way of manipulating you into changing for his benefit. The difference is the intention and it makes what he did wrong. It shows he has no problem using tricks to get his way no matter what and raises questions on what he'd try to change next with psychological manipulation.

While he has attempted to condition you, without getting into boring amounts of detail (and I would get fully lost in it), it's not really what Pavlov did at all. What he did is just what everyone does (express their preference) if they're honest, except he's convinced himself that he's some sort of wizard with it that's made you change who you are. That combined with him not seeming to care that it upset you isn't a good combo.\n\n&gt;it's made me not trust my own thoughts anymore\n\nLet me explain this another way. Have you ever seen a celebrity you like wearing a brand and think \"Oh, they look great. I should try that out at some point.\" and then bought a similar thing? How about an advert that uses your favourite song? These are the same thing he's done to you. The choice was always there for you to make yourself, but you received one of those options in a more favourable presentation that made you think better of trying it. And because we're very simple complex lifeforms, you and most other people in the world (including your husband) will respond to that. It's natural and something we come across every day (I can track what chocolate bars my wife will have a craving for) by what trash we pass on the street and how neat the wrapper is - closer to shop shelf ready, the more likely she'll fancy one in the hour) in many ways.\n\nNow the extension of operant conditioning is to add in a punishment system as well as rewards. Let's say he doesn't do the washing up one night and you just happen to snicker quietly when he takes his trousers off. And that happens every time that he doesn't do chores around the house, but you're all about what a big guy he is when he does those chores. Who do you think is gonna be Mr Sheen before the year is out? It's one thing to reward someone for making a favourable choice, but punishment for an unfavourable one is where I'm sure you've already guessed things cross the line. \n\nSo now we ask you the most important question in any of this; thinking back, did he also use a punishment routine (making you feel bad about yourself when you wore things he didn't approve of) to try and change you?",

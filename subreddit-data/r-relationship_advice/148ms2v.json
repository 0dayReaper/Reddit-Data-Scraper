Is there a way? \r\n\nNormally, I would just distance myself by not texting so much or being so receptive to texting, not seeking the person out in person, and so on. However, my coworker has recently started opening up to me a lot about some personal problems and I don\u2019t want to give him the impression that this is in any way wrong. I know it can be hard for men to open up like that, so I don\u2019t want to hurt his feelings by just suddenly changing my demeanour without explanation.\r\n\nIs there a way to get around this? Can I have my cake and eat it too?\r\n\nAll input will be much appreciated!",

This does mean that you'll have to sit with your feelings to an extent, but if you want you could totally be his friend and continue to support him, without getting involved romantically.\n\nHowever if you're sure that you want to distance yourself, then you should do it sooner than later. A lot of men already struggle with the belief that showing vulnerability drives people (women) away so you if you let this relationship develop any further and then suddenly pull away without an explanation, that would be hurtful for anyone.",

He's great company, he's just currently making my mind wander to places where it shouldn't. I feel like some temporary distance would be needed in order for me to get my head back on straight again, also for the sake of my own healing. \n\nBut maybe there is indeed no good way to have both of those things without simply telling him what's going on and hoping he'll be understanding.",

So perhaps it would still be better to not reveal that you have a crush on him. You could probably just say that you're still healing from your last relationship and would prefer not to get too close to someone else, especially at work.",

And that subtle desperation can cloud their judgement and cause them to want to cling.\n\nBecause of that, I would say the best option is probably to give him an explanation for why you're pulling away (healing from your last relationship, etc) so that he doesn't think he's being punished for being vulnerable, but not to say that you have feelings for him. I think not only could that be confusing, but it would open an avenue that you have no intentions of exploring right now and so there's no point. \n\nHopefully other people will be able to contribute better answers.",

And with that kind of age difference he's going to think it's enthusiasm and not interest. Even if he thinks there might be something there, he'll rationalize all sorts of reasons why a woman your age would never see anything in him.\n \nOn the other hand, I don't think you need to pull back per se if you enjoy the company, aren't crossing lines, and he's a respectful co-worker. What you can do is make it very clear that he's a friend. What I find works is saying \"You're a good friend.\" or \"You're a good work friend.\"",

I enjoy our friendship so much, but I\u2019m beginning to question whether that could be a possibility. If not, that\u2019s great and we can continue to be close friends. If you do see a potential relationship, I\u2019m not saying never, but I need time to heal from my last relationship. I want to continue with how things have been and I really enjoy talking about life with you. I just don\u2019t want either of us to blur the lines of our friendship and thought it would be best to just communicate this. I\u2019m sorry this is a little awkward, but I wanted to be honest. I truly value our friendship and my goal is to focus on that and healing from my previous relationship. \n\nI typed this out and read it several times and I\u2019m still not sure it\u2019s the best course of action. However, if I was a guy, I think I would like to hear this truth even if you don\u2019t fully reveal your crush. It will be awkward, but if he\u2019s as good of a dude as he sounds, he will totally understand and respect your feelings. I just think pulling back without explanation is probably the last thing I would do or want done to me. I\u2019m sure others would disagree, but that would be pretty hurtful. I\u2019d rather you just straight up tell me, you just want to be friends in case the thought crossed his mind. If you reveal either way that you\u2019re just looking for friendship, you can carry on how you were and be there for each other. \n\nAgain, this is a tough spot and I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a great answer that doesn\u2019t complicate things. So, take my advice or throw it away. I just wanted to give you a possible script about being honest without totally revealing your crush.",

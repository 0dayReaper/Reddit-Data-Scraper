    "postText": "Apologies in advance if I ramble a bit. My girlfriend (20f) and I (25m) had our first argument tonight over text. We've been seeing each other about 1.5yrs now (not much, I know). I was extremely hesitant to get into a relationship with her, as i feel I'm at the point I want to settle down.\nAnyways, she's been upset with me lately because I haven't said those 3 words that supposedly mean the world to her. Because of this, she lied to me about hanging out with some guy that I've never met and she only met a few weeks ago. Later that same day that she lied to me, she called me crying on FaceTime asking why I haven't told her I love her yet. The problem is, I don't know what love truly means to me anymore after some tumultuous relationships, and have been trying to figure that out. I don't think this is justification for her lying to me though, and feel as though I can't trust her again. Our entire argument happened over text (a huge mistake), but we may meet in person in the few days to discuss where we're at. Essentially I'm worried that even if we move past this argument, I won't be able to truly trust her again or if she'll understand why I haven't told her that I love her. I really care about this girl, and if she\u2019s in agreement about trying to work this out, I need to know if I should trust her again and move on?\nTLDR: first argument between gf (20f) &amp; i (21 V resulted in her lying to me and I don't know if I can trust her again or if",

If people that close to me can be so in love with someone and then it falls apart after a year or thirty years of marriage, how can I be confident I know what it really means to love? I know I care for her. I\u2019m just scared that those three words carry a lot of weight to them. And the past times that I have said it, I\u2019ve felt pressured into doing so and didn\u2019t mean it at firs, which is what I wanted to avoid with this gf.",

While it does not excuse her behavior, yours is equally bad.\n\nIf you are not willing to take that leap, the best thing you can do is end the relationship and sort out your own trauma because you are definitely dealing with some unresolved feelings.",

She\u2019s insecure in your relationship, and for good reason: you don\u2019t know how you feel about her. Seriously, you\u2019re 25 years old. If you don\u2019t know if you love her 1.5 years in, she\u2019s not the one for you.",

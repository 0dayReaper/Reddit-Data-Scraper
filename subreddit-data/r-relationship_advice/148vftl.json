    "postText": "I made a post about this a few days ago. My girlfriend of 9 months and I recently attended a friend of mine\u2019s party on Memorial Day. You can go to my profile to read my previous post for more context. Long story short, my girlfriend went behind my back and said things about me and is using the excuse of being drunk to say that she doesn\u2019t remember. I have three females friends that were with her when she spoke said things confirm that they heard it come out of her mouth. I\u2019ve confronted her about it three separate times and she\u2019s denied it and from what I can remember not even apologized all three times. Even though my girlfriend has lied to me and done me wrong, I still love her. Why is this?",

Love happens over many years as trust is built, bonds are developed, experiences shared and compatibility established.\n\nThat stage of the relationship is ending and you and she will gradually let your guards down and stop being on your best behavior for each other.

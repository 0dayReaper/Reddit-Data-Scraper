    "postText": "[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hx9boq/my29m_girlfriends27f_dad_discouraged_me_from/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nThanks for all y\u2019all\u2019s input it really helped and most of y\u2019all were right on the target.\n\nYesterday afternoon I sat my gf, Naomi down and had a conversation with her about what her dad said to me. I tried to leave out any mention of proposal and told her I was in their neighborhood and decided to pop by (Terrible lie, I know but she bought it). I told her what her dad said about us having dark babies and asked if she had any similar feelings about our kids popping out half black. She looked at me like I was out of my mind. She told me she didn\u2019t give a fuck about the color of her kids as long as I was the dad, which was reassuring. She was not so happy with her dad. She wanted us to take a drive over there and talk with her parents about it. \n\nThat evening we dropped by unannounced and when her mom opened the door to see us she immediately asked Naomi to show her the ring. Naomi was confused and I about shit myself. I, like a dumbass, didn\u2019t call ahead to her parents that I hadn\u2019t proposed. I guess her mom thought we were going to surprise her with the engagement and assumed I had already proposed. I was speechless. They began speaking in Korean, but from context I assume her mom was asking if I was too cheap to buy her an engagement ring. And Naomi looked at me and started hugging and kissing me. My secret was out and I told her I had already asked her parent for their blessing. She was a few seconds from crying but sucked it up so we could speak to her dad. \n\nLike I said in my og post my future father in law isn\u2019t great at English so he and Naomi spoke in Korean. According to Naomi, she asked him why he told me that, and he said that he was worried about their extended family not viewing our babies as Korean and being rude to them or me for being black. I guess this did not come across well in English, because he was just concerned for me and our kids. He didn\u2019t care that our babies would have dark skin. This was a huge relief. Her father isn\u2019t the racist their extended families are (but like, fuck them who cares what they think). I am just so glad that our future kids are going to have grandparents that are going to love them. Only downside is now Naomi is expecting my proposal so I really got to knock her socks off.\n\nThanks so much for all the help.\ud83e\udd1f\ud83c\udfff",

We just went to a pretty golf course to admire the flowers (many have concession places where golfers can buy snacks) and we got chocolate muffins. \n\nThen he proposed by some flowers.\n\nTHEN WE HAD THE WHOLE DAY TOGETHER. I had the whole day to admire my ring and just be with him. We went for a lovely dinner. Can't remember what all we did... lol. I think we went for a walk on the seawall. Pretty places.\n\nBut having the whole day to enjoy our engagement just together was fun.\n\nDon't take a long time planning. Just do it since the cat is essentially out of the bag.",

My now husband proposed in Philadelphia on our way walking to the museum (I\u2019m an art nerd). He pulled me into a little park area and proposed by a fountain. I then spent all day staring at the ring instead of any of the art, but I was happy to just be able to be with him. It was a weekend getaway, so I didn\u2019t even update my social media or my parents or anyone until we got home. It was nice.",

She used to take afternoon naps and I told her I was going to go over to my friends to hangout for a while while she napped. I secretly had been going to get the ring sized and diamond picked out and they let me know when it was available. So I left and she started to nap. I got back probably within the hour with the ring and came into our room where she was sleeping and tapped on her shoulder and proposed right there.  She had this sleepy shocked look on her face and asked me if she was dreaming. I told her it wasn\u2019t a dream and I wanted her to be my wife and I got a big yes and hug after she realized it was real life lol. You\u2019ll come up with something good, if you have the ring already and are looking for an opportunity to propose, there\u2019s going to be plenty of times you two are together where she won\u2019t have the slightest clue you\u2019re gonna propose and then bam, you got her! Like she\u2019s coming out the shower and you\u2019re there on one knee, you two are going to go out for something, tell her you\u2019re going out for groceries or food and then say you need help bringing stuff in and she comes outside and bam you\u2019re ready to propose. You\u2019ll start getting creative and you\u2019ll have fun thinking of how you\u2019re going to do it.",

In her culture you have a meal with each of our parents and ask the dad for permission. So she knew that it was coming. But I was planning on tricking her. Some weeks after I invited her to a beautiful restaurant. We talked, we ate and so on. She says she was just waiting for me to propose but nothing happened. We started to walk home and she was kind of disappointed. While we were walking home I mentioned I needed to sign a paper at our church(we met in our church for the first time). She was kind of tired and didnt want to go first but I was like, come on it will just take a sec.   \n\n\nWhat she didnt know was that I had been spending the day fixing the place. Removing chairs and stuff and used small candles and rose petals  to make like a way to the center of the church where there was a heart of candles and roses. At first she didnt want to go in and  wanted to wait outside but when I convinced her she was so surprised. I got her to the center and proposed to her there. Its one of the fondest memories together aside from our wedding. She loved it.",

We were planning on going to these great gardens for the day, and i was getting ready. I heard some rustling outside of the shower, but i just thought he was grabbing something from the bathroom. All of the sudden, the curtain flew open, and he was on one knee with the ring! It was actually great. Complete surprise. It turned out he was going to propose at the gardens, but he just could not wait. Love that man.",

It\u2019s a nice fishing village in the foot of a mountain. Very old, very beautiful. \n\nSo I learned how to say it in Japanese, and asked right after dinner. Her mother and grandmas were happy and clapped. Her father said, \u201cNo.\u201d it was a hard no too.\n\nMy wife was still in school at the time. It was a very nice college that he had paid a lot for. He was afraid she\u2019d quit and marry me. I assured him that I didn\u2019t want that.  She did finish. But I remember to this day how stunning his no was.\n\nWe\u2019ve been married 21 years now and she\u2019s never used her degree....",

His parents (who also don't speak English well) blatantly did not want him to marry a non-Korean woman and were quite adamant about it, so much to the point that my husband had to kneel before his parents (they're quite old-school) and pretty much beg for us to stay together after we'd dated on the dl for 2+ years. His own mom challenged him and our feelings told us if we really loved each other, then get married immediately. So we did, lol. We eloped at the court house: no rings, no special clothes, no vows, just our love.\n\n\n\n\n We've been married now for 3+ years, expecting our first kid in October, and I took night classes for 2+ years learning Korean to be able to talk with his parents. Communication isn't perfect, but I feel accepted enough, and I know they love us and see how we're so happy together. We love them, too. It can take time, but these worries of race, I find, are often borne from the fear of the unknown, an ignorant fear. Once the ignorance is removed, however, the truth will reveal itself, the fear subsiding. \n\n\n\n\nI highly suggest learning some Korean in order to ease some of the burden of translation off your to-be fiancee. Even basic phrases go a long way-- just be sure to use formal or honorific conjugation when speaking (this will make sense when you study) and DO NOT use informal with your in-laws, especially on your wedding day. Feel free to DM me if you need help for translation, textbook, app, or youtube suggestions!\n\nCongratulations, OP! \ucd95\ud558\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4~\u2661",

You learn a bit of pronunciation, phrases, culture and most importantly you hear people speaking the language a lot. This helped me a ton when I took a Korean class in college and I was a lot better than someone completely new.",

I found that watching shows that aren't scripted, like interview style shows, are exponentially better than the mellow drama shows. I *highly* suggest Hello, Counselor (known as \uc548\ub155\ud558\uc138\uc694 on SBS). It's a great way to hear from a huge variety of Koreans from all the different dialects and ages and issues, and it's a strong show that touches on some of the more taboo issues of Korean culture (ex: My in-laws are from Daegu, so the speak in the southern dialect, yet the Korean in most textbooks are Seoul dialect in northern dialect. Despite learning for 2+ years, there are still a few things I STILL don't understand because their words are just different from what I learned). Non Summit (known as \ube44\uc815\uc0c1\ud68c\ub2f4) features foreigners whose Korean is AMAZING and admirable who all discuss Korean culture compared to their motherland's culture. You can find both of these on YouTube.",

Look into youtube or ask another native speaker to at least have you say the words phonetically correct.\n\nI did that when I started learning Japanese, it was hard just saying things out as they were spelled then realized phonetically its different.\n\nYou can be a bit more sweet and  humorous in her language saying like. \" Honey,  this isnt the way I wanted to propose, but I would be honored if you would marry me. You are the best thing that has ever happen to my life\".  Its a mouthful but imagine if you said that in her home language, she would be sobbing tears of joy!\n\nAn intimate and sweet proposal is fine, the fact you already ask her parents for blessing speaks volumes that you are AWESOME!\nMaybe learn to make a dish she really wants,  then pop the question.\n\nYou can be a little creative and go to etsy and buy yourself a custom cake topper dolls to your and gfs image for a wedding cake. And preset that to her  with the ring in hand.\n\n\nI dont know if Korea has any traditional ways in doing a proposal.  Im half asian (Filipino) and if I went through my country's old school pre- colonial courtship-proposal method, thats a ceremony in itself but can be touching and meaningful esp if the family is traditional.\n\nPls update us soon with the proposal as this sub and this world needs more Happy Endings.",

I guess this did not come across well in English, because he was just concerned for me and our kids. He didn\u2019t care that our babies would have dark skin.\n\nFYI he's right to have that worry, Koreans are pretty racist. I live in Korea and I get asked regularly if life in America is scary due to all the black people.\n\nSo it's genuinely believable that he'd have that worry.",

Small misunderstandings will build up over time and you may come to resent her parents for things you thought were said but may not have been. \n\nAnyway, congrats on getting their full blessings and I wish you and Naomi all the best!",

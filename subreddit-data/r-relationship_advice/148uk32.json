    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nWill try to keep this succinct but there's relevant context at the start! Please skip to the dilemma if not interested\n\nI (32m) and my wife (32f) have been together around 10 years. I love her greatly and she's always been my greatest pillar of support, and she'll be an incredible mother one day. \n\nWe are very different: myself introverted but socially able enough to get by well, from a divided home and with very little attachment to any of my family; she very extroverted but fragile deep down, and from essentially the perfect family with a rare balance of having an abundance money, success, supportiveness and love. Whilst we are very different, we bring a lot to each other's lives and she's always made me significantly happier since I've known her. I'm extremely lucky in this regard. \n\nI am however more prone to living in my head, enjoying fantasies and noticing subtle nuances in people and the world, and i gain huge value out of understanding someone's personal character and struggles, whilst she has more of a CEO personality profile that looks big-picture. I've suffered with social anxiety and periods of depression before, and had close relationships for many years with people suffering from these plus BPD, so I've had a lot of exposure. Whilst I'm not 100% stable (I may have a very minor addiction to porn and sometimes struggle to sleep, but they don't majorly negatively affect my life), with my wife, her family and our friends I've been able to exist in a content, generally happy state for years.  \n\n(We are both athiest and somewhat against organised religions. I'd resolved that science governs everything, and that my purpose in life is to try to leave the earth slightly better than I found it, be as good of a father as possible to raise kids in love, and to observe the world and offer support/ learning/ etc where possible. I've accepted my own insignificance within the universe and am content with that as the world is beautiful, incredible, complex and I'm lucky to experience it. My life won't affect everyone but hopefully it might affect a few positively.)\n\nThe dilemma...\n\nRecently I was at a party where I got into a conversation with a girl. I found out during the party that she was born male but had transitioned a number of years ago, that she had undergone childhood trauma (not sexual) and that she was essentially the most intelligent person I'd ever spoken to. We spoke continuously for perhaps 3 hours during which she seemed intent on fully understanding and critiquing (charmingly, treading a very fine line) my every passion and world view. She explained every hole in my arguments to me, without judgement. She revealed that she had converted to Christianity after being Atheist, and made a number of strong challenges to my views on my subjective morality leaving me questioning why I feel governed to follow the rules I follow in life. She also admitted to flaws in her own views, and was very open to my attempts to change her mind, however felt that her arguments had a stronger basis. \n\nWe happened to meet a few days later (another party, long story) where she made no effort to approach me, however we bumped into one another and continued to speak for another 2+ hours on our backgrounds, views, etc, and where she joked that her 'plan' had worked at the previous meeting, which was to disassemble my entire being. \n\nEver since our first encounter I've felt like something is missing in my life, and I have a blanket of melancholy as if my body has released an imbalance of chemicals. \n\nI have 0 judgement of her gender transition, in fact find her extremely brave for it, and appreciated that after I'd opened up to her she was willing to open up to me about everything (including very emotional subjects), however I don't find her physically attractive and don't believe she does me (she has a female partner). Many of her friends later told me of her brilliance, so I also don't know whether this is how she operates with everyone. I've felt temporary/ fleeting attachments to other women whllst I've been with my wife, after say a good connection, however I've never acted and I've focussed on my wife whilst waiting for them to fizzle out. I've never felt like this however, with my entire world views off balance and without being necessarily physically attracted to her. \n\nI've resolved to read into Christianity to try and confirm my views. However, I've a longing feeling that without her support I'm not going to fully understand it all or any holes in my confirmations, and that we were meant to try to understand all of this together. Through this post I'm struggling to understand if this problem lies with some form of background depression within me (unhappiness with my interests or life), how that interacts with my world views, whether I am feeling a disconnect between me and my partner, or whether I'm feeling a disconnect that is entirely due to a game played by someone very intelligent. \n\nAny thoughts or ways to move forward would be appreciated! Thanks for reading, if you got this far \n\nTl;dr: married man had life views changed by extremely intelligent woman at party, now feels meaningless",

Perhaps because they met us at a critical point in time and provided a catalyst of influence. \n\nWe live in a romance-and-sex obsessed culture where if you have a strong connection with somebody, of course,  it is assumed it must necessarily be romantic or sexual in nature. But that isn\u2019t so. People relate to one another in a prism of shades and dynamics and interactions. \n\nI think it\u2019s beautiful that you made such an impactful connection that caused you to take a step back and deeply analyze your spiritual beliefs. \n\nI don\u2019t have any advice for you really. Just trying to give you a different perspective to look at this.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ll add, it sounds like what you\u2019re lamenting is less to do with her and more to do with you taking a hard look at elements in your life and feeling something (fulfillment, spirituality, authenticity, etc) is missing. It could be a call for you to take some shifts.",

Life is full of relationships of various forms, I'd just assumed (probably with societal influence) and worried that my connection with her could infringe on the connection I have with my wife. But you're right, I don't believe the interest was romantic or sexual in nature, just an interest in her considerations of the world as aspects of her beliefs aligned with mine yet had led to different conclusions. I actually feel a lot less stressed about this aspect, as if a weight has been lifted. \n\nYour edit is very pertinent, perhaps that's one for self-reflection and discussion with my wife. \n\nThank you",

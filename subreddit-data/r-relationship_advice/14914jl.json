    "postText": "I've had a very rough start to my marriage, and thought of divorce several times. However, she ended up getting treatment for mental problems and has become much easier for me to love. I did begin to fall in love with her again for about a month, however that feeling has faded and I'm not sure I'm happy. I'm actually not quite sure what I'm feeling and am hesitant to take any action and would like advice or help. I don't ever feel any joy spending time with her and don't ever feel like I want to go out of my way to try. I can't really name anything positive she's done for me that sticks out, and I just overall feel like we might just be better off as friends. Am i just not doing enough, or is there something behind what I'm feeling? I'm just very confused and would go into more detail about it if necessary.",

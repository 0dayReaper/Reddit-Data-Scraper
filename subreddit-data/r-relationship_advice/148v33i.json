    "postText": "I (25m) love this woman (25f) with all my heart. For the first 2 years we did long distance while we finished school. After we graduated we met in person for the first time, I would visit her every other weekend after that. We only lived 2 hours away. A bit after that she offered me to move in with her mother.\n\nWe did that for about 6 months, I went back in with my mother because there was unnecessary tension when using the kitchen/bathroom. She insisted on staying with me so we made it happen.\n\nRenting out my parents basement, our main focus has been getting our own place. 2 incomes a dog &amp; cat, we should be out in no time. However time passed &amp; we only been in our own spot once for 6 months. I was the only one working &amp; it was is a struggle, we got evicted. Fast forward to now we moved back in with my parents but I want to have my own.\n\nI'm not sure what I'm seeking but I definitely think my odds at \"life\" are better without her. I think I've come to a point where I'm questioning if this girl is helping or hurting me. I'm definitely in love with this girl &amp; don't want to lose her as even a friend because I enjoy her company.\n\nI work 50-60 hour weeks to barely keep us afloat, it sucks to see all my hard work to go away the same weekend I get paid.I don't have much options but I don't wanna hurt this girl than people have already hurt her. I just feel like I'm getting used and taken for granted.\n\nBasically what would you do in this position? Stick it out because love is rare nowadays or just separate take some time to figure out what to do next?",

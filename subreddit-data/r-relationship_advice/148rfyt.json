    "postText": "So my period is usually very consistent. I'm almost never more than a couple days late and even when I was, up until 6 weeks ago I never had sex, so I never had to worry.\n\n2 weeks ago I felt sick and had to throw up and I thought that was PMS.\n\nNow I'm 10 days late for my period and I'm starting to worry. We always use condoms so it's unlikely something happened but there's still a chance.\n\nThe only other explanation I have is my eating disorder. I struggled with bulimia in the past and when it first started it was the only time I ever missed a period and it was just one. Now I recently relapsed so it might be that, but I'm not sure. Back then I knew I couldn't be pregnant but now it's a possibility.\n\nI'm not sure if it's too soon to worry so much though. I think I'm gonna do a pregnancy test if there's nothing a week from now, but I'm not sure if I should inform my bf. I don't wanna worry him if there's nothing wrong, but if there is I guess he should be informed as soon as possible. What do I do?\n\nTldr: my period is 10 days late and I'm worried. My bf and I use condoms, but there's still a small risk. I wanna do a test if there's nothing in a week. Do I tell him?",

Purchase 2-3, in the event that one of them gives you a false result. \n\n\nYou should tell him at some point. If you want confirmation prior to talking to him, then you should take the tests first.",

Reflect on your personal desires and goals regarding starting a family. It's crucial to be honest with yourself about what you truly want.\r  \n\r  \nWill your partner try to make you have a baby you do not want? Open communication is vital in any relationship. Discuss your feelings and concerns with your partner, and pay attention to their response. Mutual respect and understanding are important in making decisions about parenthood.\r  \n\r  \nAre you financially secure? Raising a child involves financial responsibilities. Consider your financial stability and whether you feel prepared to provide for a child's needs, such as healthcare, education, and basic necessities.\r  \n\r  \nIs your partner someone who would make a good parent? Evaluate your partner's qualities, values, and behavior patterns to assess whether they possess the characteristics that you believe would make them a good parent. This includes factors such as emotional support, willingness to share parenting responsibilities, and commitment to the child's well-being.\r  \n\r  \nRemember, the decision to have a child is deeply personal, and only you can determine what is best for your own life. It may also be helpful to seek support from trusted friends, family members, or professionals, such as counselors or therapists, who can provide guidance and help you navigate these important discussions.",

    "postText": "Am i falling out of love, or something else?\n\nSo me and my girlfriend met in my sophomore year of high-school (junior for her) instantly we clicked and, we\u2019ve hung out 6-7/10 weekends since. Ive never really even had like a tiny crush on someone until her.\n\nBut recently ive been going to some close friends grad parties and stuff like that and this girl (F18) has been at all of them. Shes friends with my friends but we hadn\u2019t met until recently. Right when we were introduced we just clicked. We hung out and talked for a good amount of time. Ive noticed that I genuinely have contracted feelings for her. I know this because I\u2019ve been romantically attracted to her, shes pretty but its not the only reason. This makes me feel even more guilty because ive been very romantically attracted to her.\n\nI love my current girlfriend, and i feel guilty that I\u2019ve been thinking about someone else more then her. Ive learned a lot from my current girlfriend but I\u2019m not sure if I wanna stay with her forever.\n\nMy girlfriend has basically NO friends besides me and id feel so guilty for leaving her. Ive tried to get her to make new friends but she has trouble. I don\u2019t know what to do. Me and my girlfriend are VERY close. We\u2019ve broken up once in the past but it was minor.\n\nI don\u2019t even know if i want to leave her because it\u2019s possible i leave her and don\u2019t talk to this new girl and then feel bad. I haven\u2019t seen my current girlfriend much recently because I\u2019ve been pretty busy, but i am so lost and don\u2019t know how to feel about anything. Im young and still learning, i don\u2019t want to fuck anything up, but i love more then one person?\n\nTLDR: I love my girlfriend of 3 years, but recently ive been having feelings for someone else and don\u2019t know what to do.",

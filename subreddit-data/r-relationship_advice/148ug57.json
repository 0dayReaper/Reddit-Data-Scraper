    "postText": "\nOriginally posted in aita! \n\nTLDR: my father was awful and after ten years of hurt he wants to meet up to \"apologize\"\n\nSo my(ftm22) father wasn't the greatest. When he wasn't threatening us, he was telling us we were worthless, or just flat out ignoring us. So me and my two siblings, who we'll call Jane(f25) and Jake(m27), pretty much went nc with him after he screamed at our mother because she didn't have all the details on a truck repair. Well, when I was 18, my parents divorced. Father found divorce papers in my mom's purse after he went through it, and told my mom HE wanted a divorce. Surprisingly it was a pretty amicable divorce? So Jake and I went NC with him for about two years, while my mom and Jane went lc with him. Well after he screamed at my mom, we went pretty much no contact. (Jake owes him a legal debt, so he went lc until it is paid off). Well put of the blue, he texted me, Jake and Jane saying he wanted to meet up and offered pizza. Wouldn't say what it was about, just that he wanted to meet up. I told him we had plans but they weren't set in stone. He called my mom and asked her what I meant, and she told him what I did. We had plans but they weren't for sure yet. So he said \"okay, just let me know\" and left it at that. Well, those plans happened so we didn't meet up with him and we heard he went to the movies. Went to see the new guardians I believe. Well, fast forward about a week and he still hasn't told us whatever he wanted to. So my mom comments \"yknow, whatever he wanted, it couldn't have been too important.\" I shrugged and we left it at that. I texted him that night, asking what he wanted, and tonight he finally got back to me after like, three days. (He's been in Indiana I think) Well, apparently he wanted to explain his reasoning behind what he put us through, and explain his side. Said he \"finally understands why he did everything he did.\" I honestly don't care, nor do I want to hear it. I've been on the road to recovery ever since my attempt back in 2020, and I don't want him messing up my progress. I get scared every time I see him, and I have panic attacks every time a man gets angry around me. Even if they ain't mad at me, it scares me half to death. He still wants to meet up but idk.",

    "postText": "So my boyfriend and I broke up last week and he booked a flight to see me on the 28th of June way before the breakup. He\u2019s still going to come and chill with his friends and meet me for the first time ever. Our breakup was mostly because I was complaining that he wasn\u2019t putting in any efforts to talk to me and spent most of his time playing games and watching anime. Even though he\u2019s pretty adamant about us not getting back together even if we meet, I think a lot of things will change when we do. Should I stop having this false hope?",

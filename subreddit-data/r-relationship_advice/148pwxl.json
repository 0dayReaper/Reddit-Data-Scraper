    "postText": "This has been my best friend since we were 5 . We have stayed best friends even when friendship groups around us have come and go.\n\nOver the past few years I've been mainly in another city studying for my degree whilst my best friend has been in my hometown. During that time they have gotten close with a couple other people and been brought into another friendship group. It is mainly my best friend and 2 others that have been hanging out. I also know these others from school but we're not really close, they are more on the acquaintance/friend side and I only really see then when I'm with my best friend.\n\nI have hung out with these other guys plenty of times and have also known them for a long time. I don't really have any friends outside my best friend, and mainly hang out with him and extended family my age.\n\nNow earlier this year me and my best friend were speaking about going on holiday together, which we know would be alot more fun with others with us in a bigger group, so my friend suggested we'd go with the other guys he's become close friends with, which I said I'd be down for.\n\nNow 5/6 months have passed and my friend has told me he's going on holiday with the other two guys and a couple of people in their friendship group. He said he was invited by the others and hasn't involved himself in much of the detail and has just said he'd go.\n\nNow I don't know how to feel about this. I feel a bit annoyed since we had spoken about going on holiday this summer and the first thing he did was mention bringing the other guys along, but now he has been invited to go with them but I guess didn't mention/ask if I would like to come?\n\nPerhaps others in the friendship group didn't feel comfortable with me going, I'm not sure. Should I ask my friend why I wasn't invited? I feel my friendship with him is slipping away as he gets closer with the other friendship group. I've also noticed he doesnt really call me to hang out much anymore when he's with the other group (previously he used to call both me and the other guys from the group to hang out or get food etc) now I only see him 1 on 1 and he'll meet and go out with the others separately",

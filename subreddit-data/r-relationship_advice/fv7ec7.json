    "postText": "Hello Reddit. Please bear with me regarding my formatting and things. I have read the rules and things, but I'm an old fart who is rather on the wrong side of 40 so I'm not overly well versed in the art of efficient internetting. \n\nMy boy is 20 years old. He's absolutely my pride and joy, and there is nothing he could do that would ever make me love him less. For the first half of his life, I regrettably wasn't involved very much. His mother and I parted ways when he was just a few months old and at the time I was struggling with a heroin addiction and was absolutely not as present in his life as I should have been, nor was I suited to fatherhood at all. I saw him, at most, two to three times a year for the first 12 years of his life. I won't discuss details because that's his private story to tell, but when he was 12 he revealed to me that he was being badly mistreated at the hands of his mother and her boyfriend. Despite not being the best father at the time, I didn't want my boy suffering any more so I got myself cleaned up and sorted out in order to get full custody of him. I've effectively been a single (and sober!) father ever since and he has little to no contact with his mother. He's everything a man could want his son to be; he's uniquely kind and fiercely loyal, he's unflinchingly brave, he's incredibly generous and, despite the horrors he suffered as a child, he's unfailingly positive and sunny to the last. Somehow I of all people was bestowed with the honour of watching him grow from a sweet young boy to the greatest man I have ever known. I cannot stress enough my pride in him.\n\nWhen he was 18, he got accepted into a top ranking university on the other side of the country. I was sad to see him go, but simultaneously overjoyed that he got into his first choice and was starting a new chapter in his life. He comes home once every other month, and on the month's he doesn't come home, I go to visit him. He's doing well in uni, has made lots of friends and seems incredibly happy there, which I'm obviously chuffed about. Since his second year, he's lived with his \"friend\" in a flat off-campus. I've strongly suspected since his early teens that my son is gay, and I now more or less have confirmation that this is true and that his \"friend\" is actually his boyfriend. \n\nSo, for this COVID-19 faff, my son decided he'd rather come home and quarantine at mine than stay at his uni flat. His \"friend\", however, would be left alone if my son came back as he's a Candian and his family are back over there, and I gather he doesn't have the best relationship with them anyway. He asked if it would be okay if \"friend\" tagged along to my house and I said of course, no problem. \n\nThey've been back at mine for about six weeks now. They think they're being subtle I know, but I've caught them doing coupley things on several occasions now. The \"friend\" has slipped up a couple of times and called my son 'babe' and 'sweetie' in front of me, which I pretended not to notice for the sake of saving embarrassment. There have been nights where we'll be watching a film with the lights off and, thinking I can't see, my son will have his arm around the \"friend\". One day I walked into the lounge and I'm positive they'd just been kissing and were trying to cover it, though I admit I have no confirmation on that one. The most solid evidence, however, came a few mornings ago. I get up very early to go for runs in the morning (hence why I'm making a reddit post at five in the morning haha). As far as I was told, my son was sleeping in his childhood room and his \"friend\" was in the guest room. I don't know what possessed me to do so, but on Tuesday morning I cracked my son's door open to check on him like I used to when he was a kid. Lo and behold, they're both asleep, snuggled up together, in my son's bed. That's more or less solidified for me that they're together. I didn't say anything, just shut the door and went for my run, and I haven't mentioned it to them yet. \n\nWhat I want advice on is this; how do I let my son and his boyfriend know that I'm okay with them being a couple and they don't have to feel like they have to sneak around in my house? I want them to be comfortable here and I want them to know I support them both no matter what. Or is that not a good idea? Am I better off leaving it alone and waiting until they tell me themselves, if they ever do? I obviously don't want to force either of them out of the closet, but at the same time I hate feeling as if they feel like they're being forced *into* the closet in my house. What's my best course of action here?? \n\nTL:DR - my son and his \"friend\" are staying with me for quarantine. It's abundantly clear they're a couple, and I want to let them know it's okay and they don't have to sneak around in my house. What's the best way to go about it?",

I hope he knows and sees that too. \n\nI\u2019m a lesbian and I can totally relate to what your son is doing and feeling. I like the above advice in just referring to your son\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d as his boyfriend. It\u2019s casual and your tone will be the telltale sign in all of it. \n\nYou could also write a letter addressed to him if you wish. I think that would be really sweet and I would keep it forever if I were him. \n\nThanks for being one of the good ones.",

When I was in my late teens/early twenties going to art school with short different colored hair every week and questionable early 2000s style, my dad called me and said one of his super religious work friends disowned his daughter for being a lesbian. Then he went on to say that if I am gay, that he loves me no matter what and would never do that. I\u2019m not, but that still meant a lot to me and if I was a lesbian I definitely would have been terrified to tell him. \n\nMy immediate reaction to op post was just slipping in somewhere that they are a cute couple. I love the note idea too!",

I bet that made you feel super happy. \n\nMy parents are pretty supportive. My mom went through a lot of denial when I first came out and I think my dad just never knew how to react even though he has a gay brother. Both of them say they love me no matter what and they just want me to be happy and I definitely believe them. After I came out years ago, I introduced them to my first girlfriend and they both liked her. When we broke up, it went quiet for a while and it still doesn\u2019t really come up unless I\u2019m actively dating someone. But hey, they\u2019re not hateful at all and they respect me for who I am and that\u2019s all I want. :)",

Just reassure your son its ok and that you'll love him no matter his sexuality. My friends dad left his son a sticky note for him to find that just said he loves him and approves of his boyfriend because hes such a gentleman lol.\n\nI think reassurance is best, but i love everyone else's comments.",

Just watch the passive aggressiveness if someone breaks a rule in public. Case in point, I remember once being in a room at a spa that was supposed to be for silent meditation and two middle aged women were chatting away. Myself and around 8 other people were obviously annoyed- sighing and huffing and giving them dirty looks. This went on for a good 10 minutes, one person even threw their arms up in exasperation. You could see everyone in the room was quietly seething but dared not say anything. My husband (not British) just turns to them and says \u2018LADIES, can you zip it please?\u2019 They turn to him in shock... \u2018what?\u2019. And he says again \u2018zip it, there\u2019s nobody else talking in here\u2019. I was a bit shocked by his directness but my God it was hilarious. Everyone in the room was silently smirking and laughing to themselves. When we came out, someone actually came up to us, congratulated my husband and gave him a high 5. It still makes me chuckle thinking about it.",

But as someone who is just beginning to be an adult and growing up in the closet with a dad that I feared would never accept me let me just say this. He will tell you on his own. Maybe drop some subtle clues, overtly telling him that you would never think any less of him, that it would never matter who he loved you would always love him. \n\nI cannot stress this enough, having him know that you'll love him no matter what is so important and will literally help him make some very important choices in life. I often wonder how different things would have been for me if I didn't have to worry about my homophobic dad ever finding out I was in love with other boys. It took me too long to fully figure out who I was. But it already sounds like he knows you love him and he knows how to love in return. You already won. The rest isn't isn't important. Just keep letting him know you love him no matter what. \n\nJust keep being great my man. I grew up knowing my father would never accept me, and it led to drug addiction and a series of poor choices. I'm now over all of that and finally love myself for who I am\n It took a while but it happened. All you have to do is that. The rest is trivial. \u2764\ufe0f",

Its a stressful time for many who are not out or accepted. \n\nYou can bring it up to your son in that context. \"Hey son, I saw an article the other day about a parent finding out their kid was gay during this quarantine stuff and the kid was struggling to look for a place to go after the parent freaked out. I can't believe a parent would ever treat their kid like that. I would love you no matter who you loved as long as they made you happy and treated you right. Unbelievable the way some people treat their kids\" \n\nThis lets you have an in person conversation, but the topic isn't your son. It lets Your son know how you feel without any direct pressure for him to reply or feel forced into saying anything. It gives him control in the sense that he can sit on that info for as long as he wants. \n\nIf you don't want to have an in person conversation, the poster who suggested sending a short text had a really great idea that lets your son go at his own pace.",

Try to give him clear opportunities to open up about his love life, or drop little hints that you think his \u2018friend\u2019 is a keeper or that you think they have a sweet connection.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t pressure him to come out to you if he isn\u2019t ready, but you could always ask him about it while letting him know he doesn\u2019t *have* to tell you what\u2019s going on, but that you\u2019re there to support him no matter what. He might be relieved to have that security of knowing how you\u2019ll react before he has to gather the courage to bring it up.\n\nSidenote: this post really made me wanna come out to my mom, so thank you for that as well",

It particularly hit home when a family friend who is my age brought home another girl. Her mother called my mother and was a bit sceptical and really unsure how to handle it, and my mother just replied _\u201dbut aren\u2019t you happy she has found someone she loves and wanted to bring home?\u201d_. My mum didn\u2019t see anything problematic in the situation, she was just so happy for our family friend. And knowing that really reassured me that my parents would accept me no matter if I brought home a girl or a guy.\n\nMaybe that could be something you could also do?

            "comment": "Gay guy here, with accepting family members.  So I have personal experience on this one. I'm also seeing some advice that I wouldn't necessarily recommend, so here's my experience.\n\nMy mother just casually mentioned one day when the subject was relevant that she'd be okay with it if I turned out to be gay.  Later, when I found out that I was, in fact, gay, and fell in love with my long-time best friend, I had no trouble coming out soon after that.  I took a couple of weeks to figure things out but that's it.\n\nAfter that, we discussed who else in the family would be accepting and who we might want to hold off on telling.  My immediate family is accepting, but the further into my extended family you go the less accepting they get, so my grandparents still haven't been told 3 years later (honestly they probably know, but won't say anything and none of them are severe bible thumpers to the point where they'd actively seek it).  So that's a point you'll have to consider going forward.  My boyfriend's family is in another state and are more likely to be a problem if they found out, so we established a cover story that he is sleeping on the couch/in the spare room.  Helping them keep the secret from anyone else they don't want to know is important, too.  I don't imagine you'll have many visitors for a while, but if the stay becomes longer term (hell, it's the situation I'm in), work on a cover story if your son/son's BF deem it necessary.  My stance on this isn't fully shared by everyone -- some people would rather just be open about being gay and let any unaccepting people sort themselves out.  So let him decide this, and be ready to support him with his choice.\n\nThat all worked well for my family, and it may work well for yours.  It might just be that my family likes to communicate with subtlety (like I'm absolutely sure she was telling me that she suspected that I was gay then, but apparently my parents saw a gay couple kissing on their honeymoon and talked about what if they had a gay son), and an open approach would work better since you already know, but... dropping the hint in a non-forced way is the best thing you can do for an LGBT person in your family, because unfortunately secrecy is the only reliable shield we have, we never know if someone will be accepting or hurl abuse at us if we come out unless we have some hint.  It turns everyone into a potential threat, and honestly I hate that I have to keep it secret from others in my family.  Just make it clear that it's safe for him to come out, and I'd recommend letting him save face by coming out on his own terms which I can assure you will not take long, and ask who else (if anyone) he wants to know about it, and you will have his eternal gratitude.\n\nTL;DR: My family just mentioned that they'd be okay with me being gay, and that helped me come out safely years later.  The more direct approach might work if that's what your family is used to doing, but either one would get quick results.  It's possible he may want to hide this from other family members -- let him decide what he wants to do in that regard, and offer your help and support with that.  Also get in the habit of knocking before entering if you haven't already.",

Not because of anything my SO has said or done, but just because of my history. \n\nSo your son might be logically aware that you wouldn't have a problem with him being gay, but emotionally it's still a big deal coming out to you.",

This is a very personal, vulnerable part of him that he may not be ready to share, more so because of the number his mom did on him. He may be thinking that even though you\u2019ve been a great dad, if this happens to be the ONE THING you\u2019re not okay with then he\u2019ll have no one, and is either again abused by his only remaining parent, or out on the street with his partner during a pandemic. \n\nI\u2019m making a lot of assumptions based on vague text I know, I\u2019m just talking as a previously abused child who\u2019s learned self-preservation to an unreasonable level. I would lead the convo with you making sure he know you\u2019re accepting of the LGBT+ community, no matter what. He should at least have that reassurance and come out to you when he\u2019s ready.",

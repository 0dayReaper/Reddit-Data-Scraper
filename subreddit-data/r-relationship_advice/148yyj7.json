    "postText": "I was recently in a car accident and my car was totaled. The accident wasn\u2019t my fault at all. I had a note on my car which I purchased before I filed for a chapter 13 bankruptcy. Because of the bankruptcy I now can\u2019t get a new car loan to finance a replacement car. I\u2019ve been denied for all the loans I\u2019ve applied for. \n\nMy BF offered to co-sign for me and I said absolutely not. And I scolded him a bit telling him he shouldn\u2019t offer to co-sign for someone he\u2019s only known for a couple months (we started dating in March). And co-signing isn\u2019t an option anyway because I already tried with my mom as the co-signer and I was told I can\u2019t be on the loan at all for it to be approved.\n\nThen he offered to gift me his car because he said he wants to buy a new car anyway. His car was given to him by his mom. I again said absolutely not. \n\nThen he offered to sell me his car. It\u2019s a 2017 Nissan Sentra and I\u2019d pay him KBB for it. So like $8k-$9k.\n\nIs this a bad idea? My sister says it would be fine because it\u2019s a sale so if we break up I won\u2019t be tied to him, but that it\u2019s maybe taking advantage of his weirdness and that he is trying to be a hero. My best friend said she thinks it\u2019s sweet for him to offer but also weird.\n\nEditing to add, he also offered to buy me a car which I also said no to. So I would feel a little weird taking the deal because then he\u2019d have to go buy himself a new car. I feel like he wouldn\u2019t be buying a new car otherwise.",

It ties you two together basically. Not ideal.\n\nAdditionally, you run the risk of him hanging this \"favor\" over your head for him doing a good deed by selling his car to you. You could utilize his \":advice\" for shopping around for a new car instead. \n\nKeep things simple by shopping around for a different car. Really no insult for not accepting his offer.",

    "postText": "I apologize for any typos in advance, but I\u2019ll take any help, im desperate :( \nI know, I know, situationships are not relationships with commitment but I promise there\u2019s more! \nSo i\u2019ve known this guy for almost two years now, since the beginning he\u2019s struggled with being monogamous and only talking to me, even when we had set boundaries and expectations. Shortly into actually dating, I found out he\u2019d slept with one of our coworkers, obviously I broke it off. \nHere\u2019s where the complicated part comes in, every time I catch him having done stuff with other people and I call him out, he spam calls me, shows up to my house, says he\u2019s going to end his life, drunk drives, etc. basically just destruction to get me to talk to him \nOne of the last times I cut him off and made him leave my home, he texted me saying he crashed and if I would go get him. My sister made me stay home and said \u201che\u2019s lying\u201d, low and behold, a couple days later at work (we work at the same place), his car is completely fine. he had told me his roommate picked him up and the car had damage to the bumper but there wasn\u2019t a single scratch.\nEvery time, he begs for me back with the same typical cheater script and I go back out of guilt because I don\u2019t want him to hurt or injure himself, he makes me feel so bad for wanting a better relationship \nRecently, my mom and I decided to move states away and when I mentioned this, he started obsessively looking for jobs in said state. This really irked and upset me, I don\u2019t want my cheating situationship to follow me to a new state where it was supposed to be my fresh start. My father also recently passed away and the move will be closer to my extended family so my mom will have more support, this has also added on more stress and a want to change things since my entire world feels upside down. \nI recently found more texts and messages of him going out to a different city with other girls and I\u2019m at a loss at how to bring it up. I don\u2019t want the same thing to happen all over again I want to clean my hands of him, working with him also makes it hard\nIs there any advice you guys would have for me? Has anyone been through similar? I have no idea who to ask for help, im desperate to move on and find someone that will be loyal to me and won\u2019t make me feel guilty about it. TYIA :)\n\n\nTL;DR: situarionship keeps saying he\u2019ll be loyal to me, continues to mess around with other people, cries &amp; threatens to unalive himself when i catch him. help needed to get out of this situation ! :(",

That kind of guy can ruin your future. He will keep you from meeting someone and having a healthy relationship. It\u2019s manipulative AF to threaten to hurt himself, etc if you don\u2019t do what he wants. You are not responsible for him, for his actions. \ud83d\udea9 \ud83d\udea9 \ud83d\udea9 for dayssss, girl. This won\u2019t get better, trust me, I\u2019ve been there. You have to completely block him for at least two months once you\u2019ve moved. No social media, no texting. You have a whole new fresh start to work on, don\u2019t drag your old mess into a clean house!",

He has been successful so far using that method, so he believes he can do whatever he wants, and if he gets caught, oh well, he can get you back by... You can't hold yourself responsible for him. Break up with him and take yourself a vacation out of town so he doesn't have access to you, block his number so he can't spam you and you don't even have to hear him run through his usual threats.

They're all alive today and have moved on/have their own lives with some other unlucky lady. \nHe probably gives these threats to other people and has done it in the past, too, with success at getting people to do or behave the way he wants. Block him and sleep with someone else (rebound) so you're not tempted to unblock him.",

    "postText": "My SO (27m) and myself (23f), we have been in a relationship for 2 years now which moved on fairly quickly, we connected deep in raving and the gym, overall I love the crap out of him and I know he loves me too. I am diagnosed with BPD, Depression, anxiety, adhd, etc etc, which means that sometimes I might say or act irrational at times (I am actively attending 2 types of therapies per week) I am waiting for him at home for him to get off the gym and meanwhile I am preparing his lunch for the next day and the dinner for tonight which I clearly told him about so I asked him to get frozen veggies for the meal, 30min go by after the class is done and cool, 45min and I ask for something else which I get \"okay\", cool... 1 hour goes by and I text \"did you get lost?\" (in context we joke with eachother lots and I include humour on 99% of the things I say) he gets home carrying the 3 things I asked for and that's when I am questioning like \"Hey what happened? Did you get a call from your mom? what took so long?\" for which I get \"I filled up my gas and tires, get off my back\" stunned and a little hurt and disrespected, due to the fact that I now had the resposibility for all the cooking since it had been long started (I dont like cooking much, so we spoke that we will share responsabilities when we are both home), I wanted to have a nice evening with him; I paused stunned and continued what I was doing whilst also listening to a podcast on my headphones, 2 hours go by and he asks if 'I'M still mad at him?' (? I'm off your back man, what the hell!?) at this point I acknowledge that I shouldnt had kept my distance and/or gave him silent treatment but this is not the first time! He asks to go out for a joint with him which I said okay after I finish what I was doing, 30 sec later he says that he's going to bed instead (okay go off), now I'm seating here reminiscing on every single weekend/evening that I try to take off to spend time with him but inturn it ends up like this for no reason! I am so frustrated at well... basically my life (BPD coming through!!! EMOTIONS EMOTIONS EMOTIONS!!!) and so I immediately feel that detachment from him and so I feel hurt and I know this isn't going anywhere, what can I do to not have this dumb 2-5 hour long silent treatments!? Usually we end up talking about it and my feeling HURT, like HURT HURT (when I cook I strive to see him enjoy so thats another stab, I took the evening off, stab, I prepared things, stab) I ussually end up crying because I feel like he deserves someone who isn't like me and well I can't take being hurt like this all the time for NO REAL SERIOUS reason, so than he starts crying and than my feelings vanish and it's hard for me to process them without me just wanting to care for him because than he starts crying. Ugh, what to do about these situations? What are your thoughts?",

    "postText": "Me and fianc\u00e9 have become engaged at the end of last year and we are getting married in November of this year. A little background we don\u2019t go through each others phones we are both open to just giving our phones to each other no questions asked. I was eating lunch and my fianc\u00e9 had stepped out to grab something and his phone kept buzzing I looked down to see who was messaging him so much and noticed it was a bunch of IG alerts. I went to check if he had posted something funny because at that time I wasn\u2019t on social media but I knew he always posted stuff that was hilarious and always got a lot of likes. Clicking on the alert it took me to his DMs were I noticed that he had like 16 unread messages from his followers including my messages that I had sent him before deleting the application, excluding 2 messages that were read and responded to, one I recognized as his friend that he was close to and of another who I didn\u2019t recognize and who was a girl. I thought that was weird because my fianc\u00e9 is a guys guy he likes to hang out with his guy friends and rarely was friends with girls. So I decided to check out her profile and see if it was someone who was apart of his friend circle. Only to find she constantly posted half naked pics which was surprising but the second thing I noticed is he and her had no mutual friends but she lived in our area. So I went back to the messages and saw that he was always very quick to reply to her and reacted to all her posts. There was one particular message that made my heart drop, he replied to a post she made about her ex being unfaithful which my fianc\u00e9 replied - if that was my girl she wouldn\u2019t be my girl anymore. The girl  wrote back - Right you would tell people what\u2019s up and that was your girl. My fianc\u00e9  then stated the following to her - Nah that\u2019s not my girl she\u2019s just with me. Which she reacted to with a laughing face. When she didn\u2019t say anything he said - jk I tell people what\u2019s up. I didn\u2019t feel good about that interaction and tried to talk to him about it which he turned around and said I am always jumping to conclusions and I am upset over nothing because it was a joke. I pushed and asked how would he feel if I said that to someone which he cut me off saying that it wouldn\u2019t matter because it was a joke I tried to explain to him why it upset me and he said - I don\u2019t feel like I did anything wrong. I dropped it because his birthday was the next day and I didn\u2019t want to ruin it. It\u2019s been a few days and I felt maybe we could have a calmer conversation. I told him I was still hurt by the way he spoke to her and how he reacted after. He said that he stood by what he said and he doesn\u2019t feel like he did anything wrong. I told him it would make me feel better if he unfollowed her which seemed to trigger him because he then started yelling asking why and what the point was I stayed calm and replied it would make me feel better and he then yelled why. This was my mistake because I was so flabbergasted by the question I replied with because I know you\u2019re choosing me and my feelings. He freaked out and started yelling that he can\u2019t believe that I said that and why does it have to be a choice. I walked away after he was done. I feel so defeated and tired. I don\u2019t know what to do, any advise?",

In your post in one message the other girl mentions being cheated on, how do you think she would react to finding out now she is the Affair Partner for a cheater. Now she is causing someone else the same pain she went through. Soon-To-Be-Ex could end up catching it from both sides. \n\nI have commented in other threads I believe cheaters should be exposed to everyone.\n If OP decides she cannot accept what he has done and breaks the engagement then OP should let everyone know what he did. Don't give him a chance to tell some story to blame it on OP. He has worked hard at this, made a number of decisions and plans on how to do it and hide it from OP, so everyone OP knows should be told how hard he worked to get the title of cheater. \n\nAs a side note, you might want to talk to a family law specialist about this part. Since he is the one breaking the engagement OP may legally be entitled to keeping the ring and selling it. \n\nI'm sorry you're going thru this, I just can't understand people that do stuff like this.",

Personally I would make it my hill to die on for these reasons:  \nbecause first, he is being very inappropriate with someone else (ignore the joke BS excuse), then, instead of acknowldging his mistake, he gets even more and more defensive which is even more concerning and then, instead of unfollowing out of respect and love for you, he gets more upset and angry with you!! \n\n\nYou wanted to feel that he chooses you which you are absolutely RIGHT about, but he obviously does not prioritize you and your feelings. He did not choose you and if you get married,  it will only get worse from now on. \n\nI advise to stop being scared or guilty to call him out on this. That was no innocent joke. That was the beginning of cheating/ cheating. If you accept to be a doormat this time, you will always remain a doormat and he will get more and more confident in his ways.\n\nCall him out, make demands to be respected, make ultimatums, ask him to choose you, if he reacts the same way (gaslighting, defensive, guilt tripping) well then you have your answer. If he doesnt choose you over \u00e0 \"joke\" then you have an idea about how much of a priority you are to him. You are not.",

I am around the same age as you and wanted to confer some advice. \n\nI recently started feeling very good about myself, started posting more bikini pictures compared to my more wholesome pictures. I just love myself and I want to curate my life here by the ocean. I have gotten some folks be a bit unwelcoming to the change but mostly positive. I have gotten men with partners more commonly hit me up and this is what I have gathered. \n\nYour boyfriend should have immediately removed me if you requested it. I have never had a partner not remove someone that made me uncomfortable. I don\u2019t ask them to remove the person, I state that I don\u2019t like the way that their interaction made me feel. They either speak with them and correct the behavior or remove. \n\nI had a friend that got into trouble for liking pictures of mine on Instagram. Through our friend group I heard that she felt insecure and disrespected by him talking to me. I had no idea. Instead of removing me he just unliked all my pictures and continue to lurk on my stories. I only noticed because of the grapevine. At first I thought she was ridiculous but then I realized that just because I don\u2019t feel uncomfortable with my partners doing that, it doesn\u2019t invalidate her feelings. She may have sniffed something out about him and it had less to do with me. I removed him. I felt sorry for her and I would always be a source of contention for them. As soon as they broke up, he immediately hit me up. She was absolutely right. I would never but he definitely would.  She knew something was up and he refused to change. \n\nThe messages were inappropriate. He refused to remove her because he doesn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings, because he doesn\u2019t care about yours. Your feelings matter. You have already communicated what your boundaries are but he will not honor them. I would give him and you some space to reflect because he is actively hurting you. Don\u2019t let him gaslight you and let the truth come to light. His reaction was off.",

Definitely need to work on communication and more clear cut boundaries, but forcing him to unfollow her isn\u2019t going to end well either because he doesn\u2019t see this the way you do, it can cause resentment if he does unfollow/cut contact.

When my now husband and I first started dating, we were both talking to other people and if I saw a message like that from a very long time ago (before our relationship was serious) I wouldn\u2019t hold it against him.",

You need to be more confident about your partner, especially if it's been 9 years together. \n\nIf you don't trust him, small things like this will eat you up going forward.\n\nEdit: these comments seem to want you to pack your bags and leave. Don't make a judgment from here. People here will preach life is perfect, your life will be a bed of roses etc etc. a good partner doesn't come often. Unless this is somewhat a regular occurance from your bf, you most probably regret it breaking up later. But If you feel he cheated, that's your feeling and you are entitled to it, and can leave anytime, you don't need affirmation from the internet for that.",

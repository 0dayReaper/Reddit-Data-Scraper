    "postText": "Just like the title says. Me  and my partner have been together for a little over half a year after a friendship of 15 years. We have always gotten along well and have always shared content that we found exciting or hot. After we got together, I found out he had a whole map of thirsttraps (called 'nudes') on his phone. I felt very uncomfortable about it, and it made me feel very insecure especially since our intimacy was very on and off. I talked to him about that, and he agreed to delete it.\r  \n\r  \nYesternight however I was unpacking my newly bought comic of Sunstone. For those of you that don't know, Sunstone is an adult webcomic featuring two women dealing with sex, relationships, and fetishism. I highly enjoy the art. He suddenly started debating with me in how it's different that I read this kind of stuff from him having thirsttraps on his phone, going as far as calling it sexist. I already made it clear to him that I don't care if he m\\*sterbates to porn or whatever, I just feel uncomfortable with him having it on his phone because it feels personal almost... I can't really explain why. I'm unsure how to continue this conversation when I can't really make sense of why I feel like this. And I honestly also am starting to feel like maybe I'm being overly sensitive. So I'm looking for advice mostly, and opinions if you guys maybe experienced the same.\r  \n\r  \ntl;dr: bf saves thirsttraps to phone, I asked him not to. He feels it's unfair for him to not be able to do that while I enjoy comics with sexual themes. Why do I feel uncomfortable with his behavior?",

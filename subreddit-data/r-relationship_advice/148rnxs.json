    "postText": "TLDR: I (32M) caught my (31F) girlfriend sending \"I love you\" texts to a guy she told me was a friend.\n\nMy gf and I have been dating for 6 months now and our relationship has grown significantly since. When we met, she had just gotten out of a long term relationship (8years) and so had I. Her ex (Tom) Had gotten rather dependent on her for financial help towards the end of their relationship but was not showing signs of being romantically invested and that ultimately was what motivated her decision to break up.\n\nWhen we started dating, she made it apparent that she has a few friends from years back that she has grown rather close to and majority of them are guys. A group of about 4 guy friends and they are all mutual friends. As I would assume it would be for most guys, I was a little uncomfortable with that fact but chose to give her and her friends the benefit of the doubt in believing what they have, truly is a genuine friendship.\n\nCase 1: About a month ago, I learnt that she has been sending Tom money periodically upon request from him. He would make up stories like he needs fuel money, his mother is sick, he lost his work computer, his car got broken into and robbed, his phone got stolen etc. How valid those tales are, I will never know, but if that is always your only motivation to speak to your ex, then according to me, it is safe to assume that you only see her as a walking atm you used to date. One afternoon, I brought her lunch to work, sadly found her in not the best of moods, when I asked what is bothering her, she told me that Tom had just called earlier in the day with another sob story and he had asked her for some money. She then admitted to having sent him money just a few weeks prior because he had said his phone had been stolen so she sent him money to buy one which he had not to date. I try my hardest to stay out of her interactions with Tom as she has made it clear that though they have broken up, she still deeply cares for him and can not let him struggle if she can do anything to help. However, on that day, I chose to tell her that I truly think that he is using her for money and does not seem to care about her wellbeing. This is clear in their interactions as he only reaches out to her wheh he needs money. Which is pretty much all the time. I ended it by telling her that ultimately the choice is hers but I hate to see her being used. We then agreed that she would stop sending him money regardless of whatever story he comes up with. Still on this phone matter, when he initially reached out to tell her he needed help with a phone, she then resorted to asking me about phone prices under the guise of wanting to purchase a secondary phone for herself. As her partner, I made recommendations though her reasoning for getting that phone didn't make the most sense. Weeks later when she was telling me about him asking for more money, I then reminded her that a few weeks prior, she had told me that she had wanted to get herself a phone while in actual fact, it was Tom she wanted to get a phone for. I pointed out how betrayed that made me feel for the fact that she chose to lie to me in that moment and essentially prioritised Tom over me in that moment because now I have to deal with the harsh reality that she lied to me.\n\nFast forward to a few weeks later, Tom sends yet another message to her asking for money. Upon asking what she is going to do, she responded by saying that she is confliceted. That absolutely threw me off and in that moment I lost my cool. I asked how much in total she has \"lent\" him and she estimated $5000. The actions that follow are not my proudest moments but I harshly instructed her to let him know in that moment that she will not be sending him any money going forward and he should come up with a payment plan as to how she will repay her all her money. He then replied to say he understands and he will do so. That was the last of it untill 2 days ago; we get up to get ready for work and just as we are about to leave the house, say around 0730Hrs, I see a missed call notification from Tom and casually let her know that Tom just called. Just so that she is aware that I know. I can't imagine any other reason he would call her aside wanting to ask for money, but I didnt want to get into it that early in the morning. We left for work and throughout the day I hoped that she would tell me what Tom had called about as this has now become a sensitive topic. Nothing was said until we got back home in the evening. Still nothing was said throughout the night; we cooked, she backed \"brownies\" showered and still at no point was the elephant in the room addressed. In disappointment, we went to bed because I truly just did not want to probe and genuinely hoped that she would see the need in letting me into their interaction without me always having to ask.\n\nCase 2: The same evening, after cooking and baking, she lets me know that she will be taking some of the brownies to one of her friends from the group of male friends; Mike. I met Mike about a month ago when my gf and I had gone shopping and just so happened to run into him. She introduced us, had a brief chat and went on about our day. Mike was in a car accident some time ago and as a result, his lower limbs have been compromised since so he lives with cronic pains. The brownies that my gf delivers to him every so often are meant to help alleviate that pain (THC). So when she says to me that she will be dropping some off with him, I was understanding for that reason. Further than that, I don't have any knowledge on the intricacies of their relationship. So the time is about 2230Hrs when we go to bed. Alarms set, off we go. 0400Hrs this morning the first alarms start rigning on both our phones, I turn mine off, then I turn hers off. I then see a message notification on her phone that reads **\"...anything that can help. I love you too.** ***\\*3 heart emojis\\******\"** That was all I got to read. This suggests that before she passed out, she had sent Mike a message to let him know that she baked him brownies and that she loves him. I got up from bed distraught, went to the bathroom and took a long shower trying to cool myself down. Soon as I got out, I went back to bed to warm my body up a bit and found her on her phone watching youtube videos. So this means she saw the message at this point. I lay next to her and kept to my phone. 5mins in she asks me if i'm ok, I proceed to let her know that no I am not ok because I just saw a disturbing message in her phone. She proceeds to say \"Oh the one from Mike?\" I confirm then she proceeds to say \"Oh he is just a friend you know that. I only love him as a friend\" I asked her if she considers that to be normal behaviour to be texting a \"friend\" damn near midnight to let him know that she loves him when she is laying next to me. Her rebutle was that she loves her friends and she was just letting him know. So I just said **ok** because I still did not believe what had just happened. Additionally, before addressing anything I just wanted to ask around from women I know if that was normal behaviour. She then shortly after got out of bed, showered and got ready probably the fastest I have ever seen her and left extremely early for work. You would have thought she was at least an hour late. We spent the whole day not talking which is unlike us until later in the afternoon when she sent funny video from IG like all is normal. I responded back with laughing emojis and that was it until we met back at home after work. Now we have another huge elephant in the room. Normally I am the one to bring things up that need to be addressed but today I couldn't get myself to do it because I just did not feel like being lied to. I didnt want to get hurt any further so we engaged in the most robotic small talk about work, then shortly after, I went into my home office to do some work. She then went to shower and straight to bed without saying goodnight.\n\nI am honestly at a crossroads and have no clue yet what my next move will be. I thinks I just need to know if it is normal for friends to say I love you to each other with heart emojis and all.\n\nPardon my typos.",

I do believe she could have shown you the messages and tried to reassure you rather than ignore your feelings about it and go about the day as if nothing has happened though. Anyways, that is not the biggest issue here.\n\nThe red flag is her lying about purchasing a second phone and not keeping you updated about this Tom situation. Lying this early on is a very bad sign for the rest of the relationship. Plus, if she cannot stand up to her ex, in my opinion she has no closure and is not ready for a new relationship. The fact that she doesn\u2019t broach any of the important topics and just ignores the issues you have also illustrates she is not invested enough and ready to make this work.\n\nIf I were you, I would not waste my time with someone who is not invested in the relationship.",

When they broke up she intended to go to the same college as me, but I transferred the same year. This caused the abrupt end. We have since both moved on with our lives and still remain friends albeit nowhere nearly as close and we no longer say \"I love you\". I may get an occasional message that says thank you with heart emoji's or similar but never the actual words. I feel that now that we truly ARE both only platonic that those words are no longer the same. I do care about her deeply, and if reasonable would do whatever I could to help her out. However, I will never say those words about her just to avoid any conflict in my relationship.

It doesn't even matter.\n\nKeeping in contact with any past sexual or romantic partner while in a relationship is a huge red flag in itself.\n\nYou need to just get the fuck out, I'm 99% sure. She's got so many red flags I can't even address them all. I'd be here all night. You've only got 6 months in with a girl in her thirties who's spent her entire adult life with a guy who she sneaks money to and won't break contact with. If you want to give her one more chance she needs to block and go hard no contact with all her exes and male friends regardless of whatever sad story they have going on. If she won't, block and no contact her. If she agrees, let her know that if you find out she so much as even ran into one them at a random gas station without immediately calling you, it's an immediate dumping even if you don't find out until 40 years have passed.\n\nBut she's so fucking hung up on Tom all he needs to do is decide he wants her back and she is gone before you can snap her fingers. He's her guy, her kryptonite she will never get over. She's swear up and down otherwise, but half the stories on the infidelity boards are girls running to their Tom when they have a fight, or are stressed, or don't get enough attention, or get told no, or just fucking can't resist the urge anymore. She needs to actively prove to you every day that she sh1ts on Tom and his memory for you to consider staying longer than it will take you to pack your stuff.\n\nPlus, you're 32. You should be dating someone in their mid 20's. WTF.",

And that includes healthy friendships. If you want your partner to end a ton of friendships not because the friendship became hurtful to the relationship but because of an arbitrary reason like gender, you are trying to hurt your partner. That is not how love looks like. That's how control looks like. \n\nI also have a genuine question: why do you think gender is not an arbitrary reason to not be ok with a friendship of a partner?",

My partner knows this and is completely comfortable and fine with that. I think he has also grown to love some of them as friends. My language also have words that somewhat distinguishes between platonic love and romantic love, which might make it a bit harder for me to get why saying I love you to your platonic friends is a no go for so many. \n\nHowever, her doing it in combo with continuing to \"lend\" thousands of dollars to her ex, even after you've talked about how it bothers and conserns you, shows a conserning lack of boundaries and ability to say no. She might not be cheating at all, but she cant put her foot down for shit and its hurting your relationship and you. \n\nYou cant keep dancing around this tho. You're waiting for her to bring it up, dont have the energy to talk about it because its too late or too early, waiting for her to adress the elephant in the room, when she deflects and acts normal you entertain it instead of keeping on track. I get wanting to see if she will be open and bring things to you. I think most of us just want out partners to prove us wrong when we worry about something, instead of having a talk that might show you that they wont rise to your hopes, needs and expectations. But its obvious that she wont, so continouing to do this will just drain you and the relationship. Have a sit down, put down some boundaries yourself, see if she will rise to the task or if you guys are just incompatible in these areas beyond what you can reconsile. What you're describing just sounds like a slow death, because none of you want to set clear lines and boundaries with other people.",

The thing is, it\u2019s rare there\u2019s a case he\u2019d actually leave the girl he\u2019s with for the girl he\u2019s emotionally/financially supporting. He just likes the attention and can\u2019t picture his life without it coming from these specific long-term sources. \n\nThe second example is just her being a good friend imo. I definitely wouldn\u2019t have found that action weird because brother friends stay in the brother bucket and I do love them and I don\u2019t have any boundaries around when we text each other. If they text every day all day, that\u2019s one thing. If this was the first time an exchange like this has ever happened in your presence, and she was reaching out for a clear specific reason, then I think you\u2019re reading way too much into it and it makes you look insecure. \n\nBut I understand WHY you\u2019d be insecure due to the first example. \n\nYou\u2019re not in the wrong to set a boundary around her relationship with her ex. If she can\u2019t agree to your boundary, then your best bet is to part ways. Because either she\u2019s not really ready to commit to a new relationship, or because this is just her personality and she will be this way forever and that\u2019s clearly not cool with you.\n\nI personally would never date (as a woman) someone who sets boundaries around my platonic friendships over something so ordinary as in the second example though. A lot of your comments about her having male friends put up some serious red flags tbh.",

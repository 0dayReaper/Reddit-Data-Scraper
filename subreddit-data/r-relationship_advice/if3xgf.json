    "postText": "TLDR: I don\u2019t want to be fetishized by my boyfriend but don\u2019t want to shame him for being more sexually open with me. \n\nWe\u2019ve been together for a little over a year now and it\u2019s been going well! We met at college through a club and hit it off then reconnected a couple years later. He\u2019s always been really kind to me and gives me compliments all the time and we generally have fun together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been quarantining together and have been having a lot of sex, which I love, but it\u2019s been getting a little weirder, I guess? He sends me a lot of hentai and says he wants to try things out that are depicted in it which is fine. But he\u2019s also been buying me outfits (which I do appreciate) and they\u2019re very much like anime themed? Japanese schoolgirl, cat-girl costume, etc. etc. I know he\u2019s being more open sexually with me but it all feels kind of... gross? Like he wants me to do all of these things because I\u2019m Asian? Anyway the other night he asked me to \u201cact cuter\u201d in the bedroom and to speak Japanese to him in bed. I was really offended by this because while I\u2019m Asian I\u2019m not Japanese. I\u2019m Taiwanese, but born and raised here in America. I firmly told him no and the night went on alright but he was a little quiet afterwards like I\u2019d scolded him. \n\nI don\u2019t think he means anything weird by it, but I want to tell him I\u2019m not okay with the things he\u2019s been doing but also I don\u2019t want to shame him for being more open sexually with me. I just want to feel like he wants to be intimate with ME and not with Asian Girl #7, if that makes sense. I don\u2019t know how to explain this to him though?",

It\u2019s why you have a convo about what you feel ok with in the bedroom (or the chandelier or the kitchen table lol no judgement).  Role play is great for some and not for others. They obviously like each other, they have sex together, they should be able to talk to each other about likes and dislikes. :)",

But still continue to speak Japanese. They're super into anime, fair enough I am too to a certain extent, but to the point that it becomes the only thing they are attracted to. \n\nHe is not attracted to you as a person. You are just a representation of a medium that he has fetishized. I would maybe try to understand if it stopped with outfits but he wants you to speak Japanese when you're Taiwanese?? It's not who you are. Do you think he would dump you if a Japanese girl was ever interested in him? Even if he did find a Japanese girl he probably wouldn't be attracted to her as a person either and would just want her to act more like anime girls.\n\nAlso pff wtf to he wants you to act \"cuter\". Stop this shit please, for your own self respect.",

Also, FYI, as the white party in a long-term IR relationship, your BF\u2019s behaviour is not acceptable. I knew from day one not to do that. Most people who succeed in inter-cultural or interracial relationships know not to do that. You need to sit him down and explain your boundaries ASAP. It almost never works out when one party expects the other to behave like a stereotype in the bedroom or elsewhere (unless both parties are very into it).",

We're both white and when we met we were both into anime but as I got older my interest in it faded while his only intensified. \n\nWhen we broke up he got HEAVILY into weeb culture. We were still friends at the time so I would go to cons with him occasionally and I can say that there is a substantial portion of white men who are into weeb stuff that are incredibly racist (not all are of course, please don't come at me with that \"not all men\" discourse). Being white I guess these dudes felt comfortable saying racist stuff around me and HOLY MOLY was the racial fetishization of asian women rampant within my ex's circles. Im going to go out on a limb and say that your boyfriend would probably fit in with them and that is it NOT kink shaming to feel uncomfortable or otherwise offended by his behavior (kinks ALWAYS operate with consent between two or more parties and if your boyfriend is fetishizing you without your consent you are NOT shaming him, you're setting a boundary). Please don't feel bad about feeling uncomfortable or angry at your boyfriend's behavior, it's dehumanizing and disrespectful and you deserve better OP",

Caucasian was also called Cacausoid.  The \"three races\" were used to highlight differences and part of the larger discussion based out of Europe to make Caucasoid better than the other two groups.  Mongoloid and Negroid were viewed as lesser.  Today, for example, Caucasoid/Caucasian is still a commonly used identifier, while Mongoloid is slang for someone who has some mental handicaps and Negroid is part of the root word for the n-word.",

I know it's bad either way, but I do know lots of people assume to know where we're from. Heck, I've had random (Asian) strangers come up and talk to me in Asian languages, especially older people who need directions. Or ask how Canada is different from Japan (I'm Singaporean). If he DID know where you're from and still asked you to speak Japanese in the bedroom, please don't look past it!

This is a little weird while you don't want to kink shame, anyone. He asks her to speak Japanese and dress up like a schoolgirl? Like wtf, she's not even Japanese she's Taiwanese how does he not know that about his own girlfriend? They need a serious discussion about boundaries too often people are fetishized for there race it's disgusting and not okay.",

The type of racism Asians face day to day never goes away.  Nurses don't face discrimination and even if they did, they could walk out in public and no one would know they are a nurse.\n\n&gt;People dont just decide on their kinks and ultimately its good that he feels comfortable sharing with you his kinks.\n\nYou're right, they don't just decide on them, they're often influenced by their own prejudices and society's prejudices.",

A lot of these girls in my sorority were your typical white girl. \u201cCoincidentally,\u201d the majority of these white girls just so happened to have a strong preference for white men, some even going as far as to say \u201cI\u2019m don\u2019t date people of color because I\u2019m not attracted to them.\u201d\n\nDo you genuinely think it\u2019s just some coincidence that all of these individuals just randomly inherited this preference for white men?!? Or is it more likely that their preference has been shaped by bias and cultural attitudes about attraction???\n\nSure, people are welcome to their preferences. But I also really challenge people to evaluate how their preferences developed and where they\u2019re stemming from. \n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so concerning that OPs boyfriend wants his Asian girlfriend to act Japanese and Kawaii. He wasn\u2019t born just having some inherent fetish for anime/Japanese stuff. This was influenced somewhere. And the fact that he just expects his Asian girlfriend to be able to speak Japanese on command is concerning and shows some red flags that he\u2019s not viewing her as a person with her own culture, but rather an object to fulfill his fetish.\n\nIs he having sexual with you for who you are, your identity, and all that comes with it? Or is he having sex to get himself off to a Japanese school girl and you\u2019re the closest he can find that resembles that?",

Kinks are absolutely fine, especially if you talk about it before him, but if hes just expecting you to act like a japanese hentai/anime when you're not even Japanese and you didnt even have a conversation about it before hand that's pretty shitty.\n\nI'm a 28m white american and that'd be like if my girlfriend whispered in my ear during sex to act like a German and dominate her or something. I'm all down for trying roleplay and kinks, but that's a little weird to drop on someone and just expect randomly.\n\nHave a conversation with him about how it makes you feel, communication is everything. If you get it all out in the open it could be something you guys could find common interest on and experiment with, but from the context you gave it definitely sounds like fetishizing and it sounds like that's bothering you so you should definitely talk about it.",

Don\u2019t let yourself be fetishized because then that means he doesn\u2019t really care about your feelings or anything else besides the fact that you\u2019re Asian. \n\nI\u2019ve told my friend the same and she\u2019s ok with it because she\u2019s not serious about the guy she\u2019s seeing. I assume you\u2019re in it for the long haul and if he\u2019s seeing you as just a hot Asian girl he scored and not a woman he genuinely loves because you\u2019re kind, caring, good hearted etc, then it\u2019s a lost cause.",

If my boyfriend wants me to do something sexual and I don\u2019t wanna do it, I say no and we continue with other stuff we\u2019re both comfortable with. Same if I wanted him to do something. It\u2019s not weird and no one gets mad or down about it. \n\nOPs bf acting like this is a red flag",

You\u2019ve already voiced that this isn\u2019t something you are interested in and as your boyfriend, he should respect that. He\u2019s fetishizing your race which to me as a black women is very disrespectful and offensive. If he cannot understand that, then he just isn\u2019t it sis.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve been with my husband (33 male) for 18years and married for 8of those years. My husband cheated on me a lot when we use to date but has been great since we got married. I just recently learned (back in December) that he had been yet again, unfaithful. We were having a lot of problems in our marriage when he told me about his infidelity (probably fr guilt and wanting to get it off his chest) but swore it was from before we were married. I did some digging and the timeline was off, it was during our marriage. I confronted him and he froze, then he said nothing happened, and that he actually made the whole thing up. He has asked me to forgive him but I just can\u2019t seem to.\n\nHere is my dilemma, he is the best husband, minus the unfaithfulness. This man is a good father, generous lover, cooks, cleans, works hard, handy, tells me I\u2019m beautiful every day, can\u2019t keep his hands off me, sex every other day, patient, smart, kind, loving, great to my family, treats me like a queen, spoils me rotten, sweet, charming, witty, and gives me daily massages. He is about perfect, but can\u2019t seem to stay faithful to me.\n\nI am also great. I\u2019ve been different since I found out, so I am currently not great BUT before I was everything he asked for. I cooked three course meals, cleaned, devoted mother and wife, sex on demand (when, where, how, even all the kinky stuff), made my own money, have my own business, worked out, played sports, smart, kind, loving, generous, and devoted my whole life to him.\n\nSo what happened?\n\nHe cheated on me at the worst possible time in my life. I was in the best shape of my life, then I had two strokes, was severely sick with our second child, had to have an abortion, and was recovering from the physical and mental damage.\n\nI am no longer in love with him but I am not sure what to do. We at perfect together, all we need now if money.\n\nAny theories and/or advice on why this happened, what to do, or how to prevent this fr happening again if I stay. Thank you.",

If I was in a relationship with someone like your husband and I learned that they had cheated on me my boundary would be that I will not be speaking to him and that they should leave the house because I need therapy and a divorce lawyer to tell me what my options are. Stop listening to this person who lies and cheats to you of course they are going to tell you what you want to hear. Worst case scenario this man actually knows he's using you and keeps you trapped in this marriage for financial reasons. Best case scenario he has a mental illness that he needs to deal with and psychological problems from childhood and staying with him is not going to help him hit rock bottom and get help. You leave him and he doesn't go to therapy and he continues to just have sex with women? This will give you the answer that he was never going to change anyway",

And it was the weirdest conversation in my entire life, where he seemed to be confused about my questions. He said that it was what men were supposed to do, that it was normal and, \"what kind of men will he be if he didn't had mistresses\". \n\nThen, I started to notice some things in his side of family. And they were \"gently\" mocking my male cousin for being faithfull to his long term gf and asking him if he will cook for her. Like it was a bad thing to do. \n\nI realised that my dad was just raised with this weird view on how to be a man. With whine at the table since he's 14 and pressure to have many sexual partners. It's sad because I'm pretty sure he would have been a descent man without all that crazyness.",

I'm guessing this because he was doing it early on in your relationship, and then partially admitted to it, but then backed off immediately when you figured out that it actually happened during your marriage. \n\nAs for preventing, if I'm right, there's nothing you can really do to prevent it from happening again.",

If he can't honor you when you were at your most vulnerable point, what makes you think he will ever?\n\n&gt;he is the best husband, minus the unfaithfulness\n\nThis is nonsensical. A relationship is not a math equation where as long as you have a greater positive value than negative values, it's overall a positive relationship. You need to consider all aspects of an individual and not just ignore the bad parts.\n\nOverall, if you stay you can expect to receive the same treatment he's provided over the past 18 years. That should be pretty obvious. So if you don't want to be cheated on more going forward, then you should leave.",

He\u2019s cheated on you and been forgiven before, and I assume he realized how hurt it made you before.\nEven with all of that, he cheated. Then he lied again when confronted.\n\nCombined with all the cheating at the beginning of your relationship, this is a lifelong pattern.\nMy brother in law sounds exactly like you described your husband - he has every single nice quality you said. He\u2019s an incredible boyfriend while around his significant other.\nHowever, he truly can\u2019t be faithful. He has cheated on every woman he\u2019s ever been with, multiple times, even those he really loved.\n\nYour husband is not going to change his behavior.\nThis is a lifelong pattern and cycle. 18 years of infidelity. He likely never stopped when you got married, he just got better at hiding it. From this point forward if you take him back, he\u2019ll likely just become more covert and cover his tracks better, without stopping the infidelity.\n\nYou deserve loyalty. You deserve respect and honesty. You deserve to get out of a relationship what you\u2019re putting in.\nYou can\u2019t keep pouring into a cup with leaks in it.\n\nI\u2019m sorry to say this I really am, but if you were my sister or friend I\u2019d tell you to file for divorce and put your foot down. There are consequences to his actions. It\u2019s not about punishing him, but at this point he won\u2019t learn the lesson any other way. Sadly, most men let good women get away and don\u2019t realize until it\u2019s much too late. \n\nYou have so much going for you, I truly think you\u2019ll find someone better. Or even be happier being alone without all the stress of worrying constantly if he\u2019s being truthful. \n\n\u201cEvery time you forgive someone, they love you a little more and you love them a little less, until there\u2019s no love left.\u201d \n\nBest of luck\u2764\ufe0f",

You're gonna hate to hear this, OP...but you're not going to find the magic answer you want. Deep down, as much as you hate being cheated on, you're scared to let him go and you're hoping to find some sort of answer that will give you the peace of mind you want without having to make the difficult choice of possibly leaving your husband. \n\nLike others have said, there's nothing you can do to make him stop. If he hasn't stopped before then he's not ever gonna stop. I've been there. I cried, I pleaded, I got angry, I tried being understanding but in the end I realized how f*cked up it was that I was the only one going through the mental anguish of picking of up the pieces of our relationship after each time I caught him cheating.\n\nYou've already shown him that you'll stay with him despite the hurt it causes. Are you okay with being with  someone who deliberately hurts you so long as he keeps the same lovable qualities that you listed above? Trust me, no answer will be easy but you're the one who has to live with your choice so be kind to yourself. Hugs \ud83d\udc95",

But it is a recipe for failure.  Against all odds, I think you must either rebuild the marriage - or leave it.  Dwelling in the ruins is a tragic waste of years of your life.\n\nRebuilding is a fake-it-til-you-make-it deal, where you take your pain and doubt to a confidant, clergy or counselor, and show only positivity to your unfaithful and undeserving husband, up to and including giving him the love you no longer feel inside.  This should help improve the odds that he won't cheat again, which is well short of prevention, but substantially better than nothing.\n\nAs for theories, you describe his cheating as occurring while you were in a horrible state.  Therefore I would advise you - just as I would advise ANYONE - to invest time, effort, and even money that you may have to borrow, in self-care, both mental and physical.  I know the SOB promised \"in sickness and in health\" but like Job's wife, he evidently has no appetite for challenges.  If this is his weakness, then play to his strength, improve your odds, and get his best.  Unfair?  Hell yeah.  Best I can do with Stay.",

There may be a slightly more perfect man out there for you.

Not just to cheat, but also to not trust you and not respect you. \nHe could have chosen to go to therapy instead of cheating.\nHe could have chosen not to get into a monogamous relationship, if he wants to sleep with more than one woman. \nHe could have chosen to trust and respect you, and talk to you if you would be willing to open the relationship and go from there.\nBut he didn't, he chose not to trust and respect you.

Once they are forgiven and they realize that you will work it out with them a lot of times, and another difficult situation they will cheat again. I did have a friend that did something that worked but I\u2019m just gonna tell you what it is. It\u2019s up to you.\n\nHe went to an attorney he got divorce, papers, drawn up. He also got custody papers drawn up. He took half of the savings out of the bank account and put it into an account that only he could access at the time.    \n\nThen he had a friend come over to his house to act as witness. I would pack him a bag. And when he comes over or home, I would tell him he needs to leave. You\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re going to stay with him. That you have drawn up divorce papers and custody papers and you want out of the marriage. Make sure while you\u2019re doing this. You also print out some evidence put it from your phone into the computer and print it out or at least have it on your phone saved someplace else in case he deletes it from your phone. Sometimes they do that. \n\nWith your friend there with you, you provide him with proof you tell him you\u2019re cheating on me at the worst possible time in my life I\u2019ve had two strokes, and I am carrying your baby and you\u2019re cheating on me. I don\u2019t think I want to stay in the marriage so you need to leave here a divorce papers and I have proof of your infidelity. I need you to leave while I decide what I\u2019m going to do. \n\nIt does two things number one, it sets a boundary that says I\u2019m not going to live with a cheater and if we have any hope you are going to have to change. Also make him stay away for a while while you decide what you\u2019re doing and I\u2019m talking a month or more. And then while your friend is there, you have him take his bag and leave the house. The next day you have a locksmith change the locks so he can\u2019t get back in.\n\nI know this sounds severe, but the only other thing I would tell you to do in this case is leave him because he will cheat again and you\u2019re right. He did this to you at your lowest possible moment when you needed him the most. He is not a trustworthy man and he is not a good husband. He is a cheater, and he will cheat again. \n\nI do know a couple that did this and it worked for them they\u2019re still together in fact they had another baby and they\u2019ve been together for years since it happened. But most of the time these things don\u2019t work out just so you know.",

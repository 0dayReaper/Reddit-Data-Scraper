    "postText": "Well the title says it all she went there with some friends and they got naked and stayed there for the day or so. It makes me uncomfortable and kind of disgusted, I see being naked as part of intimacy (maybe that's wrong?) and she's the only person I would be comfortable being naked with. \nAlso I feel kind of an asshole because at the end of the day it's her body her choice what to do with it and I don't want to tell her what not to do\nI already talked with her and she says there's nothing wrong with it and my ideas about it are wrong. \nI think anyway she'd want to do it again and I kind of wish she wouldn't expose so easily in front of her friends and strangers \nWhat should I do? Is it just a mental block for me?\n\nTLDR\nMy gf went to a nudist beach and it makes me uncomfortable",

It happens all the time but it\u2019s up to you whether or not you can change your views. Maybe next time if she wants to go, join her and see what it\u2019s all about to see her side.

Of course \"most\" does not mean \"all\".\n\nHowever, do not shame her or anything. This is how she is, and it is not acceptable so you just break up with her. Nothing more nothing less. No negotiations or accusations should be spoken. You are incompatible, simple as that.",

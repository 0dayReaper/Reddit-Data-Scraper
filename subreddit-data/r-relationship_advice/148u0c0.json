    "postText": "i (21F) and my partner (21M) are having a problem that seems to grow bigger each day, which happens to be sex and i\u2019m sure i either am somewhere on the asexual spectrum or demisexual one i\u2019m not very immersed into either so i\u2019m a bit ignorant. all i know is that i hardly have a sex drive but that doesn\u2019t mean i don\u2019t have one at all, it\u2019s just rarely there and i\u2019ve expressed this to my partner and he has an opposing sex drive which is fairly high and i don\u2019t seem to be able to meet it. \n\nhe doesn\u2019t force me to do anything by i feel like he\u2019s been trying to set that mood and because i cannot force myself to get into that sort of mood out of a spur he seems to have resulted in directly asking now such as \u201cwanna have sex tn?\u201d or \u201cwanna have sex\u201d and it puts me in a weird place that i\u2019m not doing enough and i feel bad about it. i\u2019m not sure what to do as he doesn\u2019t want to force me into anything and i do not and cannot do that, as i have extreme trauma with r word as a kid and teenager as well as being continuously sexualized as a minor by women and men so i find it hard to provide in this aspect as i am a more emotional and mental sort of individual when it comes to love languages. \n\ni\u2019ve communicated this and had various of multitudes of conversations and sit downs with my partner to find a way we can meet in the middle and cater for each other. but the problem persists, and only grows for him as he gets sad about it and depressed and begins to overthink and i\u2019ve suggested an open relationship but he was offended i had done so and as well masturbation and porn and have even gave him lewd videos and pictures of myself yet he told me he hates that idea and i\u2019m unsure of what to do and how to proceed now. \n\ntoday i found him looking at lewd girls profiles on facebook and tiktok that show their bits but it confuses me whether that counts as porn or not or if that\u2019s a completely different thing? if anyone could give me some perspective please i\u2019d appreciate it !!",

It can be difficult to tell whether the lack of sex drive comes from the trauma or asexuality.\n\nFor the time being though, it sounds like you're not sexually compatible with your partner, and that not your or his fault. You definitely shouldn't be pressured into sex when you don't want it, and he's also allowed to want to be with someone has a sex drive closer to his. If this isn't resolved then it can cause resentment to grow in a relationship, as you're probably already experiencing now.",

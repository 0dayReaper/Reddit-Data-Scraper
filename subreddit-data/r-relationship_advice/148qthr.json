    "postText": "Hello, another story of a friend(19yo), so basically he was in a 1/1.5 year relationship and he broke up with his girlfriend(18yo) because of a trauma. To briefly summarise, they were chilling in front of netflix and she started to tease him. He became hard and wanted to do what people who really love each others do.\n\n But she actually didn't want to go further and it reminded her a trauma where she got raped by her stepbrother when she was younger. (he was confused and kinda insisted for 1 minute). After that their relationship degraded a lot and they almost didn't talk for a month, so my friend decided to leave her. They didn't talk to each other for two weeks and met again, apparently they are still in love, kissed but are still talking.\r  \nHowever, she tried to hook up with a random guy at a bar during these two weeks. Also, she said to have done that to \"forget the trauma of the childhood rape she had\", by hooking up with another guy.\n\nWhat's your opinion about that, my friend could use some advice here because he feels guilty about this whole situation, what do you think ?",

While the context of what happened in the bar isn't known here, or maybe irl too, your friend was being pushy about it for a minute, and maybe that behavior right there reminded her of what happened to her growing up, whereas in the bar, maybe she was looking for it.",

            "comment": "I feel like this can be worked out within the relationship if both parties are willing to talk it out from an honest place.\n\nThat said being a survivor of that and worse by family I can also say I have made impulsive choices like that after breakups. I felt like if someone isn't going to accept the very real feeling of having your autonomy stolen from you is traumatic, then that actually hurts. \"Time to cut the loss and get back to doing what I want.\"\n\nSo both sides are seemingly talking past each other. The fact he for even 1 minute pushed when no was the answer was likely a super harmful response for the relationship and her own internal world. Perhaps it was even a violation of trust depending how fiercely she values that.\n\nMy now fiancee made a comment toward me once that way and I broke up with them for a little. What made me come back and what ultimately made it work was concerted effort between us to repair the rift caused by those actions.\n\nSo it depends, but time and legitimate effort from both parties is really the only way this gets fixed properly in all likelihood if staying together is the goal.",

    "postText": "For some back story, we met on tinder and originally decided on being friends. We really hit it off, having the same incredibly niche music tastes, the same dark humor, and oddly specific hobbies. \n\nPretty soon things got intimate and we ended up hooking up. We only hooked up once and stayed in an odd but fun homoerotic friendship for 3 months. Near the end things started getting more emotional but just a few weeks ago he got cold out of nowhere and stopped responding to my texts, opting to add songs to our shared playlist as a response instead which just makes no sense to me. I also saw that he updated his tinder profile. This was very frustrating as I was just a day away from telling him about my romantic feelings for him. I didn\u2019t text him again since I know he tends to be an avoidant person and I would hate to smother him.\n\nWe shared so much in common that he ended up seeping into every crevice of what makes me an individual(writing that out, that\u2019s probably what drove him away since he values his independence so highly). I just can\u2019t get him off my mind and memories of him stain all of the things I do and all the music i listen to to make myself happy. I even feel awful having to watch his listening activity pop up on my spotify.\n\nSpring quarter is ending now and I really want to thank him for teaching me how to develop/print my own film photos this year. I\u2019ve accepted that closure may be out of the question but I want to check up on him to see how he\u2019s doing. Would it be weird to text him or send him a snap after nearly 4 weeks of no contact? So far he\u2019s left 2 of my texts without a response and I don\u2019t know how well i could take a third. I also don\u2019t want to come off as weird or clingy but I care a lot for him! Even just as friend!",

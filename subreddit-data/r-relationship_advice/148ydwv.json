    "postText": "I\u2019m 24 and have been with my 34yo for two years. I was so in love with him, made the first move, etc. He treats me so well, loves me, would never hurt me. I live with him, at his place.\n\nBut I\u2019ve been slowly catching feelings for my lesbian best friend who\u2019s 27. She\u2019s in a relationship, which wasn\u2019t great at first but now they\u2019re doing good. I even kind of helped them fixing their relationship. She doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m apparently into girls as well. \n\nIdk what to do. I love her so much but doing anything about it will hurt everyone involved. I feel so stuck and guilty.\n\nWorst thing is she wants us to be roommates for the coming year. So I feel like I have to say something because there is no way this will end well. Oh and on top of that we kind of do freelance work together and just got a big project to work on. I just don\u2019t know what to do. I have no place of my own so I can\u2019t just leave my boyfriend, that I still love I think, just like that.\n\nShould I tell her? Should I leave my boyfriend for a crush, although I still have some feelings for him?",

You can be respectful of your partner and their boundaries. You can be respectful of your BFF and their partnership. You don't have to ruin anything for anyone.\n\nYou mentioned moving in. I think it's safe to say that you already know that's not a good decision. You are, after all, in a relationship and have considerably warmed towards your BFF. Are you capable of never speaking nor acting on your feelings so long as all parties remain otherwise engaged? Not even a \"mistaken kiss mishap\" or getting jealous when you hear her and her partner going at it hot and heavy in the next room?  Yeah, I don't think you should move in together.\n\nIf you are so far along that you can hardly contain these feelings, then you should let your current relationship go. It's unfair to them to be uninformed of these changes and not to be able to decide if they want to stick around while you are pining for your BFF. Also, I don't think it is wise to say anything to your BFF, not even a slip. She is in a relationship, and it is not your place to divert her attention from it at all.",

(You don't have to tell me, just answer in your head lol) It is possible to fall for people and not their genders. \u2665 This might help you determine if you are bi-leaning overall. So if you feel you would like someone to talk to about this, she might be a fantastic person to approach on this. However, do not express that you are attracted to her. Giving her hints that you want her is not respecting her or her existing relationship or her partner. Just generalize, that will help you skirt the actuality.  \nAlso, I think you should talk to your partner. I think something is off there, your post doesn't even really consider him much. If you should let him go, then let him go. You don't have to hold onto a relationship that doesn't fit who you are anymore. But who knows, maybe you will fall back *in love* with him if you two start communicating better and your relationship can meet more of your needs. Maybe in this relationship you can explore that bi tickle with his consent. Don't know til you begin communicating with him. Best of luck to you!",

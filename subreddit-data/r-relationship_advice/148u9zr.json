    "postText": "My little brother (20m) died about a month and a half ago, tragically in a car accident. My husband didn\u2019t know him much, and my husband has not lost anyone close to him, no grandparents, no friends, nobody. I\u2019ve lost my dad and now my little brother. And about two weeks after my little brother died, I had to move across the country to a new place because of my husbands duty station. So I\u2019m in a new place, no friends, no job, no family who gets what I\u2019m going through. Since losing my brother, I\u2019ve had such a loss of motivation, and a deep feeling of despair, especially at night time. And my anxiety has gotten really bad. But I keep pushing through and try to not show my emotions, because he doesn\u2019t get it and he keeps trying to get me to stop from crying but I need to grieve this loss. \nI\u2019ve been applying to job after job and no call backs and it\u2019s been a month of applying online, following up in person, etc. to like 30+ jobs. I feel like the universe is kicking me while I\u2019m down and I\u2019ve got nothing good going on. I feel so bad that I can\u2019t even describe it. But still I try to joke with my husband, try to hang out with him, do stuff, etc. but he came to me today complaining that I am not giving him the attention and love that he needs. And I get it. You need to feel loved, but I told him that I\u2019ve got nothing left to give. I\u2019m giving everything I can. I\u2019m trying the best I can to try and move forward but I\u2019ve got nobody but him. And maybe that is exhausting, but I don\u2019t even share my emotions with him because the few times I do, he just shuts me down. He doesn\u2019t get it and I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s expecting me to just be okay. So what can I do, in this time, to give him what he needs?",

I can't imagine losing a sibling.\n\nInstead of worrying about him, maybe figure out what *you* need.  It has to be really difficult in a strange place with no family or friend support, and having all this trouble getting a job.  It even puts your husband in a tough spot.  It doesn't sound like he's handling this ideally, but it's also hard on someone when they're the only support system.  \n\nWould it help if you flew back home for a few months?   It would just be to regroup, get that support you need and maybe get into a better emotional situation.",

He doesn't need to have lost someone close to him to understand that *you did* and you need HIS support more than he needs yours in this time. \n\nHas he always been this selfish? Is this a pattern of behavior? Does he always put his wants above your needs? \n\nYou should be allowed to express emotions in a healthy adult relationship. And right now, the way you're describing this relationship, it's definitely toxic and honestly probably divorce-worthy if this is a pattern of behavior.",

Go for a walk and just let your mind be a peace. Talk to your brother and tell him how much you miss him ect. Have full blown conversations. Tell him about your life ect. \n\nTry to make an effort to get up every day, take a shower and eat breakfast, make it a ritual between that and walking.  Maybe toss in reading the paper while you eat breakfast.\n\nIf you have a resume, try  going on [fiver.com](https://fivver.com) and have someone look at your resume and give you suggestions on how to make it better ect.\n\nAs for your husband, he needs to be patient and understanding. If he isn't, sit him down and have a serious conversation about how he isn't giving you what you need at the moment and that your give a shit factor is literally at bottom. He needs to let you cry it out and at some point, you will stop. It is OK to be sad. Give yourself permission to feel it. \n\nRight now, your husband needs to be more supportive, not wanting you to give him more attention. Tell him to back off a bit.\n\nAt night, I suggest you start a ritual. Take a hot bath, have a cup of hot tea, grab a book and read until it is time to go to bed. It will keep your mind occupied.\n\nI am so sorry you are going through this and I am sorry you lost your brother. \n\nThings will get better, there will still be lots of tears but it will get better. Just hang in there.",

Its mostly a few sessions of group therapy but wow, it was so great to talk with people who \"get it\" .   It may vary depending on your area but call a funeral hope and they will direct you regardless if you used them or not. Or since your husband is in the military medical facility.\n\nYou need to grieve and take care of yourself and since your husband is not helping you need help elsewhere. You can deal with his insensitivity later. Although I might tell him now exactly how you feel so he cant say later \"I had no idea\".",

I know this can be hard when dealing with grief, but you have to also remember that your husband can\u2019t ever make anything better when it comes to that, all he can do is try to reassure you and make you feel more comfortable. The only thing that will be able to take the pain away is time. Time heals all wounds, in the mean time what I believe you can do is remind yourself that your brother now lives on through you. I also suggest couples therapy or maybe even one on one therapy. Your man could use some pointers on how to help you grieve.. despite me thinking his heart is in the right place he needs to do a better job at being a support system for you during this trying time and I guarantee that the love will pour out of you. I think right now there\u2019s a lot of tension cause you see him as not really helping you or understanding you. Couples Therapy would be a great way for you guys to figure that out. This is a rough time in your life and it\u2019s really important that he can step up emotionally. You need him. Besides that what are you goals ?",

You don't have to have lost someone personally to be an empathetic person and a helpful, supportive and loving partner. It's times like these when you're at your lowest that you learn whether or not you can count on your partner to lift you up. Instead all he's doing is complaining that you're not giving him enough attention? \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss. If you can, are you able to get back and spend some time with your family? That might give you an opportunity for healing that you're not getting where you are now, and give you some perspective on your relationship once you're in a better headspace.",

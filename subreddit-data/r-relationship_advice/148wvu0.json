    "postText": "I found out my boyfriend slept with this guy and I got so upset and hurt I messaged the guy he cheated with and he said \u201clmao no one cares about you please kys\u201d. That really upset me more and then I remembered how homophobic he tries to act in front of everyone. He doesn\u2019t know me and I don\u2019t know him but I\u2019ve seen him around online before. I told people he knows and some of his family heard about it and now they all hate him. I saw where people where commenting on his social media and calling him slurs. He deserved it for ruining my life. I loved my boyfriend and I feel like I can\u2019t live without him even though we\u2019ve only been dating 6 months. I\u2019m not going to let someone ruin my life. And then be nasty to me also and tell me to off myself? I knew my boyfriend has bisexual but I didn\u2019t expect this. What do I do now?",

But retaliating that way ultimately does not make you feel better and I hope you know that now. I hope you can move forward and find someone who actually appreciates and loves you. Getting your heart broken sucks, I know. It's terribly painful. But what I learned from it is that it helped me define what I wanted from a partner in the future.

Don\u2019t throw stones if you live in a glass house. Surely he should have thought you outing him out of spite was an option. I also have very little compassion for closed gay people saying homophobic things. \n\nBut it\u2019s very possible that you did ruin his life or at least his relationship with his friends and family. It doesn\u2019t sound like any of them is very tolerant. And what for? A boyfriend that you were together with for a few months and was a cheater anyway. If it wasn\u2019t with this particular guy, he would have probably cheated with someone else. Also, I know you love him but please break up with him. He will cheat again.",

            "comment": "Go to therapy.  You need to work on yourself.  You attach way too much of your self worth to the person you are dating and its really not a serious relationship yet (6 months).  Getting cheated on is devastating but your life is far from over.  People survive infidelity all the time. It's not the end.\n\nTherapy will help you process your emotional grief in a healthy way and can also work on your self-esteem issues.\n\n~~I'm honestly not sure how to feel about outing that guy. One one hand, the world is a hateful, dangerous place to anyone that doesn't fit the \"CIS, hetero-mold\" and you could have put this person's safety in jeopardy.  On the other hand, the guy is an obvious ahole and idiot.  It would have cost him nothing to be polite, even just act polite.  Instead he decided to rub salt in your wounds and frankly, how could he not have seen this coming?  Anyone would have retaliated and would have used the easiest method possible, his sexuality, to do it.  Hopefully he will survive, but given his ahole-ness and idiocy I doubt he will be any wiser for it.  The odds are against him given the bad combo of ahole, idiot, and his sexuality.~~\n\nEdit: you outed a kid. I feel sickened by what you did.",

    "postText": "So I 23M am in love with my roommate 22F, we went to nursing school together, but we were both living with our parents during that time. That said she got kicked out of her parents one day, and I was looking for a place to live so I asked her if she wanted to team up to find a place. She said yes and we began looking for property in the city and rented one out together; she's an amazing woman as I've grown to find out. We both love science fiction, and we both want to be authors one day; we've been supporting each other throughout the process and because she inspired me I finished the first draft for a fantasy novel. It's pretty much Harry Potter but instead of it being a school for wizards It's a school for thieves, and It's set in a medieval fantasy world that doesn't exist. I'm writing the second draft now, and I've been trying to provide encouragement and support to her to do the same.She's an amazing cook, I had my first patient death and she cooked me an amazing pasta; she also put a hot chocolate by my bedside the next morning. \n\nThen she sat by a chair and she read me Dune while we both pet her cat, I started falling for her after that moment despite not having any real feelings. She is conventionally attractive don't get me wrong, but I think that was when I properly fell in love with her since then she was often the first person I've thought of when I woke up in the morning and the last person I'd think of before falling asleep. I just don't think I'm good enough for her, for starters her dating history kinda indicates that her most recent ex who I met during nursing school was a 6'2 footy player who was fit and attractive. Her exes are usually this archetype because we've talked about relationships and stuff before, she knows I'm very inexperienced since I've only really been on one date in HS that turned out to be a prank.I just don't see why she would choose me, I'm overweight, I'm only around 5'10 at most on a good day, I've started going on a diet for a chance. \n\nNot to mention I don't exactly make a lot of money, but at the same time my feelings are driving me crazy, there are times where I think she might possibly like me. But at the same time, it could just be friends acting like friends, Idk what to do about this I'm scared she's going to think that I'm a creep for thinking I have a chance with her or something. What do you guys think I should do about how I feel? There was a time when we were watching a movie and my hand rested on top of hers, and she didn't pull away, but I could be reading into that too much. ",

It sounds like she doesn\u2019t have the same feelings as you and she\u2019s just being a really good roommate. Really good roommates are hard to find and should be treasured. Continue your diet, put yourself out there for connections with others.",

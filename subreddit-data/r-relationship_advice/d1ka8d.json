    "postText": "It has not been that long but i need again advice from you guys about the same topic.\n\n[^((Original Post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cyh5cv/wife_38f_is_convinced_that_she_is_pregnant_even/)^()^) \n\nI called up our primary doctor and told him about the problem . He seemed very concerned and wanted us to come see him the next morning .  He said it was important to be gentle but not feed into her delusions. I sat her down and we talked. All she wanted to talk about is when i would get the nursery started and that we were on a time crunch, and how she has found a perfect color for the room, how she wants me to be more involved in her pregnancy . I tried to be very calm but i was very perturbed by seeing her that way. I asked her to go to the doctor with me tommorow. She said yes, that she wanted to check on the babies either ways. Now i took some advice and words you gave me about being calm and asking a bit why she think she is pregnant without calling her delusional . So I did. She kept changing subjects or saying that \" A mother just feels it. You wouldn't know how it is \" then i said that i loved her really much that i would never think of leaving her but we needed to go to the doctor to confirm her \"gut feeling \". She got very agitated and was crying telling me that if I wanted to leave her i should simply leave but I shouldn't call her a liar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomehow i managed to calm her down enough for her to go to sleep.\n\nAfter she did i went on her computer. I do **never** snoop on her. But i remembered a commenter pointing out forums about cryptic pregnancy and so i went for the look out . Oh boy. She was in 2 facebook groups. One was a normal Mommy facebook group and the other was a group about women that believed they were pregnant. In the \"normal\" group she would post updates about her symptoms and pictures of her \"belly\" and her story about how she was almost not able to have children but thats to the \"grace of god that kissed her tummy\" the \"gift of life was given to her \" and how she was compensated for all this years of suffering with twins. in the other group the women were quite literally, and exuse me here , fucking insane. They were feeding in each others delusions. A woman said that she was almost 2 years pregnant and how sometimes it just takes longer. My wife would post there complaining about doctors that do not take her seriously and about me. So many women were making her fear that i would leave. Saying things like men can not stick to a woman . Many recounted their stories about how their marriages broke down because their spouses could not \"handle the pregnancy\".\n\nI was really fucking scared. I researched phantom pregnancies and i read somewhere that that could also be a sign of [schizophrenia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3361851/). So to say the least i could not sleep. I was and am still very afraid of losing her. She woke up and I tried to act like nothing was wrong . We were going to the doctor. And it was as if nothing had happened yesterday. She was convinced that we were going to a pregnancy check up. Things got really bad when we began talking to the doctor. He was really tactful when talking to my wife. He tried to explain her that it was medically impossible that she was pregnant. We tried to show her tests, the ultrasound we did the day before but nothing. She got more agitated and began to cry and the scream at me for making her look like a crazy person . She began bouncing back and forth and holding her head with both hands . We could not calm her she went in on a full on panic attack . She could not breathe. The doctor laid her down and tried giving her some  medicine for her to relax but it did not help as he didn't have the necessary tools to treat a panic attack that was that bad . She had to go to the hospital where they took care of her. Did an EKG to exclude that she was suffering a heart attack.\n\nAt that point i really had no other option than to inquire about Involuntary commit. So I could not do it myself . I needed my doctors statement that she was a danger to herself and others and he had to initiate the process of an involuntary examination of 72 hours . After that we will have to submit a written statement to the court to determine wether on not she can stay there \"against her will\". So far i have submitted all her posts in both facebook groups aswell as the test we did with timestamps when possible . My wife is 2 days in the 3 days examination and i have no contact to her. When i last her she was furious with me. She said i was taking away her freedom which I am. i fell horrible, dirty and useless. She is so mad at me. I feel like I am abandoning her and don't know how she will ever forgive me this. I love her with all my heart. I am afraid of what will happend if the courts decide that i can't commit her, how our life will be affected . I feel like i failed to protect her. At this point I am just rambeling . Sorry for the long post i guess i just need to vent because i have no one else to really turn to that just wants to listen . I feel judged by everyone and pittied ... i just hate it . Sorry for spelling mistakes\n\n**edit : I will not fuckin leave my wife you unempathetic dickheads! When I gave my vows I meant trough illness and bad times. I am not only on the ride for the good times. If you truly love somone you will do whatever it takes to see them healthy again. Would you leave your spouse if they went trough a severe physical illnes?? I am here to stay. I will not divorce her. She is not a \"fucking psycho\" she is sick. I hope no one of your loved ones ever has to go trough this because their support net will consist of cowardly dickheads.**\n\nSorry for the rant. But if you want to say something line divorce that nut don't even bother. I understand people that make the choice to leave if the situation when it Beginns to mess with their mental health  and I respect that but I won't do that.\n\nEdit 2: my wife didn't have a heart attack. She was examined because panic attacks register with similar symptoms as heart attacks\n\nI don't exactly know what our doctor gave her as I was so distraught. But I was not a sedative. I think it was something along the lines of Valium or Baldrian. Over the counter stuff mostly.\n\nShe has family. She is estranged from most of them. Her sister is now at our place to help.\n\nAlso refrain from such stupid comments like \"I'll bet she will leave bro. She is cray how did you marry her\" because they are not helpful at all. Specially the bets that are going on that my wife will leave me once she gets better. Just seems like you want me to divorce. Get a life.",

He has PTSD and I got a phone call at work 40 minutes away in a different county that he loved me and that I shouldn't feel bad. I had to call 911 bawling my eyes out knowing he was having a bad week and then call the emergency line for the county he was in (they connect you to the nearest one) when the police broke the door down he was in the bathroom, he hid the razor before he came out. He was SO MAD AT ME. He hated me. He wanted a divorce. He never wanted to see me again. And to be honest I was pretty angry too not because of his mental illness but because I felt so helpless. I want to say after a week of the adjusted meds. He called apologizing. He told me how thankful he was that I had called. He was thankful that I didn't budge on him being committed. He was thankful that he had someone who knew him well enough to know that he wasn't \"manipulating\" me. (He had been pushing me away which is a sign or being suicidal and we had been fighting a lot because of it) you did the right thing OP. You definitely have done the right thing for her well being no matter how angry she is now. Shell see it one day.",

He was a typical paranoid schizophrenic, he alienated just about everyone he knew except for myself and the other people who realised he was very sick (even then they avoided him). He thought he was better than them, that they were out to drag him down, that the rest of the world was corrupt (including me) and had no business telling him what way right and wrong. He'd gone out with knives before with the intention to use them, he'd go out and buy drugs which made his schizophrenia far worse, he'd try to get in to fights, he'd threaten people by telling them he knew some of the biggest gangsters in the city (he was a poker dealer so knew some coke dealers). Oh and he despised doctors and saw them as predators who only became doctors so that they could touch people (afraid to think of where that came from). \n\nI realised I didn't feel safe living with him once it got to the point that he was talking to himself about me while I was in the room with him (he was not saying nice things at all). I'd been doing things without realising for months like keeping my bedroom door locked at all times, kept a golf club next to my desk, sneaking in and out of the flat to avoid having to go for a smoke with him etc. I was just about to start the last semester of my masters degree so this had a good chance at fucking up 5 years of uni. \n\nI called his family and told them what had been happening and that he was a danger to himself and others and that he needs medical help. He went up to them, saw a family doctor once who didn't do much since my flatmate could be very good at hiding his illness from strangers for a short time. The family are very secretive and I found out that they knew about his schizophrenia for years before I even met him. Going by what my flatmate said about them, they probably don't want him to see a doctor because they have a lot of skeletons in their closet.\n\nLast I heard of him was that he ended up in a suicide ward, his family refused to tell me if he wag actually seeing a doctor before this.",

I\u2019ll be so incredibly caught in my habits and my particular way or belief that hearing others is virtually white noise sometimes. If it breaks through, it\u2019s rough. Often it will manifest into multiple other issues, they\u2019ve speculated many branching illnesses off of that, although i don\u2019t really identify with them. \n\nI\u2019m awful about sleeping, i just don\u2019t and can\u2019t. When i\u2019m alone and surrounded by \u2018myself\u2019 (speaking environmentally) i can easily stay up for days and completely lose track of time and myself. I see shit, hear shit, yet I can\u2019t sleep. Rarely does it get that back but having people bring me back down is incredibly useful. OP, that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing. \n\nMental illnesses are very unique but a common similarity is that obscurity and seclusion is the opposite of a solution. You\u2019re not obscuring her in anyway, only helping her in the most intense way possible\u2014as is necessary since she had a heart attack related to the white noise fading. \n\nIn time, she\u2019ll forgive, she will understand herself in a new way entirely. In time, you won\u2019t have the woman you previously had but a more self fluent one; it can be a beautiful thing! (paired with the proper treatment and emotionally support).\n\nedit: my anxiety isn\u2019t necessarily me being afraid of  breaking habits rather that my anxiety is so intense about social situations and many, many other things. Meaning I just have a lot of obscure habits or behaviors stemming from that, not talking at all or very little, trust issues, skewed self views. it\u2019s often debilitating. simple things are difficult. talking is virtually impossible sometimes. it\u2019s hard to explain and adjust to others who don\u2019t lack social skill as much as i do. with a social issue, it also means i struggle to articulate my issues which often causes confusion.",

It's an illness, and fortunately we live in a time where medication can often free them to live productive and happy lives, at least to a degree previously impossible.\n\nOf course everyone's different, and it's probably safe to say that OP has to prepare himself for the possibility that his life won't be the same, at least.",

He thought someone was trying to poison him so he just didn't eat or drink. He became paranoid about using the bathroom too so he just wouldn't go. \n\nHe befriended sometime though, so when he died they contacted the family to let us know of his passing, and we were able to arrange returning his body home for burial.\n\nHe suffered so much, it was a relief to know that at least he was no longer suffering.\n\nMental illness can take a heavy toll on the family and it's difficult to see someone you love going through it.

For an example: I know a very sweet woman with early stage Alzheimer's. She herself told me she has early stage, but she's still functional. She's had a few falls, recently a concussion bad enough to warrant hospitalization and monitoring, but argues and is clearly frustrated when \"she just forgot\" the reason for medical care. \n\nShe wanted to go home. It's Tuesday, she has her friends over for cards on Tuesday. For everyone else it's Friday, she's been in hospital since Sunday of last week, arguing it's Tuesday since Wednesday. She WAS a medical professional, normally she trusts doctors. She's been told numerous times and accepted it blithely every time, but I'm not sure she *can see* there's a problem when she's arguing day of the week, realizing she's mistaken, then going right back into the argument when \"she forgot\" she was already told. \n\nShe is correct, for the most part, about still being functional. So long as her routine doesn't deviate, her mental state will be a long, slow degredation over time IF the medicines she's on aren't compromised by an inability to take them properly/ and-or they stop working for her. She lives with family, and fortunately has many friends watching her like a hawk, but she is getting more childish about many things, which means it is getting worse with time. She isn't the person I originally got to know any more. There will come a time, likely in the near future, she will not accept reality even if gently corrected.",

Some of them said that sometimes they knew that they were having hallucinations, but it didn't stop it from feeling real. \n\nI relate a little. I used to have generalised anxiety disorder (still do I guess maybe?) so here's an example. I knew that my fear of washing the dishes incorrectly or breaking one - and therefore avoiding doing that chore - was totally irrational, but I continued to avoid that task as much as possible. Like I know my brain lies to me all the time, I know I'm being irrational, but it doesn't stop the thoughts or behaviour. The most recent one was I was nonstop thinking about what if I'm not allowed on this commercial flight I needed to take, what if I'm arrested because I accidentally have a bottle of moisturiser that's too big, what if the plane goes down, what if I get motion sick and vomit all over this guy next to me what if what if forever. \n\nIt sucks, and at least in my case I'm not seeing/hearing scary things and I can usually eventually talk myself out of the anxiety (or I finish the activity and nothing bad happens). Psychotic episodes must be terrifying. One of the people in that documentary described it as being in a horror movie. No wonder people behave weirdly when they're experiencing something like that.",

While I have regained certainty in my senses, there is an underlying fear that I could again fall into psychosis and fuck up my relationships and life. It isn't traumatizing after the fact that people tell me that what I've experienced isn't real. I've completely and effortlessly regained trust in everyone who was concerned. But yeah, in the thick of it, it really can be traumatic to be told by everyone closer to you that your reality isn't actual reality, if that makes sense. \n\nOP, your love and compassion for your wife touches my heart. My partner at the time acted and felt much like you, and let me tell you, once I was well I was so grateful for that compassion and commitment. \n\nI have no doubt that you will stand beside her while she gets help and stabilizes. I won't lie to you, it will most likely be a long, hard road, but you are clearly prepared to do whatever it takes and I salute you for that. I have great hope for your wife and your relationship.

She needs help.\n\nMy mom had to commit my stepdad when he was having these weird paranoia/anxiety attacks stemming from decades of undiagnosed PTSD from his time in the military. He would need to hold a loaded gun or have one very close to him to stay calm and feel safe. He would jump at the slightest unexpected noise (sometimes he was the only one who heard these noises) and patrol the yard at night, certain that something terrible was going to happen. My mom was terrified he would accidentally shoot one of us. (3 kids in the house.) He would get so angry that she could ever think he would hurt us and even more angry that she didn't hear the noises or believe we were in near constant danger. When she tried to have an intervention with his doctor, he was very angry, and irate when he had to go.\n\nMy mom wrote him letters for every day that he was gone. Telling him how much she loved him and cared about him and said she wanted him in her life, but ultimately her kids and their safety will always cone first. \n\nHe got and continued treatment and medication. He understood. She is an amazing mother who made sacrifices for her kids and would pop into mama bear mode in the blink of an eye. He loved that about her. They have been married for 26 mostly happy years now.\n\nI think OP's wife will understand too. Treatment is necessary, and it will change her life for the better.",

Schizophrenia is one of the few mental disorders that is persistent across cultures, and for most, does not remit on its own. You shouldn't count on the hope that you're going to be one of the exceptions.\n\nThere's lots of treatments available. See if you can find something else. Even therapy is useful.",

Sometimes schizophrenics in the third world do better than they do here, simply because they have community and sun. In many ways, life in the developed world has caused us a lot of stress, with many of us having to live without those basic building blocks of mental health.\n\nBut keep in mind that, in most cases, schizophrenia causes physical damage to the brain over time. That is the concern here. As you age, you will be at risk for other neurodegenerative disorders and dementia without intervention.\n\nBut as I've alluded to here, you can intervene with things other than meds. It's harder, but people do it.\n\nI would still recommend you try other meds when you are financially able. But in the mean time, see if you can find a \"voice hearers\" group to work with, or community outreach therapy of some sort. Keep your diet and your sleep schedule as clean as you can. Get enough sun. Keep your brain engaged, consistently.",

He got a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder and was treated as an inpatient for 1 month.  \n\nWhen he got out it took half a year before he was stabilized on meds and constantly took off during psychotic episodes, cheated on me, and hurt himself.  Eventually, he broke up with me.  10 years later he is stable and married, and he contacted me to let me know he was grateful for getting him committed and getting him help.\n\nI am not trying to say you will break up and I hope your marriage will survive this....I just want you to know that you are doing the right thing.  I feel your wife will know that latter when she is stabilized, and if she doesn't, please know that you are doing the right thing.",

My mom had to force me to eat and force me to go to treatment. Sometimes it was really bad and I screamed at her. One time I even held a knife in front of me telling her not to touch me because she was trying to make me eat. Eating disorders can make people crazy, but I wanted to say it gets better! The first year is really tough, but I can happily say now that I am 6 years recovered because of the hard work my mom put in and we are even closer because of the illness. Your daughter should know too that a life without the eating disorder is possible! And it\u2019s so, so worth the hard work!! If you have any questions ever feel free to message me!",

            "comment": "Have to chime in because this same thing happened to my girlfriend about 3 years ago (25M/21F).  It was a bout of schizophrenia.  It was honestly pretty easy to get her committed so I\u2019m sure you will succeed in getting her in there.  It took my girlfriend about 2 weeks to get back to normal.  It\u2019s going to be super hard to go to the psyche ward every day to visit her but you can do it; and you\u2019ll likely see her start to improve slowly but surely.  She\u2019s now my ex but we still chat every now and then and is fully recovered and is still a great girl with no psychological problems. \n\nIt\u2019s crazy to see your partner slowly go nuts (I don\u2019t have a better way to say it).  We were kind of on the fritz relationship-wise at the time and when she told me she thought she was pregnant I didn\u2019t know what to think.  Birth control tests were negative and we hadn\u2019t been having very much sex at all before that, but she insisted she was pregnant.  I thought she might be trying to screw with me to make sure I didn\u2019t break up with her as she had been talking about wanting to get married and start a family soon.  I tried everything I could to convince her she wasn\u2019t pregnant (wrong move) eventually a light clicked that she was delusional and she needed to go to the hospital.  I had to talk tell her parents what was going on and we told her we were going to the hospital to check on the baby.  She was involuntarily committed after as soon as a spot opened up in the ward which took a couple days.  We were told to play along with the pregnancy until the doctors advised otherwise.  Once she was in there, we could visit every day but didn\u2019t see any improvement for a while, but eventually she started to connect with reality slowly but surely.\n\nIf you are like me you will have to come up with a lie about why she is AWOL from her obligations ASAP because I don\u2019t think she will like it known that she had to spend time in a mental institution.  Some people are open about mental disorders, especially on the internet.  But when your wife finally comes to the realization that she had a psychotic episode she will be very, very embarrassed.  Fortunately, my boss knew her because she previously worked at the same place and took great care to make sure I was free during visiting hours without anyone else at my workplace finding out (they knew her also).  OTOH, my girlfriend had a ball in the psyche ward playing games and wii-fit all day, finger-painting, etc. It was like a vacation for her while she was in there.  She also claimed it was twins and came up for names with them (one named after me and one named after my dog lol) and planned our wedding.  I still have all the arts and crafts she made and letters she wrote me.  She doesn\u2019t remember any of that period of her commitment.  But it was really hard for me to see her there with all the folks with even worse problems, wondering to myself if she would devolve into something like them.  I\u2019d feel sick to my stomach in there.\n\nI feel for you man.  I had only been dating the girl for about a year and I can only imagine what it must be like to have that happen to a spouse.  But, iirc the fact that she is older means it is even less likely to become a long-term issue because schizophrenia almost always first presents in the teens and twenties.\n\nGood luck to you, but I\u2019m pretty confident that this episode will be solidly in the rear-view by months-end.",

My mental health in general has been erratic for the last few years, but I'm almost convinced that it's a natural hormonal thing that women my age experience.  \n\nAll that to say, you are doing right by her whether it feels like it or not.  I have no idea how my husband would handle a mental breakdown of any kind.  I only hope he could confront it with the logic and sensibility that you have.

I can only hope that he will recognize a real problem and get me the mental health care I needed before I walked right off the ledge.  \n\nI'm glad reddit has been a helpful outlet for you and has actually shown some compassion and given  you good feedback &amp; advice.  But, I'll encourage you to reach out to someone, anyone that you can lean on right now.

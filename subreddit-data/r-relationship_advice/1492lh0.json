    "postText": "Title says it all. I am a 28F with a boyfriend 30M. We\u2019ve been together for over 4 years and live together currently. At the 2 year mark, I brought up the discussion of taking a break/having a temporary open relationship. Essentially, the 2 year mark was the point (for me) where either things were going to get really serious or we should break things off if it wasn\u2019t. I felt if he had the urge to test the field/tick things off the check list, purely for physical reasons, then that was his chance. He said he didn\u2019t feel the need to at all.\n\nI thought it up after the 4 year mark as well; this was after discussions on engagement rings, engagement, marriage, purchasing a house together. I said yet again, this is the last chance on either breaking things off, or moving forward with our future. If there\u2019s any urge to be physical with anyone other than me, now is the time. He took me up on my offer this time. We decided in a few parameters; it\u2019s purely physical, a one year time frame unless otherwise decided by either of us, and I would roughly vet the girls (essentially if I knew them or not, as despite living in a very big city, because I grew up here - it becomes a very small city). He offered that it\u2019d only be fair if I also had the same parameters and options. I said I didn\u2019t feel the need to, but understood how we should both have the opportunity to. \n\nEdited: for clarity, it\u2019s currently open on both sides of the relationship. \n\nThoughts, things to consider, will this blow up in my face or his? \n\nFor some context:\n\n-\tHe has had very few sexual partners. I\u2019m his second. He\u2019s had one situationship prior to me. \n-\tI\u2019ve had 5-10 sexual partners, and 3 serious long term (two that involved long distance) relationships ranging in length from 1-6 years. I\u2019ve been only single roughy 4-6 months of the last 13 years, however had a few months of serial dating before this relationship.\n-\tI\u2019ve had several relationships in the past, all in fact, that have ended because my partner cheated on me. All with females that they didn\u2019t end up being in a relationship with.\n-\tI grew up with extremely conservative views (sex after marriage, no porn, date for marriage etc) and still strongly believe in monogamy. Tbh I feel like my younger self would be extremely shocked at where I am relationship situation wise today. I still believe in monogamy and want my happily ever after. \n-\tFrom my perspective, he holds a lot of resentment for things; things that he never got to try or do, or even have the opportunity to decide to do, because of parental limitations and family financial limitations etc. and still speaks of these situations with bitterness and resentment. I mentioned this, and said I personally feel like he would resent me if I didn\u2019t give him this opportunity before we committed our lives to each other. When we were just friends before we dated, he often spoke about how he wished he made better use of his university time and dated around.",

Intending to go ahead with this, setting firm boundaries is as much as you can do to protect what you have with him, but best intentions aren't always enough. Even making rules to keep it only physical, feelings can still develop. That's him. You? As this was your idea, and you've pushed it, one assumes you think you'll be okay with the situation. Only time will tell whether that remains the case.",

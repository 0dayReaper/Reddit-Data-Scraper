    "postText": "Last year I (female) landed my dream job. The only problem is that I think I fell in love with my boss the moment I laid eyes on him. My boss (let\u2019s call him Mark) is handsome, smart, funny, and  basically the whole package. When I met Mark for orientation I noticed he made intense eye contact with me exclusively. Recently I have noticed him coming around me more and maybe also staring at me when he thinks I am not looking.\nThe problem is I have a boyfriend and Mark is married. I have immense respect for all couples and would never cheat or be a home wrecker. But for some reason I cannot stop daydreaming about Mark.\nI have been dating my SO for years and genuinely love him. But I forget about him when I am with my boss. \nHow can I get over Mark while still working closely with him? \n\nSome background info, my boss and I are both passionate about our jobs compared to my SO who doesn\u2019t understand or care about it).",

If you are \u201cin love\u201d with your boss, you can\u2019t be in love with your boyfriend. \n\nYou know it would be inappropriate for your boss to have a relationship with you because you are is subordinate and because he\u2019s married.  So it\u2019s best that you do what you need to keep this relationship professional.  If you can\u2019t, it might be better if you get a new job.",

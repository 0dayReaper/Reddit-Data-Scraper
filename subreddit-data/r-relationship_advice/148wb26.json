    "postText": "I live in Edmonton Alberta and my ex boyfriend Travis lives in Kelowna BC more specifically Rutland BC. We dated 3 years ago when i was 18 years old, he's 2 years older than me assistant manager at his job but he still lives at home and helps his family with bills and whatever. When we were together over the summer i spent a month in Kelowna with Travis and his family. Even after spending a month with him things were rough he was thinking i was messing around with my ASEXUAL VIRGIN best friend and he was very protective when it came to other guys i'll say. Eventually i planned to move out to Kelowna get a place of my own to be closer to him and work on our relationship. Well his mom didn't like that and started yelling at him about it and it got too much with his mom basically being in the middle of our relationship messaging me when me and Travis had a fight etc. I ended it with him when i did that his mom went off saying i told Travis not to date someone close i knew this was gonna happen etc and we didn't talk for 3 years after the break up. Fast forward we reconnected in April of this year he tells me about his ex girlfriend Sam who lived with him for a couple months then randomly while he was at work packed her things and left. At the start when i messaged him he was dry wanted nothing to do with me then we kinda just got to talking. he asked for my onlyfans and admitted to trying to find it before i even told him what it was, he kept all the stuff i gave him when we were together, he sent me a selfie on snap of him cuddling the stuffy i gave him. One thing leads to another we agree to be fwb, we have been talking almost every day talking about me moving in with him when he gets his own place and be a live in whore he calls me hun and all that. then all of a sudden three nights ago he tells me how he went on a date and it went well they went to the park got ice cream but he wasn't sure of her either cause she has a kid (he never wants kids). then a day after that he messages me all upset because this girl he had a date with cancelled on him because they had a disagreement he was calling her hun in their texts n everything when he sent me screenshots. i was all weird about it n kinda ignored it, last night i apologized to him for getting all weird about this girl and he was like \"i mean you take dick i let it slide\ud83d\ude02\" then i went \"Imao i mean i don't think you really care if i fuck people\" and THEN he says \"I get jealous over guys, I've told you that before\" so i asked him this \"if things could be different would you want them to be?\" \nhe replied with \"There would have to be a lot of things that were different for it to happen, my mom will never forgive you because she says you cheated so we can't really fix that, but in a perfect world if things were different I think I would be happy.\"\nSo of course i got all cheesy \"in all seriousness i want you to be happy even if it's not with me and some part of me is always going to love you/have love for you\" \nThen he went \"I'll always keep you around, and things could change, who knows\". \n----------------\nAll of this yet he is still seeing/wanting this other woman, in their texts he said she is everything he wants in a partner. It hurts but like what does this even mean i'm just confused i guess",

He is actively looking for someone else.\n\nMy Advice to you:  Wish him well, then go no contact and move on with your life.    \n\n\nSomewhere there is a partner for you who will put you as number 1 but you will not find that partner if you remain entangled with your ex.  You deserve to be the prize in the cereal box for someone, not the cereal that comes out when there is nothing else in the cupboard.",

He won\u2019t stand up to his mom, he rings you up to get your porn acc, he talks to you about other girls he\u2019s dating - and he can be jealous and you can\u2019t be??? (To be clear, his \u201cjealousy behavior\u201d when yall were dating sounds more controlling/paranoid to me. Not cute.)\n\nDon\u2019t waste your time with a mama\u2019s boy that only sees you as an option B and sex doll.\n\nFind someone that actually appreciates you.",

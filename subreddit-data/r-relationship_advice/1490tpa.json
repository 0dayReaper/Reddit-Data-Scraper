    "postText": "Hi everyone,\r  \n\r  \nI (24M) broke up with my ex (24F) last month but we tried reconciling and working things out over that period of time. I came to find out that during that period of reconciliation, that she was also calling and texting her ex, which I found out last week.\r  \n\r  \nI know how she has the right to do as she pleases since we're broken up but I've never felt so betrayed in my life before.\r  \n\r  \nI'll try to keep this post short. Our 3 year relationship has always been very volatile given that she's a very negative person while I might have anger management issues (for which I've been seeing a counsellor for).\r  \n\r  \nWhen we got into our relationship, she had just broken up with her ex and when we did start dating her ex was always trying to contact her. At times when we argued or 'broke up' she will use this chance to contact her ex/ give him the opportunity to interact. Her justification is always that she is just 'sorting' things out with her suicidal ex as she doesn't want him to keep 'waiting' for her.\r  \n\r  \nComing back to today, excluding the few instances that she owned up to me for contacting her ex and what I found out last week, I've also found out that there was even a time that she met up with her ex in person and he kissed her. I have proof of all of this.\r  \n\r  \nGetting back to why I feel so betrayed, before we started dating, I've asked her countless times if she was ready for a relationship, if her is is over her ex and which adamantly said at those times that she was.\r  \n\r  \nAfter all the heartache I've gone through to make her see how it was wrong, after the many times she manipulated me into thinking that she was truly 'sorting' things out with her ex, after the times she has used our fights as reasoning for our failing relationship, it's currently really hard for me to live past this.\r  \n\r  \nYesterday I also did something unthinkably bad. I got a hold of her Instagram account and posted on her profile the screenshots of her contacting her ex during our breakup, begging him to meet-up and possibly get back together. I was felt terribly disrespected and angry at that time, but my friend got me to take down the post shortly after, which I did.\r  \n\r  \nI have since deleted her Instagram account and every second of my life feels miserable right now. Incompatible partners really leads to a toxic relationship, which leads you to wasting years of your life away and much needed therapy afterwards.\r  \n\r  \nTLDR; Feeling really lost and empty now after what seems to be a complex case of emotional cheating between both my ex and her ex.",

I really need to try my best adjusting to single life.\n\nI feel it won't be easy as I'm not working in my hometown, my dad passed away couple years ago, I'm close to my sister or mum but don't usually share my personal life with them and my friends lives can get quite occupied at times.\n\nI've been cooking and I'm going to workout with a friend later but everything just feels so different. I used to live and share every part of my life with my ex but now I have nothing.\n\nI know I wasn't the best boyfriend, but how can anyone do this? I'm so mentally dead right now. \n\nDuring the relationship, all my actions were always taken the negatively, even when I had no bad intentions. I really don't even know what to think right now. My mindset is royally messed up from this relationship.",

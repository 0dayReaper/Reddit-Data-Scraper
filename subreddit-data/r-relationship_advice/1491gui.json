    "postText": "i (f27) play a lot of online games and play a lot with my online friends. im meeting an online friend of 3 years in the weekend since shes going to be visiting the city for a day to see her aunt. my mother would ask where im going and she DOES NOT believe in online friends. she told me everytime we eat together that theyre catfishes who want to kidnap me or take my organs or anything with bad intentions. i know for a fact that the online friend im meeting isnt like that. so, incase my mom asks, i need an alibi. so, i ask my partner (f28) if she could cover for me and say im with her. she said no. i said ok. so i asked another friend to cover for me.\n\nthen, when i told her that, she said im replacing her with said friend. i told her im just respecting her wishes. then she said she can change her mind and to ask her again. i already got my friends approval so i said i didnt need it anymore.  she then started saying how im replacing her with my friend and how much shes easy to replace. im not replacing her, i dont even talk to my friend that much, she said me or friend i said her ofc, and she doesnt believe me. i said ok fine she ll be my alibi again so theres nothing to fight about. boom. the next paragraph will be written by her.\n\ni am partner and will be explaining my side. i actually have depression so it pains me to think that i can be easily replaced. she can go with whoever she wants bec she has a big list of friends while i only have less than five and those friends of mine in question are either married to each other or not bestie level friendship with me so they would not have my side at all times. my partner is all i have but she doesnt care abt that so it hurts me. she wouldnt understand that shes all i have left and she can just pick someone else than me i am hurt HURT\n\nhello back to me, to clarify, she has another bestie, her bestie is just married but i also get jealous of them cus they always go out together but i dont say anything because theyre just friends. im not replacing her im just respecting her saying no.\n\nback to partner,, my partner never tells me anything (u can go back to our previous post abt how she doesnt tell me anything when im always open ears to any of her feelings and concerns) and that includes everyone she knows too and that shes jealous of my married bestie AND my partner is literally besties with my bestie n her husband too so it doesnt make sense for her to get jealous of them \n\nits me, what do you guys think? what is your advice for our relationship to improve?\n\ntldr: my mom doesnt believe in online friends, im meeting one, told my partner to cover for me, she said no, i said ok so i asked another person\n\ntldr 2: (partner pov) my partner doesnt understand me and my neediness of affection and attention but she still chose to pick another person over me",

It\u2019s not fair to expect our significant other to be everything to us.  That\u2019s a huge burden and that that can be crushing. I also think that the partner would benefit from individual counseling.",

I really cannot understand how asking a friend to cover for you would lead to one being replaced. I think that's pretty unfair to think.\n\nI'd venture as far to say as it's manipulative and unreasonable. Mental health isn't a pass to treat your partner poorly.",

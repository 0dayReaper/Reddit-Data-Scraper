    "postText": "Note: English isn't my native language so I used ChatGPT's help. If there's something unclear, I can clarify it for you.\n\nMe and my ex-girlfriend have known each other for 8 months, and we were going out for a few months. About 6 months ago, she introduced me to one of her friends who happened to be in the same class as me. Later we chatted a bit in class and on WhatsApp, just talking about stuff we had in common (we didn't text much on WhatsApp though, mostly talked when we ran into each other in class or grabbing lunch after class). A few days later she was acting weird to my ex, messaging my ex about our conversations and mentioning me to her. My ex warned me about her, saying I should watch out for her intentions. But since her friend didn't show me any signs of interest and we kept it friendly, I kept talking to her the same way. Weeks later during a convo I found out that my ex was jealous of her. My ex didn't look at things from my perspective at all. She only cared about her friend's intentions. I stopped texting her friend then and there.\n\nFast forward a few months, me and my girlfriend were going through a rough patch, we sat and we wanted to talk about our relationship. She said that she didn't wanna be in a relationship right now. After a day, even though I hadn't talked to her friend for a long time, I was curious how she was doing, so I texted her, \"I stopped talking to you because I felt things were getting too close between us, and I wanna know how you saw me back then before we start talking so we can maintain the distance.\" (I wrote it like that becuase of my ex's warning about the friend). I asked her why she wasn't showing up at school and how she was but we didn't chat much besides that.\n\nThen, a week later, she tells me she broke up with her boyfriend and she's feeling really down. I felt bad for the girl and wanted to meet up with her. By the way, I'm sure any of my messages were things she could misinterpret. And few hours later I get a text from my ex about how her friend showed our conversation to her. She was heartbroken, she felt like I cheated on her. During the week that we were separate, I was telling my ex how much I loved her, but at the same time, I was asking my her friend why she wasn't coming to school. When I first messaged the girl, I didn't have any ulterior motives, or at least I didn't think so. And even if I did, I was texting to her thinking me and my girlfriend were on an indefinite.\n\nNow, she's telling me she warned me before and she'll never forgive me for what I did. I admitted I messed up, but I didn't think her friend saw me in a different way. I told and showed her my messages to her friend weren't flirty at all, and I blocked her and won't text her again. Can I regain her trust?",

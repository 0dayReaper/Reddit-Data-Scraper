    "postText": "\nDon\u2019t remember exactly why I accepted his friend\u2019s friend request. I am guessing it was because I saw there were mutual friends or I mistaken him as someone I know, I added this guy who is a friend of my BF. As this \u201cfriend\u201d is a loan officer, I am guessing he is adding people on FB to get potential clients. And he has wife and kids, I am sure he has no other intention. But my Bf said it is the principle that you should not add friends wife or GF on social media. And it is me that disrespectful to add a friend of his, since I don\u2019t even know this person.\nThere was zero interaction between this person and me. But now my BF is calling me pofs and I have no boundaries and no respect. He will show me no respect so I know how it feels.\nI don\u2019t think he should control how I manage my social media? How can I communicate to him that this is just normal social media thing?",

    "postText": "I (24F) found out a few months ago that my instagram account has been logged in with another device and I found out that my boyfriend (24M) has been accessing my instagram account without my consent and looking through my DMs, search history and the stories/posts of people that I'm following. \n\nI confronted him about it and he admitted it saying he felt insecure. However he also refuses to tell me how he got hold of my account and I suspect he is using third party apps to access it. For the next few months, I just closed one eye and let him continue hacking/stalking my instagram account as I thought that would make him feel more secure. But now, I'm starting to feel uneasy as I realized that he doesn't just check on my account occasionally but he checks on my account almost on a daily basis. In fact, he gets a notification everytime someone sends me a DM. I know this because I realized his phone buzzes every time someone sends me a DM on instagram.\n\nI don't know what to feel about it except that it's becoming to feel abit too possessive. So although he hacks and goes through my social media account, he is rather secretive of his own phone. If I talk about this to him, he shuts me down by saying that this makes him feel secure and its his own way of dealing with his own securities. I'm not sure what to feel about this.",

You need to either talk it out with him and find the reasons for his insecurities(but it seems like he doesn\u2019t want to address them) or tell him it\u2019s making you feel uncomfortable and violated knowing he can see everything you do. If he still can\u2019t wrap his head around your feelings without putting his first, it may be time to rethink your relationship OP.",

            "comment": "This sounds more like paranoia than just insecurity. \n\nThe problem is that spying tends to reinforce the behavior rather than reduce it. He\u2019s not going to think \u201cit\u2019s been 6 months I can trust her now\u201d he\u2019s going to think \u201cI just haven\u2019t caught her yet.\u201d This escalates especially when you try to regain some privacy/autonomy back. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t recommend staying with him. I would break up and delete all my socials for a long while. \n\nHowever, if you want to give it one last shot, tell him he\u2019s had long enough and that if he doesn\u2019t trust you now he never will, that you\u2019re also insecure about what\u2019s on his phone and demand he shows you exactly how he spies on you. Then, make the relationship contingent on him going to therapy and that he has to show you his phone every time you ask. He will probably refuse all of this and accuse you of trying to hide something.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, thanks for all your responses on my [previous post. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d0fmrl/my_grandparents_dont_approve_of_my_relationship/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nIt was all really good advice, but the very best out of it all was the suggestion that I come clean to Sam. I did that, and he reacted in a surprisingly calm manner. I asked him how he\u2019s taking it so well and he told me he\u2019s experienced something similar before. \n\nHis cousin had come out as gay a few years back, and he told me how his own grandparents reacted very poorly to his cousins revelation. He told me they absolutely refused to acknowledge the fact that he was gay and said some pretty hurtful stuff along the lines of how his homosexuality would embarrass them in front of all their family and friends etc. They wouldn\u2019t allow the cousin to bring his boyfriend to family gatherings, and threatened to cut him out out of their inheritance unless he \u201cgot his head straight\u201d. \n\nHe then showed me pictures of his grandparents laughing along with his cousins husband, pictures of them at his cousins wedding etc. He told me they eventually grew out of it and as they go to know him they really bonded with the guy. \n\nSam joked that he wouldn\u2019t give my grandparents a choice and that within a month they\u2019d be in love with him. \n\nWell I think it\u2019s working. Sam and I have dinner at my grandparents house every night, and each night I notice them more and more at ease and more avidly taking part in our conversations. Sam and my grandpa are both WW2 enthusiasts, and my grandpa absolutely loves having discussions on the subject with Sam. \n\nI decided to update this post because last night something very special happened. I got there before Sam, and I could _see the disappointment on their faces when they thought I had come alone_. They asked where Sam was, when he was coming etc. Then they said we wouldn\u2019t start eating until he arrived. \n\nI\u2019m just so incredibly happy that I get to keep both relationships.",

Racism can stem from emotions such as fear, loneliness, feelings of inadequacy and blind hatred. Young people headed down that path aren't just going to \"realize\" that it's stupid, unfortunately, educated or not. \n\nThe best way to contradict or disprove people's views that are based in emotion is to provide an experience that contradicts their world view, like OP did. I for one think that in a lot of ways it is the responsibility of those of us who see this as a great wrong in society to do something about it where and when it is safe for us to do so. Otherwise we are just all talk and no substance.\n\nAre we not responsible for creating the society and the future that we want to inhabit? Maybe this persons grandparents are still plenty racially biased, but it also takes time to undo decades of programmed responses and racism. If anything, they're open to experiencing something that contradicts their views on race, which puts them on the right path.\n\nWaiting for old people to die and the young to snap out of it is just passing the buck, it's lazy. Dismantling systemic racism takes the involvment of all of us, and too many are content to sit on their hands and wait for the government to help us or for the people they dislike to finally die. If you had some empathy, you'd be much more willing to see that this person's grandparents are trying and that's a good thing. Instead you just have to point out that they're probably still racist so who cares we just need to wait for them to die, of course they probably didn't just snap out of it. These things take time, life isn't a movie where everyone is capable of having life-changing epiphanies within a 24-hour time period.\n\nPeople in here demonizing the grandparents can't seem to understand what genuine progress is, this is what breaking these barriers is like in reality, it's uncomfortable and it takes time. You have to put up with that for the sake of trying to reach out and make change.",

But the idea that this is how 'racism is solved', or even worse that it is somehow the minority's responsibility to bridge the gap is fucking disgusting.\n\nPersonally had I chose to marry a black woman and any of my white relatives reacted negatively they'd be cut the fuck out of my life until they apologized and changed appropriately.

My grandparents raised me because of my mom's mental health issues. She was schizophrenic and bipolar, and I think part of her schizophrenia made her into a Rachel Dolezal type before Rachel Dolezal was a thing. She basically lived her life as a black woman including dating black men. My grandma was uncomfortable with it after there was a pattern established (she once said to me \"I don't care if she wants to date a black man, but does it have to be *only* black men?\"). Grandpa would never let her boyfriends in the house. If she came to visit and they drove her (she didn't have a license) they'd have to wait in the car outside. \n\nIt was always hard for me to reconcile this with the image I had of my grandparents because they're wonderful loving, accepting people. They both have friends of all ethnicities, I've never heard them talk about POC with slurs or disparaging remarks. They're not *racist* in the ways you'd think, but they had this hang-up about biracial couples. \n\nIt wasn't until my mom's funeral, where her (black) boyfriend of 12 years went up to say a few words but could only sob uncontrollably, that I think it clicked for them. He got a hug from them both afterwards. \n\nUnfortunately, some people only learn lessons the hard way.",

It just sucks to have to put that much effort to get people to see you as a human being.\n\nOf course, it's a dynamic that can happen in many different ways.

It really, really sucks, but it's just the way it is.\n\nI had the same thing happen to me. My fianc\u00e9s parents were racist and xenophobic, and when they found out about my nationality and race they went insane. Called me wetback, didn't let me into their house, etc. I toughed it out and tried to get them to come around like your bf did but that ended up not happening at all. It came down to me making the decision to start respecting and loving myself and also to not make my fianc\u00e9 even consider choosing between them or me because I lost my family when I came here (they stayed behind) and I wasn't going to put her through the same. I left her. Shortly after she started dating this white guy, who they actually liked and let in their house, etc... it was just easier for her to date that type of person, so I understood and let if be even though it really hurt because this guy was a good friend of mine, or so I thought. I haven't dated anyone since because I can't shake the fear of having that happen again. I developed social anxiety since then.\n\nI am glad it did work out for all of you, I really am.

    "postText": "LONG post i\u2019m sorry. he cheated/has been cheating and i found out today because the girls dad (and her) came to my house saying he owed her money. they said a lot of things and she showed me some proof just about them being together , not about everything. he did admit it but basically said that it was all an act, because he was being blackmailed by her and basically her whole family but based off what i saw, it was a really committed act. i believe some of what she said but the other things that she said that she has no proof of, is just messing with my head even though there\u2019s no proof. i don\u2019t want to break up, i want us to work through it but it\u2019s going to take a long time and i have conditions that he said he\u2019s willing to cooperate with. i don\u2019t know why im not feeling as sick as i should even after SEEING proof of them doing things. i am really just feeling sad and hurt. there were times when i was catching on and he made up a BS lie and even though i knew it was BS, i just moved on. \n\nwhat they\u2019re blackmailing him with is big enough which was his motivating factor and he went to file a restraining order against them so i do believe that. i just really don\u2019t know how to get through the whole \u201ci can\u2019t even really look at you right now because i\u2019m just getting flashes of those pictures and videos with her\u201d in order to work through this and build that trust again. \n\ni would always say that if someone cheated on me, i would leave them. but he\u2019s my first boyfriend and my feelings are strong, i know this alone should prove that his feelings aren\u2019t the same but i still believe that he does love me like he says.\n\ni know the easiest thing would be to leave but i just really want to work through it. even now, all i want to do is lay with him and forget everything that i found out today. maybe i\u2019m really dumb for that and maybe he\u2019ll do it again but that\u2019s something i need to find out on my own and as for now, i still love him just as much so i do want to figure things out. does anyone who\u2019s gotten cheated on and stayed with the person have any advice on how to build a strong relationship after something like this?",

Do you really want to be involved with something like this? If he\u2019s meant for you take a break let him work through that. And see what happens. don\u2019t be so quick to take someone back after they do that to you. There are consequences, so be friends for a little bit to see where he goes mentally. Work on yourself for a little bit and see how he handles getting out of this predicament because you might not wanna be involved. I know it sounds cool to be a ride or die chick, but it is not what it\u2019s cracked up to be.",

            "comment": "I know that some people might say it, but you're very young to be this dealing with stuff like this. I understand that the cheating may or may not have happened, but the fact that you have to deal with a situation like this in the first place is a red flag in itself. I'm not sure how long you've been dating, but cheating allegations are not something that many partners are able to get over easily. On top of that, it takes a major lack of empathy and love to cheat on a partner, so if he really did cheat, it's difficult to say that you have a relationship that is very strong to build something on. The person you date or even marry should be someone who makes your life easier, not someone who adds extra stress into your life, especially at your age. Only you can know if you can get truly get over allegations like this and love him for who he is. If not, then I highly suggest you cut ties sooner rather than later.",

If you want it to work (BOTH of you) then it's certainly possible to create a good relationship. I guess my stance is that it's tough to trust someone completely when you've dealt with these kinds of situations. It kinda makes it harder to forgive and forget, which I think is something you need to be able to do to make a relationship work. As much as it hurts to say, try not to have high expectations or else it might hurt worse later on.",

    "postText": "My friend and I have known each other for 12 years and are closer than ever. I\u2019ll call her AJ. We\u2019re each others ride or die, always having each other back no matter what. When we first met I didn\u2019t expect anything out of our relationship since she was upfront about her sexuality. She liked women and I respected that. We\u2019ve done everything together whether it was going out to events or working the same jobs/having the same hours. Inseparable since we were 14.\n\nSo around when we were 18/19 something changed. I was single at the time and AJ was with her gf at the time. It was summer and puberty finally kicked my ass and I started looking like a  man. Anyway, there was this one hot day when AJ, her gf and I were just hanging out. We were roaming the streets, having fun and I was feeling myself so I was being jokingly flirty with her like we usually do (More like playful teasing). When the day was over she texted me \u201cYou looked really good today\u201d or something along those lines and I returned the compliment not really thinking anything of it because, why would I? As the months would go by the flirting would go on and in person we were somewhat awkward around each other. I even told her how cute she looked with her hair down etc.\n\nShe invites me over one day to hang out and when I get there she opens the door and gives me the tightest hug up to the point where there\u2019s no space between us. And wouldn\u2019t you know it\u2026 her hairs down. When I complimented her she gave me a smile and we went into her room. I sat on the bed, controller in hand ready to play whatever game we planned on getting into that day and she just sat near me and started smiling. The tension in the room was so powerful for some reason and I didn\u2019t know why. When I looked at her it was like I was seeing her for the first time. Then\u2026 she leaned in, eyes closing and lips puckered. My heart was beating out of my chest and the only think I could do was mimic her action. As we got closer my heart was pounding like crazy until our lips met. It was like this shock of electricity. A soft peck turned into a full on make out session until her mom knocked on the door and we stopped. After that we just played the game and that was the end of it\u2026 or so I thought.\n\nMore time passed but the whole time I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about that kiss because I had never thought about her in that way until that day. Don\u2019t get me wrong, she is beautiful and such a nice person but these feelings I had were hitting me like a truck. We were still hanging out but every once in a while she\u2019d gaze over and me, smile and I\u2019d do the same.\n\nIt got really spicy when I was going for a walk to clear my head and she just so happened to see me as she was going home so she invited me inside. Her sister was in her room so AJ wanted to go hang out in the basement. We played some games, talked about random stuff like usual and then boom. Next think I know we\u2019re full blown making out and she\u2019s asking me if I have a condom. We attempted to have intercourse right there and then but we heard someone coming and quickly stopped.\n\nSince then there was been many incidents like that but never gotten to the point of having sex. After a while we just stopped. Not because we didn\u2019t want to but because we would respect when either other of us had a gf. She\u2019s even told me she she finds me extremely attractive and vise versa.\n\nThings have cooled off since then and we\u2019re both in our own separate relationships. I had time to think and assumed that maybe we just had a sexual attraction to one another but every once in a while she\u2019ll lay on my lap, we\u2019d cuddle or she would get real girly around me and I\u2019d get nervous around her all over again. Still close as ever too and the best of friends but every once in a while she\u2019ll bring up the stuff we did and we\u2019d talk about it or either of us would text the other that we had a dream about us being together. She even said that whenever we are single, we end up together. We\u2019ll even text each other whenever we\u2019re thinking of one another.\nI even spoke to my father about this and he said \u201cIf you love her then go for it, and don\u2019t have any regrets in your life. If this is what you want in your heart then try it out\u201d but idk.\n\nThis was more of me venting and getting this all out but if anyone has thoughts on this, feel free to comment.",

You're both emotionally cheating on your relationships. \n\nIf you wanna be friends with her and have your relationships, you need iron clad boundaries. If you wanna shoot your shot, but stop bringing other people into this mess.",

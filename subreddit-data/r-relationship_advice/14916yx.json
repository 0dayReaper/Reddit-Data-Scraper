    "postText": "I\u2019m working long hours to earn money so I can buy a decent ring in a couple months time, but this means I\u2019m spending less time with my girlfriend so it\u2019s counter intuitive to our relationship and valuable time together - especially because I can\u2019t tell her the reason for why I\u2019m working so much overtime. I have no excuses to tell her that is enough or more important than us having more time together instead of me working overtime. Any suggestions? I save as best I can but my regular wage isn\u2019t enough to cover things at the moment on top of saving for the ring.",

    "postText": "This is my first time posting here, so I apologize if my writing isn\u2019t that great.\n\nAs the title says, i\u2019m in love with my best friend. She also equally reciprocates, and knows how I feel, so there\u2019s no need for an awkward confession. \n\nHowever, I don\u2019t know how to proceed. We both love each other a lot. She\u2019s been there for me for a long time now, and I don\u2019t want to fuck it all up. I keep fantasizing about dating and being her partner, but I feel like i\u2019m in over my head about all this.\n\nWe\u2019ve discussed dating, and we\u2019ve decided to hold off on proceeding due to our stressful and busy lives. We\u2019re scared of going to that point because dating usually leads to breakups, and we don\u2019t want to lose each other.\n\nShe feels like \u201cthe one\u201d for me. not like a silly teen crush, but like\u2026 she\u2019s *really* meant for me. I could talk about how great she is all day\u2026 but I want to keep this short and ask, how should I proceed. should I just say \u201cfuck it\u201d and date or continue our friendship with romantic feelings?",

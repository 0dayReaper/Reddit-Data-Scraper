    "postText": "My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 1/2 years. I haven\u2019t seen him in almost a month because of college and we started getting frisky once my parents went to sleep (or so I thought). My dad ended up coming downstairs and seeing us, telling my boyfriend to leave and never return. I\u2019m still financially dependent on my parents and am unsure of what to do. Prior to this my dad\u2019s relationship with my boyfriend was fine but I worry it\u2019s completely ruined. Any advice on what I could say or do to help remedy this situation?",

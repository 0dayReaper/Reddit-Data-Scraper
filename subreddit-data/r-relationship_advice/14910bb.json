    "postText": "So i\u2019m in a relationship for 6-7 months now.\n\nLittle backstory, she has been in a relationship with her ex for 13 years and has 2 kids with him.\n\nWe took the time to get to know each other before we got into a relationship, but ever since we did, she\u2019s showing really radical behaviour when in a discussion.\n\nThis usually occurs when she\u2019s in a bad mood.. She can be really sweet, but it almost seems like she completely changes personality when she\u2019s stressed.\n\nExamples: - When i try to help her in the house (painting, laundry,..) and something is not done the way she\u2019s used to she says \u2018leave it, i\u2019ll do it myself! You\u2019re causing me more work then less!\u2019\n- I was installing the airconditioning upstairs but when it didn\u2019t work out immediately she says \u2018leave it, I will ask my dad to do it!\u2019 \n\nI always end up being really frustrated cause when i reply that she should trust me and let me help, she says i have to leave it alone. \n\nI\u2019m a kind person, always helpful. But I get the feeling I don\u2019t get appreciated by her.\nWe actually almost broke up about it. \n\nIf we talk she says it\u2019s me who is weak and I should leave her alone when she is in a bad mood. \n\nThat is obviously not working out because I always end up frustrated and it\u2019s eating me away.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with woman like this?\n\nCause i\u2019m feeling a bit lost here..",

            "comment": "Communication is very poor in a relationship as well as vulnerability. You should be able to expressed to her the issue that you\u2019re having and she should be able to sit there and listen and work with you to figure out how you guys can be better. This is what a normal healthy relationship is about and these are what normal healthy people do. Now what unhealthy people do is what she\u2019s doing. So she needs to go and get some counseling for herself. You should be able to express yourself and she\u2019s not giving you a good and safe place to be able to do so. I would bring it to her attention one more time and let her know the consequences of what will happen if this doesn\u2019t get better. At that time you need to prepare yourself for executing sad consequences. Or you\u2019re gonna be stuck in this heck for a very long time. People have to be open to change the want to change so either you\u2019re going to exert a lot of energy getting her to change her you\u2019re going to take your chances out in the wild.",

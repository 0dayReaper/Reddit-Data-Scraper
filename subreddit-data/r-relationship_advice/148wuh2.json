    "postText": "So my boyfriend and I have been dating for about 5 months and I had met him when he had buzzed his hair. He let it grow throughly the duration of our relationship and buzzed it again. So he had longer hair for about 3 months of our relationship.\n\n Now he usually sends me pictures from his life before me and this was one such case, he sent me a picture and I had assumed it was before our relationship and commented as such. I forgot for that minute that he had longer hair\nAnd this obviously hurt him. However he said I destroyed his self esteem and made him feel like he wasn't a man. I kept apologising throughout this entire time.\nLater when I thought everything was okay and I went to sleep, he called me again and kept sending me pictures to prove that he had longer way and as a reminder. He had longer hair when I first told him I loved him and he thought I didn't love him or he doesn't mean anything to me since I forgot.  \n\nWe had a lot of memories during this stage and he took it as it didn't mean anything to me. He then kept telling me how I destroyed him. \nHow do I make it up to him and let him know it was just a mistake?",

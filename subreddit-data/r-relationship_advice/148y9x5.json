    "postText": "My husband and I have been together for about two and half years, married for ten months, and have a baby on the way. I\u2019ll start off by admitting that I have always been pretty insecure, just generally in life, but I tend to get even more so when it comes to our relationship. Before we met, he had gotten out of a four year, on and off relationship (she was abusive). I had never been in a relationship before so I was constantly worried about being compared and all that. Two months into us dating she tried to contact him while we were on a road trip together, but he\u2019s never wanted anything to do with her since they split. However, my anxiety-ridden brain likes to make me randomly think about that day and picturing them together and then I start worrying and yadda yadda. I\u2019ve told him about this numerous times and he\u2019s always very reassuring and tries to make me feel better. \n\nFlash forward, we recently got back from a two week trip and I was working on a slideshow for it. We both took photos on our phones and have a shared album, but he also took his camera and I was checking to see if he\u2019d uploaded any pictures from it onto the computer. While searching, I found a folder with pictures and videos from his trip to Mexico with his best friend and then girlfriend. Now, this was like six years ago, but I had understood him to tell me that he had only gone with his best friend, though I may have just assumed. \nI got upset looking at the photos and stuff, but it was just weird/hard seeing him with someone else. It also bothered me that he doesn\u2019t have any photos of us on the computer, even though he\u2019s taken the camera on various trips. \n\nI guess my question is, do I bring up the fact that I saw the photos to him and let him know that it bothers me that there aren\u2019t any of us, or do I just keep my feelings to myself and not bring up the past?",

You\u2019d make up a narrative in your head about it. He likely knows this and is making it easier for you. \n\nAs for telling him what you found, what do you hope to gain from that? And what do you hope to gain from asking why there are no photos of you on his computer? \n\nYou\u2019re both in your late 20s. I\u2019m actually very surprised that you are having the feelings you are. They are valid, it\u2019s just weird to me that you felt any sort of way seeing him with his ex. I really expected the pictures to be nudes or something.",

He just went on a trip with you.\n\nKeeping your feelings to yourself is not good enough.  You need to kill those feelings altogether.  He chose to marry you.  He undoubtedly has a lot of animosity against his ex because of the abuse you say she committed against him.\n\nYou are the *winner*.  You got the good one and he doesn't want to dredge up feelings about this woman.  He's not going to delete photos of a presumably happy trip from more than a half-decade ago, and you should be pleased that every morning you wake up next to him.\n\nTreat this as a nothing.  Remember that he's with you because you're the woman he wants.  Don't raise the topic of this woman moving forward.  **Love him**.",

He may not look at those pics for the next thirty years, but it is certainly his right to keep them if he wants to keep them...And it's no reflection on you or your relationship with him.\n\nWork on your insecurity which you've already acknowledged is an issue.

            "comment": "Here's how you do it. Sit him down, tell him straight up: \"I found these old photos of you and your ex. It was hard for me to see them.\" No blame, no attack, just your feelings. It's not about the ex, it's about how this discovery made you feel. This is about the here and now, not a ghost from six years ago.\n\n  \nNow, about the lack of photos of you two - that's another issue. Be direct. \"I've noticed we don't have many pictures together. I'd love for us to start documenting our memories.\" It's a reasonable request, no need to compare or compete with past relationships. Your love story deserves its own album.\n\n  \nMost importantly, keep the conversation open and honest. This isn't a cage match, it's a partnership. Communication is the key, and being upfront about your insecurities isn't a sign of weakness, it's strength. You guys are about to be parents. Now's the time to tackle any and all anxieties head on, together. You're in this for the long haul, make sure the ride is as smooth as it can be. And remember, your relationship is your journey, don't let old snapshots from a different time cloud your view of the road ahead. You've got this.",

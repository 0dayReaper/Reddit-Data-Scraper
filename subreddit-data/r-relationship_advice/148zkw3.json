    "postText": "My(25F) boyfriend(28M) agreed to make our yearly vacation a \u201cguys trip only\u201d.\n\nVacation changed to guys trip\n\nHello! \n\nMy boyfriend and I have been planning a vacation for over 5 months now. His dad and brother are supposed to meet us there and hang out for a couple of days. I have found the hotel, events to go to, restaurants to eat at, and everything else. I was so excited as it has been about a year since our last vacation and we work a lot. Our relationship is kind of suffering and this is the light at the end of the tunnel for me. I was so excited to finally get some much needed time away with my boyfriend and our dog. But, no. \n\nPlans changed last night without my knowing. He was on the phone with his dad on the couch right next to me when the update came that he actually just wants it to be a guys trip and didn\u2019t want me or our dog to go. I suddenly became uninvited. My boyfriend did not end up telling me until, 24 hours after the phone call and him finding out. Only after I asked him what his dad said yesterday, thinking it was some kind of update, was I informed our vacation was off and it was just him going now. We have been together for 3 years and his dad just learned my name a year ago. I feel so disrespected and betrayed. I do not want to be the bad guy and make him not go on a fun vacation, but at the same time lack confidence in our relationship because of this. Do I take my own vacation during the same dates or stay at home and potentially have him feeling sorry for me?",

If you didn't ask he probably wouldn't have said anything until you called him when he left without you. \n\nHe doesn't respect you, and/or something else is going on he's not telling you about. This isn't normal especially when you were planning the trip together. \n\nIf the place you were going to stay or anything is in your name you can go and stay and not let him stay, or you can cancel it without his knowledge and ruin his trip. You might even be able to call and cancel without it being in your name knowing the details of everything. \n\nThe relationship is probably over, however you could try talking to him and tell him how this makes you feel, assuming you haven't done this already...",

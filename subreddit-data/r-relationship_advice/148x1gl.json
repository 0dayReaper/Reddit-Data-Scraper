    "postText": "My ex broke up with me 2 months ago we were together for 7 months. Prior to being with me she was in an extremely unhealthy mentally and emotionally abusive relationship. She gave herself no time to process that relationship before getting with me. She would attest to this that I treated her better than anyone ever has and that I know how to treat a women, I made it a priority for her to feel safe with me and she even commented on how I make her feel safe. She suffers from depression and essentially hates herself she sees no good in herself. I tried my best to support her through everything. It got so bad that we stopped being intimate with each other, this went on for about 3 months. Throughout our entire relationship she hated when I said things like \u201cwe should go here someday\u201d as that implied that we would be together in the future. She kept a secret from me for around 4 months about when her and her ex broke up, she said that I was the greatest thing to ever happen to her and she was afraid that I would leave her. I took the news surprisingly well and assured her that I\u2019m not leaving but i am hurt. After 24 hours I met with her and cleared the air and we got through that. She noticed that I wasn\u2019t going to give up on her and that scared her, eventually she started to drift away from me and for about 4-5 days she didn\u2019t text me first and gave 2-3 responses to my texts and took hours to respond. She later on broke up with me saying that it truly has nothing to do with me and that I\u2019m an amazing person and that I know how to treat a women. She said she just can\u2019t be in a relationship right now and that she needs to be alone (she has always been from relationship to relationship), and that she knows that she hurts me (always being emotionally unavailable, not intimate, and always getting mad at me when I say we will be together in the future) and she doesn\u2019t want to do that. When she told her parents the news, her mother texted me saying that I\u2019m and amazing person and that they are grateful for having met me, her mother told her to never block me as I\u2019m not someone that deserves that. I\u2019m slowly getting through the grieving and have gotten a lot better as I have realized that unfortunately there\u2019s a good chance that she never really loved me as she always had a foot out the door. We have been in no contact for 2 months she reached out to me 2 days after the breakup having a mental breakdown and I calmed her down but I told her that this can\u2019t be happening if we aren\u2019t together it\u2019s not fair to me and she agreed. 2 weeks after the breakup for some stupid reason I asked to meet up with her to get some sort of closure and to say thank you for all the memories and that I\u2019m not mad at her or anything of that sort. About a week ago she unfollowed and removed me from her following on all social media. To anyone that has been in a similar position do you think she will ever come back?",

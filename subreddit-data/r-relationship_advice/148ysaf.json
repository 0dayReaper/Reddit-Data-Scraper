    "postText": "I (52m) go down on my gf (50f) and get her off before PIV every single time we have sex. I often go down on her and get her off and then just let her fall asleep without getting off myself. It\u2019s fine. I enjoy pleasing her.\n\nShe very rarely returns the favor. Like, maybe once or twice a year and never to completion. I\u2019ve never really complained much, even though it kind of sucks\u2026 no pun intended. \n\nAnyway. She has made some comments lately both to me and to friends at a party (that I overheard) about how she thinks it\u2019s gross to give blowjobs. \n\nI picked her up from a girls night on The weekend where she was completely drunk. We got home, went to bed, and she basically threw herself on me. Asked me to eat her, sat on my face, got off. I tried to motion her down to do the same to me and she said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to do that because it will make me throw up,\u201d and then went to sleep. \n\nSo, I feel like a disgusting piece of shot now and don\u2019t know what to do about it or how to feel better. For what it\u2019s worth, I shower, shave down there, keep it clean, and have a pretty nice looking D imho. What\u2019s a guy to do here? I do t even mind the lack of reciprocity so much as I feel shitty for made to feel like I\u2019m disgusting",

Totally reasonable concern and definitely something that can happen. Even among women who like blowjobs. I don't think it was a comment about you.\n\nSo I wouldn't take that one occasion to mean anything. I think it's separate from the other issue which is that she just doesn't like giving them, which there's not much you can do about. As you said, it kind of sucks, but I think accepting it and continuing to be a generous lover is the right decision.\n\nEdit: much more than your girlfriend's oral sex habits, your post history of commenting on 18 year old girls pictures as a man almost old enough to be their grandfather would be what I consider to be the most problematic thing in your relationship.",

Don't try to make it into an insult when it's not personal. You can complain about the lack of oral sex reciprocity without pretending she called YOU disgusting. \n\nI think this is something you have to either accept or move on. Pretending she insulted you is manipulative. What's she supposed to do? Suck you off as an I'm sorry?

His girlfriend could just as easily \"get to finish\" the old fashioned way too, but that is not the point. It is about intimacy, fun, and reciprocation.  \n\nAs to my age, let's just say that i am MARRIED to a woman in her (early) 50s and she is a willing and enthusiastic partner.  As we both should be.",

But if it\u2019s a woman it\u2019s still all your fault. \n\nAs for the gag reflex thing, y\u2019all know that deepthroating isn\u2019t the only (or even best imho) way to perform oral an a penis right? Like\u2026there are more options than \u201croll over and sleep\u201d or \u201cthroatfuck for an hour\u201d.\n\nMy dude, your feelings are valid and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re getting the firing squad here for feeling hurt that your wife doesn\u2019t seem to show affection or concern for you. It isn\u2019t fair and I don\u2019t have much of a solution other than to tell you it won\u2019t change and you need to seriously consider if it\u2019s something you can live with or not.",

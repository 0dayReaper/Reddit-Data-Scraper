    "postText": "So I\u2019ve been dating my boyfriend for about 5 months. I\u2019ve met his immediate family a few times before and got along with them well. He\u2019s the man of my dreams, like actual perfection, so it\u2019s important to me that his family likes me. Anyways, yesterday they had a huge family reunion at his cousins beach house and invited me to tag along. Everyone got pretty drunk and of course as the juices were flowing everyone was friendlier and I ended up getting along super well with some of his aunts and siblings. \n\nAt some point my boyfriend stepped away and went to go help his younger brother with something. I was left alone with his older brother and we were sitting next to each other on a bench. Him and I have the same sense of humor and like I said we were all pretty drunk. At one point I told a stupid joke and he grabbed just above my knee and was laughing so hard he leaned over and slid his hand down to my ankle and held it there for a second until he composed himself. While it didn\u2019t make me uncomfortable, i was questioning how appropriate it was. Im not sure if it was flirty physical content or if he was drunk and just didn\u2019t know what he was doing. He\u2019s made jokes in the past about thinking I\u2019m hot, but my boyfriend claims that\u2019s his personality. I told my boyfriend about the leg grab and was surprised he didn\u2019t really care. \n\nBut here\u2019s what\u2019s bothering me. Later, we were all talking about our jobs and he jokingly started talking smack on mine (I work at Hollister while doing my masters) and I covered my hand over his mouth and told him to shut up. In hindsight I shouldn\u2019t have done it but I was still drunk and tbh I didn\u2019t think it\u2019s inappropriate. It was all funny and light hearted, but my boyfriend immediately pulled me aside and said to keep my hands to myself cause I was making him uncomfortable by touching his brother. Yet he didn\u2019t seem to care his brother grabbed my leg? Idk this isn\u2019t that big of a deal but I\u2019m lightly annoyed that he called me out over something so small but acts like his brother grabbing my leg was nothing and doesn\u2019t say anything when his brother makes jokes about finding me attractive. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just reading into it, but something about it seems wrong. Should I talk to my boyfriend about my feelings on this or just forget about it?",

I\u2019m not saying that IS the reason why but I couldn\u2019t think of a more uncomfortable situation tbh",

I will say though I have a brother, and I know for a fact if my gf did that to him, my mum would have a problem with it (I can already hear her in my head haha) \n\nHonestly though your bf said he wasn\u2019t comfortable with it so the best thing to do I think would be to respect that! And if his brother keeps making remarks and touching you say something to him or your boyfriend and hopefully they will show the same respect! I do think this was nothing though so I wouldn\u2019t be stressing too much about it",

And don\u2019t let them say to you \u201cthat\u2019s just him\u201d again if it makes you uncomfortable they don\u2019t get to say it doesn\u2019t, and hopefully he respects that!

    "postText": "Link to the previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i02wzl/mym21_gff23_obsession_with_pokemon_is_embarassing/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\nTl;dr: Turns out you all were right, I was an asshole. My friends are no longer welcomed in our house and now I'm playing with my gf.\n\nI've decided to post this update becauce you were all right. I didn't have a gf problem. I had friends problem.\n\nSo I had a talk with my gf like one of the users have suggested. I explained to her that I'm not ashamed of her hobby, I just didn't want her to know what our friends were saying behind her back. She said she doesn't care about their opinion, she's just doing what she's enjoying the most. I apologized to her. She has also agreed to move her pokemon plushies so they wouldn't take up so much space.\n\nFast forward to today, few hours ago our friends have visited us. It didn't take long for them to start making fun of my gf. This time I got mad - she organized her plushies so they were all in our bedroom, she has not even once mentioned pokemons nor did she opened pokemon go app. \n\nLong story short they were forced to leave. I've realized they don't have problem with my gf hobby - they have problem with my gf and I have enabled their behaviour by not reacting sooner. Told them they are the ones who needs to grow up &amp; to visit us again once they will stop being boomers.\n\nTo show my gf how sorry I'm and to better understand her hobby I've downloaded the app myself. So now I'm trying to level up as much as I can because she has a mission when she needs to trade a pokemon with a friend, but to do so I need to be at least 10 lvl.\n\nThank you for all your comments, even the mean ones - they worked as a wake up call I guess.",

You are an awesome person.\n\nIn my opinion, the true self is not based upon just the actions in how you deal with your day to day. But when hardship happens, what path you choose to take, and how you take it.\n\nTake great pride in your ability to look at yourself and accepting what you were doing wrong, and finding a path to better yourself and your relationship. It's more rare than you'd think. Also never ever lose that ability. We will forever need to discover things within ourselves that we could do better in a moment of difficulty.",

My coordination for things like that is non-existant, and I just don't really have the motivation to try and learn. We still found a way to \"play video games together\". I especially like the resident evil series, last of us, fallout, games like that. He plays the game, and I sit with him and cheer him on (\"You go baby! Shoot those zombies!! Get em'!! Oh no, it's behind you!\"), help him solve puzzles, talk about the story line, and help him find loot and organize his weapons stash. It probably looks hilarious and lame from the outside, but we spend hours doing this. He gets to play games, I get to support his hobby, and we get to spend time together. It's the best.",

We're two introverts who live in a tiny apartment, so we're pretty good at spending time together while doing our own thing. He used to just hang out and play his games while I did homework so he could keep me company, so I think he also enjoys the \"alone, together\" feeling. Now that I'm out of school and have time for leisure activities, he had me teach him how to cross stitch and we do that together while watching old 90's action movies (one of my fav things). I feel privileged that I found someone who I can sit in silence with or talk to for hours, and neither ever gets boring.\n\n\nYou're right about the horror game movie night too, graphics these days are so good that these games are basically a super choose your own adventure movie with the ability to restart when you make the wrong choice. It's amazing, can't wait to see what the PS5 will be like.",

The story line is amazing, the graphics surprisingly clear, the voice acting convincing, the dialogue truly varied from character to character, good sound track, and so on.  And I'm not a gamer by any means. Too many buttons and stats for my analog hands-on brain to handle. \n\n I've sat with him and crocheted, doodled, seen patches on a friend's battle jacket, and trimmed my nails all while watching him play. Occasionally he'll actually invite in to join him or insist that he's coming up on a scene that I've just gotta see.  I wish we would go outside together more, but he could live locked up in a basement with no sunlight and be perfectly content.  But the gaming is something, and I do enjoy that time together.",

Jessie and James don't get the respect they deserve.\n\nThey are actually very competent trainers when battling anyone but the main cast. The problem is that they routinely pit themselves against Gym Leaders and Champions, the best of the best!\n\nIn addition, Jessie and James clearly love Pokemon. They have strong bonds with their own, and James even managed to tame one without catching it. This is clearly very at odds with the rest of Team Rocket, who are not afraid to hurt pokemon to advance their goals. So long as Jessie and James are hunting \"that kid's Pikachu\" they don't have to engage in the shadier of Rocket's activities",

Good for you you realized this and defended her. \n\nYour GF also sounds like a strong and mature woman who happens to have a hobby.\n\nFYI: Good story about Pokemon-  my friend recently finished her cancer treatments.  Pokemon Go was one of the few games that kept her sane while on chemo. The hospital itself was a gym and she enjoyed her time conquering it.",

No rush while you level up and stuff, but at some point you might want to pick up the Team Medallion in the shop and sync up. That way you can work together to take down gyms, get boosts for raids, and other stuff.\n\nThis was a fantastic update btw! So great to see how well you two handled this. Enjoy the game! My wife and I (both 35 years old) play all the time. If you need tips, friends, or whatever feel free to message me.",

There is nothing wrong with having a hobby, and anyone (especially at our age) who makes fun of someone for that is immature and rude. Thank you for listening to the advice you were given and stepping up and realizing what you could\u2019ve done and taking the chance to change it. You recognized the actual problem (that it was your friends, not her), took action (stood up for her and kicked them out), and showed with your actions that you truly do care (downloading the game and playing it with her.)\n\nI\u2019m sure your girlfriend appreciates it. Thanks for being open to the advice you were given and doing something about it. You don\u2019t see that a lot on this thread.",

If the worst thing that you can say about a guy is that he's into video games then honestly... I'd hold onto him. I hate to say it but besides the one I'm with, I can't remember the last time I met a nice guy with a career, and plans for the future... \n\nI'm not saying it doesn't get frustrating... if he's paying way more attention to the games than you than you you might need to talk to him but my approach is, I'm attempting to play Pokeball with him. He tries to show an interest in what I like (Fleabag) so I'm doing the same. :)",

You can find new and better friends, but for now you have each other and that\u2019s what matters. \n\nBefore you know it, you\u2019ll be hooked into the Pok\u00e9mon go world!",

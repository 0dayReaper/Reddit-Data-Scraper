    "postText": "My boyfriend of five years- who doesn't try to get a practical job for five years recently got into streaming. He's big with the female community \" Just chatting\". He posts \ud83d\ude0d on a girl's photo who does not have a lot of followers. They both follow each other on instagram, In addition, he is going to a convention on the west coast without me and doesn't want me to go with him.  Plus the conventions has these girl streamers and cosplayers, would you be concerned? ( that he talks to online). Plus he admits to me he doesn't want to tell people he has a girlfriend.\n\nHe doesn't publicly \ud83d\ude0d any of my photos. Recently I had papillary thyroid cancer and he doesn't seem to emotionally support me either. He went to his job the day of my surgery. \n\nIn addition, there are lots of pluses I have: 1. I come from a millionaire family and we have 4 properties 2. I look a bit like Taylor Swift ( I'm tall, thin, and have blue-green eyes 2. I have a good paying job over 100k each year 3. I have a flat stomach 4. I think I'm pretty cute when I try 5. Papillary thyroid cancer is very curable but I'm 160,000 in debt from my education, the cancer, and I live with my family.\n\nHe on the other hand 1. Has some lack teeth 2. Makes much less money than me 3. Can't pay his bills 4.Doesn't investigate his health (so how does he know he's okay?- I worry about this. 5. Lives with his family \n\nHe's wanted to move in with me but I don't want or I'll lose my inheritance and I'm scared of financially supporting him.\n\nWould you be as livid as I am?",

Relationships are not supposed to be judged by slights and statuses. You had way too many counterpoints prepared for someone who wishes to continue this relationship. You don\u2019t need our blessing.",

I\u2019m an extremely self-conscious person and really all I want someone that likes me and compromises with me on my values and sees similarly.

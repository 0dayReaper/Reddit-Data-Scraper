    "postText": "I've (30M) have been dating a girl (28F) and my friend (22M) is getting in the way. I feel betrayed\n\nI think my \"friend\" likes the same girl I've been seeing...\n\nSo, I've been seeing some girl for about 6 months... nothing is official but we hang out, go on dates, stays over, and have been intimate. The girls from work, I am 30 and she is 28. \n\nHowever, my friend who works on the same team has always been friendly with her... he's 22 and with all due respect he is not good looking. Only work friends, they've never spoke outside of work prior\n\nSince we've been hooking up, she's been speaking to him about me and obviously asking for advice etc, seeing as he knows me quite well from work.\n\nHowever recently he has been seeing her outside of work, going for walks and such to \"speak\". He keeps saying he needs to speak to her about his issues too. \n\nHe constantly texts her when we are out together, texts he misses her and he loves her (in a joking way, but I'm starting to think there is more to it now). He keeps dragging her away in work to speak to her. I don't want to say anything as she's free to do as she wishes. But it is starting to get me down as it's so obvious.\n\nHe doesn't contact me anymore since he's started to go for walks...\n\nShe did say to me that she thinks maybe he might like her but doesn't know what to say because she doesn't like him in that way. I didn't really carry the conversation on as I don't want to come across as \"that guy\"\n\nI'm not concerned at all anything will happen between them - that isnt my issue. However, it's bothering me that it's affecting my time with her... I don't know what he could be saying too... and I feel kind of betrayed by him.\n\nI want to confront him but, I'm pretty sure he won't admit that he does like her. Then, I feel he may go back and say I am trying to stop them being friends?\n\nHow do I go about this? Do I just cut ties and keep it professional in work? Do I confront him (what do I say), or do I speak to her?",

If he's mad about his coworker taking her time, then he's going to be pissed when she starts seeing someone else and makes it official. You snooze you lose, drag your ass and end up forced to move on. There's no reason to drag this out for 6 months. I feel 3 months is to long as well. Most couples make it official by month 2. I've always made it official before 1 month is done. You either know what you want or you don't. Simple as that. I've known my coworker for almost a year and have been together for nearly 4 months. It took \"hanging out\" for two weeks for us to become official. Now I want to marry her, it feels right.",

Just know, nobody likes to wait for someone to come around...\n\nI did this with my current partner took me probably 6 months to make it official, but we were exclusively dating. I just didn't wanna put a label on it due to my own personal problems, which I was up front about and she was a loving partner who accepted and waited for me to be ready for her. \n\nGood luck and thank you for serving your country \ud83d\ude4f",

He kept saying he didn't think he could handle a relationship; I was like babe, we are IN a relationship.\n\nWhen I met my boyfriend I literally told him night one I was looking for a life partner. He's been the best and most committed partner I've ever had. People need to learn to just advocate for what they want, it's not a binding contract.",

When I voiced my feelings for him he told me he didn\u2019t want a relationship. He asked me on dates. Spent a few nights a week hanging out and being vulnerable. Sleeping in my bed. There were so many times I wanted to look over at him and say \u201cyou know this is a relationship, right? It\u2019s a shitty, undefined one but it has all the elements of a relationship. Even if you don\u2019t want to call it what it is.\u201d Eventually I broke things off and he came back around to apologize for not handling his emotions in a healthy way and admitted I deserved a lot better than the empty version of him that I got. Things aren\u2019t perfect, but we love and get each other. I know our situation isn\u2019t typical, but it finally did work itself out and we\u2019ve been really happy in a committed relationship.",

They get so excited about taking the step to \"exclusively dating\". For me, I date one person at a time. So, early on I'll have that \"talk\" to make sure we're on the same page, but generally the steps are dating then being together. Not sure where this extra step in the middle came from. I'm not sure if people in the US do this as well these days.\n\nIn OP's case, they're not really dating. Different situation altogether, honestly. Casually hooking up has no implications of exclusivity. Doesn't sound like they've ever talked about dating each other.",

It probably won't mean that she treats you differently during hang outs, but it definitely would kill the looming spectre of someone else dating her. I know I know you think this guy is an uggo, but that doesn't mean he's not *trying* to date her. Right now she's free to date him.\n\nI also think it'd be good to tell her that he has distanced himself from you since she and he got closer. That should tell her everything she needs to know about his intentions and integrity. She's already doubting him, I really think she'll reduce that relationship a lot upon hearing that information.\n\nI agree with others that there's no need to confront him. Just keep your distance.",

If you're worried about it not coming out right when you say it, write it down and think about what you want to say. I would not say anything about that guy at all, don't even bring him up and since you're not \"official\" it would probably just look possessive. How you feel is validated though, it doesn't come off to me like you're trying to be controlling but you do care about her and want to see this go somewhere. If you start being officially a couple, and then this guy is crossing boundaries then you can ask her how she feels about how he speaks to her (if he is saying things like I love you etc, regardless if it's a \"joke\"). If she says she isn't bothered and isn't worried about him, I'd try to let it go. It's a slippery slope in that territory, and you don't want genuine concern to come off as something else. \n\nI would advise not saying anything to dude about this. Be the more mature person in the situation, remain cordial at work - nothing more, nothing less. If this guy knows that you two have been seeing each other how you have, and he is supposed to be your friend - I understand you can't always control your feelings for someone but you can control your behavior towards them. I hope for the future or even if this is happening now, that if dude is making her feel uncomfortable or anything that she can set some healthy boundaries with him. No matter what happens, just try and be supportive.  I think it's kind of weird that he is giving her advice or whatever it is he is doing, that it's being given about you. He doesn't know you better than you know you - so there is really no place for him to be saying anything. I don't like the thought of anyone speaking for me but me. Maybe try and find a way to make her feel secure enough in her choices and/or words, her actions towards you - that she doesn't feel like she needs to ask that guy for advice.\n\nEdit: grammar",

Consider what bothers you the most about the situation and how it impacts your relationship with both your friend and the girl you're dating.\r  \n\r  \nCommunicate with the girl you're seeing: It's important to have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings. Express that you've noticed the increased interaction between her and your friend and how it's affecting you. Listen to her perspective and try to understand her thoughts and intentions.\r  \n\r  \nEvaluate your friendship: Assess the value and trustworthiness of your friendship with the 22-year-old friend. Consider whether his actions and behavior align with the qualities you expect in a friend. It may be helpful to discuss your concerns with other trusted friends or family members to gain different perspectives.\r  \n\r  \nConfrontation or conversation: Depending on your comfort level and the dynamics of your relationships, you can choose to address the situation directly with your friend. Approach the conversation calmly and express your concerns without being accusatory. Give him the opportunity to share his side of the story and listen to his response. Remember to keep the conversation respectful and avoid getting confrontational.\r  \n\r  \nSet boundaries: If the situation persists and continues to impact your relationship with the girl you're dating, it might be necessary to establish clear boundaries. Communicate your expectations and concerns to both your friend and the girl, emphasizing the importance of respecting your relationship and giving it the space it needs.\r  \n\r  \nSeek support: Reach out to trusted friends or family members who can provide guidance and support during this challenging time. Sharing your feelings with others can help you gain valuable insights and different perspectives.\r  \n\r  \nPrioritize your well-being: Ultimately, focus on your own well-being and happiness. Evaluate whether the situation is worth the emotional toll it's taking on you. If necessary, consider distancing yourself from the friend if the behavior continues to negatively impact your mental and emotional state.\r  \n\r  \nRemember, communication and understanding are key in navigating such situations. Trust your instincts and make decisions that align with your values and personal growth.",

She is the entertaining both of you, but if why you say is true that she doesn\u2019t like him in a romantic way then I don\u2019t understand what the issue is?? You need to talk to her about your situationship and what you both want, a friendship, a friendship with benefits or if there is a potential for you two to date. If he likes her and she isn\u2019t telling him the truth that she only has platonic feelings for him then it would see she is leading him on. He hasn\u2019t betrayed you because you and her are not in a relationship so she\u2019s free to do and see whoever she wants until you guys decided exactly what you two are. \n\nYou also may not know the whole story, maybe he\u2019s going through something outside of work and he finds it easy to open up and talk with her. She is allowed to have friends and do whatever else she wants to do. \n\nTo me, this sounds like a communication problem. You need to seek clarification from her about where things are headed. If you have romantic feelings towards her then you need to talk to her about it and find out what her feelings and intentions are towards you. \n\nGood luck op! I hope you get things figured out between you and her and your other coworker but in my perspective he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong nor betrayed you, she needs to be clear about what her intentions are between the two you!!

Why not sit down with her and talk about what relationship you each want, do you want it to be exclusive and do you want to do more than \"hang out\" and \"hook up\" like, you know, date? If you are both in agreement to date, then things move forward. If you aren't ready for that conversation, you are in no position to stop her, or your friend, from spending time together.",

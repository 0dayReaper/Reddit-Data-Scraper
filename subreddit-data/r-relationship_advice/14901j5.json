    "postText": "My ex and I dated for about two years, but he ended up cheating on me with my step sister. It\u2019s been over a year since I found out, but I still have so much anger and hatred in my heart. I feel like i\u2019ve moved on in the sense that I don\u2019t want to be with him, but I haven\u2019t moved on from what happened. Additionally, the cheating isn\u2019t even what bothers me the most. his family and my step family treated me like shit afterwards. they blamed it on me to make the other two look better. I don\u2019t know what to do. I heard he bought an engagement ring for his new girlfriend, and im just angry. not that it\u2019s not me, but that he gets to move on and be happy while im stuck with trauma and trust issues. Does anyone have any advice on how to move past this? I feel like i\u2019m stuck at this point of hating him but there\u2019s nothing to do about it. I\u2019ve tried journaling, hobbies, friends, etc. I just want to move on and enjoy a relationship but i can\u2019t help but feel like every guy is like him. Should I just keep doing what Im doing or should I do something different?",

            "comment": "Since your situation is very unpleasant (cheating +  blaming of your step family and family of your ex), Im sure its very hard. But i don\u2019t think theres anything much to do. I would advise that you cut contact with your ex, block him everywhere and do anything you can to distance yourself from him if you already didn\u2019t.\n\nNow you gotta live through it. If you can go to therapy. My mother always told me that you have to grieve at least 40 days after breaking up with someone, which was very true in my case, it would even be longer sometimes. Do what you are doing already. Whatever makes you feel comfortable, good and content with yourself. Treat yourself on good days. Celebrate small successes, alone or with friends. When you have bad days let them be bad but try to cheer yourself up with comfortable things such as journaling or watching a movie. \n\nI hope you will soon move on. In the end of the day, it always gets better. Good luck!",

            "comment": "Definitely keep doing hobbies and keeping your mind entertained. Keep your mind busy by picking more shifts at work, working out more if you already are working out find new interests that maybe you\u2019ve always thought about doing but you didn\u2019t have a chance to. Keep yourself busy and keep your mind active at all times. The other part is going to have to be work on your end, meaning that when you start thinking about him, you need to push those thoughts as your head with other things. Maybe of something in the future that you\u2019re really excited about doing, maybe something positive about yourself. I would also look at getting some counseling to help you learn some other coping mechanisms to get past this. And also if you have a good friend or a good family member that you can just sometimes blow some steam to that\u2019s another way to help you. It\u2019s going to take some time, so just focus on yourself and don\u2019t date.",

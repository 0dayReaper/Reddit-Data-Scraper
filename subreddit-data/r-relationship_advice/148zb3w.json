    "postText": "Hi, so I\u2019ve been in this relationship with my boyfriend for over 3 years now. We\u2019ve had a lot of ups and downs, and recently had to move out from each other due to college and financial circumstances as he lost his job about a month ago. Prior to this, I had moved in with him and got a new job in his area. However the past 6 months he has been a completely different person. He\u2019s been battling depression and just seems like someone I don\u2019t know. He says himself he doesn\u2019t know who he is and wishes he could get back to it. I feel like he pushes me away. Months ago he told me he loved me, but wasn\u2019t in love with me and wishes he could get back to it. That broke pieces of me, but I\u2019ve stayed along for the ride, because I love him and to me he is my \u201cit\u201d. But lately he is so detached, and every time I open myself up to communicate he isn\u2019t there. I\u2019ve been trying so hard to help him with his daily struggles and have always made it clear I\u2019m here if he needs support. Financially (he\u2019s never taken money from me), emotionally, physically, mentally and spiritually. He always texts me the same with \u201cI know\u201d \u201cwyd\u201d \u201canyways\u201d give or take a few pet names like baby and love. It\u2019s very repetitive and I\u2019ve let him know numerous times I feel like he is never in the conversation and doesn\u2019t pay attention to half the things I say. He says he\u2019ll call later when I ask, and then later, and then not at all because he doesn\u2019t feel like it. He says he doesn\u2019t like calling. He used to before, but now, no. I\u2019ve expressed that since we have to rely on texting now for a bit (we live an hour and a half away now) I would appreciate if he prioritized talking a bit more. Well today, he told me his best friend has been helping him get out of this hole, and I asked how I could help like him and he says it\u2019s because his friend (M 21) doesn\u2019t nag him or talk to him, he\u2019s just there. I expressed that a romantic relationship isn\u2019t like that, that there has to be communication, and It hurts to know he wishes I would stop trying to talk to him or \u201cnag\u201d him. He keeps saying nothing he does will be good enough when I ask to call and am upset when he puts it off and eventually makes an excuse, or when we just try to text. Another thing he says that makes him upset is he has a different love language, and that he doesn\u2019t like me talking to him about it but feeling respected? I just don\u2019t know how I could respect him further when I tell him I\u2019m proud of him for everything he\u2019s gotten better at and doing, and I always talk highly of him to everyone when they ask why he lost his job. I don\u2019t yell, scream, and I always give him slack because how it\u2019s been lately. When we\u2019re in person  our relationship is better, but we only see each other weekly now. I feel like he constantly gaslights me for missing him, but I don\u2019t know what to do since I love him. Advice?",

Since he lost his job that had insurance now it\u2019s just a money reason that he can\u2019t. To me, I don\u2019t think he would ever go to therapy because he doesn\u2019t like the idea of it. That\u2019s what he has said, anyway. I stopped pushing it because it made me feel like I was pushing him too much that it pushed him away. Just feel lost.",

Then.. he wasn\u2019t open with the idea, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something he honestly is ever going to go for? I\u2019m not sure. Other than that, nothing that I have noticed, I know that sounds bad but it\u2019s the truth thus far.\n\nAnd I do think space would be good, and I think our moving away from each other has helped that, but we really don\u2019t text too much to begin with. I get busy a lot of the time so really minimal texting during the day and he never calls me unless I call him, which he maybe lets happen once or twice a week?",

It isn't working for him because he probably feels you're sorry for him or think worse of him. It might also be that he just needs company and doesn't want to talk.\n\nRegardless, he needs professional help. But I don't see how you can raise the issue without being called \"nagging\" again.",

Knowing him that is what it sounds like, but before he lost his job he was making decent money, and has always held himself up to a certain standard so I think it\u2019s a big change for him. I just don\u2019t know how to support him during it because he won\u2019t tell me how, and I just get lashed out on during it. \n\nAnd I have tried finding resources for him and I\u2019ve found a few, but therapy isn\u2019t something he wants to do and he doesn\u2019t seem that open to the idea of meds. He says being busy helps him and so lately he\u2019s been doing house projects with the friend I talked about during the post and he has said that helped. Which is amazing, because before that he was in bed or playing games most of the day so it\u2019s progress.",

In the meanwhile, you could continue texting and calling him up (maybe ask him to talk more or talk more yourself - don't expect a conversation, either be a listener or a speaker). It might help him to listen to you talking and it might help him if you listen to whatever he has to say (without making unnecessary comments, but do ask occasional simple questions that show you are listening). Once his new job begins, see if the situation improves. Often people are themselves too spent to show affection to others and he seems to be in that zone now. \n\nBut at the same time, maybe try to engage in your hobbies or things that help you relax, take your mind off him a bit. I know how difficult it is to be in a relationship where you constantly feel like your partner isn't invested anymore and how difficult it is to say anything because of their personal problems. Best of luck and I hope you two get over this soon.",

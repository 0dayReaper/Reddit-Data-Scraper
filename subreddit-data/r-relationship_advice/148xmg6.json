    "postText": "Is this relationship worth fixing?\n\nJust a couple of days ago, I made the difficult decision to end my relationship with my girlfriend. We had been together for a while, but over time, I noticed a pattern of failed communication and a lack of prioritization in our relationship. Despite promising to improve, she continued to prioritize other things over us.\n\nThe breaking point came when I traveled for hours to her city, only to find out she had fallen asleep in a different house. I waited for hours, feeling worried and concerned for her well-being, but she didn't apologize or show any remorse when she finally woke up. In fact, she seemed indifferent to the worry she had caused me and even made excuses when I confronted her.\n\nOne incident after another led me to question the foundation of our relationship. I extended an invitation for her to visit me, as I had already spent so much time and effort to see her, but she claimed to be too unwell to travel. However, she had no problem getting ready to attend a rave that I was going to go to. It hurt me deeply to see her disregard my feelings and dismiss the impact of her actions.\n\nFeeling hurt and disrespected, I made the difficult decision to block her on all platforms and cut off communication. While part of me still wishes things could work out, I know deep down that true change is necessary for any hope of a future together. I'm focusing on myself now, taking the time to heal and grow.\n\nWe had planned to attend a festival together, and our flights are booked on the same day. I will be seeing her during the check-in time, and I'm unsure how to handle the situation. Part of me wants her to approach me for a private conversation, where we can potentially address the issues and maybe find a way to reconcile. But at the same time, I'm prepared to enjoy the festival and reject any attempts at reconciliation if she doesn't show any signs of care or remorse.\n\nThe thing is, I have no idea how things will go down when we see each other. It feels like there are so many possibilities. She might confront me about what her friends said behind her back, or she could completely avoid me. On the other hand, she might put on a friendly face and say hi, or even throw some comments during our conversations. All the possibilities are realistic as I\u2019ve been there when she has done all of them in different situations.",

You have nothing to talk to her about. She\u2019s shown you with her actions and words how little she thinks of you",

She doesn\u2019t appreciate the effort and work you\u2019ve put in for her. Some people just don\u2019t change, no matter how many times they say they will. Go find someone who appreciates you travelling hours to go to their city and see them.",

While not a given, you shouldn't be surprised if she has someone else in tow at the Festival. Sounds like she's had one foot out the door on the relationship for a while.",

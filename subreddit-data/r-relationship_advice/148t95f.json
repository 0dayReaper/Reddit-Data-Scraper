    "postText": "We were sitting on the train and he was getting on my nerves because he was being annoying about something . I told him to fuck off and to leave me alone and he said and I quote: \u201cI swear I\u2019m gonna rape you in front of everyone on this train if you don\u2019t stop acting like a brat\u201d. He wasn\u2019t mad or anything . He said it so casually.\n\nI kept quiet because I didn\u2019t know how to respond to that. Earlier that day he had made another threat but I chose to let it go as he told me he was \u201cjust kidding.\u201d I was still shocked in the moment though.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that he said that because he thought it was funny but has no real intention of actually doing it. I\u2019m 100% sure. I\u2019ve been alone with him at his place hundreds of times, I\u2019ve gotten drunk around him and he\u2019s always been really protective, and he\u2019s never given me any reason not to trust him. We have been friends since we were 11. I just don\u2019t understand why he thought saying something like that TWICE was appropriate. I do understand that we\u2019re teenagers and teenagers say and do stupid stuff\u2026 but I don\u2019t know.",

    "postText": "I have been in the talking stage with this guy for a few weeks now. He started acting strange and \u201cacting up\u201d a few days ago saying that he was suicidal and wants me to not be with him because if he ever does end up committing he wouldn\u2019t want me to be alone. Now today he decides to tell me that his crazy toxic ex who still was on the same phone plan as him looked at our messages. She got jealous that he was talking to me. She wants to get back with him even though they have been broken up for 2 years. \n\nI didn\u2019t know she was looking at the messages but it does have my name and the place where i work at. I\u2019m so scared she will come to my work and do something to me. The scary part is that her family is part of a mafia and a lot of illegal stuff. That\u2019s what scares me the most. I don\u2019t want her to do anything to me or stalk me. \ud83d\ude22\n\nShe still is obsessed with the guy I\u2019m talking to. She was explaining to him how mad she was that he was talking to me and not to her. I asked him why he couldn\u2019t block her and he says that she always finds a way to get in contact with him. I\u2019m so scared and don\u2019t know what to do. He says if i don\u2019t feel safe then I should stop talking to him. But I really like him and he does too, but I don\u2019t want any problems with his crazy psychotic ex. I didn\u2019t know that she was in the picture until he told me today. I\u2019m very scared and lost and confused.",

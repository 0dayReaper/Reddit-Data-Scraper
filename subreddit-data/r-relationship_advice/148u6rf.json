    "postText": "It all goes back to childhood with my codependency with my mom and emotional incest. It\u2019s now affecting my romantic relationship with my partner. I (18f) haven\u2019t admitted to him(18m) that I am codependent towards him. I have hidden it pretty well I think but it\u2019s genuinely eating me alive. The story I\u2019m telling directly relates to my realization that I need help. I had an incident yesterday where I met up with an old friend and she(18) made dinner and I spent the night and she attempted to kiss me. I told her no straight away. I ended up going to sleep I was afraid to go home and leave her alone. I didn\u2019t want to leave her alone I was worried for her safety after her ex had shown up while I was there. He kept banging on the door begging to speak to her. She seemed super shook up so I didn\u2019t want to leave her. But then she tried to make a move on me. So I panicked told her to stop I have a partner and she knew that. Anyways I texted my boyfriend trying to ask him what I should do he never answered me. I ended up just dealing with it myself and just going to sleep and telling her to not do that again. The next morning (this morning) I told him everything that happened every single detail. He essentially just left me on read and did not respond. Now I feel defeated and worthless. Like oh you don\u2019t care anymore that means I\u2019m worthless. I feel like if he\u2019s gone I\u2019m just going no where and I\u2019m going to be alone forever. I care for him to much I do it with every romantic partner. It becomes an obsession and I wrap my entire like around them and plan with them. I have a hard time separating myself from them and me like I see us as one person. I can\u2019t keep doing this but I don\u2019t know how to stop. I\u2019m in therapy and I have my own hobbies and interests but it still doesn\u2019t stop my obsession with trying to be prefect and please partners. I know that the things I\u2019m doing a very irrational, but it just feels like I can\u2019t stop. Like any time it is good I feel the need to ruin it because why is it this good? It all has to be a lie there is no way that someone could care for me this much.",

    "postText": "Link to previous post [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aejrnr/i_28m_think_my_girlfriend_26f_of_four_years_is/?st=JQRWKQ4D&amp;sh=e1753ed8)\n\nI finally talked to my girlfriend about it and unfortunately, she is now my ex-girlfriend. A lot of things that I never expected to happen did happen in a span of hours. \n\nAs soon as she opened the door to our apartment, I could tell that she was already starting to cry. Seeing her so vulnerable like that also hurt because I didn\u2019t want to put her in that position. \n\nI had to constantly remind myself that none of this was my fault. \n\nWe sat down, there were lots of tears. I thought I would be bitter, angry and that I would be screaming at her the whole time but I felt disappointed instead. \n\nI told her that I saw the messages and explained how I ended up scrolling through their whole conversation. \n\nShe kept reasoning that she just felt sorry for him and that she didn\u2019t know how to say no to him because they go all the way back.\n\nThen I told her that WE go more way back than they ever did. I was there through her lowest point, I helped her get up.\n\nShe admitted that they had sex more than three times. \n\nI saw it coming, I had a gut feeling but hearing her confirm it hurt so much. At that point, I was full on crying. I can\u2019t remember some of the things that happened because my mind was all over the place. It still is now. \n\nI remember telling her that I was done, that whatever we had was over. She kneeled in front of me and asked me to forgive her, I don\u2019t think I ever will. I can\u2019t tolerate people who cheat.\n\nBy that point, a third of my clothes were packed up. \n\nObviously she feels happier with him if she can do this to me. \n\nWhen I posted my first post, a redditor approached me and offered me a place to stay. His place was only around fifteen minutes away from ours and he picked me up. He\u2019ll also help me sell a lot of my stuff that I can\u2019t bring back home and will help me gather all my things back in my apartment.\n\nWe both agreed that I don\u2019t mention him in this post. I\u2019m glad that I really opened up to this community instead of keeping it to myself. Thank you to everyone who also offered me a place. \n\nIt\u2019s almost 3am, I\u2019m heartbroken as ever but I\u2019m trying my best. I\u2019m sending my resignation letter to work this morning. Every person in my family now knows my situation here and have offered support. I\u2019ll be flying home as soon as possible. \n\nTo all my Aussie mates,  if you live near/around Chapel Hill, let me know! \n\nAmerica, you were great but now it\u2019s time to come home. Thanks for the help everyone.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m crying again, not because I got cheated on but because I realised that there is a whole world out there that cares a lot for my well being. I almost can\u2019t believe I looked at hurting myself as an option to get away from the pain. I am really overwhelmed and also thankful for this community.\n\nAnthony and his wife, the redditor who helped me says this has been the most wholesome thing that ever happened to him. \n\nI may have lost a girlfriend and a future wife, but I gained heaps of friends...and even friends for a lifetime. \n\nOther than that, I am feeling better. It still feels surreal that she\u2019s gone but what can a bloke do? She made her choice so I made mine. \n\nI woke up to multiple messages from her family saying that I shouldn\u2019t rush things and that she\u2019s stupid and makes mistakes like everyone else. \n\nIt sucks that I may not be able to see her family for a long time, they were great people. I thanked them and said that although I believe in second chances and everyone makes mistakes, cheating is a choice that assholes pick, never a mistake. \n\nEx also emailed me around 5 in the morning. the email was too long, my eyes hurt from crying so I junked it straight away. \n\nI miss her like crazy. I know it will take a lot of time to heal me but I guess I can wait. \n\nps. I\u2019ll message my newfound Aussie friends when I go through all the comments. Exact date of my flight hasn\u2019t been sorted out yet, but I\u2019m hoping i\u2019ll be home by next month.\n",

But I'd hate to see dude lose his job over a situation that isn't his fault...if it's a good job and career type shit.\n\nIf it was just a temporary gig then I get it completely \n\n",

She'll probably spend some time with her ex which will prevent her from having to process her feelings for OP and by the time they've separated (I expect that to happen before he dies, stage 1 cancer isn't a death sentence, dude just wanted some sympathy sex) she'll have enough distance from OP that it may never hit her at all. Happened with my last ex. I've been pining for 2 years and she's been with a half a dozen guys in the meantime. We've tried to stay friends because we were friends for 2 years before we dated but unfortunately that is an absolutely fucking terrible idea. ",

All i can say is dont think about taking them back. You will never be able to trust them ever again, it changes the whole relationship. \n\nIt takes a while to get over something like this. Took me close to 2 years before i could look back and laugh about with my asshole friends.\n\nJust keep your head up mate.",

Even if he survives that, it's very unlikely he would live more than 15 years. Pancreatic cancer is bad. ",

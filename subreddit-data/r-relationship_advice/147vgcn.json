    "postText": "In October of 2022 I left my boyfriend of almost 3 years due to emotional and physical abuse. I was already checked out of the relationship for awhile because of what was happening between us and I am pretty well off for my age due to the work field i'm in so I was able to move out soon after. \n\nFast forward to February, I met a guy (let's call him Anthony) and he seemed to be perfect. I struggle a lot with my mental health and he seemed to understand or at least try to with everything and would never get frustrated when I struggled and communicated he would never hurt me because of something I couldn't control. \nHe validated everything I felt which was new to me and he made me much more accepting of who I was and what I struggled with. \n\nWe were really happy together and made it official in April of 2023. Anthony also struggles with his mental health and I was able to help him get back on his feet throughout this time, I helped him get a job and go back to his therapy appointments. He met all of my friends and family and it really seemed like I was finally going to feel safe and happy with somebody rather than constantly putting a guard up. \n\nOne night while out to see a movie with him (about a month after making of official, and a few days after his first time posting a picture of me), I got an instagram DM during the movie. I opened it to see a message from his ex girlfriend letting me know that he has two different kids from two different moms. On top of this he hasn't paid child support. This was never mentioned to me at all. I made him leave the theater and I confronted him and said he was going to tell me eventually but was scared since it was a new relationship and the he has every intention of helping his kids but he needed to get back on his feet. \n\nOut of anger I made him take me home and leave me alone. Once I calmed down we talked about it and I told him we could be friends eventually. He explained that he still supports his kids but they live out of state. He is heartbroken and doing everything he can to fix it between the two of us but I still don't trust him for not telling me about that. I still have feelings for him but i'm so conflicted and feel like i'm stringing him along. \n\nI want to be with him, and on top of this i'm making the mistake of seeing him still and keeping it a secret from everyone. I don't know if i'm making a mistake by even still seeing him. I don't know what to do.\n\nShould I stay with him and give him another chance or leave him?",

You're just this convenient/good companionship and he'll take what he can get being 'on the run' like that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Should I stay with him and give him another chance or leave him?\n\nI'd say, cut your losses and thank your lucky stars that you're warned of his deception. You need to leave and you know this already, but you're just in a love bombed situation and you think you can 'fix' him etc and that's not going to happen. I promise you 100% that he will break you and you'll fall into one of those single mother statistic in the future.\n\nIf you stay, you have to expect him to neglect and abandon you if you have a child together. He's done this twice already to two different women and two different children. It's not going to be any different with you. I bet at least one of the baby mothers thought it'd be different with her only to find out that he's a deadbeat.\n\nSo don't expect him to be a good partner/father. Expect that he will not give you any child support and will leave the state so it'll be harder for him to be put on child support order.\n\nI'm sure if any of the baby mothers request state assistance, your bf now is on the hook for a lot of child support and he may get arrested one of these days (because I learned in the US, there's that debtor prison concept when it comes to not paying child support) and he may lose his driver's license, etc. \n\nHe may not even be able to travel abroad, so don't even bother asking, if he's on the hook for a certain amount of child support, his passport would be suspended, iirc.\n\nIn fact, I'm not surprised he's unemployed, or working under the table or jumping from job to job (since he doesn't want to pay CS). Because if the mothers of his children request child support garnishment via state/government, he'll be garnished...albeit, it'll take awhile since he's out of state from these baby mothers and their children. So there's that possibility he'll jump from one job to another b4 garnishment order takes effect.\n\nIf he's gotten a job, not under the table, the likelihood is he'll get garnished then he'll expect YOU to shoulder financial burden so don't fool yourself to thinking that the child support orders will not affect you financially too.\n\nPlease don't get pregnant by this person. Oh, and you may want to get tested too because he seems to be rather 'easygoing' with going 'bareback' let's just say.\n\nIf you finally brave yourself enough to leave, then I suggest counseling. Because you still choose the wrong partner or attract the wrong person and being unable to let go of bad elements, such as this guy as soon as you can.",

Haven\u2019t given up rights because I\u2019m not married to stepdad and I don\u2019t want to lose the very little child support I get, especially when I funded the pregnancy and first year of her life entirely.

But I do have it in writing from him that he literally wishes my child was never born and he doesn\u2019t ever want to meet her or her to even know about him so if he ever came back to try to be in the child\u2019s life I think those would sway the judge pretty easily.",

I feel this information is something he should of been open with in the beginning and when I say beginning, I mean the dating phase, right before you enter into a relationship with them. To not have you meet them is one thing and is very understandable until you both really set the groundwork in your relationship, but to not tell you about them at all in this time, and for you to have to find out this way too, I don\u2019t think this is something you can overlook especially if you\u2019re looking into having a family of your own in the future. If you want to commit to a relationship with someone who does have children, I say find someone that\u2019s proud of their children, that shares with you the details of their lives, their characteristics their accomplishments etc etc, and someone who is actively involved with their child\u2019s upbringing (either being physically a part of their lives, or whether that be by paying child support). \nI think you need to walk away here OP and tell him that he needs to work on being a better person and a better parent first before entering into another relationship especially if he is looking at procreating again in the future \ud83d\ude44",

If you need someone to validate what you are going through then you should be talking to a therapist, family member, or close friend NOT someone you are dating. It just isn't appropriate for a new relationship and it makes you a target for predatory people who see are that you are vulnerable. They are essentially someone who you've just met and it's not appropriate to rely on them in that way at this point. Don't date somebody who's a project  - if they aren't managing their own mental health and they're not employed they aren't ready to date. \n\nYou don't want to jump from serious relationship to serious relationship and you really don't want to trust the wrong person with your mental health concerns - this is why. You wind up overly committed to some sketchy asshole who has two kids and two baby mommas at 23. Of course you should dump him! He's a loser who took advantage of your vulnerability.",

He didn't tell me about her, until he knew he wanted to be with me long term. Because he had brought her up earlier in a different relationship and the woman took off. Didn't want to deal with a kid, and said negative things about him being a dad. All because he said I have a daughter who lives out of state with her mother. So he was shy about doing it again. \n\nOnce we made it official, he did tell me about her. \n\nHe has mental issues that made it hard for him to hold down a job, and he would get behind in his child support payments from time to time, but when he got a job and got on his feet, he made it up. He was struggling mentally, and didn't have any help or support. When we got engaged, I helped him get his mental wellness under control, and kept him on a straight and narrow, he paid his child support, and fought to be able to a part of his kids lives.\n\nHis ex, did the same as the ex in your situation. She tried to bad mouth him to me, and I simply told her that I know what is going on with his life, and I know that he is trying. \n\nIt took someone who supported him through his tough times, and helped him better himself to get him where he needed to be with both himself and his daughter. We have been married 25 years this year, and have son together, and his daughter is doing great with two kids of her own. \n\nSometimes parents mom/dad both do not tell someone they are dating about their kids right away because they want to fill out the person, before they bring their kids into the picture. From the sounds of your timeline you hadn't been dating long. I know people who dated someone for a year before they brought their children up, because they were protecting their kids. \n\nI honestly wouldn't involve or say anything about my kid if I was single, and starting to date, until I knew the person better. There are just to many weirdos out there now. Better safe than sorry IMO\n\nYou have to decide if this person is worth giving a second chance to or not.",

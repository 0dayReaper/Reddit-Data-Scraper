    "postText": "We matched on a dating app, before the first phone call I asked if he had ever been married or had any children. I like to know what I could be getting myself into, as I am child free and never married. He gave me the answer I wanted to hear, \u201cno children and never married\u201d, right on. We go on a few dates and I\u2019m totally into the guy and can tell he is quite into me as well. We work out together, enjoy nature together and quickly move in with one another. I soon realize he is not only homeless but jobless ( should have been my first red flag) but I do not judge. It\u2019s a struggle for a while but he gains employment and things are rad, like really rad! We both get better paying jobs and move out of the apartment we are paying too much for and find a 3/2 home to rent with a yard, small garage it\u2019s going swimmingly. \n\nBefore moving to the house, my best friend tells me that a friend of a friend of theirs knows my bf and tells my bestie he has a child. I doubt the grape vine information but ask my bf again just to ensure what I already knew. He denies the claim and we continue on with our shared life. \n\nToday I get home and go to check the mail. My bf quit his job so it is imperative that I know how much and when they bills are due to avoid late fees, ect. I\u2019m combing the mail and see a letter address to him, it\u2019s for child support. I bring it in thinking this is a weird mistake or perhaps he is playing a prank. He takes the letter and his whole persona changes. So I ask, \u201cdo you have a child\u201d he smirks and shakes his head, \u201cyeah, she should be about 5 now\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m heartbroken on so many levels and my trust is destroyed. I feel so bad for this little out there missing out on this amazing man. I have been bragging to my friends about what an amazing father he will make when we are ready to start a family. I\u2019m lost on what to do or say. I am total lost. \n\n-BF lied about having a kid for three years and the truth is out, he is a father. How can I move forward with him?",

    "postText": "I (23f) just met my boyfriend\u2019s (33m) kids a few weeks ago. In total, we have been together 7 months. Over these past few weeks, we\u2019ve had sex only a few times. In the past, we were having sex 1-4 times a day easily. Pretty much everyday. Now, we are always quick, even when we don\u2019t need to be! He shares 50/50 custody with the mom, so it\u2019s not like they\u2019re with us/him 24/7. I\u2019ve communicated multiple times now that I\u2019m not okay with our lack of sex. I don\u2019t need sex everyday like we used to. I\u2019d be okay with 2-3 times a week. However, he\u2019s not okay with me using toys on my own so I\u2019m not even getting a compromise. His latest response to that was that we just had sex the other day after I gave him \u201cmediocre head.\u201d Now, not only am I worried about the lack of sex, I\u2019m also feeling like shit about the sex we do have. He said it was just a joke, but I can\u2019t help but wonder if he\u2019s already lost interest in me. I don\u2019t get it, why do people (especially parents) not have sex as much after awhile? It feels too early for this to be happening honestly.\n\nEdit: Please do not message me with negative advice/telling me you\u2019re in the same situation. Use the comments, thanks.",

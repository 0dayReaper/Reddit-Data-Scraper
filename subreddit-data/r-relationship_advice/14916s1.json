    "postText": "It\u2019s all so fresh, I\u2019m deeply hurt and angry, but can\u2019t bring myself to hate him. He\u2019s wanting to fix it, deep down I do too, but the trust is gone (this was the second time). If I were to take my own advice, he would\u2019ve stayed blocked and good riddance bc I deserve someone that loves and respects me enough to not succumb to a \u201cmoment of weakness.\u201dBut as I\u2019m currently going through it, and because I genuinely love and care for him, I\u2019m seriously considering a possible  reconciliation. Definitely not now but maybe in the future. \n\nTo the couples that stayed together after infidelity, How long was your healing journey?\nIs it possible? Is it worth it? Can it even be done?",

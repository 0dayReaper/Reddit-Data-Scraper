    "postText": "Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hjkgnj/update_my_girlfriend_told_me_she_was_with_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nGod this is a doozy. I swear my life feels like a movie right now. Sorry for the weird formatting, I'm on mobile and this is my first time posting on a sub like this. \n\nI (28M) am planning on proposing to my girlfriend of 3 years (26F). Now, I suck at picking out jewelry. Im the type of guy that doesn't see a problem with heart shaped jewelry (seriously why is it considered so ugly?) so every time I want to buy something for my girl, I usually consult one of our mutual friends. My girl's best friends are all friends with me as well and we all get along well, so asking them for help picking out jewelry is something I'm used to. \n\nWhen it came time to pick out a ring, I consulted my girlfriends best friend Justine (fake name). Justine and I are quite close and she knows my girlfriend better than anyone, including me. So, when my girlfriend when out to visit her sister and baby nephew, I invited Justine over to the house to help pick out a ring.\n\nJustine and I looked through a few catalogues, but decided it was a dead end and it would be better to go to professionals at a jewelry store. However, I didn't know when my girlfriend would be coming home, so Justine and I thought of a clever text to gauge how much time we had. I asked her when she'd be coming home, as I was ordering takeout and wanted to know when to tell them to have the food ready by. \n\nShe responded by saying it would be a few hours, she met up with Justine to go shopping. Now, obviously this took me by surprise since Justine was standing inside my house. I showed Justine the text, and she looked as confused as I was. \n\nIt isn't out of the ordinary for my girlfriend to meet up with people out of the blue like that for shopping, lunch, etc. She's a very spontaneous person and loves making plans on the fly. So ordinarily, I would have believed this text in a heartbeat. However, obviously this had to be a lie. \n\nWhen she came home she acted completely normal, and I played along but it's been really hard to act like everything's fine. We got takeout, ate together, and cuddled on the couch after. So far she's caught on a little that somethings upsetting me, but I just can't tell her what. Looking at her kills me. \n\nI don't know what to do. My girlfriend and I have zero trust issues and we tell each other everything, so this lie is killing me. I want to ask her about it so bad, but if I tell her I knew she was lying, I'd have to explain why, and I really don't want to do that. What do I do? I know she lied to me but I don't know how to confront her about it. Should I just forget it? This won't stop gnawing at me. Please help!\n\nEdit: I'm sorry for the lack of responses, it's been a hectic day and there's a lot of comments. Thank you to everyone who has commented so far, I appreciate them all!!\n\nEdit #2: sorry again for the lack of responses, guys. It's really been a crazy day. My parents are moving and I've been helping them. Also, I've never experienced this many comments on a post in my life!! I am going to talk to her tonight once we're both finally settled in after such a busy day, and I will update tomorrow.",

Better to say you hope to get married in general terms and ask the person how they feel about it. Then once you know set up a surprise proposal for a later time. You don\u2019t even need a ring for the proposal. I think rings should be picked out together anyhow because you  want to get an idea of want they like and get their ring size. Especially since you don\u2019t want them to end up like this [here](https://imgur.com/a/D946GNY) Now OP, for confronting them on their lie, trust your gut, if whatever reason they give you doesn\u2019t feel right get out of the relationship now.

If you have discussed them, then she knows marriage is on the table, so the only surprise would have been when, not if, you were planning to propose.\n\nI'd suggest clarifying this lie is a much bigger priority than a minor surprise about when you were going to propose. \n\nAlso, you can simply pass it off as you were planning to get her a gift for (insert birthday, anniversary, arbor day, festivus - whatever) and Justine was helping you pick something - it doesn't have to be an engagement ring.\n\nThat said, before you confront her, you should realize that this could go off the rails very fast. Just be certain you have you ducks lined up in case there is screaming, crying, and you end up making a hasty retreat.\n\nBe careful. Reddit is full of stories that end very badly after someone confronts their partner about a lie. Someone you're about to ask to marry you knows a lot about you and has access to a lot of stuff - bank accounts, social media, email - that could be very damaging in the hands of someone desperate or vengeful or both.",

Who was she with?\n\nIf she gets in your face and insists then you should know that your relationship is in serious trouble. So serious that you then confirm that you were with Justine yesterday. Where were you and why are you lying to me about it?\n\nIf she diverts at all about what were you doing with Justine...then you tell her i was getting her help to picknout and engagement ring for us. But now i'm thinking im an idiot for doing that. \n\nThen get up...ask her to get her story straight and leave until she comes clean.\n\nWarning...she may try to make it some kind of surprise for you...trust but verify.\n\nIf shes cheating then you have matrixed yourself out of a bullet.",

So prepare for her to have perfect reasons.\n\nThe longer you wait, the worse it's gonna be for you in terms of finding out the truth. I really hope this wasnt a week ago.\n\nSit her down and ask her what she bought that day with Justine. Where did they go. Etc. I think most likely she'll say something like \"oh oops I didn't mean Justine, I was with X\". But maybe not and she'll go deeper into the lie. \n\nYou keep concerning yourself with \"but then it'll ruin the surprise!\", yet fail to comprehend how likely it is to be a moot point; and even if she is innocent of infidelity, she still lied. At this point engagement HAS to be shelved until you get this completely straightened out. \n\nYou can say you consulted Justine to buy GF a bathing suit  for [birthday/ anniversary/ spontaneous gift] &amp; summer.  And she was over. Who cares what you say, you're not the guilty one. \n\nIf she changes her story, I'd strongly, STRONGLY consider demanding her phone to look through. You can insist you're not that kinda guy, but its WAY better to do that 1x than willingly get into a marriage with somebody cheating before you even propose. You will never EVER forgive yourself if you look past this, get married, have kids, and find out shes been fucking other dudes behind your back this entire time.",

When I got to the house, my best friend\u2019s car was in the driveway. I looked at my phone to see if she was looking to meet up with me and saw that my BF had sent me a message trying to figure out when I would get home, using this obvious lie about ordering food (he didn\u2019t even ask if I was planning to eat while I was out or what I would want). I was crushed and angry, so I replied and told him I was with the friend that he was clearly hooking up with just to freak him out. And guess what, it worked. He confronted me thinking he caught me in a lie. When I told him that I knew she was there, he made up this stupid story saying that she was helping him pick out a gift for me. But he has a \u201ctell\u201d when he is lying and I called him out on it. You won\u2019t believe it, but he doubled down and said the \u201cgift\u201d was an engagement ring. I stormed out, but after crying all night I thought, is it possible he was actually telling the truth? I would feel like the worst person in the world if that was actually what was going on.\u201d\n\nEveryone would say he\u2019s gas lighting her and she should trust her gut.\n\nThis is a young couple on the verge of getting engaged. I think it\u2019s well within reason that they were both engaging in romantic deception. Or she was cheating. Or he was cheating and knows she\u2019ll check his Reddit posts and think it\u2019s the actual true story.",

    "postText": "My (19m) girlfriend (19f) was on a girls trip with her friends and they were playing a drinking game at her friends house. My girlfriend got a card that said kiss someone one or take 4 shots. She chose to kiss her college roommate, and told me after as if it was no big deal. She told me it was just a peck. She expected me to think it was hot but was surprised when I told her I didn't like it. I said it was no big deal In the moment, and brushed it off. As time went on I can't stop thinking about it and it upsets me. I've lost sleep over this, and I feel disrespected. Is this cheating or not? It makes me upset that she did something without talking to me first.",

If OP\u2019s gf is straight, then kissing another girl, especially just a peck, and especially as part if a game, would not be considered cheating by many people. It depends on the people and the relationship to determine what would be considered cheating for them. It sounds like OP and his gf had different ideas of what is and is not okay. OP needs to decide if he can get past this, and if so, he needs to have a conversation with his girlfriend to make sure they are both on the same page. This is a no fault situation.",

It can be as platonic as kissing someone on the cheek. \n\nIt's different to peck someone who is a good friend of yours and whom you're comfortable enough with, during a card game, and kiss someone because you genuinely want to kiss them or because you're horny or feel lonely or whatever.",

Even if she just didn't want to drink she still could have just done neither, it's not like she was being held at gunpoint and if the other people had a problem with it then they can go fuck themselves.\n\nI'm not saying she actually thought it would be a big deal or that this guy should even worry about it that much but excuses are just excuses.",

There was no nefarious intent, she just didn\u2019t want to get alcohol poisoning or seem lame by doing neither, and she told you about it right away. Even if it does cross a line, personally it\u2019s something I would absolutely try to work through and forgive for the right person. Maybe make sure it\u2019s a boundary that doesn\u2019t get crossed again, but then let it go. It\u2019s not like she was drunk making out with another girl just because she was attracted and horny. \n\nHaving said that, if you feel betrayed and like the trust is broken, that\u2019s valid too. You\u2019d be justified for breaking up over it.",

I do find the dismissal of your feelings and the lack of respect for your position over it deeply disturbing and disrespectful. The fact that she just brushed it off is the problem here, not the kiss itself. Honestly I bet you wouldn't still be having a problem with it if when you told her you didn't like it she would have said something like, \"okay I didn't know it would be a problem. I'm sorry and it will never happen again.\" Maybe you'd still think about it in a negative way, but it wouldn't be weighing on you like this. It isn't the act. It is the fact that instead of considering your feelings with any ounce of real respect, she has instead let you know your feelings in this matter do not matter to her in the least that is the problem. She needs to be aware of this fissure in your relationship before you take anything any further.",

            "comment": "I've started to feel like this is a generational thing almost. I was born in 90 and I feel like a lot of men my age were really raised on this sexualized male gaze framing of lesbianism, I feel like in some ways my thinking this kind of thing is hot and not being threatened by it is 1 part not being a jealous guy in the first place and 1 part a homophobic inability to take seriously the idea that another woman could really threaten the emotional side of my relationship with my gf. Reinforcing this was the straight girls in high school and college who made out with other girls mostly as a drunk sexy thing to turn on the men hanging out.\n\nThen Gen Z men take the potential for a same sex person to steal their partner much more seriously in part because they are less homophobic than millennials. Also Gen Z just drinks less and has less sex in general, and seem less sort of free spirited than we were. If I were OP's age I'm certain my mind would've gone straight to trying to angle for a 3 way with my gfs friend, with a side of just feeling cool for having a hot partying girlfriend who did this kind of thing, I don't think I'd have even thought about it jeopardizing my relationship.\n\nI'd like to think I'm an ally and really take seriously bisexuality and same sex attraction and that my perspective is informed mostly by not being jealous or insecure that my gf would ever leave me for anyone, but if that were really true I should feel more or less the same about both genders and I don't. for her to hook up with a man I'd need a full on open relationship to feel comfortable, whereas her hooking up with a woman doesn't feel like it'd require our relationship model to change it'd kind of just be hot. So I don't know quite how to untangle whether this is just the culture I was raised or I'm like some kind of bigot for this. I support my LGBTQ friends and their rights in every way I can, but do I need to feel threatened by women who are into my gf to truly be an ally if I'm currently more threatened by men who are into my gf? Is this somehow a lack of real respect for bi or lesbian women that I'm displaying?\n\ncomplicating matters is I do feel like a woman could give my gf something I couldn't and so it's less of a direct potential replacement of me somehow than  a man would be, but I wonder if that is homophobic or sexist too? After all women have great sex with eachother and fall in love, so why wouldn't I think that'd be a direct replacement for my love and my sex?\n\nHonestly feel bad about myself when I think this through, but also my feelings and desires are my feelings and desires, you know? I don't really know that I would be able to or even would want to change this since in the end I am very secure in my relationship and I would find her hooking up with a girl hot in a way that I wouldn't if she were hooking up with a guy. I don't know how to make myself feel any different, whether that's threatened by her making out with a woman or turned on by her making out with a man, I just can't feel either way if I'm honest with my emotional reactions. Is that fucked up? am I homophobic?",

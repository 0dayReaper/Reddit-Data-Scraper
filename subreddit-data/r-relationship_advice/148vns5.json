    "postText": "I have always struggled to speak up and stand up for myself. My wife has essentially walked all over me for our 9 year marriage. She is verbally abusive, manipulative, calls me every horrible thing imaginable, disrespects me in front of my friends family, her friends etc , has gotten physically violent with me and has even gotten violent with my dog and has whooped her. \n\nShe has many strained relationships in her life, including with her parents and many of her friends don\u2019t talk to her anymore because they think she\u2019s mean. \n\nShe has made new friends at the gym she goes to, but is already having drama with them. I don\u2019t see these friendships lasting. \n\nShe refuses to see any wrong that she\u2019s ever done and blames all her marital problems on me.\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly one-sided, and I\u2019ve gotten completely numb to it\n\nWhen we got married, she was not a legal resident of the US. She was able to obtain a green card through our marriage. \n\nAnother factor is that her parents lost their apartment seven years ago and had to move in with us in our tiny little ranch home. \n\nAlso she barely works- and puts zero effort into landing a job. So I kind of feel like if I leave her, she\u2019s screwed.\n\nI\u2019ve also struggled with erectile dysfunction throughout our marriage, partly physical health related, as I once weighed 320 pounds and had a plethora of health issues, but probably because of the emotional abuse I\u2019ve had to deal with. She also has PCOS so having children has not happened and would be difficult. I\u2019ve recently lost a ton of weight and am overcoming my ED issues.\n\nI do feel like I\u2019ve done an awful lot for her. \n\nLately, she\u2019s been talking about divorce and how she doesn\u2019t know if she wants to be with me anymore and all this crap. And then to top it off, she said she might be attracted to women. In my head, I know I should leave or kick her out. But my heart has grown numb to the situation and I feel stuck. Do you think I should leave her, or should I kick her out? What would you do in this situation?",

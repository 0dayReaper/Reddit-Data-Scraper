    "postText": "at the start of this March, an old high school acquaintance reached out to me. We began talking &amp; really hit it off, our chemistry was undeniable. Our first date was *lovely*, it couldn\u2019t have gone any better than that. \n\nWe started hanging out as frequently as possible, and he made the effort to do so despite his busy schedule as a firefighter paramedic. Something felt so right about him, he was determined to show me what real love is supposed to feel like since I\u2019d been in abusive relationships in my past. He was so receptive to my emotions, he loved me gently, he was incredibly respectful, and cheered for me to become the best version of myself. \n\nThis man was everything my heart ever needed, I can\u2019t express how safe and secure he made me feel. He was so excited to introduce me to his family, friends, and coworkers. The green flags were all there, and I had no reason to ever doubt that there\u2019d be a day where he\u2019d no longer be mine. It never once crossed my mind. He\u2019d made it clear at the beginning that all he wanted at this point in his life was to settle down with someone. We both had a history of awfully toxic and upsetting relationships in the past, and it felt like we both knew that was something we\u2019d never have to worry about again.\n\nAt the 1.5 month mark, I noticed subtle changes in his behavior. It seemed like I was falling down the list of priorities during his free time. At this point I was only seeing him once a week (twice if I was lucky). I would\u2019ve dropped anything to see him, so I couldn\u2019t help but be a little hurt when he\u2019d rather go out with his friends or go do things alone when I was dying to spend quality time together. I offered him all of my understanding and was just simply grateful to see him whenever possible.\n\n I ended up bringing it up to him and let him know how I felt, he reassured me he was just dealing with a bit of burnout from work and told me he\u2019d make it up to me because we had all the time in the future to do so. I thought that was understandable considering his 24 hour on &amp; 48 hour off work schedule (I knew that had to be weighing heavily on him). He goes to the gym for 3 hours on every off day since it helps with his mental health (which isn\u2019t something I\u2019d expect him to sacrifice). \n\nAbout 2 weeks ago, he brought me to a party with his coworkers to meet everyone. It felt amazing to be included in that part of his life so soon. We spent the night together that night and planned to spend the night again the next day. He left to go to the gym and I received a text from him saying \u201cPlease don\u2019t take this personally, but could you not spend the night tonight? I just need some time alone that I haven\u2019t had in a while\u201d. I was initially worried thinking it was maybe something I said to trigger it, but he assured me he just needs alone time every once in a while to stay sane. \n\nSince then, we went on a date and hung out a few times. Everything was going really well but I could tell he just wasn\u2019t completely himself, he seemed exhausted and less talkative. About 6 days ago, I received the dreaded \u201cI think we need to talk about us text\u201d which *completely* blindsided me. He came over to my house to talk, *here\u2019s a summary of what was said:*\n\n\n\u2022 \u201dI have tons of feelings for you but it doesn\u2019t seem equal to what you give &amp; feel and all I feel is guilt over it all\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201dI know you noticed a change and I feel SO terrible about it but I\u2019ve been trying my best to reciprocate and it seems that it only leaves you anxious. I understand it completely and I know I\u2019m not giving you what you deserve\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201dI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m capable for a relationship right now, I feel like I\u2019m leaving you wanting more and as deeply as I care about you and appreciate you my mind and body just doesn\u2019t have it in me to give you 100% right now\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201dHow can I reciprocate love in a relationship when all I want is to be alone?? Relationships just aren\u2019t my thing, I\u2019m sorry\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014I was speechless and heartbroken, how could he pursue a relationship and do everything right just to randomly end things because relationships suddenly aren\u2019t his thing and he wants to spend the rest of his life alone?? We haven\u2019t talked since then, and I\u2019m terrified I\u2019ll never hear from him again. He said he needed to work on himself but refuses to go to therapy. I KNOW he\u2019s dealing with depression and it just hurts that I can\u2019t do anything to help him. He suddenly pushed me away once his bottled up feelings became too much to handle. I just wanted to be that safe space for him, but he self sabotaged our connection and claims all he wants is to be alone. I\u2019m so worried about him, it\u2019s as if a switch flipped &amp; something dark possessed him \n\n***Do I give him his space and wait for him to reach out? I don\u2019t want him going through it alone, but I can\u2019t help but think he has avoidant attachment issues stemming from childhood trauma as an only child. He\u2019s so used to being hyper independent, so i don\u2019t know what to do :(",

It wasn\u2019t exactly sudden either, you described how his behaviour changed. It\u2019s an amazing quality to be so caring and generous, but just remember to take things slow next time.

Also, I know it sounds like things went fast but it felt very natural.

To do so, he goes all out, is thoughtful, attentive yada yada. But that isn\u2019t how he truly feels, it\u2019s a mask he puts on. \n\nSo once you\u2019 go all in/he has won by winning you, the self doubt kicks in. He thinks he has to keep showing you the perfect version of himself, because you could never love the flawed man within. So what happens? \n\nIt gets too much for him. True, honest intimacy would require him to open up to you and he can\u2019t. So it\u2019s easier to get distance in, reply less. Avoidant attachers always think they have to please the other person to be loved and that friction of being that perfect version and putting your needs before their own always leads to resentment/stress because at some point they just can\u2019t keep up the facade anymore. \n\nHope that gives you an insight into his mechanism. But more importantly, what does this mean for you? Please realise that you did nothing wrong. Don\u2019t try to keep in touch because what will likely happen is that now, where he has established the distance he needs to feel secure, there\u2019s space for his desire to be loved again. Which means it\u2019s highly likely he\u2019ll reach out, string you along with vague hopeful promises without ever committing fully. Not the rollercoaster you deserve. My advice, just cut contact and don\u2019t wonder if you could have done something to make it work. You can\u2019t. It\u2019s his broken mechanism and unless he realises that and actively chooses to work on it for himself, you\u2019d be fighting a loosing battle.",

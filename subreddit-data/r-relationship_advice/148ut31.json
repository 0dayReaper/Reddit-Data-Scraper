    "postText": "My girlfriend of over a year just admitted to me that she recently called her \u201cemotionally abusive\u201d ex-boyfriend on the phone and had a long conversation with him about the past and catching up. She knows this hurts me but doesn\u2019t seem to care. She talks about him all the time, usually negatively, but also sometimes fondly. She acts like it\u2019s normal, even though I\u2019ve told her it bothers me. It makes me feel like she\u2019s still attached to him. It makes me feel sick to my stomach and I wanna know if I\u2019m over reacting or being insecure. Just wanted to hear other people\u2019s opinions and advice on how to handle this.",

Is that the kind of person you want to be with long term? Don't get lost in the fantasy that she will change or you can fix her. Either accept her as she is (and her ongoing relationship with her ex) or move on.",

            "comment": "  \n\r  \nIn this situation, communication is key. It's crucial to have an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about your feelings. Let her know how her actions are affecting you, using \"I\" statements to avoid sounding accusatory. For example, you could say something like, \"I feel hurt when you talk about your ex-boyfriend and have conversations with him.\"\r  \n\r  \nDiscuss and agree on boundaries that both of you are comfortable with regarding contact with ex-partners. This could involve limiting or avoiding discussions about past relationships or agreeing not to maintain regular contact with exes. Finding a compromise that respects both of your needs and concerns is crucial for the health of your relationship.\r  \n\r  \nAsk what your girlfriend might be trying to accomplish by reaching out to her ex. Understanding her motivations can provide valuable insights into the situation. It's possible that she may have unresolved emotions or unfinished business with her ex-boyfriend. By talking to him, she might be seeking closure or trying to make sense of past experiences. However, it's crucial to remember that this doesn't excuse any potential disregard for your feelings. It's important to communicate and express your concerns, so you can both work towards a resolution that respects your relationship and provides a healthier emotional environment.",

She\u2019ll say she loves how strong and \u201cmanly\u201d I am, but will say she wishes I joked around more then talk about how hilarious her ex was. Shit HURTS. She\u2019s also said she wishes I was more sensitive and \u201cpoetic\u201d like her ex was\u2026\nShe\u2019s usually really good to me, it\u2019s just this one aspect that really brings me down.",

Seriously, communication is key, but if it's not working after all this time, it's probably a sign that things won't get better.\r  \n\r  \nIn a healthy relationship, both people should lift each other up, not bring each other down. You deserve someone who appreciates you for who you are and doesn't constantly wish you were someone else. It's important to prioritize your own happiness and mental well-being.\r  \n\r  \nBreaking up is tough, no doubt about it. But staying in a relationship that constantly makes you feel down and insecure is even tougher. Talk to your friends or someone you trust about what you're going through. Sometimes getting some outside perspective can help you make the right decision for yourself. Remember, you deserve to be with someone who loves and respects you just the way you are.",

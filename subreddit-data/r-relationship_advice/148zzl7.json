    "postText": "My partner and I go on the best dates. He always makes sure he gives me the best dates and the best time. For some reason I feel like I can\u2019t be myself around him though. I can\u2019t talk to him about certain things, for example for some reason he doesn\u2019t like my family members so he shuts down when I mention them, or I mention any man (ex girlfriends bf) in a convo he shuts down and goes silent. \n\nHe started this new thing where he goes silent or gets a angry if I say no to doing sexual stuff. I say no mostly bcuz I don\u2019t want to do anything in public and we lost our place recently. He says I don\u2019t have empathy for his desires and the struggle that comes with it and gets mad at me. I genuinely believe that I give him so much empathy and I don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s not enough. He says that anything can be worked through, but I\u2019m not sure if this is something I want to work through bcuz I don\u2019t feel like anyone should feel entitled to sexual affection to the point where they give silent treatment or get angry. He blames me for giving up on the relationship when he would do \u201cwhatever it takes to be with me.\u201d I\u2019m not sure if this behavior is normal or if this is something I should work on with him. What do y\u2019all think?\n\nP.S: This has been a reoccurring issue and everytime it happens I leave. I just feel very guilty for leaving permanently this time when the guy I know genuinely feels like I\u2019m the one. He is perfect to me in some ways but in these things we just don\u2019t see eye to eye",

Secondly, his sexual needs do not override your autonomy.  He is not entitled to it because he happens to be your boyfriend nor do you have to be emphatic towards his sexual wants.\n\nHe isn't going to die, he isn't going to be unwell, he like just about all healthy adults can actually wait until appropriate times and places without coercing his partner.\n\nBlock, delete, cut all contact \n\nHe would do anything to be with you except respect you",

I lived through it with my ex and it\u2019s hard to see from the inside but once your out and you have clarity, you will look back at yourself and forever ask \u201cwhat the actual fuck\u201d. \n\nYou should never feel pressured or manipulated into sexual situations. People who say \u201cif you loved me you\u2019d\u2026\u201d or in his case \u201cyou don\u2019t have sympathy for my desires and the struggles that come with it so/because\u2026\u201d are manipulating you. He is not showing you love. He\u2019s showing you that getting his dick wet is more important than your feelings (sorry to be so blunt). \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to avoid even talking about your family (or other dudes but let\u2019s focus on family here). This is the beginning of isolation. Unless your family is full of Dahmers, Mansons, Jareds from Subway, if they abuse you or they have actually done something awful to him specifically, he has no reason to hold such hostility towards them. My guess is he thinks they do or will see through his bullshit and encourage you to get out. \n\nAnd he\u2019s already proving he won\u2019t do \u201cwhatever it takes to be with you\u201d because he won\u2019t talk about your family and tries to guilt or pressure you into sex.\n\nBeing perfect to you in some ways may just be the love-bombing in disguise. \n\nOP, this will not get better. I\u2019m not going to tell you what to do, but I hope you open your eyes and get out before you really are too far in.\n\nEdit: spelling and add a forgotten word",

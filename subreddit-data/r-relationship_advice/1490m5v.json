    "postText": "My bf is still friends with his old friend with benefits. He still keeps her around his circle bc he cares about her like family but now that we've started dating idk if I feel comfortable with the situation. I\u2019m scared to create a  boundary because he knows me to be super cool about things like this. Their friendship does make me uncomfortable but I also don't want him to lose her as a friend and someone he sees as family. How do I try move past it and or get over it? I do trust him but Idk how to get over the fact that I have to hang around with someone that has seen my partner naked. They both have made it clear that they are just friends and nothing more. He says he never saw her as more than that but there is still fear of something.",

You can't force him to give her up....even with an ultimatum because that'll just lead to resentment from him and then everyone will hate you because the girl's family will ask why your bf doesn't come around anymore and then she'll tell then it was your fault...just like she's gonna tell all their mutuals. It's not worth the fucking headache, trust me. I learned this as I got older, but stay away from dudes who have \"girl best friends\" that cross boundaries or exes that cross boundaries. The scenarios almost never work out in your favor and it's more pain/drama than it is worth.",

    "postText": "Original post\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hqhhan/i_walked_in_on_my_son_haveng_sex_with_my_brothers/?utm_source=reddit-android\n\nOn mobile \n\nI first want to thank everyone for all the advice I got from my original post, im sorry for not replying to any comments, (I think I only replied to one comment) my head was all over the place. I'll try to keep this update short.\n\nAs was suggested by many of the comments I decided to tell my husband first and proceed from there, my husband lost it(he first thaught it was a joke). We talked about the issue and we decided we should first talk to our son before telling my brother.\n\nWe confronted our son with what I saw, he already knew what was going on as he saw my reddit post and put 2 and 2 together, he didn't deny anything he confessed, he told us him and SIL have been having sex since February last year( he was 17 at the time). My son said it started on SIL's birthday  party he attended they got drunk and had sex in a bathroom and they have been meeting at hotels ever since and sneaking off at family gatherings.\n\nAfter my son's confession my husband just lost it and told my son to leave the house and go and to our condo in town as he didn't want to see him in front of him at this moment. When my son was gone my husband stormed into my brother's room and told my brother everything( SIL was not in the house at that moment).\n\nMy brother lost it and packed his stuff took the kids and left, he asked where my son had gone he said he wanted to teach him lesson, we didn't tell him and he eventually left. SIL didn't return I think my brother might have called her or my son warned her and she is afraid to come back(her things are still in the house).\n\nIn all the screaming and shouting my daughter's heard everything and are devastated that their family might be ruined they miss their brother and are afraid my husband won't ever let him in the house again.( my husband hates all forms of infidelity to the core and has always drilled this in our 2 eldest children that they must never cheat on anyone or be in a relationship with someone in a relationship)\n\n I know I did nothing wrong in this but how will I ever look my brother in the eye again, he won't answer and calls or text my husband said i should give him time to heal. My son has left the condo because he is afraid of what my brother will do to him and is now hiding at a friend's and he won't tell us which friend. No word on SIL.\n\nINFO: SIL was the one who initiated sex the first time my son and her slept together, she was the one booking hotel rooms, buying my son dinners and lunches, my son was even receiving an allowance from her.",

But obviously he could just be worried about someone finding out where he is, and coming to beat his ass. But ultimately, your bil biggest issue should be with his wife. She took advantage of a teenager and kept it up for so long.",

Authorities in most places still do not take kindly to adults having relationships with adults double their age. It is still considered grooming and they will take action if you notify them, especially since the SIL has children still technically under her care. Having a police report filed against her or an open CPS case will make it easier for the Brother to file for custody if he considers a divorce. \n\nDo not let the age of your son discourage you from pressing charges. She took advantage of him while he was drunk. It is sexual assault and should be handled as such.",

She groomed a 17 year-old who was still growing and trying to find himself. No one should offer sex to a teen. The money she offered him could very well be her way of convincing him to continue the aftair. Her authority as an elder could have made it harder for your son to reject at first too. \n\nDo not let this cycle repeat. Please contact authorities such as the police or CPS. Do not neglect your mental health. Please see a professional so you can completely come to terms with what you witnessed. Talking to someone about this can really relieve stress and give you a new un-biased perspective on what happened and what you should do. Focus on giving your family the help and support they need, but don\u2019t neglect yourself!\n\nSource: Was 17 and groomed by the father of my child. I am just giving tips on what helped me in a somewhat similar situation.",

A woman twice his age and married with kids slept with op's barely legal son and repeatedly cheated on her husband in doing so, but everyone is mad at the son.\n\nAt the very least, she took advantage of his immaturity and established a financial reliance on her which adds a unbalanced power dynamic ontop of the inherent one that comes from their different stages in life. I understand why everyone is having a knee jerk reaction, and why op's brother is especially mad (not excusing his violent desires but I understand why he's feeling them) but the SIL is the true 'villain' here.",

First, if you're 16 there is a 5 to 7 year restriction.  So that means the oldest your partner could be is 21 to 23 years old.  This is to provide legal protection to teenagers who may have an older bf/gf.  Like you're 15 you start dating a 17 year old, but suddenly next year it's illegal?  That's the intent of AOC, it doesn't allow teenagers to be sexually active with adults twice their age.\n\nSecond, there are restrictions in place regarding people in authority over a teenager.  So that could be a teacher, coach, trainer, boss, or relative (to name a few).  So the SIL would be violating AOC laws two fold",

In most states AOC is firm for any age difference, and only positions of authority are illegal. Romeo and Juliet laws only apply for people under the AOC if the person they are with is over the AOC but the age gap is small enough that they likely were school mates and is very common and understandable situation. AOC is exactly that, the age at which you can consent and after which statutory rape no longer exists. \n\nI don\u2019t see anywhere where OP says which state they are in and the firm AOC is 16 in most US states so in most cases this is untrue. Your confusing Romeo and Juliet laws with what AOC means legally. When you reach AOC you are legally considered to understand sexual encounters and are able to consent to sex with any other adult regardless of age difference. Yes such an age difference is taboo, but it is what it is and your comment is incorrect in almost every state in the US, very few states have a restriction on age difference when one party is between the AOC(assuming it\u2019s under 18) and 18, I\u2019m not up to date on the law everywhere but what you are referencing are like I\u2019ve said Romeo and Juliet laws which isn\u2019t applicable here.\n\nEdit: as others have pointed out the law your referencing exists to protect the older party in statutory rape cases not the younger and really is only there to protect some 17/18 year old from sleeping with their 15/16 YO partner. Your mistaken in the use of this law and its applicability. There isn\u2019t any restrictions on AOC between 16-18, if there are then the AOC is actually 18 with Romeo and Juliet laws protecting the person of AOC from statutory cases against the person under AOC not vice versa like in this case.",

She is a grown ass woman who was fucking and grooming a CHILD. he was 17. I don't give a fuck if your man child husband haaaates infidelity. Most of us do! But she is a grown ass woman in her 30s who holds most of this bag. SHE is the one who is married. SHE is the one who had kids and a family to think about. SHE made the choice to statutorily rape a minor. 17 and 18 year old kids aren't known for making thorough intelligent adult decisions. \n\nYou need to tell your brother to back the fuck off your son and worry about his pedophile wife. In fact, you should probably make sure they aren't together. Maybe be a parent and protect your child from a fucking predator and a hillbilly moron. Hell, why aren't you looking for your SIL to teach HER a lesson? \n\nIf the genders were reversed, no one would be calling for girls head at 18. This is no different.\n\nEdit- wow, thanks for the awards!! I\u2019m glad most people would feel the same!",

He told me it was nice because they were both lonely and helped each other out. Meanwhile when he\u2019s telling me this my skin was crawling. He was in his 20s, I was in my 30s, and he dated women generally 20 years his senior- we didn\u2019t work out. He was an alcoholic, when he didn\u2019t drink a six pack a night he screamed bloody murder in his sleep. When he drank the beer he sweat the bed so thoroughly the blankets didn\u2019t dry till the next morning. He ate all my pain pills and would consume any intoxicant around. After months of dating I told him to get help for his sleeping or we couldn\u2019t sleep in the same bed any more, and he ghosted me. He also had a hard time taking no in bed, which I\u2019m wondering is what he learned from these women. It was so toxic. Men I\u2019ve talked to seem to think being with a hot older woman is a badge of honor, but I\u2019d say not when it\u2019s under the guise of a legit relationship and it\u2019s the Only relationship a kid is having.",

She took advantage, as a fully grown adult. I understand your shock, but it was extremely shitty of your husband to react like this.",

If you can find an excuse to get him to meet you (JUST you) in person (returning laptop left behind, giving him some cash, anything), use that as an opportunity to get him to meet you and have a conversation in private. It looks like you never had the chance to do that, just you and him. Personally, I share your husband's stance on infidelity, and I understand his anger; his son has turned 18 and he wanted to belive that he had raised a moral, upstanding man. A lot of people are looking at it as your husband *blaming* your son, but I think it's just disappointment in the form of anger. \n\nI do believe your son should have been able to make better decisions, but based on the *way* this played out (hlstarting when he was 17, possibly younger, approaching him at a family event where he is at ease and she has authority as an \"adult\", buying him dinners and giving him money), this was TEXTBOOK grooming. Did your son screw up? Yes, absolutely, but he can be punished or grounded LATER. Right now the PRIORITY has to be getting him away from this woman. She is 100% a PREDATOR. \n\nSit down with your husband and explain this to him, tell him you understand his frustration and that the two of you will punish your son accordingly, but for now the BIGGER risk is losing him forever. The longer he stays in her clutches, the deeper the manipulation where she can make him believe that's its \"them against the world\" or that you all \"just don't understand their love\". That kind of bullshit will be eaten up by a young boy in puppy love. \n\nYou need to bring your son back into the fold and convince him that she preyed on and manipulated him. You CANNOT allow her to be the only one who shows him concern or affection right now. You just can't. Please tell your husband this. If possible (I'm not sure if you want to involve them), sit him down with the whole family, along with your daughters, and plead with him to bring your boy back, remind him that he can still be angry tomorrow, but he may have lost his son to this predator by then. This woman ALREADY turned your son against one part of his own family, DO NOT let her finish the job.",

This makes the grooming comments somewhat more plausible to me.",

The fact that he's older now doesn't change the fact that this probably start many years ago. Predators gain control when people are younger and more vulnerable and keep control even after they get older (and when people think they should know better).\n* You and especially your husband really need to rethink whether your son isn't as much a victim of your scumbag SIL as your brother.\n* Your teenage son has just lost his parents and his entire support network. You've abandoned him to navigate a situation that YOU had difficulty with.\n* People are guessing he's with your SIL since none of his friends knows where he is. You've abandoned him with little money, few resources, no support - and the ONLY person who is even pretending to care about him is the disgusting predator who caused all of this.\n* Your son may not even realize he's a victim. He may actually foolishly think he's in love with her.\n* ETA: Your son is hiding from you and your husband because he's scared of you and doesn't feel safe with you or your husband. Let me repeat that. Your son is SCARED of YOU.\n\nAnd really, does your brother actually think your son is the ONLY guy his wife has been having sex with? How delusional would that be. Your son is probably just the most recent in a long line of guys (and perhaps other teens) that your SIL has banged.\n\nYou and your husband need to get off your self-righteous high horses and be parents. Sometimes children make bad life choices. And sometimes, you need to make tough choices with them AFTER trying your best.\n\nBut seriously, you and your husband haven't even really tried to be decent parents, just indignant scolds and fair weather parents who only support their son when he doesn't cause trouble.\n\nI hope you son is safe.\n\nedit: typos",

A 17 year old being pursued by his 34 year old aunt is not an affair. It's grooming and maybe even something she could be charged for. You and your husband should be 1) trying to find your son and help him through this terrible situation and 2) contacting a lawyer.",

It takes some time to separate emotions and sex. If SIL took him on fancy dinners and stuff, this was very very carefully planned. Try and explain this to your husband and if possible contact your son and tell him that you care about him. He has done a wrong thing, and yet the blame isn't entirely his.",

You two need to wrap your heads around the fact that she is sexually abusing your child. He needs love, help and understanding. He does not need anger and resentment from you guys. Your brother needs to understand that his wife is sexually abusing her nephew. The only person who needs to be taught a lesson is the POS who is sexually abusing your son. Your brother should absolutely file for sole custody of their kids. She is a sexual predator and shouldn\u2019t be around children...hers included. You and your husband should absolutely go to the police and see what, if anything, can be done legally at this point. Your son is not a disappointment. He is someone who has been traumatized and will need help processing what has been done to him. Your son is not a \u201ccheater\u201d the narrative here needs to change.

Your SIL has control over a sad and scared kid who has now just been alienated from his family. She\u2019s going to be desperate to keep that control. Especially now that she has no family either. Also, if you push for that paternity test, what\u2019s going to stop your brother from hurting his own kids. There are many ways this could end, at the very least, your son will have trauma. At worst, someone could be killed. I know this isn\u2019t what you want to hear, but you need to step the fuck up. \n\nFind your fucking kid who is living with a sexual predator. Your son already is going to have trauma. Don\u2019t traumatize him further and don\u2019t ALLOW him to be traumatized further. Find your kid. Tell him you love him. Make your husband apologize for practically pushing your son into a predator\u2019s hands and said \u201chere. take him.\u201d",

Keep your brother the fuck away from him. Yeah, he should have known better. But she literally seduced a child. She is the one carrying the blame here for the most part. SHE was the married woman. SHE was a grown ass adult. SHE had the children.\n\nMy fucking God. I hope this is fake. Otherwise get your fucking shit together.",

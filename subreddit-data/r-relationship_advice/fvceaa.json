    "postText": "There is currently this trend on the tiktok app of girls surprising their man by walking into the room naked, and filming their reaction. I've seen these videos before and normally the reaction is the man gets a smile on his face and they obviously get it on.  It's cheesy, romantic, funny, whatever.\n\nMy girlfriend is working from home during the pandemic and I work in the hospital. I got home from a 12 hour shift of potentially being exposed to covid-19, and just wanted some beers and to go to bed. I guess my girlfriend thought she would get the same reaction when i walked in the door and saw her naked. \n\nI barely had enough energy left to give any reaction let alone a good one. I basically just told her i appreciated the gesture but i was exhausted. She got moody at me basically comparing all these other tiktoks where the man gets excited to see their girl naked. I told her all these tiktoks have men working from home, not walking in the door after a 12 hour shift in a hospital during a pandemic. She then took this as an insult at the fact that she's currently working from home, when this wasn't my intention at all.\n\nSince this happened a couple of days ago, she's acting like i don't find her sexy at all and giving my sarcastic answers. What do I even say to her?",

She\u2019s comparing herself, you, and your relationship to others. \n\nA lot of TikTok videos are fake too so that\u2019s not wise. \n\nLike others have said it sounds like she\u2019s very insecure and Instagram, tiktok, snapchat ect. Are not the best place to hangout if you have self esteem issues. They will compound your insecurities ten fold.",

People don\u2019t post the negative sides to their relationship; you don\u2019t see those girls doing this \u201cchallenge\u201d and posting videos of themselves being ignored by their boyfriends playing video games.  And unfortunately, it\u2019s not realistic to expect your significant other to always respond how you want them to.\n\nIt\u2019d be hard to appreciate the good if that\u2019s all we see.  And if we only EXPECT good things, then that\u2019s just getting set up to be let down.",

She said something that I view as pretty thoughtless and mean about my job.\n\nBut. It isn't the time. She's going through an incredibly stressful time and then experienced something even more traumatic just hours before.\n\nGiven how uncharacteristic it was and the situation, I decided to let sleeping dogs lie. I'm glad I did and that instead I was there for my partner during a horrible time for her.\n\nAnd guess what? Today she called me (we don't live together) to say that particular line had been bugging her for a few days. She apologised for it, said she didn't agree with it, and didn't know where it came from.\n\nI'm not advocating for being a doormat or ignoring all issues, but essential workers are going through a once in a lifetime event at the moment - maybe think about the big picture. Some stuff might not be ideal right now, but the external pressure they're facing is incredible. They'll come back and the qualities you love will shine through when they aren't being put through the ringer.",

They don't even have  a n y  idea how much of their personal info is being tracked on a literal daily basis.

Because same as you, he has to do his whole shower, decontamination process and is probably starving and exhausted. Even before covid, this was a thing. \n\nI think there\u2019s a middle ground here where you let her know you certainly didn\u2019t mean to make her feel rejected and that you think she\u2019s beautiful, but she has to \u201cread the room\u201d and realize that when you get home from work you\u2019re not going to have the ideal enthusiasm that she\u2019s obviously looking for. She needs to learn to cut you a little slack and realize you\u2019re not an object that needs to give her attention whenever she feels it\u2019s the right time without any thought to how you feel. I think you guys can have a respectful conversation that provides some reassurance but also lets her know she needs to adjust her expectations a little bit because you\u2019re only human.\n\nWishing you luck and thanking you for everything you\u2019re doing, seriously. Take care of yourself.\n\nEdit to add - I think it\u2019s also okay to let her know it\u2019s okay for her to feel rejected, but it\u2019s what she does with those feelings that matter. The second you tell her you appreciate the gesture but you\u2019re exhausted, she needs to learn to have a little bit of empathy and let that guide her reaction other than her knee jerk insecure habits. Sometimes if a person is feeling insecure they take every little innocuous action from their partner as a sign that the belief they have about themselves (that they\u2019re not good enough) is true.",

Even before this pandemic, you walk into isolation rooms for cdiff, MRSA, flu, noro, you get your clothes or body *grabbed* by people who have bm under their fingernails because they manually disimpacted themselves five minutes ago, or with blood because they pick at their skin, or with who knows what because they keep itching their crotch, and you don't want to be wearing those same clothes when you cuddle up to a loved one. He blows me a kiss and says he'll see me after I shower.",

You don't say how long you have been together, or if this is a pattern with her but I'm guessing it's mostly caused by insecurities. Over her body, and possibly her job as well.\n\nYou need to sit down and talk it out. Ask her why it upset her so much, listen, reassure her if necessary, and tell her how you feel about her response and her actions since then. Be calm and don't get defensive. \n\nI don't know how you guys normally handle conflicts. Hopefully she will be willing to discuss what happened and the two of you can reach an understanding.

I'm seeing a lot of opinions here that are ridiculously recalcitrant in \"He didn't do anything wrong. He shouldn't do anything. Screw her.\"\n\nBeing in a relationship isn't about being technically correct or always being fair. It's often irrational, capricious, emotional, and sometimes just plain all kinds of stoopid. Having a relationship means that when one partner dips that way, the other is strong enough to be the rock that can stand it, has the empathy to see where the misunderstanding stems from, has enough humility to apologize first even when they think they're in the right. At least gets things moving in the right direction instead of just taking a \"well fuck you then\" attitude. (Often the first apology is maybe the least meaningful, but it's the most important one.)\n\nConsider her perspective. It's a corny gesture, but let's be generous and assume it was meant with the best intentions. It's always a little hard to see someone reject a gift. It must be doubly so when it's very directly tied to your ego, self-worth, and self-doubts that we all have over our own bodies and self-image. Now, in the larger perspective, is that logical? Course not. But again, being a relationship isn't about everything being considered perfectly logically like some procedural math problem. She may be overreacting, if it's a been a few days, she's spiraling on it weirdly. But, if you really care about this person, her emotions have validity and deserve some comforting too.\n\nNow, I feel for OP, and let's step back a second -- he didn't do anything wrong, this is true. But he wants to do something to fix the situation. That's the context in which the question in framed. So the comments from people saying she should just \"grow up\", I'm willing to bet are all from people who have no experience in relationships, or the type who have lots of short-lived ones that never last beyond their first fight.",

It also sounds like you two are due for a chat as she might be projecting insecurity onto you about working from home OR she might actually be picking up on some resentment you're feeling towards her because she's working from home while you're being endangered on the daily. And I think your feelings are warranted here.\n\nShe's probably stressed and worried about you and that may also account for the sarcasm she's throwing your way, but she's going to have to adjust.

As a female I can tell you we get hurt pretty easily when we feel like we're not pretty enough or whatever. She should know that you were just exhausted from working so hard at the hospital. From her approach it sounds like she wanted to try and surprise you after a long shift at work by showing up naked, and giving you a good time cause she knows you've been working so hard. Tiktok is dumb. I'm sure none of those guys work in a hospital working 12 hour shifts. That's something that she has to understand. Good luck and sending good vibes your way!",

I know twelves drain you especially when you're only getting maybe four or eight hours in between those twelves but don't minimize the fact that while you're out at work she is missing you and thinking of ways to surprise you (that involves booty!!) to make you feel loved. If that's not the way to make you feel loved, then help her learn the ways that she can love you that aren't draining to you, and that also help her feel loved.

And the longer she acts this way, the higher level immature you are going to score her card.\n\nShe may be working at home, but her brain is on vacation. \n\nAnd yeah, I get she wanted the ego boost of the video and response, but her timing for that ego boost was waaaaaay off.\n\nYou are dealing with our century's Spanish Flu. She needs to get her head in the game on that. And you do not need her demanding you play silly relationship games with her at a time like this. \n\nTell her that you have noticed her snark. You have noticed that she is interpreting your refusal to go along with her game as meaning something it does not. And tell her that she is trying to establish an unhealthy relationship dynamic, which is that in times where one partner is in high levels of stress the other partner gets to check the fuck out and not give proper support. Let her know, you both need to recalibrate or move on from each other. \n\nThis pandemic is not going to get better tomorrow.  And the stress is only going to build. Tik Tok silliness can wait for when things are over. And you might want to point out to her how vapid posting a video like that in times like these it makes her look.\n\nYou do a serious job, which requires a serious partner at home to help you through the rough days. Tell her she needs to reflect on whether or not she  can be that partner. Or does she want to live her life for the Insta-fame? She can't have both.\n\nI am so fucking pissed off on your behalf. If it was me, I would be cooking your favourite fucking meal and having a nice fresh cold brewski waiting for you when you got out of the shower. And you'd get a nice shoulder rub too. \n\nFucking hell. Some women do not help women. She is one of them.\n\nShe might be hot, but her brain is drowning in it's self-absorption.\n\nCall her out and then tell you aren't playing.\n\nMaybe you shot her down harder than she was needing to be shot down in the moment. And if so, apologise for that, but no more trying to make you feel the guilty party. Work on your communication or this will only get worse.",

            "comment": "Bro, I had a date with a girl from Tinder.... She got upset, because when i picked her up for our date i was talking on the phone. This way, according to her, I was unable to fully appreciate the way she was dressed, because I had an urgent call and instead of admiring at her while she was approaching the car i was in a phone call....\n\nThe idea is, that girls have a plan for some things... How it will play out. If your reaction is not according to their plan... they get upset... Witch is super weird, but that's the way it goes !",

It might seem like a ridiculous thing but comparing ourselves  to other people on social media is something that a lot of young people do. \n\nTell her that you love her and do something to make her feel sexy. Perhaps decorate your room for a special night or something like that. Something that maybe she could feel proud of or share on social. Then explain to her that your reaction had nothing to do with how beautiful she is, you were just really really tired that day. Clarify that then focus on hyping her up. \n\nThis COVID stuff has everybody on edge and irritable and things can be blown out of proportion just try and bring her back down to earth and remind her how beautiful you think she is.",

    "postText": "I (21F) started talking to a guy (35M) last year while my boyfriend(29M) and I were dating. I know it was wrong but our relationship was going downhill (We should of broken up) \n\nMy boyfriend and I were in the talks of taking a break for a couple of months and see how good it'll do for us and we'll decide if we want to be together after our break.\n\nWhen that conversation happened it made me sad and I started going on dating apps and I met the guy (35M). We started talking a lot and we hit it off. We had somethings in common and he seemed like a nice guy.\n\nWell this is where it got tricky, we hooked up and honestly it was the best I've ever felt. I guess that feeling was amplified due to the fact my boyfriend and I were in a rocky place. But he made me feel things I haven't felt in a while.\n\nHe also listened to me a lot when I spoke I, as I had so many things I wanted to tell my boyfriend and he never gave me the time of day. Our little hookup lasted about a month before my boyfriend found out, which was like one of my worst days ever.\nI felt bad for lying to my boyfriend and we weren't officially broken up but we were both leaning towards a break.\n\nWell after he found out, we obviously broke up and so much things happened that week, where I ended up in the hospital.\n\nMy boyfriend wanted nothing to do with me which was understandable but it made me so upset. The other guy felt bad for the situation and his response was \"hopefully you'll find someone better\". Lol\n\nWell, after a week my boyfriend forgave me and we had a long talk and wanted to make it work.(I do love him and he\u2019s a great guy) I agreed that I did want to make it work.\n\nI told the other guy and I guess he was offended because he \"didn't like how my boyfriend treated me\" and I deserve someone better.\n\nWe stopped talking but I think about him all the time because I guess I still have feelings for him or whatever. He made me feel alive when we were together and I still don't feel like that with my boyfriend, although I used.\n\nI did reach out to the guy couple times and he's always says I'm not mad, I just wish you well.\n\nWell lately, I've been thinking about him a lot, like the thought of him makes me feel crazy and my head hurts lol. \n\nSo i reached out like an idiot. He hasn't responded. I feel like so stupid and desperate and it isn't fair to my boyfriend.\n\nhow do i move on from the other guy?\n\nI need tips and advice because I feel like I\u2019m going insane.",

Not the kind of guy you want in your corner when shit gets real.\n\n  \nLet's pivot to your ex. Here's the deal: you're stuck in a loop. You split, he discovered your fling, he went ballistic, you got hospitalized, and now you're back to square one. That's not a rollercoaster you want a lifetime ticket for.  \n\n\nDon't kid yourself, neither of these guys, the ex or Mr. 35, are your answer. You are. Your happiness isn't hitched to some guy's wagon, it's about understanding yourself and striving to be the best you.\n\n  \nYou felt alive with Mr. 35, not because of him, but because you were real with yourself. You stopped settling. You don't need him to feel alive, you need to be unapologetically you.  \nThis isn't about ditching Mr. 35, it's about ditching the idea that your worth is tied to someone else. Time to fly solo, figure out what makes you tick. Embrace being single, validate yourself.\n\n  \nRemember: Your future isn\u2019t found in your rearview mirror, but through the windshield. Bigger, bolder, more badass\u2014that\u2019s the journey. Focus on the road ahead, not what's behind. That\u2019s moving on.",

I understand that I\u2019m young, and I have my whole life a head of me and maybe I shouldnt date older men, but unfortunately that\u2019s what I am attracted to. \n\nThe 35M was a jerk to me at times but I guess that\u2019s just how he is lol. I know I should have feelings for him as he did dip the min things got insane between my bf and i, which is understandable. He didn\u2019t want to be part of that problem but he certainly wasn\u2019t against it when we were in bed. Typical behavior. \n\nI am trying to let go, I really am and i did have a talk with my bf about being single and he did not like that conversation. He thinks I want to break up with him so I can hook up with other people and that\u2019s not the case. \n\nThank you for your kind words they are definitely helpful. \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc",

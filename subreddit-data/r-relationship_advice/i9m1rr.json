    "postText": "First post:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i3il7r/boyfriend_18m_is_upset_that_my_18f_brother_26m/\n\nBased on the advice of you guys, my parents and my brother, I broke up with my boyfriend.\n\nSo I asked my boyfriend what he expected to happen that night if he was allowed to spend the night with me. He repeatedly said nothing but let slip that maybe he hoped we\u2019d have sex in the morning. So you guys were right, he wanted to have sex that night with me and he probably would have if he was allowed to spend the night with me. \n\nEven the thought of it gives me a lot of stress. I always knew rape is a danger a lot of women (and men) face, but never felt it so close to me. Maybe because I\u2019ve always been with people I trust. I don\u2019t know. I never thought it could happen so easily to me. It would have happened to me that night if my brother hadn\u2019t protected me the way he did.\n\nI\u2019m going to be a lot more careful about my own safety from now on. I won\u2019t be as trusting to strangers and I\u2019m now learning my drinking limits so that I won\u2019t overdo it especially where I might be vulnerable. My brother also told me to never accept a drink from the people I don\u2019t 100% trust.\n\nThanks reddit!",

It also gives help with healing and moving on (anyone who escapes abuse has a LOT of healing to do). \n\nI am so glad she has friends like you.  Sometimes people don't understand when their friend loses contact during the abuse/isolation. It's nothing to do with how she feels about her friends, it's about protecting herself from his reaction and protecting his reputation from the harm of being a known abuser.",

I don't want to give unrealistic hope to people being abused and it is not safe for everyone to try.\n\nMy spouse was abusive. We do not have any children. As with most abusive relationships, I was the frog in the pot of boiling water trying to figure out what had gone wrong, what I could do to fix the relationship.  I did not even know it was abuse, until he knocked me unconscious and choked me.  Then I read \"Why Does He Do That?\" by Lundy Bancroft (free online here https://archive.org/details/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat)\n\nIt helped me put a name on what was happening and showed me the benefit he got from abusing me. It explained that even if he stopped drinking and never hit me again, the abuse would continue.  It taught me that arguing with him or defending myself against his wild  accusations would never accomplish anything.  I could only say what I wanted one time and then get physically away from him.\n\nHe did quit drinking, but the abuse (screaming, put downs, accusations, punching holes in doors etc) continued.  I then got the next book \"Should I Stay or Should I Go\" by Lundy Bancroft.  It laid out exactly how to tell if he was actually addressing the attitudes and beliefs that allowed him to feel justified in abusing me or if he was just back in the honeymoon period which would inevitably be followed by more abuse. \n\nThe very first thing he needed to do to actually change was to admit that he was an abuser.  He needed to admit that he CHOSE to hurt me. Until he could do this, we could not fix the problem. This I think, was the hardest step for him. Most abusers HAVE to feel they are right. He had convinced himself that when I yelled back or fought back that I was abusive as well.  The last thing he wanted was to take FULL responsibility for the abuse in our relationship. In his mind I was just trying to avoid responsibility and pin everything on him. \n\nFor almost a year after quitting drinking he went to counseling and though he learned to communicate better, he did not accept he was abusive (neither did his therapist).  I had to start setting and maintaining better boundaries.  One of my boundaries was that if I said \"time out\" or \"leave me alone\" during and argument he HAD to stop, EVERY time.  I told him if he couldn't do this I could not be with him.  I told him the abuse HAD to stop before I could start healing.  I was going to move my life forward to a healthy place and I hoped he would come with me... but I could not wait for him.\n\nHe broke the time out boundary 3 times.  I gave him two warnings and the final time I told him we needed to separate. This was a VERY important step.  They are many benefits to being an abuser, it's hard for people to give up benefits and do hard work to change their way of relating to the world if they get nothing in return. He needed to know that I would no longer accept an abusive relationship and I HAD to mean it. \n\nHe was really stuck in his growth and didn't know how to fix things. He didn't see himself as an abuser.  What finally got through to him was a worksheet for abusers (also by Lundy Bancroft link to worksheet here: https://lundybancroft.com/articles/guide-for-men-who-are-serious-about-changing-part-1/ ).  He read it and recognized some of his attitudes towards me and his thought process.  \n\nHe took the workbook to his therapist and told him he saw himself in it and wanted to work on these things specifically.  \n\nIt was a huge shift in how he listened to me, how he saw and treated me, the way he spoke of the past. It was uncomfortable difficult work for him, but he was almost relieved to find sonething he could do to fix things. It's a work in progress, but he is finally the good man I  always felt was underneath the bluster and lies.  He's being vulnerable and honest with me now and we can have conversations about things he does that are hold-overs from his abusive past (no matter how small) and challenge the thought process that led him to the decision.  It has been about 6 months now and our relationship is night and day different. We still live separately, but he will be moving back in the next few months.  We are finally experiencing TRUE intimacy, we are eachother's safe place.\n\nNot all abusers are just horrible people, my husband had never experienced unconditional love and was very insecure underneath a narcissistic mask of confidence he showed to the world.  \n\nThis is just our story.  If you are in an abusive relationship please read these books.  Please do NOT think you can fix the abuse while in the relationship.  Please be careful when you leave.  Please do NOT go to therapy with your abuser, it will make things worse.  If you want to know if he is really changing here is a good checklist. \n\n\nhttps://lundybancroft.com/articles/checklist-for-assessing-change-in-men-who-abuse-women/\n\nI know all of the info I shared is from the same author. I promise I'm not getting a kick back... I just found his works easy to digest and follow. This is what worked for us.  Most abusers will be unwilling to accept that they are abusive and do the work to change. Abusive relationships are SO much more than hitting, everyone deserves to be treated with kindness and respect.\n\nEdit: typos and a link to the work book for abusers and\n\nif you have abused your loved one you CAN change, you have been taught a way of relating to others that helped you survive (from childhood, when you were powerless), but now you are hurting someone you love and you don't need to.  There are so many benefits to challenging the automatic thought process that no longer serves you.  You need to trust the person you love with ALL of you, they wouldn't still be around if they didn't love the real you. It's OK to admit you were wrong and that you did things that hurt someone you loved. Know better, be better right? My husband has seen so much growth in ALL areas of his life since he started questioning his \"way\" was harmful. You can be an abuser and not know it, you can hurt someone you love when you have good intentions, AND being wrong or admitting fault actually makes you (and your relationship) stronger NOT weaker. Click this link and give yourself a chance to have a truly intimate relationship where you share unconditional love and acceptance... it is all within your grasp if you are willing to let go of perfection and trust your loved one with all of you. I believe you can do it! \n https://lundybancroft.com/articles/guide-for-men-who-are-serious-about-changing-part-1/",

I think you\u2019re very right, there is a gross benefit to being an abuser and humans do not like moving away from benefits. I really hope a lot of people don\u2019t see your comment here and take that as a green flag for their own battered relationship. I hope he continues to be this person, for your sake. As a weak nobody who is hyper aware, I can be moved to abusive behavior. Usually verbal, but it\u2019s still bad. I don\u2019t want to make people feel bad, I don\u2019t want to talk to them the way I talk to myself. So I\u2019d like to use these Resources to better myself, because there\u2019s really no benefit if you have self-awareness. You just go off the handle and then suffer through the guilt later. The benefits are really very paperthin. I hope I can become a better person like your spouse, I wish you both the very best luck.",

I noticed a while ago that if I look at what is happening and reduce it to the most fundamental part, tantrums by both adults and children are almost always the result of frustration in the context of expectation. \n\n\nIt's obvious and easy with children, and they are still learning so they are absolutely justified in having tantrums and meltdowns. It's our job to try to help them see how their emotions are stemming from the frustration, and to help them learn to manage that frustration with more chill and class. Unfortunately, I suspect it is much harder for an adult to reform their behavior if they have never learned or been taught to accept various frustrations and work through it internally.",

The guys? We\u2019re sympathetic but since they had known him as long as I have known her, they were in shock/ denial. \n\nSeparate time : \n\nThen another friend in that group almost raped me.

Then some of the party members decided to go look for me *they said they heard a girl say to stop * If that garage door wouldn\u2019t have opened I would\u2019ve been raped. I was saved.

One could no longer have children because of physical fallout from the assault. It is far too common, and often goes unpunished. I worry about the women who OP's ex will encounter. Will they have strong friends and family to look out for them? Will they feel justified in reporting abuse should it occur? I applaud her brother, because he was aware, and willing to risk an uncomfortable situation and keep his perspective. Sometimes that's all it takes.",

It's a culture that believes individual liberties give you the right to drink away your autonomy. Or that \"signals\" are a justification for accelerating a physical relationship. I grew up in it, and it's disgusting to look bad on my teenage years and think about how all my friends were acting, how I was acting, or how my partners acted. Some didn't know about respect so they thought pushing their partners was normal; others being pushed didn't understand how respect and autonomy was supposed to work, so instead they would send mixed signals that they didn't intend to. And when you tried to get advice from within the culture, the answer was always misplaced:\n\n- _\"Don't have physical relationships before marriage - problem solved\"_\n- _\"Communication is key\"_ (i.e. I won't teach you anything, so stay clueless and go talk to your equally clueless boyfriend/girlfriend about it)\n- Or worst of all, the sex-positive ignorance in responses like _\"She'll give in eventually\"_ or _\"If you like them, give it up.\"_\n\nRomantic ignorance like that is further reinforced by the media portrayals, where people just click and their attractions are all on the same page. It's dangerous, because it tells ignorant people that \"I want this and therefore they do too\" (pretty much exactly what OP's boyfriend was doing). It breeds sexual predators, and then releases them into a world in which they will immediately be vilified for actions they've been conditioned to accept as normal. Instead of seeing their predatory actions as wrong, they will ignorantly perceive themselves as victims. \n\nThe upside to this cultural travesty is that honest, sincere education works really well to curb it. That's why it's great to be the kind of sex-positive person who can talk about consent, autonomy, or at least share [kickass funny videos about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQbei5JGiT8).",

Found out the next morning a 20-something y/o dude from the party tried to stay and sneak into bed with me and was even bragging about how he was going to try to fuck me. Apparently my big sister beat his ass and choked him against a wall, and my male cousin threw him off the fire escape lol.

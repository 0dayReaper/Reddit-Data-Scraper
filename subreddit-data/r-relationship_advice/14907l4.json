    "postText": "Hi Reddit!\n\nI (22m) have been dating this girl (23f) for about 10 months now and it has been the best 10 months of my life. It's my first real long term relationship so I've definitely struggled being the best boyfriend possible. One of the problems she faces in our relationship is security, especially when we are away from each other. I love this girl with all my heart and I try to show it as much as possible, but does anyone have any advice on ways to make their partner feel more secure or loved whether through actions or words? Or honestly just tips on being a good boyfriend in a relationship. I'm terribly inexperienced and just want to make her happy. \n\nThanks for any advice!",

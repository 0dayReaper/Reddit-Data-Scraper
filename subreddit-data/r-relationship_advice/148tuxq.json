    "postText": "Closure or No Closure\n\nMy pops works in this warehouse. I am currently in school finishing my degree. He puts me on with this girl in the warehouse that is my age. It\u2019s been about a month. We have been on a date and it was cool. I\u2019ve been trying to get her to go on another one but it has been difficult to plan based on her schedule. She could have potential but it\u2019s hard to see her or even talk her through the phone. She is pretty and even pretty cool to converse with when we do talk. Communication was something she said she was big on but the whole time it has been really inconsistent. She doesn\u2019t seem to have certain qualities I desire character wise but I\u2019d rather not expose her flaws in the face of disinterest. I have goals on the brink of fruition so I have a lot of work to do anyways. Would be nice to take her on the journey but if it\u2019s not this then it\u2019s that. I have decided to continue to pursue my goals but should I ghost her cause she\u2019s been distant or reach out and give her closure about my redirection?",

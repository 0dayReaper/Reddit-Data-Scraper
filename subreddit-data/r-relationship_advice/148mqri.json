That level of dedication to one another is love, and fears of finances in the case of a divorce means 1. He values his finances more than you and 2. Believes there is a higher chance things won't work out than will. The biggest issue here, in my eyes, is that he holds this over you. That you'll \"only ever be a girlfriend\", as if he's rubbing it in your face. This is cruel. My partner wasn't one who wanted to get married. He had similar views before we started dating, but now is excited to get married and is certain we would never split. His opinion has changed, in that he believes he didn't want to get married because he hadn't met the one, but now he has, and it's exciting for him. You deserve someone who feels the same; I would leave him.",

It sounds like you'll need to accept his decision and either stay with him or be willing to walk away and look for a another man who is willing to get married.  From what I'm seeing though, fewer men are willing to take that risk anymore. Even though my divorce was very amicable (and child-free), it was obvious that family courts are anti-Male. So the only way I'd ever consider it again is if we were both child-free, wanting children, able to have children, and we brought similar assets into the marriage. Otherwise, it's not worth it \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

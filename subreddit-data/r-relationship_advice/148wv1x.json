    "postText": "Basically I still like him but I tend to repress all those feelings to forget I have them. I don't like him the same way anymore, not even close, I guess it's more because of the pain, resentment, and hate that I feel for him. He gave up on me, and I maybe? have another person.\nBut unfortunately, despite all this, I still like him (for now). \n\nANYWAYS. The series we were watching together, some are really good and I wanna watch the next eps. But every time I'm about to watch any of them, the memories with him come. Even thinking about one of them, makes me feel sad. And THEN my method of repress-feelings is ruined and I don't like that!\nHow can I overcome this?",

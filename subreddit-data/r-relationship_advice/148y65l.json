    "postText": "So, my boyfriend and I have been together on and off since we've been 14 years old. When we started having sex he would exclusively top, not because I didn't want to top, but because he never seemed interested in bottoming or my dick at all, just really obsessed with my ass. I felt embarrassed to ask him to let me top or pay attention to my dick. I thought he should just want to and take the initiative. \n\nAfter years of hinting at my lack of pleasure, I told him how I felt. Initially there was push back and I chalked it up to us not being sexually compatible and tried to discuss our options; open relationship or break up.  We decided we wanted neither and he said he doesn't mind bottoming or giving me head but he's just not use to it  and needs time to get better. \n\nCurrently he has made some efforts to incorporate my dick during foreplay but now that we've agreed to verse, sex is awkward and unnatural. There's like this silent power struggle. \n\nAt first, I didn't care if sometimes he'd just top as long as there were sometimes I could just top, but it got to a point where I'd let him top me and then whenever I got in the mood he had an excuse. So we decided we'd have sex when we're both in the mood to ensure it's fair. \n\nThat didn't really help, we've lost all rhythm. I think he has a hard time being submissive naturally and I have a hard time being submissive for someone who can't be for me. \n\nEven deciding who goes first is a struggle: I'll be eating his ass then grab the lube so I can go in and as I'm doing so, he'll start eating my ass &amp; grab the lube from me to start fucking me. Or sometimes after he's being topping and I go to switch I can see he was not ready to stop topping and vice versa, sometimes I feel like he cuts me off too soon. \n\nIs there anyway to solve this weird power struggle?",

    "postText": "\nHi all, \n\nI'm looking for some thoughts on this. My partner [32F] and I [30M] have been in a relationship for close to a year, but we have known eachother for much longer. We currently live in different cities, spending most weekends (and sometimes longer weekends) together. We both have issues with sleep, both are light sleepers. I snore, which keeps my SO awake. My SO can spend hours awake before falling asleep. Plus, our work schedules are different and only causes a bit of disruption. \n\nSo, she is looking into moving to my city with us finding a 2-bed property. Both of us are thrilled about this. \n\nBoth of us agree that sleeping in separate bedrooms would be the best, as we would then just share a bed a few times per week. Neither of us think it will affect our sex life, as we have similar sex drive. \n\nHas any of you tried something similar and how did it work out? \n\nThank you in advance",

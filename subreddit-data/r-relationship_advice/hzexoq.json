    "postText": "My(17m) family is having a reunion at our house and my cousin(8f) often lies to get people in trouble.\n\nYesterday I had to use the bathroom and accidentally walked in on my cousin in the shower. I apologized and left but when she got out she told everyone that I was spying on her. Several of my family members believed her while others knew that she was lying. Since they were staying at our house for a week I have to spend the rest of the time in my room not leaving unless I had to use the bathroom.\n\nIt\u2019s Aggravating to have almost half of my family think I\u2019m a creep and get punished for it. What should I do\n\nEdit:I didn\u2019t hear the shower running because my hearing aids had died and I didn\u2019t have anymore batteries",

But children are capable of doing those things and worse on a daily basis. I just had this argument with someone the other day, that sometimes people are just born evil and that's the way it is. It's not always because they were abused, or because they had some terrible home life or because they didn't get enough attention or whatever the excuse is that somebody wants to make for that particular child\n\nDealing with child psychology is tough sometimes, because we don't always know exactly how to deal with that particular child. And in the rare instances that it is just a bad person, therapy isn't always going to work. And that child will just continue to grow and be a bad adult. It's just the way of the world.",

If they truly believe you are some kind of predator, the smart thing to do would be to remove the 8 year old from the situation and stay somewhere else, not keep you confined to your room.\n\n\n\nOP, you gotta get out of there before it gets worse. You're looking at a very bleak future with no job prospects or friendly neighbors if you continue to stay in an environment where you're being accused of pedophilia. \n\n\n\nEven if you have to stay at a hotel for the week, do it for your own protection. You can't prove a negative, and trying to will only make you look worse. Also, cut all contact with the girl so you can't be accused of anything else in the future.",

Being grounded to my room and staying there to me shows i am complicit in what she is saying and I wouldn\u2019t stand for it and if my parents decide i need to be in my room then they think very little of their child and believe i did such a horrible thing.",

This behavior isn't normal for an 8 year old, she might be experiencing abuse.\n\nI could be completely wrong but you should definitely get her to a therapist and let her talk to someone, something doesn't smell right here.",

So now OP is trying to say that she lied when she was 6-7 (at most!), despite their being enough evidence to convict. \n\nHe knew her past and has some crazy story about the bathroom door \u201calways\u201d being closed even when unoccupied despite his family knowing he would be unable to hear someone inside?\nHe also had no choice but to break the lock prior? \n\nEven if he did accidentally walk-in on her, she has reason to be afraid!

Though he says he with with the friend that day the girl said she was assaulted. \nAt a minimum, this is a story about a very young child who was sexually abused by someone associated with OP and then had him walk in on her in the shower. \nIf that triggered her, then it\u2019s 100% not her fault. \nAnd OP should know that his friend is CONVICTED of sexually assaulting her and been much more careful around her. \nMistakes do happen, but the child deserves better.",

Often when a child accuses someone of doing something they didn\u2019t do, such as this instance right here, it\u2019s because the person they\u2019re accusing is a safer target than who is actually doing it. They know something is wrong and want help but they are too scared to actually admit who it is. She very well could be scape goating you as a cry for help to authority figures when it could be someone she perceives as more dangerous, like a parent, older sibling, etc. a closer family relation. \n\nAt that age, she\u2019s old enough to know that making shit up isn\u2019t smart, but she might not know of all of the consequences of her actions or might be too terrified to follow through in asking for help. She isn\u2019t coming up with this on her own. \n\nI hope you are able to figure out what is truly going on to save your dignity and honor but to more importantly to save your cousin.",

            "comment": "Ok, so this one is very tricky...\n\nIt absolutely sucks that you were blamed of something you didn't do, but let's look at the big picture here...\n\n&gt;my cousin(8f) often lies to get people in trouble\n\nThat's absolutely not normal. It's normal that a child lies to get their way, but getting people in trouble? No, that's not normal. She might've realized at some point that she can get even at people by doing that, or she might just enjoy the attention. Both are clear signs that something is wrong with her, and she needs professional help. Does she realize the consequences of doing that? Does she care?\n\n&gt;when she got out she told everyone that I was spying on her\n\nHow could she know this would get you in trouble? Did she just take a wild guess or did she know she was accusing you of sexual harassment? If she didn't guess, then she has been abused before, or she was exposed to sex-related topics in an irresponsible manner. Both are bad things, and both justify getting professional help.\n\n&gt;Several of my family members believed her while others knew that she was lying\n\nWho and who? Did your parents have your back? Have you talked this out with them alone?\n\n&gt;I have to spend the rest of the time in my room\n\nWhy? Were you grounded by your parents or are you just avoiding the other people?\n\nNow, about the accusation... You see, if I had been there, and I had heard my 8 y/o relative say something like that, I would've believed them, 100%. \n\nThat's because I know there *are* 8 year-old girls and boys being sexually abused and raped out there, who don't ever get help, because their families didn't believe them when they told. \"Oh, but uncle Joe wouldn't do that, you're lying!\" is just a life sentence of abuse, because they won't tell anyone anymore. Some families even know the abuse is happening, yet they don't say anything, out of fear of it getting out there and \"ruining\" the family. And even if the family initially believes the child, often they'd go confront the abuser, and they'll just manipulate the truth to undermine the child's version. \"Oh, but it wasn't like that! I just didn't realized it was being used, so I *walked into the bathroom*, but got out right away...\" and people would believe that, because it sounds so reasonable, and who would want to have an abuser in their family, right?\n\nYour cousin was actually blessed with a family that believes her, unlike many real abuse victims, who have to live in fear and trauma because no one would take their word.\n\nWhat your cousin did isn't just wrong because she blamed you of something you didn't do. It's wrong because she's using a very sensitive, serious situation, as sexual abuse is, to get a laugh out of it. She's ruining innocent lives, but what's even worse is that she's endangering other children's and women's lives, by fueling the arguments of some misogynistic assholes who believe \"rape/abuse isn't *that* common, and women lie to get their way\", and refuse to change the system so that it actually helps victims, instead of protecting abusers.\n\nI suggest you talk this out with your aunt, saying what I wrote above, that you totally understand why they believed her, and that you actually admire their support, but your cousin has a history of lying and getting people in trouble and that could have serious consequences for all. Tell her that you know it's word against word in this one, but that you're more worried about your cousin doing this than about your reputation. Shortly tell what really happened, and say that it's up to her what to believe, but what she must do is get the girl to see a psychologist and get to the root of this.",

    "postText": "Sorry if the formatting isn't any good, I'm on mobile\n\n\nMy boyfriend and I are supposed to get married very soon, on Thursday to be specific. We've been together for three years which is fine, but I've been struggling for the past few months with our relationship.\n\nI'm not really sure why my feelings towards the relationship turned over time ? He's always been very good and sweet to me. The age difference only bothered me in the context of life later on, but that's besides the point.\n\nAt some point this year I had cheated on my boyfriend, I felt very guilty and told him about it.. I understand I did something horrible, but ever since the way he demands sex from me has gotten worse(?). As well as dismissing how I feel if he hurts my feelings.\n\nThere had been times he would have sex with me without my consent. Like in my sleep or when I just woke up and can barely consent to what's happening. But lately it has gotten worse,,\n\nThe last instance of it happening we had been drinking. I told him multiple times I didn't feel good and just wanted to sleep, but he proceeded to try to have sex with me anyways. There's also the issue of if there's too many days of us not having sex, he tries to guilt me into it and make me feel bad. Or if we have a genuinely good day he expects for us to have sex..\n\n\nI've been trying to leave him for months because of these things, but I can't seem to do it. I work up the courage and then back down because a part of me feels like it's somehow a mistake. (I'm pretty sure its just the memories and familiarity holding me back) I've already had talks with him, and he says he'll do better and then ends up doing these things again.\n\nI want to know how much of a mistake would I be making if I just comply and marry my boyfriend instead of trying to get away. I'm not even sure I really want this marriage,,,",

However his behavior is intentional and extremely harmful, with no remorse. What he is doing is r*pe, and he is making use of the extremely off power balance between you that already existed before from the age difference. The age gap is a huge red flag by itself, because guys like that are sometimes specifically looking for an unequal partner. His behavior towards you confirms this so clearly. As the more mature one, he should have been having deep conversations with you and guiding the relationship through it. Trust me, when you are 49, you most likely won't even consider a 25 year old, because that will probably feel icky and unbalanced to you. Hell I am 39, and I couldn't even conceive of dating a 25 year old. Not because I am judging an age gap, but because I am looking for someone to be my equal, but your man is not, and it is showing very clearly in his behavior. Knowing how abuse patterns usually evolve, it's only gonna get worse from here, and the best thing for you would be to get out of there asap!",

Should your spouse do this without your consent, it\u2019s rape. Should your spouse coerce you into having sex by making you feel guilty, it\u2019s rape. Marriage doesn\u2019t change that.",

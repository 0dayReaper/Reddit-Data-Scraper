    "postText": "I work for the same company as my best friend and we recently were up for the same promotion. I got it and she said she was happy for me but now I\u2019ve found out she\u2019s the one who started the rumour that I was fucking our boss and that\u2019s why I got the promotion over her.\r  \n\r  \nWe\u2019re both friends with him from long before we started working here but he wasn\u2019t the one who decided who got the promotion and I\u2019m not fucking him. Nothing has happened between us since I started working here so he had no reason to be biased towards me. When I asked him about the promotion, he said it was my direct boss who chose me for the promotion over her.\r  \n\r  \nHe knows about the rumour but he told me not to confront my best friend or any other colleagues as it would only add fuel to the fire. This isn\u2019t the first time there\u2019s been a rumour that he\u2019s been sleeping with an employee and he said he refuses to acknowledge bullshit and I needed to do the same.\r  \n\r  \nI thought I could keep my mouth shut but then I realised my best friend was the one who started it and now I\u2019m just so fucking angry because while most people are ignoring it, it\u2019s definitely changed my dynamic with others and just makes me feel so awkward at work knowing I'm the office gossip. I\u2019m trying to WFH as much as possible but I have to stop avoiding the office because my boss prefers having us in. I\u2019m worried when I see her I\u2019ll just blurt it out.\r  \n\r  \nDo you guys think I should confront her despite my boss telling me not to? Would it be better for me to just do what he says and ignore things and hope it all dies down eventually?\r  \n\r  \nTL;DR \u2013 My best friend started a rumour that I\u2019m fucking our boss after I got a promotion instead of her. I\u2019m not but he wants me to keep my mouth shut but I don\u2019t know how not to confront her when I see her in person. ",

Especially if he wasn't in a position to promote you.** You don't want to call attention to your previous history. JOP, just go into the office and work. The more you avoid it, the more true it will seem.\n\nOP, block the \"BF\" everywhere. Stop speaking to her about anything other than work. She's just a colleague.\n\nIf you want to be a dick, as long as you all have previously disclosed your connections to each other to HR, I would just quietly point out to someone chatty that you all knew each other before you worked together. \"I don't know why she's saying this to people.

Let HR know nothing happened and now you feel as if she has created a hostile work place. It sucks, but you might have to get your source involved, the one that told you she started the rumor. \n\nIf the source lied, am sure they would be fired. Way more than likely, HR will fire the former friend and address then situation to make sure all know it didn't happen, plus this behavior will not be tolerated.",

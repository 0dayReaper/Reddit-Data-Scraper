    "postText": "I (23m) find it tough to communicate with my girlfriend (22f) about things that worry me\n\nMy girlfriend is tough to communicate with at times\n\nOkay, so as the title suggests, I have a hard time being able to communicate my worries and feelings with her sometimes.  Theres way more to it than that, which I'll get into.\n\nSo my girlfriend, who I'll call Anne, and I have been together for about a month, which isnt a long time at all, I know.  But I'm very new to having a healthy non-toxic relationship, as the last few people I've been with have been less than ideal.  Anne and I met and we instantly clicked, and after a day or two of talking we decided to get together.   She also has not seen a healthy relationship so it's new for both of us, but shes a very sweet and genuine girl who does treat me VERY well, and I try my absolute hardest to treat her the best I can too.  We have amazing chemistry as well and it's been great so far. \n\nNow, introductions aside; She has a lot of mental issues due to past trauma in her life and all the unfortunate things that have happened to her.  She isnt very good at accepting help when shes dealing with emotions, she prefers to just deal with it herself because that's all she knows and shes always been independent.  She gets mentally drained very easily and she becomes tough to communicate with, especially over text.\n\nOkay now I'll get into my issues to help you guys understand why I worry the way I do about some stuff.  Her and I have talked about how we want to stay together forever, like getting married and having kids and we've even gone into detail on what we'd want out of life with each other, and we have mostly the same wants and needs, shes literally perfect in every way for me and she does assure me that she'd never leave me.  But I've been told that before in past relationships and they definitely werent being truthful, so I worry that she too, will change her mind.  Shes so much better than the last people I've been with.  Now having said all that, it seems like theres really no problem, but like I said, the past women I've been with have told me about how they would never leave me or anything, and then they did that, so I worry she will leave me, and I dont want to be the guy that needs constant reassurance because I feel like that's not healthy, in a way.  But I've never stressed so much about anything before in my life, and Its hard for me to talk to her about it because i dont want to worry her more and give her more things to stress about than she already does.  I just dont want to be the reason she worries more.  \n\nIm hoping that any of you guys have advice on things I can do to help myself not stress about her leaving me or to help stop myself from overthinking every little thing.  Or maybe someone could give me advice on how to approach her with this?  I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this and help me on this.",

            "comment": "Ok, so to be sure - it's not a her issue? She isn't doing something in particular that makes it hard for you to talk to her? Other than her wanting to solve her own issues?\n\nIf your fears are about how past relationships ended after promises of forever and you don't wish to burden her with needing to constantly reassure here than do consider therapy to work out these issues.\n\nEveryone has different coping mechanisms and ways to work through these feelings.  Most people who have experienced dating more than a few people have dealt with this. It's part of the point of dating,  finding out if that first blush of love is sustainable but as you pointed out it wouldn't be healthy to make it a her issue.\n\nSometimes,  when I'm dealing with tough emotions that I need to work out I like to write it down, in a journal. Sometimes, I write it from different perspectives, leave it for a couple of days and write down what I'm thinking again and seeing if anything changed or if I've brought a new view to it.",

I do actually write in a journal and I've found that it helps, but I appreciate that advice, makes me feel like it truly is a good coping mechanism.   I've thought about therapy or counseling for myself, so I may look into it. \n\nShe isnt neccesarily doing anything that's making it tougher for me to communicate, but like I said, I'd rather not give her even more to worry about, and even if I did bring it to her in an attempt to talk about it, it doesnt help to talk over text, as it's hard to interpret the tone of messages and feelings, and shes overall a kind of dry texter.  and shes been too busy to call on the phone recently, so its also not a huge possibility we could meet in person for the time being either.\n\nOverall, I'm sure this will work out, this just isnt the first time I've had worries like this, I think it's just a personal thing for me, which further helps your point of therapy, so I may look into that.  It's just something that's had me very stressed the past couple of days, so I figured I'd try reaching out to people on Reddit for any advice.  You've helped me with your reply, stranger, I appreciate you taking the time.",

Don\u2019t dwell on the worst outcome and enjoy what it is right now. seek therapy and work on yourself. Getting in shape can be a huge confidence boost for you which could help with feeling like she won\u2019t stick around. Lastly, You can\u2019t make someone stick around if they don\u2019t want to. Try to make her happy and do what she likes. Take her words for it and trust her.",

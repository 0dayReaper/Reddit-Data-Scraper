I have thought a lot on the suggestions that I\u2019ve been given and decided to go forward on some.\n\nI\u2019ve talked with my mother about the situation and she\u2019s agreed to take in my children until this situation is dealt with. I\u2019ve also approached my husband about divorced and put my demands about wanting full custody of our children as well as the house and other things. He hasn\u2019t put up a fight regarding any of those and has agreed to it. \n\nIt\u2019s been really hard into swallow all of this and I\u2019m looking for a lawyer now to help with the divorce. My mother has also suggested to keep the real reasoning of our divorce away from our children as long as possible, especially my eldest daughter (14).\n\nThis\u2019ll be my second and last post of this matter. I again want to express that I really appreciate all of the helpful comments and suggestions. Thank you all for the support. \u2764\ufe0f",

                            "comment": "Just wanted to clarify a few things. Custody is not the same as visitation. At least assuming this is the united states. \n\nOne parent having full custody does not deny the other parent time with the kids. \n\nLegal full custody would mean that OP makes all of the legal choices for the children. So doctors appoinments, medication approvals as needed, where they can or can't travel to out of the state, school enrollment,  and other things that may eventually pop up requiring them to have parental permission for something. \n\nWhen 2 parents share 50/50 custody both parents are required to come to an agreement regarding the above mentioned situations. Say parent 1 wants kids at school A. But parent 2 wants kids at school B. If they cannoy mutually agree to a school then it goes back to court and a determination is made with a mediator present or if it still can't be reached mutually they can revisit the custody agreement before a judge. \n\nNow visitation is a totally different ballfield. \n\nIf two parents have 50/50 custody that means that both parents (usually) have the same amount of visitation. So its a 50/50 split right down the middle and the children involved spend half their time with each. \n\nNow during a 50/50 custody agreement a parent can request less time with them but still retain 50% in decision making. A parent can also request more time with them. If its mutually agreed on then cool. If its not it would go back to court. \n\nNow, when one parent has 100% legal custody this only means that that specific parent is the only one legally entitled to make legal choices for the kids. When this is granted in court a mediator and the lawyers plus parents will decide upon a visitation schedule for the non custodial parent. \n\nA parent has the right to see their kids regardless as long as there is no documented abuse against those children or a court of law decides that the parent is unfit such as the case of drug abuse or neglect. \n\nA visitation schedule really comes down to what both parents agree on. Visitation can be a 50/50 split with only the custodial parent having the right to make medical choices. This would mean in the case of OP that if the kids were with dad and needed life saving medical treatment EMS would step in as needed and treatments would be approved by OP after she was notified of the emergency. Dad still has visitation, he just can't choose to stop life saving treatment or approve surgeries/etc. \n\nNow this would also mean that if dad has visitation but randomly decides to take the kids out of state without notifying OP, despite the visitation schedule it is legally parental kidnapping and a crime. \n\nIf they have 50/50 custody and he takes the kids out of state without OP knowing it is not parental kidnapping nor a crime as its in his legal rights. If he fails to return the kids to OP at the start of her visitation time its only failure to follow a visitation schedule. Lesser crime. And she will have a harder time getting the kids back. \n\n(I am NOT saying this will happen at all. I'm just using this as an example as Its a common reason why custody and visitation is split this way.)\n\nVisitation can also be less then a 50/50 split. The amount of time given is determined by the lawyers, parents, mediator and judge. \n\nFor example, When i was a child my mother had full legal custody of me. However, while my father had no legal right to decision making he did have a legal right to see me. His visitstion schedule was 3 months consecutively of the year. The parents may choose to break those days up or use them all at once as my father and mother lived in different states. So his visitation was usually an extended vacation for me as they both chose to do the 3 months in a row and occasionally trade off holidays so I got to spend time with each every other holiday cycle. If i wanted to see one parent during Anothers time they were legally allowed to let me do that and often did. So I visited my dad a lot more when I was really young then he was granted legally because my mom had no problem with me seeing him. \n\nIf OP is granted full/sole legal custody her soon to be ex husband won't be barred from ever seeing the kids again. The only legal way to do that is to have his parental rights terminated, which can only legally be done if 1) hes convicted of abuse against the kids to an extent that the kids are legally considered better off without him or 2) some one steps in to adopt the kids legally with his permission and he willingly signs his rights away. He cannot be forced to allow an adoption or to terminate his own rights. \n\nIts important to know the distinction between custody and visitation in legal terms as well as what that might mean moving forward. If his lawyer is a good one they will explain to the ex husband what his parental rights are and how he may choose to utilize them in the coming custody arrangement. He has to agree to whatever terms are presented or it'll be determined by a judge and that determination is what's in the kids best interest. Which is usually family reunification so they'll give him as much time as he wants as long as hes an active and good parent. \n\nBasically, as long as he wants to see them and isn't abusive to them OP can't legally withhold the kids or she could be arrested for contempt and other applicable charges. \n\nHe won't need custody to have visitation. Only if he wants a say in the legal decisions regarding the kids.\n\nThere are a lot of factors involved in making a visitation schedule and custody agreement so this is just the basic run down of what usually happens. Ultimately only the judge can finalize an agreement and the various stipulations it can hold for OP and her ex. But i just wanted to clarify that the ex, as shitty as he was to OP, isnt going to lose his right to see his kids over his actions since they were not towards the kids themselves. Its actually really hard to legally keep kids away from their parents. Even abuse cases can be, and often are, granted supervised visitation. \n\nWhat most often happens when one parent withholds kids from another is that the other parent doesn't want to fight it in court and lets it slide OR the other parent does not have the financial ability to fight it and doesn't have much of a choice in the matter. The courts themselves don't often terminate someone's rights and can only be done under very strict guidelines.\n\nTL:DR: Custody only means you make legal choices. You can have visitation without any custody. Having no custody does not stop you from legally seeing your kids. \n\nEdit: since it apparently needs to be said, i am not saying that the father in this post deserves no custody. I am clarifying what custody means legally and that he could obtain visitation  without custody if he chose to give up custody. Any legal proceedings regarding custody and visitation are between OP, the ex, the lawyers and a mediator or judge. I cannot decree who will get what in a custody battle.\n\nEdit 2: I am not a lawyer. I cannot tell you how to handle a legal case. I am just familiar with basic custody and visitation arrangements/rules.",

Now she wants to cut me out of the children\u2019s lives altogether so she can start a fresh new life with someone else. \n\nI have them half the time but there is ZERO coparenting on her end. I can\u2019t even call the kids when they are with her. It\u2019s been really really hard on me and my family. \n\n#BUT \n\nI NEVER say a negative thing about their mom in front of them. I\u2019ve had to sell things including my beloved Land Cruiser that I go camping in to cover the legal costs and the kids were upset about it. When they asked why I sold it I said, \u201cSo I can get a better one someday.\u201d instead of \u201cYour daddy is broke because mommy wants to take you away from me.\u201d\n\nNo matter how rough it is, a simple and positive answer is the best way to handle it when kids ask questions relating to divorces and splits. \n\nNever trash talk the other parent no matter how ugly it gets. All my friends that had divorced parents said that was the part that fucked them up the most so I never allow myself to even think about it.",

I've seen/known of that to happen. While you can control yourself and try with the OP, you can't control everyone else who's in contact with your children.\nI grew up with only my mom raising me and I do remember her saying a few negative things about my father, but not much. I do remember her saying that if it wasn't for me, they'd still be together....they were never really together. He was married at the time and apparently she took advantage of the fact that he had been drinking. His current wife had told me that (she's the mother of my father's oldest son's now ex wife, I know, crazy how both father and son married mother and daughter) and she knew us all before I was even born. I resented him all my life because he was never in it and always felt it was my fault he wasn't around. And I've lost both parents within a couple of years apart and didn't even know about my father's passing \nMy now ex has twin daughters who are in their early teens from a previous relationship and was hardly in their lives past their 2nd birthday until I pushed him to have that father/daughters relationship with them....come to find out back in December from him, his daughters want nothing to do with him. And this was exactly what I told him that I was trying to prevent from happening. I hadn't been with him for just over a year now, so I think he's either lying (comes naturally to him) or he started to slack on seeing them because I'm not around...won't be surprised if they resent him for not being around and hearing all the negative things from their mom's side.

But that it started so young, definitely feels like his cousin groomed him, and he\u2019s just kind of went with it. \n\nBut I don\u2019t know if he is an arsehole for coming clean, with their passing he has obviously realised how wrong he was too do it, but also probably how much they meant to him. \n\n\nHopefully he doesn\u2019t kill himself, and hopefully he goes on to find someone and doesn\u2019t have another cousin groom him into a relationship.\n\nE: I misread their ages back to front, but if he is telling the truth about \u201cbeing seduced\u201d then i think it still stands.

I think shutting them out completely will cause trust issues. If you want to keep the full truth from them, you may need to tell them *something* to avoid them going through a large part of this alone. But what you want to say is a choice you should make conscientiously. It sounds like the husband is trying to be reasonable, so maybe come up with what that you think is good to tell them, and get him to agree to the same message.\n\nSpeaking to a therapist about how to talk to the kids about this could be very useful. I would recommend you do this first to figure things out, and also to find a space to talk about the reality of how it will affect you and your family.\n\nI'm not a psychologist, but my personal choice would be to try to be as truthful as possible, but within the limits of what children can handle. Something like \"We don't want the same things any more, and we need to split up to try to be happy and take care of you kids well.\" When you inevitably get more questions, maybe something along the lines of \"Dad's cousin dying made him hurt a lot and made him realize he wasn't happy. He's trying to figure out how to be happy again, and we both want to do that separately.\" Given the circumstances, this may be more generous than he deserves, but it's possible that knowing it was their dad's fault could ruin their relationship with him. I don't feel sympathy for him on this, but for the kids: a bad relationship with their dad could cause them more psychological harm.\n\nThese are all difficult issues to navigate, and I'm not claiming to know what is the right way. Just hoping that the choice is made consciously rather than as a reaction to being put on the spot and nervous. I'm sorry you have to go through this, but you will get through this.",

But they are adult issues not children issues and that it didn\u2019t change the love we both had for them\u201d. \nAs it turned out, my husband blew his own cover, by how he was behaving when he was alone with the kids and I was at work. Our computer which was stationary was in the kitchen in plain sight and my daughter who is very inquisitive noticed part of the conversation and realized what was happening.  She straight up asked me if he was cheating on me and I reminded her that what we were going through were adult issues. So she asked him. He started telling her everything that he was in love with this woman and she was so good to him, that he was happy and that they should be happy for him and that he didn\u2019t love me anymore and that if I was a better wife he wouldn\u2019t have gone looking for it.\n\nI knew him to be a lot of things but didn\u2019t think he would stoop so low and involve our kids in his mess. He knew what I had told them and that\u2019s what he should\u2019ve stuck with but he was more interested in getting his side out there, than he was in sparing our kids from the ugly truth. As time went on he said many ugly things to them about me, and there were days when I wanted to just hit back, but chose not to.  I was not going to make myself feel better at their expense. \n\nThat and many of his other actions towards my kids eventually destroyed their relationship.  They are now adults and have nothing to do with him.  I take solace in the fact that that was his doing, not mine. And I stand by my statement, you never involve kids in adult issues\u2026 Ever.",

But by the time it happened, they had been seeing each other for like 7 or 8 years.\n\nIdk for sure how it ended up playing out, me and my ex broke up right after her stepsister and her brother had \"broken up\" (the way teenage couples always do). Add in the fact that they lived in DC, where the age of consent is 16, and the entire thing was a fucking mess.

I agree that she should not gaslight the kids and in my experience, kids catch on pretty quickly who messed up and the reasoning behind it.  I thought it sounded like her mother was just recommending that she wait until she had a better grasp of how to even approach the topic since undoubtedly upon news of the affair the kids are going to wonder who it was with.  \n\nNot sure of the age of her other children but the eldest (14YO) will already be at the age where she understands that her father\u2019s incestuous affair violates one of society\u2019s most sacred and guarded taboos.  I imagine finding out not only that their dad had an affair but that it was with his own cousin will elicit a profound and polarized reaction from them and it could have negative effects on their mental well-being.  \n\nI do think it needs to come out (I also think the father needs therapy ASAP as well as the wife and kids) but I understand waiting to share details with the kids until they\u2019re old enough to handle such a shocking revelation AND until the wife has come to terms with it and has figured out, hopefully with a therapist involved, how to go about breaking it to them.  It\u2019s an impossible situation and I appreciate parents who try to preserve their children\u2019s fleeting childhood innocence, too many people bad mouth their ex\u2019s and share adult things with their children which in turn forces the child to face harsh adult realities that they aren\u2019t prepared \u2014 mentally, emotionally, etc \u2014 to handle yet (not to mention how it very well could make the child feel removed from their peers as most of them likely won\u2019t have had to deal with such a heavy topic (I don\u2019t mean an affair, I mean the incest)).  \n\nAnyhoo, that\u2019s my two cents.  The whole situation breaks my heart.  Wishing the OP a resilient spirit, hope, and all the support she needs \u2014 as well her children and her soon to be ex \u2014 during her process of trying to move on with life.  Can\u2019t imagine.",

A couple doesn't owe it to anyone to divulge the personal issues that ended their relationship.\n\nMy ex-husband cheated and my kids were (boy) 8 years and (girl)15 months. I've never told either of them why because their dad was repentant and begged me not to tarnish their image of him. The only reason I would have for telling them would be out of spite. I forgive him since it doesn't matter now that we've split and I don't want revenge at the expense of my children's relationship with their father.\n\nIt isn't for them to know the reason we divorced, all they need to know is that we both love them and we coparent extremely well and are friends outside of coparenting. If I had gone against his wishes, we would not have the good relationship that we do now and they might resent him for making bad choices he's since corrected (he also stopped drinking which led to the cheating and poor decision making). So in my view, what would be the point of telling them?",

I was also raised in an isolated environment and my only other friend at the time his parents were both alcoholics so they didn't do anything too different from my own parents except drink. \n\nI'm not saying you got to open the arc of the covenant for your children and reveal the horrors of humanity, but what you should do is clearly explain at a minimum something to the tune of that your relationship is ending, because dad broke his promise to mom. And because it was part of the promise that was made for the marriage it has to be dissolved now, because promises are important to keep.\n\nYou could maybe even let them know it was about cheating, I would leave the fact of it being about the cousin though out until their mid to late twenties.",

But my current partner broke down over it and told me that it really stressed her out and scared her. I had never even been mad in those arguments, I just felt that I was supposed to enjoy arguing with people, it was a real perception shift to see someone so hurt by what I had said. Not that I ever made any personal attacks aside from a general disregard of a valid point in order to keep the argument going. \n\nI would start arguments as often as possible, I would play devil's advocate for the sake of a debate. I would just state unpopular opinions gauge a reaction and then take the opposing side. \n\nI told myself that engaging in debate is a good way to communicate because it allows you to bounce ideas off of each other, right or wrong, well thought out or half-baked arguing a position is a good way to train reactionary critical thinking skills. \n\nBut see, I've been literally screamed at for most of my life, (1-25 now older ) most every conversation I ever had about anything was an uphill struggle for me. The best I could ever hope for realistically was a respectful, even debate or maybe a discussion about theoretical topics that had no right or wrong answers to compare. \n\nMy partner had a normal life, her parents were \"strict\" but, like, they were clearly way easier on their kids than mine were on me. Which, I think is great, clearly being hard on me did me no favors long term. \n\nGetting in a heated debate randomly in the middle of the day or late into the evening was not something that was ever normalized for her. Especially not multiple times a week, sometimes multiple times a day. \n\nNowadays we rarely argue, to begin with we were of the same opinion on most all topics. When we do argue I make sure to simply navigate it as carefully as possible, as I investigate the best way to solve it as quickly and peacefully as possible. \n\nWe had other issues as well, and it's not as if I am to blame for everything either. This was just one of the things I remember being especially shocking to me personally, and it's something that makes me really double think what I do and say going forward. \n\nAnother one was when I realized I hate Christmas music because it gives me anxiety lol.",

He lied for this long. Did you know him well? (At least you think you knew?) Was it in or out of character to learn of this fact? How well did you know his cousin?  Knowing both of their character, how much of his story do you think is true?\n\nWhat really bothers me is this:\n- He told you at all, he knew it would be controversial because he sent the kids away. He had nothing positive to get out of this. \n- He is going along with divorce proceedings without fighting on something that cannot be proven.\n\nWith no sign of anger, it's someone who knew they've been screwing up for a long time and realised the day of judgement would come. And they were at peace with it. Why didn't he succeed in stopping?\n\nHe admitted of his mistakes. Unless there's ulterior motive, it shows growth.\nI still can't get past why he would tell you everything and take the punishment willingly unless he has already been wracked by guilt forever and he never wanted it to be that way. \n\nI would need way more info (like was he even a good dad/husband) before throwing everything to the wind. There is a lot of unpacking to do. Did you still love him before this? Did he show love to you? Did you ever suspect anything? I wonder what's in the cousin's will. That could explain a lot?\n\nI mean maybe he's been a true asshole to you and your kids this whole time. Can't be fixed. But if there was nothing wrong up to then, as far as you know, to you or the kids, and out of the blue he wrecks it all to come clean? \n\nI've been cross at my kids for hiding their mistakes. But I've been pretty disappointed when they've made them over and over despite our warnings, and they hide them because they don't want to be told off for making them. I understand that. I want them to come and tell me they made a mistake as a kid, and we fix it. I still resent them for not learning fast enough. I shouldn't. Accidents happen. They happen to me even now. \n\nTo make a mistake that will follow you your whole life, it sometimes only takes a few seconds. You drive after a drink once. You try a cigarette once. \nYou dive in a swimming pool without checking if it has water first. It doesn't take much to blackmail someone these days. I understand that and if people learned, I could forgive. Nobody in infallible. People do grow, especially since leaving teenagehood. \n\nWhy do I bother, nobody will ever read this!",

It is not perverted to like a teenage girl if you are a underage teen you act like he was 30 they are now 40 and 37-38 and I don\u2019t like incest but I don\u2019t think he preys on young children he was a child",

Divorce or no divorce, wait until your children are adults to have a frank discussion of what happened. Kids need to know their parents love them and that they are safe, above every single hurt feeling you or he may have. That\u2019s the advice of a kid of divorced parents who took this tack, and I\u2019ve always felt secure in their love because of it. Kids don\u2019t need to know the terrible details of your marriage.",

And, all you have to tell the children is that both you and their father love them and will protect them, that adults may fall out of love with each other but they don't fall out of love with their children.  Remember that the children likely see themselves as coming 1/2 from mom and 1/2 from dad - tearing down dad can hurt them.",

    "postText": "I want to be somewhat vague to not give away my situation too much\n\nI was living on my own for about four years until recently, I want to move to a state to get a job i want, but I will have to foot the bill to get there. It's also an expensive city, so I thought that moving in with my folks to save a couple months worth of rent would be worth it\n\nBut man, a month in and it's already driving me insane. I just can't stand to be around my mom. It seems like she is always wanting to talk, show me photos of stuff, ask how my night was, always wants to cook for me, etc. She said after I moved in I put life into the house because her and my step dad were home bodies and never got out, so she started cooking more and stuff, which good for her, but I also kinda feel like she's being a leech off me\n\nIf I walk in the room and they are watching TV, she will make my step dad pause the TV to talk with me. And I don't always want to talk. I kinda want to have it be more of a roommate situation where I can maintain some autonomy\n\nI know typing out what my mom does makes me sound unappreciative but holy shit, it's like she's clingy. I just want her to leave me alone.\n\nShe recently took my niece on a trip and was gone for a few days and I had a great time with my step dad just being chill\n\nHow do I convey this to my mom to not be all over me? I don't want to come off like I don't like her, I mean I don't like how she's behaving, but holy shit man. If she wasn't family and was acting like this I would get a restraining order\n\nI want so badly to just ditch my plans and go back to living alone and just figure it out instead of doing this. I dread leaving my bedroom, or God forbid I cook something in the kitchen and my mom will hold me hostage while I'm trying to meal prep\n\nAm I making sense? I feel overwhelmed and kinda all over the place. If you've been in a similar situation I'd appreciate any guidance, or even if you haven't been\n\nThank you",

Moms can be so happy when their kids are around so her constant need to talk to you could just be excitement. So if your mom is someone you trust and love then just be honest with her in a gentle way.",

    "postText": "I got to know to really know a coworker after meeting him in April he\u2019s a super shy goth guy who keeps to himself and one day I decided to offer him a ride home since it was a cold night and found out we had a lot in common and just had so much fun with him. We hanged out more for extremely long hrs just laughing and really bonding. He eventually made the first move and said he felt like he was meant to meet me and was so gentle and sweet to me obviously it made my heart melt. Then his grandmas funeral came up and he was super cold and distant afterwards which I completely understand because she seemed to be a close part in his life. So I didn\u2019t push to do anything romantically with him but told him I\u2019d be there for anything to he needed and he could rely on me which he appreciated. \n\n    Eventually I started getting him out more because he said it wasn\u2019t doing him well being in his room everyday. So I was planning days out taking him to pretty beaches and buying him food. And while he seemed so sad he would still kiss me but became persistent on wanting to have sex but for me it was too soon which I told him and I like a guy to actually really want me before I would ever have sex with him. As we started hanging out more it always seemed like he was expecting to have sex and well it ended up happening because although I tried to change the topic and tell him I felt like that wasn\u2019t what he needed he still wanted to have sex and promised me he wasn\u2019t going to just toy around with me and so I gave him trusting that maybe I just needed to be more fun and we could still end up together. I had planned a date to go see the new Spider-Man that Friday it was out and to do some fun things in his interest I did a lot of research to find a place and well he cancelled which I was understanding of.                \n\nThen I seen him at work the day before what was supposed to be our plans and he sweetly told me hi and he has such a cute smile I thought we were still fine but I he didn\u2019t respond to my message and then I see him two days later at work and he\u2019s completely avoiding eye contact with me and acting like I didn\u2019t exist and now it\u2019s been 2 weeks since I\u2019ve heard from him or have even been acknowledged from him at work. \n\nI still really don\u2019t understand and he didn\u2019t leave me an explanation or anything and I\u2019m extremely sad because I still care about him and I feel like I seen a really heartwarming side of him. Does anyone know why anyone would do this because I keep questioning if i did something to push him away when I just wanted him to feel cared for and seen :/",

But he told me it was really good and said I was like a lion and did a little purr that we laughed a lot about. And yeah he fell asleep on my chest and said he got the best sleep so yeah I thought we were going to be good since we were compatible in that. But I think that\u2019s all he wanted even though he told me it wasn\u2019t",

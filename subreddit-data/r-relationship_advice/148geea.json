    "postText": "My boyfriend and I have been together for 6 years and lived together for 4 of those years. We\u2019ve always split bills and rent evenly. When I was in college living off of student loans, we split everything evenly. He would treat me to a few dinners here and there, but everything was usually split right down the middle.\n\nA little about him, he has no debt, his parents paid for his entire college, and gifted him their car (it\u2019s not super swanky, but it\u2019s reliable etc.). \n\nA little about me, I have not had much financial help at all from my family, I lease my own car and have student debt that I am slowly paying off. \n\nWe now live in a state where the cost of living is very expensive. In the last two years each of our careers have gone in different paths. Because I recently graduated, I was working at an entry level hourly job where I was making  50k for 1.5 years, and then worked my ass off and was internally hired for another position at 70k. I was only in the new position for about 6 months when I was abruptly laid off in December 2022. I had a severance package and was collecting unemployment while actively job searching, and not once did I ask him to pay for more bills or rent etc. I landed a new job after 3+ months of job searching, and this job pays 55k a year, yet the insurance and benefits aren\u2019t as great as my previous role, so I am paying more out of pocket for those as well. \n\nFor some background, when I was promoted to the 70k job we moved to a nicer apartment and our rent nearly doubled. At the time, this was at the absolute top of my budget. Now, this rent is 50% of my monthly income. \n\nMy partner is EXTREMELY good to me. He cooks and cleans a lot and he lets me have some of his meals that he makes (I\u2019ll have like one piece of chicken and then use my own ingredients to make a salad etc. we shop separately when it comes to groceries). He also makes 110k+ a year. He makes more than double what I make. He\u2019s able to save a lot of money because he doesn\u2019t have car payments or student loans like I mentioned. \n\nI recently let him know that my job is pretty rough financially, and that it\u2019s much harder to pay for basic things than I thought it would be. I wouldn\u2019t have taken this job if i wasn\u2019t laid off. I asked if he could pay $100-$200 extra a month for rent because it would really help me. I only am asking him to pay a couple extra hundred per month for rent until i can get some sort of promotion, and I am actively doing everything I can to move up/ get promoted/get a raise. He\u2019s telling me to just \u201cwork hard and get another job\u201d and that \u201ci\u2019m asking for a handout\u201d and that \u201c$200 won\u2019t really make a difference it\u2019s not that much money\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s really frustrating and he\u2019s insisting that we pay 50/50 because it\u2019s only fair. I feel like he\u2019s treating me like a roommate and not his girlfriend that he\u2019s been with for 6 years. For context, we are very committed and have discussed marriage, his parents see me as their daughter in law already. The emotional aspect of this almost hurts more, and I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nHow do you recommend that I approach this topic with him so he understands? I just want him to see my side and pay a couple extra hundred a month for rent.\n\nEdit: When I said state I meant a physical location, not like a mental state or way of life lol! We moved states after I graduated during the pandemic\n\nEdit 2: I want to add again that he is very very good to me emotionally. He treats me with unconditional love and has always supported me (emotionally). He is very thoughtful. He also pays for dinners sometimes, we\u2019ll go out to dinner like twice a month or so. I buy him treats and lunches as well. He also will stock up on necessities like toilet paper and paper towels and only asks me to pay him for those sometimes. I recognize that he is incredibly good to me, but he is very conservative with his money.\n\nedit 3: we shop separately because we have different diets, I eat a lot less food than him and he travels a lot so many of his meals he also eats out while traveling, but he cooks dinners when he\u2019s home and i share some of them with him.\n\nEdit 4 and an update: \n\nI want to address all the \u201cyou\u2019re just a roommate he sleeps with\u201d comments. From an outside perspective, this may look this way. However, we have been together for six years, my family loves him, I am very close with his family, we have agreed we want to marry eachother and have children. We support eachother through every life change and big event (except for apparently this one). This particular issue is hurting me emotionally because it seems that he doesn\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to have a financial burden, based on his financial history he may not be able to empathize with my situation and therefor doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal. Of course this is a major issue. I talked to him this morning and he said he would consider paying a little more for rent if I would cook and clean more, as he does the majority of the cooking and cleaning right now. There is a lot more to discuss because the issue is larger than just that, but I want to thank everyone for their input as it\u2019s been really helpful.\n\n**Latest update:**\n\nHe\u2019s on the road traveling for work and called me, we talked through things and we decided that I\u2019d put together a spreadsheet of all my expenses and my income etc, and from there we\u2019d decide how much he\u2019ll pay to help with rent. Thanks again for all the help, I brought up a lot of points and concerns that were listed in the comments that I aligned with and he seemed to better understand. I also expressed I\u2019d be happy to cook and clean more as he felt he was pulling a lot of the weight in this realm and I recognize that. I also asked what his plans were with him saving so much money every month (while I struggle), and he said he aggressively saves with his 401k so we can retire comfortably in the future. While this is thoughtful, I expressed that we also have to think about the present and the health of our relationship today, this also resonated with him.",

First off, if she finds this completely unacceptable that he would be unwilling to help her out more with rent she should consider ending the relationship. But if not, she needs to tell him that when the lease is up she'll be moving to an apartment that she can afford...either with or without him.

                            "comment": "You have to think also beyond this moment in this situation. If he is this strict about finances now, how will things look in the future? Are you going to have kids? Are you going to go 50/50 on diapers? How will you do that if you are home with the kids? What if you found out you had cancer tomorrow and couldn't work for a year? So many different scenarios.\n\nI definitely don't think either party should pay for things fully or to let themselves be taken advantage of, but after 6 years together he isn't willing to float you a little for a couple months while you get back on track from setbacks that were no fault of your own? That's pretty unreasonable to me. You mentioned that he even said something like \"it's only 200$ it won't make much of a difference even.\" If it's really that little of a deal to him and a meaningless amount, then why would he even hesitate to help out? It's not like you are asking to quit your job to freeload and sit at home and paint your nails all day while he works 3 jobs to support you. I know you said he is good to you in many other ways but this would be a huge red flag for me and I don't know that I would be willing to marry and have children with someone like this. It's not even the money aspect of it.. it's just the fact that he is unwilling to help with something he admitted would be such a little deal to him, but would make a huge difference in your life and well being. It shows that we aren't a team in his eyes... we are together sure, but still separate and that has scary implications for me down the road if I have children, get sick, or am unable to work for any reason. No matter what the sex or gender of each person, or who is what in the relationship, any person who could be spending their money freely, indulging in whatever, living the somewhat high-life, putting money in savings accounts etc. while the person they claim to love Is struggling to even pay their rent and bills is pretty wack in my opinion. That's your partner... when you struggle, you struggle together. When you're up, you're supposed to be up together. What if things get worse for you and you start falling behind on things even more and it gets to the point where you are not even able to afford your own groceries anymore? Is he gonna be eating steak and lobster while you are making KD and ramen everynight? \n\nSomething a lot of couples do nowadays is split finances 50/50 but according to their income. That way you are both paying 50 percent of your income, not 50 percent of the bills. So you open a shared account, and every month, you put in 50 percent of your income and he puts in 50 percent of his income. You then use that to pay bills and rent and all those things that are for you as a couple. You then use your remaining income how you see fit. So for example, if he's making 10k a month and you are making 5k a month, he would be putting 5k into the joint account and you would be putting 2.5k into the joint account. Money that is left over or if a larger balance accumulates can then be spent on joint ventures or items. Like if you need a new washer and dryer, or mattress.. or want to take a trip to Mexico. This way, you both are contributing half of your wages and it is fair. If you are both working full time, then it shouldn't be your fault that you are making less at the moment. You aren't working any less than your spouse. Who knows in the future you may be the higher earner. I'm sure then he will not be happy with the plan you guys have now. It would he unfair to him, I'm sure.",

If $200 wouldn't make a difference and it's not that much money, why can't he just pay it then, hm? Does he think you're stupid? He's seriously going to ask you to magically increase your salary, get another job when even he himself is struggling in the job market right now, and clutch his $200 while also telling you it's not a lot of money? No, this is not a man who actually views you as an equal partner. I cannot imagine someone treating their partner of 6 YEARS like this. I cannot fathom how he can get to save so much money while watching someone he claims to love and want to marry struggle.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 makes more than double what I do. We have ALWAYS split everything proportionally to income. And he's conservative with his money too. But he loves me and wants to be fair to me. It is more important to him that I am comfortable and happy so we can enjoy our time together. He wouldn't want to watch me struggle while he gets to save a ton of money. To him, his money he works very hard for is for making life easier for the BOTH of us because we are life partners and a team. What is love and partnership for if not lifting each other up and increasing each other's quality of life by being together? Wanting to see each other happy and thriving?\n\nI think you should take a long hard look at your relationship and if this is the person you want to marry. You've got some good suggestions here about suggesting a cheaper apartment that you can actually afford 50% of the rent, but I think that might just be a bandaid solution to the money problem in your relationship. I really can't believe he said those things to you.... that would absolutely be giving me pause in the relationship. I wish you well xx",

Why even be in a relationship if you don't give a shit if your partner is constantly stressed over money?",

You can help out around the house more and see if that'll change your bfs mind about paying for expenses proportionally. The division of labor in the household is already disproportionate, splitting rent 50/50 is probably the last thing your bf is holding onto.",

It's relative, and he isn't able to see through your frame of reference. A third party may be able to help him see that this is a more serious and overarching issue between you: you are expressing a need, and he is dismissing it as a want. You need his help, the way he would need your help if he was sick or injured. This mindset isn't necessarily a character flaw, it's a family culture issue.",

His money is his, his choices sound like he is trying to help you out with other things while still maintaining the agreed amount of an even split.\n\nWhen someone makes a large amount more than the other, it can cause issues where the higher earner is *expected* to spend more. If that's the relationship you're looking for, you may not find it with him.\n\nIt sounds like he is attached to the amount of money he earns from his hard work. It sounds like you'd like to be back at the place where you're earning enough to do similar things as him.\n\nYou've also stated that you now pay 50% of your take home pay to rent. I'm not sure where you live, but in canada that's pretty much the housing industry right now. There are people paying 60+% towards rent. So take a look at other places to get a better understanding of what'd be like to live on your own/downgrading with him\n\nBut ultimately, he isn't obligated to spend any more than what was agreed to(50%) and if that is an issue, you don't have to stay.\n\nFinances are one of the biggest reasons for breakups and divorces.

It can be the main reason people break up or divorce. \n\nHe thinks you\u2019re asking for a handout and to just pull up your bootstraps and work 4 jobs. It\u2019s ironic he thinks you\u2019re asking for a handout when he\u2019s directly profiting off of those handouts from his parents. \n\nAnd it\u2019s ignorant to say $200 doesn\u2019t make a difference. He makes $9100 a month and you $4500. $200 impacts his monthly income by 2.2% and impacts you 4.44%. That\u2019s double. If he\u2019s not willing to shift 2% of his income to ease your hardship, you\u2019re in for a tough time moving forward. \n\nLet\u2019s say your bills are $3k/month. With you paying 50% at $1500/month, that is 33% of your monthly income of $4500. Even when you made $70k, it\u2019s still 25% of your income. His 50% is 16.5% of his monthly income of $9100. You\u2019re being screwed over financially in my eyes.\n\nYou need to scale down your rent to live within your means. They suggest spending 30% of your annual income on housing, which is about $1375/month. He can afford $2750/month. He needs to stick within your budget if he doesn\u2019t want you to take any \u201chandouts\u201d. \n\nYou need to decide if you want to be married to someone who views and manages finances like he does. He is not going to change. What happens when you have to stay home for weeks after giving birth? Will you still be \u201cliable\u201d for rent and bills?\n\nI personally would not tolerate his style of managing finances. It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s good to you if you can\u2019t afford to live.",

You're a team, and you should be working towards the same goal. Have a chat about your future and what his expectations are for money when you're married or have kids, and I think that conversation will be quite telling in how long he's expecting you to struggle for. \n\nAlso, him being able to have savings is literally profiting of your sacrifice.

            "comment": "I don't understand how you can say he's good to you emotionally when he is making a choice to inflict emotional suffering on you. It isn't just that he won't help- personally I think thats an asshole move in such a situation but I can understand it. Berating you for \"asking for a handout\" is the opposite of offering support. I get he might not understand the stress such a lack of security places on you. However, you've literally told him you aren't doing well. At this point he's making a conscious choice to not only not help you, but to kick you while you are down.\n\nI hope your spreadsheet goes well but something tells me it won't. People who go that out of their way not to empathize will always be looking for what they are getting out of every deal. Thats made even more clear by you cleaning more, especially if he is the one who wants the upgraded housing. Things are fine when things are well. Just don't lose your job and don't get a chronic or life threatening disease. He will drop you like that. Hes already told you exactly how he will act. \n\nThe things you listed where he treats you well are primarily monetary things. Do they really mean much when they require little sacrifice? If he travels for work he obviously isn't doing cooking/cleaning for you all of the time. Maybe its less lopsided than you think. I do agree you should do more household responsibilities if you generally have more time, it just leaves a sour taste after his outburst.\n\nWhy arent you married? What are you waiting for? I ask because its pertinent whether the waiting is primarily due to you or him. Im of the personal belief that you should have a solid idea whether you want to get married by 5 years. Im suspicious of people who push it past that because it indicates to me that they dont really want to get married. Ive seen more than a few friends and family members get misled by men I knew never intended to marry them. Some got engaged but never set a wedding date and later finally broke up.\n\nYou already live together. What would marriage change? Potentially kids though even that can be planned to occur down the road or happen without it. It would primarily change your finances. A lot of young men have figured this out. They get the benefit of cheaper rent and free, accessible sex and none of the risk that comes from comingling finances. Theyll \"discuss\" it for years and never do it.\n\nI'm way more petty though. Id be showing him how much he'd be paying on his own and how much cash he'd lose when he can't convince another woman to take him, as I was walking out the door. A no would have been salvageable. Going off on you about being a freeloader makes it very clear what he thinks of you and other people who have unfortunate events in their lives. Personally id want someone I could trust would be there during an unfortunate event. Not someone who would immediately assume I was being a lazy freeloader even when they are exposed to how stressed I was. The nice things he does are easy things he knows partners generally do to woo each other. When it comes to actually being supportive, he's failing.",

Does he agree to an option right away, or ask for time and comes back with the option that works best in his mind?\n\nOr does he give you a difficult time and insist you both stay where you\u2019re at now?\n\nThis will tell you the kind of long-term partner he is. \n\nSure, it\u2019s great that he\u2019s nice and buys the toilet paper.

    "postText": "I've got this crush on this friend of mine for a couple months now, but I'm not sure how I should go around it. The thing is, we are both from the same class, same building, same group of friends, same kind of humor and do really well together, but I dont think she sees me as a potential relashionship. I would say the two biggest challenges are that I'm 22 and shes 29, shes been single at least from the start of uni, 4 years now, with a lot of guys hitting on her along the way, so its not like shes interested in dating anyone, but, from what we talk about, she isnt closed to it either. So cutting the story short, I've got a crush on a classmate/bestfriend/same building/see everyday kind of person, thats also not very interested in relashionships and 7 years older, so probably sees me as a kid (I would probably), although we hit it off pretty well, got similar senses of humor and are pretty like minded. Regarding apearences, I would say shes got me beat, Im probably a 6 while shes a 8, and from what we joke, its more likely that her type is a bald professor than a 22 yearold lol. But here's the thing, I've also decided life is too short to regret not saying things, so, I'm lost at the part where I decide how to do it.  \nTo add a bit more context, shes not much of a party person, even less than me, I'm on Brazil and our friendship has reached a level we can joke around most stuff and share most of our lifes problems and whatever. I dont think I've got a shot at this, but, you probably know how dumb people in love get, with hopping and seing signals where there arent any. My goal in this telling her how I fell thing is to be able to let her know that I'm love with her but still preserve the most I can about our friendship. I'm divided between just blurping it all out and tell her how I feel, or try something more subtle like flirting (more than I casualy do). The problem with the flirting option is, one, I'm bad at it, two, I worry that she would only take as a joke and not get the I'm in love with you part.  \nAs for declaring my love (lol), how should I go around it?  \n1- Wait for a party we both go and, before we start drinking come up to her and be like, so, you are probably going to want kill me, but, I fell in love with you, dont want to ruin the friendship we got but also couldnt keep it as a secret either  \n2- Same as option one, but after drinking.  \n3- Invite her to a date casually and hoping it works (hard, she would probebly say shes busy and we would all pretend it didnt happen, and then I would still not be sure she was actually busy and if she understood the point of the date. (I've invited her to hang out before, without underlying reasons)  \n4- Invite her a date insisting that I have something important to discuss, go to a coffee shop and to her about it.  \n5- Joke around and make insinuations, flirt?  \n6- Casually drop in a conversation I like her, as I didnt have any hope of her feeling the same way (probably the way im doing it if nobody helps me)  \n7- So, my friend group kind of comprises of a lot of people, but the two closest are the crush and another girl im friends with, as for her, I would say her two closest people are this other girl firned of mine and another girl (I'm also friends whith, but she wouldnt be impartial between the two of us). This friend we have in commom would actually be impartial in this matter, so I could ask for her advice, the downside is, one, I would want to keep this just between me and the crush, two, I'm kind of afraid she will just advise me not to say anything because I wouldnt have a chance (probably would be right)  \nAs you can see, I've put way too much thought into this... If you think you got any usefull insight, do share!",

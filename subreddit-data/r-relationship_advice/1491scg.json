    "postText": "2 months ago I met this guy who's amazing, loving and caring. And who in the beginning of the year ended a long-term relationship. We have the same humor, he initiates all the dates and everything's great. However, due to my past experiences and also some of the things we've discussed, I'm a bit nervous if he sees us together in a long run. He's not dating anyone else, has admitted he likes me, talks with me all the day but isn't giving any promises and sees that let's just see where this goes. Which has forced me to start pushing him, being overly touchy, sweet and caring, and now he's saying we're having tensions since I bring up this topic quite often.\n\n  \nI fully understand his POV but I really like him and want him to confirm that we're going to be together in the future as well. Actually, not only to confirm this but to make him feel this way. How can I make him sure about us?",

If he\u2019s not ready to commit, maybe you should think about dating others. As long as you two aren\u2019t in a committed relationship both of you are free to see other people at any time. I wouldn\u2019t recommend having sex with him or any others you date yet. You seem to catch feelings real quick.  (Us females are more likely to do that)So take things slow and friendly.",

Tricky one.   \nWhile your concerns are as valid as his, you have to reflect if you are on the same page on this, which it seems you are not. \n\nYou can't get him to commit, truth is. Only he can decide that. \n\nAlso, one concerning point: Why do you want a guy you only met for two months commit so quickly? \n\n I think you need to work a bit on yourself as well on this chapter.",

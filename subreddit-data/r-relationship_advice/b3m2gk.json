First off, I want to apologize for not responding to every single post reply or PM. I am genuinely touched by the sheer amount of support I received and I spent quite a few hours crying my eyes out as I read your messages and well wishes.\n\nThe night after I wrote my original post, I wrote my wife a short letter (thank you /u/Witchy_Woman420 for the idea) that went something like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cDear \\[Wife\u2019s name\\],\n\nI love you more than you can imagine and the most I want in this world is for you to be happy. I understand that as a man I probably have no idea how intense the pain that you are feeling is. I\u2019m doing my best to help you but the fact that you won\u2019t help yourself is taking a toll on our marriage. I honestly cannot continue living like this for much longer and our marriage is in jeopardy if you don\u2019t make an effort to get better. However, I want to get over this bump together and start working in the right direction together. I\u2019m ready to talk whenever you are.\n\nWith all my love,\n\n\\[My name\\]\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI put the letter on top of her laptop and went to bed. The next morning (March 16th), I woke up a bit earlier than usual to fix her a double helping of her favorite breakfast: blueberry pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs, and fresh squeezed OJ. When I walked into the bedroom with her food, I saw her reading my letter. When she saw me, she put the letter down, got out of bed, threw herself into my arms, and started crying. Full on, Niagara Falls level crying. I hugged her tighter, told her \u201cI love you so, so, much\u201d, and started crying too. I honestly don\u2019t know how long we stood there hugging each other and crying. It could\u2019ve been 10 minutes, it could\u2019ve been an hour, I didn\u2019t care. When she stopped crying, she promised me that she would go to therapy. Reddit, you guys don\u2019t know how thrilled and proud I was when I heard those words. She then asked me if we could go on a trip to Japan because in her words \u201cI really need to leave this fucking house for once and get some fresh air.\u201d\n\nI was so fucking proud of her when she took the initiative in planning our trip. She\u2019s always been a methodical, organized person and as she booked the flights and hotels I saw in her eyes the same spark that made me fall in love with her 8 years ago. We just finished packing for the trip and she fell asleep with the faintest of smiles on her face not too long ago. We have a 5AM Uber to catch, a trip to enjoy, and both therapy and dog-shopping sessions lined up when we return.\n\nWe\u2019re not quite out of the tunnel yet, but we can see the light at the end.\n\nEDIT: I'm going to bed. Thank you to everyone who followed my story and offered their well wishes.",

                            "comment": "where are you going in Japan? I just finished a 3 month trip and I want to give advice!\n\nI don't know what you like, but the most special places I went to were:\n\n - [Saihoji](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3937.html) (a.k.a. Kokedera), a temple in Kyoto whose grounds are a forest of moss and it's more beautiful than you can imagine. It's a bit hard to gain entrance, though. It may be too late for you if you're leaving so soon, since you need an advance booking.\n\n - Okinawa, which is ordinary *until the moment you go snorkeling over one of the reefs* .... oh my god is it beautiful beyond reckoning to have so many rainbow fish of every type swirling around you. Personally I went to the reef 30 feet from the beach at Tokashiki Island and it was amazing.\n\n - Dotonburi in Osaka. You've probably never seen anything like this place. I certainly never had and I have been to many cities. Picture Times Square stretched out along a river. It's very very special at night.\n\n - Himeji Castle in Himeji. Just an astonishing castle, one of the greatest the world has ever seen. The architecture is breathtaking.\n\n**edit**: since this caught some attention: For Saihoji, you need to send a letter requesting entrance. It's not expensive, maybe $30 (which was actually literally the most expensive thing I did in Japan, most of their national treasures are like $5), and they send you back a response by mail. So you have to do it very in advance. [Here are the details on how the letter request works.](http://saihoji-kokedera.com/en/reservation.html) And if you visit it, please for the love of god be quiet while you're inside.\n\nIf you go to Okinawa, DROWN yourself in sunscreen. Have someone help you so you don't miss any spots, especially on your back if you're snokeling facedown. I cannot say this enough. If you saw my back after snorkeling without suncreen you would never forget such a horrible sight. yes i am very stupid.\n\nThat said, here are some other personal highlights I'll mention aside from the four listed above:\n\n - Yakushima Island, the inspiration for the scenery in Princess Mononoke, is gorgeous if you like hiking. This isn't for everyone, because you have to specifically set aside time and money just to fly out to this island. But if you love hiking and remote places, well....the scenery [is really something.](https://www.google.com/search?q=yakushima&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS823US823&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdityP0JThAhVULX0KHbG2DCcQ_AUIDygC&amp;biw=1265&amp;bih=647) By the way, the trails are somewhat strenuous with some very steep portions.\n\n - Nara, the town where deer are tame. This town is crazy. It's a 45 minute train ride from Kyoto and it's lovely on its own, but its defining feature is the hundreds upon hundreds of deer that just freely walk through the streets and into the shops. It's insane and such an interesting experience.\n\n - Kyoto has a *lot* of temples, it's hard to express just how many there are. More than you can see without spending a month in Kyoto alone. Some of Kyoto's famous tourist spots actually aren't that great, like the Arashiyama Bamboo grove or the Golden Temple of Kinkakuji, but the Fushimi Inari shrine trail of gates was really interesting and a lesser known temple called Ryoanji has gorgeous gardens. It's best known for its rock garden (doesnt interest me) but its actual gardens are really something in the summer. I saw Nijo Castle and the Imperial Palace grounds too, also pleasant places. Truthfully Kyoto can burn you out on gardens.\n\n - My friend who I traveled with insists I mention Beppu, whose hot springs she enjoyed. I was bored.\n\n",

Even though I CAN have kids, I'm planning on adopting the second when we come to that point in our family. Having my own child is a blessing, but pregnancy is hard and birth was traumatizing. Family doesn't have to be biologically related! I'd love my adopted child just as much as my own! It pains me that there are children who don't have parents to hold them when they cry, feed them when they're hungry, laugh with them when they're happy, play with them, and nurture them. \n\nJust to clarify that not everyone has a bad pregnancy and birth experience, but mine was pretty less than ideal and if I can give a child in need a nurturing and loving home to grow up in, I would in a heartbeat.",

You don't deal with a depressed spouse by threatening to leave them  if they don't get over something. WTF. I'm glad she apparently \"got over it\" so quickly or is at least helping herself, but having been married 20 years, this hints at the reality that they don't have staying power.   \nWhat happens when she gets really down about it again when she hits a new age? What happens when her friends start having more babies that she can't and she gets down again? Is he just going to threaten to leave each time?  \n\n\nMarriage isn't supposed to be so easily disposable. Through thick and thin. She's in the thick of it and he  threatens to leave her? Nah, bruh. To me that's seriously fucked up.",

And after reading this letter, his wife just somehow, magically, overcomes her depression and flings herself into his arms and has a cathartic cry.\n\nNot to mention just the extraneous, unnecessary storytelling details on this post that comes across as cliche and overly sweet. \n\nCome on.

This is not how infertility affects couples, this isn't how it happens, it's not for Roy learn to move on etc.  You are not happy with dogs, a trip, or adoption.  These are just tools to divert your strength and help move on. They are not cures. ",

Yes it's a wonderful option but it's not for everyone. It also doesn't cure infertility  the couple still has a right to grieve.  Please don't tell people to just adopt. It's not that easy it is expensive and time consuming roller coaster.   Google \"just adopt\" if you don't believe me. ",

    "postText": "Long post ahead. Please excuse any grammatical errors. \n\nI (M27) know my wife for 12 years (F27). We met when we were 15, fell in love, and grew up together. She is the love of my life and I can't imagine my daily life without her. We also recently got married, 6 months ago. Both of us live far apart, I, west coast and she, mid west and have been for the past five years since we go to different universities for our higher studies. \n\nI have graduated recently and start a job soon, while my wife is expected to complete in about 1.5 years. My company is in the Bay area and rent, as you know is extremely high. My options are, to take a 1bed/1bath alone or share a 2bed/2bath with someone else. I realized that I could be saving at least a few hundred dollars every month if I choose option 2 and share with someone - only problem that I had to find someone to share the room with. I must say I was apprehensive about adjusting to a new flatmate and also about the whole process of randomly agreeing to be someone's flatmate off a facebook group. So, I asked a couple friends around from university who were in the Bay area to see if any of their leases were ending. If I know them no adjustment required, my wife or mom could come visit anytime and for as long. I found only one friend (say, X) whose lease ends soon and who wants to search for 2bed/2bath apt together but the only problem - she is a woman (F30). Now let me clarify, the problem isn't with X. X was a good friend of mine from University and has become friends with my wife over the many times they met when she visited me. The problem was me thinking that it is okay for a married man to stay with another woman as a flatmates, and to suggest that to my wife.\n\nLet me elaborate. The first time I suggested this to my wife, her entire body language changed. After a day of nagging her about what was wrong, she didn't directly say it but led me to fact that it had to do with what I suggested last day. I wanted to know whether she was not okay with me as a married guy living with another woman. She said and confirmed multiple times that she was absolutely okay with it but hinted at the fact that it might look weird from other people's perspective. \n\nA few days go by. I search for apt around my workplace (don't own a car, so being close is kinda important). This confirms my initial assumption that I do indeed save at least $200-300 per month if I have a flatmate. Saving up is quite crucial to both of us because we were earning peanuts during grad school. So I ask my wife again if she was okay with me sharing a house or apt with a woman. She confirms again multiple times that she is absolutely okay with the idea and distrusting me is out of the question. So I say, \"Then you know it will be really convenient if I stay with X. *list all reasons*. What do you think?\"\n\nHer demeanor and behavior completely changes. This time for 3-4 days. She kept avoiding calls and finding excuse to hang up while on the phone. Outwardly she kept saying everything was fine. After those days, I managed to get her to talk to me about what was wrong and she starts off by saying that I have causes irreparable damage by suggesting something like this. I have put her in a \"compromising position\" that she will never do to me. I don't value her anymore. She also says that I have constantly tried to to gaslight her into thinking that what I suggested was right. But when I ask her if she thinks its wrong, she says no. \n\nI tried to explain to her that maybe our misunderstanding stems from the fact that she is fundamentally not okay with me living with another woman, while I assumed she was fine. She vehemently disagrees and says that isnt true. \n\nWhen I tell her that it is clear you have a problem with it, she disagrees with it. When I try to tell her why I thought it was okay by suggesting that if she wanted to stay with one of her male friends as a flatmate for convenience and monetary reasons I would never have an issue, she says that it is easy to say that because she never put me in such situations. \n\nI even said many times that I need to know what her genuine stance is on a topic. If she is not okay with something, of course I wouldn't do it but I need to know. She says that now she won't tell me because I should do what I see fit. \n\nMaybe it was my mistake - should have gotten the hint the first time when she suggested other people might not be okay with it. I have a history of missing her hints when she expects it. Now she thinks I damaged this relationship beyond repair and I don't know what to do. \n\nEven this post was her idea.",

She may also be jealous about how that could be perceived. \n\nShe needs to communicate openly with you about what the source of these feelings are for her and, if she lays a boundary regarding you living alone with a woman, I would probably recommend respecting that.\n\nBut, if she\u2019s not willing to actively communicate those boundaries with you, I\u2019m really not sure where you\u2019ll go from here.",

It seems she may be worried what other people will think about you sharing with a female when she, your wife, is not present. \nMoney is important but sometimes, peace of mind is more important. You have been apart a long time and this in itself can make secure people a little insecure.

It's expensive and it's cheaper to live with roommates and a friend of a friend was also moving to the same city, so we moved in together.  \n\nWe had a lot of boundaries and house rules, for our respective partners and for the sake of harmony at home.

    "postText": "I wanted to preface this by saying I love my boyfriend a lot. He gives me so much comfort and security and love. When I speak to my other friends about their relationships, I always feel fortunate that he\u2019s so loyal and loving to me. \n\nWe had met a while ago working the same minimum wage job. In that time, i\u2019ve been able to upgrade to a couple different opportunities while also entering college and getting a new perspective. Academics wasn\u2019t his strong suit (which is perfectly fine with me) which caused him to drop out of college. He was there at the minimum wage job before me, and he has stayed since i\u2019ve gone. \n\nHe has no want to change or leave in the future and he\u2019s content with where he is. He has big dreams of being rich but won\u2019t talk about the journey to get there. \n\nI love him so much, and he\u2019s one of the most supportive and loving people I\u2019ve met. We\u2019ve been together for 2 years now and I wouldn\u2019t want to do life with anyone else. But this one factor scares me a lot. I want a family in the future but don\u2019t want to be the breadwinner nor want to be struggling financially. \n\nAnytime I bring it up, he brushes it off. \u2018What\u2019s your 5 year plan\u2019 or \u2018Whats your 10 year plan\u2019 : \u2018get rich and vibe. maybe buy a house\u2019. \n\nAm I self-absorbed to be asking this? Am I blowing something small out of proportion? \n\nI hoped because he was older, maybe it would change the scheme of things than if he was my age but i don\u2019t know now. Personally, i\u2019ve noticed a decrease in my work ethic- getting lazier and more complacent than I used to be. I hope to go into the science academia field which requires so much work and focus, and I don\u2019t know if this will drag me down. \n\nI don\u2019t know what I should do and I\u2019d appreciate any advice :) \n\nTLDR: What should I do about my boyfriend who is perfect but lacks ambition. \n\n\nThank you so much in advance.",

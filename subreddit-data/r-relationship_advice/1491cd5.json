    "postText": "What is the most fair way to divide costs in a bought apartment?\n\nI (m25) am about to buy 2 bedroom apartment for me an my gf (f25) of 7 years. I am buying it because I have savings, and because I can get a government subsidized loan for it thanks to saving for 2 years into a special account. The interest would settle around 4.1% max. \n\nDespite this, I would still be quite broke for the next 10-20 years. We both make around 2k euros/month, though I might make it to 3k soon. Because the apartment will be in my name, I of course can't ask her to take half the mortgage. \n\nWe agreed to at least split the utilities (300e/m). But would it be fair to split the future maintenance and repair costs of the housing corporation (100-300e/m)? Technically they increase the value of the apartment that I hold ownership of. Though someone might say it maintains the value. Or is it more fair to split the interest portion of the mortgage? We also talked about her aquiring the furniture with her money, and we would establish that they are her belongings in the unlikely event of a breakup.\n\nTLDR: Buying an apartment in my name, what costs should I split with gf to not be screwing her over: Utilities, maintenance/repair, interests of mortgage?",

Never assume that your unmarried partner will be around and / or willing to contribute to a situation in which they are not legally obligated to do so.\n\nSplit everything down the middle, 50/50; written contracts are very important. If your partner is not ready or is unable to do so, then always assume that you will be 100% responsible.",

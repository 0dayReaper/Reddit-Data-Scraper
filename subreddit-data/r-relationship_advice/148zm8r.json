    "postText": "Confused and conflicted. How do I talk to him?\n\nI\u2019ve (41F) been seeing this guy (41 M) for almost 3 years now. We started as a hook up but kept talking and found a lot of similar interests. So we gradually hung out more and more. \n\nGradually it\u2019s felt more and more like a relationship. We\u2019ve never had \u201cthe talk\u201d about where we are in the relationship. This has been fine. Before I met him I had a painful breakup and this guy was nice to be with, without any pressure of jumping in to another relationship. I even dated another guy for a while until it ran it\u2019s course. While seeing this guy.\n\nOne time he went to use the restroom and was letting me play on his iPad. That\u2019s when a saw a message from another woman. I don\u2019t know her name since it\u2019s coded under a nickname (I don\u2019t want to say what the nickname is just in case). At first I was surprised and a little hurt. Then I thought to myself it would be hypocritical of me to be upset with him talking to someone else when I\u2019m dating someone else. So I let it go. \n\nThings between me and the guy have been great. We see each other a lot and are talking with each other every day. We\u2019ve bought each other nice gifts for birthdays and holidays. We\u2019re even planning our first trip together later this year. All this time I\u2019ve been seeing him he\u2019s never felt distant or not interested in being intimate. \n\nTonight I was on his iPad and he went to the bathroom again. That\u2019s when I saw another message from the other woman. I couldn\u2019t help it and looked at his messages. My heart sunk. He buys her Starbucks and sometimes they see each other when I\u2019m not with him. I\u2019m not mad but things between us have been great. My birthday was a few weeks ago and we spent everyday together for 8-9 days. Never once did he seem distant or hid his phone from me. \n\nI want to approach the subject with him. I don\u2019t know how to go about it since we\u2019ve been seeing each other for so long. I\u2019m not really mad since we never talked about being exclusive. Since we\u2019re about to go on a trip together I wanted to ask him how he felt about me introducing him to my family. Now I\u2019m just confused. I don\u2019t want to stop seeing him and I feel like he\u2019s the most compatible guy I have ever been with.  How do I talk to him about it? I don\u2019t want to scare him off. I still want him to be in my life. \n\nSorry for the rambling and any missed context. This just happened an hour ago and I\u2019m still trying to process it all. \n\nAny advice would be great. \n\nTL:DR: been seeing someone for 3 years. Want to talk about our relationship without scaring him off. Even though he\u2019s seeing someone behind my back. How do I approach the subject without scaring him off?",

            "comment": "So the first thing you have to think about is, are you prepared to walk away? \n\nBecause you have two options:\n\nRip the bandage off and confront him. You have not set proper boundaries, so he\u2019s running amok with whatever he can get without any need to make anything official. I\u2019m glad you understand that until you have the talk he is free to talk to other people because you guys have not explicitly acknowledge that you guys are exclusive.\n\nIf he says that he wants to be exclusive, awesome! That is when you said your boundaries and expectations with him and you guys move forward.\n\nIf he comes back and he doesn\u2019t give you a firm. Yes you are in a relationship. Anything outside of a firm yes is a no if he does not give you that firm yes and you are not willing to wait for a relationship then you need to stop all this extra nonsense that you guys are doing and move on and find someone who wants what you want. If you\u2019re OK with your arrangement, then accept it and keep it moving.",

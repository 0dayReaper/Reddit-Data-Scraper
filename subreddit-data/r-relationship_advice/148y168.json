    "postText": "Hi everyone. So yesterday, I unexpectedly saw the person with whom I had a deep connection after almost a year of not seeing them. Despite having dated other people since then, whenever I reflect on my life, my thoughts invariably return to that person. She decided to part ways, but recently she has been on my mind. Yesterday, as I sat in my truck and they got into their car, unaware of my presence, everything felt incredibly fresh again. Last year, Thad even tried to coincidentally run into them several times, and now, without any effort, the emotions resurfaced. This experience made me realize that the feelings I had for her were unique and unmatched by anyone else I have dated. It's not that I simply like her - I still love her, despite the circumstances. For some time now, my instincts have been signaling that something significant is on the horizon. However, I'm aware that this could be wishful thinking on my part. If you were in my position, what would you do? Do you try to reach out to her?",

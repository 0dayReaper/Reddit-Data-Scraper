            "comment": "Hello, everyone!\n\nWe are in the unique &amp; exciting position to potentially be the recipient of a community grant from Reddit. We\u2019re not sure if our application will be successful, or how much money we\u2019ll get. But, we wanted your input since this will directly impact you, the user. \n\nSome give-away ideas we are tossing around:\n\n-\tOne month of therapy from an online therapy source, such as Better Help.\n-\tA copy of a book on relationships from an author such as Kerry Cohen, who was our frequent guest during the Reddit Talks era\n-\tA game designed to help you and your partner grow closer \n-\tDonating to a charity or charities voted on by our users, most likely ones that help victims of domestic violence, as we sadly saw an explosion of domestic violence-themed posts during the COVID-19 lockdowns. \n\n\nAgain, I cannot guarantee our grant request will be successful but since this will directly impact you, we wanted to get your feedback. Please take a minute to fill out this survey. It's completely anonymous, neither myself or anyone else on the moderation/admin team will see who answered what.\n\nI wanted also to take this time to thank all 8.87 (!) million of you! You are what makes this subreddit so amazing. We may not be the biggest subreddit, but I'd like to think we're the most caring. It is because of our amazing userbase that we're even being considered.",

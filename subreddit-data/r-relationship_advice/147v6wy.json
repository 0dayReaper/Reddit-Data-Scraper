    "postText": "This is all still fresh and developing. It just happened thirty minutes ago.\n\nMy daughter (25 F) was in an extremely abusive relationship for four years. He beat her, destroyed her property, threatened her, and threatened my neighbor when he tried to intervene once.\n\nI have stuck beside her through everything despite her crossing my boundaries several times. Finally, two years ago, after the traumatic almost nine month stillbirth of his child, I told her to stay with him if she wants but leave me completely out of it because it almost killed me. No phone calls about him, No asking for money. Nothing. I wanted peace. She ended up visiting him in Arizona. He beat her up again and destroyed her property. she used a credit card of mine (behind my back) to fund this little getaway and it ended badly. She ended up back home with me and swore to leave him alone. Charges were filed and he did time in jail.\n\nFast forward to now. She had her own place and was in college, but just moved back home last November because of the rising costs of rent. Everything has been fine until today.\n\nShe just came in and told me that she is going to visit him in Arizona and that she will not involve me in their relationship and i am not to ask about it.\n\nY'all, I was in complete shock. I stared at her with my mouth open. Every time in the past she has said I will not be involved, the opposite happens. I still have PTSD from rescuing her from dirty motels after being beaten up. I am still traumatized from all the nights worrying if he finally killed her.\n\nTruthfully, I am no longer in shock. I am angry and I want my peace back. I don't want any part of this. I don't even want her in my home anymore. I have had to grieve her in my head before because I was sure he was going to kill her. I don't want to have to go through that again but I know, despite what she says, that I will be pulled into the nightmare again because that is how abusive relationships work.\n\nWhat is the best way to let her know that, going forward, I need to withdraw from the current status quo of our relationship? I really don't want to talk to her anymore and I need to prepare for moving away from her and the abusive shit storm that she is a welcoming back into her life.\n\nI love all of my children and my heart is breaking right now, but I just want to be happy with my little dog in my safe space, my home. I no longer have the fight in me to join the rodeo again.\n\nIs low contact the best approach for my own mental wellbeing?\n\nEDIT: Sorry for any typos. Pretty emotional.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2: Well that was fast. I explained to her that I cannot continue with our relationship as is if she goes with him.  She told me she loves him and they are going to be together and have children.  She said that if I cannot accept that, I will not her a relationship with her or future grandchildren.\n\nShe did the hard work for me. Now we just have to figure out a move date for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit 3: I am opening the lines of communication again. She is willing to talk about this.\n\n**EDIT 4: I mentioned a lot of the good points made here and she is now willing to go to therapy before committing to taking the trip. I still have anxiety, but it is step in the right direction. Once she has a few solo sessions, we will then see a family therapist together.** \n\n**We will still go low contact if she chooses to be with him, but the lifeline will remain should she find herself in danger. I love her very much and want no harm to come to her. I also love myself and will not be part of that abusive cycle any longer.** ",

She got herself into college and landed a comfortable WFH position with weekends off. She was able to shop for herself and no longer worry about him taking all of her income. We would go out to dinner or shopping every weekend. She seemed to have matured so much.  To see her going back into the gutter is devastating.",

An abusive persons goal is to always isolate their victims from the family and friends. You can go low contact. Also, both you and her need therapy. Without therapy she will not be able to heal and break the pattern. Abusers are very good in showing that they have changed and they will behave like that for even months till they again show their true self and then after the incident again love bomb their victims, gaslight them and tell them that they care for them and it was the action of the victim that caused them to behave like that.  Abusive people are unfortunately are biggest manipulators.. They can manipulate even the most strong willed people with no insecurities.",

It must be incredibly challenging to witness your daughter returning to an abusive relationship after all the trauma both of you have endured. Your feelings of anger, shock, and exhaustion are completely valid.\r  \n\r  \nTaking care of your own mental wellbeing is crucial, and it's okay to set boundaries to protect yourself.\n\n\r  \nWhen it comes to communicating your decision to your daughter, I suggest having a heartfelt and gentle conversation. Find a calm and private setting where you can talk openly without interruptions. Express your concerns and emotions honestly, emphasizing that you love her and care about her wellbeing. But also that the moment she leaves to be with him again, she is going to be evicted from your home.\r  \n\r  \nAcknowledge that abusive relationships can sometimes have a negative impact on the people surrounding the victim, including yourself. Explain that for your own mental health, you need to step back and distance yourself from the situation. Let her know that while you understand she will make her own choices, you cannot continue to be a part of a cycle that has caused you so much pain and worry.\r  \n\r  \nReassure her that this decision doesn't mean you love her any less. Emphasize that it's important for her to seek professional help, support groups, or counseling to navigate her own journey and break free from the abusive relationship. Encourage her to prioritize her own safety and wellbeing, as well as seek resources that can assist her in leaving the toxic environment.\r  \n\r  \nRemember to take care of yourself during this challenging time. Reach out to trusted friends, family members, or professionals who can provide support and guidance.",

I have an extremely similar story and my mom and our family has had to go through the same with my little sister since she was 17. Except unfortunately she ended up having two of the abusive psychos kids. After being with him I think it drove my sister to the edge because she never stopped viewing us as the enemy after he brainwashed her and she\u2019s so emotionally dead and bipolar now because she never got any help and turned to drugs.\n\nI think we hit our limit this year after she kept abusing our boundaries and was constantly disappearing and lying while we were raising her kids. She actually stopped seeing her abusive ex august 2022 but slowly started separating herself from us (her family) since then. She finally ran away a couple of months ago in April and temporarily moved in with her abusive ex\u2019s freaking stepfather (a 50 something year old man who apparently is in love with my 20 year old sister.) and now last I heard she\u2019s living in a shelter. She constantly lies so it\u2019s hard to find out any truth about her. It\u2019s a really messy situation and the kids are suffering which is really hard to deal with because they are the most sweetest and loving kids.\n\nThings I\u2019ve learned as I\u2019ve observed and witnessed everything is as a parent the only thing you can do is love your child. The fact that you have stuck by her for so long and really tried to help her shows your character. You do not have to go back into that hell with her. All your feelings are valid. My mom has basically given up a lot of the past five years to try to do anything to help my sister. She raised her kids up until two months ago and started sacrificing her own mental and physical health to try to help her only to have it mean nothing to my sister. Don\u2019t do that. Take care of yourself. I know it\u2019s cliche but it really is true, you absolutely cannot help someone that doesn\u2019t want to help themselves. It sounds like your daughter is on a self destructive path and my sister is too. When they decide to stop, they will finally stop. The scary part is thinking how far they\u2019ll let it go before they finally decide to do something and help themselves. However, that\u2019s on them.\n\nFocus on your life and your other kids. No matter how old your other kids are, this must be equally as hard on them as it is for you. Love them and focus on your relationship with them as they need you. Watch movies with your dog and if you\u2019re religious (or not,) send out prayers and love to your daughter in Arizona. That\u2019s all you can do. I\u2019m not really religious but it makes me feel better sometimes. Much love to you and I will add your daughter to my prayers too. \u2764\ufe0f",

Set your boundaries with her though and if he ever attempts to intimidate you take out a restraining order.

My ex cut me off from everyone for two years, and the only reason I had the courage to finally kick him out is because my parents always let me know that I had a safe space to come back to in their home. Leaving an abusive situation is hard. The way I defended my ex, and  even cut my parents out of my life at one point, destroyed my mom. \n\nMom would constantly point out to me that he was abusing me and that he was a controlling ahole, and the more she said those things the more she unwittingly drove me toward him. Once she decided to \u201caccept\u201d him (she faked it of course) into the family was when I started to step back and think about my situation. But I needed that space to figure it out for myself. And I needed the assurance that I would have a safe space to turn to.\n\nAnd now, 17 years later I\u2019m in an incredibly healthy marriage and my bond with my mom is very strong.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that this will be the outcome for you and your daughter, as every situation is different. \n\nI\u2019m just asking you not to cut her off completely, and not to approach the situation or conversation from a combative stance. Let her know that you love her and want to see her thrive, and that if she ever decides that she wants a better situation for herself you will be available to help her start over - no questions, just forward movement.\n\nGood luck, OP.",

I know it's easy for me to say this as someone detached from all this, but you can't set yourself on fire to keep her warm.\n\nShe's made her choice, and she's going to do it. It's probably going to end badly, like most addicts making awful life choices. She's stolen from you, thrown your help in your face and still decided she wants him.\n\nRespect her wishes. Don't talk to her about him. Don't listen to her complain about him. If she comes to you looking for help, direct her to some professional, third party services in your area where she can get mental and residential support if she does decide to leave him again.\n\nLike addicts, it's an unfortunate fact that being there for someone constantly will not help. It enables them. If they have someone to fall back on, they know no matter how badly they act or poorly they choose, they'll have someone to pick up the pieces. People often need to hit rock bottom before they understand.\n\nI wouldn't cut off the idea of ever being in contact with her again. But boundaries need to be set. When she's left him, when she's sought appropriate help and got things sorted in her life, you can always leave the door open to forging a relationship again. But at this point in time, you're just her enabler and that's all she sees you as.",

Do you happen to know if he is on any sort of probation? If so, there may be a condition that states he is to have no contact with your daughter. I work in the area of domestic violence and have a few additional thoughts:\n\n1) It takes the average abuse victim seven attempts to leave their abuser before they can do so for good. \n2) Abusers actively try to isolate their victim from friends and family, so totally cutting her off would be ideal for him. It tightens his control over her by removing her support system. \n3) You absolutely are entitled to boundaries to keep yourself as mentally healthy and safe as possible. There is nothing wrong with setting boundaries. You have done so much for your daughter and please be gentle with yourself.\n4) This question is above Reddit\u2019s pay grade. I would reach out for help in two ways. First, contact a local domestic violence advocacy group or visit the National Domestic Violence Hotline website at thehotline.org. Most agencies offer counseling or the option to speak with trained advocates. They might be able to give you the best advice about your situation. Second, get a therapist. A good therapist can help you define which boundaries are best for you and help you manage the emotional fallout of this terrible situation. \n\nAs a mother, my heart breaks for you. As a worker in this field, my heart breaks for you. Domestic violence is a vicious cycle. You have done so much for your daughter and given so much of yourself. You can\u2019t make her decisions for her but you can decide to protect yourself and that is 100% okay. I wish you and your daughter the best. Please be gentle with yourself and take care.",

I had 99% of my family cut me off, \"tough love,\" they called it, which looking back, I understand completely.\n\nMy momma though, my sweet momma. Oh the agony I KNOW I put her through.  She was abused by my dad growing up, seeing her baby girl go through it, was like dejavu for her.\n\nShe let him know it was not right for him to do that to me, he made her empty promises saying he wouldn't hit me anymore, etc. She never once controlled me or the situation. I can't even fathom how hard it was for her to do that as a mother. She was the only one who let me live and make my own mistakes, she would even stop by and bring over basic grocery/household needs from time to time. She never used any bad language when talking in regards about him.  Just making sure I knew that getting hit and being yelled at is not normal, and not okay, and she just wants me happy. \n\nMy mom was never particularly close with me and the relationship, I didn't ask for help much, I knew she mainly stopped by with groceries just to check up on me.\n\nBut man oh man was she my saving grace.  There was something about her standing on the sidelines, never taking control, but just riding my ride with me, not micromanaging it, never telling me she told me so, but let me just experience the ride on my own.\n\nit helped me leave the relationship. We talked almost every day, she would call me to ask if I was okay, we had Sunday dates, we would watch forensic files, and other shows like that.  Sometimes she would call me randomly asking If I was okay, I didn't know until later, from my stepdad, how often my mom couldn't sleep at night, she would stay up crying scared for my life. I have been put in more than one occasion, where I could understand why she felt that way.\n\nHer love for me helped me escape that relationship, she had this perfect balance of being there for me, but also giving me the lightest hand of discipline.\n\nI think it helped that she was in an abusive relationship for about 17 years or so before she finally left.  It's like she knew exactly what I needed to hear to leave the relationship on my own terms.\n\nIt is completely up to you, he has completely mind sucked and brainwashed your daughter, she is convinced that he is the only one who loves her, and you giving her ultimatums is probably feeding him exactly what he wants to isolate your daughter.\n\nIf you are where you say you with wanting your peace, just keep in mind, when your daughter does finally realize you were right (if she ever does) you as her mother, giving up on her, she will never forget that. \n\nI understand completely where you are at, looking back and seeing how much pain I caused my mom I wish I could take it all back. I wish you all the best, this is so hard, there's no right or wrong here. It does seem like he has her by the grips pretty tight, and until she feels like she's out permanently, unfortunately there's nothing you can do.",

It all sounds dandy and thus confusing why her daughter behaves this way but people do not go back to abusive partners, if not for some parental issues or trauma they experienced during childhood.\n\nThe discussion over boundaries is valid. However, I am suggesting to OP that she addresses the root problem of her daughter's attachment to this problematic man and self-worth. Her daughter needs to be on a journey of healing. I just wanted to raise that to OP. \n\nShe is 48. Her daughter is 25. And she is throwing in the towel?

The worry of what he's doing to her, what he's making her do, and whether one day the cops will come to you and tell you she's been beaten to death by a man who's continually shown that he's got no problem hurting her and convincing her to steal money from her own mother. She needs to know that you're not cutting her off because you don't love her, but because you can't stand to see her with someone like that holding her back when someone who actually loves her enough to never even dream of treating her that way could be just around the corner.\n\nThe second thing you need to make clear is that even if you don't want to see her with this man, she is your daughter and you love her and will be there for her. But she gets one return now. One time when he's gone too far and she has to flee him. After that he has to be out of your lives forever because even if she survives him, you may not. And if he treats her the way you know he will again, and she brings that pain back to you again, and then still goes back to him? Then she needs to know right now that it will be the end of your relationship, not because you don't love her but because you love her so much you cannot bear to see her continually allowing herself to suffer like this.\n\nFrom then on, you've done all you can do and far more than you can ever be reasonably expected to do. She needs to know she can come back to you but she also needs to know how much this affects you and others and how this venomous man needs to be out of your lives for good as he's poisoning your relationship with each other as well as her own self esteem. After all, why would she continue to go back to anyone who intentionally hurts her and has repeatedly shown he's not willing to change? Because he's made her think she's not worth anything better.

I struggle to imagine my daughter in that same situation and I don't know what I would do.  You have every right to protect your peace if she is choosing this terrible decision.  You don't have to bail her out anymore and its probably better for her to get a little tough love on this from you.  If she decides to put herself in dangerous situations she will have to clean up the mess herself.  That might shock her into realizing.",

Tell her you love her and that if she\u2019s really unwilling to let this abusive piece of garbage go then you cannot support her financially or emotionally.   Always leave the door open for when she actually does leave him. tell her that if she\u2019s in your home she\u2019s not to have any contact with him at all and that you will not be in her life if she is with him.",

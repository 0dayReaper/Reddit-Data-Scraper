    "postText": "She works a retail job and makes good money. She\u2019s salaried and works a ton extra. She\u2019s an assistant and recently her 5 other peers got to go golf and got paid while she ran the store solo. When she asked if she could have her \u201cfun day\u201d, the manager said there\u2019s not enough people to run the store (the lowest was 2 people)\n\nRecently the store director told her that she could basically get a $100 a week raise it just has to be approved by the manager. That fell through. \n\nI feel like she\u2019s not being assertive enough and is getting pushed around. I guess she might be afraid of retaliation? It\u2019s just hard for me because my job is union and a union steward would absolute rip this guy a new ass. I personally feel like she should submit s corporate complaint but maybe that\u2019s stupid? She also hates talking about it. So maybe I should just leave it be",

    "postText": "My (42F) boyfriend (42M) of 1.5 years live together. We have an understanding that he goes out and stays out 1-2 nights and full days most weeks. I don\u2019t love it since he doesn\u2019t like to say where he is or who he is with but I 98% trust he is just with the guys playing video games.\n\nMy biggest issue comes in the fact that he will go completely no contact for the entire day. Most of the time if I don\u2019t hear from him, I have to text him. I had to fight to get him to text me to let me know that he would be staying out all night. (He finally begrudgingly agreed). He rarely if ever answers the phone when I call and most of the time doesn\u2019t respond to my texts for hours if at all. I have told him time and time again that I feel it\u2019s disrespectful to not find 3 seconds to send me a text just to say hi or tell me he\u2019s thinking of me - don\u2019t want to call it a check in but you know check in. I\u2019m at a breaking point where this is making me more and more angry every day and he makes me feel like I\u2019m ridiculous for asking for communication. \n\nI do love this man and he swears he loves me. I\u2019ve been cheated on in the past (not by him)  and admittedly I need a bit more sometimes in order to feel safe in this relationship.\n\nI\u2019d like to get a consensus on what Reddit thinks about this situation and would others be as upset as I am for being what I considered ignored. Or am I crazy and he makes me feel?!",

Yes something is up he is either getting sucked off by his friend Todd to keep you fooled or has a side girl lined up, Or hates you so much he rather be out the house as much as his schedule allows it, Or he just feels he has to answer to no one and can do what he wants..  IDK u don't like it so that means you don't like him so leave him since 1.5 years is nothing. \n\nYou can't change people like that, someone has to just naturally know its not odd or hurtful.",

I don\u2019t know what you want at 42 but I can\u2019t imagine that this is it. If you eventually want a family or just a stable, committed relationship where you don\u2019t have to wonder where your partner is and beg them to communicate, then you need to move on. And  he can swear that he loves you but his actions suggest otherwise.\n\nPS -  is this the former inmate who did 20 years?!",

His views of communication from how he spent the last 22 years are so different from most. I love this man so much and most of the time he shows me he loves me as well. This is truly our only issue at this point and idk if it\u2019s a hill I want to die on. Everything you\u2019ve said I\u2019ve said to him as well. It has helped to see some unbiased opinions on the topic so thanks!",

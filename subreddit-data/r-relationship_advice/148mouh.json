    "postText": "our one year is coming up in a few days but there was never a time outside the first month of the relationship that i was sure i wanted to be with him, but i always stayed just in case. \n\nfor the first few months of the relationship i would spend every night i was there in the bathroom crying over something he said while he slept peacefully. he did apologize for that and said he still \u201chad his guard up\u201d from his last relationship, but it felt like more than that. he\u2019s also made comments on my body that makes being naked around him nerve wracking and i don\u2019t even feel comfy having sex with him anymore. i\u2019ve been compared to women who have had plastic surgery and he\u2019s said they look better than me. he\u2019s told me he\u2019s only ever seen one attractive vulva (it wasn\u2019t mine) and said all the others were ugly. i didn\u2019t ask for those opinions either and he knew i was already insecure. so i feel it was unwarranted. \n\ni\u2019m not allowed to make friends with other men, only women, which doesn\u2019t even make sense to me because i\u2019m bisexual and he knows it. i think it would be worse if i wasn\u2019t allowed to make friends at all, but the way i\u2019m condemned from other men makes me feel like he doesn\u2019t take my sexuality seriously. \n\ni also met him when i was 14 and he was 19. we were talking in a way that makes me uncomfortable now, but for some reason i thought that it would be better if i dated him. so when i was 17 and he was 22, we started dating. but now i\u2019m 18 and just have that weird feeling that i feel i may have been groomed. idk if i can call it that, because i was the one who pursued him, but i figure he was the adult in that situation and probably should\u2019ve known better. \n\nback to the story though. we have had good times, but the bad times outweigh them heavily. we recently just spent alot of time apart and i\u2019m starting to realize that the times i thought i missed him or the times i felt i needed to go see him, was simply because i was already in the routine of barely being apart from him so being alone felt strange. \n\nafter this time alone, i\u2019ve come to realize i don\u2019t enjoy his company as much as i thought it did. i\u2019m not happy in this relationship. i would like to break up with him but i\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s considered rude to break up with someone right before the first bigger milestone. i think it actually might be more rude to go see him and pretend everything is fine knowing what i\u2019ve been thinking about. but i\u2019m not sure. \n\ni\u2019m not sure what to do to be honest. i feel bad but i know this isn\u2019t something i can ignore.",

And it's not your fault that it is this way- it's his. He was 19 and dating a teenager who was just shy of getting out of the prepubescent phase. He has made it extremely difficult for you to make friends naturally, and therefore it's a form of abuse. Once the other partner starts restricting/intimidating and controlling your friend group, it is basically going to get worse from there. \n\nFact is that he is a predator, and did in fact groom you given that fact that you depended on him to even enjoy your own presence without him around. Breaking up with him is doing him a great disservice as he deserved to be locked up in jail for engaging with a 14 years when he was 19 years old. Definitely breakup with him, and make sure you are either in public or have a friend/family member with you. If it's online, then don't worry and just block him on everything. You definitely can do better and deserve better than a creep.",

The function of grooming is to foster a dynamic that is inappropriate, something you've noted. By stoking and intensifying that dynamic until the minor is less socially objectionable [though honestly he failed even that] they are able to make the victim believe they are the pursuer but looking back at the chats now I am sure you will see the signs of flirting quite early on. He was the adult, he did know better, he was specifically exploiting that. \n\nThat being said, let's be clear: the grooming isn't the [only] reason why you should leave him. He is just abusive and controlling in general. The grooming was just part of that, he took a minor and shaped them into the kind of partner he wanted, one that humoured his toxicity and control. You should want to leave because he is just a bad partner, controlling and toxic and awful to you.\n\nBut like moving too early and therefore exposing he was happy to pursue a minor this time apart let you see the reality you aren't happy. In a sense you are lucky it happened this way. \n\n1 year isn't that big a milestone. In fact that's about the time you realise a relationship is or isn't working, it can take a year just to really decide that. So don't let the symbolism of it lead you to dragging it out further. This isn't about being rude either, after all he groomed and has abused you, why is politeness a factor at all.",

If you want to break up, you need to do it immediatly; anything else is just worse.\n\nHow could stay with someone who you don't like be better? What are you gonna do? Lie? Put on a mask feigning all is good until you feel it's ok to break up? Or are you gonna let how you feel show, and when he ask you what's wrong you shrug it off? \n\nHow is any of these option better than just rip the band-aid?",

Don\u2019t feel guilty you were a child and he was an adult. The age gap is still shady as hell if he got to know you right before you started dating but the fact that you were 14 makes this 100x worse. \nI\u2019m happy you\u2019re on the right track to heal. \nIf you\u2019re financially capable therapy might be a good idea to solve body image problems he caused. And that part about sexuality just shows how pathetic and insecure he is",

As a Mum with a daughter a little bit older than you, I would absolutely want to know so I could block him from turning up and be protective of hell of you right now. \n\nI\u2019m glad you are blocking him but be aware he will do everything he can to try and get you to change your mind. He will probably cry, say he can\u2019t live without you, say he\u2019s sorry/had a hard life/bad ex or other excuses for being mean to you, he will change. Please don\u2019t believe him. Don\u2019t feel guilty or responsible for him. He will not change. Many of us older redditors will tell you we wasted years on these types of relationships and it doesn\u2019t change. \n\nYou are young, now is the time to travel, meet lots of people, date, explore careers, learn to drive, get educated - it\u2019s such an exciting time, don\u2019t waste it on him.",

    "postText": "We were walking home in the middle of the night. Some drunk was passing by and he touched my girlfriend's thigh with his hand when he was passing by us. She was like \"oh my god, he just touched me\". I turned around and shouted \"what the fuck?!\", the drunk was like \"what? you got a problem?\", we turned, shook our heads, were like \"what a fucking asshole\" and went home. At that moment I felt like \"it's not worth it\", but now I feel like such a fucking loser. I could've done something about it and I didn't. My gf doesn't seem phased by it (it SEEMS like it), and she doesn't want me getting in fights with drunks, as far as I'm concerned. But I feel miserable, I want to acknowledge it but don't know how and what to say. I think I was wrong because I let that asshole go. What should I say?",

It's also understandable that your girlfriend doesn't want you getting into a fight, but that doesn't mean that your feelings are invalid.  \nThe first thing I would do is talk to your girlfriend about how you're feeling. Let her know that you're not blaming her, but that you're feeling angry and helpless about what happened. She may be able to offer you some support and understanding.",

So, I wonder, if you had kept escalating and getting in this guy\u2019s face and ending up in a physical fight\u2026 would that have helped her feel safer in that moment? Because I know that more yelling and more assault doesn\u2019t usually help *me* feel safer.\n\n To me, you did exactly what I prefer my partner to do in that kind of situation. Listen to me and believe me, make a comment that shows the guy that what he did is not okay, and help me safely leave the situation. Talk to your girlfriend about this, but I suspect that if you did anything more it would be more about your own ego and less about supporting her.",

I felt weak because of that asshole walking away scot-free after touching my gf. But she is a person, not a lunchbox in a fridge with my name on it. I should think more about her and her feelings. I just suddenly started to feel very helpless for some reason, like she wouldn't feel safe with me, you know?",

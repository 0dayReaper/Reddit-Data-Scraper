    "postText": "So my bf and I have been together since Junior year of highschool. We are now in our junior year of college. We started dating Jan of 2020 and it\u2019s now June 2023. I love him so much but I feel as if I\u2019ve let too many things slip and I am slowly losing my say in our relationship. For some background context, my bf is here on a dependent visa so he cannot work, his father has to pay for everything for him. Due to this reason, whatever his family says goes. \nFor his first year of college they forced him to go to a school in Colorado because of \u201cit\u2019s prestigious status.\u201d They would always say this in front of me, and it hurt my feelings a bit because I decided to go to a lesser known school on an honors program scholarship. After one year, he decided to transfer to my school due to him developing severe anxiety and depression from the living conditions at his college, the party culture, and feeling as if he was alone too much. I was so happy he transferred because it meant we could see eachother more and take the next step in our relationship and live together. However, a part of me felt bad because I felt as if he was doing it for me since our LDR was slowly getting worse with a year of distance. \nLiving together was nice, it was new, and I truly love it. I love having someone with me, even if we\u2019re not doing something together. however, it introduced many new things to our relationship. When we first moved in, we divided up the tasks in the apartment equally. Over time, he got lazy and stopped doing things. This is led to many fights where I have to ask him to do the dishes, take out the trash, vacuum the floor, etc. Because of this, sometimes I feel like his mother. I feel like I have to baby him or beg him to do things around the house when I automatically do a deep clean, whether it be laundry, cleaning the kitchen, cleaning the bathrooms, etc. we had a big argument at one point where he expressed that I\u2019m not as physical as I used to be. When he brought it up, I realize that is true. However, I have taken time to reflect on why that is. For me, I feel that the reason why I haven\u2019t been as physical is because I\u2019ve slowly built up a sort of resentment towards him, because I have to pick up all the pieces, whether it be cleaning, helping him with schoolwork, or financially helping him. I truly love him and I wanna be with him, but when discussing this with my mother and some other friends they\u2019ve told me it won\u2019t change. \nwhen it comes to him, choosing people over me for holidays and other events, this is happened quite a bit. When we were dating for a year, we decided that we would split the holidays. However, on New Year\u2019s eve, when we were about to be dropped off at my house, he decided to tell me as we were walking in that he was actually going with his family for New Year\u2019s. I was definitely hurt at the time, but looking back I somewhat understand, considering that we were seniors in highschool. However, as the years have gone by, it still happens. This year he decided to give me a present of going with him on vacation before Christmas. But when it was actually Christmas, he went with his family for Christmas and New Year\u2019s. looking at present day, he decided to go on a big, biking trip. To prepare for this he decided to leave me at the apartment for the month of May and go to a different state to meet his father and prepare. This kind of hurt my feelings a bit because he\u2019s going to be gone all summer, and the one month we could\u2019ve had before he left he decided to leave because he needed more motivation. not only that, when I visited him before he left on his biking trip, his mother kept bringing up that they were going to Mexico for Thanksgiving , which is where he\u2019s from. He never told me anything about this so it was news to me. Thanksgiving wouldn\u2019t matter that much, but in this case it does matter because I am actually going abroad to England in the fall. I will be gone from August to December. Now throughout the trip his mom kept bringing this up and I asked him about it. He told me that they were going, and a part of me was sad because I wish you could come visit me in Europe, but I got over it. However, the next day, his mother brought up that instead of going with them to Mexico, he should go visit his younger sister, who is also studying abroad in France. Now, when I heard this, it made me very upset, because his mother had no problem suggesting he go see his sister instead of me knowing I\u2019m going abroad as well. This made me upset and he tried to tell me I was overreacting and there\u2019s nothing he can do because his parents r paying for the trip. So, in conclusion, my bf will be in Europe, 3 weeks after my bday, which he\u2019s missing as well, and he\u2019ll choose to see his sister over me. Anyways i just wanted to get this out and maybe ask for some other opinion\u2019s and see if anyone can offer me advice about the situation? How can I fix it? Is there anything to be fixed? Or am I wasting my time? I don\u2019t know how to get over these feelings and to fix the relationship. \n\nTLDR; boyfriend chooses family and their opinion over me all the time. Especially for holidays, birthdays, vacations and it\u2019s getting me upset cause idk if i\u2019m wasting time.",

Even if he truly was \u201crequired\u201d to do these things with his family, if he truly loved you, he would be so apologetic about it and likely would be arguing with his family about not wanting to. He\u2019s not doing either of these based on your description. Go into this summer &amp; Europe a free woman. That is an important step. A LDR was tailor made for a BF like this. If he grows up and realizes what he\u2019s doing, he will beg you to reconsider and become more attentive. My bet is that won\u2019t happen.",

    "postText": "I am 23(M) and I've been raped before. Twice. I've been sexually assaulted too and this has affected me and subsequent relationships a lot. 2 days ago my girlfriend (23) was in my lap and we were making out and suddenly the images of rape came into my mind and I froze. She obviously sensed it and asked if everything was okay but I couldn't answer and I'd begun to sweat. She got of my lap and asked if I wanted to talk but i still couldn't say anything. Then she asked if she should leave the room and I gave a small nod. She just grabbed her phone from the table and left. This has never happened with me. Nobody has listened to my no before. It feels weird, different ? I don't know. \n\nNext morning when I woke up she had made breakfast and left me a note saying if I wanted to talk I could call her anytime. She came over after work and I thanked her for listening to me, I was almost in tears. She welled up too and said no obviously means no, but hesitation means no too. And that she would never knowingly hurt me. I've never been treated like this before. My parents were shit, and almost every relationship I've had (3) were also similarly shit. \n\nBut she's different, she's been my rock when I've fallen low, she cooks for me because she wants me to be healthy, she leaves notes of affirmation all over the house for me to find and is generally the most genuine amazing person I've ever met. I want to show my gratitude to her and want to tell her how much she means to me but I don't know how ? Also it's still weighing on me how my say matters to her. Never in my life have I ever been treated this way. \n\nSo how do I tell how much she means to me ? And will I stop feeling this way ?\n\n\nEDIT:- oh my god, y'all. I never expected this kind of response! I'm trying to read through them all but thank you so much! \n\nTo clarify a few things, almost everyone who commented suggested therapy. Therapy is super expensive and I'm already working to pay for school but yes I've started therapy, it's been about 5 months now. Just taking baby steps here. \n\nSecondly y'all gave a ton of good ideas but I think I'm gonna write her a letter and maybe arrange for a small picnic for the two of us. I know she'll love it. \n\nFor those saying I should propose, that's definitely the plan, just not now. \n\nAnd to those who shared their (similar) Experiences, thank you. It gave me an insight and I hope things look up for you. \n\nAnd for all those who said I'm a 'pussy' for getting raped or I'm lying, I'm sorry but I can't make y'all believe me. I hope y'all feel better after this.b\n\n\nAgain, thank you so much for your kind comments. Y'all are amazeballs.",

Quality time? Acts of service? Physical touch? Words of affirmation?\n\nNot saying to focus on only one - but it could help give you more specific ideas. Even on a date doing things she enjoys, you might be able to dig a little deeper: would she love being presented a heartfelt letter (gifts + words of affirmation)? A quiet evening stroll, hand in hand (physical touch + quality time)?\n\nOn the other hand, she sounds like a keeper and I wish you two the best. Sorry you've gone through what you have, and I'm glad that you're finally being treated the way that you deserve to be treated!",

He\u2019s a physical touch and quality time guy. Now after so many years, I give myself gifts and I give him physical attention and my time and focus, and he provides acts of service for me and sometimes a treasure or two. It\u2019s a good system for us, we did have to work it out and learn about how to better serve one another, and then adjust accordingly, but even the learning piece was really fun and very rewarding.",

Cook her a romantic dinner, or if cooking isn\u2019t your forte take her somewhere nice. \n\nOver dinner basically tell her what you told us, or write a note and let her read it at dinner if that\u2019s easier than speaking your feelings. Either way, she\u2019ll appreciate knowing how you feel about her. Her actions towards you clearly show you how much she loves and cares about you, return the favor!

It will be very tough, but I noticed that after just a few sessions, I thought (and think) very different about my traumas now. It does work, and it's a very good therapy to get rid of your traumas. Good luck!",

Once a session about a particular situation was over (for instance: i must walk through a park 3 times and not run and talk about how it felt afterwards) it ended up with me never doing it again. The fear was just too much to handle on my own. I did exposure therapy for a couple of years, but my symptoms kept getting worse. I just couldn't handle it at all. \n\nMy EMDR therapist made me walk through the park in her office. She led me through the park as often as I needed to to lower the fear in my body and mind. In the end I could, in my mind, walk through the park and not feel afraid anything bad was going to happen to me. I had a normal sense of \"I dont like this place\" but I didnt have the \"I need to get out of here or I'll die\" feeling. The every day anxiety went away, I regularly walked through the park, and I had other triggers that no longer bother me because of this therapy. \n\nWhat took me years of (exposure) therapy to work through was solved in 6 EMDR sessions. \n\nThe sessions left me drained for days, I just slept and slept like I've never had a minute of sleep before. I was emotionally unstable, quickly annoyed and I didn't feel like doing much of anything. But in the end it was all worth it. I have no triggers anymore. Maybe twice a month I have a bad moment, but it passes rather quickly. I don't suffer from extreme insomnia anymore, I can go wherever I want to, other people and lots of other things don't scare me anymore. I'd do it all again in a heartbeat. \n\nThen again, this is my personal story. What worked for me may not at all work for someone else. But if anyone reads this and has never heard of EMDR before, do some Googling, ask you doctor, save some money if you have to. Try a few sessions if you can and hopefully everything works out.",

When traumatic events get \"stuck\" is our brain because they are too horrible to process, they stay in the \"near term\" memory and are experienced as such. As fresh as the day they happened. EMDR works to move those through the brain.\n\nThis is different than Cognitive Behavioral Therapy which address how you think about a problem/trauma.  Versus EMDR which seeks to address how you remember/experience trauma.\n\nI am not a practitioner. The above is my paraphrase of a description I have heard several times from an experienced practitioner of both methods.",

We worked over several sessions on finding and growing that sense of calm and making it so that my brain automatically connected the back and forth hand sensation to feeling calm and safe. After that, I chose a traumatic memory to process.\n\nMy therapist asked me to think of an image that represents the trauma for me. Like a picture. Then to say one negative self belief that I associate with this image (for me: \u201cI am incapable\u201d since I felt guilty and angry with myself for not being able to stop the assault) and what positive self belief you want that to become (\u201cI am capable\u201d). Then, while the buzzers are in hand as my brain associates them with safety, I processed my stuff. When I was able to reach my new positive self belief and actually believe it, we moved on to another negative self belief I associated with the situation.\n\nWhenever I\u2019ve had any anxiety about something related to the situation, I\u2019ve been able to tap my fingers back and forth and think of my calm place, which automatically calms me down. I\u2019m no expert but I view EMDR as a way to create new neural tracks in my brain in order to safely process my most terrible memories.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more to it than that. I did have a panic attack during one of my sessions but my therapist was there to help me through it and care for me afterwards. If your husband does do EMDR, make sure it\u2019s with a therapist who can help him while he does it.",

A major component of EMDR is engaging eye movement while processing traumatic incidents. The eye movement triggers an area of your brain which relates to trauma response. Tetris requires rapid eye movement which might be similar to the process in EMDR, though is likely only helpful in tandem with a therapeutic process. That's not to say it might not also play a valuable role on distraction if that's your thing!",

Eight months later the cure rate was 73 percent for the adult-onset group, compared with 25 percent for those with histories of child abuse. The child-abuse group had small but consistently positive responses to Prozac.&gt;  \n\n-Bessel van der Kolk, The body keeps the score.\n\nI think it's important to realise that psychiatry is still quite novel and not that well understood.

In other words, we don\u2019t know if the eye movement component actually does anything useful and more research is needed to see if the eye movement matters at all. \n\nSo why does EMDR work if the eye movement is potentially bogus? \nWell, we think that the reason people get better with EMDR is the exposure component (you are exposed and talk about your trauma, learn how to process it). This is similar in other evidence based treatments for trauma, like CPT and other cognitive/behavioral approaches. \n\nBottom line: lots of effective treatments exist for trauma. However, just wanted to caution folks about thinking the eye movement aspect is a panacea. \n\n[info on EMDR](https://div12.org/treatment/eye-movement-desensitization-and-reprocessing-for-post-traumatic-stress-disorder/)\n\n[What the APA recommended treatments are](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/treatments/index)",

Like \"I almost died in an explosion/I saw someone get shot to death, now loud noises automatically make me feel like I'm in a life &amp; death situation.\" Because that's such an automatic, subconscious process there isn't much to get in to with more traditional therapies.\n\nHowever with sexual assault victims especially, it's similar to what OP mentioned. Something made them think of the assault, and they were thinking about the assault and that's what triggered the panic. There is a more thought based process happening there, and sexual assault victims often benefit from a trauma specific variation of CBT. \n\nagain, whatever works for an individual is great. But I think a lot of people are under the impression EMDR is a miracle cure, and then they feel like garbage when it doesn't work for them. It really hasn't been as effective as early studies indicated it might be, and my understanding is that it was mostly being pushed by the VA because it can treat people in fewer sessions and cheaper than a form of CBT type of therapy (and I think they've struggled to get people to go along with therapy)",

A gift that shows you know her, not just something fancy and expensive - something that shows that you see her (like she sees you). A helping hand with an overwhelming project. Do you know her love language? It sounds a little silly but it\u2019s actually super useful. People show love differently and I would mix something between the way you like to show love and the way she likes to receive it. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe her this though, and I don\u2019t think she feels like you owe anything.

I sorta clarified with him that this was just gonna be drinks and i wasn't interested in hooking up but he still wanted to meet.\n\nAnyway, he offered me a cab to get to his, (neither of us was in a fit state to drive lol) and we ended up getting really drunk, He was a great guy and we're just cuddling up chatting like we've known each other for years. One thing leads to another and I just sorta think 'fuck it why not?'\n\nTbh I'm not even sure what changed but it just wasn't doing anything for me, i tried to just carry on but the drink and other things were really hitting me now and the world was spinning in a drunken bad way.\n\nHe asked me if I was ok, and i just said I want to stop. I was expecting him to get angry, or emotional, or demand reasons but he just accepted. He asked if i wanted to go home or him to go back to the living room, neither of which i did, he asked if we could just snuggle and besides a joke about him wanking in the toilet so he wasn't poking me he was fine with it.\n\nIt was just...idk... refreshing that his only concern wasn't him and it meant more to him that we both enjoyed it",

I can't really describe it, but essentially instead of butterflies there was a pit in my stomach whenever I was around her. Again, I can't speak on how your girlfriend will handle it in the future, and so far I'd say she's doing all the right things, but professional help for you is something I think will benefit you both. \n\nBut, as in all cases, listen to yourself rather than strangers on the internet.

A girl I had repeatedly expressed no interest in wouldn\u2019t get the hint. I\u2019d been drinking at a friend\u2019s house so I decided to crash on their couch. I woke up an hour later to her straddling me and trying to take my pants off. She was not listening to me tell her to get off of me and she was very aggressive and persistent. I finally shoved her back and donkey kicked her off the couch. My \u201cfriend\u201d and his girlfriend were standing there laughing while it happened thinking it was funny. I\u2019m lucky I wasn\u2019t drinker than I was that night.Rape can happen to anyone and getting raped doesn\u2019t make you less of a man in any way.

Having a partner, genders irrelevant, who not only stop fucking when they see their partner is uncomfortable/not enjoying themselves, and not take it personally but follow up afterwords to see what's wrong, is the gold standard to work towards in any relationship. \n\nIt may be embarrassing, or bring up bad memories, or you might be afraid of the outcome, but this situation can only be improved further with communication. It sucks that many men and women share your story, but letting your partner in and sharing that pain with you and letting her support you will only strengthen the bonds you two share, with you unburdening youself of horror and her wanting to be there with you. Just remember, if the situation was reversed, you would absolutely do it for her. Let her be your rock too.\n\nYou got this. No one ever gets over trauma on their own, but plenty of people unfortunately never get over it period. They hold it in until it does irrepairable harm. I don't think you'll feel this way forever as long as you take steps to treat yourself. You'd seek help if you had a broken arm, you should do the same for your wounded mind.",

The fact that she did breakfast and all of that other stuff for you shows how much she cares. You want to show her how much you appreciate it:\n\n\\-Five love languages are a good way to start, what does she respond best towards? Second, what is she interested in? i.e. Does she like going for walks? Maybe a visit to the local museum or observatory would be a good activity. Maybe a dinner to a fancy restaurant.

But with someone who properly loves you and supports you, hopefully it'll get a little easier every day.\n\nI wouldn't presume to know what you've been through, but I was abused myself as a child and that abuse has had an impact on all of my relationships on some level.  And even when I thought I was finally \"over it\", new memories resurfaced which devastated me and nearly ruined my marriage. \n\nI'm sorry for what you've been through, as useless as that apology is. I'd say you're taking the right steps mentally and emotionally, and while I'm sure you'll never forget, hopefully after a few years in a healthy relationship, you'll notice just how heavy and burdensome the armor you've built up is, and that maybe, you don't need to worry about protecting yourself like that any more.\n\nIt sounds like you have met a very special person.\n\nGood luck, OP.",

Also the question about how to show someone you love and appreciate them also doesnt seem like relationship advice.

It is horrible, despicable you got raped, however if you continue leaning so hard on your gf, ESPECIALLY stonewalling her, it will end up not working out. There's only so much of your own mental problems you can expect your partner to take before they break and she sounds like a saint.\n\nYou needed help yesterday, and for the love of god, NEVER stay silent. This is someone who obviously cares about you, and you are threatening to cut open the proverbial goose if you rely on her so much. She isn't a rock. She is a human in what sounds like a relatively new relationship and like all humans will eventually get tired of your shit. The number one thing you could do to repay her is to get the help you need to stop being so dependent on her for your emotional stability so she could one day have the same in you because, sorry if I'm being blunt here, she can't have that in you right now.\n\nAgain I only say this because I've been the you here. Take everyone else's advice for the short term in terms of cooking or spa or whatever, but the writing is on the walls here imo; get help because your girlfriend is NOT equipped to deal with the mental illness and the love will only go so far. At the end of the day the people we have to rely on first is our own selves.",

Making him read the label on a can or basically anything is a way to ground him and bring him back to the present. I know you were asking for advice on what to do for your girlfriend, but giving her advice on how to help you when you get like this will also mean the world to her. People like us are natural \"fixers\" and knowing how to help you come out of this state will make her feel great and a little less helpless when it happens. It could also help you.

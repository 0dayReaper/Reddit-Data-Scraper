    "postText": "I matched with this girl on Tinder. She was significantly bigger than girls I normally date. But we have literally everything thing in common so I figured I\u2019d give it a shot. So after talking for a few days we decided to meet up at this nerd bar last night.\n\nI get there and pick a table. After waiting a few minutes this beautiful woman comes over and starts trying to flirt with me. That\u2019s very strange so I assume she must be after something. Free drinks, drugs, my kidneys, I don\u2019t know.\n\nSo I explain to her that I\u2019m actually waiting for someone and I don\u2019t want to give a bad first impression by chatting up some other woman when she walks in.\n\nThat\u2019s when she springs it on me that she\u2019s actually the one I\u2019m waiting for. She told me how she\u2019s lost about 130lbs over the past couple years and she wants to make sure guys are actually interested in her and not just her body.\n\nAnd she was also testing me to see if I would ditch the fat girl if someone hotter showed up. So here\u2019s the thing, I don\u2019t know how I feel about being \u201ctested\u201d. I don\u2019t want to live my life questioning every decision I make like she might jump out from around the corner at any minute.\n\nBut she\u2019s also really attractive and very cool otherwise. I\u2019m not sure how I should proceed.\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t expect this to be downvoted so much. I guess people just prefer the standard \u201cI just walked in on my fianc\u00e9 and my father, brother, and best friend all had their penis\u2019 inside her at the same time. Should I still go through with the wedding?\u201d",

Suddenly losing weight and being valued for your outside can lead to some trust issues. Can you imagine maybe that friend she had for years suddenly trying to sleep with her because she is hot now? Or maybe being ignored at work as the fat girl and now suddenly everyone wants to hear what you have to say because it comes in a pretty package. Her outside package might have improved but she still is the same girl she was before the weight loss. She probably just wants to make sure she is valued for who she is not what she looks like.",

Especially on dating apps, people who actually want relationships have to sift through a lot.  I know a lot of taller guys won\u2019t put their height in their bio for the same reason.\n\nIf your looking for love, nobody wants it to be so shallow.  In her case, women also deal with a lot of people just looking for easy sex.  OP basically just told her he really is looking for a relationship, and he\u2019s not just some playboy looking to fuck anything that talks to him.\n\nPersonally, if you guys have that much in common, I think you should give it a shot.  The whole point of dating is to find out if you\u2019re compatible anyway, right?",

It's easy to see the 'people only care about me because I'm hot now, not because they actually like me' vibe she's giving off.\n\nOP should understand that pretty well too, given how he didn't at any time believe she might actually be into him until she revealed she was the girl from Tinder. \n\nKind of funny really. 'This attractive girl was clearly being nice to try to use me for something since she couldn't possibly actually like me. Then she revealed that she thought that any guy she found attractive would clearly be using her for her looks since they couldn't possibly actually like her. Sounds nuts to me!'",

Drastic weight and appearance changes can really mess with your head if you were overweight for a really long time. For example, I'm only just starting to be able to accept compliments without immediately assuming someone is screwing with me or setting me up for a joke if I respond because that is literally what always followed something like that for *years* for me.\n\nDepending on how long she was that big for (I'd been fat since like middle school), there's probably a lot of not so genuine experiences from others that have her cautious about how people perceive her now but also her new body has her wary about others only seeing the outside rather than actually, truly wanting and appreciating **her** and not just her appearance.",

We talked for a while and I agreed to go out with him.\n\nWhen he drove up for the date I was so incredibly uncomfortable next to him I could barely talk. I wasn't able to talk to him about why I was uncomfortable (that part is on me) but also I wasn't even a little bit attracted to him. I wasn't expecting much but I was really repulsed by his looks, and I didn't know how to tell him I wasn't interested.\n\nHe spent the next year or so messaging me trying to get me to go out with him, convinced we were perfect for each other. I'm not sure what he could possibly have based that on.\n\n(It was several years before I tried to date again.)",

Don't just keep it in and quietly worry about what deception or tests might await you if you guys actually enter into a relationship. Be gentle but be honest. If she is willing to address your concerns then you will know she's worth it. If your feelings are dismissed then it's time to move on.",

I'm happy that I've lost all this weight and have control of my life now, but dating is terrifying. I recently got into Bumble, and I've had a few conversations so far, but every time I see that I have a match, I'm still fairly shocked and in disbelief.\n\nThere's probably going to be a part of me that doubts my self worth and my self-esteem. I only say all of this because I'm confident that this girl is going through the *exact same thoughts about herself.* It's hard for us to just turn the charm when we've never had an opportunity to turn it on in the first place.\n\nI would let it slide.

I don\u2019t care if someone originally had their picture as a skunk ape and then some Abbas Jafri looking dude appeared instead, I\u2019m out. This is a horrible way to start out a relationship.\n\nIt reminds me of an AITA post that got very large and made its rounds in the comments here for a bit about a man who refused to have sex until him and his girlfriend were married. Fast forward to their wedding night and he has a much smaller penis than she thought he would (I think it was like three inches or something) and there were calls for divorce, to run, get a restraining order, \u201cchange your name and flee the country\u201d sort of responses. His reasoning was that many girls had seen his penis before and broke up with him over it. She loved his personality and how they clicked and was happy with him but it was a very clear lie and it wasn\u2019t okay to start their relationship with such a lie. He did it because he was scared of women treating him differently because of this. How is that any different, really?\n\nIt\u2019s never okay to build a relationship on a lie and I see it time and time again here and people are super quick to point out it\u2019s not okay, so why are people defending this one and treating OP like shit because he\u2019s uncomfortable about being lied to in such a way? Whether she is overweight or thin, OP liked her up until she lied to him and I can\u2019t blame him for it even in the least.",

I'm a larger girl myself but this isn't something I would consider doing, it's rude IMO. But, having said that, she'll likely grow out of this behaviour. It won't be a smooth road, she probably won't believe when you tell her that she's attractive, but as you acknowledged there's more to her than her looks and she needs to see herself that way too.",

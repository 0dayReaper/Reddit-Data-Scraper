    "postText": "Please before you attack me with \"that's your EX what did you expect???\", read my story and understand my confusion and feelings.\n\nSo me and him broke up almost 3 months ago, the relationship was nice but at the end we had a lot of fighting and tried to save it. We eventually both got tired of the relationship saving with no progress and I've suggested we should talk in person. He rejected me 5 times, became a totally different, rude person in a spam of a day and forced me to break up with him eventhough all I wanted was a mature conversation. I respected his choice and rejection, never broke no contact and never bothered him again. But hell, it was deffinitely heartbreaking and I felt worthless but I've gotten over it.\n\nMoving forward to these days, I bumped into him twice in a 10 day spam. Our unis are pretty close to eatchother. The first time was casual and just looking at eatchother. But yesterday he literally went to hide from me, avoided me, went of the bus 3 stations before his station just to avoid me, even changing his walking route when he saw me. I know once we become exes we don't exactly hang around and chit chat, but with my other ex we usually politely say hi and move on. You know, indiffence. I've never seen such behavior of an adult and to be fair, I'm a bit shocked. It's been 3 months since the break up, why still be bothered?\n\nI feel a bit weird because I've moved on and would probably just say hi and continue walking. But seeing his extraordinary behaviour to run away from me just makes me wonder what did I do wrong and how could solely my presence make someone so sick to their stomach. Not gonna lie, I did find it pretty funny yet uncomfortable. Next time I guess I'll wait for another bus, eventhough it's not my problem we take the same one.\n\nPlease share your thoughts, I can't explain his behaviour other than pure hatred and disgust, and would love some outside reaction. \nHave a good one!",

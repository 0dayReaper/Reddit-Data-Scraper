    "postText": "[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gnq99t/my_26f_boyfriend_35m_choked_me_until_i_passed_out/)\n\nBefore I get into anything, I am safe, and I am okay and recovering.\n\nThank you to everyone that commented and reached out to me. Your advice and words of wisdom meant so much to me. Well, everyone but the guy that messaged me to tell me that \"guys won't like me\" if I tell them why I broke up with my now ex-boyfriend.\n\nI can't go into a lot of details, but the clinic I went to sent me to the hospital, where I had a full work up done, and met with a DV advocate and police officers. The scale of injuries were severe enough that I was granted an immediate order of protection.\n\nThis was the [last text message](https://imgur.com/a/yaI8A7X) I got from him before I changed my number. I have a feeling that many posters were correct, that this was the test to see how far he could go.\n\nAll of my big things are in storage at my parent's house, and I've been rotating between a couple different friend's houses the past couple of nights. I have plans to move a couple cities over, so I will be as far away from him as possible. My advocate set up an appointment with a therapist, and I met with her this morning.\n\nI'm not sleeping much still, but I am surrounded by good people that will help me get through this.\n\nThank you reddit. The clarity you all gave me probably saved my life.",

Do not believe him. He will do anything and say anything to get you back and to get his power back. \n\nThat last text also screams threat to me. It may not legally qualify as a threat but please be extra careful. It's great that you're already working with a DV agency. Make sure your advocate knows about that last text and the police know about it (especially if he sent it after he was served with the stay away order). \n\nPlease have a safety plan in place (your advocate can help with this) and make sure he never finds out where you are staying. The most dangerous time for a survivor of DV is after they've left the abuser. The abuser has lost their power and are desperate. I don't say this to scare you but to make sure that you and your loved ones take every precaution possible. \n\nYou're stronger than you know. Please take care.\n\nEdit: Just wanted to do a quick edit. Quite a few people are sharing their stories and experiences, thank you!\n\nThere is also a lot of conversation around my comment regarding the last text being a threat but maybe not legally. A threat means different things to different people. It's even more complicated legally because different states have different requirements for something to be a threat. I am not a lawyer. I am just speaking from my very specific experience as a social worker in GA. That's why I say that it feels like a threat but I'm not sure how it will be taken by the legal system.",

I\u2019m not sure about the type of validity testing a habit witness would have to go through. Because a habit witness could also be lying, unless that witness has a conviction against the defendant in the same area of crime the trial is about. \n\nIt seems like this kind of thing would be controversial though. I know some of the judges I have experience with would laugh at habit witnesses and others might let it stand. It doesn\u2019t really have that much of a huge factor on the outcome of a case though, I would imagine. It\u2019s not the strongest type of evidence out there.

Long story short: roughly 4-6 months later he eventually got her to move away with him half a state away just after she turned 18, isolating her from her family and friends. In that time he and I had butted heads over me talking to her at work, him trying to goad me into a fist fight more than once (about that and other things). Anyway she came back like a year ago and seemed happier though she'd obviously gone through some shit. She added me on Facebook after running into eachother at work again. She eventually told me the story of her leaving him after she woke up being choked by him after he'd been drinking. She described how he'd slowly isolated her from any guy acquaintances/ friends at first, then her family, and then her close friends, I remember her saying he'd convinced her she didn't need them anyway and they didn't understand her like he could. She showed me the texts he'd sent when he discovered she'd gone back home to her family and was planning on divorcing him. One month after we'd hung out for the first time, she blocked me out of nowhere and just stopped showing up for work. A few months later one of her friends happened to come into the store said \"she only got back with him because she was afraid of what he'd do if she didn't\". I still don't know what that means.",

Once I worked through everything I realized he\u2019s so fucked up from his parents that he can\u2019t even see straight. We were young, I was 19 and he was 22. He emulated what he saw at home. I will say he is better with our daughter, now. There was a long period where he was a major piece of shit. I mean, I still think he sucks, mostly because he\u2019s just stupid. But our daughter loves him and she\u2019s a complete daddy\u2019s girl. She\u2019s 17 now and lives with him. I raised her with my husband but when she got old enough we let her choose. She gave a very valid, very mature reason for wanting to live with her dad, so we agreed. It wasn\u2019t an easy process nor do I recommend it for everyone in my shoes, but for us it works. She\u2019s thriving in school, she\u2019s popular and is generally a happy kid. \n\nAs for my ex and my relationship now, it\u2019s what it needs to be. He knows I still think he\u2019s a total shit head but he also knows I trust him but I really trust his wife. She\u2019s amazing. Her and I do most of the communicating and parenting. Lol. Idk how he managed to snag her but I\u2019m glad she\u2019s around.",

Their lives hinge on a fake narrative they have created to defend their lies and turn it into reality. They are only ever the good guy and everyone else is evil or just a supporting character in their soap opera lives. If you cannot give them control they will take it, if they can't they will try to destroy you and everyone you've ever loved.\n\nThese ppl turn once they can't get positive attention. They become a psychotic version that lives to cause harm to others lives. They spread lies and will try to turn everyone they know against you.\n\nThese people live to lay waste to anyone who doesn't follow their rules or worship the ground they walk on. They expect that once you are with them, you will never ever date another person ever again.\n\nMy husband's exgf was a narcasisst of the extreme. She cheated on him throughout the relationship. When he found out he planned to leave, but she became pregnant. She moved in but continued to cheat. \n\nWhen he confronted her she turned it against him. She was a hoarder so his house was filled with trash. And she wouldn't let him watch, wear, eat, listen to anything he wanted. She strictly controlled his every movement.\n\nWhen him and I first started dating she was sweet as pie trying to win my (now) husband back even though she was married with 2 kids. She insisted  every week he come to church with her and sit on one side with their son while her husband sat on the other side. They had 50/50 custody, but she decided what he was allowed to do during his parenting week.\n\nWhen he stopped doing her bidding, she decided that she would do whatever she could to break us apart or to ruin our lives. She stalked us, driving by mutiple times a day, damaged our vehicles in the driveway, accoasted me in public leading to a police report. \n\nWe went to court and they finally decide that she was to have no contact with either of us, and all communication was done via email so there would be a record.\n\nIt was a truly fked up time in our lives. My husband is a different person now that he hasn't had to deal with her control and abuse. I would do it all again for him. It just makes me sad that the stepson has to have her as a parent.\n\nIf you ever see narcasisstic signs in someone get tf away from them as far as you can. There is no cure for this behaviour and they will stoop to any means possible to regain control. They absolutely will lay waste to your life.",

The police did nothing other than a few words of advice but did nothing to help her with her abusive ex other than to tell him to stop bothering her, and tell her there is nothing they can do until he does something to actually harm her. Which is bizarre as she was covered in bruises and photographs were taken.  It's so frustrating.  Basically what the police are saying is that he has to harm her so badly that she has to be hospitalized or killed before they will do anything.  No wonder so many women are killed by their ex's/SO's in this country because the police and justice system will do nothing to protect them. It's all so very frustrating.",

Yeah, I like some CNC stuff, but if I get choked out and continued to get done from behind (or wherever) then I'm out. You betrayed my trust by continuing to fuck me like some doll rather than care about my well being and feel bad for making me pass out from not being able to breathe.\nThere's also a huge difference between breath play and choking someone. Some people like it rough and other, like OP, just like their hand on their throat. He knew what she liked and didn't like. To me he took advantage of that situation because OP was in a much vulnerable place due to the position (think about it this way, it's a lot harder to fend someone off of you from behind rather than the front).\nHe also doesn't even sound like a properly trained Dom. Doms are all about trust and the well being of their sub before caring for themselves. OP's ex-bf didn't show any of that. So yeah, kudos to you OP for getting out of that relationship. It obviously was not as healthy as you thought it was and something that I always tell my partners is that my mental state comes first (I have a few mental disorders so I like to make sure that I'm safe/comfy before anything else). Anyways, please, PLEASE, continue therapy. Most people don't realize it but talking to someone who knows nothing about you is so relieving.\nGood luck to you OP, I hope you get better as soon as you possibly can during these tough times.",

There is a risk he will start attempts to manipulate your friends by making up all sorts of stories in order to work out where you are, or where you will be. It\u2019s possible that he will watch fb and other platforms for clues, like special upcoming parties (maybe weddings etc). They could let their guard down, especially face to face. Be wary of who you tell about your final location; they will understand. They need to be cautious in any dealings with him or third parties (he may start to friend people in order to look for evidence of where you are). I have a plan in place with a friend to literally pick her up off the street and move her 200 miles when / if she decides to act and part of that is to scrub fb and other accounts.\n\nRemember: people sometimes ask Reddit \u201cwhere is this building?\u201d And I sometimes think that some of them have picked it up from an ex\u2019s Facebook account, so watch what you post. Even a view of one building can identify your location.\n\nGood luck!",

When a man is abusive, when you speak to other women who have been through the same thing, it's amazing to see the similarities in what those men say. \n\nI have been trying to unravel what happened to me because I was emotionally abused and manipulated by a narcissist who gaslighted me for many years. However, I've had to listen to other people who tell me this, because it's been so difficult to get my head around it and I'm still in therapy working on this. My ex was 48 when we split after 21 years. \n\nI'm thanking you for adding the texts, because they really resonated with me, on a chilling level, but it helped. My ex told no one would want me and went into great detail about how I would lose everything from my job to whatever and he would be sitting back enjoying it. \n\nHe told me he was the rope that held me together. I wish I'd just blocked him, but I did tell him actually he was the rope that held me down. \n\nSo, you've done something helpful for me, in that it is another brick in the foundations to help me realise what I was married to. Abusive people seem to have very similar patterns, even though the abuse might be different. \n\nYou've had a really shocking and frightening experience with someone who has treated you appallingly. The worst thing is that he made it feel like your fault when he had done something so dangerous. I'm really proud of the way you handled this. It takes a lot of courage to take yourself out of a situation, I really admire you. You're right about reddit, I'm sure I would have got out of my relationship very early on had reddit of existed.\n\nPs, also wanted to add, he is completely wrong, you will absolutely thrive without him.",

But I can't help but think that he vetted her. I think that he was looking for someone like op that he could mold and pinch her down to be his perfect victim. I think he enjoyed the whole process. \n\nOp, you are a beautiful and amazing human being. You just went through something so traumatic and it sounds like you were very effective at pushing him out of your life very quickly as well as having a plan to move far away from this psycho.

These password managers can generate a 120+ random char password that will be impossible to guess by any one. \n- Add a second factor authentication method (2fa) to as many account as you can to ensure he can not log in without physically having your phone (best technique is with authy or Google authenticator, avoid SMS if you have better choices). \n- Close all unused accounts in general, recreate other accounts of possible. Make all your accounts private to prevent stalking. \n- Avoid reusing the same username, go for something random where it does not matter.\n- Make sure some older shared accounts are no longer accessible to him (Netflix, Icloud, Spotify, for instance).\n\nIf he is tech savvy enough, some more extreme measures might be necessary (format computer, user Tor to browse internet,...) you can send me a DM if you want more precision or help with these stuff",

But immediate orders of protection or temporary or emergency orders of this nature (different states have different lingo) usually do not last more than a few weeks. Talk to your DV advocate about pro bono legal resources. You want to get a lawyer, you want to go back to court for a full hearing, and you want to get an order of protection that lasts at least a year. \n\nSave all your text messages, take any photos you can of the injuries, get copies of any documents created by the police and the emergency room, and ask your friends who you went to immediately after the incident if they would be willing to provide statements to your attorney (once you get one). Your attorney will get this put together into a persuasive package to help you secure a long term protection order. \n\nThis is not something to screw around with.

THOSE are the kind of men who make good partners and friends and their actions verify you on every level. Sometimes its easy to convince oneself that maybe you should doubt your own thoughts even when you know that you are right. You have these other people and men to remind you in those dark moments that men are good, and that men WILL support you. Men who don't know you helped you in perhaps what is the most chaotic your life has gotten if were going to pretend that text held any meaning at all. Your life will never be more chaotic and people helped you. So. Hes wrong, we knew he was but we have proof too.",

    "postText": "\nI\u2019ll try to make this short, but I met my girlfriend about 6-7 months ago and we have been mutually exclusive from the rip, and started dating a little under 6 months ago.\n\nShe\u2019s genuinely the most attractive girl I\u2019ve ever been with, super pretty, and we\u2019re both really into fitness. We can pretty much do anything together and have fun.\nWe hangout about 1-2 times a week and she genuinely is my best friend. \n\nThe main issue I\u2019ve been having is that while she\u2019s my best friend and I really do love her, I\u2019m not in love with her. While the relationship has been nice so far, it hasn\u2019t felt right. Instead of building up something together it feels like she\u2019s just looking for someone to look nice and give her tons of affirmations. Instead of going through tough times together it feels as though she\u2019s the first one to bail, and while I\u2019m in this relationship with her it doesn\u2019t feel like the dynamic that would last multiple years.\n\n\nWith that being said on a day to day basis everything was going great but over the past month or so there have been a few incidents where she has broken down because I do not show affection enough. This is mainly because she relies heavily on words of affirmation, and I\u2019ve always struggled with it. This was also something she brought up in the past, and while I think I\u2019ve progressed since then, she says she needs 100% right now. Among other things she told me that she knows what she is worth and won\u2019t wait for me to improve gradually. \n\nWhile I think she is right to some extent, I felt the way it was presented added to the issues of the relationship. For example not feeling like we are working towards something together with hardships along the way, but instead her looking for specific positive things and willing to throw everything away because she was not receiving the compliments she liked. After this conversation I got much better at complimenting and forcing myself to do something I\u2019ve been uncomfortable with most of my life. I\u2019ve been more affectionate than ever and while she\u2019s been nice it truly does feel the past few weeks of thin ice has drained the actual love from this relationship. Is this one of those situations where things need to end and short term discomfort will turn into long term peace, or am I naive and am about to fumble such a hot gf.\n\nTLDR: girlfriend super perfect on paper, but I feel like she is in relationship only for personal satisfaction. Combined with prob some of my fault too I think the result is a relationship between two people that really care about each other, but aren\u2019t in love with each other.",

I mean, you are still in your early twenties, you can still do a lot so breaking up for any reason should be ok.\n\nEdit: You don\u2019t really need to give any valid reason, if it doesn\u2019t feel right then it doesn\u2019t feel right. Just make sure you communicate this clearly to your GF so you don\u2019t leave her in the dark.",

    "postText": "It\u2019s been a long night. Thank you all for staying patient. Also this will be an immensely long post, so buckle in.\n\nFirst off I just want to say thank you for the massive outpouring of support and love. I\u2019m still trying to work through all of your PM\u2019s because I\u2019d like to respond personally to each of you who were kind enough to send me loving words of support. I have been pretty overwhelmed by the amount of people who have commented and through reading every last one of your thoughts. I never imagined this post would gain nearly this level of traction and visibility and it\u2019s my hope that if I can provide some description of the course of legal action taken and what advice I used from Reddit users, other unfortunate partners who stumble upon CP and find this thread (at least in Canada) will have some idea of what recourse they can take.\n\nI also want to state that for anybody who doubts the validity of my claims, I understand. This is an absolutely fucking insane sequence of events and as much as I wish I had the energy to make something like this up for some arbitrary Karma, I don\u2019t. To provide proof I have sent photographs of identifications and the related arrest paperwork to mods and have worked with them to verify all of what I have written.\n\nYesterday I was picked up by my best friend Alex around 2:30. We drove around and talked for a while. I went to school, discovered it was closed (my scatterbrain completely forgot about spring break) and then we went back to his house to discuss all of the comments you had been leaving and come up with a course of action. We drank, talked and after a few hours took a short break from staring at my phone to play some apex. \n\nAlex dropped me back off at my house around 930. David was home, in my room, and immediately I noticed how he was exceptionally quiet and distant. He said he had to admit something to me. I prepared for him to admit to possessing CP but instead he told me about how he had taken some photos of me sleeping; he felt really embarrassed about it but he just didn\u2019t know how to bring it up. I feigned surprise and asked him if he had anything else on his phone he wanted to admit to me. He  said no. I asked him to look me in the eyes and tell me that, and he did. I don\u2019t know why I was hoping so badly that he would be honest with me about the CP but I really thought he\u2019d admit to it then and there. Instead he admitted he had been feeling suicidal the last few months but didn\u2019t think he would act on it. He asked me if that changed my perception of him and I said no. He grew quiet again and I left to go shower. When I came back he was getting changed and said he was going to walk for a bit and grab some food. It was about 1030 at this point. When he left, I finally lost it and broke down. I grabbed my cat and hugged him and cried and cried and cried. I was so tired and wanted to shut my brain off so badly. \n\nI grabbed my phone and dialed the non emergency RCMP line for my city. Shaking and crying I explained to the lady on the phone that I had discovered CP on my boyfriend\u2019s phone. She put me through to the report line and I spoke to another Constable who told me I would be contacted by another officer who would provide more details. I waited for around 10 minutes. The officer advised me that he would need me to come in and provide a recorded audio/video statement. I asked if I could do it over the phone and he said no, it must be done in person so that if this goes to court, Crown Counsel has clear evidence that I was not coerced into stating what I witnessed. I don\u2019t have my full licence yet and because of the late time I wasn\u2019t able to make it down there on my own via transit so the cons table said he would come pick me up, asked me if David was there and if I could safely leave without arousing suspicion. Luckily David knows about my close family-like relationship with my best friend, so I made up a lie about how my best friend got in a fight with his dad and he wanted to talk to me about it. David didn\u2019t seem to question it and I waited for the officer to arrive. \n\nHe called me from a blocked number and I walked outside and down the block to his SUV. The constable and another officer greeted me,  I got into the front seat and we drove to the station. During the ride I asked him about whether seizing the phone on my own was a good idea. He explained that I had done everything correctly; laying low and getting my thoughts together to take it to police without notifying David. He said if I had taken David\u2019s phone on my own that it would not have been admissible as evidence in court; they would have returned it back to him and he could have deleted all the evidence since suspicion had been roused. It was about 11:15 at this point. They placed me in an interview room and I sat and waiting for about twenty minutes. The officer came back in and explained the process of the interview, that it would take some time and to be as thorough as possible with my answers. He said we could take breaks and brought me some water.\n\n He started off by asking me details about my life, where I grew up, past employment etc. After that portion he asked me about David, what our relationship was like, whether he was nice and kind to me and anything else I knew about him. I told him he was sweet, that he had been nothing short of lovely in the time we\u2019d been together but I did express that things had been moving very quickly. He agreed. He then got me to explain how I came upon the photos in question, so I did. Then came the worst part. He asked me to go through, one at a time, the photos I explicitly remembered details of seeing and to describe it in very, very graphic detail. ie positions of the children, their ethnicity, any identifying characteristics such as clothing, circumcision etc. It was intense but by some grace of God I was able to keep my composure and not burst into tears (mental/emotional exhaustion was fully setting in and I was almost thankful for not having energy to bawl) and provide a clear statement to the officer. He asked me if I would testify in court and I said I would. The officer left a few times during the interview to discuss with his supervisor more questions to ask during the interview and the legalities of the seizure they would attempt. The full interview took around three hours including all the sitting and waiting.\n\nAfter I had been sitting for what felt like an eternity the officer came in and explained that they felt my interview provided enough reasonable cause to seize his phone and place him under arrest. They explained how the process would go and whether I wanted a no contact agreement.  I said yes initially but the officer asked me if it would be easier to not have one in regards to sorting out his belongings. That made sense to me so I chose not to move forward with the no contact agreement. \n\nWe got in the constable\u2019s car and drove down to my house with 2 other officers in 2 different vehicles, 3 in total. I told them I was more comfortable in a squad car than standing outside (I didn\u2019t want to face him) so they moved me to the back of the cop car. I\u2019ve never felt so anxious in my life. I asked them to be mindful of my cats and not let them get outside; they promised they would make sure of that. About 15 minutes later I saw them bringing David out in handcuffs. My heart which had been dissolving in my stomach\u2019s acid all day felt completely gone. I curled up in the fetal position in the back of the squad car and waited to be told I could go back inside. After another eternity (my phone had died by this point but I know it was well past 330) they came back and explained he was under arrest but being released with promise to appear in court at a later date. I was told by the officer I could go back in, and that they would help him find his way back to the place he had been staying previously. The officer gave me a victim services card and a hug and instructed me to snuggle my cats tightly, that I did a brave thing and to be well. \n\nI went back into my house, put Planet Earth on for background noise and called my other best friend Paige who had been keeping up with me about this since I sent her my reddit post. We were talking for almost 45 minutes when my door burst open. It was David. He was frantic, his eyes were wild and he was hyperventilating. My jaw dropped; officers said they would be escorting him back to his prior residence and I was not at all mentally prepared to see him again. Paige asked me if everything was okay and I told her David had walked through the door, I would call her back. Immediately David came to the bed where I was sitting, dropped to his knees and sobbed violently. He said he didn\u2019t know I would be here, he just came to grab a couple more of his belongings. He asked me what the cops had asked myself or told me. I lied and said that they said they had only told me they had suspicions of possession of child pornography. He sobbed more and loudly said \u201cThat isn\u2019t me, that isn\u2019t me, this isn\u2019t who I am\u201d and cried more and more. His body was wracked with sobs and he apologized over and over again. It was immensely difficult to witness and I wish I could have told him to get the fuck out but I just sat there immobilized, in shock. It was well close to 5 in the morning and I hadn\u2019t slept or eaten much in nearly 48 hours at this point so my body and brain felt like they were essentially non-functioning. \n\nDavid began and said that this had been something he struggled with after developing an intense porn addiction in his early 20s. I asked him if he had ever been abused sexually and he said no. He said he knew how horrible it was to seek these images out, but had no inclination or desire to ever touch any children, he had never acted on these thoughts and never would. I asked him why he had never sought treatment before, and he admitted that he was terrified of what people would think, he had no idea what resources to access and he felt ashamed. He said his previous suicide attempts in years prior were directly linked to the fact that he considered himself a pedophile. I nodded. I asked him if they would find anything on his phone that would incriminate him and he said yes, they were going to. He admitted they were very explicit photos and I asked how he even found them; I don\u2019t recall we ever got to that. He promised me he didn\u2019t use my internet to access it but I don\u2019t really believe that. He apologized to me more times than I could count and asked if I hated him. I told him I wasn\u2019t sure that I felt hatred for him but I was sure of being beyond disappointed in his actions; I told him how terribly I felt betrayed and hurt and violated. I expressed my sadness in what he had done, the innocence of these exploited children, how he had so much potential to do so much good in the world and how disappointed this was the route he chose.  \n\nThen I heard a loud knock on the door and lights outside my windows. Three officers were outside, two of whom I recognized from earlier and they asked me if David was here. I said he was, and they said they were coming to perform a wellness check because Paige had called in. I realized I had completely forgotten to text her back and let her know I was okay, bless her heart. The officers took David outside and they each asked him if they had any cause to worry about his actions tonight and he promised them they did not. I told them I was okay; that I would finish my discussion with him and if I had any issues I had them on speed dial. They nodded and left. \n\nDavid sobbed and sobbed for what felt like a millennium and I just sat and well, endured it. Tears just ran and ran and ran from him. He said he knew what he was saying was cliche; that he was sure I expected to hear this great big apology. He said if I thought he was being manipulative he could understand but assured me he was at his rock bottom and wanted me to know how horrible he felt about not only what he\u2019d done, but what I had to go through. I just nodded. There was silence for a long time, I think by this point it was around 8 or 830 in the morning. I don\u2019t know how long I stared at my TV screen that said \u201cAre you still watching: Planet Earth?\u201d but it could have been a lifetime. I had no concept of time or what to do or say or what was the right way to feel. I think David was either silent or had fallen asleep against my bed. I didn\u2019t know or care, I was just numb. I would have probably sat like that until I died but two of my four cats descended on my bed and meowed for food. I got up, fed my little critters and cats and came back to my bed. My brain wasn\u2019t capable of thought so I stared at my tv screen until I passed out sometime around 9. \n\nI didn\u2019t sleep for long because when I woke up and checked my phone it said 11:30. David was awake and crying still. When he realized I was awake he sat up and looked at me immensely pained. I just stared at him. He started apologizing and apologizing more. He expressed his life was over, he had nobody and nothing and that I was his greatest light in life, how he never wanted to lose me. He expressed how much he cared about me and how he would do anything to win my affections back; to get me to give him a second chance. I shook my head and he sobbed, sobbed, sobbed,  apologizing non-stop. At this point I finally asked him to leave. I told him I needed space to sort out my emotions, and I needed to get some sleep.  I asked him if he would be okay. He nodded and grabbed his things. He said he would get out of my life and not contact me if that\u2019s what I wanted him to do. I said nothing. He expressed how much he loved me and again how sorry he was, and that if there was every any chance of anything happening between us ever again that he would be there. He said I love you about ten million times and grabbed his bag and stepped out of my door.\n\nI\u2019ve been laying in bed since then and writing this. I just want this to be over. I just want to move on and figure out how to sort the mess that remains. Also I think I forgot to add that his court date is set for June. As far as sentencing, if he\u2019s found guilty of possession of child pornography I believe he could be sentenced to 18 months max and a minimum sentence of 90 days.  I will post updates again if I feel  they are important; otherwise I will update again in June when he has been sentenced and let you know what charges are laid.\n\nThank you all again for your support, kindness, and love. I have never in my life experienced such an outpouring of generosity and compassion and I would have been so lost without some of your advice. I\u2019ll continue working on replying to your PM\u2019s, but in the meantime I think I\u2019m going to try and finally get some god damned sleep.\n\nTLDR: Filed a secondary report over the phone, provided a audio/video interview to police and they arrested David and seized his phone. He signed a promise to appear in court in June. He awaits sentencing. \n\n",

If you've been careful about how you store information on your phone (e.g. making sure what you save is not backed up to the cloud) then there are ways to make sure things your delete can not be retrieved in any way. This is assuming you're storing things \"in the clear\" rather than encrypting it, because if you encrypt and keep your keys secure then even if you don't delete the information it becomes practically impossible to decrypt that information (assuming you're using a good algorithm).",

Most phones these days have encryption turned on by default, so factory wiping your phone would be sufficient to prevent access to anything. The chances are even better if it's an android phone and you can use fastboot/recovery to manually wipe everything, or you physically disintegrate the device. That said, if the information got leaked earlier to some online service (eg. you accidentally synced the photo to google photos), then yeah you're fucked.",

David's case represents the paraphillic side of that mental disorder spectrum. I won't go into the subtle issues and responses that come with this disorder, I only urge everyone to not see it as inherently bad, just something that can be worked on and not feared or labeled.\n\nMost people with this disability never act on it. A few search for images, or 'hentai', or what have you. Nearly all of these persons can receive help which will allow them to live a more normal life. In fact, many of them likely live a normal life with this one exception. Do not hate and label those who suffer, hate the act, hate the distribution, and do not shun those who need help.\n\nNow I am not saying what OP did was wrong, I only wish to spread what I believe we should do for what is right for the people who need help. This is especially true with taboo subjects like Child Pornography or pedophilia, where the stigma is so strong that those who suffer fear the help that can be provided. After all, even those found innocent often live with that label in some fashion. Help, don't hinder, to create a less brutal and more understanding world.",

He has a gross porn fantasy/fetish, and thinks of himself as a pedophile. But he also said he\u2019d never ever act on it in real life, and based on OPs account of the story it sounds believable...\n\nThink of it this way. There\u2019s tons of people into rape porn, but they\u2019d never ever act on it. They have a fetish for the role play cause it\u2019s a dominance thing, but the thought of actually putting another person through that is HORRIFYING, and a whole different issue. Fantasy porn is different than what someone would do in real life.\n\nOf course, child porn is different cause of how it\u2019s made. It\u2019s sick and twisted and promotes people who make that shit.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean David would actually put a child through that, and congratulating OP for catching a \u201cfuture pedophile\u201d doesn\u2019t sit right with me. David\u2019s sick, but give him the benefit of the doubt that he wouldn\u2019t cross that line...\n\nProbably an unpopular opinion, but since David hasn\u2019t done anything maliciously, I think he needs psychiatric help, not jail time. Everyone has flaws, and David\u2019s happens to be really really huge, but that doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t normal in every other way of life. He\u2019s not a crazy psycho murderer, or someone who sexually assaults people. He recognizes that he has a fetish for something horrible, and hates himself. He knows it, and he\u2019s been tempted to commit suicide rather than be who he is. That\u2019s someone who can be helped.\n\nFor a first offense of possession over illegal porn I don\u2019t think he deserves jail - that\u2019s a label you live with for the rest of your life. It\u2019s mentally damaging, and can drive people to depression. Imagine knowing you\u2019ll never be more than an ex convict. But with therapy and psychiatric care, David might become better...\n\nEDIT: I forgot about David taking pictures of OP, and I definitely think possessing child porn in the first place is horrible. David\u2019s pictures of OP are disturbing and make me question his character, but I think mentally sick people should have the chance to rehabilitate first with mandated therapy instead of jail. He didn\u2019t commit assault (except maybe on OP), so if he\u2019s registered as a sex offender it should only be because of what he did with her",

There are already trials and projects testing and seeing how their drugs cure addictions that caused deep rooted damage and changes to the brain. Basically a reset in a sense.\n\nThe more we learn about our brains, the more we can move to remove such behaviors. But then comes a whole new discussion about predetermined values required for newborns and how such \"minimization of violent or deviant behaviors\" would affect art.\n\nAnyways im hopeful for the future.\n\nAs for the death sentence wanters, I understand their views and I personally believe that if a individual is judged to have abused children sexually they should (by level of severity):\n\n1. Medical castration and min of 10 year imprisonment.\n2. Physical castration and 30 year imprisonment.\n3. Physical castration and life in prison.\n4. Death.\n\nIt may seem harsh, but the current lack of proper imprisonment of people involved with sexual abuse of children is absurdly light. There are individuals who abuse children for years and get out in 6-months - 2 years. half if good behavior. Carry a 0.3g joint and its jail for 6 years but rape a child for years 6months - 2 years. Its just sad. \n\n",

And I also agree psychiatric help is the way to go, I don't agree he shouldn't serve jail time for a first offense of possession of CP. It's not just illegal porn, it's CP.\n\nHe still needs to be accountable for his own choices and actions. Instead of seeking treatment, even though I can sympathize with how frightening that thought could be, due to stigma, he did not.  He could have also chosen *not* to follow through on seeking out CP. Or downloading it. And from what OP states, it was very explicit - including penetration. David may not have harmed those children himself, but he's supporting it by searching for it and downloading it and keeping it.\n \nLet's also not forget what he actually *did* do to OP - taking non-consensual pictures of her naked body while she was sleeping. Including placing her hand down his pants. That *is* sexual predatory action actually followed through with. So, while I don't think it's a sure bet he *would* progress to doing more than he's already done, he *has* already taken sexually predatory actions toward OP while she was asleep. So that tells me he *is* absolutely capable of taking actions on his urges, as he already has. \n\nI fully support jail time for first time offenders of CP possession. I'm not saying someone can't be helped or rehabilitated - they absolutely should be given that chance. But CP is one of the most heinous things and you *are* contributing to actual harm of these children and future children when you seek it out, even if you didn't do it yourself. This is one of those crimes that does need to be harsh for first time offenders. I think mandatory psychiatric treatment is needed as well.\n\nI have far more empathy for someone who may have these urges, but does not ever take *any* harmful actions. And I agree if they seek out help without ever having done anything wrong - they should not be stigmatized or punished or treated as criminals. Once you cross the line, you should be held accountable for your actions.",

I mean, the fact that the most assured way to get into therapy is to actually give into your urges is fucked up.

This means that they can choose to go above their base instincts and do the right thing. I don't think paedophiles can stop wanting to rape children, but I think they can stop thinking it's ever acceptable and can stop thinking that they're doing anything other than hurting the kids they abuse. \n\nIt also means they can choose to _not_ rise above it, and can choose to do what makes them selfishly happy at the expense of the innocence, life, and safety of children either around them or in their care. Getting them into the justice system facilitates their treatment, and that's great, but it also means that if they choose not to follow that treatment then they will be found and captured before they are able to hurt many more children. It's a win-win to have a system like that. ",

There really could be nothing for him regardless of where he goes. There isn\u2019t a way to admit that to someone unless you have some you trust absolutely, and most people don\u2019t really have someone they trust on that level. On top of that, if something like that gets out, there is basically 0 way to recover from that, even if you are the most sorry wretch on earth and pay your dues 7 times over. The internet just won\u2019t let him forget. I mean, all of us now are talking about him, if that\u2019s any indication of the potential permanence this label could have on him. \n\nI genuinely don\u2019t want to take away from OP\u2019s courage. What she did was the right thing to do. She doesn\u2019t have the resources or training to deal with this, and that is a very shocking, appalling, and unbelievable thing to find out about someone. It is a potentially trust and relationship ending revelation, which it was in this case. \n \nBut it also makes me glad to hear this guy will actually get meaningful treatment for this, and I genuinely hope it would be better than whatever paltry offering we may have here in the states (the state of our mental healthcare and prison systems is... lacking, to say the least).\n\nThey don\u2019t have to get back together ever, but I genuinely hope that, if they ever see each other again, he\u2019s in a better place.

I can tell you there's things I'd prefer not to disclose on such a public forum that are also utilized to catch these people, but rest assured they *are* found and they *are* punished, and more importantly, children *do* get saved from this. I only wish more culprits were in jurisdictions that had the death penalty for stuff like this though. My colleagues and I have had... Interesting... conversations as to what would happen in a closed room with these people. But to help reassure you, the nexuses of the stuff aren't many, and most of it gets funneled through known locations. More or less it's generally few people publishing it. The bad news is the ones who don't publish or record it are the ones that (obviously I'm not involved in) are more numerous. I have seen more than I care to of child rape, and to be frank even the reports we write and review are too much, but there are a lot of good people out there who put their sanity at risk looking at this shit to catch the bastards and save the kids.

Yes, we can still apply empathy and intellectual rigor to our judgements of his character.

I highly suggest therapy for yourself to put what has happened in perspective and have a safe space to work through your feelings. Now that he has gotten his things, apply for a protection order, get the locks changed, and look into a video doorbell. Also inform the officers that he admitted to taking pictures of you while asleep without your consent, and that you do not know the nature of said pictures or where he has them stored, but that him using them for revenge porn is a possibility. His coming back to the house was very staged. There is no reason for him not to believe you wouldn't be in your own home. The mentioning of being suicidal, the overdone apology, the making you out to be the sole thing keeping him going, all is extremely manipulative. It also sounds like he did it to find out how much you knew. Block him on everything. Any contact he makes is to be handed over to the police and not responded to. Never let him in the house. If he has anything else at your place, he can get it with a police escort. Take your phone to the phone company and have it checked for GPS tracking. Might even ask the police to check. Check and be ready to hand over any computers, ipads, etc to police. Watch your back. He may, in his desperate state, stalk you. Talk to a victim's advocate on how to protect yourself. I am sorry his shit choices have put you in this position. You did the right thing, but it being right does not make it easy. I wish you luck and healing, and that he get the max sentence possible and sentenced for every picture in his possession. Consecutively. ",

You were violated, physically and emotionally, and your trust and sense of safety have been shattered. None of this is your fault. You discovered something horrific and you handled in in literally the best way you possibly could have, save not getting that no contact order. \n\nOn that note: DO NOT LET HIM CONTACT YOU. FROM THIS POINT ON HE IS DEAD TO YOU. Pointing out how he's \"acting like such a cliche\" and saying that he's \"not trying to be manipulative\" is textbook manipulation for sad asshats who have ruined themselves. \n\nHe isn't sorry for what he did, he's sorry that he has to face the consequences. I repeat, HE ISN'T SORRY FOR WHAT HE DID, HE'S SORRY HE HAS TO FACE THE CONSEQUENCES. That goes for the photos of you AND the CP. \n\nYou are hurt and sad and scared and confused and I cannot possibly begin to comprehend what you may be going through. But right now, your main priority is you. Take some time off work, get out of town for a bit, go somewhere to recalibrate. If you can't do that, then self care is the name of the game. Anything that makes you happy, do it in spades. Surround yourself with positive people, it sounds like you already have some excellent friends watching out for you. Consider seeing a mental health professional, even if just one time. And whatever you do, do not let your pain and suffering convince you that staying in contact with David or possibly trying to salvage your relationship is anything but the worst idea ever. I know that sounds like a super obvious thing to say, but trauma has a way of making really shitty ideas seem reasonable. \n\nAnd don't stress about the court date that is to come. It sounds like he's probably gonna plead guilty, given that they have his phone with CP on it, but the prosecutors will prepare you for the stress of that. You've already given your statement, and if you remember anything else, give it to them and don't dwell on it, as best you can. \n\nAgain, you are a victim here. You might be tempted to ignore that in the light of the fact that you aren't the only victim, but you are a victim. And part of getting past that is acknowledging and accepting that it was not your fault. Good luck with everything there is to come, and know that there's a cat dad in Orlando who is sending you all of the good vibes and mental support he possibly can. ",

You have done nothing wrong and have acted correctly, but with what you've seen, you're not going to *feel* right.\n\nBeen through it myself too; Years ago, I accidentally ran into some CP on the eMule network; a system that doesn't allow you to see the file before it's downloaded, and it was named as if it were a famous movie. I reported that in too, but I remember stammering and finding it hard to describe because I was in a state of shocked disgust. I still wince thinking about it now.\n\nWhat matters is doing the right thing, even though it's horrible to have to do so. And you did. So I salute you.",

When I first finished University I could not get a job in my direct field so I worked as a computer tech in a small shop. Ended up finding a customer with CP on their computer and with the help of my social worker wife (for support and advice) and some amazing coworkers, I too called the RCMP.\n\nThat was 17 years ago. I can still picture in my mind the one image I saw. There were many more and stories and such. But it only took one photo for me to burn it into my brain. I now have two young girls of my own, whenever I think about that image and that small innocent girl who had her childhood shattered, fuck 17 years later and I will still cry over it. I talked to my wife a lot and though it still hurts and I will never forget that image... \n\nI hope the images don't burn in your mind forever, but in the event that you have a similar reaction as I did, please talk to someone. Family worked for me, but professionals are available and wonderful for this kind of thing. Being Canadian there are some options to get the costs covered. Just don't let it fester. The images are sad and scary, but it was not your fault and you were a hero in this situation. \n\nThe pictures themselves will often go into evidence for use by officiers in larger investigations. They may end up finding the original photographers as a result. You will never hear about it but one day the news will report on a massive CP ring being arrested and broken up. When that day comes, take pride in knowing that you may have helped the cause and know that society thanks you. \n\nGood job. (now I have to wipe my tears and hug my girls)",

We continued to date for another 2 years (he went through extensive therapy and I do believe he changed) and broke up last year for reasons aside from this.  I will offer my 2 biggest pieces of advice from my experience:\n\nFirst: Seek therapy, I cannot express how much of an emotional relief it will be to talk about this experience with an unbiased 3rd party. My therapist is actually one who treats sexual offenders so that was helpful for me (she knew what he is going through and was able to help me kind of pop my hero-complex bubble that I had created), but any type would be so so helpful!  \n\nSecondly: The hardest part for me was navigating the current of EXTREME opinions that people had. This was someone I loved and cared about and once I spoke a few key words about his behavior the shift in attitude from my family and friends went from spiteful (as if he'd cheated on me) to downright... vileness, and even that is lightly put. In your case, you saw him at his most vulnerable (crying and sobbing and apologizing) and you feel sympathy for the person he is despite the admitted atrocities he has committed, and that can be quite jarring. Don't be surprised at the amount of pure vitriol people will express, if you revealed he was a serial killer there would be less hate.  \n\nPM me if you want to talk about it more, but definitely get some sleep first!

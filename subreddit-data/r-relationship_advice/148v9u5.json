    "postText": "My boyfriend and I come from different backgrounds. I'd say my life has gone from unlucky to lucky. I had a very poor upbringing and later in life I got to go to school and travel a bit. My partner on the other hand has had the opposite? He grew up being coddled by his family, and now that I live with him he pays rent to live at his dad's house (I also pay the exact same rent) we both have jobs, I've kept the same one since moving here, and he has had two, one he laid off from. \n\nCoincidentally he also screwed himself out of having a reference on his resume because his boss wasn't impressed with his attendance. Because all he did/ still does is take sick days. That doesn't really bother me much, but it's the fact that I have to hear about how he doesn't have any money, anytime he wants some new game or new hobby. Like his grandmother sends him money, and instead of using it as emergency money he goes off and buys a fucking mandolin.\n\nWe both have pretty bad spending habits to be fair. I always want to go out for a drink or buy art shit online. He spends all of his money on video games, he can't wait a year or wait for it to be on sale he needs it immediately so he can give people advice on it. Like I love this mf with all me heart but holy shit the fact that he will literally hide shit from me now pisses me off so much. But I also understand why he hides it from me, because he knows I'll just get mad at him.\n\nI want to move into an apartment with him in town, and I want to go to school and have a skilled job. I just feel like he's no where close to saving anything up or even have the mentality for it.  And that usually leads to me thinking that I'm just using him, because I keep asking myself why I even stay here. I want it to work out so much, like I was never good at explaining my feelings, but he'd be good at helping me use my voice. \n\nI just can't stand when he goes on about \"I can't believe I have to work just to live\" then I suggest that we live off-grid and says \"oh but I can't live without wifi\" \ud83d\ude2d or the \"do you think it's unfair that we have to pay rent?\" Even though that's rent, food, electricity, water for dirt cheap. \n\nI love him so much but we're so different. I feel like he's going to have a rude awakening whenever his Dad decides that he needs to move out. I know it isn't my job to fix him, but he's going to end up homeless and alone",

            "comment": "Yeah I have trouble with people who are like this too.\n\nI can't give advice because I have never found a solution for how I react to it either.\n\nI think part of it is personality.  What I mean is, you are probably like me in that I grew up poor and had to become extremely independent at a young age, so that means I learned to do things like manage money.  I'm so independent I fall into the \"avoidant attachment style\" group, so it is extremely important to me to be self-sufficient, I don't even like to be emotionally entangled with other people, much less be entangled in terms of finances, etc.\n\nBut I do understand on some level that not everyone is like that, they don't have that background.  Lots of people in the world rely on other people, they negotiate, there is give and take, they give some things, take others, etc.  I'm not wired like that, but a lot of people are wired like that.\n\nI admit, it's very hard not to be judgemental about it.  When I see how much some people rely on others, or have so much privilege, etc, and don't appreciate what they are given, it comes across as extremely childish to me, and I have trouble having empathy for it.\n\nLike I said, not much advice I can give, let me know if you solve it.",

I think my options are either to move on, or get therapy lol \nLike I can't really form any sort or relationship with stable people, like \"oh you have a stable family? and good up bringing? Well be prepared for the most dry convos about the weather, because I think your weak little btch brain couldn't handle a single complex thought, about literally anything else, other than the little clouds in the sky\"",

Don't feel bad about leaving him, when you do, you'll be doing him a favor. It'll be the first in a long serious of reality checks before he realizes what life is all about. Focus on your dreams and your career, because he won't.",

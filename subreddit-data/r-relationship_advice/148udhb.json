    "postText": "I'm interested in being friends. He might want something more, idk. I don't prefer to date men over 24. \n\nLike the title suggests, how do I respond to his text? I was thinking \"generally, no\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.\" But idk if that sounds mean. I want to be nice about this. \n\nHere's the back story: I met him at his job. He helped me buy a car and he asked for my number. We plan to grab food soon. I just got out of an abusive relationship, so I might be missing signs here. \n\nHere's the link: https://imgur.com/a/dXsfLw7",

He's already proved his lack of character by hitting on a client. His lack of professional ethics almost certainly means he doesn't have many personal ethics either. Just tell him you've reconsidered and if he presses the issue don't be shy about threatening to tell his employer that he hit on you when you went in to buy a car.",

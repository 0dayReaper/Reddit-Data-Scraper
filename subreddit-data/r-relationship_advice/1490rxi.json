    "postText": "my bf and i dated for 8 months and he ghosted me and suddenly broke up with me a day later. i tried to talk to him but he didn\u2019t want to talk until we met up in person again. it\u2019s been a few weeks since then and he\u2019s reached out and i\u2019ve reached out just for banter, even called me a few times to see if i\u2019m okay but i can slowly feel him losing more and more interest idk if that\u2019s because i have an anxious attachment style or he\u2019s just not interested anymore. i didn\u2019t understand where i went wrong in the relationship so i kept reaching out to him for answers but he told me that he doesn\u2019t have the answers right now. since then i\u2019ve been working towards improving myself and understanding him better. i want to get back with him eventually but i\u2019m scared he doesn\u2019t want the same thing. at some points hes even said to me \u201ci thought we\u2019re still together\u201d or \u201clet\u2019s take a break\u201d or \u201ci wanna be in a relationship with u but i don\u2019t know\u201d but then other times he\u2019s like \u201cI just feel alot pressure to be in a relationship. And im not in a good head space rn. And i just dont know if i want to be in a serious relationship rn\u201d and it\u2019s a bit confusing but i can understand where he\u2019s coming from. he\u2019s an avoidant so it\u2019s a bit harder to understand them as their issues are rooted to their childhood. we still talk here and there and he still helps me with things but i want to get back with him because it was genuinely such a good relationship and i\u2019m not sure how to approach it or what to do. any advice would be appreciated thank u\n\nedit: currently i\u2019m going no contact with him but it\u2019s hard for me and i think the reason why he ended things was because he was dealing with a lot in terms of work and he felt like he needed to give me time and attention which he just wasn\u2019t able to do. which isn\u2019t true, i wish he just communicated with and i would\u2019ve pulled back to give him space.",

Also working on improving yourself shouldn\u2019t be for him but for yourself only. Just leave him alone, work on yourself for yourself and just move on with life. If it\u2019s meant to be it\u2019ll be but don\u2019t pressure him bc you\u2019ll catch him on a bad day and will hear what you don\u2019t wanna hear.",

    "postText": "My girlfriend(28F) is very sensitive\n\nMy girlfriend is very sensitive. It\u2019s really getting to the point where I feel like I have to walk on eggshells. Recently we were texting and talking sexually. I jokingly said to her that we only have sex on Thursdays only because the last 2-3 times were all on Thursdays. I meant nothing from it and laughed it off. She told me that I was throwing shade and it was weird of me to say. I then let her know that I was joking and meant nothing by it. She went on to bring up how about a year or so ago I told her that I felt she was no longer attracted to me because we weren\u2019t as active sexually 3 years into the relationship as we were when we first started dating. It did bother me but I was able to get over the situation. I found out today that she was not over that situation and she said it hurt her that I felt that way. I first thought she was being defensive but she said she\u2019s SENSITIVE. I respectfully told her that she can be sensitive but I shouldn\u2019t have to deal with that and now knowing that what is a joke to me is a trigger to her, I feel like I have to walk on eggshells. I then asked what it was that could be done that she could get over the situation and what steps she\u2019s taking to get over it. She told me that my response was the shittiest thing I\u2019ve ever said to her and told me to leave her alone. \n\nNormally I would be on her asking what I did wrong and pleading for forgiveness but I\u2019ve noticed every time I pretty much tell her that her issues aren\u2019t mine, she gets that way.\n\nHer personal issues shouldn\u2019t weight me down. Has anyone ever been in this situation? How was is resolved?",

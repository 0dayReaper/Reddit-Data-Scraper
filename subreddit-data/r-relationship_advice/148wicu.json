    "postText": "Ages are as of 2023. When we first met I was 17 and she was about to turn 19. When I was in high school there was this one girl who tbh stole my heart and I was in love with her for over two and a half years. She always told me she felt the same and later said that I was the only guy who ever gave her unconditional care. I ended up taking her to prom. I don\u2019t love her anymore, but I\u2019d be lying if I said I don\u2019t still think of her from time to time. Sometimes I\u2019ll see things or hear a song or somebody will says something that reminds me of her. I did some things I regret and so did she but I often think of all the things I did wrong and what may have happened if things between us worked out. We\u2019re both now in different relationships and haven\u2019t talked in over a year but I can\u2019t help but wonder if this is normal and if she still thinks of me.",

This is completely normal and I'm 100% sure she thinks of you from time to time. \n\nThis person was part of your life and in a special way, so thinking about them is bound to happen. Not to mention, we learn different lessons in life through a variety of people and therefore we will think of these people. \n\nDon't dwell on the past. Take it as a learning lesson and know what you can do better and different in the future.",

    "postText": "My boyfriend (m23) doesnt love me (f24)  like before. \nSo .. we have been having some problems in out relashionships recently. We have been fighting more. I feeled unloved and unwanted. I tried with being more loving it didn't work..i tried to be more distant it didn't change anything as well. \nYesterday we talked, i told him that i feel like he's not trying anymore, and he said it's like i was a dream car. You want that dream car and you are ready to do anything to get it. Then you finally get it and you are super happy and hyped about it. Then time passes and even though its the same car, you go to work with it every day and it's not the same. Ofc I got upset when he said that... I get what he means but at the same time, honestly hearing this hurts. I am afraid he's with me only because there's no other girl that likes him now... And maybe he would leave me when this happens.\nShould i be worried about his comment or that's normal? Should i break up with him when i feel unloved instead of hoping he would change?",

You are still young and you can find someone a lot better than him. You need to prioritise your happiness so just dump him and move on, he seems like an ungrateful asshole",

Like, in 10 years from now how will he be acting towards you? It is normal for that to happen in long term relationships but I feel like in your situation is too early for that to happen",

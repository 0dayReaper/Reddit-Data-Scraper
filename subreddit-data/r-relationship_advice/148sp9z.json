    "postText": "I used to have a couple of friends (one is 27 and the other is 31) who would always come around when I invited them to events and hang outs and what not but ever since they got into long term relationships I feel like I been placed in the back burner. (Both relationships they been with each other for over a year now) \n\nThese friends I feel like just always hang out with their partner or unless their partner can and I feel like I been left in the dust. I don\u2019t want to care or feel upset I just don\u2019t want to even think about it.\n\nI find myself thinking about it often and I hate feeling resentful. How do I get past this?",

You're totally right to feel angry and it's important to validate that I really hope you don't take away the opposite. Kickboxing class would be amazing! It would really get you in shape too! As someone who has hyper anxiety and ADHD, I find that exposure therapy works really well for me. The anxiety comes from not having any experience at the kickboxing class. But if you can find a way to make yourself go the first time, you then have some data for your brain to work with. You can then before you go you know what the entrance looks like, you know what the reception looks like, you know where the change rooms are, if you can get in the door and maybe just do it 10 minute tour that might help you get started! Good luck!",

I need some of that! Usually with ADHD meds they'll make you pair up anxiety meds as well and I've had great success with it so far. Wellbutrin and Concerta are what I take. The anxiety medication cranks down my anxiety and I don't think it affects anything else I still feel everything a lot I recommend it. My tummy hurt a little bit around the start but that's it for side effects. The ADHD meds activate the part of your prefrontal cortex that usually I don't want to say dormant but isn't activated because you're not stimulated enough. It's insane. Like I took it for the first time and it felt like I got pulled out of the sky and put on the ground. I never realized how much time I spent my own head until I got yoinked out of it!",

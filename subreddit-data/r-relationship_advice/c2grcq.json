    "postText": "https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c225le/update_wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids/\n\nI'm sorry to drag ya'll through the worst of my insecurities.  I definitely channeled quite a bit of my negative shit into what I posted.  But hey, that's what anonymous people are good for sometimes I guess.\n\nAnyways, we finally sat down after she got home last night.  I told her everything that was going on.  The Urologist, the money, the upcoming appointment.  I told her how, even with all her reassurances, too many suspect things kept happening.  \n\nShe agreed how everything looked, and immediately apologized.  She didn't realize how much my last exs cheating was still affecting me.  She knew I was off going into the weekend, but thought we addressed that. We talked about it Sunday, but I can get pretty internal with all these worries and not show them outwardly.  And so while she had thought we were communicating, I wasn't.  We decided to start from the beginning and go through everything together.\n\nThe money was the real problem for me. She agreed how inconsiderate it was with where my head was at to do that without mentioning it.  Apparently the prenatal visits are so structured that they want you to set up a payment plan with them right away, and she wanted to make sure it was squared away to keep the appointment.  She offered without me prompting to call them with me tomorrow to verify that, or if I really wanted we could move the money back.  She does get better rewards out of hers so it kind of made sense.\n\nWe read up on obstructive azoospermia, and it doesn't seem like they're often invincible forcefields.  It seems like only the actual absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) actually guarantees complete infertility, so it is possible for some to get through. We're going to go back to the original specialist I was working with last year and hopefully get a clearer picture.  It turns out the appointment she made was the only time they had available so soon, and figured it'd be best not to wait.  I told her I took off work to go with, and she was relieved I could join.\n\nOnce again, she said all the right things and seems genuine about getting us on the same page.  After going through each thing I was just wishing I believed her a little more before. She's stressed out with work and when she'll have to take off, but she really seemed to want to go out of her way to alleviate my concerns. She even offered an open phone policy if I needed.  We did look at the text I had seen, and it was just a girlfriend.  I declined though right now, since I don't want to be that husband.\n\nThis has really made me take a deeper look at what's in my past and how that still affects me today. Even thinking back to this weekend, it was so hard to see in the moment how much all the uncertainty was affecting me.  That level of anxiety literally makes you question what around you is real.  I think the trust but verify is the best way to put it. I was just trying to verify without any of the trust is all.  This has all put a strain on our marriage right now, but I'm feeling a bit more like we're a team again working towards easing that.\n\nShe thought that an NIPP ASAP was a great idea, as long as we also get some kind of counseling together.  I'm not big on therapy, but I can probably agree that it will most likely help.\n\nI'm feeling a little better about everything.  Thanks again to everyone who reached out and shared their own story (Every other comment here I read was a story of a family member who was supposed to be barren and ended up popping out triplets), and most of all those who helped me try to communicate fairly through all of this.   It's time for me to hopefully be a father.\n\n**TL;DR  Use your words. - Wife and I objectively went through everything.  We both apologized, getting a NIPP soon and hopefully a therapist.**\n\nUPDATE: The paternity test came back intially positive for anyone that's going to see this : )",

It's just that it's so unlikely that I will get pregnant (without surgery), that I am classed as infertile. It's very very very rare to be completely 100% infertile. You would have some very serious conditions to have that. Mine is actually pretty serious, leaving me in pain and having to have time off work. And I still take birth control. And use condoms. I can still get pregnant and it's not worth risking. I can't imagine the type of conditions you would have to have to stop producing sperm/eggs.\n\nRead up on your diagnoses people. Just spend that 15 minutes on the Wikipedia page looking into it. It seems terrifying (I didn't do it for ages!) But when you brave up you're like, oh right. \n\nAlso, if someone tells you they are infertile, understand that it means *extremely unlikely and difficult*, and still use protection if you don't want kids.\n\nAlso, don't just assume people that tell you they are infertile that they are lying if they still want to use birth control - lots of guys have questioned me on this.

It's a place where you can talk with someone who knows what they are doing and they can help you work through these problems. Depending what kind of therapy you do they can even provide you with practical tools you can use in the moment when you are feeling that anxiety to help alleviate it. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is probably the most common type of therapy for anxiety and it will absolutely give you tools to use in the moment. Consider a therapists that specializes in that! Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is also an excellent choice if it works with you, and I find the less structured method of it much more accommodating for most people.  \n\n\nAnother thing to consider, as I know it's big among a lot of the male population: going to therapy doesn't mean you are less of a \"man\" or masculine in any way. It's like getting a financial advisor, except they help with things like emotions/mental things rather than your money.   \n\n\nSource: Licensed MSW",

I did also get a hysterectomy at 30 because of issues with my reproductive system, but again, *2 kids*. \n\n\nFertility judgements and predictions aren\u2019t entirely accurate in most situations.  Unless you are straight missing some equipment (like there is no uterus at all for example) there\u2019s still a chance (albeit smaller than most).  \n\n\nWith women who are told we are infertile and get pregnant anyway, everybody just talks about how lucky we are.   But if we get pregnant with someone who was told they were infertile?  Well surely we are just sluttin around-only explanation!\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t just like, I need some reassurance level either.  It\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s spend OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS on a test (that could be postponed until after she delivered and a DNA test could be done at half the cost) because noting you say or do can convince me you didn\u2019t get dick from someone else.\u201d\n\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if his partner left him because of his trust issues TBH.  Then congrats, you have a baby you see less due to a custody agreement.\n\n\nLike imagine if she ever gets pregnant again what that would feel like?  The anxiety?  That\u2019s not gonna be a happy moment.  \n\n\nAs much as I sympathize with OP and everything, there\u2019s a point with anxiety where you have to stand back, check yourself, and really critically ask yourself if what you\u2019re doing is 1) reasonable 2) necessary 3) in your best interest.  Also 4) would this be better to broach with a counselor or outside professionals before I broach it with a loved one. \n\n\nIf even after she has been completely cooperative and open, and he\u2019s seen that his condition can still cause pregnancy-he wants to spend money on NIPP testing *and* go reevaluate his diagnosis with the doctor?  Yeah man.  I would be out.  Sorry.  I would like to think oh I would help my partner through their issues, but the fact is I would have my own difficulties to contend with (namely my pregnancy) and wouldn\u2019t be up to having my character insulted so deeply. \n\n\nFingers crossed they get through this and OP grows as a person, but he needs to do it fast.",

Like you said, really the only way it\u2019s certainly impossible for sperm to pass through is pretty much if there\u2019s no vas deferens at all. \n\nMy mother was told her tipped uterus would cause infertility. Here I am. My MIL had her *fcking tubes tied* and still got pregnant. And obviously the infinite stories there are about the vas deferens repairing itself after a vasectomy and causing pregnancy. \n\nHopefully you can now settle your anxiety a bit and further deal with how that past trauma affects you going forward.

Right after that she got pregnant again, a few months after that birth she got pregnant again. Did the eggs get in her bloodstream and somehow find their way to the right place? Did they come off the strip of tissue and just wander around her abdomen and end of in the right place? Bodies are weird.",

Getting to a point where you accuse your partner of getting pregnant by another person is wayyyyy beyond \u201cnormal trust issues\u201d and I can guarantee your wife will not soon forget this incredible display of publicized suspicion.",

Even when she agreed to paternity test and addressed all his concerns and jealousy, it is somehow still suspicious because she is saying all the right things. Then someone mentioned the money may be for a paternity test, they all jumped on some scheming evil soap opera of her getting her affair partner to do the test with her to fake the test result, because they can draw blood separately. How does that even work? Wouldn't the clinic technician notice they're drawing blood from three people for a test meant for two!? None of it made sense. \n\nShe also seemed to me like she was answer all of his questions and concerns in an understanding manner, but all sounds so muffled from his perspective. \"She knew about my insecurities and addressed it, what does that mean? She says she'll get a paternity test! What does that mean? She took money off the joint account! I haven't talked to her about it. What does that mean?\" Just communicate. The internet can't read minds.",

One day, it was just too much for her. She was exhausted. She wanted a relationship, not a daily quiz. \n\nGood luck OP, and congrats on the baby!!",

I don't think its inflammatory nature helps with the insecurities of your past. there's always a million scenarios that it could be and it's kinda traumatizing to see all of the horrible ones laid out in front of you. the important thing is to communicate with your spouse and strongly suggest you seek therapy together and alone if you truly want to get over your past.\n\nnow that your wife has done everything she can to alleviate your stress and concerns... maybe do something nice for her regarding the baby? like buy a cute onesie, blanket or stuffed animal. be EXCITED with her! you guys have been through an emotional roller-coaster and you gotta keep mama's stress level as low as possible now.\n\ngood luck, new dad! :)",

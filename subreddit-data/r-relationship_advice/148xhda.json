    "postText": "My partner (44F) and I (35M) have had a complicated relationship since we first got together 6+ years ago, including two breakups. \n\nWhen we got back together the first time, she stayed in touch with two guys who she had been involved with while we were apart. At the time it really bothered me, and I (clumsily and ineffectually) tried to communicate that, but was met with defensiveness and a lack of understanding. She wasn\u2019t being unfaithful or actively seeking them out, but she didn\u2019t stop them from making advances on her for a while, even though we were back together. This made me feel distrustful and shy away from the relationship. She eventually came around to hear my fears and tried to work on it with me, but the damage had been done, eventually leading me to leave last fall.\n\nWe both did a lot of work on ourselves and decided a couple of months ago to try one last time - hopefully with eyes wide open we could make the relationship we both wanted. Honestly, it\u2019s the healthiest I\u2019ve felt in a relationship, ever. We\u2019re both taking care of ourselves better, so we can show up in the relationship better.\n\nA week or so ago, she shared with me that she hooked up with one of the guys while we were apart - she knew that it was a trigger for me and wanted to be up front about it. She let me know that she called things off with him (because of the work she\u2019s been doing on herself) and that she hasn\u2019t been in touch with him for months. I reassured her that it happened while we were broken up and there was no indication that we\u2019d get back together. While that\u2019s true, there\u2019s a part of me that\u2019s hurt by the situation - which I\u2019ve shared with her. The problem is that I find my fear triggered seemingly out of nowhere.\n\nI trust my partner and I can see the progress she\u2019s made, so I feel embarrassed even having the fear in the first place. She\u2019s being extremely patient and understanding, and has heard my concerns, so that makes me more ashamed of the fact that I get triggered. I want to leave the past in the past, but I don\u2019t know how. We\u2019re working together, but I know there\u2019s more for me to do on my own.\n\nTl;dr: I\u2019m having a hard time letting the past be the past. How do I move forward?",

            "comment": "For me there was nothing I could really do to \"fast forward\" to forget the past. Basically you just gotta feel what you feel when you feel it. What did help me was keeping my brain occupied. Less time to focus on it. I'm usually a workaholic so that helped during the day. Then I focused on video games in the evening. Not saying this is the best idea, losing yourself in video games or anything. But you could always take on a new hobby or adventure for yourself to keep your mind off things a little more. Be patient with yourself because this is a process that takes time",

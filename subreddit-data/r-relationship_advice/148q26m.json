    "postText": "We've been seeing each other for 3 years. We've taken time apart in the past but this time was different because it was the first time my boyfriend had roommates. We didn't fight or split up in front of anyone, but my boyfriend did lean on one of his roommates, Adam, for support. \n\nAdam is an old friend of my boyfriend's. They've known each other since High School and started talking again about a year ago. They got the idea to move in together and ever since, my boyfriend has been mentioning that Adam is extremely judgmental and can get explosively angry due to the testosterone he takes. When we reconciled, my boyfriend expressed anxiety about Adam's reaction. \n\nAdam saw me today while my boyfriend was at work. He was very nice but my boyfriend immediately texted me to say that Adam was pissed and sending him nasty texts. He said Adam was being \"shockingly mean\" and he didn't want to talk about it any further so I told him I was sorry that happened. Is there anything else I should/can do? I feel strangely responsible",

Sure he may be his friend, and he's entitled to his feelings and opinions, but it was also your boyfriends choice to get back together with you. It's honestly none of his business. You have nothing to feel bad about.",

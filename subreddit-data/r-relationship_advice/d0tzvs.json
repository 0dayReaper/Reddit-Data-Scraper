I got a lot more responses than I had thought I would, so I apologize for not responding to so many of you. \n\nMy sister actually survived longer than the doctors anticipated, but she passed away on September 1st. It\u2019s been a very hard couple of days and I\u2019ve been grieving, as has my family. \n\nWe were able to use a lot of your ideas and play board games, take pictures, laugh and share stories. I was able to hold her hand and kiss her as she went. She was given pain medicine and went peacefully. \n\nI wanted to say thank you to one redditor who actually sent us board games to play. She normally felt pretty lethargic, but she did get to play and enjoyed it. We will continue to play these games as a family, and think fondly of when she played with us. \n\nMy family is now in the process of planning her funeral and laying her to rest. She will always be in our hearts and I know she\u2019s in a better place and not in pain. \n\nThank you again to everyone \u2764\ufe0f it will always mean so much to me and my family for all the thoughts, prayers and advice I was given.",

However the rest of the world keeps going on and it feels unfair and wrong that a life isn't honoured that means so much to you. There's tiny comfort in knowing that her beautiful young light has been recognised by so many. I'm glad her last days generated fond memories for you and so sorry she's gone.",

Oh, they mean well but honestly I think they are saying things to make them feel better in this hopeless situation. But saying simply that you are sorry is the best response.  I mean, what can you say?  This is the tragedy of all tragedies.  Irretrievable. In my grief group we even say, \"You never get over it but you can get used to it.\"  Even this far out I'm still grateful when someone says, \"I'm so sorry for your loss.\"  The list of things NOT to say is way too long to delineate. So I also add my admonishment, saying you are sorry is never meaningless.  In fact I'll go so far as to say it is perhaps the only meaningful thing to say.  And believe me, I've had every thing under the sun said to me.",

So many people will just forsake all others to keep their head firmly up their own ass. Your willingness to engage and expand your worldview is really wonderful! \n\nThe poem makes us cry because many of us have lost someone very special and close, and the idea that they\u2019re not truly GONE is comforting. My darling grandmother is still alive in the smell of honeysuckle on a hot summer day, and the poem embraces and builds upon that. \n\nUltimately, we cry because of empathy. We know someone to whom the poem applies and we fill in those blanks with our own experiences. For some, recalling that particular person evokes really intense feelings of love, loss, or even just acknowledgement of their existence can be enough to cause a crying reaction. \n\nI hope this helps you understand why we cry at a poem. It\u2019s the memory it evokes, and the comfort it brings that makes us tear up. Tears aren\u2019t always sad, you know. \n\nBest of luck in your endeavors to understand your fellow man a little bit better!",

            "comment": "I am so sorry for your loss. A while back I found this comment on grief by u/Gsnow and it really helped me a lot, I hope it can help you as well. \n\n&gt;Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.",

You want the physicist to talk to your grieving family about the conservation of energy, so they will understand that your energy has not died. You want the physicist to remind your sobbing mother about the first law of thermodynamics; that no energy is created in the universe and none is destroyed. You want your mother to know that all your energy, ever vibration, every BTU of heat, every wave of every particle that was her beloved child remains with her in this world. You want the physicist to tell your weeping father that amid the energies of the cosmos, you gave as good as you got.\n\nAnd at one point, you'd hope that the physicist would step down from the pulpit and walk to your brokenhearted spouse there in the pew and tell him that all the photons that ever bounced off your face, all the particles whose paths were interrupted by your smile, by the touch of your hair, hundreds of trillions of particles, have raced off you like children, their ways forever changed by you. And as your widow rocks in the arms of a loving family, may the physicist let her know that all the photons that bounced from you were gathered in the particle detectors that are her eyes, that those photons created within her constellations of electromagnetically charged neurons whose energy will go on forever.\n\nAnd the physicist will remind the congregation of how much of all our energy is given off as heat. There may be a few fanning themselves with their programs as he says it. And he will tell them that the warmth that flowed through you in life is still here, still part of all that we are, even as we who mourn continue in the heat of our own lives.\n\nAnd you'll want the physicist to explain to those who loved you that they need not have faith; indeed, they should not have faith. Let them know that they can measure, that scientists have measured precisely the conservation of energy and found it accurate, verifiable and consistent across space and time. You can hope your family will examine the evidence and satisfy themselves that the science is sound and that they'll be comforted to know your energy is still around. According to the law of the conservation of energy, not a bit of you is gone. You're just less orderly. Amen.\"",

While I still wish I could spend time with her, tell her things, and watch her grow up, I also know that she continues to be a part of my life. One of the biggest things I can recommend is to focus on her life, not her passing. My family will tell stories of things my sister did when she was younger, we continue to poke fun at the awkward phases she went through, we make the jokes she used to make for her. While it is appropriate to spend time focusing on her passing especially when mourning, it is equally important to remember that she is more than that. She was and always will be your sister.",

While there's no guarentee it helps in all cases, a lot of treatments for diseases like bone cancers (including leukemia) involve bone marrow transplants. Most healthy people are eligible to donate and may be a match for someone in need. I encourage everyone who can to look into joining a registry.

They might not be the same pains but one thing to remember is that to everyone who goes through pain, it seems like the end of the world.  \n\nSo never ever think you are going through life alone in how you feel. Never feel your problems are less or worse than another, and never ever ever judge others based on how silly their pain may seem.    It hurts them too.  They are breaking down inside too.  They feel it's the end of the world and wish they can just die.  They need your support too. \n\nIt's about time people in this world stop letting political opponents divide them from helping eachother.   \n\nHelp a neighbor out.   If you notice your neighbor is a complete asshole...he's like that for a reason.  If you see his trash can knocked over...pick it up before he gets home and sees it.    Do what you can to ease the pain others are going through.    You don't have to become their best friend but you have to do your duties to make the universe a meaningful place.    \n\nNone of that \"why should I if they won't\".  It doesn't matter.  Do it and expect or want no reward.   \n\nPeace.",

    "postText": "\nsome of y'all wanted the link to the original post, here it is\n https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/j1ur51/yesterday_i_froze_during_sex_and_my_girlfriend/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\nI thought I'd update y'all since so many people commented on my previous post. \n\nAs I said in earlier, I wrote her a letter and it was much more difficult than I thought it would be. But I wrote what was in my heart and how much I loved her and thanked her for supporting me. \n\nI made some of her favourite snacks and took her to a small park nearby. We ate and watched the sunset together and then I gave her the letter I wrote. She cried and hugged me and we sat there talking about future aspects. And then I showed the post to her. She welled up again and asked if she could come to a few therapy sessions with me so that she could understand better what I was going through. Also it might help her not burn out. I will talk to my therapist about it and we'll see how it turns out. \n\nBut that's about it. We went home, watched a movie and went to bed. I seriously feel so lucky to have her in my life\n\n Here's to hoping for our best future together. \n\nOh and, I seriously cannot thank you guys enough. Every single one of you who commented (even the rude ones) have made a difference. Seriously y'all are amazeballs. (I know many said to not say it ever again, but I like it so) \n\nThank you, from the bottom of my heart.",

You didn't seem to worry too much about the possibility she might leave you because of the honesty you expressed to her about your past.  It sounds like you have a very special girl by your side who is loving, patient and understanding.  You obviously mean an awful lot to her!  The fact that she's more than willing to go to therapy with you so she can better understand your past is priceless.  I'm older and have been married for 39yrs.  I haven't ever made any comments here but  after reading your post about this special girl in your life I felt so compelled to express my feelings to you!  I wish you so much happiness, love and peace in your life.  Of all of the advice I have for you I would tell you to practice immense patients!  Don't respond  hastily to your girlfriend.  Pause and take a couple of deep breaths before responding.  Think about your response.\n  Realize that you don't always need to reply with a statement instead just agree.  Women like it when you agree.  It makes them happy.  Relax, enjoy and just let things happen naturally.",

But hey, here's my heart-to-heart advice from one man to another.\n\nI was in a relationship for ten years, and we did everything together (we had no friends between us). Since our second anniversary, she wanted to get married; I wanted to be financially stable. She wanted three kids; I wanted one. She was an agnostic-mormon; I was changing from agnostic-Christian to atheist. She wanted me to live with her and her mom, and I didn't. All these small nonsensical things added up, and before I knew it, my individuality was erased; \"I\" became \"We.\"\n\nBy the end, she forced herself on me, and thought getting knocked up was the only way for her to guarantee a wedding. Her actions, along with my personal family problems, brought me to the lowest point of my life... I rather not think about that right now. Anyways, I broke up with her; I'm single, happy, and trying to rediscover myself. I'm also seeing both a psychiatrist, psychologist, and making new friends in a DnD group.\n\nMy advice: Your needs come before others. \"I\" should never be replaced with \"We.\"\n\nP.S. Congrats on receiving help and having someone who's very supportive. Don't let others think you're a lesser man for turning down sexual acts. Take care of yourself. Stay healthy. Good luck, and have fun. \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4d",

It affected my sex life for over 15 years.. it was really hard, and in some ways, still is - to be 100% comfortable with sex, but a wonderful therapist gave me the tools I needed to enjoy a fun and active sex life.  However, what is more important than personal 'tools' or strategy  is having a loving partner that you completely trust - it makes all the difference.\n\nI am crying as I write this - partially for my own loss, but all for your gain.

I\u2019m in a similar situation except reverse form you and also i have PTSD from a history of being a csec &amp; tortured, but my partner has a significantly higher level of flashbacks &amp; I hope you see this:\n\n- taking her to a couple therapy sessions (maybe have her come once every so often) to discuss safety planning for you (so make it about YOU, this is YOUR therapist) so she knows EXACTLY what to do, what your plans are to do in these kinds of situations, and what *not* do\u2014this helped me so much I can\u2019t even say. I felt so relieved to have a space where I could voice my concerns about my partner *to* my partner, with a safe 3rd party, and make a plan. This is going to make all the difference for your girlfriend\u2014and it\u2019s going to be so good for you too. Not enough people do this, and I can\u2019t recommend it enough. The only thing is, please do remind your girlfriend that it is *your* therapist &amp; thus their guidance &amp; support is going to be about you, so she needs to go in there knowing this is about safety planning for you, &amp;\nnot about her. These appts will still help massively with burnout and it\u2019s still ok for her to say hard things to you in this space (it\u2019s the best place really), but this less me to my next point:\n\n- *it is imperative that your girlfriend* also *gets her own individual therapist*. She needs a place where she can work out how she\u2019s feeling &amp; doing with everything on a continuing basis so she knows herself that it\u2019s ok to set boundaries, etc with you that may be extra difficult to do, &amp; most importantly, she needs this space so she doesn\u2019t burn out. Please, *please*, for the sake of your relationship &amp; for both of you, please advise her to get her own therapist.\n\nI spent the first 4 years of our relationship stopping my partner from killing themselves (a couple of times *literally*, I once restrained her while she was trying to slit her wrists), intently watching her during sex &amp; consistently asking \u201care you ok?\u201d during sex but knowing she couldn\u2019t always tell when a flashback started so I learned to recognize the signs in her eyes so I could shut sex down asap, driving her around at night when she couldn\u2019t sleep bc sometimes she could sleep in the car, holding her and listening as she discussed her trauma thousands of times often the same thing, &amp; accepting that she wouldn\u2019t remember 90% of our time together.\n\nI loved/love her with everything I am, and I was so stressed all the time that I wouldn\u2019t get it right. When I didn\u2019t notice fast enough that she was having a flashback during sex I felt like I failed. When she self-harmed I felt like I failed. When she that time tried to slit her wrists and I had to restrain her for so long that eventually I had to call her in her roommate to help me I felt like I failed bc I couldn\u2019t support her 100% of the time. When I got upset ((but nothing *to* her) bc she couldn\u2019t remember to do the things we agreed upon bc she\u2019d been triggered when we discussed it, I felt like I failed. I could go on. And during everything, I was also having flashbacks &amp; self-harming but I hid it from her bc the very few times I couldn\u2019t she would try to support me but then would have a terrible flashback after/during &amp; id end up needing to support her during hers when I just didn\u2019t have the energy or headspace. So I hid everything hard &amp; spent every moment I wasn\u2019t at work being her support system.\n\nAs you might guess, we were incredibly codependent. &amp; I couldn\u2019t be like they forever, as much as part of me wishes I could, I also burned out so hard for so long that I started wishing I was dead bc I couldn\u2019t do it anymore; I loved her so much &amp; nothing was gettjng better &amp; we were constantly in crisis.\n\nAs we both grew up in a constant state of crisis, this felt like it was normal &amp; so I felt like I was failing bc I was burning out.\n\nI\u2019m not telling you this to freak you out, but to emphasize how super important it is to:\n\n- have those safety planning sessions\n- your gf get an individual therapist\n- &amp; it\u2019s super helpful to get couples counseling so you have a 3rd Party who is there for your relationship and both of you, &amp; not either of you individually. It\u2019s a good place to work out what both of you need together.\n\nEveryone told me we couldn\u2019t work Bc our relationship was so unbalanced but they didn\u2019t get it. And we both worked our asses off to make it work and actively work on ourselves. And even with everything, we are together (12 years strong) and so happy &amp; now when I support her during flashbacks I am much better able to handle it, and our relationship continues to grow and flourish. I don\u2019t hide as much from her. So many other things have happened during the past 12 years, and what we fundamentally knew is that we love each other &amp; we wanted to work out whatever doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s so worth it, and I love her more now than ever.\n\nI tell you all this because reading your posts I so desperately want you two to be happy, &amp; to not make the mistakes we did. She doesn\u2019t need to get to burn out. You deserve to have her support, and you both deserve to be able to make healthy boundaries with each other.\n\nI\u2019m so happy you found someone who loves you so beautifully. Please remember that you *deserve* this king of love. You deserve support from your partner. You deserve and have the fundamental right to stop having sex or not have it at all if you don\u2019t want to/ it feels scary/your having a flashback/you get stuck/etc. you\u2019d deserve body autonomy. You deserve to have healthy communication with a partner who listens and respects you.\n\nThe fact you two are communicating so openly is wonderful and going to make a huge positive difference. And the fact that you want her to know how much you love her and are grateful for support is going to have such a good impact on her and your relationship. She needs to know she\u2019s doing right by you and you telling her in these ways shows how wonderful of a partner you are. Remember too that a partner having respect for you and stopping sex because you need that is absolutely something you deserve and even as you thank her and let her know how appreciative you are, remember that this is how it should be, &amp; even as it is an extraordinary circumstance in your life, it shouldn\u2019t be.\n\nIt might sound like I\u2019m minimizing how good your girlfriend treats you, but it\u2019s really important that you don\u2019t become so grateful for her healthy treatment of you that you a) start to idolize her and b) believe that this is extraordinary treatment when everyone *should* treat you like this. And that\u2019s important because if b) happens it minimizes your own body autonomy and gives to much power to what should be a healthy dynamic on its own.\n\nAnd be careful of a). My partner started to idolize me in a way that was deeply unhealthy for both of us. She was so grateful that I was the first safe person to be in her life in this role &amp; that she could trust me with everything she was for the first time in her life. It\u2019s wonderful that she felt (feelS) safe with me and trusts me, but by idolizing me it both led to her feeling like she didn\u2019t deserve me because I\u2019m too perfect (her words, trust me, I\u2019m soooo not) and to her treating me somewhat terribly sometimes bc she felt safe enough to take out her negative feelings with other people and with her abuse on me bc she knew I wouldn\u2019t hurt her. This is obvs subconscious but it\u2019s a super common thing to happen.\n\nAlso? This doesn\u2019t allow for a more equitable dynamic. And her idolizing me led to her having a hard time accepting that my healthy treatment of her was something she *deserved* and not something that I \u201cgifted\u201d her with.\n\nSo please, what you did with the picnic is wonderful and keep it up (honestly, I super wish my partner had done things like this for me, it would have made it much easier for me and made me feel like I wasn\u2019t fucking up all the time m), *and* remember that you deserve this.\n\nSorry this is so long, I\u2019m just really rooting for you guys and I see a lot of us in you guys, although from your ability to communicate so healthily and your girlfriend already recognizing that she needs to be careful of burnout, you two are in a much healthier place than we were and I\u2019m so happy for you.\n\nYou got this.",

I honestly love it because he makes it clear every time that he's into me because of *me*. \n\nBut if I'm ever not in a place? That's fine. He backs off. I've had to stop in the middle of sex entirely and he just. Stops. He says, \"ok\" in the most cheerful voice and we just lay there together talking. \n\nI haven't been raped... But my ex was very pushy about sex and would get very sulky if I just wasn't up for it or if I need to stop in the middle (sometimes it was just to pee and he got upset). By the end of our relationship, I was turning to a kink in a really destructive way (that I'm only now able to really deal with in a healthy way again) just to get turned on enough for sex. I wanted to, but the stress of work and all the pressure from my ex of kept shutting me down. \n\nI'm so incredibly happy for you!! I hope you guys are happy for a long time together.

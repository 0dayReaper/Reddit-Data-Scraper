    "postText": "So we met online a few months back and have been together since. Things started off very quickly and we were saying \"I love you\" within 2 months of meeting. A few weeks ago we went on a little vacation together and she opened up to me about how she was molested by someone she still lives with today. Acts like that have always made me super emotional whether it's anger or sadness and I am a naturally protective person. So you can probably imagine how shocked and upset I was when I learned this. I want to be able to help her and keep her safe but I feel helpless as we both live with our parents and are financially unable to do our own thing together or separate. I love her so much and want to be able to do what I can to help her but I don't know how to do this other than be a shoulder she can cry on. Is there anything I can do in this situation?",

Be careful because you also have to protect yourselves, but also be supportive of our situation as this is very tough and may be embarrassing and scary for her as well. Let her know that you don\u2019t judge her, but keep encouraging her to speak to one of the her Teachers at your school or a adult friend that you guys know. She needs help and she may not know how to get it.",

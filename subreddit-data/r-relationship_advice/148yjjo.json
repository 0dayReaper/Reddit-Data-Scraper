    "postText": "\n\n\n\nI am just going to call him Joe to preserve his identity. I'm 19 currently. When I was 18 and fresh out of highschool, I got with Joe. Joe was taking college in a different city, about an hour and a half away. I was so in love with him, he promised me everything. 3 months into the relationship, I got with Joe to explain I couldn't do long distance. He begged and cried to stay with me, convincing me to move with him. I agreed. I moved into his grandmother's house and later got an apartment with him. 3 months into living in that apartment, Joe said I had 2 months to pack my things and leave, as he was going to go back home to the original city. If I didn't comply, I'd be stuck at the apartment with the rent and away from my family. A day later he switched it to 2 weeks. And today just told me he fell out of love. I am devastated.\n\nHow do I cope? I have to pack up everything and move. It's like my life got turned upside-down.",

That\u2019s not how it works.\n\nHowever\u2026 there is a possibility he can skip out and stick you with the rent, which will tank your credit if you don\u2019t pay. Unless you can talk to the landlord and get him to take the guy off the lease so it won\u2019t affect your credit if he doesn\u2019t pay? \n\nTalk to your parents. You need help with this.",

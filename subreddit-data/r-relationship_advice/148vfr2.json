    "postText": "Hi all. Throw away because this is something I'm lowkey embarrassed about saying. I feel really guilty for having the feelings that I do. (NSFW because it has to do with sex).\r  \n\r  \nSo, I guess some backstory to start off. I haven't been single for more than 6 months, and when I am single I've had a tendency to \"go wild,\" as one may put it. I've had 3 now total long-term girlfriends, however, I identify as bisexual.\r  \n\r  \nThe first one was in high school and she was my first, everything. I consider her today to be someone that I would've loved to spend the rest of my life with. I've noticed this thing with my relationships, either we mesh on a personal level, or on a sexual. With her, it was on a personal level. However, close to the end of our relationship, she became really manipulative and emotionally abusive, ending that personal level connection. I moved away to study abroad, and we drifted apart. She passed away a few years ago.\r  \n\r  \nThe second was my most traumatic, only ending about a year ago (and 2 weeks before I started dating my current girlfriend). We dated for 3 years, and it was awful. She ended up becoming physically and emotionally abusive. Needless to say, we did not vibe on a personal level, but did very much on a sexual level.\r  \n\r  \nI left my ex for my current girlfriend, which outside of the abuse makes me sound like an asshole but eh. So, essentially, my current girlfriend is the love of my life. She treats me so well, and she is truly amazing. I know I'm young, but this gal is different. In my previous relationships, I always had a thought in the back of my mind saying that we wouldn't last more than a few years. Idk, I feel bad about it, but I would always chalk it up to that voice in my head that won't go away, like the voice that tells you to jump at a ledge. But, until now, I didn't think that way with her. We are madly in love, and I am a little embarrassed to say that I tear up a bit thinking about our future together. There just is one thing, however, that is making me really nervous.\r  \n\r  \nI have a high libido. I guess one could say that it is a normal 21-year-old man's libido, but it's a high libido nonetheless. Sex and sexual interaction have always been important to me in previous relationships. I am really sex-positive and have enjoyed in the past exploring aspects of the sexual world with partners (sorry if that makes me sound like a creep, I promise I'm not lol). My girlfriend, however, does not share this trait.\r  \n\r  \nIn our almost year-long relationship, we've had sex maybe 2 times, and none for more than a few minutes, and I honestly am so in love with her that I didn't care. We don't interact on a sexual level more than 1 or 2 times a month, including making out. My nonchalant attitude towards it changed recently when I asked her \"do you think we'd have sex on our wedding night?\" and she said \"Idk, prolly not,\" and then began to apologize profusely. I've never brought up the fact that the low libido bothered me before, because it truly didn't! But whenever she wasn't in the mood for something, she would apologize a lot, and sometimes even get upset at the (crazy) prospect that I would leave her over it.\r  \n\r  \nEver since she said that, I've been really nervous. Like, sick to my stomach nervous. I love her so much, and I can't imagine not spending my life with her, but on the other hand, I want to know and love her in this physical way. I feel like I can't talk to her about this, because I don't want her to freak out about me leaving her. She has really bad anxiety :/. But, I also don't know what to do. I don't want to be 21 and in a sexless relationship!\r  \n\r  \nSo, I came to reddit, to discuss my very private and intimate problem. I feel like such an asshole for having these thoughts, but I just really need advice. Am I being sane, or am I just freaking out for no reason?\n\nTL;DR I love my girlfriend, so fucking much, but our labidos don't match. Pls advise.",

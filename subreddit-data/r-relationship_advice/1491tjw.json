    "postText": "I\uff0826F) met a guy, A (27M), in junior high school, and have always been good friends, occasionally having dinner together and usually interacting on social media all the time.\n\n  \nAt university, he through me at a friend's party and met my primary school friend, boy B(27M\uff09,  and soon after I found out that they were going out alone with other friends without inviting me, but I didn't care at the time.\n\n  \nLater, Boy A went to Australia, Boy B went to America and I went to France. We didn't see each other for about three years, but we were always in touch on social networks.\n\n  \nIn the last two years, B and I have gone back to work in our home country. Last week, I found out that A had also returned to our hometown. I briefly greeted him and invited him to have dinner sometime, and he responded enthusiastically.\n\n  \nHowever, I found out yesterday that A had returned to our hometown for a wedding, and B was still his best man, but A had not invited me to his wedding. I feel like I've been betrayed by two friends who don't see me as a friend, and it's a hurtful feeling.\n\n  \nBut the wedding was the most important moment in A's life and I still liked the post with his wedding photos. Should I stop thinking of them both as my friends? I need some advice, thank you guys!",

Some friendships can just be surface level and that shouldn\u2019t detract on what you decide to do. Let\u2019s be honest; if you think you\u2019ve interacted enough and have been friends enough to have invite and didn\u2019t get one then that\u2019s just a potential sign of where you sit. You have two choices - 1. Continue to be a \u2018friend\u2019 and pass on well wishes to the wedding. They may even respond in kind and explain why you did t get an invite. 2. Say fuck em. Carry on about your life and focus on passions and rewards you do have assurances over. People are people. Focus on your own well-being and I can assure you, once you have your own positive aura, a natural attraction to have you around will be seen amongst others. All the best!",

I would suggest going to dinner and congratulating him and talking to him generally about his wedding and hopefully it naturally comes up. If not, maybe say you were surprised to find out through Facebook (I\u2019m assuming) in a calm casual manner and see if he tells you then. That way you may get an answer. \n\nThen you can adjust your friendship based on that answer. It\u2019s hard to feel like you put more time and effort into a friendship/relationship and sometimes the best thing to do is pull back slightly and give them the opportunity to meet you halfway. If they don\u2019t then you know not to waste time giving more effort than they\u2019re willing to give. \n\nI am a firm believer in only giving the same effort as you\u2019re given. I\u2019m not spending time and money on an amazing birthday gift if I\u2019m only going to get a \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d text in return. \n\nI hope it all works out for you!",

    "postText": "[Original](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gpa82s/my_36m_wife_34f_keeps_tying_my_boots_after_ive/)  \n\nI've gotten a few requests for update but didn't want to post until I felt like I really had anything to say. A lot has happened in the past two weeks so I'm going to try to go over it as best I can.\n\nMy wife and I started talking again. We had a very serious conversation and I did apologize for what I did to her running shoes, and then I told her I had to speak some truth and I wanted her to promise me that she wasn't going to roll her eyes, interrupt me, scoff, or get sarcastic with me, which she did. I told her that I was not kidding about my boots, that while most of the time I caught geriatric transports, falls, and nausea, there were instances where response time was of the essence and I didn't have time to play around with my boots in the middle of the night. I told her that there have been times when my intervention has been critical in saving a life, when my training has helped me recognize an underlying emergency, or when a call I made ensured that a patient was prioritized upon arrival at the hospital. I explained that a lot of the shit I see, I don't tell her about because I don't want to give her nightmares or make her worry about me. She actually listened and didn't dismiss what I had to say. She responded that she was trying to help by keeping things neat.\n\nI responded, \"But you're not. Sweetie, I'm not trying to be mean, but you're not helping. You're hindering me. One day it may be the difference between life and death. I need you to not touch my gear. It's where I know where it is, it's where I can easily find it in a short amount of time, and if you move it, you are impeding an emergency response. I don't care if it looks neat. It serves a function, it doesn't look pretty. If you want to help me, please leave my gear where I put it.\"\n\nA few nights later I had my friend Officer Rich come over. Officer Rich was one of the two cops that did CPR on the victim that night. The three of us sat on our deck and had a few social distancing beers. He talked about getting there, doing CPR, giving Narcan, waiting for the ambulance and getting her back shortly before we got there.\n\nHe then pulled out a few photos of car accidents that I had worked. He showed them to my wife and pointed out, \"This car went into a tree. Your husband crawled into the wreck, put a collar on the driver, and stayed in there giving him oxygen until we could get him out.\" \"Your husband pulled a three year old out of this wreck.\" \"Your husband recognized that the driver had a stroke and took her to a stroke center, which likely saved her life.\"\n\nAfter that, I told her I had something I wanted to show her and I asked her for the same promise I'd asked earlier. When she agreed, I showed her a video on YouTube of a police bodycam from an overdose. This video showed how critical time is in getting someone back, and the training someone goes through in order to give the drug, do CPR, and utilize an AED.\n\nI told her, \"I'm not trying to attack you, I don't want to have a fight, but I want you to understand what I go through. That I hope every call I go on is transporting a boo boo, because otherwise it means that if I don't do everything right someone could die. If I don't get out that door as quickly as possible, someone could suffer brain damage while they're waiting for me to give them oxygen. If I'm upset and shaking because I had to waste time opening my boots, I might miss something critical and someone might not make it.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that she understood and told me she hadn't really thought about the danger of what I do until the other night when she saw the photos of the wrecks. I told her that I think she has OCD and needs to see a therapist because it's hurting our marriage. I listed examples of her throwing important things out, moving things without permission, and messing with my gear. I offered to go together and said I'd be willing to work on things together.\n\nAfter I pointed out the pattern, she agreed that it was time to speak to someone. She wants to think about whether she wants to go together or go by herself, but she has promised me that she's going to try to change her patterns. I brought up her saying she thought I was going to hit her, and she acknowledged she'd been with guys who flew off the handle with little provocation and scared her. That she'd never seen me get that angry and it triggered her because she didn't think I was capable of blowing up like that.\n\nShe's been very emotional lately and has been going through mood swings. She's been worried about me going out on calls. The other day she started crying and said, \"I hope you know how much I appreciate what you do.\" Knock on wood, since we had the big talk, she hasn't touched my boots.\n\nIs everything resolved? Not by a longshot. But she seems to have a new appreciation for what I do. Thank you for all of your responses. I wound up not showing her the thread, because a lot of it was pretty harsh towards her. I recognize I cherry picked incidents that didn't put her in the best light, and there's a lot more to her and our marriage than that. She is the person I chose for the rest of my life, and I want us to work.\n\ntl;dr Let my wife into my world a little more, she let me into hers, and she hasn't touched my boots since.",

It's an amazing job that I wouldn't trade for the world! \n\nThough the pay isn't the best. In Co I was working for a private ambulance company making 11.17 which is just above minimum wage. We would get extra transport bonuses infrequently. I think I was on pace to make about 25k per year. Living in Denver which has a high cost of living. I'm currently making about 50k a year in Wa, so more comfortable. I do wish pay was better but I don't see it changing anytime soon. \n\nBut more most EMTs it is not a career, it is a stepping stone into many different careers. Mainly Fire, Medic, PA, nursing, med school. All of which pay significantly better than EMTs. And depending on where you live you might be able to perform IVs and give meds.  The experience you get as an EMT is valuable for continuing in the medical field.",

                    "comment": "It's got to be OCD. I say that as someone else who has it. When I was a kid I would cry and throw tantrums if my socks weren't lined up with my feet properly.\n\nOP, for what it's worth, I had no idea I had OCD and that I wasn't 'normal' until I was sitting in a psych class one day watching a documentary on OCD. It took people describing their symptoms for me to have an epiphany and take a sweeping look around the dark classroom, only to crushingly realize nobody else had the same epiphany. That was when I knew something was wrong. \n\nSo my point is that your wife has probably had it for a very long time and never knew. She likely thought it was something everyone else dealt with too. That's probably part of where the mood swings come from. It kind of both sucks and is liberating to find out you're not neurotypical. On the one-hand it sucks to know you're different and dealing with something others may never understand. On the other it's a relief to know that there is something you can pinpoint in terms of what is making you feel like an anxious wreck.\n\nI want to be very clear that her treatment is not going to be an overnight thing. I know she said she would work on it, and I'm sure she will try, but trust me when I say it's probably a herculean task for her to not tie your shoes. I realize how stupid that sounds. Everyone who has OCD deep down knows how stupid what they are doing is, but we cannot help it. That switch of confirmation when something gets done never gets flipped. For us, that sense of uncertainty and doom if we don't do something the right way or perform a ritual is always lingering. The only thing that helps with that is therapy and time. So you'll need to give her time. OCD never really goes away, we just learn better coping mechanisms to talk ourselves down from needing to perform our rituals. \n\nTBH I think you should straight up ask her why she felt the need to tie your boots every night. You've explained it as her being a neat freak, but that's not how OCD works at its core. We do our rituals and compulsions because our obsessions make us feel like if we don't, the world may very well end. We know how stupid it sounds, but again, brain switches aren't wired right. So maybe try asking her, again, why it was she felt the need to tie your boots. And be sincere, and tell her you won't judge her if it turns out to be a really strange sounding reason. From my OCD head, I'd probably do something like that because of my fear of you getting up at night, tripping over the laces, falling and cracking your head open and dying before you could get to the hospital. Does that sound ridiculously dire? Welcome to OCD. But I have learned that sometimes certain things can help. Like when I lived with roommates, I would have THEM check things before bed and reassure me stuff was off, etc. because in my head if anything wasn't off it was 'their' fault rather than mine. Some other folks have described success with taking pictures so they can reassure themselves without checking the actual item, etc. So ask her, and you can maybe figure something out that will bring you peace and bring her relief. Maybe something like you turning your boots to face the wall and tucking the laces inside them, and reassuring her that the laces are put away. IDK, just spitballing here.\n\nYou don't need to fully understand OCD to sympathize and help your wife cope with it. Those of us with OCD don't fully understand it either because it feels like a curse nobody else takes seriously. And because of that we go through a constant cycle of anxiety, trying to fix that anxiety with compulsions, then ridiculing ourselves for doing these rituals that we know are stupid as hell. And the cycle begins anew, viciously, and without reprieve. \n\nSorry to write a textbook but without even reading your update and only reading the original post, I knew right away that she had OCD. Anyone who has had an OCD meltdown can recognize the signs of it from a mile away. It's just one of those illnesses that people on the outside don't really recognize because they think it's all book organization and hand washing, but on the inside, those of us with it are trapped in our own endless feedback loops of anxiety, trying to fix that anxiety and failing, and defeat.\n\nBut there is hope in therapy, and I hope she responds well to it. You can do your part by coping with what she's going through. Surely there are some issues unique to you that she has helped you cope with. The reflief she's going to feel when she finally starts to break those OCD chains that keep her doing these things is probably going to be palpable for both of you, so please just do not ridicule her if she comes to you with stuff that sounds completely out of this world, and celebrate with her when she finally starts working through her therapy.\n\n**edit: JFC I'm reading thru some of the other comments in this thread and some of you people are monsters. Anyone with 2 brain cells to rub together could read between the lines of OP's post to understand his wife has a mental illness that needs treatment. I hope those of you commenting are like 14 years old or something with no actual real world experience, because most of you just look like clueless idiots that probably believe your TV shows when they tell you depression is only ever about becoming a slob and anxiety is caused by a lack of social life. Also glad to know a bunch of you would throw a marriage away over a SINGLE POST you read from the HUSBAND'S SIDE which he admitted he probably portrayed her in a skewed light in. God I seriously hope ya'll are like teenagers and not just stupid, obtuse adults. If so, look at your life and why you probably have no friends, family, or close relationships and understand that you yourself are probably the problem with your narrow, gullible, uneducated world view and lack of experience.**\n\n**edit x 2: Sooo I realized after posting this comment and flying off the handle in frustration that I probably made myself a huge target for people to respond/troll back at, so I disabled inbox notifications for this comment a while ago. But on the off chance anyone is reading this and wants to know more about OCD and what it can be like, here's a good overview by the ADAA:\n\nhttps://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd/touching-movement-rituals#:~:text=People%20with%20OCD%20often%20perform,or%20pressure%20throughout%20the%20body.\n\nAnd if, by chance, you read through my comment and the link above and are coming to the same epiphany I did, those many years ago in that psych class, that the distressing thoughts and compulsions you have are not normal, do some research and reach out to someone who will understand and help. A doctor, a therapist, anyone. I know it can be crushing to realize you may have OCD or some other issue, but remember that your life that seems normal with those feelings can be even better if you work on getting rid of them. Food for thought, anyway. \n\nAnyway ya'll have a peaceful Friday night, and good luck to you and your wife, OP.",

                            "comment": "To add a bit for OP (u/throwRAshoes hoping you see this), since my girlfriend has OCD: the therapy will be hard, really really hard assuming she's going to get exposure and response prevention. She's going to be asked to do exactly the things that trigger huge panic attacks for her (though they'll most likely build up to it) and she *must* resist acting upon it. Everything in her head will scream that she must do X or else.... Rinse and repeat, dozens of times, until the brain is rewired to prefer the normal path over the OCD path. And mind you, she will most likely always have the OCD screaming at her, but hopefully from a huge distance, which should make it easier to do the right thing. She will most likely also have one or more relapses after therapy. It happens a lot. But, if things have gone well, she will be able to recover from them quicker with all the tools and strength she's been given.\n\nAs a partner, your biggest challenges will be supporting her in her accomplishments, even though they may seem like nothing and are not going fast enough in your opinion. Also, you will be given *one* important task: do *not* facilitate her OCD. This is your hardest task, because it means you will have lots of conflicts with her as you will most likely be doing lots things that trigger her OCD, which you otherwise would have avoided or would have done her way. Please also take note of any avoidence. People with OCD are king at avoiding things that may trigger attacks and the patterns will eventually show once you know how to look for them. This is important for her therapy, as she may not admit herself to avoiding those things and may have a 'perfectly logical explanation' for doing it that way.\n\nI've been through absolute hell with my girlfriend, because we weren't getting the help we needed. It has completely destroyed our relationship and I'm pretty sure we have some form of PTSD now because of all the fighting, screaming, enormous amounts of stress and lack of sleep. Please take care of yourself and remember that you are in your right to end the relationship if you are no longer able to handle things. I never had the guts because I cared to much and I wanted to stick with her until she got her therapy. She's had that now, the OCD has decreased by a lot, and we'll be going through couples therapy to see of there's anything left of what was once there.\n\nEdit: one more thing I wanted to add. If they want her on anti-depressants, just be aware that it won't actually fix the OCD. It's meant to decrease the anxiety, but the OCD will still be there. Also, you might be interested in researching the use of microdoses of psilocybin (magic mushrooms). They're doing some research with this now and it's showing promising results.  Of course, discuss with a doctor/therapist first, though they might not be open to it.",

Some of those phrases you used to describe your experience with OCD are exact things my partner has described to me about his anxiety.\n\n&gt; But I have learned that sometimes certain things can help. Like when I lived with roommates, I would have THEM check things before bed and reassure me stuff was off, etc. because in my head if anything wasn't off it was 'their' fault rather than mine.\n\nThis is what works for my partner, too! At first it was frustrating and seemed silly to do, but I realized that any inconvenience to me was so worth helping him through his feedback loop and causing unnecessary stress and anxiety. After talking and some time, he\u2019s comfortable telling me if something is triggering him, and I try to be aware and take care of it without drawing attention to it.\n\nThanks a ton for sharing your experience so bluntly. It gave me some more insight into understanding my SO.\n\nBest of luck!",

I also study Experimental Psychology with a focus in disorders. It can be challenging for anyone involved, I\u2019ve gotten so upset and anxious to where I shut down everything went out of my head to where I only remembered the basics. It can even be a physical response to where it\u2019s painful, skin crawling sensation or even feverish. It\u2019s challenging especially with triggers can be so seemingly minor compared to what may come out to as to everyone else. There are also several types of OCD, the common one is neatness/cleanliness obsession, there\u2019s fear of illness or disease obsession which can evolve into hypochondria depending on the situation and the individual; relationship and love obsession, which can appear as jealousy or possessiveness. However, the most misunderstood one is harm obsession as it manifests in multiple different ways. This is where Freudian beliefs are no longer applicable, as harm obsession can be intrusive thoughts of harming oneself, loved ones, strangers, pets but it causes horrible stress and pain. OCD when it\u2019s not properly diagnosed or treated with therapy with an experienced therapist can be even more detrimental. I love how this thread is heavily focused on the mental health and well being for both persons involved. I really hope OP goes to a therapist for himself as well as his wife, especially for a diagnosis and to get started with a treatment plan. Then couples counseling as well. We are all struggling with stress, loss, grief, and struggling. If anyone has any psychology questions, OCD questions, Anxiety questions please feel free to PM me. Im more than happy to help and point towards places to get help. I\u2019m as of yet not licensed so I cannot give a session or diagnose, I can only suggest help or some tips that I use for my OCD and Anxiety. I\u2019m finishing up school and going towards my Masters.",

I have it (undiagnosed I think, but it's gotten better on drugs to treat OCD, as well as CBT), and it stuck out like a sore thumb.\n\nPeople really need to take the time to try to understand OCD. It's not always the same, some people can function better than others, and it's important to understand why compulsions (and obsessions) happen. People with OCD will have a much harder time getting help if everyone still believes OCD is *only* handwashing or germaphobia.",

They often feel that what they are doing is the \"right\" way of doing things. An example would be a college student doing 8 hour notes by hand and demanding a group do a project his/her way because its the \"right\" way even if he/she is failing their classes.\n\nOCD (Obsessive compulsive disorder) is egoDYStonic. That is compulsions cause distress. These people acknowledge their compulsions but they are not happy about them. An example would be a person checking a lock 8 times before going to bed or washing their baby 5 times to prevent infections.\n\nWorth the distinction!",

Being vulnerable, even with a spouse, is really hard, but it is also \"[the birthplace of joy, of creativity, of belonging...](https://youtu.be/iCvmsMzlF7o)\" There is nothing more important to building relationships. I think your decision to be authentic with your wife about the daily struggles at your job has encouraged strength in your relationship, and possibly saved your marriage.\n\nIf your wife decides to attend therapy, it is probably best that she have an individual councilor separate from a couples councilor. A couple's councilor sees the couple as the client, and an individual councilor sees the individual as the client (even if other loved ones are in the room.) It might not hurt for you to consider an individual therapist as well, as a support system to help you adapt as your wife changes/grows through her own therapy experiences. No matter what combo of professionals you go with, as you pursue therapeutic options, search for a professional that also understands the value of vulnerability.\n\nIt may not be OCD - your wife may just be very neurotic. OCD's most common presentation is \"unwanted obsessive thoughts\" which make the client unable to function normally. Don't get hung up on labelling her behaviors specifically as OCD, be open to other answers. Look for professionals who will encourage letting go of damaging behaviors without vilifying them (which can just reinforce them instead). If it is OCD by psychiatric diagnosis, (and having personally known several people with OCD), watch out for doctors that want to just medicate behaviors away.\n\nKeep checking in with each other, and keep being wholehearted.

Around 2 am or so, dad's pager started going off. It was a barn  fire and they were calling 3 departments immeadiatly and had 3 or 4 more on stand by.\n\nI stood in the doorway to my bedroom and watched my father run across the their room in his underwear, he grabbed a tee shirt and a second later he was wearing it. My mother had rushed to the other side of the room.\n\nShe says; 'Tom' and dad looks. My mother throws a pair of jeans clear across the room and she hits my dad in the face with them. He catches them and flips them around and puts them on. Then he's running down the stairs while putting socks on.\n\nProbably 1 minute later you could hear the door to the house and then to his car. His car turns over and I sware his driveway is long enough that he'd be doing close to 60 mph by the end of it.\n\nWith that he'd be off into the night.",

So I apologize for thinking that it was a personality issue.

If you consider the dread and anxiety that comes from things being \"wrong\" (think her meltdown after not being able to go for her run/her shoes being \"wrong\") you can get an understanding as to why she was choosing to be in denial. \n\n\n\nAcknowledging the importance of his duties = not being able to indulge her compulsions. That's exactly why this is a solid indicator of legitimate OCD-  If you're at the point where you're effecting your quality of life/safety to do something, you should highly consider the possibility of a mental illness. especially since from what we've read here they seem to have a very wonderful, functional relationship up until she engages in these very specific obsessive behaviors.\n\n\nI think if she goes and they find out she doesnt have OCD, then he definitely needs to reconsider the partnership bc that changes the root cause entirely, from a control/anxiety issue to an issue of willfull ignorance. No need to slander her unless that's the case imo.",

As a fellow EMT of 10+ years, I\u2019m glad you made some significant progress on this issue. \n\nI read your story shortly after you first posted and have been hoping for an update. I can really relate to a lot of what you mentioned, including the \u201cboo-boo bus\u201d stuff and your importance being minimized. I\u2019ve worked rural and urban, volunteer and paid, and I can tell you that people often don\u2019t appreciate us until they or a family member need us. \n\nI\u2019m very glad that your wife is obviously making a real effort to understand you and to resist her compulsion in this particular regard. I really hope that she gets the help that she needs and that you continue to have a healthy, happy marriage.",

How have you been married for any length of time without your wife knowing this much about you? Does she know your last name or is that not discussed till the 10th year of marriage? Fuuuuck this has got to be made up as an ego-trip for some emergency responder. If not, this whole situation is unimaginably shitty and I hope this \"marriage\" ends soon and saves everyone grief.

My girlfriend (we've been together 8 years), would react in exactly the same way as your wife when there was any issue related to our communication or her behaviour. OCD wasn't a factor, but there were many other similar traits around control, and after discussing them she'd become so upset and turn it into my fault. I spent weeks carrying around guilt for questioning her behaviour or getting angry about something that we'd talked about over and over again.\n\nLong story short, we reached breaking point, she started counselling and made all sorts of links with her behaviour, the dynamic of our living situation and her past experiences. It's a long journey, but it's the best journey I've ever been on. She's put in so much work on herself and we have never been closer.\n\nI read your post, welled up and ran to tell my gf how proud I am of her.\n\nI wish your wife and you the best of luck.",

And you mentioned that you\u2019ve hid them, etc. this was all just too much, it shouldn\u2019t have gotten to the point of you screaming at her because she shouldn\u2019t have pushed you there. Your wife is a psycho who likes to push buttons and then play victim and I\u2019m sorry you deal with that.

I can see you love her very much to fight this hard for the relationship. That's why I'd like to have a temporal reference, to know if you know her for a long time and knew that it was worth it, or if you are just very firm on your decisions.",

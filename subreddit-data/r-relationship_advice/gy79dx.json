    "postText": "I have been with my boyfriend for over a year and everything has been great except for one thing. \nEvery single day, at least once, he will tell me that I stink and smell of b.o. \n\nWhen we met I showered every day, applied regular deodorant in the morning, brushed my teeth three times a day. Now I am so paranoid about smelling bad that I shower at least twice a day, I apply new industrial strength deodorant every few hours (I have a reminder on my phone), perfume,  and I brush my teeth anytime I eat or drink something that isn\u2019t water. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m going crazy. I didn\u2019t think I smelled bad in the beginning and I don\u2019t think I smell bad now but I obviously smell bad to him right? Im that weirdo that keeps \u201csneakily\u201d smelling their own armpits. I have been to the doctor and he has said there is nothing medically wrong. It has honestly gotten to the point where I literally shove my arm pit in friends and families faces asking if I smell bad, they all say I don\u2019t smell like b.o. at all, one friend even said I smelled too clean like a lush store. \n\nI am getting so paranoid. He won\u2019t cuddle or anything when he says I smell. I really don\u2019t know what more I can do?\n\nUpdate  - so unexpected edit. I waited for him to make a comment this morning so I could talk to him. It was less than an hour after waking up that he said \u201cgod you stink\u201d I had already showered and put on deodorant. \nI snapped and asked what exactly was he smelling because, at this point I\u2019m one of the cleanest people on the planet and if I still smell bad to him then we should just break up. \n\nHe got all  panicked and upset, I eventually got out of him that this is what he father always said to his mother. Apparently his father told him that is was a sure fire technique to have a woman never leave you because \u201cshe will feel too low to cheat, will love only you, and will always be clean\u201d.\n\nNeedless to say, his father is wrong. He\u2019s packing his things and moving out of my house today.",

Needless to say I dumped him but it took me 6 more months than I should have taken\n\nHe basically was 150 pounds when we met. He used to be 300. He gained until 260 between 1 -1.5 yr together. In the last 1.5-2yr he put me down to keep me. Because he felt emotionally that he was not good enough so he had to make me feel bad so we could be that way together\n\nIt\u2019s The *biggest bullshit*.... I *even* helped him go to the gym and eat right. I was supportive and never called him fat or anything I just led by example: going to the gym myself. I\u2019d ask if he wanted to go with. I\u2019d cook healthy food. But he\u2019d always ruin the healthiness with crazy portions.\n\nIn the end he mourned losing my fit ass. He kept showing up with roses. It was too late mate. I found someone else after 5-7 months of being solo and getting things straight (for example knowing I was a nice and pretty person and that no one should treat me like that!) \n\nHang in there op!\n\nGlad you\u2019re rid of him\n\nPeople like that don\u2019t deserve to have you. That\u2019s such a LOW thing to do; trying to make others unhappy&amp; bringing them down to your sheisty level on purpose. The fuckers. I hope they learn and don\u2019t do that shit to another woman. \n\nDefinitely getting friends opinions on the things you\u2019re put down for by him is a good idea. Then you have a non biased opinion. If they disagree call him out like OP did!! Look at the answer that OP got from her Bf! Terrible! A stranger isn\u2019t even that mean to people. Never mind someone who supposed to love you!\n\nThose men need to be dumped hard. They need to know you would have stayed with them otherwise - and that their logic is so wrong. That they will only keep a woman with compliments. \n\nCriticism should be objective and *should always be constructive not mean* \n\n... being mean (&amp; not trying to help solve the issue if there actually IS a real issue) tells you everything you need to know about that person. Snipping and insulting someone each day for the same thing and not helping them when they\u2019re making an effort to keep you happy and solve the issue means you\u2019re a dick.\n\nEdit: thanks for the gold!",

I was in a verbally abusive relationship that was veeery subtle, and only had a light bulb moment at the end because I was mature enough to question my feelings and google signs of abuse, albeit after an entire year. I spent a lot of energy making sure I didn\u2019t look ugly, turn him off with my \u2018antics\u2019, or be too sensitive when he did things that were hurtful. The way he behaved with me molded me into this paranoid person who kept failing him.  \n  \nBefore that, I would always scoff at the idiot women who stayed with abusers. Now, being a totally normal person who is definitely not weak-willed or insecure (even back then), I can see how easy it is for anyone to be manipulated.  \n  \nWe all laugh at dumb advertisements in commercials and product placement in movies, but there\u2019s a reason they\u2019re there: because they work. We are all, to varying degrees, susceptible to manipulation. Admitting it is the key to getting out.",

I hope now that he\u2019s aware of what he did, and how very WRONG it is, he gets some help. He probably needs therapy of some kind after growing up with that kind of an example of marriage. As for you, OP, you dodged a damn bullet. Imagine twenty years down the line, the other manipulative and abusive tactics he would have used thinking it was okay because that\u2019s what his father did. I encourage you to talk to someone, there may have been other things he had done that effected your self worth or actions that you just don\u2019t realize yet. I applaud you for splitting with him! You don\u2019t need that trash, and if you want to stay in a relationship it is going to be because there is mutual respect and love, not because you feel as though no one else will love you.

The mysteries of human attraction are that smell is hugely important to compatibility, it tells your partner whether you fit together in ways we can't start to understand, pheromones, immunity, whatever. It might just be that chemically you aren't a match, in spite of looks, personalities, senses of humour, sex drive, your body smells like it doesn't suit his body, so if you smell of *anything* apart from artificial chemicals he doesn't like it. I love the way my wife smells, she says I never smell bad, even when I can smell myself. That to me is a chemistry that works. By contrast my brother went out with a girl at university, she was really sharp, funny, great looking and so into my brother. He broke up with her and when, incredulously I asked why, he shamefacedly said that in the morning she smelt like our mum. I understood. You can't have your girlfriend smell like mum.

It was almost addicting to be around his scent. It wasn't that he did anything special either, just showered daily. I could even smell it after he got off work. \n\nAnother guy (I was a stupid kid and got fooled into thinking he cared) had a strong scent that just made my nose say WTF. It was musky and not horrid but i didn't like it. I met someone later who had a very similar musk and my brain just said stay the f away.\n\nPheromones work and we can smell them, just not to the level that most animals can. I say that if its just the person insisting that their partner smell bad and everything else is fine in the relationship then i agree its probably a scent incompatibly issue.",

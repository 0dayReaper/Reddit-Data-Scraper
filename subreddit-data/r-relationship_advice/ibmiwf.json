    "postText": "&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nHello, I guess in some way I wanted to give you people an update on what has been going on with me. When I posted my first post, I was slightly drunk, it was the night the police showed up at my house and rang the doorbell and I was confused. All of your messages, messages from random strangers, helped me in some way. I\u2019d like to thank whoever sent me that poem by Mary Elizabeth Frye - Do not stand at my grave and weep, we used that for the invitation to her party. And also Bianca who painted that beautiful painting of her which she sent me by email. Thank you. \n\nAlso, fair warning, this might be quite a long post, this might trigger someone and I\u2019ve been writing this post over several days as more information keeps trickling in and the picture of that night is becoming clearer and clearer. I think I'm also mainly writing this for myself.\n\nWhat happened that night (the 22nd of July) is just still so surreal.\n\nI'm sitting at my mothers desk right now, in her little office in our apartment that I grew up in, in Berlin. Her presence in some way is all around me. It has been 23 days since the police showed up in front of my door at 3 in the morning and asked if they could come in. Since my stepfather hung himself. Everything has been so confusing\n\nIt's all sort of a mixture between crying, screaming, yelling, throwing things, and just emptiness. I go through phases (someone linked that famous post about grief and god it's so accurate) and it's really hard to cope. Since that night I haven't ever actually been alone. This is somewhat exhausting to me in some ways but probably also very important. \n\nI\u2019m going to go through the series of events and facts because I also want to set it right, since in the media (since some of you found the articles online and connected the dots) there is so much false information, it\u2019s hard to believe. \n\nMy Mother and my stepfather were together for 8 years and he has only been living in Berlin since then. He has children from his previous marriage, that is all I will say. I am my mothers only daughter. \n\nHe did not call me and confess to what he did (as many report) but he called some vaguely mutual friend who he walks his dog with sometimes. This was some time after 11 PM. At this point he was already up at the summer house. It takes about 1 hour and 45 minutes to get up there. This means my mother had been dead for about 2 hours (it says so in the police report as well). \n\nThe summer house did not belong to my stepdad, but to my mom. She poured all of the little money she had and renovated it by hand. It does not in any way belong to him. \n\nThe police showed up at my moms and my apartment late at night, they didn\u2019t know the address of where he might have gone and were also worried he might come and harm me since he had the keys to our apartment as well. I was watching a movie with a friend of mine. \n\nI posted on reddit a few hours later, the news articles started coming out the next day, connecting my stepfather to a celebrity. I posted because I needed help. \n\nThis celebrity and my stepfather are by no means \u201efriends\u201c they are acquaintances and there is no reason for him to be brought into any of this.\n\nThat was wednesday night/thursday morning. On friday I was at the LKA (criminal police) and gave a 3 hour statement about them and their relationship.\n\n***(This next part is about my feelings and mainly about my mom, feel free to skip it)***\n\nSince then my whole world has been turned upside down. My mother, the person I honestly loved most in the whole world was just torn from me. It feels like I have this big bleeding hole inside of me. I\u2019m not crying all the time, sometimes I feel ok, but more like empty. \n\nMy mother has been with me my whole life, the whole 21 years and I\u2019m not just saying this because she is dead, she is honestly the best mother you could wish for. She is goofy and caring, her laugh is infectious, she has such integrity. She is the most animated person, when she tells a story she will get up from the table and gesture all around. Her eyes are so shining. I think I might show some pictures of her, because I want people to recognise her beauty. I want the whole world to know she is gone. Because this is an honest and devastating loss to the world, believe me. \n\nShe is so talented. She got her bachelor in Art History in America, she has worked odd jobs all her life. She\u2019s always been a hippie. When I was little she started working at this English-language summer camp in Th\u00fcringen in Germany and she used to take me there for many weeks with her, on a hill, on a farm in the middle of a giant forest. \n\nShe\u2019s a magician in the kitchen, she can open the fridge door and magically make something out of leftover ingredients that nobody would ever think tastes good (noodles and carrots anyone?). \n\nShe likes to make everything herself. She would let milk go bad and make her own ricotta, I have a thousand jars of her homemade chutneys and jams. She baked her own bread years before the pandemic. She made her own vinegar, her own syrups and alcohol and her hot sauces are legendary. I used to come home and open the fridge door and I\u2019d ask her which of the many bowls she had covered with little plates were edible, and which weren\u2019t ready yet. \n\nSince she\u2019s dead I have found so many started experiments of things I don\u2019t even know what they are. I wish I could ask her. There are so many things I wish I had the time to ask her. Writing this is making me cry again. \n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, March I believe, I moved back in with her and she ordered 14 different bottles of white wine on Lidl and every night we\u2019d drink one together while we cooked and I\u2019d write notes on the color and the taste and we\u2019d give it a 1-10 on the Lidl scale.\n\nShe\u2019s one of the funniest people I know. And she is so forgiving. Even when I was younger we would get into huge blow up fights sometimes and we\u2019d scream. But five minutes afterwards she\u2019d come into my room and she\u2019d apologise and tell me she loved me more than anything in the world. \n\nWe told each other we loved one another all the time, sometimes just randomly and hug each other. I\u2019m so so grateful for this.\n\nI would say we had a rare mother-daughter bond. I love her with all my heart, she has always been my idol, my role-model. If I\u2019m even half the person she is, as generous, hilarious, creative, emotional, forgiving and understanding, I will be lucky. I see her face in front of me all the time. I can hear her laugh. \n\nFuck, I\u2019d really give anything for her to be with me right now. Anything. It really tears me apart. \n\nIf it weren\u2019t for her, I would have probably been dead 1 1/2 years ago. She pulled me out of my dark holes, she loved me unconditionally. She isn\u2019t just my mother, she is my best friend. And I will never ever forgive him for taking her from me. Especially since more and more facts are coming out. \n\n***(End of emotional bit)*** \n\nIt\u2019s important to preface that I knew their relationship, or to be more exact, I was the closest to both of them together. And it\u2019s important to understand that he wasn\u2019t some creepy, abusive, scary bad guy. \n\nI loved him. He was like a best friend to me. When he came into my mothers and my life, I took him in with open arms. I\u2019ve confided in him, I\u2019ve told him secrets, we\u2019ve had running jokes. We made bets with each other that I usually won and he had to pay up. He was my family. \n\nThis makes me feel just as conned. I feel cheated. I feel like I\u2019ve been blind. I\u2019ve had bad fights with him as well and I knew about their fights but I didn\u2019t see this coming, not even a little bit. \n\nI would never put my mother in harms way. I guess this is why she must have kept things hidden from me. \n\nThe murder happened in his apartment (they had separate apartments) and afterwards he drove his car up to my mothers country house that they both spent every weekend at. Hunting mushrooms, planting and building things, going swimming in the lake thats right in front of the door. This was their refuge and I\u2019m assuming this is the reason he went there. \n\nSince the day this has happened I\u2019ve always assumed he blew up about something, lost control and he killed my mother while he wasn\u2019t clear headed. This is what made sense to me. That he killed himself because he killed my mother. Because he didn\u2019t know how to continue. \n\nBut the more time goes by and the more facts we uncover (we being my mothers friends and I, not the police), the more it seems it was the opposite. \n\nThat he killed my mother because he wanted to kill himself. And that he was covering something up. \n\nSince the night the police showed up, they\u2019ve been asking me if I could know where their laptops are, they both had a laptop. And both are missing. They found the empty cases, but they\u2019re gone. \n\nThis sparked suspicion in us. His phone is gone as well, my mothers is not, the police gave it to me. Then there are the other facts. (TRIGGER WARNING) Despite what it said in the media, she didn\u2019t have multiple stab wounds in her chest. There was only one very precise and very small wound that caused her death. He only let someone know what he did after he was up at the house. When he arrived at the cabin, he apparently parked normally, even greeted one of the neighbours.\n\nThe pieces are falling into place. That this was cold blooded.\n\nI don\u2019t really know why I\u2019m writing all this down in a word document and why I\u2019m going to post it on reddit, but I need to share. \n\nI feel so much hatred and so much anger. I feel it boiling underneath my skin and it keeps threatening to come out. I\u2019ve smashed so much stuff, I\u2019ve gotten so angry. Sometimes I snap and I scream at people and other times I just cry and beat my pillows. And sometimes I\u2019m very calm. I can still feel joy. And my mother has this amazing circle of friends that I\u2019ve known my whole life and who are supporting me. I saw her body in the coffin and I will never be able to get that image out of my head. She was so tiny, it breaks my heart. \n\nI\u2019ve also slept two nights at the cabin and in the dark every shadow looked like my stepfather. I\u2019ve become scared and started locking my doors at night. Murder used to seem something so far off, something that happened to other people, in a different world, separate from mine. But now it\u2019s not. And I won\u2019t let him spoil her place, her house. I won\u2019t let him take that away from her and from me. I refuse. \n\nI just miss her. I miss everything about her. It hasn\u2019t been that long yet and all I want is for her to hug me and say my name and say she loves me and that she thinks I\u2019m an amazing young woman. I want her to cuddle with me in bed which she did for so many years until I felt myself too old. \n\nI want to sit at the kitchen table in the morning with her and have her ask me what I dreamt about last night and have both of us talk about our dreams. For her to talk with me about my story ideas and my poetry and to talk with her about the book that she was writing and will never finish. \n\nIt just hurts so much, I don\u2019t know how to ever get past this. She has always been the most amazing person I know and I can\u2019t get over this. I don\u2019t know how to get over this. I feel lost. I feel like I have to grow up very fast now and carry her with me. \n\nTheres so much more to tell. So much. But I should probably stop somewhere. I would appreciate all advice. \n\nThank you for reading.\n\n\nEdit: don't know if I did this right, I don't usually use imgur https://imgur.com/gallery/lkjz7Wd",

I don\u2019t need to have known your mother to feel her loss and know what a special woman she was because all that was strong and wonderful about her lives on in you. It\u2019s evident in this post. I hope you get the clarity you deserve. I hope you uncover that whole truth you seek so you can find some degree of closure. I\u2019m sorry that justice was denied to you but sometimes justice brings us no peace. Only love can bring us peace in the end and you have it in abundance. Lean on your support system. Live well and live honestly and embody your mother in all the good you\u2019ll do in your life. Good luck putting the puzzle together, OP. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever be able to forget this story and I\u2019m glad of that.",

I [commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hw6zxn/i_dont_really_know_what_to_say_the_police_just/fyy4wjl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) on the original post because I went through something so similar. \n\nI want to thank you for the update; it couldn\u2019t have been easy to write. But more than that, I\u2019m glad to see you on Reddit just to know you\u2019re still around. \n\nThe part of this post that most struck me was you spending time in the cabin. I remember the days in my father\u2019s house after his murders and suicide so vividly, and looking back on it, I wish I hadn\u2019t gone there at all. Which leads me to this: you don\u2019t have to do things the hard way. You don\u2019t have to make things harder on yourself. When grief as raw and shocking as what you\u2019ve experienced takes over, we sometimes want to swim in it because at least feeling something is better than remaining numb, feeling hollow. But I want to lovingly and gently encourage you to make sure you\u2019re taking care of yourself. \n\nI also want to reiterate how useful a trauma-informed therapist can be. I was dead-set against therapy after my father\u2019s crimes happened. I thought I could handle everything on my own. After all, I\u2019d always been the \u201cstrong\u201d one. I waited a year to find a counselor, and if I could change a single thing I did, it would be that\u2014I\u2019d have sought out help sooner. I didn\u2019t really know how to ask for help at the time\u2014it took me years to learn how\u2014but it would\u2019ve been immeasurably useful to have someone help me through all of that. \n\nLike you, I was in my 20s when my father killed his girlfriend, her daughter, then himself. That was sixteen years ago. There is a life on the other side of all of this trauma and heartbreak. I promise. And the book I just finished writing about it was finally handed in on the last day of July. Maybe someday it can help you (and others). \n\nI have thought of you many times since your first post. My offer to reach out at anytime stands. Any. Time.\n\nEdited to add: quite a few people asked about the book in this thread and via DM. It\u2019s with my agent now, so at earliest it would be out in a year (books take forever). The title is We Run To Crush The Grass. Thank you for the interest, but please focus on OP. She needs the love and kindness of strangers.",

            "comment": "Sadly I can understand everything you're going through. My mother was murdered a month before my 23rd birthday. It's a hard way to grow up. It's even harder when you talk with older people you've grown up trusting, teachers, pastors, your friend's parents, and you realize that their own parents are still alive and that they really don't understand being so incredibly alone. Burying my mother was the hardest thing I'd ever done in my life. My father had died before her, of cancer. It was a relief really when he passed, because he wasn't in pain anymore. My mother though, that was a hard, bitter shock.\n\nI commented when you first posted : [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hwtmm4/update_my_stepfather_killed_my_mother_and_then/fz2itux/?context=3) I've reposted the part about dealing with the pain below, simply because writing about it again brings up a lot of my own pain. I do hope it helps.\n\nI want to tell you that it gets better, that the pain goes away over time. I suppose it does, but its always there. You'll fill the hole a bit as you get older, you get married, you have children, you travel, see things, do things. But she'll always be there, just the times when you think of her and think of how much you miss her, those moments will get a bit farther apart. For me it's been twenty five years since it happened and I can tell you typing this up, remembering it all, puts tears in my eyes.\n\nYou'll dream of her. Incredibly vivid dreams, where she isn't dead, she just went away on a trip. And this is natural, it's just your mind trying to soothe the pain. Honestly those dreams are the worst, but they're also reassuring. Sometimes you'll see something, or hear something that reminds you of her and you might cry or just want to be alone. And that's natural too. You can't dictate how you feel, or what you feel. And don't try to hide it or ignore. When it comes, it comes, and let it. It's healthier to embrace these moments of sorrow than to deny them.\n\nThrough this entire process you're going to laugh sometimes. You'll find something that brings up a memory, something silly or just completely ridiculous and you'll find yourself laughing, maybe even crying too. Again, this is natural. Hold on to those memories, maybe even hold on to the things that bring them back. Take your time on figuring out what to do with her things, because once you give them away, donate them, or sell them, they're gone. The best way to remember her is to remember the times you laughed together, the times she made you smile, or think, or believe in yourself. He may have taken her from you, but those moments, they will stay inside you forever. And really, the ones we love are never really gone. She will always be with you; how you live, how you love, how you carry yourself, that's as much a reflection of her love for you as anything else.\n\nLike I said, it isn't easy, but you will manage. Let yourself laugh, let yourself love and you'll be ok.\n\nGehen mitt Gott.",

This shouldn't have happened to you. She was taken away cruelly and its unfair. So many people on here are cheering for you and glad to see you're still on here. \n\nI'm so glad you aren't letting her place be tainted by the bad memories your stepfather left and hope that in time visiting the cottage will continue to keep her alive for you as you can see all the love she put into decorating and maintaining that place. May it be a place where you can recharge and feel her spirit with you and that it would provide comfort just being there. \n\nThank you again for your update!

            "comment": "I'm so sorry for your loss. Things are hard now, but the pain does dull with time.\n\nMy father figure passed away from COVID-19 in March. He randomly fell ill one night and got rushed to the hospital. Initially we were told that it was pneumonia and at one point it looked like he was recovering. A few days later we were told it was the dreaded virus and he died a couple days after that. Sadly because he fell ill at the start of the pandemic, he died at the hospital far from everyone he knew. \n\nI often find myself wondering what his last moments were like. He was put on a ventilator when the virus attacked his lungs, but the doctors took him off it when his breathing didn't improve. No one thought he would die, even he assumed he'd recover. \n\nPart of me hates the doctors who took him off his ventilator.  It feels like they killed him and not the virus. Part of me also hates my Prime Minister. My father figure would have survived if the lockdown had started earlier. We believe he contracted the virus from an Uber he took to work. He was 70 and disabled. Had our government actually admitted that the virus was as deadly as it turned out to be, he would kept himself safe at home. Our Prime Minister himself even contracted the virus, but he recovered. Part of me hates him for surviving. Why does he get to live while my father figure had to die.\n\nMy father figure was one of the purest souls you could ever hope to meet. His early life was awful as he grew up with an extremely abusive father. He later built a decent life for himself far from his humble beginnings, only to be brought down by his employer who pinned the blame on him for some dodgy deals. He fell back to the bottom and lost most of his wealth to legal costs. Just when he thought life couldn't get any worse, he was involved in a car accident and broke his spine. He was able to continue walking, but was in pain 24 hours a day due to the internal damage done. On top of that, his wife left him because she didn't want to be with a crippled husband who couldn't provide for her.\n\nDespite all the crap he went through, he never stopped being a good person. In his 50s he decided to become a humanitarian and dedicated the rest of his life trying to help the vulnerable, poor and discriminated members of our community. Even though he was constantly in pain, he worked almost 24 hours a day. He changed the life of everyone who met him for the better, including me.\n\nWhen I met him I was in a really bad place. I was living with my biological father who treated me as his literal and metaphorical punching bag. I was depressed, hadn't experienced happiness for a decade and was suicidal. My father figure took me under his wing. He built up my confidence and encouraged me to escape from my father. He completely changed me. I'm nothing like the person I was when I first met him.\n\nI miss him so much. Some days the grief fades and the giant hole in my heart that opened when he died doesn't seem to exist. On these day I can go about my life as if everything is \"normal\". Other days,l I'll be reminded of him by something random and I'll literally cry myself to sleep.\n\nI really hope he's still here watching over me and I'll get to see him again one day... I hope you are also reunited with your wonderful mother too someday.\n\nEdit: spelling",

Your mother was a beautiful person and she would be so proud and touched to know what a beautiful picture you painted of her.\n\nAt the same age my ex-husband went through something a bit similar, but then again also a lot different. His depressed father tried to kill his mother and commit suicide. He didn't succeed though. His mom is paralyzed in a wheelchair and his dad went to prison. But he had a dysfunctional family with a very narcissistic mom, so obviously very different. The only advice related to this story I can give is: if you didn't already, please seek therapy. My ex never did and it changed his personality. \n\nAnyway, I can't imagine the hurt you are feeling. It warms my heart though that you can share your hurt with your moms friends. \n\nBig internet hugs.",

I know nothing can make this better but try and focus on the great gift you had of 21 years of the best mother you could wish for. It doesn't make it any better, and you deserved a long life with her, but when it feels overwhelming remember the good times. Remind yourself of how great she was and all of the intangible gifts she gave you. You deserve to be angry and sad about the time with her that was taken from you, but those feelings will only hurt you more it won't punish the man that did this. She would want you to find joy in her memory and continue to live your life well. Find strength in her memory and her love. Celebrate the time you had with her and all of the love she put in you to make you the person you are. You will always have that.",

For awhile I thought that I should have protected her or saved her from this. But I couldn't help someone with needing help myself.. She passed away never getting to meet her grandsons, and nieces, who really need her. Anyway I just wanna send my condolences and just know that time will heal. You won't ever stop missing her but if you remember the good things and how beautiful she was, then that's how she gets to live again. Life is so mathematical, but some times shit happens.

I actually fear the day and get choked up just thinking about it because she\u2019s so important to me. I can tell that you loved your mom beyond belief and I can see how well she raised you. She seems like such a warm and amazing person. I am happy for you that you have such great memories to treasure. It sounds corny, but you will have those memories forever. She will always be there with you because of that. Continue to talk about her and keep her memory alive. You also have a talent for writing. Your words were so beautiful and expressed well. I really encourage you to keep writing. Keep a journal of everything you\u2019re thinking of, it will be very therapeutic for you. I don\u2019t know what else to say.. just wanted to let you know you\u2019re in my thoughts and I wish I could give you a hug right now. Sending you love \u2764\ufe0f",

It helped me when my grandmother died. Anyway, all the feelings are going to take you awhile to get over. They are very strong. Please keep your mother's friends close. Be alone with your feelings if you need to. Talking is good. So is not talking. I don't know what you are going through but I understand emotions. Don't keep them in. They eat away like acid on flesh. Remember all the great times you spent with your mother. Carry on her traditions. Keep them alive. For you both. Try to figure out what happened but don't let anger eat you up. Try to forgive far down the road if you can. Be good to yourself.",

I know I'm just a stranger, but I have kids about your age and your loss really hits me - and my daughter just moved to Germany, which makes your story all the more relatable.\n\nYou memorialize her so beautifully. I know she would never have felt like she had shared everything there was to share with you, not even close - but I know for sure that if you feel and remember all those things about your mom, she definitely got all the important things cemented in you, and it will absolutely form the basis for the adulthood you go on to forge for yourself. \n\nBe patient and kind with yourself while you navigate your grief, you know your mother would want that for you. Don't suffer relationships with people who are not kind about your loss. Don't tolerate people telling you that you should be over it on some sort of schedule.\n\nI wish you the best thing forward. I wish I could give you a big non-quarantine hug! Be well.",

I can't even begin to imagine how you must feel. \n\nYour mom seems like an amazing woman and the way you express yourself about her is a testament to it. Girl, you made me cry. \n\nAfter reading every single word you wrote, I just sat at my table, staring to the void thinking, what can I say to this amazing young lady to ease her pain, to try and help her even if it's a tiny bit? What can I say that the rest of the world hasn't yet? \n\nI'm a woman of faith. I don't care if the world thinks I'm crazy and delusional, I find tremendous comfort, peace and solace in GOD, and if you do believe too, I suggest you reach out to your community.\n\nAlso I believe in science (yes, it's possible) and it's my personal experience that therapy helps tremendously. Of course it's not a magic pill, it does take time but it absolutely works once you find a therapist you have rapport with. \n\nThe advice I'm going to give you might be shocking to you and to many others, I might even be downvoted,  but I promise you it's the only way to heal. You need to forgive whoever needs to be forgiven in this terrible situation It also takes time and it's a process but a liberating one. It's something you need to do for yourself. There are many books written on the subject. \n\nI was thinking that as a last tribute to your mom, maybe if you feel comfortable with the idea, you could finish writing the book she started. It would be like the last project you two did together and it would probably give you some solace and a sense of direction now that you feel somewhat lost. Girl, you write beautifully and that's in English, can't imagine how amazing you write in your mother tongue. \n\nMay GOD guide you, bless you and keep you always and in all ways and may HE fill you with peace and grant you solace, comfort and healing\u2763\ud83d\ude4f\n\nIf I'm repeating from other people's advices, I'm sorry, I didn't read them. After reading you I came straight to write to you.",

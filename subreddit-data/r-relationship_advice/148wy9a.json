    "postText": "My friend and I have been close for the longer half of a decade and only recently has she started maintaining longer eye contact when we have been going out in groups. We used to be closer before but stopped contact for a few years because she changed schools. However, recently, we started reconnecting and are now in the same friend group. We've never really had any romantic interactions, most of them were as either really close friends or just friends in general. But in our latest hangout together with our friends, she wouldn't stop eye contact with me. \n\nWe were all having dinner together, there were 7 people in total. I sat on one end of the table and she sat on the other end. We all finished our food and started talking with one another. But, shortly after, I realised that she was looking at me so I looked back at her, however, she didn't stop. She continued holding eye contact and smiling whilst talking to the whole group,  BUT NOT ONCE did she look away, and neither did I. She has never done this before and only that day did she start doing so. \n\nSoon after we finished getting the bill, we went and got ice cream with the whole group. I picked out chocolate whilst others picked matcha however my friend (20F) did not pick out anything. If I were to remember correctly, she liked matcha more than chocolate but only asked me for some of my ice cream. Anyway on that same day, she was more clingy than ever before. \n\nDespite all this, a few months back, we had a conversation about relationships and dating. She said that she wasn't ready for it and would much consider to wait til she graduates from college since she wants to focus on her studies because her family prioritises studying over other things in life. So basically this conversation made me doubt my assumptions and I doubt myself even more because she was never really the type to show her feelings openly. \n\nAs cheesy as this post can be, I am generally curious on why she has recently started to act more clingy. So, please tell me if this is just a coincidence or if something really is going on with her. Sorry for how cringe this post might seem to you :)",

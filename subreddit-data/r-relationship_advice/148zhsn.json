    "postText": "TL;Dr mentioned paying for hotel and other expenses and gf got angry, this has happened before.\n\nSo I took my girlfriend on a 3 day trip and paid for the hotel along with some expensive \u201cvacation items\u201d along with driving her there in my car (6 hour drive) and paying for the gas. When it came to going out for food/drinks, we both took turns paying the bill (with her buying a little more for inexpensive things like breakfast).\n\nI was more than happy to treat her (even though I am not rich), but it all came to a head on our last evening, when she asked if we could split the bill for our dinner. \n\nI had bought the expensive dinner the night before and my funds were running a little low until the next paycheck. So I (probably not tactfully, was admittedly a little tipsy) brought up how I\u2019m treating her to this hotel and bought all the hotel Party supplies and am happy to do so.\n\nShe ended up getting furious and saying how a man shouldn\u2019t have to mention treating her to something and that men don\u2019t brag about favors like that and that I \u201cdidn\u2019t make her feel special.\u201d\n\nShe then proceeded to calculate how much the hotel and other goods were, and told me to take the money (even with my apologizing and saying no).\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time this has happened either\u2014I have taken her out for dinner and food sometimes and later asked if she enjoyed the evening (without her saying thanks for dinner), and she gets and angry.\n\nNow she says she wants to split everything exactly even and for me to never treat her to something.\n\nAm I acting in the wrong here? What should I differently? Or is this a sign of something in the relationship? Any advice is welcome because this basically ruined my vacation and is causing bigger problems.",

We could go somewhere cheaper.\u201d\n\nCommunicate openly about things like this. \n\nIt sounds like your girlfriend is uncomfortable with what\u2019s happened. If someone treats you, but then keeps reminding you of that, it can end up feeling pretty coercive. So she\u2019s dealing with that by laying a boundary of you splitting things. It sounds like that could be a good call in this situation to avoid things like this.",

That could cause anxiety and make her want to just keep things even from now on so she doesn\u2019t feel like you have leverage.\n\nI\u2019d say maybe in the future make sure you mention when you\u2019d like her to pay BEFORE you go so she doesn\u2019t feel blindsided. Or on trips figure out both of your budgets together so neither person is going outside of their means.\n\nI would say her getting upset and not thanking you for other dinners is concerning, although I\u2019d have to understand why she\u2019s upset and get more info.\n\nMaybe going 50/50 would work better for you two, but if her offer to do so wasn\u2019t genuine and was instead a guilt-tactic then that is a sign that there\u2019s a problem with the relationship.",

If you've been dating for more than 6 months say, then you should be at a stage where you are able to communicate freely (not insult each other, but not feel hesitant to bring up stuff). \n\nIt's not great to imply that you have given her a lot of things so she should pay this once, it reduces her sense of esteem. But, at the same time, you should be able to apologise and have an open discussion about this. It's not about splitting the bill X times or taking turns to pay, that depends on the couple in question. It's more about how she could be a bit more understanding of your situation. I particularly don't like the phrase \"make me feel special\" in this solely monetary context, it doesn't sound good. \n\nTalk to her openly and if she gets your point, cool. Whether you split the bill or not afterwards is up to you two, but you need partners to be understanding as well.",

    "postText": "As the title says. I love her and would do anything for her. I have not always been the best boyfriend, I have probably been horrible at times, but I have definitely tried, and according to her, have improved, and we are also best friends and have a lot of fun together, we are perfect for being travel buddies, we love to hike, we love to read, you name it. The last few years she goes into these cycles where she feels like she doesn't feel anything for me. She cannot forget the times I have hurt her, so even when I improve, those memories are still there. No, there is no infidelity involved. One example is when her friends threw a surprise birthday party, and they all wanted me to come, but my dumbass refused to go because I decided homework was more important, that is something I regret because I really hurt her. Also, sometimes I would forget to open the door for her, and I am very good at that now, but she can't forget. I have definitely improved and try very hard to be better. But she will never forget. She thinks she wants to break up with me, but she isn't exactly sure and it breaks her heart to even think about it. It's just unfortunate, at least once a month, she feels very distant, she doesn't want to hug me, and doesn't feel anything for me. Usually for a good portion of the month she's over the moon and very in love with me, but we cannot deny that this is problematic. What would be the best course of action? I love her to death and definitely would have loved to grow old and die with her, but obviously she doesn't always feel the same way and I want her to be happy, even if that means not being together anymore. I am very lonely and have no one else to talk to, so I figured I would talk to Reddit. \nMore information, she says it may be our relationship that does this, but she also says that her problems at home, her toxic family, is also a source of her poor mental health. She would love to move out, but places are unaffordable. So, what do we do, do I let her go and accept it, should we work it out, what is the path forward? I was planning on asking to marry her this summer, but that went out the window lmao. \n\nAlso, in case she does break up, how the hell do I meet people? I have no one, and I don't talk to my family like this since we are all not very close. I am literally alone.\n\nEdit: a detail I will add, It tends to happen after her period ends, but I agree that I don't want that to be a copout either. But it is definitely a cycle, and while this didn't always happen before, it is happening frequently at least once a month.\n\nNone of this hides the fact that this is problematic to our relationship and that it's affecting her negatively. And her feelings are 100 percent valid, the fact that this happens like this doesn't invalidate her feelings \ud83d\udc95",

I am not saying this as a cop out for relationship problems that are present, but she might perceive them more problematic when around her period. Might be worth for her to track her emotions and her period a little. I always get more negative towards life in general around the time of my period.",

    "postText": "Are our household duties split up evenly?\n\nI\u2019m asking because I think he does more than me. But he says we have things evenly split. I\u2019m 32F he is 33M. Not married but plan to be. Live together. \n\nWe both work full time. He makes $150k and I make around $70k. (Only saying this because I think it\u2019s important to note he is the primary money earner)\n\nI work from home full time, he works from home twice a week (his choice, he likes to go to the office, probably to get away from me lol)\n\nI tidy up every day - make the bed, arrange the pillows on the couch, put dirty clothes in the laundry, load the dishwasher, clean toilets, dust\n\nHe does 100% of the laundry once I put it in the washer. He washes it, hangs it up and puts it away or dries it and puts it away. I do nothing here. \n\nI 100% cook everything in this house 3 meals a day. If I don\u2019t make food, we don\u2019t eat. \n\nWe have a dog and live in a big city, no yard. I walk her in the morning and he walks her at night. Whoever is still awake later takes her out for a quick pee before bed. If I had a rough night sleeping (which is too often) he will take care of the morning walk without asking or waking me to let me sleep. \n\nI feel like he does too much considering I work from home 24/7. I feel bad he does laundry and takes the dog out in the morning when I don\u2019t sleep well, which is a couple times a week. I don\u2019t even know how to work our washer/dryer. Any thoughts?",

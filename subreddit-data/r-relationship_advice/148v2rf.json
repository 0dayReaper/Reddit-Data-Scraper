    "postText": "I recently starting dating my boyfriend and he wanted us to be exclusive pretty early in the relationship. He also asked me to move in with him and is trying to help me find a job in his city. He is really great with being present in my life and making time for me. He communicates every day and is extremely affectionate. He really goes above and beyond in every possible way. \n\nHowever, I do feel myself getting jealous of certain people in his life and I hate feeling this way. My father cheated on my mom and made me hide it from everyone when I was 5, so cheating in general does make me very emotional. In my experience, people always do messed up shit and stab each other in the back, so it's hard for me to trust others. My boyfriend is so amazing though, and I don't know why I can't just trust him. I want to be able to believe the best about him, but my paranoia always tells me to exit and make a run for it. Here are a few examples of people I'm jealous of:\n\nA woman who works under him. He used to have a minor crush on her and he snuggled with her last year after a work event and asked her if she has a crush on him. She said yes. He ended up rebuffing her because he found out she has very different life views from him. According to my bf, this woman is extremely sensitive and gets upset if he doesn't respond to her emails immediately. He told her that she should expect a response to her emails within 1 business day, but not within hours. He also mentioned to her in casual conversation that he's dating me. I told him that she sounds really manipulative and childish but he said \"no, she's not manipulative just extremely sensitive\". Like come on...I can smell her crazy BPD vibes from a mile away lol\n\nThere's a much younger woman who is a former intern of my bf. He describes her as cute, intelligent, sweet, and has a shining appearance. He keeps in touch with her and she shows him music she writes. He responds to her messages with the \"heart\" response. He wants to take me on a date to a restaurant she works at so we can say hi to her. Okay lol\n\nHe has a new intern from Romania. Her laptop  that she uses for work broke, so he went computer shopping to a bunch of different stores with her. He set up her new laptop and tried to help her recover lost documents and photos from her old computer. He couldn't recover all the documents but might try to figure out a way to do it later. Is this not way beyond the scope of what's reasonable to help an intern? Why is her failure to back up her documents his problem? \n\nI find myself getting very angry and cynical towards the above people. It feels like I'm always subconsciously competing with others and I hate it. It makes me miss being alone and reminds me of how much everyone just fucking sucks. What can I do to avoid feeling this way? Am I just not fit to be in a relationship?\n\nTLDR I'm a jealous and resentful person who wants to change. How?",

He says he's in love with me and has never felt this way for anyone before. I also absolutely hate where I live and he knows that.\n\nHe does seem like he seeks validation from women though, especially since he's not confident about his social skills and appearance (he's cute, but doesn't think he is). If he was a player, why would he be so enthusiastic about introducing me to everyone and moving me into his place?",

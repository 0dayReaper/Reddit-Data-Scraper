    "postText": "\nSo this is a long story but please, I need any advice I can get. \nSo the position I am in at work is one where I over see everything that deals with wiring, I am the technical trainer and have to talk to multiple associates daily about their training and evaluate them. \nNow my wife\u2019s parents and her sisters fianc\u00e9 all work there too. There\u2019s this one group where there was three new wires all at once and it genuinely takes some time the do full evals on each person and I have to do it multiple times with an official document for weeks, I track their records and make sure they\u2019re doing what they are supposed to. However there\u2019s this one who has stopped me outside a few times to talk about some things and even brought up some issues with other people in the building. So therefore I personally don\u2019t think I have talked to her much but others assume badly. I have to train these people how to do their job and I\u2019m told from my boss that if anyone asks for help I have to. So it didn\u2019t take long for rumors to start and the place I work is notorious for rumors. I\u2019ve been a few now and the most ridiculous one was I was cheating on my wife with my wife. So just keep that in mind. But it didn\u2019t take long for multiple people to start taking pictures and sending them to my wife and telling her I\u2019m cheating. But that\u2019s just not it. I love my wife with everything in me, I know I\u2019m my heart that she\u2019s the one for me and I\u2019m just so broken right now without her. We got married right out of HighSchool and I just can\u2019t stand to be away from her. But the pictures alone only show me standing next to this girl and talking, some inside and some outside the building. When my wife and I discussed this tho she brought up how she\u2019s felt unloved for so long and how she always put me before her and I truly thought that I was doing the same for her. But that was something I know I could work on and fix. I got distant from her a couple months ago but that my own depression and self hate the caused me to do that. I felt like she didn\u2019t want me anymore then and now to have all this blow up and her actually leaving me has left me feeling so heartbroken, I do understand things and see the perspective of it all but it\u2019s all not true and just assumptions. I have tried over and over to sit down and fix things but she just doesn\u2019t believe me right now. Between her parents and multiple people telling her the same thing she just doesn\u2019t believe me. We are taking a break from each other for a couple months before she decides what she really wants to do but I can\u2019t just sit here and let my whole happiness leave. I have tried over and over and she just doesn\u2019t want to talk to me. Please help me, what are some things I can try to fix things?",

The cheating rumor feels more like an excuse.\n\nYou've told her the truth. If you two are talking, I'd be asking her about the things she hasn't done that she wants to do as well as her needs she feels have been on a back burner and with the things that you can do within a marriage, I'd be encouraging her to do them. Letting her know that they are things that she can be doing married and that you'd be interested in doing some of those things together. \n\nPay attention to any needs and do what you can to show you listened to those needs",

She's unhappy, and the drama at work is her out. \n\nI know it's hard to hear, but if she really loved you, she'd put the effort in to make it work. I've known women who've been cheated on, right in their face, and still continued to make excuses and stay. I'm not saying by ANY means that this is right, but it's just the truth. \n\nIf you've done nothing wrong, then you don't deserve to feel any less for putting all the effort in that you have to make your relationship happy. Take care of you.\n\n\"If you love something, set it free. If it comes back, it\u2019s yours. If not, it was never meant to be.\"",

Anytime someone asks about your wife, tell him/her what really happened. \u201cShe\u2019s leaving me because I have to talk to my co-workers and the people here somehow think I should be able to do that without talking to anyone at all.\u201d The more ridiculous you can make it sound, the more likely it will work. Her family will take the story back to her or the co-workers will. Don\u2019t tell anyone that she suspects you of cheating. Defending yourself makes you sound more like a cheater to those who think you cheated. The only people who will think it\u2019s ridiculous are those who believe you. That\u2019s always how it works.",

Believing that a picture of your husband standing and talking to a female coworker is proof of cheating is beyond idiotic. As is believing someone's word of mouth without being given any factual evidence. \n\nThe main problem is that you both failed to communicate when you should have. And instead of doing so with you now she is choosing to run away and using bullshit as her reason why.",

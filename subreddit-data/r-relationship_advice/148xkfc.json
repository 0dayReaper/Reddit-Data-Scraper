    "postText": "My gf started acting cold a month ago, she does not show me any warmth anymore, it feels like she does not care about me anymore, the only thing i kept saying to myself is that we have exams this month and she is stressed af. But we met a few days ago and she basically said, that she does not know if she still wants to be together and that we will talk after the exams. We been together for 2 years and our relationship was never this bad. Is our relationship coming to an end? What should one do in this situation?",

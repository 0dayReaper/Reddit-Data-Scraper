    "postText": "My ex drunk called me late at night to tell me she got in bed with another man she met at a party. She said nothing happened and she felt guilty so she left him there to call me. She said things like \u201cI miss you, I wish it was you and I all I thought of was you so I left.\u201d \nWe just broke up a few days before because I wanted to end it. This made me really upset and all I can think of is how she can get this man all the way to bed and nothing happened. She tried to frame it as \u201cI could\u2019ve but I didn\u2019t because I still love you.\u201d I don\u2019t know how to process this. Am I being unreasonably upset? Someone please help me understand this feeling.",

How is calling your ex to tell them they \u201ctook someone home to have sex but didn\u2019t because they were wishing it was you\u201d even remotely ok?? Whether he or she ended it, that\u2019s a completely messed up thing to do to anybody and OP has a right to be upset. He may have been the one to end it but it doesn\u2019t mean all the feelings and care he had for her disappear automatically",

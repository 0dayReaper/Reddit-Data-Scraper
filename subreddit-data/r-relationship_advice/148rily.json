    "postText": "So I started seeing this girl back in March time and things were going really good back then. However I messed up and was rude to her in May. She asked for space which I gave her and we went a week with minimal contact. At the point where I messed up we were exclusive and only talking to one another. \n\nAfter we spoke again she asked to start again on page 1 and see how things went. I personally think they\u2019ve been going well. \n\nHowever I\u2019m unsure where I currently stand in this situation and whether she\u2019s entertaining other boys now that I messed up. \n\nWhat would be the best way to approach this and ask this question to her? \n\nI want to make sure I ask this in the right way so there is no risk element of losing her again or push her away again\n\nTLDR: Asking where I stand with a girl I\u2019ve been on and off with",

And why are you more worried that she's already moved on to others, than worrying that if she stays with you, or any other girl staying with you, might always mean they have to tolerate and go through your outbursts and that's not great. Why are you not asking, how can I stop screwing up? Because until you can manage your anger, whoever comes to your life will also leave.",

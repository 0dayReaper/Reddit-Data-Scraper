    "postText": "for context me (20f) and partner (19m) have been dating for about a year and a half. our relationship has never been perfect as we both have our own mental health issues although we do truly love and care for eachother. but recently we had been arguing more. usually because he has more of an avoidant attachment style where as i am anxious and communicate differently. in the space of 2 weeks he has asked for a \u201cbreak\u201d twice to determine wether we will break up or not. the first time he was already messaging me the first day and by the end of the day said he was miserable, wanted to jump off a building and couldn\u2019t be without me so we make up. today i express frustration about his lack of communication and he suggests another break as so he can decide wether we will break up or not although he will still text me and tell me he misses me and even told me he is \u201cwilling to wait for me\u201d but when i ask to make up he tells he still needs to decide wether we will stay together or not. he keeps telling me if i want to break up then i can do that although he knows that i won\u2019t do that because i am quite dependant on him. it kind of feels like he\u2019s taking advantage of the fact that he knows i won\u2019t break up with him? i\u2019ve told him how much this is affecting me and he just doesn\u2019t seem to understand. i don\u2019t know. any advise would be greatly appreciated.",

I thought I was going to lose my mind by the time I got out.\n\nFinally, you're being \"dependent\" on him isn't healthy. I'd feel he was taking advantage of this, too, were I in your shoes. You should probably discuss this particular aspect of the relationship with a therapist. Being dependent enough that even you see it is never a good dynamic and it can lead to mental/emotional abuse.",

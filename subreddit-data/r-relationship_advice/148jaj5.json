    "postText": "While I am senior to him I don\u2019t act in a supervisory role. That said, he is a junior at the start of his career and I would never want to do anything which would make him feel uncomfortable at work or dissuade him from joining our company permanently (he is essentially completing an internship for a few years). He may not end up working in my department permanently (and it\u2019s a massive company) but it\u2019s too soon to tell. \n\nPutting aside ethical and practical considerations, I can\u2019t tell if he is interested in me. We have a lot of eye contact. When he walks by my office, even though I share with others, he looks straight at me and holds my gaze as he passes. If we go out for work drinks I\u2019ll often catch his eye - he will tell a story or a joke and then I\u2019ll see him look to me to gauge my reaction. Conversely I wonder if there\u2019s a confirmation bias thing going on - is he looking at me because I am looking at him? \n\nI temporarily moved to a different city for work which is actually where he is from. Knowing I was alone there, he was home one weekend and invited me to have dinner with his parents and siblings at their family home. They were so welcoming and it was the sweetest gesture but can\u2019t tell if he was just being a nice guy or he\u2019s into me! Now that I am working away and don\u2019t see him, we message occasionally (through work devices) and although friendly it doesn\u2019t stretch too far into flirty. We have a lot in common and have a great time when we are together. For me it\u2019s more than just wanting to sleep him - I like him. \n\nAnother colleague knows of my crush and he senses that this guy likes me too but would never make a move (given the difference in our work positions and age gap). He says if anything is to happen I would need to be the one to do it.\n\nI just can\u2019t see a window where anything could happen. I don\u2019t want to be a creepy (senior and physically older) woman hitting on a young colleague if that\u2019s unwanted and (if he is interested) he probably doesn\u2019t want to do anything to a) jeopardise his job or b) act in case I don\u2019t reciprocate and it\u2019s awkward. People in our industry tend to date one another because it\u2019s busy and it\u2019s easier to be with someone who understand the demands of the job so dating a colleague is not entirely unusual (though obviously contrary to the popular advice!).\n\nDon\u2019t know whether to just be open with him about it and see if we are on the same page/decide what to do or just try my best to get over it.",

Since you're not his supervisor, your dilemma is legitimate. \n\nIf I were you, my first priority would be to ensure his career is not affected in any way. This includes, for instance, preventing him from feeling compelled to go elsewhere in case you make a move and for some reason  he rejects you. Even though you might say that would be a free decision, it would not. \n\nYour writing style somehow gave me the impression you are a resolute person. He should never feel embarassed or intimidated. Try to ascertain that he recirprocates to an extremely high degree of certainty, without explicitly making a move. And then if you believe he is emotionally strong enough to deal with it, make your move. \n\nYou know better than anyone how these things go in your industry, so I am sure you've got all the tools you need.",

I don't think it's universally awful to date someone at work, but it's dating on hard mode, you know? It's too easy to inadvertently make someone uncomfortable, or give the appearance of favoritism, or make your work environment uncomfortable if y'all break up and still have to work together.\n\nIf you do want to give this a shot, I'd at least hang out with the guy more irl before asking him out or saying anything about your feelings. I know you work from a different city, but you could see if he wants to grab drinks as friends sometime and feel out the vibes. If he isn't interested, or if you two get together and it feels really platonic, then you can assume it's a no and move on. If there's obvious chemistry, it's up to you whether it feels worth it to pursue anything further. FWIW, 26 isn't that much younger than 32. I would make sure it's okay for supervisors to date individual contributors at your workplace (sometimes that's an issue even if you don't supervise that particular person), and I would tread very lightly considering this guy is new to the working world. I would not date the guy, full stop, if you do work together (as opposed to being employed by the same organization but rarely or never actually doing work together).\n\nEdit: Also, I'd take into consideration the possibility that this guy may one day want to apply for a job on your team or that you may be moved over his team. You two dating could potentially affect his ability to move jobs and comfort in doing so, and that would be reason enough for me to not give this a shot.",

A guy might be fired or in jail if said coworker falsely accused him of wrongdoing. Now I don't think the OP's colleague will claim to have been sexually assaulted. I agree keeping it professional would be best. But calling the OP a predator seems out of line.",

    "postText": "Background: my wife and I familles are very religious and this was very much an arrangement marriage. Both are parents assumed we were both virgins, but my wife and I had sex with each other before our wedding, and we had a secret open relationship as well. We known each other our entire lives. \n\nWe ended the open relationship a few months before our wedding, but we continued to have sex with each other. There was a time where we stopped seeing each other as well, but this is common practice.\n\nI was living with my wife\u2019s family, and an uncle, or someone more cooler, made me feel more comfortable about the entire situation. I told him I wasn\u2019t a virgin, and my wife and I had an open relationship, but ended it. He then told me I would want to cheat in my marriage and said to just get it over with now. I was confused. \n\nHe then said I should have sex with another women, just in case, and because why not. I was very nervous about the wedding, and I think he was just saying advice (in good faith) that would try to make me feel better. I ended up sleeping with an escort, arranged by the uncle. I felt weird, but just told the uncle it made me feel better, as a thank you or something. \n\nIt\u2019s been 6 months, and now as a married man, I feel guilty about what I did. I don\u2019t know if I should tell my wife now, or potentially have this situation come out later from the uncle or something. I have bad judgment and don\u2019t know what to do?",

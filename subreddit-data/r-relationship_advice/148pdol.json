    "postText": "\n\nFriend trouble\n\nOkay I don't usually ask strangers for advice but here goes. My wife and I along with our 4 kids live in a really tight-knit neighborhood where most everyone is either acquaintances or friends and most have kids either the same age or near the age of our kids. My wife befriended a father in the neighborhood about a year back and they have since fostered a close  friendship. The father is only a few years older than my wife and I and is super friendly. He has been doing his absolute best to befriend me so that things are not weird but I just don't want to fuck with him. He is attractive and charming and works from home, as does my wife. Both I and his wife both work traditional 9-5 jobs but often have other responsibilities that keep us away for most of the day and our kids all go to school together and ride the same bus. My wife and the neighbor talk a lot and see each other quite a bit with the coming and going of the neighborhood and kids school. A while back things began to grow contentious between my wife and I when I found out that little by little he and his kids would come over to our house and play while I was not home. Things came to a head when I was made aware, after the fact, that he and his kids along with my wife and our kids all went to a kids museum about an hour away without myself or his wife for the day. I and a big problem with this and we discussed that from my perspective it looked like their relationship was potentially leaning toward at least emotionally cheating as she was spending far more time with someone else's husband than her own. I don't know if things ever moved passed the obvious optics of the situation and she swares it did not. I am highly inclined to believe her. Because of us talking though things she resolved to settle down and see him less and not without his spouse or myself present. Totally realistic and rational resolution to this. Well, while I don't think this behavior is happening anymore, he and his family still remain an active part of our life as we see them all the time and often attend or have parties with them. I know for a fact that they still text almost every day and are still very close. My question is, could it be percieved as crazy for setting these boundaries or could this be all in my head? I have never been the jealous type, and im curious as to if this is what jealousy feels like? For the sake of our relationship is it reasonable to ask for her to cut him out of her life completely? Try as i might, I can't seem to get over this and I want to hurt him every time I have to be around him. How reasonable are my feelings toward this situation?",

I knew my ex husband was friendly with a female in the group (chatted about TV shows, etc). The female and I also got pretty close. \n\nFast forward 6 months. One of the couples in the group had a BBQ. I stayed home with our child because they were sick. Woke up the next morning to my ex telling me he needed to talk to me. He confessed they\u2019d been having an affair for 6 months. Right under my nose as well as her husband\u2019s nose. They would get together while we were at work or out, etc\u2026 Always used the kids as an excuse (they would want to play together). \n\nIt all came to a head at the BBQ. Her husband had suspicions and printed off emails and text messages. Apparently he confronted them at the BBQ while I was home with a sick kid. \n\nI left him 2 weeks later. They married the day our divorce was final. \n\nIf your gut is telling you something is off, you\u2019re probably right.",

You don\u2019t put yourself in a situation to develop an emotional affair.  Sometimes this can happen naturally with no intent, and sometimes it happens because both people are just looking for something \u201cnew\u201d that feels \u201cdifferent\u201d, like a friendship with someone who\u2019s not your husband/wife\u2026and therein lies the issue\u2014that shouldn\u2019t happen.  These emotional bonds are formed especially secretly when the subject of conversation tends to be the spouse, and what they don\u2019t do/do wrong, or what they \u201cdon\u2019t get\u201d that this new person does (because they\u2019re only hearing one side).\n\nIf you never put yourself in a position to cheat, emotionally or physically, then it won\u2019t happen, but by continuing to communicate and form a bond, that bond can grow into a little tiny itch that needs to eventually be scratched.  \n\nThe answer to this would be a group chat.  They shouldn\u2019t need any privacy in their messages whatsoever if they\u2019re not talking ill of either of you, or doing anything weird.  Id tell her that not only you, but his wife should be in the group chat, and they shouldn\u2019t ever need to communicate privately bout her or you unless to plan a surprise party or something.\n\nYou need to set hard boundaries that are black and white, so if she breaks them or dude does, you get an immediate answer as to the severity of their \u201crelationship\u201d.  If you draw up a boundary that is convoluted and she breaks it, and then points out the \u201cgrey area\u201d you\u2019ve already lost.  Set a firm and hard boundary regardless of what it is, and tell her what breaking the boundary means for your marriage, and be crystal fucking clear on it, ensuring she fully understands the consequences and everything.",

            "comment": "1. Trust your gut. If no funny business is happening you will feel settled. If you feel texting is still crossing a boundary (which imo it is since any rational partner would see your previous reaction to random museum trips with already married men as valid and would (SHOULD) do anything to reassure you that you\u2019re both solid. Cutting off contact should have been the first step and is the least your partner could do. \n\n2. As the other parent to your children, you should be involved in who your children are exposed to. Much like co-parents approve/deny access to the kids seeing or meeting the other ex-partners new bf/gf, you, at the very least, should know that your kids are being exposed to another father figure of sorts. Even if it\u2019s a play date.\n\n\n3. Kids are more intuitive then given credit for. Kids can spot parents disconnectedness before they do and often try to intervene to keep the peace. That being said, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your kids are already aware of your partners proximal relationship to this new dude.\n\n\n4. Couples counselling. Just like a GP checkup for prevention, counselling works wonders. Seeing there\u2019s already been a breach of trust, your partner should put in effort to find one and suggest for you two to go. The initiative and execution to find one should be theirs if they care. Bring it up if you see fit. \n\n5. And lastly, stick to your boundaries. These types of issues can be non-issues but they can also blow over across a number of years where you\u2019re playing cat and mouse. The impacts of the latter are detrimental and really take a toll; let alone on your kids. This is your time to sit down with yourself, assess what\u2019s happened, how you feel and write down how you feel you\u2019ve been wronged and what it will take to repair that. At that point, you enforce that boundary and it\u2019s up to your partner to see it through. Any subsequent changes to that boundary will be met with resilience and a lack of respect for on her part. \n\nBest of luck OP. I hope you and your partner turn things around.",

Your wife took your kids and the neighbor took their kids on a trip to a kids museum that was educational for both sets. If your wife had gone with his wife, all you would think was that they shared babysitting on a fun activity for the kids. You're only concerned because of the genders.\n\nJust putting it out there, they might just genuinely be two friends who, owing to working from home, take on more of the childcare so bonded over that. There may be nothing more than there would be with a female friend.\n\nI'm not saying that is the case but I traditionally had more male friends than female and my husband was the other way around. It's random and means little and certainly doesn't affect our marriage. So I see that possibility here is all.\n\nGood luck and I hope it's my version and not the one everyone else believes!",

A lot of members have very hurt pasts. Those are real. What you don\u2019t get here are the spouses who are stifled and want legitimate friendship. Parenting is hard. Taking kids to museums is normal with other parents. I\u2019ve heard nothing scary in you original post.

All it'd do is make her feel like she's losing something valuable.\n\nInsecurity will destroy you slowly with time and if she's unwilling to realize it's destroying you it's time to start separating.\n\nShe went on a date with another man. Something similar happened to me and our relationship hasn't been the same since. It will never go back to before she met him and if you refuse to accept those emotions you'll repress them and your shadow will lash out at those around you.\n\nTake care of yourself OP!",

And this could be the case, up until its not; which is how most affairs begin. Do you want to live with the uncertainty of an affair blooming between them for the rest of your life? Can you have a happy life living with nagging doubt whenever your wife is at home in close proximity to this other man and you are at work? How long until you start going crazy whenever your wife exhibits strange or new behaviors, or is gone unexpectedly? My guess is that she really doesn't understand the toll that doubt can exact on any relationship, and that this doubt will continuously harm your relationship with her as long as she continues her \"friendship\" with this other man. It really is a fundamental choice. Is she your full-time committed wife or is she a part-time wife with a special relationship outside the marriage?\n\nJust tell her straight out that if she continues to befriend this other man, it will lessen your trust in her commitment to the relationship and that cannot be wished away. The price of her continuing that relationship outside the marriage is a weaker marriage and greater unhappiness for you and, most likely, your family as a whole.",

And no, you are not unreasonable to have these feelings. Setting boundaries like those you have set is more than reasonable. putting your wife on notice is essential. If you continued to bottle this up inside and not say anything you would be opening the door to greater pain. At least with her knowing how much this is hurting you and your relationship, you won't have to beat yourself up later if things go off the rails, telling yourself you should have done more to stop it. simply put, it is not the time you all spend together (kids and spouses) that you will be worrying about. It is the days when you are working and the kids are in school that are the problem and this will eat at your mind. If anything you may need more boundaries. Good luck.",

When people have been together a long time we have a tendency to take the relationship for granted. Take the other person for granted. Stop paying as much attention to them. Sometimes another person comes along and gives them attention. The attention they are missing. Just because she may be enjoying the attention she gets from this guy doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s going to cheat with him. Try touching her or flirting a little more. Like you did in the beginning of the relationship. Have more conversations and actually listen. Maybe you should try to get to know this guy and his wife and family.",

    "postText": "So, I'm currently on a year long relationship with my GF. Since day one we were pretty formal about it. Since we decided on a serious relationship, we presented our parents to each other. From my parents it was generally a smooth ride, but with hers, it was a little more difficult. They were particularly rude in some ways, but it wasn't something that I could really worry because my GF never was into their way of life or manners.\n\nUntil now \n\nRecently, my dog died, he was 10 years old and worst of all, it happened near her birthday. She planned with her family a party with all her friends and of course, me. They invited me, and my parents. My parents refused because they really don't want to have a party right now, because of the dog. I told her that I don't feel really well with doing party stuff like dancing but I could go and pretty much do everything else. She understood when I told her their reasons for not going.\n\nThe day of her birthday goes and I went to the party. It was really good and I had fun, even if I'm not a social person or anything like that. She had a great time but, it seems that her father didn't like stuff that I did, and stuff that I did not do.\n\nFirstly, I'm a musician, a pianist. I compose on my free time and one of the gifts I gave her was a composition of mine. It was a piano trio (piano, violin and cello) and it took me a long time to compose. She loved it. But her father later told her that as a musician I should have played her that piece on the birthday, and that means, bring a keyboard to her birthday and play a PIANO TRIO (I don't have any musician friends who play cello, and neither violins). My girlfriend justified this obviously with me not being able to play something like that alone and that it wasn't needed, but he dismissed her, and said that I have no excuse.\n\nSecond. Remember about my dog? Later, his father asked me when I was leaving why my parents didn't show up. I sincerely told him why and I thought that he understood their grief. Next day, my girlfriend says that my parents weren't being considerate about her, and that they gave more importance to a dog than his son girlfriend.\nMy girlfriend then tried to say something to him, but he told her \"don't compare yourself to a dog\". He also said the same thing about me for not dancing with my GF and, in general, not being a party enthusiast.\n\nThird. I stayed from 6PM to 12AM. I don't generally go outside for that long and late. My parents were ok with bringing me back to my house at 12AM, so I left the party on that hour. Today, my GF told me that her father was disappointed at me because I didn't stay longer and didn't try to help him doing management stuff before and after the party (which ended at 3AM...).\n\nThe point of all this is that her father doesn't want me in their house anymore. I was going tomorrow because I would help my GF with her studies for entering college. They don't want me there, neither her mom or dad. \n\nI really don't know what I did wrong. My GF is pretty much mad at her parents but can't do anything about it because they are very dismissive of her opinions on the matter. She was a little mad at me because I didn't take the initiative on those things, but later she apologized and said that she really can't do much (and I don't blame her. Her parents are really aggressive and shut her up when she tells them why she think they're wrong). I really don't know what to do. She has been one of the greatest human beings I know and I really don't want to end the relationship because of something like this.\n\nTL:DR; My GF parents are mad at me for not having that much fun as everyone on my GF party. I wasn't doing that because my dog died and I'm grieving him. They call me inconsiderate and my family gets called too for comparing her daughter to a dog. They don't let me see my GF anymore, even for important matters.",

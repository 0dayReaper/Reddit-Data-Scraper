    "postText": "This feels ridiculous because the answer in my eyes is \u201cno\u201d, but anyways: one of my best friends wanted to set me up with his cousin because we are pretty similar people. We started talking on Instagram after she added me (on my friend\u2019s advice to her) and had been doing so the last month and a half. It went really well as we have a lot in common, and I was going to ask her out but my friend said he planned this double date between us and his fianc\u00e9e. This girl was open to this and said she looked forward to meet in person. Well, their schedules never lined up to allow it but at this point, my friend and his fianc\u00e9e were about to get married and the girl (24f) would be at the wedding (this past weekend). I introduced myself in person to her and she was really short with me and didn\u2019t want to talk. After introducing myself she said \u201cOk\u201d and then i mentioned something about the music and she said \u201cAlright.\u201d I left her alone the rest of the night and was so confused why she was acting so different. My friend talked to her and she had been asked out by another guy at some point last week, and didn\u2019t want to lead me on (even though I feel like she could have just said that, I mean I didn\u2019t ask her to dance or anything). I know we haven\u2019t been dating and she doesn\u2019t owe me anything but it seemed odd she expressed a lot of interest and talked to me so much and then never mentioned this guy and blew me off. But whatever, I was disappointed but still moved on, until today when I found out she apparently decided not to take that guy up because she didn\u2019t like something he did (my friend told me this and he didn\u2019t know if I wanted to try again). So in theory I could ask her to still do something but after our initial, in-person reaction I\u2019m left kind of sour about it. So I don\u2019t know, do you guys think it\u2019s worth another shot with this girl? \n\nTLDR; Girl showed some interest me, acted quite on the contrary in-person, but now may be open to doing stuff again.",

            "comment": "If it were me, I\u2019d pass on her. She makes no sense at all. You guys talk for a month consistently and when you finally meet she\u2019s rude and brusque to you. Then says she didn\u2019t want to lead you on\u2026HOW you weren\u2019t even dating yet. She could have gave a simple polite conversation and still entertained the other guy as neither you nor him were actually with her at all. Honestly I feel like she\u2019s not as into you as you were into her especially after she saw you in person. I\u2019d pass. She\u2019s the type to reel you back in then do some other weird rude jacked up shit down the road.",

    "postText": "Original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bicdpm/my_friend_is_about_to_ask_his_girlfriend_to_marry/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)\n\nSo I got lots of feedback on what to do here. A good majority of the commenters told me to say something. To clarify, it may not have been clear in the op but I was never planning on doing nothing. Of course you gotta tell your bro if they\u2019re being cheated on. I just was not sure how to approach the situation. \n\nSome of the commenters gave me some very helpful advice. Some of you told me to talk to the girlfriend first, some of you told me to wait, some told me to gather a bunch of evidence first which I ended up getting from Alison, the third party friend. Some of you guys got angry with me for not telling him sooner, told me I was a bad friend. Some were sure he wouldn\u2019t believe me, some predicted the gf would deny it all. Well all of you were somewhat right. Here\u2019s how it went down: \n\nI messaged Alison early on in the day, shortly after I made the post because typing it all out brought my guilt and apprehension from the situation to the surface. I said to Alison that I needed to tell Aaron, and asked whether or not she had proof. This was when she sent me the screenshots of the text messages. \n\nAaron came over at around 8, and what was great was that Alison came over too. We all sat down and talked for a bit, and we all told him our suspicions about Mary. Alison showed him the text screenshots of Mary talking to her ex, and also told Aaron all the stories she shared about her sexual encounters. \n\nWhat was the most surprising was his reaction. He took it very well. He first got very quiet, and just nodded. Aaron ended up telling us that he had a sneaking suspicion that something was going on. He was not aware of the hookups, but he and Mary had gotten into fights before over the fact that she doesn\u2019t allow him near any other girls, but she goes out and flirts with other guys all the time. He told us that she had been distant lately, and would leave rather often without telling him where she was going. There were a few other small things he mentioned that told us he was just generally unhappy with his relationship. He knew in his gut something was wrong, but wanted to believe it wasn\u2019t true. \n\nWe started unwinding with some alcohol after that and it all got way more emotional. He cried, talking about how he felt stupid for not seeing it sooner, how he really loved her and would\u2019ve given her anything. Then he got angry. At her, and even more so at the guy. Some unpleasant and derogatory terms were used to describe her. \n\nUltimately he told us that he\u2019s going to be breaking it off at least for now. We told him a million times how much better he deserved. He\u2019s definitely not going to marry her. \n\nThanks again all for the supportive words and advice. We saved a good man from heartbreak!\n\nEdit: Jesus Christ this exploded fast. Thanks for all the kind words people \ud83d\ude05",

Keep by his side and make sure he has people stand up to her with him. The more help he can get through this. Also try and have him break things off over text or in public, Mary seems like the type to react very badly.",

Thankfully, my tolerance meter is quite low as it is so this only lasted 3 months. However, the psychological damage was already done and it took me years to fully come to terms with the situation.\n\nThe part that I am still not able to shake off is how there were plenty of \"friends\" around me at the time who just let me stay in that disaster relationship without ever once stepping in to tell me to wake up.\n\nI am forever grateful to the real friends who did exactly that (two of whom were groomsmen at my wedding).\n\nHere here for great friends who really care about their own!\n\nEDIT: I understand the logic behind being wary of my possible bad reaction to people calling out how the girlfriend was a bad person, but I still believe that true friends don't leave you to stay in your misery.",

In my case my ex had abusive, manipulative parents who made life hell for her... But guess what, growing up traumatized and with manipulative parents makes some people *really fucking good manipulators themselves*. A lot of victims go on to cause massive damage themselves.\n\nIn my case, if she hadn't started stealing from me at the end, in addition to everything else, I'm sure it would have been even harder to start to recover. Because as shitty as it was, at least it was something concrete and undeniable I could look at and say 'She *definitely* did some really wrong things and then hid it, I'm not making this up'.",

Glad to hear you're doing better and moving on, I've no doubt you can find someone wayyyy better. \n\nThat being said -- growing up with manipulative and abusive parents doesn't predestine a child to be an abuser themselves. While it is often the case, it's not a 100% thing, thankfully. I know some people with terrible parents who are wonderful and would never, ever do what their parents did to them -- and I know some other people like that with siblings that are awful. \n\nSo, YMMV. It's unfortunate whoever you were with was a POS, but really the blame falls on her.",

The problem for me is that it's taken me this long to admit to myself that that's how it was. I know for a fact she never cheated on me, but she was definitely manipulative. If she said something that hurt me and I brought it up to talk about, somehow she turned it around to be my fault and *I was the one apologising.*\n\nI want to move on and get over it, but I feel worthless after ten years of being told that I am. It's so bad that if I'm offered something I want, even as simple as something to drink when I'm visiting someone, I've convinced myself I don't deserve it, so I decline. The irony is *she* asked *me* for a divorce because I didn't want sex enough. I wanted it, but I felt like I wasn't worth it *because she told me so.*\n\nEven now I go through the list in my head of all the things I did to let her down. It's a long list. Damn I'm fuck up.",

It wasn't until he started acting very suspiciously that I went and checked his Facebook and everything else. He was very secretive with his phone. Kept changing the pin, hid his phone everytime he got a text, password protected his computer, etc, etc. So what your saying is only people that have cheated know how to look? So even though I only had suspicions albiet really strong supicions (that I was right about) I should have respected his privacy and let his cheating continue? Because he was not going to tell me the truth no matter what until I caught him at her house. If you were in the same position would you respect their privacy? And yes I did ask him stright up beforehand if anything was going on with this girl and of course he lied to my face and said no, that she was just a co-worker and friend one that he was not attracted to. I did that before I looked at his stuff.",

Like... levels of doubt at 0 basically due to how she was acting and how my ex before that acted the same way. Pretty sure I even heard her talking to someone in the background once when she was supposedly alone or whatever. Just a bunch of other shit too. Of course I checked her phone when she finally didn't have it on her and there it was. She still denied it of course.  \n  \nHer whole persona was based on this anti-cheating thing. Like, she could NEVER cheat because her mom ruined her life by cheating on her dad and having her illegitimate brother. Of course, I was a huge cheater and loved all my exes and blah blah blah because my ex-wifes (2 relationships and 10 years before) brother texted me to wish me a happy birthday and I stupidly told her it was him because I didn't think it mattered. So, she just used all this as a control method to cheat with impunity basically. Of course she would never cheat, so I'd never bother to check her phone right... Once I did, I only saw just enough before I was too disgusted to continue or even bother to gather proof (like it matters.. you should just be able to break up like normal right... nope, you need proof lol), but she was definitely cheating on me the entire time we were together and undoubtedly with many different people.

I've actually picked up my SO's phone, unlocked it (because we can both access each other's phone for convenience), and absent-mindedly opened a message from someone as if I'm just browsing reddit or something before stopping and realizing, oh wait, this is a text. I'm not going to read this, because it's hers and I don't need to be invading her privacy. \n\nI don't have any interest in monitoring shit like that, and she doesn't monitor me. We both easily could though, because we have nothing to hide from each other and can access each other's phones. It's just...not something we need to bother even thinking about because we trust each other. \n\nSo, I definitely agree. Find somebody you can trust. Whether you can actually access each other's shit isn't even important if you trust the person. We can because we use phones to look stuff up, play music, etc., but if I couldn't, I wouldn't really care. That's where you want to be in a relationship.",

When I broke up with her she cried about how I was the only one who had ever been faithful to her, how could she fix it, etc. But I think it was also a form of self-sabotage where she felt like she could reclaim control by ruining a relationship after she had been helpless in previous relationships.\n\nFortunately I am mature enough to not either go MGTOW or turn around and use that experience to justify future cheating behavior (i.e. \"I was cheated on, therefore all women cheat, therefore I'm going to cheat, too.\")\n\nBut I wonder how long this vicious cycle of people hurting each other because they've been hurt in the past has gone on for.",

I wouldn't dream of cheating on her as I love her to bits, genuinely.\n\nHowever due to me only having 2 previous LTR and both cheating on me, I do have barriers up and I do get jealous over silly things sometimes. Due to my girlfriends work (she worked in a bar) she had lots of males messaging her at stupid o'clock in the morning for free drinks/entry etc. Cos its what they all do where she lived as its expensive to live there.\n\nI get a lot more jealous than she does sometimes, but j respect and I just ask her about stuff and we're both cool about it. If she ever gets jealous, she can go through my phone whenever she wants, I've told her this explicitly. I'm at a stage of my life (as is she) where we're looking to settle down in life and mature in to our next stage. I've always been a firm believer in communication being key, and we're both very open with our phones. Neither of us do anything wrong, so what's the issue? It's not like we go snooping in each others phones or anything, but if she felt she needed to for whatever reason, be my guest!\n\nBasically... I can get jealous, and my girlfriend can get jealous too... But just cos someone gets jealous (and in my case I can get jealous semi-regularly) it doesn't mean they're cheating and/or pronecting. I've been hurt in the past and she understands that, it's part of the reason I love her",

Based on your OP where you mention that Aaron is in disbelief that she's still with him, it seems like he has obvious self-esteem issues and insecurities. What happened with this relationship may be crushing for him. It's good that he's doing the right thing to break it off, but the guy is probably really hurting inside, despite you saying that you saved him from heartbreak.\n\nI can't imagine what this may have done to his self-esteem and his existing insecurities. Men tend to show their feelings less. I would suggest therapy for him so he can grieve the loss of the relationship, and also process the feelings of how her actions had affected him, and even fed into his insecurities. I hope he's okay, develops healthy dating style, an eye for red flags, and finds someone who shows him he's worthy.",

Before I got help, I accused the guy who strangled me of wanting to fuck his sister. My husband (a practicing non-strangler) found me a therapy center that exclusively catered to anxiety disorders, and with rigorous intervention, my OCD barely registers on testing tools anymore. I no longer experience jealousy about exes, porn, hanging out solo with pretty girls, etc.\n\nSo it's kinda like Maybelline: Maybe she was born with it...

I have a really ugly past, so I think they always assumed deal with trauma = deal with OCD. Maybe that's true for some people, but for me, even though the OCD manifested from trauma, it had to be treated as a separate thing.\n\nI did an intensive combination of CBT and ERP 3x a week for a few hours, with daily hour long homework exercises in between sessions. I did this for probably 6 months or so, and then we slowly scaled back. \n\nERP is somewhat controversial. You have to be EXTREMELY dedicated. I would have quit 10x over if my husband hadn't taken the reigns and rigorously kept me on schedule and in attendance. Mind you, he found me this place because I broke down and told him that I wasn't depressed; I didn't want to die; but OCD was forcing my hand and I was going to have to die soon. Still, when I was in therapy, that sometimes seemed preferable. One time during an exposure session we accidentally pushed too hard and I ended up in a dissociative state for a few hours. I still remember seeing and hearing everyone through a literal tunnel.\n\nWhen I was going, I hated all of them. I felt traumatized and ganged up on. But when it was all over, and as I continued my recovery over the years, I realized that they truly saved my life, and I am so grateful. I don't even understand how I survived that long, honestly. I always said the only moment I knew peace was those first few seconds of the day, when you first wake up and don't yet remember who you are or what your problems are. I lived like that for a decade. It's wild.",

Then he went out with an old girlfriend until 6 am the next night and when she voiced het concerns he would say \"I didn't do anything whatever\" and stomp off. I'm pretty sure he cheated. My dad is a lunatic though. Gotta love double standards. But he didn't just project on her but everyone. Some people just don't know any other healthy coping mechanisms. They truly believe the crap they're spewing. And blaming someone else makes them feel like they did no wrong and takes the pressure off of them. People be crazy.",

Fuck all the people telling you that you're a bad friend for not telling him sooner. If you hadn't gathered your thoughts before hand, then you may not have had the help and proof you needed to tell him. \n\nFor the record to anyone out there: Do NOT talk to the person who is cheating before you talk to the SO being cheated on. All that does is give them time to gameplan. Especially in a situation like this where the guy is being manipulated and abused, that is a path that will likely lead to more pain and suffering.",

Even though he suspected something was fishy, he loves her and will probably be tempted to rugsweep the issues if she says enough of the things he wants to hear.\n\nHe may need a strong support system for the near future.",

I found, far too often, that too much blame is put on the person cheated with. I have a friend - Let's call him Jay - who found out his wife of two years was cheating. He was furious and rightfully so. A lot of details sort of match up to your story: She was controlling, he was dependent on her, etc. After he calmed down a bit, he coldly said how he couldn't believe that someone would go after a married woman. I was taken aback a bit. Almost all of the blame, in Jay's eyes, was on the guy she was hooking up with instead of his wife. I understand being mad at both parties, but it's a dangerous road to go down when all of the anger is focused on the other person.",

It goes along with the derogatory language that was used.  \n\nIf something were to actually come of it in a way that affects anyone outside of that room, then it would be bad. But in a safe place with two friends and some alcohol to blame for the tears, there's nothing wrong with letting loose and allowing yourself to be irrational and angry and sad until you're finally able to come to grips with what is going on in your life. In fact, I would say it's much healthier than pretending like you AREN'T having these thoughts and feelings, because you definitely are even if you feel guilty about them.",

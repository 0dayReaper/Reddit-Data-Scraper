    "postText": "Hello everyone, I'm in need of some advice. I have been facing a difficult situation involving an ex-boyfriend from about three years ago, and I could really use your insights and suggestions.\n\nTo provide some background, my ex is one of those individuals who doesn't seem to take \"no\" for an answer. Despite being broken up for 3 years now, he continued to send me messages throughout this whole time in an attempt to stay relevant in my life. I have made a conscious effort to cut off all contact with him, including not responding to his texts or accepting friend requests. The breakup itself was quite rough on me including how he treated me afterwards. (The relationship itself was only 4 months)\n\nFast forward to the present, I've been a part of a small, close-knit hobby club for about a year now. These individuals have become my only friends, and I can honestly say that I'm for the first time happy in my life because of the club and the meaningful connections I've made. However, an unfortunate turn of events has occurred \u2013 my ex has recently discovered this club through an old school friend and has decided to join.\n\nNaturally, I'm feeling extremely uncomfortable with this situation. I strongly dislike the idea of having to see him regularly or be in the same space as him. It has reached a point where I'm considering not attending the club meetings when he's present, or worse, leaving the club altogether. I've tried pleading with him, explaining how important this club and my newfound friendships are to me, but he seems to be intentionally disregarding my pleas and refuses to leave.\n\nWhile my friends at the club empathize with my situation and understand how I feel, they believe it would be unfair to deny someone the opportunity to join. I'm caught in a dilemma because I don't want to abandon the club, but I simply can't bear the thought of my ex infiltrating my inner circle.\n\nI would sincerely appreciate any advice or suggestions you may have regarding this predicament. How can I navigate this situation without compromising my happiness and the positive experiences I've found within this club? Thank you all in advance for your help.",

I would absolutely deny entry to someone who has been making my friend's life miserable for 3 years over a 4 month relationship and expect them to do the same for me. Also... block this guy. Don't just not respond. File for a restraining order. Guys like this tend to escalate their behavior until something truly awful happens. This is likely one of many steps in escalated behavior that could end with your death. Take it seriously.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m (21f) writing this here for advice. I really need advice because this is ruining my life. For example, let\u2019s say my boyfriend (23m) went to the grocery store. At home I will watch him on Life360 drive to the store, if the car slows down or he stops at a light a little too long I wonder if he either got in a car crash or is being robbed at gunpoint at the stoplight. When he isn\u2019t answering I keep watching my phone imagining a relative of his calls me telling me he\u2019s dead. When I\u2019m alone at home and he\u2019s out I imagine the police knocking on the door to tell me he\u2019s dead. When he\u2019s busy and won\u2019t text back I check the local news website to see if any deaths have been reported on. When he\u2019s asleep and won\u2019t pick up the phone I imagine he died in his sleep. When he\u2019s outside getting something from his car I\u2019m afraid someone will just walk up and shoot him. I don\u2019t just imagine him dying in every way possible but the aftermath too. I have never lost anyone, I have never been cheated on, I don\u2019t feel this way with friends/family, etc. have no idea why I am constantly thinking like this. Even if I tell my mind to stop, everyone has their time to die, enjoy the moment you have with him now because you can\u2019t control death and you don\u2019t want this to ruin your relationship, my anxiety convinces me it\u2019s best to imagine every possible outcome and that stressing about it can possibly stop it from happening. Any tips on this? I hide this very well so he doesn\u2019t know how much it affects me and I don\u2019t like talking to him about it because I\u2019m always afraid I\u2019ll somehow jinx it. He knows about it though and tries to reassure me he won\u2019t die but my anxiety just goes you never know, don\u2019t believe him. I\u2019m begging please does anyone have any advice? I\u2019m going crazy. The only time I\u2019m not thinking this way is if I\u2019m distracted or thinking of/doing something else. I also think I\u2019ve developed an attachment disorder without him so that\u2019s great too..",

            "comment": "So I am going to actually give advice. I'm not licensed or anything but this is actually very, very common for postpartum anxiety where you get intrusive thoughts that the worst will happen to you or your loved ones. A few things help - \n\nFirst, minimize the anxiety inducing thing by not feeding into it. For me, that mean that I had to stop looking for those scary/sad but improbable news stories. For you, it might mean you have to stop tracking your boyfriend. \n\nSecond, understand what you can and cannot control. Anxiety, despite it bad rep, is actually a good thing - it keeps you from doing dangerous things and keeps you safe. When you get anxious that your boyfriend isn't wearing his seatbelt while driving or a helmet while biking, you can encourage him to wear them, but you can't control anything else. If it's beyond something you can prevent, then you have to stop the intrusive thought. \n\nThird, give positive reinforcement when the bad thing doesn't happen. I'm terrified of flying, but I fly a lot for work. What I used to do was worry about everything bad that could happen while flying but I realized that it was all beyond my control. Instead, when I land safely or if the flight is smooth or whatever, I go \"what a smooth ride that was\" or \"the pilot handled that turbulence perfectly.\" Little by little, I no longer fear flying the same way because I've created positive reinforcement about the fearful activity.\n\nLastly, seek help. Staying present and learning from mistake and listening to reasonable anxiety can be learned in therapy, so I suggest you try it. Even though others haven't said it, it kind of makes sense - you love your boyfriend a lot and care for him. Just make sure your fears and love for him stay healthy and not obsessive (which this very well can turn into).",

Because as much as you think about what \u201cifs\u201d for him, can\u2019t those situations be flipped and you be the victim those situations can happen to you. Then what? You really gonna lose him for good. So stop. You\u2019re bringing so much negativity into a relationship you want. You are developing a victim mentality and that\u2019s no way to live in peace. Put everything in God\u2019s hands, right? He gave you a great man to be with. Then have faith. Remember this everything happens for a reason. Don\u2019t live by the future and in fear; live by the now and in joy. Thank God every day you got to go to sleep and wake up together. Look at him and hug him.

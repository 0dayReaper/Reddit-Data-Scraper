    "postText": "So... We had an argument about something not even that important, then it goes as usual, she starts to scream, smash things and I keep my cool as I am alredy used on that. After she goes and tries to attack me, so I grab her wrist and tell her to stop it (with normal voice, I never scream). Then she pushes more and more and more and I have to use more and more force to be able to keep her under control. Things got out of hand and she got her back on a couch, where she started to kick me randomly, I withstand few kicks but then one landed in my face, directly on my chin,this was way too much and I slapped her on the face. Not too strong,just so she can wake up somehow. Then she stopped. I explained to her that she is in no position to be able to hurt me, she has no right to kick me in the face. She was surprised I slapped her because I never did in the past even when she was smashing my head against a bathroom tiles in the past - I always try to keep my cool, because she is bipolar and she does not even remember these episodes, but hey, this time I could not hold back anymore I felt hurt and I wanted to stop her... Slap was not big, but still I feel like an idiot for not trying harder to stop her somehow with clothes or something... she then went to the kitchen,took a lamp, smashed it on the ground and screamed a lot... I get what you might thinking \"get rid of her\" but I try to separate the illness from person, because I love her, real her who is just hurt by world and people, not this abusive monster that came in place as natural protection.... Anyway.. my question is if I failed because I promised myself to never hit a woman in my life but I did.How can I solve this situation and what are your thoughts on this?",

If she cared about you she'd put at least as much effort into controlling her reactions around you as she does at work.\n\nIf she isn't able to hold down a job, then you need to ask yourself if you want to keep trying to save this woman who very clearly doesn't want to save herself by finding a way to vent outside of harming the person she claims to love.\n\nSure she might be great sometimes, but she could very easily land you in court for assault or rape, even if you didn't do it. All she would need to do is injure you, call the cops, and tell them it was self defense for X reason. The police always believe the first person who calls them (this is talking from personal experience with being assaulted).\n\nTrust me dude, I know how hard it can be to strike out on your own, especially when you will be hurting the person you love. You feel like you'll be breaking their already injured heart and causing them irreparable damage. I've been there. But the truth is that you will be giving her back power over herself. By removing yourself as an object of emotion she can latch onto she will have to learn to live with herself, and regain the ability to stand strong on her own herself. It's the only way she will improve herself and her life, and you destroying your own life to stay as her excuse for not bettering herself in a meaningful way is not going to help her, it's just going to hurt you. And how long before this other side of her tries to injure you permanently in your sleep or something.\n\nYou leaving is the best chance at her being able to gain the strength to work on herself, because right now you are her excuse not to. Don't put yourself and her through that any longer, break it off mate. Before she spirals down even further and you or her get seriously hurt.\n\nTLDR: You may care about her, but the person that comes out during an episode is not the woman you want to be with, they are the shitty \"best friend\" that third wheels everywhere and keeps dragging her down. You leaving is the best chance at her being able to gain the strength to work on herself, because right now you are her excuse not to. Don't put yourself and her through that any longer, break it off mate. Before she spirals down even further and you or her get seriously hurt.",

One night she was screaming, threatening suicide if i left to go for a walk, grabbing things from my hands and throwing them across the room. Unplugging my computer if I tried to to ignore her when she was having an episode. She was in my face screaming at me and kept pushing me into the wall behind me, I for one second lost my cool and pushed her up against the wall and put my hand on her neck, it lasted all of a split second because as soon as i pushed her I freaked out thinking i was horrible. For the last few years I've carried with me that I'm an abusive ex and she has told me the reason she couldnt trust me anymore is because she's afraid I could do that again in the future. Even though she worked through her stuff and we were together for a few years after that, she told me she never got over that night. Never before or after have i ever laid hands on anyone. And yet i have to convince myself I'm not an abusive POS for that. Remind yourself that having a stress response to being abused and attacked does NOT mean you are abusive. But I would suggest getting out of that situation as you will convince yourself you deserve to be treated that way, and I promise that you do not.",

I really think you need to look at getting some help for yourself. You need a therapist to get away from that thinking. \n\nI would suggest getting some pictures and seeing a doctor. I would not be a fan of calling the cops. In most instances they blame the guy and the wife is allowed free. There was a incident of a cop arresting a guy while the wife was chasing him with a knife.  There was also the guy that his wife beat him so much that he was missing part of his ear etc., but that was in England.\n\nI would not stick around for this - sure she is sweet and lovely while taking her meds etc., but if she quits. . . .just get away from it. its the prince charming effect in reverse for an abuser.",

It is possible to live with bipolar and not be violent but she needs to learn to cope with her emotions. There is so much help out there for bipolar treatment and therapy. She should be admitted to a psychiatric hospital to get on the right medication and stabilize so she can live life safely.\n\nI could go into a long spiel about how her mental illness isn't an excuse for her to abuse you but I know it won't mean much coming from me. You deserve better. Please do some research on how mental illness doesn't cause abusive behavior. Lundy Bancroft wrote an awesome book about what causes abuse and how to tell the difference between mental illness and abuse. \n\nSource: I'm a long term psychiatric patient diagnosed with Cluster B Personality disorders and have a long history of being a domestic violence victim.",

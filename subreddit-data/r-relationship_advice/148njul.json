    "postText": "For some context my bf has autism and I know that\u2019s why he tends to talk to me/act the way that he does. \nWe\u2019ve been together for 3.5 years and living together for the last 2, and since I first moved in he has been telling me that we do not spend enough time together, but I\u2019m confused and resentful, because I feel like we\u2019re together all the time? \nWe are both on disability and unable to work, and my bf has chronic pain and I\u2019ve got mental illnesses (and probably narcolepsy, as we are just now figuring out), and we agreed before I moved in that I would handle all the meal prep/grocery shopping. \nSo every day I get up at 6, do chores around the house, take a walk, then by 7:30-8 I\u2019m showered and ready for my day to really start. I usually hang out with my bf whenever I\u2019m not cooking our meals, like from around 8:30-10:30, then from 11:30-3/4ish, then in the evenings we usually hang out together. A few times a week I have to take a nap during the day because I most likely have a sleeping disorder, and this makes him angry every time because it\u2019s taking away from \u2018us\u2019 time. \nI will go through phases where I paint a lot and I will spend my nights in my office working, and this also apparently annoys him.\nIdk. I\u2019m just not sure how reasonable he\u2019s being or if I\u2019m totally off-base in thinking we spend plenty of time together. \nThoughts? Thank you in advance for any responses.",

Even like a few minutes a few days a week is enough to establish a presence in smaller groups. There are also probably zoom or other online meetup groups somewhere around where you live. \"Attending\" with him could be a way to help ease him into it. Do you have friends or family that might come to the house to hang out? For me even talking to my therapist is fulfilling socially lol. Does he pursue hobbies of his own? I wonder if he's lonely, bored, unfulfilled, or all three.",

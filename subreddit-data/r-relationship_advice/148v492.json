    "postText": "so backstory: we were together for 4 years and he broke up with me because he was struggling financially, didn\u2019t believe in marriage or being together forever even after taking me out to look at engagement rings, was in a depressive state, and was confused sexually like wanted to get with fem boys. I thought this was our last breakup because it really seemed he didn\u2019t want me anymore. He even followed new girls and fem boys after a couple days after our breakup. I blocked him on everything except his number. I cried so much wanting him back even though I felt he didn\u2019t want me. \n\nFast forward to last weekend where I took a trip across the states from Boston to Texas to see a close friend who I met in college. His family paid for my tickets because they wanted to see me and treat me to things since I\u2019ve been keeping their son\u2019s stuff in storage in Boston. Anyways I ended up doing stuff with him. The first night I got really drunk and had sex with him. The second night I slept with him. No sex just sleeping. Then third night I had sex with him out of being horny. However I felt like shit both times because I thought about my ex and I didn\u2019t even cum both times. I felt numb the whole time. However the whole time we were aware we were only just going to be friends. We talked a couple days before the trip and during the trip that a relationship could never work because our mental healths are bad and we didn\u2019t want to lose each other if we were to go out and get broken up. \n\n\nSo after this weekend a day later my ex calls me. He apologizes for everything and says he\u2019s trying to be a better person and really wants to make it up to me. He\u2019s been trying to be more positive and wants me to be part of his future. He even saved up over a $1000 to put towards a car deposit. Also if forgive him we could start being friends and build a relationship slowly. He wants to take me out on dates until he surprises me to ask me out for real in a special way. Plus give me surprise gifts and plan out special dates. I asked him about the sexual things and he said he\u2019s sorry the sexual confusion got between our relationship and the time apart made him realize he\u2019s straight and he\u2019s only attracted to women. And how should i know if he\u2019s actually changed? He said I would have to see him and see how much he\u2019s grown to be less negative. He said more sappy stuff but in the end i said a part of me wants to go back to him but a bigger part of me doesn\u2019t because I don\u2019t want to get hurt again. I told him i would think about / put it off for two weeks until summer school ends. \n\nand after the call I called my friend from Texas. This was a bad decision Ik. The man was crying so much and i felt so bad to hurt him. He said he knows we have to stop being so close to each other physically but doesn\u2019t want to. I said regardless if i go back to my ex we should stop sex and sleeping together. Also he said he doesn\u2019t want me to go back with my ex cuz we won\u2019t be as close anymore but also does so he can get over me easier and since I still love my ex. \n\nIn the end idk what to do. I still love my ex but idk if it\u2019s right for me to get back with him. Ik the two weeks will be helpful but idk if it\u2019s enough time",

I wouldn't jump back into the relationship with him. I personally wouldn't have sex with him till I was certain about him having changed enough for me to want to get back together...\n\nBut honestly if you are tired, you don't have to go find out if he's changed or not. There is such a thing as it's too late and your not a bad person if you feel like your just done regardless.",

Did he really come back for you? Or did he see other people, get bored, and come running back to you? What about that \u201cdidn\u2019t believe in marriage or being together forever\u201d part? That\u2019s still there, isn\u2019t it?\n\nEdit: a month and a half seems really short in the grand scheme of things. You sure he\u2019s who you need him to be? Do you really wanna waste more time to see?\n\npro - you love him\nCons - all the issues you mentioned before might be there",

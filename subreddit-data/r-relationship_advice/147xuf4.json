    "postText": "My (25f) boyfriend (28M) says my boundary of not wanting to be with someone who goes to strip clubs is controlling. I\u2019ve explained to him several times that my ex of 3 years had multiple relations with several strippers, and as such it is a hard limit. He said he is grown man, and he can do whatever he wants and doesn\u2019t have to follow the rules of someone else. I said I agree, you\u2019re absolutely allowed to do whatever you want, but I won\u2019t be in a relationship with someone who cannot put my feelings over seeing another woman naked/getting a lap dance. I told him this before things even got serious with us, and he said he didn\u2019t want to go to one anyways, so it was fine and he understood. Now all of a sudden, I\u2019m trying to control him. I don\u2019t think I am. I never said \u201cyou\u2019re not allowed to go to a strip club,\u201d I said it was a boundary of mine, and if it is something he feels he needs to do, then we can just go our separate ways. It wasn\u2019t even a threat, because we weren\u2019t even serious. He brought it up a few days ago, that he wants to go for his friend\u2019s birthday. I reminded him of my boundary, that he agreed to because we became exclusive, and he told me that his boundary was not to be with someone who controls him. \n\nI said \u201cI\u2019m not trying to control you, but if that\u2019s a boundary for you, that\u2019s fine and we can end things now. My boundary will not change.\u201d He replied that he doesn\u2019t want to end things. And I just reiterated that he can\u2019t go to a strip club and also have me. It\u2019s just a hard boundary I don\u2019t foresee myself ever going back on. I feel like he is trying to push me to throw my boundary out the window, but I know for a fact I won\u2019t feel good about it. We\u2019ve only been together for 6 months, so at this point I really think it would just be less of a headache of cut things off. I care about him, but I\u2019m not interested in being a \u201ccool\u201d girlfriend who pretends I\u2019m totally fine with something I find extremely disrespectful. He thinks I\u2019m being irrational, I think it\u2019s kind of messed up he is trying to push against something, again, I warned him about before agreeing to be his girlfriend. Thoughts?\n\nTLDR: Boyfriend wants to go to a strip club against my hard boundary, but doesn\u2019t want to break up to do so, and says I just shouldn\u2019t be controlling.\n\n\n\n!!UPDATE!!\n\nI got sick of commenting the same thing over and over again. He came over, we spoke and he said he was definitely 100% going, a private room was booked, he was getting lap dances, and I\u2019d just have to be okay with it. I told him I was not okay with it, and if he really wanted to go I wouldn\u2019t stop him, but I also wouldn\u2019t continue the relationship with him. He knew I considered it cheating, and was basically asking my permission to cheat on me. I broke up with him in the end, he called me crazy (something he know is a trigger), and left. About an hour after the break up he was calling and texting me. His texts flip flopped between \u201cyou\u2019re being crazy\u201d to \u201cI love you please talk to me baby\u201d. And then eventually I was a \u201ccrazy bitch\u201d. \n\nAround 4:30 am, he used my hidden key to enter my apartment, and I was woken up to him crawling into my bed and crying that he didn\u2019t think I\u2019d actually dump him. Crazy, he knew from the beginning, agreed to the boundary, and expected me to just drop it since we had an emotional attachment? Not happening. \n\nThen, a few hours later he texted me about how it was all made up because he wanted to see my reaction. There is no strip club party, he just wanted to see how I\u2019d react if it ever came up in the future. He wasn\u2019t expecting me to actually break up with him. This wasn\u2019t any better than there actually being a strip party in my opinion. This might actually be worse. He wanted to see how far he could push my boundary, to see if I\u2019d let him cross it. Although I\u2019m not sure I believe him anyways, he said it\u2019s a regular bar party, and I\u2019m invited but why wait hours and after a breakup to admit it? Maybe it\u2019s crazy to assume he spoke to his friend and asked him to cover for him with a \u201cregular party,\u201d and then go to the strip party in secret. But it\u2019s also freaking crazy to make up something just to see if you can get your girlfriend to sacrifice her feelings for your fun. \n\nEither way, I won\u2019t be getting back with him, ever. This was an eye opening experience. My locks are getting changed by maintenance today, and his number is being blocked. I\u2019m too old be playing these middle school games. \n\nAs for the comments that said I was punishing my bf for the actions of my ex, wrong. I\u2019ve never ever been okay with this. I\u2019ve always considered naked women rubbing their tits and ass on you to be cheating regardless of where it takes place. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s normalized by tv, movies, etc. It is not something I am willing to ever tolerate in a partner. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s seen as controlling either. If you think saying \u201cI won\u2019t tolerate being cheated on, I will leave\u201d is controlling, that\u2019s you. And it\u2019s also why I said it before we entered a relationship. It\u2019s why I worded it \u201chey, I can tell things are getting serious, before we are exclusive I think going to strip clubs and getting lap dances are cheating. If your ideals don\u2019t align, that\u2019s fine, I won\u2019t try to control you, we just don\u2019t need to pursue a relationship. It\u2019s a boundary I won\u2019t ever cross\u201d He said he was fine with it, they\u2019re stupid, he doesn\u2019t want to go.\n\nHe also said male strip clubs are different because male strippers will sleep with women customers for free, but you have to pay for female strippers to do that and he isn\u2019t that type of guy.",

So we went a lot. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nStrip clubs lost their muster after that, though. I mean, honestly, the strippers were doing a job, and they were good at it. We enjoyed the performance, much like going to see acrobats, naked acrobats, but imma tell you right now that those girls had skills!\n\nIn our state now, we have to pay for alcohol at a strip club, and the girls didn't have the same acrobat performance as the ones we had in college. No, thank you.\n\nETA: OP my strip club boundary with my bf, while different from yours, doesn't make me, \"the cool gf\" its just different. My boyfriend and I have some weird ass boundaries (he hates wet hair so I clean the shower drain...I have a foot phobia so we wear socks at home like 95% of the time). \n\nYour bf could be young/immature, but honestly the only guys I have ever met that feel the NEED to go to strip clubs either can't get laid on their own OR think very little of women. My bf enjoyed the strip club bc it was time we spent together. \n\nYou're being kind and fair. Personally, I would leave just bc he's already trying to turn it around on you and make you the bad guy.

Good on you for sticking to your boundaries, enforcing them correctly and viewing things accurately.\n\nWhen he tries to get back with you, just remember his plan all along - ignore your boundary, hope you back down, and if you don't try and get back with you after breaking that boundary.",

Put it to him like this: \u201cSo, would you have a problem if I danced naked on another guy?\u201d Watch him -freak- and exclaim all sorts of hypocritical reasons why that\u2019s \u201cDiFfErEnT!!!\u201d Respond: \u201cHow is it different? There\u2019s no penetration as you say is the case with your strippers. It\u2019S jUsT nUdItY! The real difference is YOU are experiencing the pleasure and you think respecting me and observing appropriate boundaries shouldn\u2019t apply to you. Society has tried to make strip clubs socially acceptable and women sticking up for themselves and having boundaries as not acceptable. Men try to keep us in check by making us out to be \u201cthat girl\u201d if we have a problem with strip clubs. I\u2019m not taking the bait and falling into that trap. If there\u2019s nothing wrong with women rubbing their naked bodies on you, then there\u2019s nothing wrong with rubbing my naked body on plenty of other men. You can\u2019t have it both ways. And that doesn\u2019t even consider the financial aspect of what you\u2019re PAYING these women when that money could go towards taking me, your girlfriend, to dinner or buying me flowers or gifts. You\u2019re giving these other women money to take off their clothes for you. How is that a healthy thing to be doing in a committed relationship?\u201d",

If you are making your partner feel uncomftorable, then you should care about that. Not try to rationalize that behavior and make them feel like they are one being inconsiderate.\n\nI swear, the quality of people and morals have just gone to trash.\n\nDump his entilited ass",

If he decides to go, make sure you're not there when he gets home.\n\nBut in general, don't give anyone a shot who has an issue with your boundaries. Especially when your boundary isn't an unreasonable one. You shouldn't have to fight with him about it. He initially accepted the boundary and now has an issue with it. This will continue to be a problem, I promise. If he considers you asking for basic respect of you and your comfort over this, he's going to do it with any boundary you set because really he wants to do what he wants, when, and with who he wants with zero consequence. Which...is fine. But he can't expect that in any relationship he's in. \n\nLet him go to the club and just bounce while he's gone",

As women, we often feel like we don't have the right to, like we should be \"cool\". Screw that. \n\nWe have a lot to offer and we should be shown the same respect that is expected from us. \n\nIf our partners can't see that, it's their loss.

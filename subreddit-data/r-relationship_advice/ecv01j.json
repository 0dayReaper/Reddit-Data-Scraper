    "postText": "My parents are going away for Christmas, so before they did they hosted an early Christmas party at their home, which my whole family went to including me my husband and our 16 year old daughter Laura.\n\nMy sister and her daughter Rachel were there too. She's a year older than Laura and they don't get along. In fact we try to avoid them as much as we can due to amount of times that Rachel has upset and tormented Laura. Rachel is naturally very smart and is always top of her class, and is also very pretty. While I've always been happy for her and wished her the best, these things have constantly been used to excuse her. My sister even went as far as to accuse Laura of lying because she is jealous of Rachel's looks and talents.\n\nLaura took up boxing last year and has progressed really well. She's going to compete at a higher level next year and her coach is extremely proud of her. My sister has insisted that the boxing is nothing more than ''a phase'' and has gone out of her way to downplay it in favour of her daughter's academic stuff.\n\nAt my parents place Laura went to sort out some presents under the tree, and Rachel followed her. She was wearing stiletto high heels, and when Laura had her hand on the floor Rachel stamped on it. She was in agony.\n\nWe went to the hospital, and after a follow up visit to the doctor today Laura needs extensive physio, and will not be able to box for an indefinite period. She's in floods of tears because of this.\n\nI was raging at my sister, who is so deluded that she insists that it was an accident. I'm sorry, but after years of calling Laura ugly, stupid, fat and anything else she could think of do you really expect me to believe that this was an innocent mistake? Rachel for her part put on the crocodile tears for everyone, and only her parents believed it.\n\nMy husband wants to tell the police and I do too. I warned my sister about this, and she broke down crying too, saying that her daughter's teachers have encouraged her to apply to the top universities because they think she's got a good chance of getting in, and that if she ends up with a criminal record then that will be ruined.\n\nNo sympathy from me. Frankly Rachel took something that my daughter loves away from her and left her in huge amounts of pain. She shouldn't just have her chances ruined, she should get locked up.\n\nI know it sounds awful of me but she did an awful thing and needs to face the consequences. Laura is utterly heartbroken and Rachels parents won't punish her.",

Obviously OP will never be convinced otherwise. To me it seems far fetched that a teenager was so jealous of her younger cousins boxing success?? when she is already successful that she would try to go full mafia and break her hand purposely.",

The cops aren't going to do shit, they're not going to pull the one girl into an interrogation room and grill her and force her to admit to the crime of stepping on her cousin's hand.\n\nIt's fucked up, but unless you've got like.. video evidence (and even then it'd have to be clear as hell it was a direct stomp, not a mis-step) or a straight up confession, the cops are really not going to be able to do much.\n\nAnd while OP might be sure that it was intentional because of the history between them, these accidents *can* legitimately happen, and you've got to prove to a jury beyond a shadow of a doubt that it wasn't an accident.\n\nThe best solution IMO is for OP to get those people out of her life, involving the courts will likely do nothing unless she's the type of person to just confess - if the cops even bother asking her.\n\nIn six hours OP hasn't answered any questions or posted again. We don't know who saw it, we don't know if it was the entire room and there are multiple witnesses willing to say \"She intentionally and forcefully stomped on her hand\" (if so you might have a civil suit possible?) or not, or if nobody was looking, or they were alone, etc. Was anybody recording a video? There's really no information other than just OP asserting it *must* have been intentional because of the history between the two, and you can't convict on a supposition.",

Especially if the cousin has no priors and does excel in school, no one is touching this. The assumption will be accidental and frankly, police deal with violent, in the moment domestic violence daily. They won't take a report days later with any seriousness, a lot more immediate problems.\n\nReally the OP just needs to protect her family and just cut off the sister and niece. This has been on going bullying and the sister doesn't want to be a parent. Trying to get the police involved will just polarize the family and ultimately alienate the OP and her family from the rest when nothing comes from the police and her sister and niece play victim and how it was an accident and they apologized, etc, etc. It'll just be further frustration with no satisfaction.",

For example if R kicked L in the head.  These cases are hard to prosecute, they would prefer that families reconcile instead of go to war so you'd really have to push for charges to be laid.  Lastly, family often will refuse to testify years down the road at trial. \n\nFile anyways because at the very least it will be an incident report that will come out when she sets fire to someone's dorm room or accidentally poisons someone.",

What is wrong with you?\n2. You sound jealous as fuck about Rachel. You spent multiple paragraphs complaining about her. Let me provide a piece of advice when you speak to anyone else about this - you leave most of that shit out. It's not only fairly irrelevant, it just makes you look petty.\n3. The police won't do anything unless you have some evidence that this was an intentional act. Otherwise, Rachel's parents will just say \"Laura put her hand on the floor and while trying to help Rachel accidentally stepped on it\". You have no proof that the hand was stepped on purpose and intent is required for criminal charges of battery. No DA is going to prosecute a minor for unintentionally stepping on someone's hand in their own home. So if you want to report it because it makes you feel better, go ahead - but you are literally wasting your breath if you do.\n4. So your best course of action is to sue them in civil court for the medical bills/pain and suffering. That's easily proven and provides compensation for the injury. Because the cause of the injury is not in dispute, it's a very easy case. And it should have the secondary effect of making sure you never associate with them again, which YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE BEFORE IF YOU WEREN'T A SHITTY PARENT.\n\nAs for Rachel, you have to figure either she'll go to far and get hers one day or she'll grow up. But this isn't going to be that time.",

What would be satisfying restitution for you?\n\nThe police will do nothing. Realistically, they'll try to bully your daughter out of making a statement. They'll call her names, accuse her of making false accusations and abusing police resources for mom emergency matters (which, yeah) etc. Your family will look at you as if you're massively overreacting and taking a family issue outside the family. All in all, you will be the one ostracized, not her.\n\nAnd for what? She won't end up paying your medical bills, she won't end up with anything on her record that will detrimental to her in any real way. You will face consequences for this, not her.\n\nSo again, while I'm sympathetic to you the other commenters here have some very rosy opinions about how the police would handle this situation that frankly isn't very realistic. I don't know that a better option exists, but going to the police in a non emergency situation 90% backfires on the victim.",

Nothing about this story adds up from a total outsider's perspective that this wasn't a complete accident.  I can't pretend to know what actually happened, I'm just saying that if I get your account above and the account of your sister/Rachel that completely contradict it, all I have is she said she said, and an injured hand.  It's unfortunate, but I can't see anything happening here. \n\nIf you'd like some advice it would be that if this truly happened, you should avoid these people moving forward and worry about your life and your daughter's, and how to improve both of those.",

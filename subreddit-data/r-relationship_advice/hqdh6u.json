    "postText": "Original post: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hmuoa5/my_fianc%C3%A9_26f_and_i_27m_decided_to_break_up_but/)\n\nAlthough I didn't get to reply to any of the comments except for one, I made sure to read all of them in my main account, so I would like to thank everyone for their great advices. Here I am now, excited to tell what happened in the course of 5 days.\n\nSo the day after posting that, nothing really happened. I spent that day reflecting on what kind of future I see and want with her. I also thought a lot about the past; how we messed it up, how we both got too lost in our jobs... etc. In my original post, I asked if what I'm feeling could be just an infatuation that would go as quickly as I came. But I realized that my feelings for her never really disappeared to begin with. It's like my heart just went in a deep sleep and I forgot how much feelings I carry for her.\n\nI think some of you may know (and have pointed out) that I'm not really good at communicating my feelings. I tend to keep things to myself, and my fianc\u00e9 is one of the few people who can be patient with that. Some suggested to write a letter instead, or a note, or marry her in sims... I ended up with drafts of sappy letters that I ended up scraping and a sad attempt to recreate us in the sims. But still, I wanted to make an effort to show her what I couldn't say through words. \n\nI've heard about her wanting a few DLCs in the sims in the past, so I had the idea to buy a few for her (sims' DLCs are pretty expensive especially in our currency..). Surprised her by stealing her laptop for a few hours and once I gave it back to her, she was elated and so happy. It was really nice seeing her get so excited over it. We played together that whole day and tried to solve the mystery in Strangerville (a game pack in the sims). It was so fun.\n\nThe next day, I found her in the kitchen trying to bake something. It was a blueberry cheesecake recipe she saw on youtube. I basically became her cooking assistant that day, helping her as much as I could and we ended up with a pretty decent outcome that I bet would've tasted better if I hadn't messed up so much. She still said she had so much fun and loved the cheesecake though.\n\nThe next day, which is just yesterday, something important happened. We were basically just snuggled up on the couch playing when our sims just autonomously \"tried for baby\" in the bed. It was hilarious and we initially laughed about it but then we got pretty silent. She then closed her laptop and hugged me tightly then, without saying anything. I think that was my realization that \"oh, she feels the same as I do..\" so I knew I had to speak up. I'm still impressed at myself for managing to talk yesterday without choking up, basically opening up the conversation like \"are you planning to go to your parents soon?\" and she said no, she doesn't feel like it yet. I asked her why, she told me she wanted to stay. I told her I wanted her to stay too. We went to sleep that night just huddled together. And even though we didn't really explicitly say it, I think we're now aware of each other's feelings and it feels like a really huge improvement to me.\n\nEarlier we ate breakfast together. We weren't as chatty as we've been the last few months but the silence was comforting. We also watched \"Knives Out\" together. We haven't had \\*the\\* conversation yet, but I'm going to bring it up to her tonight. I'm really glad this whole ordeal went much nicer than I expected it would and I'm relieved I didn't let my doubts get the best of me. Though I still have to get better with how I communicate things, I'm going to learn for her. \n\nThank you to everyone who left nice comments in my original post. I apologize again if there are any mistakes in my post, I'm not a native english speaker nor am I from the USA. \n\nTL;DR: We both feel the same towards each other. We're yet to have the \"talk\" but I know now, without a doubt, that she still loves me, too.\n\nEdit: last update in my comment https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hqdh6u/comment/fxy0mgg Thanks everyone!",

            "comment": "Okay hi. I posted this thinking the same people who saw my last post would respond, and seeing that a few users wanted an update back then, I thought what the hell, why not give them a little update right now and leave it at that. Now I have 5x more the audience I had the last time... \n\nRight now my fianc\u00e9 is sleeping next to me. Yes we had the talk. As soon as I posted this, I logged out and gathered myself so I can tell her what's been in my mind for months. It's not really something so 'exciting'. We basically just sat down together and talked about what went wrong before. I told her the things I said in my last post, and she admitted to worrying about what happens after the lockdown gets fully lifted too. We both acknowledged that we worked too hard to become financially stable so that we can get married. Right now though, all we could do is promise and talk about how we're going to manage our time better, since we have no idea if our country is ever going to return to normal (the curve is not getting flattened at all and the quarantine is about to get extended again). And then we talked about our feelings. I got to tell her I love her again, for the first time in years probably, and she told me the same. After that it was back to a lighter conversation, we basically just bonded until she fell asleep.\n\nI honestly thought only a handful of people would see my post. I made sure to use reddit because this isn't really a big platform in our country and I was sure she wouldn't see this post, but now that there are like 20k upvotes as I'm typing this, I think she might stumble upon this post sooner or later... Well then, I know she's going to be whining a lot about this but she'd be glad to know that a lot of people found our relationship \"wholesome\".\n\nThank you all for the kind comments. I know some people are thinking \"why haven't you just talked to her in the first place\" but getting some perspective from other people really did help give a push. I think if I left myself alone with the thoughts I was having, things would've gone a lot worse, so I'm really grateful. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the awards I received since this is just a throwaway account though, but it's still cool. I'll try to answer as many questions as I can and then log out.\n\nThank you again :)",

That must have been horrible Grandad. We were learning about that at school this week.\n\nThey told us about how all the schools had closed. And mum's and dads  couldn't go to work so didn't have as much money to do nice things.  They said that you weren't allowed to go and visit your friends and  family and couldn't go out anywhere. They told us that the shops ran out  of lots of things so you didn't have much bread, and flour, and toilet  roll 'child giggles'. They said that summer holidays were cancelled. And  they told us about all those thousands of people that got very poorly  and who died. They explained about the NHS and how hard all the doctors  and nurses and all NHS workers worked, and that lots of them died too.\n\nThat must have been so horrible Grandad.\n\n**Grandad** \\- Well kid, that is all correct. And I know  that because I read about it when I was older. But to tell you the truth  I remember it differently...\n\nI remember playing in the garden for hours with mum and dad and  having picnics outside and lots of bbq's. I remember making things with  my Dad and baking with my Mum. I remember making dens with my little  brother and teaching him how to do hand stands and back flips. I  remember having quality time with my family. I remember mum's favorite  words becoming 'Hey, I've got an idea...' Rather than 'Maybe later or  tomorrow i'm a bit busy'. I remember making our own bread and pastry. I  remember having film night 3 or 4 times a week instead of just one.\n\nIt was a horrible time for lots of people you are right. But I remember it differently.\n\n\\---\n\nCOVID has given us time, and I hope people appreciate the little things in their life more now.",

It's the daily interactions and the little things in your relationship that matter the most, and not the grand gestures. The small talks, joking arounds, watching movies or a tv episode together. All these little things strengthen the bond between you and her. \n\nAs opposed to if you decide to only focus on your job during the week and to go to a fancy restaurant during the weekend, or go to a long vacation once a year to make up for the lack of attention you've given each other. At that point, you would've been falling out of love with each other. And the time when you decide to spend together, the restaurants &amp; the vacations, would have felt more like you were spending them with stranger rather than the love of your life. And that would also further push you both apart.\n\nI wish you both the best of luck!",

OP, check out 5 love languages, but also look into couples therapy. It's not just a resource for when things go sour, it's a great tool to help you improve your relationship and help you both be prepared for when you might find yourselves on the same path that drove you apart, for example. I highly recommend it. But even if you're not interested in looking into that option, you HAVE to learn to properly communicate. Without the ability to do it regularly, honestly, and in a healthy way, it's very hard to build a healthy relationship. I wish you two all the best!",

There are times like this in every long term relationship, when you just aren't feeling the same level of connection and love for each other. It could be because you're too busy or because you have some kind of significant trial that gets in the way. You can avoid some of these barriers but not all of them. You have to agree to stay together through some lows, knowing that your relationship has the strength to come back. You have to be deliberate about making ways to build your connection and show love for each other. You have to agree to be kind to each other, to always see each other as beautiful human beings, even when you don't feel the same level of connection. If you can do that, you have the capacity to have a beautiful, rewarding, long term relationship. Wishing you the best!",

Thank the other person for stuff\u2014if my husband loads the dishwasher I\u2019ll tell him thanks since I know he really hates doing it. Or he\u2019ll thank me for doing the laundry (it\u2019s nice just hearing that you\u2019re appreciated). We make time to hold hands &amp; cuddle and just *be* there for each other after a busy day. We\u2019ve had our ups &amp; downs like every couple but we went into our marriage fully expecting to spend our lives together. We\u2019ve had stupid &amp; silly arguments but always make a point to sit down and find a compromise. Don\u2019t go to bed angry either it just causes heartburn &amp; heartache. Better to discuss and work through it. Then you can have great make-up sex rather than stew in your disagreement. I wish you guys many happy years ahead!!",

It sounds silly, but people give love and feel loved in so many different ways, and if you\u2019re trying to love your partner and they\u2019re not understanding/ noticing it, it can be devastating to a relationship. \n\nMy husbands love language has ALWAYS been physical touch. Not even sexually, but hugs, hand holding, even just having my foot touch his leg or something has always been very important to him. I, however, was never quite sure what my love language was. I\u2019d had a string of bad relationships and it seemed to change to whatever I wasn\u2019t getting at the time. I\u2019ve been with my husband for almost 6 years now, and in having a healthy relationship I was able to realize my love language is \u201cacts of service.\u201d Once it was brought up in a fight about me being frustrated about chores or bills or something stupid, my husband starting doing stuff for me ALL THE TIME. He already did, but he kicked it into overdrive and it has just made me so so happy. I forgot we had talked about it and after like a week I commented on how amazing he had been, and he was like \u201cWell yeah, I finally figured out how to show you I love you!\u201d It was awesome.",

If it\u2019s more emotional seething, it\u2019s *still abusive behavior* and you deserve to feel safe in your relationship.\n\n&gt; Shutting down communication. They\u2019ll ignore your attempts at conversation in person, by text, or by phone.\n\n&gt; Dismissiveness. You tell them about something that\u2019s important to you and they say it\u2019s nothing. Body language like eye-rolling, smirking, headshaking, and sighing help convey the same message.\n\n&gt; Dehumanizing you. They\u2019ll look away when you\u2019re talking or stare at something else when they speak to you. *\n\n&gt; Tuning you out.

I just wouldn\u2019t. Like when someone wants to be with me, I assume they\u2019ll be brave enough to put themselves on the line and tell me that. I\u2019ll do the same. Marrying in sims is cute, but only using that as a hint when you\u2019ve agreed to break up is not cute, if you ask me. \n\nI bet she\u2019d also appreciate you doing that for a change too.

When you have kids, have issues with money, want other things in life (a new job, maybe to move, etc) you\u2019ll need to communicate rather than drop hints and hope the other party \u201chears\u201d you.\n\nPlease restart your lovely relationship, and then pretty pretty please make it a point to learn how to talk to each other!

We spend so much time trying to provide financially that we haven\u2019t been able to provide emotionally.\n\n2. A lot of work can actually be done from home. And because of this, the office grind is no longer necessary. \n\nI read both posts of yours and it seems to me that work, success, and financial stability is what killed your relationship, and working from home along with some \u201ccouple time\u201d has brought it back to life.\n\nI\u2019m not sure of what career paths you and her have, but maybe consider something that you and her can be a part of? I think you 2 need each other and your souls are attached to each other.",

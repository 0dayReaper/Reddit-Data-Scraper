    "postText": "This\u2026 is complicated hahaha. Strap in for a looong and messy story. Let\u2019s start by introducing the important people in this story so it doesn\u2019t get confusing. Let\u2019s preface this by saying we are all fairly young (18-19-20). I am also very against cheating, it\u2019s a value I have, I think it\u2019s horrible for the partner you cheat on and can destroy someone\u2019s trust for all the other relationships after. \n\nMy bf and I have been together for 3 years. He has a best friend, let\u2019s call him Tom. They\u2019ve known each other since birth and are basically family. So Tom has a girlfriend of 2 years, let\u2019s call her Katy. Well over those two years I became friends with Katy since both of our bf are really close. Let\u2019s just start by saying Katy and Tom are not the best communicators, within their couple I mean.\n\nWell for the past 6 months every time I\u2019d see her she\u2019d complain about her boyfriend, mostly sexually. She\u2019d say how he\u2019s childish and often says wrong things cuz he feels awkward and blablabla. I\u2019d try to help her, give her advice etc. I\u2019d also tell her to talk to HIM about her needs and stuff because he probably can\u2019t read her mind. She did express that she wanted more adventurous experiences, and that she thought he could be kinda boring sometimes, but how \u201cshe\u2019d never cheat on him cuz she could never do that to him she loves him too much\u201d (very important cuz she told me this every time the topic of seeing other people and having new adventures was brought up)\n\nA few months ago, we went out as a bigger group (Tom and Katy included) for my birthday. There, Katy met a friend of my bf, let\u2019s call him David. Well during the night, she told me she thought he was hot and how if she was single she\u2019d get with him. (My bf and I learned that he felt the same way after, just for context). Anyway, she\u2019s the type to flirt with people just for fun, she like to make eyes at people and stuff, and she even flirts with me\u2026platonically? (Like I know there\u2019s nothing going on between us, and it\u2019s more a friendship thing). \n\nAt another party, she and David ended up taking care of another guy in the friend group that puked all night, so they basically spent the evening with him in the bathroom, taking care of this other guy. Apparently they hit it off, she asked for his snap. They started snapping and have been for 2-3 months now.  Well at the beginningDavid called my bf to tell him how she was so flirty and how he knew she was in a relationship but she was sending signals and stuff. Me, being concerned I questioned her and she let me know that it was strictly platonic and even if she found him attractive nothing would happen cuz she loved Tom so much. Well during those few months they started texting more and more and David started driving to her house picking her up and then driving around and talking for hours. Obviously Tom started to feel insecure, but she reiterated multiple times that he was just a friend and bla-bla-bla. \n\nRecently Katy was feeling confused about her feelings for Tom, so they took a week long break so she could sort everything out in her head. The thing is, it was made clear between them that they didn\u2019t want the other to go see elsewhere, it was more of a take a bit of distance thing see how I feel etc. Well after the week was over she was still feeling confused. I asked her if anything happened with David she said no. So they asked us come over and help them if we could, give them advice. My bf and I spent a whole freaking afternoon helping them, giving them tips for their communication, telling them stuff that worked for us and all. After a bit of crying from almost everyone in the car, they seemed on the right track and kissed for the first time since the break. \n\nThat night, we went home and David came over to have a look at our car (he\u2019s a mechanic) and when we told him what we had been doing all day, he became upset and told us that Katy and him kissed multiple time s in the last two weeks. \n\nHe told me he had cut her off the day before because Katy\u2019s mom actually warned him about her daughter and how she had done this in every single one of her relationships (new infos for me) (basically she cheated on her first boyfriend and emotionally cheated on her second boyfriend at the end of their 3 . relationship with Tom) I was furious. Furious and so sad for Tom, who was so over the top in love with this girl he would do anything for her, after she scolded him for being jealous and for checking her phone and how he didn\u2019t trust her (now I know he had reason to). Also David felt so mad because he felt like they we moving towards something more and felt betrayed when her mom told him what she did. \n\nApparently the first cheating moment was a short kiss between them a week before the break. There was and full on make jour sesh on Friday the day before the end of their break, and a small make out the Saturday morning. David told us that there were more times in between as well. \n\nWell my bf and I knew that we had to tell Tom. So we called him and told him. We thought he would leave her but he ended up confronting her and trying to talk it out trying to process it all. He ultimately forgave her I guess. I think she kinda manipulated the truth a little to make it not seem as bad. She also told him that it was a mistake and it made her realize she loved him. Like really? It took you 3-4 make out with someone else to realize you loved your boyfriend, or is it because you realized how desperate he was to have you back and how the one week hurt him? \n\nWell it hasn\u2019t even been a week and now she wants to come to our move (she wasn\u2019t originally supposed to come because it\u2019s her birthday weekend), there will already be David and Tom during the move (this weekend) and it don\u2019t want it to be even more wierd. Im also still mad at her and my bf is too, for putting everyone around her in a roller coaster of emotions, even tho Tom forgave her I guess. I feel like I just need time and it\u2019s not like she\u2019s going to be useful during the move anyway, she has a back injury. Apparently she cancelled her birthday plans cuz she reaaaally wants to support us suddenly and be there for us. Am I a bitch for not wanting her around for a bit at least?",

            "comment": "Well.. she's been lying and cheating Tom. And lying to close friends in the process of doing so.\nThe only reason that made her apologize and step back is the fact that she got caught (or snitched on by her mother, to be more accurate).\n\nFrom what you said, it seems that there is no grudge held between Tom and David, as they both will be there for your move. \nSo the best would be to uninvite her, first with the motive that she won't be of that much help due to her back injury. And in case she would be insisting too much.. by reminding her that she caused pain in 4 persons and that you don't want any kind of drama during this day.\nHer answer should give you the lead of your friendship. Either she feels remorse, for hurting you all. Or she'll make you feel bad for not having here around (using bargain, pity or anger to get what she wants).\n\nAt the end of the day, the real question you have to ask yourselves is \"Do I want to let this person hurt me over and over ?\"",

    "postText": "Hey there, it has reached a point where I find myself turning to internet strangers for someone to talk to. So here it goes...  \nI'm an 18-year-old guy who has developed romantic feelings for my best friend, who recently decided to transition from female to male. Despite the transition, my feelings remain unchanged. It's the first time I've ever experienced something like this. We've been best friends for over two years now, and we just finished 12th grade. I've tried everything to explain away or suppress these feelings, but nothing has worked :(  \nNow it's time for us to apply to colleges. We both want to pursue engineering based on our own interests. I've been trying my best to outperform him in most tests so that we can get into the same college. However, there have been a couple of exams where he outperformed me by a significant margin, and now I'm worried I won't get into those colleges. I really want the opportunity to talk to him about this, but I've chickened out or encountered unforeseen circumstances on two occasions. Now I lack confidence in myself to ask him out :(  \nNow I am in a different city and constantly think about him and miss him a lot. I feel like I'm not good enough, and I've gained weight and other things like that. So, I've been putting this off until I can get myself in better shape. But at the same time, I want closure, and I want my first and only chance to count. Should I go through with this? If so, should I do it before we go to college or wait until I feel good enough? Should I do it in person, over a voice call, or text?  \nThis situation has also influenced my college decisions, and I'm torn between what's best for my career and what I want emotionally. I'm stuck in a dilemma :(  \nTL;DR: I'm an 18-year-old guy who has developed romantic feelings for my best friend, who recently decided to transition from female to male. Despite the transition, my feelings remain unchanged. As we apply to colleges, I worry about not getting into certain ones where he outperformed me in exams. I want to talk to him about my feelings, but I lack confidence and have chickened out before. I also feel insecure about myself and wonder if I should wait until I feel better about myself to pursue this. It's causing me to question whether I should communicate in person, over a call, or through text. This situation has also affected my college decisions, and I'm torn between what's best for my career and my emotions. I'm stuck in a dilemma.",

Most teenage relationships don't last so don't plan your future based on one.\n\nDon't bother waiting until you feel good enough, you'll likely lose your chance. I'd tell him in person, say \"hey this is a little awkward but I've got a crush on you. do you have any interest in me?\". If it goes badly, you get to run away to college.",

    "postText": "Ten days ago I requested advice and the post got removed after a day because I didn't use a ThrowRA.  I'm reposting it below, along with an update, since some people asked for one. I alerted the moderators I would be doing this, so hopefully it will allowed.\n\nORIGINAL\n\nI received an email last week from a woman claiming we are a DNA match and she is my biological daughter. It was a long and emotionally charged letter. She said she knew she was child of rape, and while she had no desire to form a relationship with me, she wanted me to know that she existed and to understand the pain and anguish I had caused her and her mother and grandparents. The letter was gut wrenching.\n\nI was shocked but also skeptical. I have been married 25 years and I have three great kids. I have never raped or abused a woman ever! I thought this had to be a prank or scam. I had done home DNA ancestry testing two years ago, and it had not shown a child I wasn't aware of. But when I logged into my account, there she was.\n\nI did some sleuthing and figured out that her mother was a woman, Terry (fake name), I had dated for about a month during our first semester of college in the mid-1980s.  We broke it off mutually and remained friendly. The very last night of the second semester, we hooked up at a dorm party and went to my room and had sex. It was a casual hookup and I remember it as 100% consensual and very passionate. Also unprotected. Afterwards we went back to the party and had a great time dancing and mingling with friends. We both went home the next morning for summer break. Terry didn't come back to college the next year, which I gave very little thought to since we weren't close and hadn't bothered to communicate all summer. \n\nOne of the reasons Terry and I were incompatible was religion. She was Catholic and I'm Jewish. I was not religious but she had grown up in a strict household. My supposition is that when she discovered the pregnancy, she told her family she had been raped rather than admitting to premarital sex with a Jewish ex-boyfriend. But who knows, maybe she had other reasons. \n\nIt kills me that I have a daughter in her 30s who has been fed lies about her father. I can't imagine growing up thinking I was a product of rape. That has to be so hard psychologically. I am in pain for a child I didn't even know existed just a few days ago, and who hates me.\n\nI have been debating what to do. I have not written back to my daughter. I badly want to tell her the truth, in a way that she can believe (but how?). My wife, who has been a rock the last few days, keeps telling me to give this some time and thought. My best friend says I should hire a lawyer. I don't know what to do and it's eating me up. Advice, please!\n\nUPDATE\n\nI hired a lawyer. He recommended that I respond to my daughter's email to unequivocally deny the rape allegation. I wrote her a short message and described how and when Terry and I met. I was careful not to attack Terry and to offer sympathy. I explained that our sex was consensual. A week went by with no response.\n\nTwo days ago my daughter wrote me and said Terry now claims she was raped a month after she and I had sex, and that she was told by her doctors that the baby was born premature 8 months later. She's basically saying she was misled by her doctors. I find that very hard to believe, but if it's true it is awful and if it's not I guess it gives Terry a way out without exposing her big lie which is maybe best for everyone.\n\nYesterday I spoke to my daughter for the first time. She was crying and so was I, so it wasn't easy to say much. Before we hung up, I told her that I loved her because she's my flesh and blood, and I hoped we could get to know each other and meet my grandchild. She sobbed so much after that, and said she's been waiting her whole life to hear those words.\n\nMy wife and I told our kids about a week ago. They are teenagers and took it really well. All three are interested in meeting their new sister and niece. My wife....my beautiful, caring, bestest friend ever....she's been nothing but supportive. She has offered that we invite my daughter and granddaughter to visit over the Christmas holidays, even suggesting we pay the airfare and offer them our guest room. My daughter is going to call me again tonight and I'm going to propose she come, or offer to fly to her if she's more comfortable. We have a lifetime of catching up to do.\n\nMeantime as for Terry, I feel like my daughter and I were robbed, but I really don't want to dwell on it. She hasn't reached out to me and I don't plan to either, though I'm prepared to be cordial if she does, and to listen to her story and be open minded.\n\n\nEDIT:  I'm overwhelmed by all the love coming at me from Reddit. Thank you all for your support, compliments and helpful opinions. Really, really.\nI promise I will post an update!\nSilver and Gold! Feels like I'm Burl Ives. Thanks, kind strangers.",

This is a situation that seems like something straight out of a movie, and I cannot imagine the kind of stress and anxiety and sadness and everything you have been feeling as a result of it. I'm really pleased to hear that things are turning out well with those who matter the most: your spouse and your children, despite the awful lies of another person. I wish you all the best!\n\nEdit: and your grandkid! How could I forget the grandkid.",

Or if she stays, send the kids to the cinema/mall/sleepover etc just for the first day so just the adults &amp; grandchild can get to know each other.\n\nI'm an introvert and staying with a family I'd never met would be way too much for me, even if I was keen to meet them. I'd just want my own space to unwind, and where I could leave early to have a quick \"lie down\" if things become overwhelming.\n\nI really hope this works out for you OP, and that you can come to terms with that Terry did to you. I have to say, I think you've handled everything so far with remarkable equanimity and grace.",

It relates to what you wrote.  I married young, and my wife had \"been with\" someone before me.  In fact, 2 someones, and in both cases, it was rape.  At the time I thought, \"How horrible and unlucky can one person be?!?!\"  I felt terrible for her.  Raped multiple times, by 2 different men -- both of whom were supposedly sweet &amp; innocent boyfriends in the Christian church.  Yet their ugly sides came out and they forced this Christian girl to participate in very un-Christian behavior.  Supposedly.\n\nYou can probably see where this is going.\n\nWhen my wife and I divorced, one of her parting shots was, \"You know, by the way, that you're a rapist.\"  I had never heard that before, so I froze.  I let the accusation hang in the air for a second.  Then I asked her to explain herself.  \"Every time we ever had sex, it was rape.\"  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  We had a 20 year marriage, full of love, laughter, and 2 beautiful children.  She was going to retcon the entire thing to be non-consensual the whole time, even our wedding night?  She's going to re-cast the whole thing as she never loved me, never liked me, always hated me and was somehow *forced?*  For 20 years?\n\nI said this to her, in slightly different words.  I was incredulous.  And she had a calm \"that's a fact, jack\" expression on her face.  \"Yes, everything was rape, all of it, even when it seemed like I liked it, because you always knew I was a people-pleaser, and you used that knowledge against me.  You asked me to marry you knowing that I couldn't say no.  But I was disgusted by you and didn't want to marry you, and you knew it.  Then you initiated sex, because you knew that my desire to be considered the nice person would mean that I would never say no.  You knew that too, and used me sexually for 20 years, you abuser!\"\n\nIt turns out, I did *not* know any of that.  If it was true, my whole adult life was a lie.  But I knew it to be false.  She had initiated sex *constantly.*  But as she and I argued about it, I started to pull back.  I started to let her have her delusional thinking.  Why?  Because she was so angry, so full of bile, that she couldn't see who this hurt the most: our kids.  She was retroactively dooming our kids to be children of rape.  She wanted to change their life story from something beautiful to something ugly.  Why?  To hurt me.\n\nBut it didn't.  It just made me sad for her.  And our kids.\n\nIt turns out she has never had an ex that didn't rape her.  Everyone she breaks up with is a rapist.  That's how she classifies all her old relationships.  I think it's a coping mechanism, because her parents are elders in her church and she desperately wants their approval.  If they viewed her as sleeping around, they would ex-communicate her.  It helps that she's angry and this solution not only keeps her in good stead with her mom &amp; dad, but also allows her to intimately wound her exes.\n\nI have made it a point to remind my kids that I love them, and that they are very much wanted.",

My mother never wanted to talk about him and would get upset when he was brought up, which was rare. All I had was story about man that wanted nothing to do with my mom or myself after she told him she was pregnant and a tiny photo with his name on the back. \n\nWell, I lost the photo temporarily during several moves but my grandmother somehow found it and when she gave it to me I looked on Facebook and there he was. It took me almost an entire year to work up the courage to contact him, fully expecting to get rejected based off what I had been told in the past. \n\nAfter the death of someone I cared deeply for I realized I was wasting precious time and sent him an email and waited for the bomb to go off. He was thrilled and we talked and talked for days. I finally asked him what the fuck happened and why he wasn\u2019t around. Well as it turns out my mom left out some information, go figure. My mom and him had a causal relationship and she moved on to my brothers dad right after. So when she wound up pregnant he wasn\u2019t sure if he was the father and wanted a paternity test. My mom dropped it and they went their separate ways. \n\nI spent my whole life thinking I was an unwanted burden that my dad couldn\u2019t be bothered to look us up. I felt robbed, I was robbed, so was my father. You two were robbed too. You\u2019ll never get that time back. But you have to focus on the present and put your energy into building a relationship. Her mom and my mom have to live with the truth. The truth has a way of catching up with people.",

As having sex out of wedlock is seen as a huge no-no to a lot of religious parents.

However, I later discovered that every ex she ever had \"raped her\". Then I found out I was on that list after catching her in a friend's bed. He told me I had raped her and she needed somewhere safe, and that he's not a pig like me, and they didn't fuck. Sorry, but when he's supplying dope, she's unemployed, and they're hiding that they talk (after I told her to stay away from him cause he's a sociopathic addict now, which I didn't know when I introduced them, he'd told me he was clean and just down on his luck so I helped him out and they \" hit it off\") and then find her in his bed? Later she told another mutual friend that my \"friend\" raped her too. Some women really do lie about it for stupid reasons. Sympathy, religion, sole custody, convenience really, or endless other stupid reasons. Most people I know wouldn't dream of mocking rape but I know two people as well that do irl. It's pathetic. She actually almost got a guy fired saying he assaulted her at work to cover up just being unfaithful, and after flashing my neighbor, said he attacked her, but I saw the whole thing, and there was no attack by neighbor, just her being mad and vindictively doing it when she thought I wasn't looking. Funny thing, neighbor told me about what I witnessed unbeknownst to either of them, and when I confronted her she claimed assault. Also, she kissed the guy at work, not the other way around, according to a female and male witness. \n\nJust own the fact you cheat or have casual sex. Don't ruin friendships, families, jobs, or lives of other people for your lack of self control.",

I suppose I see what you're saying, but I don't believe the doctors would have blindly gone along with it. 1. They would have been talking to the mom not the family if the mom didn't want her there and dr patient confidentiality. That said, even if the doctors did go along with it it would've been something to the effect of : this baby is actually 5 months along \"no it's not the first time I had sex was 4 months ago when I was raped\" but-- \"nope that was the first time\" ok i guess it's 4 months. The doctors wouldn't have never said the words \"your due date is actually (somewhere in the correct range) and the mother would have realized. She may have kept up the charade, but she likely was told and just denied it and maybe they relented, sure. I'm sure the doctors never told her she was lying, but I don't for a second believe they NEVER told her the child was in fact conceived around when she was actually conceived. If the mom willfully ignored this because she didn't want to accept her consensual sex could result in her being pregnant and would rather believe it was a rape baby, that's plain ignorance on her part. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, age of the fetus is in part determined by size, and maybe even mostly at first, but later on it's mostly about gonadal, lung, and nervous system development. While our advances have made it so we can determine diseases and malformations through ultrasound that didn't exist in the 80s, age of fetus was a rudimentary development. Anyway, signing off now! I have to study. If you're more interested in it you should do some research. I find ultrasound pretty interesting and we can always benefit from learning new things!",

The court would require a chain of custody of the dna sample and the testing and the testing would have to be done by a machine certified by the relevant governmental agency recognized by your state.\n\nTests like Ancestry and 23 and Me are reliable enough for this setting. As someone else pointed out - you randomly get matched with a daughter that is the exact age to be your child from a relationship with a woman you had relations with. And as you said - she has your family's nose.  The odds of her not being your child are astronomically high.\n\nThere really is no need for a legally recognized paternity test unless child support were at issue.  But, if your daughter wants a court recognized one -then agree to it.  Otherwise  - enjoy that you have another child and now a grandchild.  Congrats.\n\nSource - I am a lawyer, but I am not giving legal advice and statistically speaking I am probably not licensed in your state.  Your lawyer is right if this was a court setting and child support was on the table.",

You'd think she'd see the results and remember that this wasn't the guy who raped her, but in fact someone she hooked up with years prior. Either way the past is the past, and I understand wanting to move past it in favor of forming a relationship with your \"new\" kid. If the version of events above is true, then I pity your ex for thinking she was raising the product of her rape.

If the Mom didn't lie, then it must be such a relief to her that her daughter is not a child of rape which has caused both of them such anguish over the last 30 years.

There is no way for anyone to know except for the mother -- regardless of how improbable you may think the story is -- and it's in no way OPs place to correct the mothers story. If she was saying *he* raped her that would be one thing, but what good does it do for anyone for OP to play cynic and tell his new daughter he thinks her mom is a liar? She is an adult and can look at the timeline / series of events for herself and come to her own conclusion.\n\nOP already stated there may have been significant religious reasons why she created a lie in order to deal with her own parents. Is she then obligated to tell her daughter that the story she maintained to her own parents was a lie?",

Please correct me if I'm wrong based on the post but to me it doesn't suggest the daughter has mentioned the DNA test to her mom before reaching out to OP. If she's only brought it up to mom because she's found this new information and then mom could have been surprised by the information. She's told her daughter what's happened but she might not want anything to do with OP (for now) because she's re-processing trauma with this new information. \n\nI'm not saying that Terry lied or didn't lie, but the way these events have unfolded don't really suggest either way to me. In the case of her being raped and believing it was the rapist's bio child then these events would have played out the same way as the lie.",

We thought maybe they were having money problems or closing their business, and didn't think much of it other than some mild curiosity. They sat us down and told us both that we had another brother. It was a total shocker for us - my parents had always been totally normal people and we would never have suspected anything like that. \n\nTurns out my father (who is eleven years older than my mother and met her when he was 30) had a brief relationship as a senior in high school that resulted in a child. The girl had once introduced him to the child when he was about six months old, and then told my dad that she didn't want him involved in the child's life at all. \n\nOver the years, he had called to check in on him a few times, but was still told not to get involved. Finally, after more than a decade of not speaking to her, he calls and this time she invites him into his life (keep in mind at this point my brother is about 38 years old, but my father still wanted her approval). My brother, who is about fifteen years older than me, had three kids ages 15, 10, and 4. He welcomed my dad into their lives, and ever since then he has treated them like family with regular visits, family vacations, Christmas and birthday gifts, etc. \n\nTo me, he feels more like a cousin than a brother because I didn't really grow up with him, but it's great to have more family and I'm glad he happily accepted my dad into his life.",

            "comment": "Hello! I hate you've found yourself in this predicament but I'm grateful there was resolve. You aren't alone! My mother did not put a name for a biological father on my birth certificate. She came home from upstate and told her parents she was pregnant and that she had been raped but wanted to keep the baby. She met my (step)dad when I was 2. This man raised me and is the only dad I know (I will refer to him as dad)! It wasn't until I was 11 that I even found out he *wasn't* my biological father. What 11 year old looks at their birth certificate ?? My parents (mom and dad) divorced when I was 3 but my mom had twins by my dad so he stayed in active in my life. Crazy shit happened and later down the road about 10 we moved in with our dad. Mom yelled across a restaurant one night that I wasnt even his daughter (she was mad bc my grandfather was giving him custody). That **sucked** but it was okay. My dad consoled me and said he'd help me find my biological father if I wanted him to, so we looked. My mom gave us the name of someome who my dad reached out to. The guy said everything added up, my birthdat and he remembered my mom, and we did a DNA test. Poor fella, wasn't him and he had his hopes up. I was more upset that my mom and given us a false name. Later in my life (18yo) my mom told me she knew who my bio father was but refused to tell me, a couple years later explaining it was a date rape. Fast forward to my early 20s and she says esentially she was getting it on with anyone and everyone and would I like her to put up a billboard asking who slept with her the summer of '95 to get the answers I wanted. I realized everything before was a lie bc she didn't want to be forthcoming. I'll be 24 in January and I still don't know who my biological father is. My dad passed away early this year and I have no desire to uproot an unknown grown man's life and form a relationship with him. I simply want his medical history. Wouldn't turn him away if he wanted me in his life as I'm a friendly person, but I don't think I'll ever get what your daughter will. Cheers to you and your incredible wife. And best wishes.",

            "comment": "Aww this sounds like a good outcome. I am glad you get to get to know your daughter. Dont expect too much and be very open and communicate clearly because feelings on both parts can easily get hurt because its a very emotion filled time. I hope you get to have a fantastic relationship in time.",

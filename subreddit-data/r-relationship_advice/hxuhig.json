    "postText": "Original post:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hu9xlv/my_22m_vegan_girlfriend_21f_wants_me_to_get_rid/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share\n\n**TL;DR** My gf is a passionate vegan and wants me to get rid of my beloved cat because cats eat meat and kill mice.\n\nFirst of all, let me say thank you for everyone who offered advice. There are over 7,000 comments on my original post and I have dozens of PMs. Frankly I'm still pretty overwhelmed with the magnitude of the response. I did my best to read most everyone's comments but obviously I couldn't get to everything!\n\nI would also like to preempt this post by saying, as many users pointed out, that my GFs extreme views on domestic cats are not representative of the vegan/vegetarian community as a whole. I do think that, sometimes, new vegans can be a little overzealous. In reality, most of us are just doing the best that we can to not hurt animals! I did not expect to generate a big debate in the comments.\n\nSo, we broke up, obviously. I would never, ever give up my cat Mittens. Many users said that this situation was about control, not veganism, and looking back, I do see a pattern of control on my GFs part. I was blind to it I guess.\n\nI called my GF and said I was not willing to give up Mittens under any circumstances, and given the recent issues we'd had, and our incompatible views, I thought it was best that we parted ways. I said she deserved a partner that shared her values. She then asked if we were breaking up, I said yes. There was some anger on her end but otherwise the situation actually went better than I expected. \n\nSo, yeah. That's really it.\n\nOh, and several users did ask to see a picture of Mittens. I have uploaded one to imgur:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/WxOk6qG\n\nThanks again to everyone who offered advice. It really helped.",

Is she vegan because she's crazy, or is she crazy because of the veganism?\n\nObviously not all vegans, but this lady is certainly off the deep end.",

That cats eat rodents may be sad but it is a great service. if other animals didn't eat rodents, they would breed and breed and we would all get sick and die.\n\n BTW, not every vegan is a nutjob,. I have been a vegetarian more than 4 decades, now on a vegan diet, and I feed my cats meat, but not beef for environmental reasons. i feed them poultry and very little seafood, because the oceans are overfished. I supplement with some vegan people food, and my cats are long lived and healthy and my vet approves of my care and feeding, my vet whose advice I follow in caring for my cat(s). (I have one now,   but have had many who lived long and were healthy)\n\ni also keep my cat in in the morning so birds and squirrels get a chance to graze without being preyed on. Cats i raised from kittenhood knew not to eat birds, but my current cat was older when I got him, and he is a difficult child. But I have pretty much convinced him to only eat gophers and mice, not bird. He gets praise for catching gophers,  but if he catches a bird I don't punish him for it, but I am sad and take it away from him, and if it's alive, i take it to Native Animal rescue.",

This meant less erosion on the river banks and an increase in many other kinds of wildlife.\n\nHere\u2019s a recent story about it: [https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2020/07/yellowstone-wolves-reintroduction-helped-stabilize-ecosystem/](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2020/07/yellowstone-wolves-reintroduction-helped-stabilize-ecosystem/)",

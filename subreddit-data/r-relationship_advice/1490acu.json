    "postText": "My(20f) girlfriend (23f) and I have been dating for about a year and a half now, and we met through my previous employment.\n\nEverything has been fine for the past year, but for the last couple of months, it hasn't been the best. We've been fighting on and off about small things, especially since I resigned due to mental health problems.\n\nIt's been manageable until recently. About 3 months ago, before I resigned, a new guy(20m) started working in my department(essentially my replacement, since I had put in my two week's notice around that time), and I had to train him. He seemed like a pretty stand up guy, very intelligent, and caught things pretty quickly. I commented on this to my girlfriend, mentioning in a joke that he's the male version of me, since we're born around the same time, have the same hobbies and music type, and are the same height. She brushed it off, and said she'd met him, but she didn't think much of him.\n\nFast forward to a month ago, and she starts talking about him a lot. At this point, our relationship is hanging by a thread, with her commenting a lot that she misses the old me, and she wishes things could go back to normal between us. I notice that she's speaking to him a lot more, during work hours, and while she's at my house.\n\nShe even comments that she's surprised that I'm not insecure about her friendship with him (I wasn't at first, because I assumed the coworker was gay) but she kept going back to the fact that she was surprised I wasn't jealous, with a mischievous grin on her face.\n\nAbout a week ago, she comments that they live a street away from each other, so she'll start dropping him off when they have to work late. I brush it off, since she gives rides to a lot of coworkers, even in different departments especially when they work late.\n\nA week ago, they worked very late, she told me they'd work until about 10. She told me that night she'd be finishing up a bit earlier and she asked me if she gets off at 9, if I'd like to come over. I declined, since I had already gotten in bed, and just wanted to fall asleep after I knew she'd arrived home safely. She kept pushing to come over to my house, and I obliged, and she commented that she'd have to drop the coworker off first, then she'd come. Turns out she was already home for an hour, and he had been over at her house since they got home. I hadn't heard from her since 8, and I assumed she was busy cleaning up a bit.\n\nWhen she got to my house she commented how they had a nice long conversation on their way home, and how much he resembles me when I started working there. She comments that he was pushy to her place since they live so close together, and how he'd love to see what her place looks like.\n\nThis week, she's been avoiding me when I try to kiss her, giving me her cheek, and she's been on her phone constantly. She constantly talks about the coworker, and tells me jokes that he made. He even jokes about being her dog's dad now.\n\nI know this is probably nothing, since I overthink a lot, but she's been a lot different towards me emotionally as well.\n\nAm I delusional?",

It sounds terrible, but at the beginning of the relationship I told her the one thing I don't tolerate is cheating. Besides when we got close to breaking up one time, she did threaten to commit suicide if I were to leave ( I know it's textbook manipulation, it just hasnt seemed to be an issue in that regard since I never thought of breaking up with her before.)\n\nIf I know for a fact she isn't cheating, there would still be a lot of issues for us to go through, but I feel like it'd make it a lot better.",

Even if they're not porking sounds like she's way too into him, is using him to try to make you jealous, and is emotionally withdrawing from you, so call it an emotional affair if you like. There, now you can get out of this crappy relationship. \n\nIf she threatens to kill herself, look her in the eye and say \"welp, if you die you die.

I was in exactly the same headspace in my last relationship and the benefit of hindsight after the fact is you see how genuinely unhappy you have been, for far too long.\n\nWe endure things for those we care about but in the usual paradox that is life, if those people cared about us they wouldn't contribute to us feeling so miserable.\n\nYour partner sounds very disrespectful, and you can either wait for the inevitable or show yourself that lacking respect and give her the boot. The way she's acting is not normal and over time you'll start feeling like you're going mad, don't do that to yourself!",

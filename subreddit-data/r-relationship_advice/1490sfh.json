    "postText": "I (27F) have been dating this guy i like for almost two years, let\u2019s call him Adam (43M). I got out of a pretty abusive/ toxic 4 year relationship with my ex a few months before I met this new guy. When I broke up with my ex, I was super distraught and didn\u2019t really have many friends or support since I became pretty isolated due to our relationship and the pandemic. I met Adam and he was supportive and nice. He would cook for me, rub my feet and just made me feel good. We got along well from the start. However, from the get go I told him I didn\u2019t want a relationship since I\u2019d just gotten out of one and I wanted to \u201cfind myself again\u201d. Especially since I was so young when I got into that long relationship with my ex- who was also older. I wanted a chance to work on my career, make friends, get hobbies and figure out who I am. \n\nHowever we kept seeing each other and gradually escalated into me sleeping at his place almost every night. About 6 months ago, I left town to travel with my best friend (a plan we had had before I started dating Adam). I didn\u2019t think we would stay in touch but we have this whole time, and he has even come to visit. Should I move back to that same town (which I wasn\u2019t really planning to go back to btw) to be with him or should I break up, and move somewhere new, attempt to start over and really find out who I am and what I really want- which I feel like I never got the chance to do? \n\nI love him a lot and I think he\u2019d be a really good father (I want to have kids someday), but also have concerns about some of his behavior and I just don\u2019t want to make a mistake choosing another potentially toxic man if it ends up going south versus choosing myself. He treats me well but there are some similarities to my toxic ex, such as him checking my location, getting upset if I ignore his messages, and saying that my friends who brought up concerns that he was older and may be taking advantage of me in a vulnerable time (fresh breakup when we met) are \u201cjust jealous\u201d. However, he makes me feel safe, he is consistent, supportive, loving, passionate about his work and caring about his family and friends, smart, and makes me feel secure. Those are things I like about him. \n\nSorry for the ranting here, just want to give a full picture. What do you think?",

You do need time to figure things out.  I'd say the best thing is to take a step back and reflect on what you truly want.  Also focus on his not so good traits and see if you see a pattern in the men you choose. \n\nPersonally, all signs at the moment point toward finding yourself.   Anytime I see someone trying to make you turn on friends when they show concern is a huge red flag.  I'd also focus on this.  Someone this controlling doesn't seem like a good candidate for a father.",

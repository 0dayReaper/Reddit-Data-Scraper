    "postText": "I (f18) just began talking to my ex (m18) again after we ended things about three months ago. Yesterday we were talking and he basically said he wanted to gain back my trust because he knows I don\u2019t trust him like I used to after certain things he did after the breakup (ghosting me, immediately getting with other girls/his ex). However, he followed that up with him saying he didn\u2019t want anything official or \u201creal\u201d but he liked keeping me around (his wording threw me off at this part but he can be very bad at wording things so). I honestly don\u2019t think I trust him enough to do that with him. I\u2019m scared he\u2019ll leave me for another girl and I also don\u2019t think I could handle him talking to me while being with other girls. If I trusted him more then maybe I would be ok with it but I just don\u2019t. How should I bring this up in a way that won\u2019t make him mad? I also still want to see him so I think he should know that",

Also, believe him when he says he doesn't want anything official. That's not him being bad at words, that's him being honest and saying you're a placholder until something better comes along. I'm not trying to be an asshole but doesn't sound like you have a good foundation for a relationship and should just move on. It's much better to be single than in a bad relationship.",

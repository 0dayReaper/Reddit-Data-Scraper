I realize that I'm still into my ex and I need time to heal from what happened and I don't think I want a relationship or I want to talk to anyone in the moment but maybe in the future. And I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to hurt you because you're a really nice guy and I really like you. But I don't want to lead you on I'm sorry if I hurt you or made you mad or upset you in some kind of way. I don't want to get into anything until I'm healed because it's just going to make it even worse",

The woman that interests you is obviously going through a difficult emotional transition (very likely still painful), but still has the composure to provide you with honest and clear feedback. That she doesn't want to see you get hurt speaks highly of her character. Give her space, but offer to be a patient listener whenever she needs someone to talk to. Let her know that you appreciate and respect her candor, and that she is the kind of person you hope to befriend in your life.",

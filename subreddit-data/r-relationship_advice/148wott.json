    "postText": "My girlfriend and I both have relatively well-paying jobs. I have owned my own home and lived by myself since I was 26. My girlfriend, who I have been with for a year and a half is 32 and has lived at home with her parents her whole life. She is charged nothing to stay there and has been able to save up a significant amount of money for a down-payment for when she was ready to buy a place of her own.\n\nHer and I have talked casually/ hypothetically about moving in, but agreed that my condo might not quite fit both of our needs. I believed we had a mutual understanding that when she was ready I would sell my place and we would look to purchase a place together, and that this would be within the not-so-distance future (no timeline was specifically set, but we had looked at house prices and had enough discussions for it to be reasonable to assume that we would look to do this sometime in the next 6-18 months).  This was until two weeks ago when she suddenly and unexpectedly booked a viewing on a house for the first time, placed an offer, and had that offer accepted.\n\nIt felt like the rug had pulled out from under me when she told me. I've been incredibly upset and have felt like her purchase was an act of rejection or an indication of her lack of interest of having a future with me. It feels as though any prospect of us starting a life together went from an imminent possibility to something that MIGHT happen 3 years down the road. She says that if we feel ready within the next year I could move into her place with her-- but this doesn't make sense since I think she understands that I would want to be a part of a purchase if it was something that was a possibility so soon.\n\nShe insists she loves me and that she wants to stay with me. She says she doesn't think that her making this purchase has to be considered a bad thing. It's an investment that will appreciate in value; she will be living without her parents and gaining independence (which she has felt is long overdue), and now lives within my city and 10 minutes less of a drive away. Despite these definite pluses I am holding onto some resentment that I'm afraid I won't be able to shed.\n\nIs there anyone else who has had a situation similar to this? I'm having a hard time getting over this and am wondering if an outsider can frame this in a way that can help me view it more positively. I'm afraid that if how I feel doesn't change I'll need to end our relationship, which isn't something I  ever thought I'd need to do.\n\nAny input is appreciated.",

In fact, she may even make a good investment and y'all can one day, IF it gets to marriage, put down a bigger down payments together. You can even decide, for example, to rent out your condo (or her house) when you guys buy your dream house together one day (after marriage).\n\nBut if you can't understand and appreciate that, then you should break up with her.

Of course she did it on her own, that was smart, and not because she doesn\u2019t want to stay with you anymore, but because you are simply not in the place of your relationship to make such a purchase together!\n\nWhy are you seeing her buying her own place as a threat to the relationship? There are no downsides here. Now if all goes well and you both want to upgrade house, you have two houses you can sell, in the meantime she can learn to live on her own (which is absolutely a plus!) and you can proceed with your relationship without the stress of lawyers and paperwork and the \u201cwhat ifs\u201d for an enormous purchase.",

In her mind, she likely approached it from a completely analytical perspective and made judgements based on pure logic.\n\n&gt;She says she doesn't think that her making this purchase has to be considered a bad thing. It's an investment that will appreciate in value; she will be living without her parents and gaining independence (which she has felt is long overdue), and now lives within my city and 10 minutes less of a drive away.\n\nMy guess is that she naively assumed that you would be on board because it \"made sense.\" Unfortunately, some people fail to realize that major decisions need to be discussed with their significant others, no matter how much \"sense\" it makes.\n\nThere is no going back from this, unfortunately -- the deal has been closed, and this will be her home for the foreseeable future. So, ask yourself: is this a home in which you're willing to settle down? And are you willing to live with a person who may repeat a similar offense in the future, potentially excluding you from other major decisions?",

I consider her moving out on her own to be a positive thing.\n\nSecond thought: It is concerning that she had so little discussion with you about her plans/house hunt.  That is a pretty big deal in anyone\u2019s life.  Heck, I get to hear about my coworkers\u2019 house hunts.  That she is trying to minimize how big of a deal it is to you is also concerning.\n\nI think you should find a couples therapist and have a few sessions about how to improve your communication and how to address this sort of conflict and hurt and being on different pages.  Worst case with therapy is you have a few more tools to address these sorts of situations.   If she isn\u2019t interested in therapy to address this threat to your relationship, well that is information for you as well.",

Buying a house is a huge thing for anyone, and it seems like a pretty big secret to keep from your SO. Even if you were to have no input on the decision, it seems like something she would want to share with you. My thought is that she kept this from you bc she knew she wanted to do this, and she knew you wouldn\u2019t like it, so instead of talking to you beforehand, she presented it to you after the deal was done. Maybe she doesn\u2019t like conflict and did it this way to avoid an argument. I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s the conversation to have with her, though. Why did she keep this major life change a secret from you?\n\nHer response may have little to do with how she feels about you and your future together and everything to do with forging her own independence.

You guys seemed to have had extensive, yet not DEEP conversations about this but an understanding at the very least. She completely went left field and got it in her name only. Ok so you\u2019re not married yet, that makes sense but she should\u2019ve communicated that to you and not had you thinking something different. I think she\u2019s dead wrong and honestly just protecting herself \u201cin case\u201d the relationship doesn\u2019t work out. Since she said she still wants to be with you that\u2019s totally up to you to stay or not, but If I were you, I\u2019d keep everything in my name only moving forward. It\u2019s clear she\u2019s not interested in joint assets.",

It sounds like you are upset because you are ready in the near (6-18) months to live together, get married, have kids etc. and she is just getting started learning to be single. Her buying a house is good for her and her future mate because she will know how expensive it is to own a home. The upkeep, the cleaning, the insurance etc. If you are not willing to put the relationship, marriage, kids etc. on hold for a couple extra years then you should talk to her and explain y\u2019all are at different stages in your lives and it would be best to break up.",

You both talked about the future and agreed that when she was ready, you'd buy a house together. This has all but scuppered that idea. You had no say on anything to do with \"her\" house.\n\nThere are many legal mechanisms that can be used in the event of a breakup. Agreements can be signed about living arrangements, division of assets, etc. It didn't require a marriage certificate. What she's done now is put you in a terrible position. \n\nI'm not sure where you go from here. It's time for a big conversation about the future.",

Or move in with her on the condition you won't pay a single cent towards to mortgage or upkeep. That way if you break up you're not getting screwed. Living apart while dating isn't the worst thing on earth. I'd stay in the condo and be happy for her, while protecting my financial security.",

His father divorced their mother when he was 12 after he found out through a paternity test she wasn\u2019t his. My FIL refused to have anything to do with my SIL but continued to have a relationship with my husband, because of this my SIL is very clingy to my husband. My husband is also very protective of his sister and generally doesn\u2019t tolerate anything negative being said about her, which is why I\u2019m posting this here before mentioning anything to him.\n\nMy husband and I bought a house last year which has its own indoor swimming pool. My SIL was super excited when she saw it and asked if she could use it sometimes with her friend. We said it was fine, as long as she gave us a notice before she turned up. Her and her friend (Chloe) have used it many times before but almost never when my husband is home (he is a lawyer and works long hours). With lockdown, my husband has started to work from home. My SIL asked me if she and Chloe could come over and use the pool, I told her I was uncomfortable with them coming over as I\u2019m pregnant and don\u2019t want to accidentally expose the baby to anything risky. My SIL then asked if she and Chloe quarantined for two weeks would they be able to come over, my husband said it was fine.\n\nTwo weeks later they turn up to my house. My husband was in his office, so they go straight to the pool after making small talk. My husband ends up coming out after an hour and we\u2019re hanging out in the kitchen. My SIL walks in to get a drink and she starts talking to my husband. Before she goes back to the pool, she says \u201cChloe\u2019s going to be so happy to see you\u201d. It was weird because my husband and Chloe aren\u2019t close. Chloe comes into the kitchen two minutes later and spends the rest of her time talking to my husband until he excuses himself to get back to work. She\u2019s super giggly and smiley when she talks to him. He would say something sarcastic and she would laugh like it was the funniest joke she\u2019s ever heard. It honestly felt like she was flirting with him. Before she went back to the pool, she gave me this weird smirk-y look. Before they leave, they ask my husband if he\u2019s working from home everyday of the week, he confirms he is.\n\nThe next two weeks, they come over to the house to \u2018swim\u2019 every single day. Except, Chloe never gets in the water. Instead she hangs around the house in her bikini (she was previously wearing a one-piece if it makes a difference) every single day. Whenever my husband comes out to hang around me, she quickly interrupts him and keeps him talking until he has to go back to work. I made lunch for us all and when I excused myself to call my husband down, my SIL quickly stopped me and said Chloe could call him for me. They shared a look and Chloe looked really happy when she went to get him. Chloe has also started to get touchier with my husband. She\u2019s put her hands on his chest and arms, stands or sits really close to him. To my husband\u2019s credit he does usually create space between them whenever she does something like this.\n\nThe reason I believe my SIL is in on this is because she\u2019s made a few pregnancy-related jabs at me recently. She told me a story about how one of her friend\u2019s boyfriends was cheating on her and then said something along the lines of \u201cdid you know a lot of men start cheating when their wives are pregnant?\u201d. She\u2019s also made comments about how I look chubby now and it looks weird next to my husband because he\u2019s \u2018well-built\u2019. If she spots my husband out of the office she quickly goes to inform Chloe.\n\nI know pregnancy hormones can mess with a person\u2019s brain so I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m just looking for something that isn\u2019t there. My SIL sent me a text yesterday asking if they could come over to swim next week and I really want to say no but I know she\u2019ll whine to my husband if I do. I ideally want to have a conversation with him before then but I\u2019m not sure if I should mention the flirting.\n\nAm I being delusional?\n\nTL;DR \u2013 SIL\u2019s and her friend are constantly asking to come over to use our pool but her friend never swims. Instead, she waits around to start talking with my husband. She seems very flirtatious whenever she talks to him but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just pregnancy hormones getting to me.\n\n**UPDATE \u2013**\n\nWell, I read and reread all of the comments on the original post to try and figure out how I was going to bring up the issue. Turns out, I didn\u2019t have to. We were watching a movie and my phone lit up with another text from my SIL telling me she was now going to be here at 1pm the next day to swim with Chloe. My husband saw it and told me to tell her not to come. This is really weird behaviour for my husband because he tends to do anything to accommodate my SIL and very rarely refuses her anything. I asked him if something had happened and he shrugged it off and we kept watching the movie.\n\nA few minutes later he paused the movie and said he wanted to ask me a question. He asked if I\u2019d noticed Chloe never swam when she came to our house. I wish I could say I was calm and collected like the comments were advising but\u2026 I ended up laughing hysterically. I was honestly just so relieved he\u2019d brought it up instead of me having to be the one to do it. I think my husband thought I was losing my mind.\n\nWhen I finally stopped laughing, he repeated the question and said he wanted a serious answer. I said, \u201cof course I\u2019ve noticed\u201d and he awkwardly replied \u201cso\u2026 you must\u2019ve noticed the other thing too\u201d. To summarise the conversation that followed: My husband hadn\u2019t noticed Chloe was flirting with him the first few days because he was so busy with work, he wasn\u2019t really paying attention to anything else. He said when she started getting handsy is when he suddenly had the \u2018light bulb\u2019 moment that she was into him. He says he didn\u2019t want to unnecessarily stress me out, so he never mentioned anything, but he was worried I\u2019d noticed too and thought he was interested because he hadn\u2019t immediately shut it down. He realised we would eventually have to have this talk, but he wasn\u2019t sure how to bring it up (oh the irony). He did privately speak to Chloe and told her he was happily married and wasn\u2019t interested in starting anything with anyone else. Apparently, she never took him seriously because she kept doing it.\n\nIn the end, he called his sister on Sunday to tell her either she got her to stop or Chloe couldn\u2019t come over anymore. His sister ended up having a tantrum and said a few nasty things about me/the baby/our relationship. She insisted I was somehow behind his request and made some comments about how I was controlling and insecure because I looked like a \u2018beach whale\u2019 and Chloe was younger and hotter. He was pretty pissed at this and said if she said something like that about me again, he would stop speaking to her. She claimed I had baby trapped him and when my husband pointed out we were already married so I didn\u2019t need to \u2018trap\u2019 him and that he was the one who wanted to start a family she kept insisting I had manipulated him into feeling that way. She claimed he was unhappy in our relationship and he always looked \u2018tired\u2019 because I was forcing him to slave away to fund my fancy lifestyle, whilst I sat on my ass all day. He pointed out he chose to be a lawyer knowing he would have to work long hours and I had only recently left my job, so her accusations were baseless.\n\nShe said some other stuff along the same lines but the thing that made my husband finally snap was when she said \u2018it\u2019 (the baby) was already ruining everything and it was just going to get worse when it was born and he should\u2019ve dragged me to the abortion clinic whilst he had the chance. He told her neither her nor Chloe were welcome in our home anymore until they apologised for how they\u2019d been behaving and for the things my SIL said. He said he wasn\u2019t sure he could ever forgive or forget what she\u2019d said about our child even if she did apologise and he couldn\u2019t believe she would even think something like that, let alone say it. Apparently, she started crying and said she was sorry, that she didn\u2019t mean it and she was just scared to lose him and that she wasn\u2019t thinking clearly. He hung up on her. He showed me his phone and she\u2019s been calling him and texting him since begging him to reply.\n\nHe asked if she\u2019d said anything to me. I was debating whether to say anything or not, but he kept insisting he knew she had said something, and he wanted to know what it was. I told him the things I mentioned in the original post and a few other things she had said. He asked me why I never mentioned anything when she first said it and I mentioned how he got really defensive whenever I said anything even slightly negative about his sister and he\u2026 got defensive. I pointed out he was doing it again and after some back and forth he admitted that \u201cmaybe he was a little bit defensive when it came to her\u201d but he promised to stop and he wanted to make sure we could talk about anything, including his sister.\n\nHe ended up mentioning wanting to try couples counselling. He said it wasn\u2019t because he thought there was something wrong with our relationship but apparently he has been speaking to his dad a lot recently and he mentioned one thing he regretted about his marriage with MIL is that they never went to therapy until the cracks in their relationship were too big. In his current marriage they go, and it\u2019s helped him avoid the mistakes of his first marriage. I agreed, so we\u2019re probably going to try that soon.\n\nMy husband thinks my SIL will eventually turn up even if we tell her not to, but he promised he\u2019d deal with her if she does.\n\nSo, reddit I guess you were right. I really did just need to speak to him. Thanks for the advice and comments, I enjoyed reading them all.\n\nTL;DR \u2013 We talked. Husband already confronted both the friend and SIL. SIL said some really shitty things so we won\u2019t be contacting her for a while. Communication is key folks! ;)",

Seeing him suggest counseling before minor issues grow into actual problems is so good to see, I\u2019m glad he\u2019s so invested in making sure their relationship is the best it can be! A lot of people balk at counseling because they see it as having failed, but I see it as a great thing, it\u2019s right there in the name after all! It\u2019s having a neutral (professional) party guide couples through what could otherwise be pitfalls in marriage, and teach them the best ways to support, communicate, and problem-solve in a healthy way.",

If you've identified problems, even minor ones, getting ahead of them is extremely effective, and often a counsellor is a good way to do this in a safe space without having to navigate the territory alone and worry about one or another not cooperating fully.\n\nThe problem is you can't really counsel nothing. You can't get ahead of problems that aren't there yet, and to be honest it doesn't sound like there's actually problems in OPs relationship that require counselling; they could do with quicker communication, sure, and that's something to work on, but you can't pre-emptively counsel away problems. What it's good for is providing the tools to avoid needing their services more seriously.\n\nOPs husband, however, might benefit from individual sessions regarding his sister. It's clearly not just an issue with their relationship but rather an issue between him and his sister that needs addressing in a one-to-one environment; the issue isn't about OP and him and his sister, but him and his attitude to her in general.",

I've been going to couples' sessions with my husband - like a lot of folks, we started going when our relationship's 'cracks' became really apparent (about a month into covid, but issues that have been building for a long time). We've benefited from it immensely and have been doing better than we have in years, in many ways. In our past few sessions we haven't really had anything negative to process with our counselor, so he prompted us to identify the things that \\*are\\* working. So we're approaching things through a constructive lens, rather than a damage control lens. Even though we're like giddy newlyweds again, the work isn't over - our sessions are helping us remain mindful of this state, so we can make it a sustainable and long-term feeling, rather than a temporary spike. It has been insanely helpful.  \n\n\nCouples' counseling isn't just solving existing arguments, it's helping couples to address individual concerns/stressors that will impact the relationship as a whole. Counseling provides a place for those issues to be aired out, and ideally, addressed \\*before\\* they become critical. Even when things are \"good,\" it's important to have a designated space to self-reflect and be heard!",

Your DH has filled the father figure and now she fears he will bail on her cos the new baby, and that has to be really scary. She is dealing with it  with the tools she know, with deception and cheating.",

Mediation possibly needed from an outsider. But it could be good for the sil and op to actually open up about what sil issue is. It could be that she feels left out, thrown away, no longer important, and while your hubby has obviously been trying with her, I think she needs to be sure that you arent going to steal him away and ruin everything. To be honest I feel like if there was some significant counseling and help given to her and a little time and effort, you two could end up having a somewhat half decent relationship",

She needs to be made to face that her brother has several obligations that necessarily come before her, and that this is healthy and as it should be. There's only so much reassurance she should be given of her importance. Too much tea and sympathy may keep her from gaining the perspective she needs.

Sometimes when someone has an unhealthy reliance on someone, the best thing to create a healthy relationship is to stop helping them because that's actually just enabling their behavior.

Also relationship maintenance is NEVER a bad idea even in the happiest marriages. Good luck, glad things turned out well for you!",

You also need to watch your back.\n\nHer ideal outcome right now involves the child being gone and your husband not loving you anymore. Even if she is not a diabolical mastermind, she might do something horrible that she *thinks* is a brilliant ploy to get you and the child out of the picture.\n\nI agree that you should have a security system installed. Your sister-in-law has stated that she wishes your child didn't exist. This is not the same thing as threatening to do anything about it, but still, it's super scary IMO. Although you don't know whether she would actually go this far, you don't want to find out.\n\nMaybe I'm being too paranoid about this, but her actions as you have described them are impulsive and short-sighted, and her description of your husband's feelings of happiness and attachment as being false things that were forced upon him by you are totally f****** scary. That means that no matter what he says, she feels like it's in his interest to break up your marriage, and she might do something extreme and irrational in the name of saving her brother from you.\n\nOr, maybe she's being a brat and will get over it once she realizes that she's not losing her brother just because he's going to have a family. You're the only one who's going to be able to read her behavior and judge whether this is going to blow over or she's going to turn into a psycho.\n\nThe silver lining to all of this is that based on what you said, she has absolutely no poker face and you have a pretty good sense for nonverbal communication clues. She doesn't seem particularly clever or subtle, so with the exception of lying about it, her actions are probably going to reveal her intentions pretty clearly.\n\nThis is a good topic to discuss in therapy: what does your husband think she's going to do, and why? If there are multiple possibilities, which ones does he think is the most likely? What does your husband think is appropriate to do in order to protect himself and you and the child? What do you think is appropriate to do? What does your husband think is excessive or paranoid, and what should you both be watching for from her in order to figure out what you're going to do next? I'm just some random guy on the internet who is freaking out about your story, but you guys know her, so as long as you communicate and understand each other's feelings and concerns and deal with this together, you should be fine.",

I guess I can\u2019t blame him after she was the product of such betrayal and the father walked out on her. But this will be an issue your whole life.\n\nWhat the sister did was not just annoying or misplaced fear. It was downright evil. I\u2019m serious, the things she said were evil. And people like her will never forget that he cares for you and she is going to back for round 2 at some point.\n\nIt\u2019s true that you don\u2019t marry the person, you marry the family. It sounds like for now, your husband has his priorities straight.\n\nBut my advice is to stay vigilant. Be on the lookout for her to try again. Be wary anytime they have one on one time, because she is never going to stop. You have what\u2019s hers and she will never let go.",

The first thing we did was couples counseling and it saved our relationship and helped us build the foundation of our family. Your FIL is right, couples therapy is a waste if you go when you already have problems. You should go before; it\u2019s like giving your car a check up, but it\u2019s also giving you both the tools and knowledge to confront potential issues. \n\nHowever, what I took away most from our time in counseling was working on our transition. Going from being in a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship to be a family unit is tough and takes concerted effort. The same can be said to an extent with transitioning from husband/wife. It\u2019s easier but the transition is still necessary. You need to both realize and come to terms that you\u2019re both entering into a difficult period and you need to build a solid base and foundation, to acknowledge roles, to understand that you are both coming together as one unit to raise a family. Counseling allowed my wife and I the knowledge and vehicle to make that transition and we\u2019ve been a unit ever since. Just introduced baby #2 into this world last week and I\u2019ve never been happier. \n\nso just to bring it full circle, I\u2019m really happy for you and your husband that you\u2019re going to counseling. Best thing to happen to my relationship and I hope the same for you!",

Chloe sounds like a tramp and if you weren\u2019t pregnant, my advice would be to punch her in her mouth. Your SIL sounds like a troublemaker and a bit of a brat. I think she is jealous of you and your husbands relationship and family. As for your husband, this may be the first time on reddit, I actually have to say...I think he was completely clueless to the whole thing. I think you landed yourself a good one.\n\nThen I got to your update...I\u2019m actually really happy for you! First off, your pregnant and you don\u2019t need any undue stress. I\u2019m glad that your husband caught on to what Chloe and your SIL were doing because they couldn\u2019t have been more obvious if they tried. The comments about your unborn baby are pretty unforgivable in my book. I\u2019m not sure an apology would make me feel any better. It was hateful and something she felt and had been thinking about or she wouldn\u2019t have said it to begin with. So, fuck her.\n\nI think it\u2019s great that you &amp; your husband go to counseling before there are problems. It can only strengthen your marriage. And, with your precious little one coming, there are big changes ahead. Don\u2019t get me wrong, beautiful changes. But, you will both be sleep deprived and two becomes three-which is an adjustment at first. But, I have no doubt you\u2019ll pull through. Congratulations on your upcoming baby!",

Good luck with couple\u2019s counseling, and here\u2019s to a long, healthy future together!!\n\n\u2014Also, I\u2019m wondering if SIL and her friend even bothered quarantining, since they clearly didn\u2019t care about your wellbeing.",

A perfect villain.\n\nMain character is a Mary Sue with endless patience who always takes the high road, never reacts in a realistic way or loses composure.\n\nStory ends with couples counseling, Reddit's favorite go-to solution for all things.\n\nI'd bet dollars to donuts that this is either a single, bitter woman with an agenda against \"hot girls\" who are have successful love lives. Or it could just be anyone, man or woman, who wanted to try their hand at a little creative writing project in order to get Reddit points. Anyone who takes it at face value would praise the MC and vilify the evil step sister and her hussie friend.\n\nIt's fun to read, but an obvious fabrication.",

I'm glad he seems to see that and I hope he stands firm. The SISTER needs therapy more than both of you honestly. But I'm glad it worked out for you.",

    "postText": "We\u2019ve known each other for over a year now and met through friends of friends. We are part of a friend group of about 8 people and we are the only 2 that are single. We don\u2019t hang out all the time but the group chat is active enough where we chat and hang out about twice a month. Her and I normally text outside the group chat as we get along super well, both love movies, and just genuinely enjoy talking to one another. We have never talked about being involved romantically and have both, willingly or unwillingly, avoided talking about our romantic affairs in each other\u2019s presence. \n\nFrom what I see, she is constantly asking for my opinion, laughing at my jokes, and giving me attention; yet I believe she is hooking up with some guy. Just a month ago we went to a concert with a group and she met up with a dude and hid away from us. When I was leaving said concert, I nearly left without saying bye to her (given I had noticed and was a bit bothered) and she came out to say good bye. My friends all say she looks and talks to me differently, but I also think it\u2019s my group of homies just trying to gas me up.\n\nI\u2019m going on a trip with 5 of the friends and she is joining. Should I tell her something then? Maybe before? I don\u2019t think keeping emotions to myself is the best idea, yet I keep thinking there just would be a clearer sign if she was into me. Waiting for something to happen is never the right way to go but idk what to do. Am I an idiot? Should I say fuck it and go for it or wait for some clarity?",

Stop falling deeper for her until she reciprocates. Consider it a lost cause for your own sake.\n\nIf you come out guns blazing and go:\n\n&gt;I have been harbouring feelings for you all this time and I want you to be mine, what do you think of that?\n\nThat is too extreme if its out of the blue... Which is what you'd basically would doing.\n\nDon't emotionally dump on a person, instead, emotionally develop with a person.\n\nTry to take what you have right now, and bring it do the next level. Ignore the interference.\n\nThrow a couple flirty comments out there and see how she responds. Start talking to her more than average. If she reciprocates, play that game for a bit, let it develop. Ask her to hang out one on one. If that goes well, do it a few more times... Then present the idea for a date when everything is set in place.\n\nAnd please don't shoot yourself in the foot for successfully flirting once and getting mad at her interacting with other men.\n\nOnce the two of you have gone on a couple of **defined dates,** a romantic foundation, then you have a right to communicate that you're not interested in playing games.",

Call it being a Nice Guy, whatever, I wish I had been more up-front with people.\n\nIt's hard, but right now, she's going to date guys who ask her out.\n\nYou need to be clear, and shoot your shot. Standing idly by, while she gets with other guys, then being upset isn't doing you any favours.\n\nIf you ask, and she says 'no', then at least you know and can just enjoy your friendship with her while you explore other romantic opportunities elsewhere.",

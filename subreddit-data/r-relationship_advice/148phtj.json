    "postText": "TLDR; my parents hate my partner and think she\u2019s manipulating me, I feel like I have ample evidence to suggest otherwise, and they bring it up so much I don\u2019t want to talk to them anymore.\n\nMy partner and I met early 2021, and fell for each other pretty quickly. We have the best communication I\u2019ve ever had with a partner, she supports my butch identity in a very validating way, and we have extremely compatible life goals. I have always liked caring for others and I always thought if I got married I would be the one who works and I wouldn\u2019t really mind if my partner had a job or not. My partner does not want to work full time but really helps me in organizing my apartment, cleaning, and giving me reminders since I\u2019m forgetful. I do not take care of myself well when alone and will forget to do essential things like eat or go to the bathroom, so having someone who cares for me in that way is an amazing aspect of my relationship that I\u2019m really grateful for. Right now we are both working, and also looking for higher paying jobs. My partner has job hopped several times while we\u2019ve been together to land tolerable, higher paying jobs.\n\nMy partner is also a \u201cpassenger princess,\u201d which is I think very common in butch/femme relationships but happens in straight relationships too, lol. When we are together I always drive, when she\u2019s alone she just takes the train or walks around town. She\u2019ll occasionally ask me to take her to somewhere more inaccessible like the doctor, and we usually make it into a date where we also go get lunch etc.\n\nAfter all the context, here is the issue - my parents, since meeting my partner, have disliked her. They think her job hopping, not driving, and general position in a retail setting is an indication that she\u2019s taking advantage of me (she makes 3x more than I do, currently). Simultaneously, they are upset because I don\u2019t bring her to visit, which I don\u2019t do because they are unpleasant to her and honestly to me every time I bring her around. They\u2019re also telling me that she\u2019s isolating me from my friends and family, despite me telling them I get together with friends or at least chat on the phone with them 3-4 times a week. I also see my parents about once or twice a month, which maybe I\u2019m wrong but it seems frequent.\n\nThey bring up some aspect of this every time she comes up in conversation to the point where it has made me question my reality and experiences a few times. When I try to address it they either end the conversation, tell me I can\u2019t tell when I\u2019m being taken advantage of, or on several occasions my mom will just start to cry. It makes me feel insane - I\u2019m in what I perceive to be a fulfilling relationship, my partner is so sweet and funny and always is there when I\u2019m down, we encourage each other to spend time with friends, and I feel supported. But their reactions to her are seem so disproportionally negative that I don\u2019t even bring her up around them anymore. I want to have a relationship with my parents but I hate that they talk about her like this. Is this worth going NC over? And if so, how have others handled that process?\n\nAlso, because I think it\u2019s relevant: my friends have met my partner and they get along, and even have conversations as friends not involving me, which I feel like shows they are not just \u201ctolerating\u201d her for my sake. I also get along with my partners parents and they\u2019re good to me.\n\nEdit: y\u2019all I\u2019m not pissing my pants nor am I requiring people to remind me to do this nor am I relying on anyone to remind me of this. I have ADHD which can disregulate your ability to pick up on cues your body sends to meet needs. This doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m starving or walking about with piss pants, I just in periods of high stress wait until my needs are at very high levels to meet them. It is a disorder and it affects my life like any disorder would and I find ways to regulate it lol. I am capable of living on my own and I only mentioned it to demonstrate ways in which someone cares and checks in on me that I appreciate. I am currently unmedicated due to the shortage and I can\u2019t really do anything about whether my pharmacy stocks adderall or not",

She helps you with your specific needs in a way your parents clearly don\u2019t understand, and you help her in ways your parents again, do not understand.  If going no contact would help them to understand they are the problem, then that might be a good idea.  It doesn\u2019t sound at all like your partner is insisting on this or pressuring you, which would actually be abuse, it sounds a lot more like they are trying to break you two up out of what they think a standard couple is supposed to look like.  If your partner needs you to drive, and you need her for emotional support and help with your adhd, if you have both agreed upon the things you need from each other, then no one else\u2019s opinion matters.  I will say, I really think you should ask your partner about what her feelings are about your parents and the way they treat her and think about her, and make sure she is on board with going no contact if that\u2019s what you decide.  Making that a joint decision will take some pressure off of both of you.\n\nAnd my parents really did not love that I am on the butcher side either.  That could be a factor, my girlfriends have always had something wrong with them, but the high school boyfriend I haven\u2019t talked to for nine years was just oh so nice.  I was a lot more feminine before I came out.  This really could be the reason.",

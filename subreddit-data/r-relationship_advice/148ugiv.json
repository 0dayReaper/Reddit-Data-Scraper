    "postText": "Hi,\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I have been engaged for about a year, in a relationship for 3. Recently, he has been pushing me away and just straight up ignoring me. We\u2019re long distance, and we haven\u2019t seen each other in over a month. The last time we saw each other we had a large argument, and it seems every time we FaceTime we butt heads. Today, he just straight up ignored me, canceled his plans to see me this weekend, and refused to talk to me tonight; what do I do? I don\u2019t wanna call off the wedding, but if our relationship is gonna be like this I would rather stay single.",

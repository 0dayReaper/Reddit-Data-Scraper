    "postText": "this past weekend, tried to talk to 33M about some things he's done while under the influence of booze. he was calling, messaging other older women while I was away for work purposes. I am 26F, with my own place, vehicle &amp; a decent job.\n\nhere's the tea. I was away for 4 days about a 10 hr drive from the city, focusing on the work that needed to get done, while he stayed behind to work his job. \nI found out about the messaging, as my gut was sore after I got home. Went to the bathroom, fed myself and it was still sore. He was drinking the night I got back &amp; decided to wait till he passed out to snoop his phone. I was right, he had contacted other women. Also I should mention, after I snooped on his phone, this is the 4th time he's done this. He blames his drinking &amp; split personality of doing things to sabotage him having a good life. \n\nI do blame myself for not giving any sexual attention, but why should I?! when he never spends time with me! we lived together, we game together, sleep next together, and go to work. \n\nNow he's asking when he can come back to my home. I've been thinking of reasons why he should come back, but nothing is coming up. I don't trust him, I don't love him, but I like him. \n\nNow I am unsure of what to respond with as its been an hour since we last texted. help?\n\n**maybe I'm too scared to be blunt about this... idk",

He's an adult and can control his actions.  \n\nYou don't love so stop before you get even more involved.  Not giving sexual attention is not an excuse for looking outside the relationship.  He's not worth the annoyance...walk away.",

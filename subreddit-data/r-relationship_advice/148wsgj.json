    "postText": "This is a very complicated situation but pretty much I've been seeing this girl for about 6 months and we got very close within that time and have pretty much been doing everything people who date do without the label. I just graduated college and she still has a year a left and the last day I saw her I contessed my true feelings for her which made her cry but didn't really say if she felt the same way.\nFast forward I eventually ask if she wants to become official and she said she would but doesn't think it would be a good idea since we're both gonna be in different places which I agreed with. We continued talking and we hung out one day in my hometown since she doesn't live too far and the whole time we were still acting like a couple holding hands, making out and such and we seemed closer than ever. But she recently came back from a trip overseas and I saw on one of her friends phone her private story about how she misses a guy she was with and a separate post saying \"I chose wrong\" which l'm 100% sure is referring to me. l'm really not sure what to do because when we talk it seems like she's still interested but at this point I don't really trust this person and i know she lies a lot in general. A part of me just wants to cut her off because I think she's just using me for attention but I also do wanna potentially see her again just for casual sex lol but I can't pretend like there aren't true feelings there as well given I'm bothered by her posts and all this is stressing me out. Should I talk to her about this? Just ignore it and keep it regular? Or should I just cut her off altogether?",

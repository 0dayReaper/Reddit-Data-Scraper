    "postText": "EDIT: Link to the original if anyone's looking: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\\_advice/comments/e1py86/i24m\\_adopted\\_my\\_little\\_sister8f\\_after\\_our\\_parents/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e1py86/i24m_adopted_my_little_sister8f_after_our_parents/)\n\nHey people, it's been a while since my original post and I have some free time today and not much to do with it so I'm gonna write this, why not.\n\nA lot happened since my first post, in the end, my GF, now ex I guess, couldn't deal with the fact that I had a new priority. I admit that I wasn't the best at managing time between them two and I would spend a lot more with my sister than my GF but I think that's understandable, maybe. In general, my GF was on and off with my sister, one day she would be the nicest person to her and the other would completely blow her off and be borderline mean. I had a few talks with her that it needs to stop, but it would only end up working for maybe the rest of the week and the next it would be back to square one. About three weeks ago it erupted into a big argument, she accused me of not loving her anymore, and that I play favorites. I told her they're not my children to be playing favorites and that obviously for some time my sister is gonna need a lot more attention, since you know she lost her parents. In the end, she went back to her ultimatum, sister or her. I was angry at this point, because she has been mean to my sister that day, and I told her she can pack her shit and find a place to sleep tonight. I haven't seen her since and quite frankly I don't really want to. We texted for a bit, basically both sides confirming its over and arranging when she can come for the rest of her stuff.\n\nAs for my sister, she's a lot better. She doesn't stay in her room all day anymore and she's slowly going back to her talkative old self. She still doesn't like being alone but it was the same before the accident, so since my gf moved out, we've been sharing a bed for comfort. She still wakes up at night crying sometimes so it's better when I'm there and frankly it's a lot more comfortable. One thing I really regret is my sister heard that whole fight and she started apologizing to me for breaking me and my GF up, I ensured her it's not her fault at all and if anything she helped me see for who my GF really was. She still goes to her therapist and it's really helped a ton, she doesn't need me to be there while she falls asleep and doesn't panic when I go to the shop for 15 minutes.\n\nAll in all, these past 3 months have been the hardest time in my life but eye opening to my ex's disregard for my family and kind of me too. Sorry for no happy ending, I guess this is how real life is.\n\nEDIT2: I would love to thank everybody for kind words individually but with this amount it's crazy, so I wanna give everyone who gave me advice and kind words a HUGE THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY YOU'RE ALL AMAZING. These numbers are overwhelming and I can't even express in words how it feels that so many people care, it's really something else. Didn't expect that strangers on the internet could make me cry either, so once again a huge THANK YOU.",

They were together for 9 years and she is 23--so they got together at 14/15. He quotes her as saying he \"was her entire world\" for 13 years.   \n\n\nThis situation completely toppled her codependent little world: his parents (who it sounds like she was close to?) died, which brings up all kinds of feelings, she's trying to be there for her grieving boyfriend, and suddenly there's a kid living with her.  So while I think she can intellectually recognize that she needs to be there for his bf and his sister, she doesn't have the emotional fortitude to handle it all. I'm not sure I could have at 23.  \n\n\nAll of that being said, I have the most sympathy for OP and the little sister. It's horribly tragic and I noticed that OP really doesn't seem to acknowledge his own feelings very much, or prioritize his own grief. :( He's basically moving from one fire to the next--comforting his grieving sis, to managing his girlfriend's insecurities. I hope he finds peace and takes care of himself.\n\nHonestly, it's good for all of them that this relationship ended. OP can focus on processing his grief and building his relationship with his little sister. The little sis can find her footing without feeling resented. GF can go off and",

Yes - the ultimatum was a stupid thing to say, and feeling 'jealous' of OP's 8-year old sister so soon after their parents passing away is also illogical. However, considering all the pressure and the emotion coming out of the situation, it sounds as though she did the right thing by leaving.\n\nAt the end of the day, people are saying that she didn't have to be a mum. But yes, she absolutely would have been forced into a position such as a guardian, if OP and her were living together - not consciously (no matter how much OP says otherwise), but by matter of default. If she's not ready for that, she isn't ready and I don't think it would be fair for that to be forced onto a 23 year old that isn't ready for some form of motherhood.\n\nI'm really not enjoying all these comments coming out saying she's a 'psycho' or 'crazy'. Very few people are thrust in this situation and I honestly don't know what I'd do if this was thrust upon me. I don't think anyone can.",

Like \"I think we should take a break because we're losing connection the past month, after your parents died\" or something.\n\nShe's certainly not at fault for not wanting this situation put on her, but you'd think after 9 years being together she'd be more supportive.\n\nEdit: ***Although***, this is 9 years from 14 and 15. They were very young when they got together and perhaps it made them grow up more dependant on each other, or at least in her case. Hopefully She'll realize some life lessons, grow a bit, and learn to be more independent, and maybe  they can try again if OP wants to.",

I would have been right around the age that you are now. I left a job behind, and a relationship. But it was simply what had to be done at the time.\n\nMy stepmother and I had a rough relationship, but she would always look at my sister and I and say \"wow, you guys look just alike. You know when your dad and I are gone, you better take care of your little sister\" (12 year age difference). It never made sense to me until her passing.\n\nNow she is in high school and got a 4.5 GPA last semester, she is excelling in sports, and she is just an all around great kid who has been through so much. Moving back was hard, and I had to let a lot go but in the end it all worked out and I never would have met what is now my wife had I not made the move.\n\nNot that my opinion really matters, but I have a tremendous amount of respect for what you have done.",

It was at the point where he was so disruptive in class that he had been suspended multiple times and they were looking at alternative education. At the end of my rope, crying and feeling hopeless one night I stumbled across an article on the behavioral and social issues surrounding ADHD and felt a weight lift off of my shoulder. Spoke with his doc, started meds and counseling and within a week, he was a model student.",

That\u2019s basically your child. \n\nAt a young age, I was in and out of foster homes with my younger brother and I was only three years older than him- I never made him feel alone or unwanted. I was only 7 at the time. As of now, him and I are best friends. Fully functioning adults with great lives. All the time we have talks between each other that no one on this earth could understand the appreciation for saving one another. You\u2019ll understand when she is older, I promise you.  The things you do for a sibling is absolutely unmatchable to anything you can ever experience. Your parents taught you that subconsciously.

It's important to take some time to relax and do things you enjoy. \n\nIt's not the same, but when I was a teen my friend was in a car accident and both of her parents were killed. Our families had been friends for years and we ended up adopting her into our family. There was a lot of grief and challenges but also eventually joy in our deepened relationship as well.

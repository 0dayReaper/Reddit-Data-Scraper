    "postText": "I (19M) recently came into contact with someone (19F) that I went to school with. We talked for a while and then she disclosed that she had feelings for me. I told her I felt the same (which I did at the time) and we hung out a few times. It never went past that. No kissing, sex, anything like that. \n\nEventually we started talking less and less. I thought she was mad at me for something but didn't bother reaching out as I was losing my feelings for her. I realized that she just wasn't what I'm looking for in a relationship.\n\nAnyway, after not talking for a while, she reached out again and said that she thought I was mad at her. I told her I wasn't and she started talking to me more. \n\nI'm now worried that she's going to want to pick up where we left off, however I have no interest in doing so. I also think that at this point it would be awkward if we remained friends, but I also don't want to hurt her in the process. What can I do to let her off easy?",

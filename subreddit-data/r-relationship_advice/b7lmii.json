    "postText": "***Note: Please do not use ancestry kits as a paternity test. If you genuinely want to check your child is your own - get a proper paternity test at  your local MedLab (medical lab). Ancestry tests are not accurate, and should not be used to test paternity. In my case, it simply raised the alarm to get a proper test.***\n\n--------------\n\nI apologize if this is not an appropriate sub to ask. I posted this on  r/relationships but it was locked, and the mod suggested I ask on r/parenting. But I also want relationship advice on how to deal with my wife, so I want to ask for advice here, too.\n\n--------------------\n\nFirst of all, I'm sorry if this ends up being long and rambly, I am not really in the best state of mind. My world has been turned upside down over the last couple of weeks. I just want to write as much context as possible so I can get the best advice needed. For obvious reasons, I am not yet comfortable talking about this with my friends/parents/siblings.\n\n---------------------\n\nBackground: I met my wife when we were in highschool and we married in college. We have 5 beautiful children together - really, I consider them a total blessing regardless of what I'm about to bring up - and up until a couple of weeks ago I thought that we had the perfect marriage. We were typical highschool sweet hearts, we go out together, we never fight, I feel like I've done everything a loving husband should do. I am saying this not to make myself out as the perfect husband, for example my work has always meant I work long hours and maybe haven't always been there when she needed me, but I want to stress that I've never felt our marriage was in any trouble. And never in a million years would I ever have suspected my wife of being disloyal - she's always done everything she could to support me and take care of our children.\n\nNow, my eldest daughter recently had an ancestry test done. And the results of the ancestry test strongly suggested I was not her father. She confided this to me privately, showing me the results and I could tell she was visibly upset by this. Of course, the first thing I did was reassure her that no matter what, she's my daughter and I'll always love her unconditionally. But secondly, the two of us decided to get an official paternity test since the ancestry tests are not completely reliable. It comes back and I am indeed not her biological father.\n\nThis news really broke me. I'm ashamed to say I broke down in tears in front of my daughter. The combination of finding out about my wife's infidelity and how upset I was making my daughter by how I was reacting. I really wish I had kept it in for her sake, but I didn't.\n\nFollowing this I asked my other children, except my youngest, to come and see me. I wanted to know the extent of my wife's infidelity - if it was a one off, I could maybe work past it, especially given how long ago it would be. However I didn't want to tell my youngest as she is still in school, a teenager, and really I didn't think it was appropriate to tell her yet.\n\nWe tell the other three what has happened, I reassure them that I love them unconditionally and that I'll always be there dad, but that I need to know how long this has been going on. God, I can't begin to explain how touching their reaction was. They didn't care I wasn't their biological father, they were just upset at how heart broken I was. I feel like the only thing that has kept me going these last couple of weeks is their unwavering support.\n\nSo we have paternity tests for each of the three done. Not only are none of them my biological children, together four of my children have three different fathers. Which somehow made it worse. It's like, she wasn't just having an ongoing affair, she was having multiple? I can't explain how this make it worse, but it just does.\n\nSo I confront my wife with this, expecting her to confess and beg for forgiveness. She doesn't confess. She doesn't even take it seriously. She says the tests must be flawed. All four? How the hell am I supposed to take that seriously?\n\nI keep bringing it up and she keeps brushing it off, getting progressively more annoyed at me. When I bring it up she will try and guilt trip me. \"We've been together since highschool, do you seriously not trust me?\" etc. But how am I supposed to trust her in the face of such overwhelming evidence?\n\nNow that I have rambled and explained what has happened. I guess let me ask a few direct questions for advice\n\n1. How can I reassure my children this doesn't change anything between us? I feel like the way I have reacted, total break downs, has made them second guess this despite however many times I reassure them.\n\n2. How do I handle my youngest daughter? I feel like our marriage is beyond saving, and I will need to tell my daughter something. I don't want her to know the truth until she's older, but I also don't want my wife lying and making me out to be the villain.\n\n3. Is there anyway, anyway at all, you think I could or should save my marriage? I've been with my wife my entire life it's almost impossible to see a life without her. I know that the answer should be a clear cut \"leave her\", but we have 5 kids together. If there's anything that can be done to save our marriage, I want to consider it seriously.\n\ntl;dr: Found out at least 4 of my 5 kids are not mine. Wife refuses to confess her infidelity. Unsure of how to do what's best for my children and marriage.\n\n--------------------------\n\nEdit: Thanks so much to everyone for all the support and advice. I have not replied to as many comments as I should have, but I've read each and every one and taken your advice to heart. I'll continue reading any comments or messages you send me. Again, I can't begin to thank you for all your support. If this is resolved I might post an update, but if she continues to lie then I don't think I'll bother, as there's not much more I can add. From the advice in this and the r/parenting thread I've decided to:\n\n1. Get second tests just in case some freak accident has occurred.\n\n2. Confront my wife with all four of my older children present.\n\n3. Tell my youngest of the situation. Ask her if she wants to have a paternity test. It will be entirely her decision.\n\n4. I'm 100% going to get some form of therapy. My mental state has really been deteriorating over the last couple of weeks, and I owe it to my kids to hold it to together.\n\n5. Depending on whether my wife tells the truth, and what her explanation is (if any), I have not ruled out some form of counselling. But at the moment I think divorce is inevitable unless she changes her attitude drastically.\n\n6. Contact a lawyer and prepare for divorce, if it comes to that\n\nOnce again I'd like to thank all of you for the time you took to express your support and share advice.\n\n--------------------\n\nEdit2: I guess I should clarify some things that people have been asking\n\n1. **How did the ancestry results suggests I wasn't her father?** My family is entirely Irish. No relatives outside of Ireland other than my immediate family, and I even have the stereotypical red hair. My daughter's ancestry results showed nothing from the British isles/western Europe/northern Europe. That's what set off alarm bells, but it's by no means conclusive, hence the paternity tests.\n\n2. **Which two children share the same father?** My two eldest daughters share the same father.\n\n3. **How did your wife conceive your children?** Our eldest daughter was not planned. All the others were planned. Each time we conceived several months after we started trying. Our first three planned children were both our ideas, while she pressured me into having our youngest. She was in her late thirties and wanted one last child before it was too late, and eventually I agreed. She was conceived several months after we started trying, too.\n\n4. **Are you infertile?** I don't know. I've never had a fertility test done. But the fact that none of our planned children are mine makes me think that I might be. I will have a  fertility test as soon as possible.\n\n\n",

If she's still lying to you, in the face of overwhelming evidence, then there's nothing left to save.\n\nTalk to a lawyer about how to start the divorce process, and follow their advice to the letter.\n\nSit your youngest down and have an age-appropriate conversation with her.\n\nTell her that you and her mother will be getting a divorce. That it turns out that the other kids aren't your biological kids. That you still love them and are still their father, but you won't be able to stay married to their mother.\n\nThat she can have a DNA test done as well if she wants. But that she doesn't have to - you'll love her, and she'll be your daughter either way. She also doesn't have to decide that right now.\n\nThen take it one step at a time. Sort out the logistics of leaving, find yourself a new place and get yourself set up.\n\nFrom there, I'd start looking at ways to maintain your relationship with all of your children. With the youngest, make sure to get as much custody as you can (even full custody if that's possible). \n\nFor all of the children, try to come up with some traditions that everyone could enjoy. Maybe they all come over for dinner at your house once a month. Maybe there's a standing invitation for any of them to come over for Sunday lunch. Maybe you get together every so often and try something new together (pottery/kayaking/rock-climbing etc). Whatever will work with everyone's schedules. Make sure you keep in touch with each of them individually as well. Ask about how their lives are going. Offer to help them with projects they're doing - especially around the home. \n\nBe good to them and to yourself. And never badmouth their mother. I don't think you would, from what you've written, but try never to set them up in opposition to her. Or that they can't see her/treat her well if they want you to like them.\n\nYou'll be co-parenting with your soon-to-be-ex for the next several years, so make sure that's as easy as possible for everyone concerned.",

Leaving can be construed as abandoning the marriage which will work against you since you're a man. \n\nFrom my own divorce experience: When it comes to divorce, do NOT telegraph your plans or discuss them with your soon-to-be-ex-wife beyond what is absolutely necessary (i.e. what your lawyer tells you to do). This will only work against you. She's a liar and doesn't respect you and this means that she will treat you terribly in divorce proceedings; don't give her the upper hand.\n\nAlso, poison the well of lawyers. Search for top lawyers on [https://www.martindale.com/](https://www.martindale.com/) and then get consultations with the top-rated ones. Choose the one you like the best (e.g. you get along professionally, he explains things to you in layman's terms, you're on the same page about the kids, etc.). By paying for the hour-long consultation, they are now aware of the case and if she tries to hire them, it will create a conflict of interest. So, you will shrink the pool of lawyers she can choose from. This is good, because you get what you pay for with lawyers and getting a bad one will give you an upperhand. \n\nForget about being nice. This woman you're married to is about to become an evil monster and is going to come after you for everything and will attempt to destroy your life. Do not get lulled into thinking that she will be reasonable or loves you; she won't and she doesn't. Steel yourself for the horrors that about to come and do not tell her you lawyered up or are preparing for divorce. Let the subpoena do the talking.\n\nBest of luck.",

Just keep that up. They will need you.  You will need them.\n\n2. Your youngest will have questions and it's up to you when she's ready to hear the truth. This one sucks but you seem like an amazing dad and if your wife decides to lie, you may have to take her shit for awhile for your child's sake. Your other kids may defend you. The truth may come out.\n\n3. It would be a No from me unless she immediately confesses entirely and takes responsibility and apologizes. And agrees to therapy, both individual and couples. For me, I would need full access to her phones, her emails, everything. She's still lying to you right now with actual DNA proof in your hands...that's bullshit.\n\nAnything else, just ask. I would leave. She had multiple affairs and multiple children with multiple men and can't even own it when caught. But I never want to be like that person who just says leave. It's a lot.

As you and your other kids deal with this, keeping her ignorant of the truth is just going to push her to one side. And when you tell her later on, it's going to bring up all of that pain and confusion for you and everyone else all over again. It may open old wounds, and new ones for everyone. Telling her now gives her the chance to deal with this as part of the family. With the support she needs as you go through all of this together. \n\nIf she's not biologically related to you, then everything she thought was true is suddenly going to be a lie. Her mother lied to her, as she's lied to you all for so long. It's understandable that you want to protect your youngest, but adding to those lies is only going to cause her more pain in the long run. She deserves to know the truth, to make her own mind up. If you don't tell her, you are going to have to create a massive conspiracy of silence just to \"protect\" her. When she eventually finds out, she may think that you've done exactly as her mother has done, and she may not trust either of you then. She may think you've kept it quiet because you're scared to know the truth. That your relationship with her is only based on whether or not she's really yours. \n\nAnd that's assuming you succeed in keeping the truth from her. This is big. How is she going to feel if she finds out from someone else? Someone who might not tell her with kindness and reassurance? If you don't tell her now then you risk letting her find out the truth in the *worst* possible way. You're giving your wife the opportunity to tell her god knows what, and right now you don't know who your wife really is or what she's capable of. She's not the woman you thought you married. You need to protect your kids from your wife, not the truth. \n\n",

I honestly don't know if you should tell her now and if you should get more information and then let her know. Almost might be better to know the whole story first. But I can't imagine it will be easy to find out in your home without her knowing something is up. Either way, whether you tell her before or after, she needs to know very soon. ",

Just tell her honestly what\u2019s going on, HOWEVER, you need to be extra careful to not make your daughter feel unloved by you OR your wife. Because she still needs both of you and it is still important for her development to have both parents. So you also need to be careful not to accuse your wife or make your wife out to be the bad guy. You should probably avoid saying your wife cheated. Just say something to the effect of You\u2019re still the father just not DNA wise. And that you don\u2019t know how or why and that if she wants to know more she needs to ask her mom. I can\u2019t stress enough though that it\u2019s important to not make your daughter pick a side. When she\u2019s older and wiser, even if your wife lies and tries to turn her against you, your daughter will realize the truth of things and appreciate the maturity and care you had for her when she\u2019s older. From the way it sounds though in general you seem to have very close and good relationships with your kids. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do fine and handle it well.\nGood luck \ud83d\udc4d ",

That is not healthy and if it's that far gone then it will likely never recover and you will never truly trust that person ever again.

You really need to get your kids on board with you as well, especially the youngest. Often times the guilty party will try to manipulate the kids to either save the marriage or get the better slice of the pie during divorce hearings ",

The theory that she was trying to give him one of his own sounds more plausible. Does seem she wanted and planned the kids each time but the first, otherwise the timing wouldn't match up. It's kind of nuts to cheat while you are trying to conceive with your husband, but that seems to have been the case at least 3 times. Do wonder if there's some odd infertility thing that happened there but its pretty nuts regardless. ",

                                    "comment": "She individually persuaded my friends to do an intervention on me in my own home. She was attractive and the friends she recruited were very inexperienced in terms of relationships and totally enamoured by her and willing to 'whiteknight' for her when she used crocodile tears.\n\nShe had them host a surprise 'intervention' for me, in my own home, where they refused to leave and collectively told me I had psychosis. I lived with her and she wanted a relationship with me but I was not interested. She thought this would change if she persuaded me I had not heard her have the dozen or so one night stands and threesomes she had in the 3 months I lived with her, and that I had full blown hallucinations when I saw random shirtless men in my kitchen or living room some mornings. I never judged her or even acknowledged any of her conquests, it was her business.\n\nOn another occasion she persuaded them to barge past security in my workplace so that they could pull me out of the office in order to immediately section me in a mental institution. To this day I never have an adequate answer for why they needed to do this at my workplace since I lived with them so they could have done it before or after work. The real reason she did it was to make nowhere safe and keep increasing the intensity and pressure. We had not talked in weeks at this point as just wanted them to leave me alone, but they would not let up. They fucked up my early career. \n\nEventually I proved she was lying about me having psychosis and hallucinating by the use of another witness and a secret recording. Rather than backtracking my friends were far more furious at me. The fact I took a secret recording was evidence against my sanity more than proof of her lying. It proved she 'was mistaken' about some of the hallucinations but not all of them, they shouted. \n\nI permanently lost many of my closest friends.\n\nI might be gatekeeping but it angers me when people now call any lie 'gaslighting'. I was truly gaslighted and nobody who has not gone through it will ever understand. When everyone you know is telling you that you are insane over and over, shouting at you, opening your mail, waking you up in the night to tell you how disappointed they are in you, and so on - you start to truly feel paranoid. Friends you've not heard from in years get in touch, have a beer with you, then tell you how worried they are about you and you need help. Entire groups of people you know refuse to talk to you any more and you have no idea why they cut contact as you were good friends who went on holidays together. And your paranoia is used as evidence against you. If you show even a tiny bit of emotion like anger or upset then that is used as evidence against you. It is like being mentally raped, by your closest friends, for months on end. I still have therapy about it.\n\nMost people find it easier to believe I was insane than that any of this happened. I've talked about it online before and some people tell me to kill myself just for saying all of this; people viscerally reject that any of this is possible. Look at all the comments in this thread with excuses for the wife. Those people cant even believe that some women lie and cheat a lot! Some people assert that female psychopaths don't exist at all, only male ones do. \n\n You will not believe how persuasive a clinical psychopath can be. They have mastered the art of lying since age 3. It takes 10 years to be an expert in something. They will lie about things that nobody else could ever lie about, so nobody will believe its a lie as 'who would even lie about that?'. I noticed she could alter my memories by asking me to repeat what I saw then suggesting I saw something different. She would describe the new memory it as if it was always my own idea. She would describe vivid details like a red coat that wasn't there. She would say it so confidently with total eye contact. \n\nMy advice:\n* do not ignore your gut when your gut tells you somebody is lying.\n* do not trust people who tell you to ignore your gut and to listen to them, especially if you were a primary witness and they are not.\n* get everything in writing. if you see something important happen write it down in detail. \n* When someone demands you say what you saw when you saw them do something bad say 'I dont know what you mean'. If they demand over and over that you tell them what you saw keep repeating the line.",

Police will do this to a suspect in order to break down a person and their potential lies- this can sometimes lead to false confessions. \n\nSo let's say Chad saw this person steal $20 off their other roommate's nightstand. Chad would confront her, and she would ask what exactly he thought he saw. She would \"correct\" him with an explanation (\"oh, he owed me the money\"). OP would be resistant to believing this. She would ask again for OP to detail what he saw. She would \"correct\" him by changing details (\"no that wasn't a $20 bill, it was a green sticky note, you know John writes everything down on sticky notes\"). OP might be second guessing himself now. She asks again what he thinks he saw. She now admonishes him for suspecting her doing something as low down as stealing from a dear friend. Now OP thinks he must have misread the incident, feels embarrassed and so won't bring it up again. So now she got away with stealing $20 in plain sight, and doesn't have to worry about being outed.

            "comment": "&gt;How do I handle my youngest daughter? I feel like our marriage is beyond saving, and I will need to tell my daughter something. I don't want her to know the truth until she's older, but I also don't want my wife lying and making me out to be the villain.\n\nI was a teenage girl just a couple of years ago. Tell her the truth. Teenagers are a lot more mature than adults give them credit for, and if there's one thing that will hurt her more it would be lying. Teenagers hate being lied to, just as much (if not more) than adults. She will find out eventually, and at that point will be dealing with the fact that her mother has betrayed her trust, as well as the rest of the family's. Don't let her feel that you've betrayed her too.\n\nThe information is out there now. Your other children know, and your wife knows it's no longer a secret. If you don't tell your daughter, you can't be sure that she will find out from you. That will make this situation even more of a disaster. Your wife has clearly been lying throughout the marriage, and when her lie comes out, it is very likely that she will blow up. You don't know what she's going to tell your youngest daughter, and you don't know that she is going to do it tactfully or honestly. \n\nTeenagers are strong. We trust them to decide what they want to do for the rest of their lives and whether or not they want to indebt themselves up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Especially teens today. \n\n\nMy parents split when I was 13. My mother was verbally and emotionally abusive and the divorce was not fun. The one thing that pissed me off more than anything else was lying or not being forthcoming with information from either of my parents, *because this effected me too*. Teens are at an important age where they are becoming their own person, and recognizing and demanding their own autonomy. Hiding something from them that effects them could very well damage your relationship with them. \n\nYour wife's cheating effects your children deeply. They should get to choose how they respond to being lied to their entire lives, even your youngest daughter. If your daughter finds out in the future, she very well may be extremely pissed at her mother for lying to her for her entire life. If **everyone** else knows but her, she will feel left in the dark and betrayed when she founds out. She may feel that you ALL lied to her. She may also have a hard time managing her reaction, because she could be resentful that the situation is \"over\" and feel as if she doesn't have the opportunity to respond to her feelings and must just move past them since everyone else already has.\n\n\nI really, really cannot advise enough to tell her the truth. \n\nETA: I just noticed your daughter is 14 from your title. She can absolutely handle this. And if she's anything like all the women I grew up with and know, she will *want* to deal with this rather than being lied to further. ",

Your wife can say whatever she wants, she cannot keep her lies wrapped up.\n\n3) No, you should not spend anytime with your wife. You need to lawyer up and divorce her. It might hurt now, but you will feel better down the road either alone or with a new partner. At least you do not have to live a lie with this woman anymore.",

I do notice from the ages that you were both teenagers when your first child was born and I'm guessing it was a rather quick/shotgun wedding? It's possible she married you out of panic, having got pregnant and not knowing what to do (or even who the father was?)\n\nI think you probably need to start going over your calendars and try to work out what was going on around their conceptions (eg were you on a business trip? Was your wife away?)\n\nIf you were both sexually active all these years, it's a bit odd that at least one kid didn't turn out to be yours. I think it's also worth going for a fertility check up yourself.\n\nThen I think you need to go with your wife, sit before a geneticist, and have them spell out the fact that she did not conceive these children with you. That may be sufficient for her to finally admit what did happen.\n\nI don't see how you can continue your marriage with this level of doubt and mystery.",

There is viable sperm but no vas deferens, hence medical assistance is needed. From this, he found out that none of his sons were his.\n\nSo if for some bizarre reason your wife suspected you were infertile, since you were trying but it wasn't happening, maybe she went to a sperm bank or something, thinking you wouldn't agree. But several times? It doesn't seem likely.\n\nDoes she work somewhere with hugely dodgy people who could have drugged and date-raped her, multiple times? Again, it seems the stuff of fiction.\n\nSo then we have to face the fact that she knowingly cheated with multiple partners over a period of at least a decade.\n\n&gt; Did she take our planning as an opportunity to have unprotected sex with her (otherwise protected) affairs?\n\nThis does seem the most likely answer. But how she thinks she can still get away with it now - well, I suppose she has nothing to lose by brazening it out.\n\nI do think you need to get repeat tests at a separate facility. There was a situation on here where a couple got a false negative, he threw her out, but she encouraged him to get a second test which was accurate/positive. So he was the father. (However it was too late - the marriage was over. It didn't help that he was the one who had had the affair, but had then treated her with suspicion for a year!)\n\nI'm so sorry this is happening to your family, it must be horribly traumatic for all of you.",

The percentage may be *slightly* lower due to spontaneous mutations or a Y chromosome. So, like 49.9% or better.\n\nA case of chimerism, where the sperm or the sample collected belonged to that of a fraternal twin absorbed in utero, could theoretically result in less, but it would predict the father was the child's uncle.

Not that I\u2019m saying this it right, because it\u2019s definitely not, but just that there might be some other situation that you would never think of. \n\nI\u2019m curious about OPs money situation. Is it possible his wife is the infertile one, and she was aware of this all along? Is it possible she had secretive fertility treatments? OP is it possible she was paying for fertility treatments without you knowing? She could have used a sperm donor every time she got pregnant, although I don\u2019t see why she would unless OP was infertile, and how would she know that....\n\nAnyways, all I\u2019m saying is with such a strange situation like this, I\u2019m curious as to if there isn\u2019t another explanation going on...other than his wife is a cheating whore who gets around the block a few times. \n\nEdit- can you do dna tests at another lab? I just remembered about another post a few years ago where this guy dna tested his newborn son. It came back negative on him being the father, so he resent samples, same result. He divorced his wife and during the court proceedings the court ordered a dna test using their lab, it came back positive and it turns out the lab he used was faulty. \n\nThe fact that your wife didn\u2019t even seem bothered by it also strikes me as strange. If she knew the kids weren\u2019t yours, she obviously would know for over 30 years now, and I would imagine that conversation would have gone a lot differently. ",

And it\u2019s reasonable to assume that she had something going on for some time after you were married. \n\nThen, what, she switched up to another guy?  I\u2019d definitely get another set of tests from a different lab (and insist on that, make sure the tests are not sent to the same place).  But realistically, this isn\u2019t what was going on.

The odds that the same teenager who impregnated her as a teen randomly donated sperm and that sperm just happened to be the sample used to impregnate her ... just not a possibility.  ",

But I\u2019m also not going to sugar coat things and say stay with her.\n\nI would like to point out that like you said those tests are accurate. They are very rarely wrong. And the fact she doesn\u2019t even want to talk about it or apologize or even confess has to make you wonder if she\u2019s cheating on you now.\n\nI\u2019d go get tested. Even if it was in the past, it\u2019s possible she\u2019s still cheating on you now. Stay safe. Document things. This might save you later. Your child is 14. It\u2019s a hard conversation to have but if you feel she\u2019s at an age where she\u2019s mature enough to handle the situation, you need to be the one to tell her and explain to her. Maybe even have a favorite sibling (if she has one) come along. It\u2019s much better that she knows the truth with evidence than her mom twists the truth around and brainwash her. \n\nIf you do go with divorce, the reason I say document is custody battles for kids. I don\u2019t know how she\u2019ll react but what if she tries to file for full custody of your youngest? DOCUMENT.\n\nIt\u2019s really up to you whether or not you either want to 1) forget all about this but live a life with her knowing she\u2019s cheated on you multiple times with little to no remorse apparently 2) confront her until she confesses but possibly still stay with her in a possibly broken marriage 3) maybe couples counseling if you\u2019re really up for it 4) divorce\n\nI\u2019m going to be real here. I hope you don\u2019t stay with her because you feel like you\u2019re too old to move on with your life. You are never ever too old for anything. You shouldn\u2019t settle for someone who obviously cared (possibly cares) very little for your feelings and wellbeing. You deserve more. You are not responsible for your wife or her despicable affairs. She chose what she chose to do and that is not your fault. She did this to herself. Staying in an unhappy and broken relationship because you feel like you\u2019ve invested so much into it is not the answer. It will hurt you in the long run and you won\u2019t be happy and you deserve so much more. Right now your priority isn\u2019t her but you and your kids who from the sound of it, know you love them which shows you\u2019re an amazing parent already. Just keep doing what you\u2019re doing. Don\u2019t let that mindset that because you spent half of your life with her means you\u2019re stuck with her forever because you\u2019re not. You\u2019re not too old to go out and explore or find someone new or just live life. Do what you think is the best for you. ",

I\u2019m considering new work, new places to live. It\u2019s an opportunity for me to grow as a person and enjoy life. \n\nWhatever happens, you will get through it, and you have children that love you and will support you. ",

Even if they aren\u2019t biologically yours, you raised them and they consider you their father as much as you consider them your children. \n\nAs for saving the marriage, there\u2019s nothing a stranger on the internet can really say to that. Obviously the gut reaction is to leave immediately but human relationships can be complex. However, if she can\u2019t admit to the cheating or explain herself then I can\u2019t imagine how the relationship would continue. Humans are adaptable creatures and it sounds like you have 5 kids who will love and support you no matter your decision. ",

In my state, DNA is irrelevant - a woman's husband is the legal father of a baby born during the marriage, even in the face of DNA and even if the wife identifies the biological father and he acknowledges it. So what I'm saying is that this may not affect your legal rights to your youngest, if that's a concern for you on pursuing divorce.\n\nBut before you get that far - you honestly seem like an amazing person. I hope you find a balance to  take care of yourself in all this. Make an appointment with a marriage counselor. Tell your wife of the date and time, and this is her opportunity to come and explain in a safe environment why the DNA tests don't match. Keep an open mind about donors. Tell her if she does not show, it is her indication that she does not want to be honest, and that you know you deserve honesty from other people. Assure her that it doesn't affect your relationship with the kids, but that it does affect how you view her if she cant be honest.",

The only other alternative is she just had a very shallow cheating fetish and kept doing it 4, probably 5 times (if your youngest isn't yours or you find out you're infertile).\n\nYou probably already figured it out, though, that if the two oldest share the same father and she got pregnant at first during college, then it was probably a high school or college friend she knew back then for at least a couple years.

Even if they feel some type of way right now, they will see that you haven\u2019t changed your love for them by continuing to treat them the way you always have. It seems though that they are being supportive and do not seem to question your love for them.\n\n2. I think you need to get some stuff sorted out first before telling your youngest daughter. See below.\n\n3. Since your wife seems to think the tests are flawed, ask her to do a DNA test for her kids. And then retake it with her. If she refuses I think you know your answer. If I truly thought these tests were flawed and I did not cheat on my husband I would be doing everything that I could to prove it. I would then suggest going to therapy with her to help figure out where to go from here. If she STILL refuses I would go to your youngest daughter and carefully explain the situation. Get a DNA test. And get a divorce.\n\nSomeone that is innocent would be completely alarmed at these DNA results. Someone that is innocent would prove their innocence. ANYTHING to prove their innocence.\n\nSomeone that is guilty would try to avoid the conversation. Someone that is guilty is going to try to turn it on you. Someone that is guilty would avoid therapy. Someone that is guilty is going to gaslight you. ",

    "postText": "I have been taking to this girl for almost a year now and have liked her ever since I met her. She\u2019s also admitted to liking me back in the past about 3 times now but has said that the feelings subsided in about a week or two after she feels them though I haven\u2019t stopped liking her even through other relationships. But this weekend she had texted a group with a bunch of people including me that she is meeting up with a guy she has been talking to this Saturday. And after that I was completely destroyed and I\u2019ve been feeling horrible ever since. But the worst part is I feel like if I do tell her how I feel she will get confused feelings and seclude herself like she has done before with others. I have no idea what to do and I feel lost and confused. What would you do in my situation?",

You probably took too long to make a move (since you had one year) and this is what happens in these cases. \n\nWait patiently until you hear how it went with that guy and if it didn\u2019t work out now you make a serious move. It\u2019s about patience and speed.",

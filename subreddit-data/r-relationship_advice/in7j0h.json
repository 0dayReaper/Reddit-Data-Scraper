    "postText": "A month ago, my wife gave birth to a black baby girl. We're both white, so she was forced to admit that the child was a result of a one night stand last year. \n\nI've started divorce proceedings, although we're still living together for now. Between our two boys(aged 2 and 4, I've had paternity tests for them and they came back positive), her infant daughter and her having lost her job due to COVID, living together as amicably as possible until the divorce is settled is an unfortunate necessity.\n\nNaturally I have no ill will towards the baby, and I've been disgusted by some of the comments I've heard from family members, friends, coworkers and others, all who seem to be fixated on the racial angle of this. As if the most salient part of this isn't that my wife cheated, but that she cheated with a BLACK man and that the baby is BLACK.\n\nWhat really worries me is that my two sons might pick up on these narratives. They're too young to really understand what's happening now, but I'm worried that as they grow to understand the situation that they might grow to resent their half-sister for \"breaking up their parents marriage\". And worse that their resentment might express itself in a racist fashion, under the influence of the aforementioned racist narratives.\n\nAny thoughts on how I should try to influence my son's away from that perspective? It probably doesn't help that we live in a suburb with very few black people and their half-sister is really the only black person my children know.",

My brother wasn\u2019t the product of infidelity or anything, he\u2019s just my half brother. My stepdads son. But I didn\u2019t know for a while because my dad brought him along to the museums, and the water parks, and the movies, etc. pretty much anytime I was at his place, my little brother was too, and he never complained. He loved my brother. So that\u2019s an option. You can have the baby come with your sons occasionally, make sure they\u2019re treating her okay, and be an example for his to treat their sister.",

When my brother and I were little we lived in an all black neighborhood in Philly and my mom had a talk with me about sticking up for any friends who might encounter some racists. I remember not knowing what she was talking about at the time because there were no other white kids around besides us, but when we moved to the suburbs we definitely encountered some assholes as we got into our teens. Then I knew what my mom's talk was all about. But I think even regardless of having a specific talk about encountering racists, they'll kind of just know how ridiculous racism is if they grow up with a sibling who isn't the same race as them. Kids have to learn racism it isn't natural.",

My mom sent me to catholic school out of the neighborhood for a better education (what a joke that turned out to be) where all the kids happened to be white.

Have family events together. You attend her 1st birthday party, not just drop off the kids. Have her some weekends and take her on holidays with you when she's older. \nIt's your wife that did you wrong, not this baby. Like I said though, it will be hard, but your kids will see a united family.",

They'd never admit it though. \n\nAlso, it's tangential but as a non-American the remnants of the 'one drop rule' in modern day US society are so surprising to me. OP talks about how this is a 'black' baby when the kid is equally as white as she is black. But rather than mixed, she is called black completely erasing her white side. Not pertinent to the post but odd to me nonetheless.",

Probably not, though he's as white as he is black, genetically.\n\nUnfortunately for racists there are only two racial distinctions that matter - white, and not white, and that way of seeing the world has very much seeped into the rest of American culture.\n\nThe sad reality of the situation is that, like Obama, quite a few people in this girl's life will see her and treat her as a member of the 'not white' category; she'll never have any legitimate chance of associating with both sides of herself equally.\n\n*Edit, to reply to the comment below while the post is locked.\nThe light implication that 'white' and 'non-white' as a fair description for all racism was unintentional; rather that's how I describe the most common type of American racism. Racists, in order to give themselves an unearned feeling of superiority, must define an in-group and an out-group with race being the determining distinction, and racists around the world and through history have come up with countless ways to group themselves separately from others. My thinking, in the previous assertions, was limited to America's most prominent form of racism and should have been labeled more clearly.\n\nObama was unquestionably the first Black President of the US - when people say that, however, they aren't necessarily talking about genetics. Obama has lived his life as a Black man because that's how people have labeled and treated him, there's nothing he could have ever done to live life as a White man that society would have accepted. Obama found success in life while fighting against all of the disadvantages being considered Black brings but without the meaningful advantages of being White, giving him full claim to the title of being the first Black President. Ideas of racial genetic purity are nonsense to being with - race is perception, and Obama succeeded with that perception stacked against him.",

My wife and I were seperated, she dated a man and he abandoned her when she got pregnant.  \n\n\nI took the little girl that resulted as my daughter.   \n\n\nThis is your children's sister. She is blood to them.   \n\n\nYou don't have to go the route I did, but I want you to know, everything you say can and will affect those kids and how they see their sister. Don't talk badly about your ex. Don't talk badly about their sister  \n\n\nDon't reject their sister. If you're taking your kids to the movies, offer to take their sister. Why? Because that's their sister and they will love her unconditionally. Show them that's right to do.   \n\n\nMy family was not allowed to talk badly about my ex. Period. I do not talk badly about my ex. They know if they do I will cut them off from my children. Little ears hear everything.  \n\n\nI was lucky, my family accepts my youngest whole heartedly and without reservation.   \n\n\nYour ex is their mother. That little girl it their sister.",

You're assumed to be the heir if they die, the go-to if they get sick, and the parent of the baby if a birth happens. Getting married makes it easy for couples because they don't need to file these documents (will, POA, paternity) separately. They file the marriage license instead and that includes giving their partner all those rights, powers, and responsibilities that they'd otherwise need to file separately for. If they don't want one of those rights or responsibilities, they have to \"opt out\" instead. \n\nGetting married is an automatic opt-in to all of that and you have to specifically opt out if you don't want to be the father, don't want them to inherit your stuff, don't want them to be your medical decision maker, etc. OP had the option to opt out of being the kids dad, but he has to do it quickly because after a certain amount of time, his window to opt out closes, the court is going to assume he's the father, and they're not going to take away a father from a kid after *x* months just because there's no biological tie (because at that point they assume separation would harm the child).",

            "comment": "OOF my dude.  Shits rough.  Right now you have a really good racist asshole detector in that young lady.  Since she is likely going to face racism her entire life, I think its your job and your ex wifes job, to make it clear any comments regarding race are going to be loudly and publicly called out.  You will have to have a zero tolerance policy for racism and you are now going to have to clearly and constantly call it out, forever.\n\nGotta set the example for your boys and for the little lady that racism has no place in this family.  \n\nThe boys cant be influenced by racist undertones if you don't fucking tolerate racist undertones.  Kids don't care about race, they learn about it from racists.  So you are going to have to cut a lot of people out of your life, because you are about to learn how many closet racists you are friends and family with, and you NO LONGER get to be friends or family with those people moving forward.\n\nThe only way its going to affect your family is if you and your ex allow it to.  It will never be because they heard someone be racist, it will be because they heard someone be racist and you didn't do anything about it.  Thats how they will learn that.\n\nAlso, I am a co-parent of a cheating exwife as well bud, Its been a decade, he will never know she cheated on me, why would he need to know that?  How would your boys ever know your family was \"Broken up\" if thats not the narrative you present to them.\n\nMy ex didn't cheat on my son, she cheated on me, she is a good mom, she loves the kid, so he will never need to know why we didn't stay together, its irrelevant.  \n\nAll of my family knows they don't ever get to say shit, because I made it clear I am not a shit slinging asshole.  The kid comes first, and that means my ex and I are a united front, and co-parents.  So no one will be saying a negative thing about my kids mom.  We had our issues and we split and the reason is no ones business.\n\nI cut out ANY family and friends that spoke ill of his mother.  ZERO TOLERANCE.  \n\nThe kids should never pay a price for your wifes mistakes.  If you co parent properly there is no issues with the kid.  Like I said we split when he was 2, he is almost 11 now and he is a well adjusted kid who knows both is parents love him, we just aren't together.  \n\nHe will never know she cheated, its irrelevant.  Same with your situation.  When they get older will they put 2 and 2 together?  Maybe, but you don't have to go into detail about it.  \n\nIn the end like I said, the only way your kids will be influence by racism is if you tolerate racism.  If you ONLY call out racist comments, and racist attitudes and show your kids that shit isn't ok, then they are never going to think its ok.\n\nSo you are gonna lose a few friends, and maybe family and they will be racists and not worthwhile anyways.  Your ex and you have to deal with shit a couple white folks usually ignore and don't deal with and you don't get to do that anymore.  Now you have to be vocal allies and call it out EVERYTIME and set that example.",

Tell her what the deal is. Tell her how nuclear you're willing to go if someone starts acting racist about this. Tell her you know *she's* not racist, but the rest of the family needs to get on board or fuck right off, and now is the time to decide. \n\nHonestly, every family has an Aunt Martha, find yours and use her. Older methods than facebook, and sometimes better. The old lady gossip chain. Use it. \n\nMy family has a secret that was handed down and hidden from kids for generations. It got handled, you found out if you needed to know for medical reasons or something. Now it's generations later it's all out, but the people who would have been hurt by it are dead so it doesn't matter. \n\nDo it like we did: get the old gossips on your side, use the old lady grapevine, and as /u/Mindtaker said, no second chances. Someone spouts some racist shit in your fb feed, they're out. Done. Cut them off. \n\nYou're right that protecting the kids is the goal here, and you're going to have to work at it. good luck man.",

So here it is again:\n\nSo this is a little bit of a story: My great grandfather was convicted of murder and executed in Kentucky. He had three kids at the time.\n\nThen my great grandmother moved to Oklahoma and re-married, and had two more kids.\n\nMy grandfather was one of the first three kids. One of my 'cousins' I'm pretty close with grandfather is one of the Oklahoma kids.\n\nBut a long standing family legend is that great grandpappy Jim actually was never executed, and got to Oklahoma and re-married his 'widow.' So a few years ago our grandfathers had genetic testing done, and they're full siblings. I'm not sure what company they used, 23 and me or some other.\n\nSo apparently my great grandfather did indeed kill a man, escape execution somehow, and re-married his own widow. He lived to be 98, I met him once when I was two. \n\nIt was a long standing family secret, and only came out because he carried a kind of dangerous recessive gene and the kids and grandkids eventually needed to know about it for health care reasons. But no one ever talked about it until he and his wife and all her sisters were dead, it was this huge family secret they all whispered about and never said out loud, apparently.",

This stops most people before they even start. Don\u2019t get ahead of yourself. Start simple. Like I said, start a personal journal. Just write down your thoughts semi-regularly to build the habit. Don\u2019t worry about perfection, or grammar, or even what you think would be clear to others. Just write. Anything. Do that and don\u2019t worry about anything else. Next steps come if and when they should. Even if you never show a single soul your writing, the journal is excellent for keeping memories and just having that outlet (it can actually be great for mental health if it\u2019s something you enjoy). There\u2019s no downside and tons of potential upside! Try it out. And if you ever land on something you feel you want to share, feel free to contact me.

My parents split based on ideological differences and it just really didn\u2019t get too much better. They love us so much but sometimes they let shit from their divorce slip out. They would use me as ammunition at the other parent. For example my mom said she wanted to work on things so my dad told me she had already asked him to move out. So I went back to her and used that to hurt her. I\u2019m not even making sense in this comment but I wish my parents were more like you. They are good people and I love them, but sometimes I wish they didn\u2019t feel as comfortable talking about their problems with the other parent as they do. My dad let it slip that my mom pulled a knife on him (?). My mom let it slip that he screamed at her and said he\u2019d take us away from her(?). Do I know if these things are true? No. But I do know more about the toxicity in my family that I didn\u2019t need to know. These were adult issues. Meanwhile when they were divorcing... before even telling me, they separated in the house and wouldn\u2019t talk to each other in front of me. They basically lived on ice for the three years it took for them to get divorced. Two of which I spent not knowing what was happening. It took me a long time to understand that they are human and make shitty decisions and were wrong for doing this. But I really really wish they hadn\u2019t made some of the decisions that they did. \n\nThe hardest part of this for me was that never, never, never have they ever sat down with me at the same time to talk about any of it. I\u2019m sorry this doesn\u2019t make sense I don\u2019t know something about your comment really just hit me hard.",

But I handled the divorce differently then many, I have no interest in being with someone who doesn't want to be with me.\n\nSo I never hated her or even really got upset.  The opposite of love isn't hate, indifference is.  I nothinged my ex wife the day I caught her.  (No real word I can't think of to describe it.)\n\nSure it was irresponsible and cruel of her,  but she clearly wasn't happy and didn't have the courage to face that problem head on, im not going to hold it against someone.  I would if I was angry about it, but I just can't see the point in getting angry about it.  I'm not going to give someone who cheats on me that level of power over my emotions and feelings.\n\nSo for me it was clinical.  We have to be good parent's l, her mistake only affected me if we co-parent properly, so no real harm done.\n\nI got remarried to an amazing woman and step mother to my kid.  My ex found a new husband more her style.  Now my kid has 4 parents that love him and support him at all his events and birthdays.\n\nReally its a best case scenario.  No ones in an unhappy marriage, kid has 2 examples of a loving marriage to see on the regular.\n\nAll in all this was better for everyone.",

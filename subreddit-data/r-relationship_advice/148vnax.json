    "postText": "\n\nTLDR: MIL tells me I\u2019m under performing in life because I dropped out of medical school and now work in healthcare administration.\n\nSo my soon to be MIL (will be in about 8 months) will not say hurtful comments to my face - she use to, but I stood up for myself and she started arguing and was very upset with me although I tired to stay calm and collected to remember what I believe I\u2019m worth and not give into her hurtful comments and let my self worth decline.\nAnyways, the other day my SO told me that she made a comment about me not finishing school and being in student loan debt and not working in the field my degree was in. I was immediately pretty pissed, but I tried to keep calm and just think through the problem - I reminded myself I actually do work in the field I went to school for - not as a primary care provider, but as an administrator in the largest hospital in my state. I grew up with a mother and father that were largely absent and when they were around they were fairly emotionally and physically abusive - I try to remind myself I\u2019m doing way more than I was ever expected to accomplish and that keeps my spirits up.\nI guess I\u2019m just kind of worried in a sense that my partners mom will never respect me because I can\u2019t find common ground with her. I know she just wants her daughter (my partner) to be happy and be taken care of, but I think about her disrespect and how that might affect me and our future children (hopefully will be around one day) my partner told me that she approached her mom and said those comments were very much not okay and that she has no right to talk about me that way because she doesn\u2019t know any part of my story.\nI don\u2019t feel the need to justify myself, but sometimes I wonder if tell her where I come from would help her understand and might make her more empathetic.. I\u2019m extremely grateful my partner stood up for me when I was not there to do so for myself but I don\u2019t really know what I should do to \u201cprove my worth\u201d to my partners mother (note: my partner is very supportive of me and has been with me since I started in a very low career position after dropping out of medical school - she stands up for me, but at the end of the day I know if push comes to shove, at least 8/10 times her loyalty sits with her parents and I am slightly afraid of it came to a point where she had to choose me or them it would be them; although I may be doom thinking - this may never be a problem we face)",

The only thing she\u2019s gonna understand is hard and harsh boundaries. When you set them, she\u2019s gonna be a very unkind human being. Just walk away from her. She\u2019s and her abysmal attitude are not your problem, nor will they ever be.",

Your partner should have established significantly more firm and strict boundaries with how their mother speaks to you and about you.\n\nIf your partner can\u2019t set these boundaries and can\u2019t place an ultimatum on their mom to respect those boundaries, then I\u2019m sorry but you gotta go. It only gets worse and this would completely mean that your partner does not have you and their life with you as their main priority",

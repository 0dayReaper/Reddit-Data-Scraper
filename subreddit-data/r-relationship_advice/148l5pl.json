    "postText": "I know the majority of relationship postings on this sub tend to be romantic based ones, but it's been a struggle to find an audience big enough to get a varied amount of views on the topic of family relationships.\n\n  \nMy parents raised me in a very fundamentalist, christian household and we attended a high control church. While I admittedly had a very comfortable childhood for the most part and enjoyed the benefits of having a greater community around me at all times... this naturally became more difficult to sustain as I matured and began to understand the principles and belief system of the church I was attending and started to feel uncomfortable there. I foolishly leaned into peer pressure about committing to it (the commitment is similar to JW baptism) and became a full fledged member despite my better judgement. 8 years later, I left the group after moving out of my parents house at 26. The church held a meeting to officially chuck me out this past year. Apparently I made it easy for them (apparently) by moving in with my boyfriend of (now) 2.5 years.\n\n  \nNow, my relationship with my parents has always been one marked by authoritarian rule. While my parents were loving, they were not overly affectionate or patiently understanding. I remember my mom used to mock parents who appeared (to her) to be trying to \"befriend\" their kid, whereas I silently wished my mom wanted to be my friend. I never felt comfortable confiding in them about mistakes and ultimately became a kid who told white lies and constantly hid information to maintain a veneer and I was not good at it. I was very terrified of confrontation, I had abandonment issues and was fearful of not being accepted by my peers. This resulted in me being \"difficult\" in high school and rebelling against their rules a lot. While my teachers and friends regarded me as someone who was personable and creative, my parents constantly reminded me about how 'contrary' and 'frustrating' i was for them. When I finally moved out of the home at 26 it was met with GREAT resistance. My parents thought i'd end up on a slippery slope to hell and my mom had a full blown tantrum when she discovered I'd secretly moved my essentials out of the house before telling them (this was just in case they decided to lock me out). Eventually they came around to the idea and helped me move in and it was one of my favourite memories. They took me shopping for things and it was one of the few times in our relationship where I felt they supported a decision that I had made.\n\n  \nDespite the little glimmer of hope in helping me move in, the relationship continued to feel strained. They invited me over on a weekly basis for dinner, which 80% of the time I attended. But slowly I could sense the gap in our relationship growing as they started to mount pressure on me about my on/off attendance at their church. When covid hit, all religious services were temporarily suspended and It was actually a chance for me to get some therapy and cut myself off completely (in a psychological sense) from returning to that place. As restrictions lifted, I had made some new friends and re-connected with old school friends which was improving my mental health. I decided to pay a visit to my best friend from school who lived across the country. I asked my parents if they were celebrating thanksgiving and as per usual, they gave a vague and non commital answer so I booked a plane ticket to visit her. At this point I was 29.  \nThat trip I took to see my friend sealed my fate. They were furious I had left without telling them (even though I knew they'd kick up a fuss if I did due to my friend being a 'worldly' person). They proceeded to host thanksgiving without me and from that point onward I have not been invited or included in any family gatherings for 2 years now. Once the church officially shunned me, it managed to get even worse where they wouldn't even keep me up to date with serious news like a family friend dying, or pictures of my new niece. I worked up the courage at one point to tell my dad about my boyfriend and his response was \"do you think i'm stupid, of course we know you have a boyfriend. If you think we are going to have anything to do with you dating an unbeliever you can dream on!\" and he walked away while I was sobbing and telling him that I was sorry and still loved him and mom. Which makes me cringe considering I was 30 at the time and clearly quite co-dependant and meek.\n\n  \n**TL;DR I'm now turning 32 and my boyfriend and I (he's amazing) are ring shopping. Life feels bittersweet. I am so incredibly happy with my new friends and my partner and the fact that I no longer have this pervasive, almost chronic depression anymore. But on the other side of that joy is a deep pain and vacancy in my heart about not having a mom and dad who even like me, let alone love me.** Things are so bad between us that I doubt they would put aside their pride to help me if I had a health crisis.\n\n  \nOf course, they blame me for the distance despite the fact I have made efforts to reconnect and been angrily shut down. They say I'm willful and rebellious and a 'nightmare' for them and seem to be telling others that its me who abandoned them and went down a morally corrupt route. I've spoken to pastors and ministers who seem uncomfortable and unsupportive of my parents views, I've mostly lost interest in church but attend periodically on holidays. It bothered me today because I heard they were shopping for my siblings birthday and something about that just made me feel really garbage considering they haven't celebrated or acknowledged my birthday in two years, and before that (while things were tense) they stopped gift giving because we were all \"too old for that\", but now that I'm out of the picture they've picked up those things again and it just f\\*cking sucks that's all.",

Not one ghost of a chance.\n\nYour parents' behavior is simply not natural. I am so sorry that they have been brainwashed by their cult (and it IS a cult) to such an extent that they would reject the flesh of their own flesh. I can't imagine how much that hurts. But please know that this reflects on THEM, and not in the least on you.

I would be so over the moon to raise a child, even just being an aunt, or a pet owner fills me with joy and satisfaction. Knowing how I feel about parenthood and how it doesn't line up with my parents perspectives on having children leaves me in a position where i'm almost floundering. Ever since I was a tiny kid I would ask myself \"why am i not enough to be loved in the way those kids are loved by their parents\"... don't get me wrong. I was WELL looked after on the surface, but I definitely do not have any trust or faith that my parents would fight for me. Especially knowing that i've already lost the battle between me and the church. \n\nThanks for your kind words. I will put that \"to thine own self be true\" in my phone as a daily reminder.",

Wouldn't loving parents want you to be happy? Wouldn't loving parents want you to have a partner who cares for you?\n\nI completely understand the pain of cutting out a parent and wishing desperately that it didn't have to be that way. I have done this with my dad. My therapist once told me something that really helped when I was agonizing over him disappointing me for the umpteenth time.\n\n\"What you want is for your father *to have loved you.* That didn't happen, so what do you want from your relationship now?\"\n\nThat really helped me realize that I was trying to retcon my childhood to make him a good father instead of accepting who he actually was. What you want is for your parents *to have loved you unconditionally*. They didn't, so now you have to decide how many times you're willing to be disappointed before you let them go for good.",

But it really does reflect the pain of my inner child... wanting so bad to be approved of, or worthy of ongoing and unrelenting love and affection. I have these moments where my dad was a great and tender person, but those moments were marred by his own prideful need to be the MOST pious and the MOST spiritual and it often hurt to hear about how the spiritual family (AKA church) supersedes the blood family. \n\nIt is definitely a difficult thing to ponder, but in order to move forward, difficult boundaries and decisions will have to be made.

My parents are still of the faith but dont attend any churches. My sister and I now identify as agnostic, and my parents (who know) love us just the same. We all escaped, and I don't think my story is common, unfortunately.\n\nI also want to say that it is NEVER a child's responsibility to please the parent. The responsibility to care for and love a child is 100% on the parents who decided to carry a pregnancy to term and keep the child.\n\nUnless they found out you were some kind of serial killer, rapist, or something equally heinous...there is no reason they should not love you other than the fact they are detached, deluded,and brainwashed at best.

It's about keeping a tight leash on their followers with a real consequence to fear.\n\nIt also pushes them out of their community of family and friendship and their support system with the idea that they'd be so lonely and miss that connection that they'd be willing to come back and follow the rules.\n\nSometimes too they believe in this afterlife path so much that they give up on people they believe won't come with them. It's not you hun, it's them and their belief system.",

It sounds like your parents love and affection was conditional as long as you did what they say. No one could live like that and be a functional adult. You\u2019ve tried and that\u2019s all you can do. Don\u2019t be disappointed be happy. You are about to get married and eventually start your own family. When that day come I guarantee they will want to meet they potential grandchild. You got time on your side.",

This part of your response caused my stomach to flip flop a little bit in discomfort because, while I do actually believe this to be true, I do have some unresolved issues around death and I get very VERY anxious when my loved ones fall ill. So I actually have an, almost irrational, fear that my parents will die before I get the chance to resolve our estrangement. In my very early twenties my best friend (she was in the church) died quite suddenly after a short and ferocious fight against a brain tumour, and then shortly after that a close family member elected to end their own life. Those two years shaped my twenties in a powerful, but also anxiety riddled way.\n\nI know that my parents are aware of the panic I have around health and losing loved ones and they have made mention of \"not knowing how long they have\" in an effort to get me, and my siblings to fall into line.\n\nI should definitely get more help with that as I don't think I'm going to be able to show up 100% in my relationship if I am living under a constant dark cloud of anxiety about my parents dying suddenly and randomly.",

Family has always been a core value of mine and while I am so thrilled to have the chance to start my own family, I have to make sure that I fully understand that my parents are fully responsible to meet me in the middle and that I can't do anything about it if they opt out of that.",

I do grieve the loss of that relationship to this day, but I recognize that he\u2019s the one who broke it. He wanted me to make myself small so he could feel bigger. To remain connected to him would mean I had to cut off all the parts of myself that made me who I am and I decided it wasn\u2019t worth it. Absolving myself of that responsibility lifted a huge weight off my shoulders.\n\nPlease check out the book Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents; it helped me a lot and I think you might find it helpful too.",

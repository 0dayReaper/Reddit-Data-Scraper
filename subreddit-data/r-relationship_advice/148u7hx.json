    "postText": "So there's this girl who likes me and I like her, but I can't bother the thought of why even bother being in a relationship where there is a possibility she will cheat on me, and if she leaves me I will %100 be depressed, statistically in our young age we won't even make it to be married together, and even more statistically if we do get married %50 of marriages end in a divorce, so what's the point of this whole thing where in the end I will end depressed from it, what's the point? I ofc don\u2019t want to lead her on and not know what i want, I just want someone to change my mind",

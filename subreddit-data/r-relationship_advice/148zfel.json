    "postText": "My (32f) husband (31m) recently just flipped a switch. He's suddenly extremely unhappy. And in the past month he's left three times and come back. He says he's depressed...hates his job, weight gain, but mostly unhappy in our marriage. We're in marriage counseling. And I'm in individual counseling. It's helping me a lot with anger, past trauma, etc. He has an appointment to get set up with counseling tomorrow morning. But I don't know what to really do here. He says I need to be patient and understanding while he works through this. And I have no problem being patient, understanding, and supportive. But he keeps changing his mind rather rapidly. One day we're having sex and he loves me and wants to work it out no matter what. And the next he wants to leave and says it's hopeless and he sees only being coparents with me in the future. We have two children (4 year old boy and 8 month girl). It just feels like he's really messing with my head and it hurts. I want us to work through this and be a family but I'm at a total loss here. What would you do if you were me?",

    "postText": "\nI'm in a situationship w him and idk if I should be doing this because ..yes we have good times together where we work, eat, sleep tog..have a lot of intimacy, crackling chemistry and all of that ...but there's no scope for a future. he claims to have fallen in love w me.the other day he said \"there's a part of me that loves u and there's a part of u that loves me but obviously u aren't in love love\"\n.I do have deep feelings for him and that scares me . he gets a bit insecure when I'm spending time w other Bois he knows are interested in me. he seems very hot and cold at times. he initiated dates etc, and may even have asked me to date him. I'm just a bit scared of getting heartbroken once all this ends. which is Smtg he understands. idk should I just take my space from him and keep my distance or should I let this continue....???",

How do you think he\u2019ll react if you told him you don\u2019t want to do this anymore? Does he get angry?  How long have you two been seeing each other? Are you comfortable leaving your job if he becomes obsessive?\n\nEdited to add: are you into him? Are you in love with him?",

I have v strong feelings for him. I'm just trying to hold myself back if that makes any sense",

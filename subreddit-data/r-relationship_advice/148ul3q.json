    "postText": "So basically we live in two different states. After our last fight around two months ago, she broke up. I then went to her city to apologise, try to get her back, but she didn\u2019t. The thing is that she did make out with me, but was rude all along. Then after a month of no contact, I again went to meet her, on this Saturday. First she refused to meet me, but then calls me to her house. Again I apologised, wrote a long ass letter, tried my level best to convince her, then she makes out, says that I don\u2019t have the same feelings for you anymore, then after repeatedly trying to convince her, she says that we both should move on without any expectations, and then if I feel like coming back, I will. Just give it some time. \n\nBut when she was asleep, I had a hunch that something was amiss. I went through her phone, she had gone on a date with some one else and is kinda roaming around with another office colleague of hers. I was legit heartbroken. \n\nSo I then ask her about these two guys. She goes on to say that one of them is a friend, and she kinda liked the other guy, and when she, her Flatmate and the other guy had gone clubbing, and when her Flatmate and the other guy started to dance with each other, she got jealous. So she realised that she kinda likes him, and the guy calls her to have some ice cream, she thought of it as it might be a date, but the guy just called her to have an ice cream. This is what she said.\n\nAnd she legit starts going full ballistic on me, as who am I to question her, who am I to even check her phone, I apologise and get out of her house. \nThen she says that she won\u2019t ever come back. \n\nInitially she had unlocked me, but now she has again blocked me from everywhere. \n\nWill she come back? What\u2019s the scenario now? Why did she make out with me, kiss me etc, even if she didn\u2019t want to come back?",

She knew you didn't have the strength to fully block her first so she used you to make out and stuff when she felt like it. \n\nYou fucked up going through her phone. She is your ex. Her life is absolutely not your business.\n\nThis is totally over and thank goodness cauae you both need to grow up. Don't chase ex's after a break up. In fact, don't chase anyone. If you have to convince slmeone to be with you, they're not the one for you.",

    "postText": "Hi all,\nThis may be long as I it highlights most of my life with my father.. me (25), my sister (27S) and brother (23m) with my dad &amp; his family. \n\n\nSo some back story: my dad and mom split up when I was 3, my youngest brother being 1 and oldest sister being 5. They split up due to my father having an affair &amp; suffering from alcoholism. He is now married to the women he had an affair with. For anonymity, let\u2019s say he is named Eric and she is named Nicole. Nicole had 3 kids prior to them getting together. (Although we see them as our siblings and nothing less, to avoid confusion I will be referring as step-siblings) Nicole\u2019s children are the same ages as us basically (24f, 26m &amp; 27m)\nMy siblings &amp; I have been in contact with my father since we were born, and with our step siblings since Eric &amp; Nicole have been together. \nMy siblings let\u2019s say (anonymity) Morgan &amp; Nicolas have always felt the way I feel and we have had countless memories of the abuse and neglect we\u2019ve endured.\n\nWhen we\u2019re just wee babies and my parents split up, we had to visit twice a month. We were always locked away and anytime we were not locked away (literally in a room with nothing in it) we were alone &amp; there were locks on the fridge, pantry and the water was always turned off. We experienced this until my oldest sister, Morgan was about 14. So roughly 9 years\u2026 only reason why it stopped was that my sister said something to my mom. My mom threatened to not allow us to go back if we weren\u2019t being properly cared for. And they \u201cadjusted\u201d.. this is not all of it, I was shot with BB guns where I\u2019d bruise and bleed, and there was a lot more\u2026\n\nEric &amp; Nicole have been together since I was 3 and are still together. So everyone from her family and his family have pretty much known us before we could speak clearly. \nWe have done absolutely nothing that would be considered rude, shameful or disrespectful to any of their family members or our step siblings. But for some reason we are never treated as family.\n\nWe are constantly being excluded from events, random occasions and serious information. For example, my dad had a birthday dinner at a restaurant, we were invited. However, the 3 of us (Morgan &amp; Nicolas) were seated at a separate table than my father, family &amp; his FRIENDS. Another time, we found out by our step brother\u2019s FRIEND, that my father was having a family sunday BBQ to celebrate family day  and he was asking if we would be there (father had not done in the past that we are aware of and were never invited). Another example, our grandfather (the only one we are close to on Dad\u2019s side) suffered a frightening medical emergency that was life threatening and was in the hospital for weeks. We found out from Facebook 2 weeks after the medical emergency, even though our family knows how close we are with him. There are countless of times, but these are all just the ones that have happened in the last 6 months.\n\nWe are never treated like family from Nicole\u2019s side, but we have been okay with that. We\u2019ve told them after they\u2019ve made some rude comments, that we respect their decision to not view us as family members as it wasn\u2019t their decision and not fair to demand that of them, but we ask that they respect the fact that we are Eric\u2019s children just as our step siblings are his as well. They\u2019ve all seemed to ignore our request and have continued to be disrespectful no matter how kind we are to them.\nNow, my father &amp; Nicole are not oblivious to this treatment nor are they unaware of their own actions, but they gaslight and try to manipulate us to feel bad for them instead of acknowledging how we are feeling. We\u2019ve had conversations about our feelings that just end up being a conversation on how my father is \u201cdistraught\u201d that we think of him like this\u2026 \n\nAnother thing that has frustrated me, is that during university, I had to work at minimum 63 hours a week while being a full time student to afford basic necessities. Because my father paid for my step siblings education (same cost) he told everyone he paid for mine. First of all, this was extremely harmful for me to see- him happily paying for an education of a step sibling (before she even went to uni) of mine but seeing me struggle and not offering help once. My father has been very financially successful since i started highschool, and could\u2019ve paid for all of his children\u2019s educations without a dent in his financials. But I never expected him to do so, and honestly being financially supported by him would be the last thing id ask of him. I was frustrated as he took my victory to celebrate as his own by diminishing all of my effort and hard work.\n\nThat being said, although our step siblings had all of their bills(phone/insurance), clothing, cars, braces, and such paid for.. we never asked for anything except for once. Morgan asked for $20 to grab a bra at the store when she was in highschool staying with him for a few months as she was being bullied. He gave her one of Nicole\u2019s old bras that apparently looked disgusting and sweat filled and told her that this was all he could offer.. like I said, my dad was / is very financially successful.. $20 is \u201cnothing\u201d to him\u2026 that was the first &amp; last time me and my siblings asked for anything and my sister moved home where my mom took care of it.\n\nAnyhow, we have suffered a lot emotionally and always felt unwanted... constantly wondering why our step siblings have the dad we\u2019ve desperately needed. We are constantly feeling exhausted and emotionally low after spending time with him and that side of the family but we don\u2019t want to cut them off.\n\nIn some weird effed up way, we still love him and don\u2019t want to lose him\u2026 but also, is it fair to continue to put ourselves through these extreme negative emotions? I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not great on our mental well-being, but I fear cutting contact may feel worse as it was ultimately my decision.. what do you guys think? Do you think there\u2019s a way we won\u2019t feel this way while maintaining contact?\n\nSorry it\u2019s so long, if any of you would like more info I will provide by response. As per knowing my father\u2019s financial status, I\u2019ve done his taxes for him since highschool\u2026\n\n Also thank God for our mom &amp; her family... Everything we are is because of them",

            "comment": "Putting aside the abuse part of it, I think it's not that surprising that your father pays attention, even more attention, to his step-children.  Reason being is that he has a new wife, and the old wife kind of loses the support of a husband when they are no longer married.  Yes, maybe he should care more about his own kids, but likely his new wife and what she wants has a lot to do with that.\n\nI mean think about it from your own perspective.  You fall in love with a guy, he leaves his wife, you marry him, ... how do you feel about your husband devoting time and resources to his ex-wife and his children from that marriage ?  It's easy to say you'd prefer that he take care of his kids, and I think that too, but she may not feel like that, and in a lot of ways family is the family you are with, not who you have some kind of theoretical responsibility for.\n\nYour biological mother lost her husband.  Your father is no longer her husband.  His new wife is his wife.  That's just part of what it means to divorce.  She lost his support from that point on, he essentially owes her nothing after that.  He does owe you something, probably legally as well as morally, but in a lot of countries that basically just means he can't stand by and let you starve to death.  Even in the United States it starts and ends with child support, and if the ex-wife has custody he's not liable for anything more than child support.\n\nI don't blame you for wanting to have a closer relationship with your father and wanting to have equal treatment to his step-kids, .. but people want lots of things that they don't get in this world.",

                    "comment": "First of all, thank you for taking your time to read this lengthy post.\n\nTo be honest, maybe because I\u2019m not a parent or divorced but I couldn\u2019t imagine ever treating my own children this way regardless of my feelings towards their mother.\n\nMy parents have spoken a total of one sentence to each other since I was 3. That sentence was about the abuse and neglect, even though my mom doesn\u2019t know majority of all that happened, she spoke on what she knew and he responded with an apology and that he shouldn\u2019t have done what he did and was going to get better to continue visits.. Since then, there\u2019s been no communication between them. And step mother is aware of this.\n\nIt\u2019s not necessarily about attention, but more so about a meaningful relationship that all of us could rely on emotionally. He will constantly tell us you are my blood, my family and I will do anything for you guys, then don\u2019t make us feel like outsiders\u2026 my dad will hold our accomplishments as if they\u2019re his own \u201cthis is my kid, i raised him to do this\u201d when in reality, he never raised us and still doesn\u2019t treat us like family outside of his own public praises\u2026 or say he love us so much in front of his family and to us but then does the complete opposite of what a loving father would do. \n\nMy father\u2019s responsibility to his children isn\u2019t based off of a failed marriage. He wanted dual custody so then act like a parent. If you cannot act like one then don\u2019t request to have shared custody. It\u2019s that simple.\n\nIf his new wife doesn\u2019t want us in his life and he wants to do right by her, then be a man about it instead of treating your children like shit. But I genuinely don\u2019t believe this is the case.. as much as our step mother has been neglectful and rude in the past, she has also been a lot better towards us than our father. She has also acknowledged undeserved treatment towards us unlike our father.\n\nYes many people have wants in this world and don\u2019t get them. And if a meaningful relationship is not attainable for my father and I, then so be it. I\u2019ll be upset but I\u2019m sure in the long run less than how we\u2019ve felt since toddlers.",

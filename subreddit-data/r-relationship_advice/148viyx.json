    "postText": "I (21 F) just want some input / opinions on this, since I'm not shure if my point of view is unreasonable.\n\nTLDR: \nWe are (best) friends since elementary school.\nShe wants me to unfollow 2 of her Exgirlfriends on Insta, bc it makes her uncomfortable, knowing that I still follow them. I don't want to unfollow them though.\nOne breakup is ~ 4 years ago, the other one ~ 1,5 years. \nShe now is in a new happy relationship for ~4 months.\n\nShe already brought this up some months ago and said it was bc they kept coming up in the reccomended section. I then stated, that I am uncomfortable unfollowing people (idk it's just sth I never do with people I know in person) - especially if there is no bad blood between me and them.\n\nShe then somewhat accepted that and blocked one of them, bc Ex 1 tried following her twice. \n\nI saw, that those 2 exes had contact via their Stories (they don't have shared social circles, so they probably bonded over my friend). I purposefully didn't tell my friend about that bc I knew the would be upset.\n\nA friend (F 22) of mine, that knows my friend and ex 2 briefly (and also follows ex 2 on insta) randomly met ex 1 at a uni course (same degree) and talked about me and my friend (just smalltalk). She (F 22) told my friend about that encounter as they met bc she didn't think anything of it.\n\nMy friend didn't take the news very well and had a small mental breakdown. She now requested me to unfollow the exes again, which I personally don't think is sth I have to do bc it doesn't affect her, she just doesn't like knowing it. The problem with insta recommendations was fixed by blocking them.\n\nI don't want to unfollow them, what are your thoughts on that action?\n\nShe already wanted me to cut ties with her first boyfriend ~6 years ago, who I met even before they dated and also was good friends with. She later admitted, that it was unreasonable. Maybe that's also why her request bothers me.\n\nSorry for the long text, and any mistakes (not a native speaker) but I am very unsure how to handle the situation and I would appreciate some Input on that. ://",

Her asking you to block your long term friend is unreasonable unless he did something harmful to her other than just breaking up. You can obviously follow whoever you want but it\u2019s kinda weird to get so hung up on this if you aren\u2019t friends with these two exes",

You can't solve this problem because it's unrelated to anything you've done. \n\nMy opinion might be different if this is something worse than relationships that happened to not work, but as it is, I'd say something like \"We already went through this with your ex boyfriend. I'm not going to cut people off every time you have a breakup.\"",

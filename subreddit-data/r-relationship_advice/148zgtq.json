    "postText": "my best friend recently got out of a relationship and expressed to me she wanted to keep things casual in her dating life. i supported this because she was in a long term relationship that wasn\u2019t a great fit for her, and it seemed like a good idea to go on dates to get to know what her type is. well, recently she has been talking to me quite a bit about all of her hookups she\u2019s been having. i\u2019m starting to get concerned because she\u2019s meeting people on dating apps, and within the day of speaking to them, is inviting them to her house so that they can hook up. her safety with these completely random guys is concerning to me. additionally, with the amount of people she has been hooking up with, i worry that about STD\u2019s. \n\nthe other part to this is that she has expressed that she wants to keep things casual with the guys she\u2019s seeing. there\u2019s a few guys that she\u2019s been hooking up with multiple times recently, and she has become completely obsessive over them. she won\u2019t stop talking about them, and becomes angry if they don\u2019t respond to her texts. these guys seem to only want to hook up, which is what she\u2019s repeatedly stated she wants, but as her best friend, the only thing i\u2019ve been hearing about is how pissed off she is that they won\u2019t respond to her. i explained that if she\u2019s just looking to hook up with people, then she should move on from the guys she feels aren\u2019t treating her right. she\u2019s persists and continues to invite them over and then rant about them. \n\ni suppose my point to this is that i\u2019m starting to wear thin from hearing about all of these different hookups. i also worry a lot about her being kind of reckless. we hung out recently and the only thing she talked about were these different guys. i was unable to get a word in in about 45 minutes. i\u2019ve just never met someone who has talked so much about hooking up with others. \n\nhas anyone else had a friend like this? how do you even handle it? she asks for advice but rarely follows it and then finds herself deeper in the situation. \n\ntldr; my (24f) best friend (24f) has been hooking up with a lot of men and then becoming obsessive over them after stating she wants to keep it casual.",

In terms of worrying about her hookup safety, really all you can do is communicate to her that you hope she\u2019s safe, her STD status isn\u2019t really your business. And in terms of her monopolizing conversation, I\u2019d assume it\u2019ll wear off and pass after a while. If not, your options are only to communicate with her about the issue or reduce your time spent together.",

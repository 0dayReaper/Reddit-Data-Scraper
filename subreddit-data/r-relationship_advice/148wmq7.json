    "postText": "How would you have avoided this?\n\nHello everyone,\n\nLong story short someone that works at my job started being very interested in me. \nI am 25 M and she is 25F so same age but I am way up the ladder as a director.\n\nShe started being flirty and really interested in hanging out so we went to dinner and it was awesome! I didn\u2019t try anything with her because I knew she would make me work for it.\n\nWe planned a motorcycle ride for tomorrow but last night she came over to smoke and have some wine. I got a bit too high and talked a bit too much about the fact that I liked her but I honestly don\u2019t think I was too much.\n\nI did kiss her but when after 20 minutes I tried again she was like \u201cthis is not the moment\u201d.\nI did have a feeling that the night was not right because I was asking all the questions to make her talk but she wouldn\u2019t reciprocate.\n\nToday she texted me she wants to stay friends. I plan on not answering her as I won\u2019t see her for a bit and then just say \u201cokay\u201d.\n\nAny suggestions on how to handle this better next time and if I can do anything at this point?",

Taken the time to get to know her and how I feel with her. She backed off because she thought you were trying to have sex with her or you told her after only one date how much you like her already so there\u2019s no build up, excitement or challenge for her. It seems like she chased you and once it seemed like she had you with little effort she lost interest. Honestly it\u2019s probably a good thing because if you guys ended bad it would make work very difficult for you.",

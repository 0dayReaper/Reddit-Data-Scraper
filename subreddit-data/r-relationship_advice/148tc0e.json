    "postText": "Hey guys i\u2019ll make this short and sweet. My little brothers gf had one of her friends over. I got back from the gym and she was in the kitchen looking for water and i helped her out. We ended up chatting and she left later but was cool to talk too, i didn\u2019t think anything of it. Next week my little brothers gf tells me that her friend thought i was hot and she thought we had a \u201cconnection\u201d. A week later (today) I just followed her on instagram and she followed me back 5 minuets later. Should i slide in her dms or hold off to when i maybe see her again in person?",

So you have the thing in mind first and you literally say when you next see her \u201cHey, (her name goes here), I was planning on going to the (thing) (when) and wanted to see if you\u2019d like to join me?\u201d\nFormal dates suck, best to get to know each other in lower stress fun situations where you can see how she relates to you around others, and them around you.",

    "postText": "My fiancee (24F) has had a short temper for many years and depression problems since 2020. I (25M) have been with her since 2019 and have seen her depression/anger slowly getting worse over the years. She has gotten to the point of basic day to day tasks like driving on the highway, going to the grocery store, etc are things she will get unnecessarily angry and ruin her whole day. We used to go do more activities together (hiking, concerts, seasonal events) but now we will either go and leave early, cancel last minute, or just not do it because she can't deal with people then gets depressed because we didn't spend \"fun\" time together. I still love her and care about her overall well being but I'm just tired of trying to help her with no signs of her wanting to help herself.\n\nTLDR: I'm trying to help my fiancee with her anger and depression but she won't help herself and I don't know what more to do to help?",

At the very least, push out the wedding date (like a year) and tell her that she needs to see a psychiatrist and/or psychologist to work on her depression and anger issues. I think if she refuses to do this you should end the relationship or call off the wedding. If she agrees, wait until she shows some real progress. Support her and be there for her. Then re-evaluate whether marriage is the right next step or whether you don\u2019t believe staying together is the best choice.",

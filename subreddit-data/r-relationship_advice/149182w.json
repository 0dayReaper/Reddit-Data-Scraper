    "postText": "My gf hates when I\u2019m busy doing maintenance in house. Because my attention isn\u2019t focused on her.\n\nEverytime I spend a few hours doing yard work or maintenance inside house. My gf gives me a cold shoulder because I\u2019m not paying attention to her\u2026 it\u2019s getting out of hand. I started redoing the bathroom and it\u2019s like I have to sneak to get anything done. Is this normal? I feel like a bad person because I\u2019m just trying to make house look nicer. She wants me to just lay in bed all day with her and that\u2019s just not something I want to do right now. Any advice?",

Tell her what you told us here: that you obviously love spending time with her, but you can't let the house deteriorate, nor spend every living breath by her side. Getting berated every time you try to keep your home nice and, well, just functional really, makes you feel like a bad person. You know you aren't, and you're sure it's not her intention, but it still hurts to de treated like that. So you would like to be shown support for the mental load you're taking on your shoulders instead of scorn.\n\nGive her the benefit of the doubt at first it might be a banter that went too far, if she flips out on you or dismiss your feelings, you know she isn't really interested in your feelings.",

Give her a heads up that you need to chat about something so she isn't caught of guard and goes into defense. \n\nSuggest an evening to chat. Tell her you will get some food in or cook. Get her her favorite dessert or wine (one glass to relax no more, you both need to be sober) and approach conversation as \"I feel like I am letting you down, I am want to fix our home but I don't know, I feel like something I am doing is upsetting you and I hate the feeling you are upset\". Throw in a few \"I love yous, you are important to me, I want you to be happy, help me be better\" etc etc.... So she doesn't feel attacked and she should open up to you.",

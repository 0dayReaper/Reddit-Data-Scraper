    "postText": "For context, I work retail for a local small business, and my bosses are a married couple. I've been there about two and a half years, make $12/hr, and about a year ago I dropped out of college and they moved me up to a full time manager position.\n\nI literally do not know how to describe my situation except that it seems like one week my bosses love me, and the next they hate me. It all started when they decided to make me a manager. I never had any issues before that. The best example I can give is that two weeks ago, they were talking about how proud they were of me for running the store by myself while they've been away for the past month, and they gave me a raise. Then, last weekend, one of them checked the security cameras while was there, saw me on my phone, immediately called me and started yelling at me, and they've both been hostile towards me ever since. I didn't even get the chance to tell him that I was only using my phone to text him the sales total for the day like I always do.\n\nToday, I found a list that one of them wrote of things they need to talk to me about. I don't think I was meant to see it. On that list it said that they want me to start turning my phone off and keeping it in my purse for the entire work day, and that I wasn't allowed to eat at work anymore (I don't get a lunch break so l occasionally bring something to snack on while I'm doing computer work). Am I wrong for thinking that these requests are unreasonable? What do I do in this situation? What do I say when they talk to me about these things?\n\nTLDR: My bosses can\u2019t seem to decide if they like me or not, and now they\u2019re making some request that I think might be unreasonable. I don\u2019t know what to say to them.",

Once you get out there in the world you will understand that you have marketable skills and your confidence will grow accordingly. In general, people have the most success when they switch companies every few years.  You seem like a responsible person who takes work seriously, that alone will make you a dream employee in many places.",

Two years plus the title of manager is a lot more than your average retail worker starts with.  Start looking around for jobs in your area.  I think Target starts at $15 an hour which is already more than you're making, plus, you'd get to actually eat lunch.  And with your management experience, you could probably get even more.",

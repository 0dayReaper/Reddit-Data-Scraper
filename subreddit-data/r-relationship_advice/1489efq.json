    "postText": "Hi everyone. My bf 27(m) and I 27(f) have been on and off since we were 20. It has been a rollercoaster of a relationship unfortunately. We decided to try to work it out but I went on a long vacation with my family back to my hometown. About 1 week in, his texts were short and eventually he stopped texting me back.. I didn't bother him too much because I am fed up with always being the one to chase the relationship and I didn't think too much of it I guess. I was having a fun time with my extended family since I haven't seen them in years and there is a big time difference. \nLast Saturday, I checked his location randomly and saw that he is in a college town at a nightclub and his location quickly changed to some flats near that nightclub not too long after. \nI became really frustrated and texted him that I can't do it anymore and told him to leave me alone and proceeded to block him on social media and via phone. \nThere is a lot of past of him being shady, lying and cheating so I guess everything caught up to me. \nHe hasn't tried to reach out obviously but I am not sure if I should feel regret or relief. \nI just don't understand why he would go to a night club at a college town and not let me know... especially since we made the boundary that we would let each other know of these things in order to repair the relationship. \nI'm obviously very sad now and do not know what to do. I regret being that quick to end things but I felt so disrespected and angry.\nShould I apologize to him or let the situation go?",

But since you guys have been on and off for so long you might enter a phase where you could be...vulnerable to try again. Your life of course, but with what I have read here I would suggest standing your ground and look for someone else. Not right away to be honest. You could certainly do with a bit of time to heal and be comfortable with and by yourself. \n\nSurround yourself with friends, family. Do sports or hobbies, do everything you want to do that makes you happy if you can. Try new things that you always wanted to do. And from that happy place (which is easier said than done, I know) I am relatively sure you will be able to find someone better suited to you. \n\nTake care and all the best to you.",

    "postText": "Well let me give some background information as the situation will be hard to understand without it.\n\n7 years ago I got married to the girl of my dreams Denise(Fake name), we had been dating for 2 years before that and it was like a dream come true, that changed after our marriage. After our marriage she constantly started feeling down and out of it and eventually I got her to go to a doctor who sent her to a therapist and from there we found out she had depression to do with things from her past that she was trying to forget. I decided to be as supportive as I could be, I took care of most of the house work, despite working 40 hours a week and told her to just get herself in order and if she needed to talk to me I would be there for her.\n\nThat was 6 and a half years ago, before she left she was still depressed, she basically only lays in bed and complains, she does nothing, we had no intimacy, no sex, no cuddles, no going out, my entire day was filled with work and house work. Day in and day out I worked my ass off, came home to a mess of a house and started cleaning up, starting dinner and so forth at the end of the day I was exhausted and all I could expect was for Denise to unload more of her trouble on me and complain about herself, me and everything around her. I could not even hang out with my buddies to get away from it all as she would relentlessly call me saying she was scared and everything so I also had no social life, not that I had time for it anyway...But despite it all I pushed through hoping that sooner or later she would break out of it and we could have a proper life together as I loved her and as they say for better and worse and this was quite clearly worse, possibly the worst it would ever be.\n\n4 months ago she got a new therapist and 3 months ago that therapist suggested she needed time away from me as her depression started when we married so I may be the cause of it, the moment she told me I was crushed, I started doubting myself, blaming myself, worrying, but beneath it all this creeping sense of having done everything for her, having sacrificed years of my life as a cashcow and a servant for her to lay in bed and this is my thanks? It is my fault now? But I rejected that feeling, trying to talk through it, but she decided to leave and stay with her mother, saying she needed time away from me and that I may be the cause of her depression and so forth, honestly the entire argument is a blur in my head.\n\nI spend the next month when she moved out calling her, her family, begging and humiliating myself just to get her back, apologizing for everything I may have done wrong, honestly I was close to ending it all as I was so hopeless at that point. But that month passed and as it passed I couldn't help but feel relieved, I came home and it was quiet, I could indulge in my hobbies which I had not done in years, the place was not a mess every time I came home, I could relax and two months in I even realized I could hang out with my buddies again, grabbing a beer, enjoying life and slowly I started to realize that I had been miserable this entire time. Slowly that turned in to more and more realizations before I realized I honestly did not love her anymore, I felt like my youth was wasting away, I could do much, much better than this, I felt like I was a caretaker of a handicapped old lady, hell I still looked good and as I went out I started once again gaining back my self confidence, women would flirt with me, I felt wanted even though I never did flirt back.\n\nAfter all these realizations I suddenly got a call from my wife, saying she made a huge mistake, she was sobbing her eyes out and how she was an idiot taking the therapists words as fact and how much she loved me. For a moment I wanted to say yes, yes please come back...But I couldn't, I just blurted it out and said to her she had left me and I was done with this relationship, I told her I would get divorce papers and I told her I had wasted enough time as it was and this final action of hers was the nail in the coffin, after that I just dropped the phone, started crying for a bit before turning in and feeling liberated.\n\nThe issue now is, is that everyone in my family is telling me I am making a mistake, I should take her back, I owe it to her to try and make it work, marriage is not always fun etc. The thing is, I never had fun in this marriage, I can't remember the last time I had fun and wasn't miserable, we are both young and fit and we never even go out, hell the last time we had sex is over a year ago, all I am to her is a fucking servant as it seems and I rather live along then spend one more hour taking care of her. But on the other end, I doubt myself, am I really dumping someone that is depressed? I feel horrible about it, I feel like a failure...I just need advice.\n\nEDIT: Wow, I stepped away from my phone for a while and return to a ton of comments, thank you all so much, I will try to read them all.\n\nEDIT 2: While I have a hard time defending my wife right now, let me clarify something that is popping up in some comments. I know for a fact that she did not sleep around with anyone while we were separated.\n\nUpdate: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\\_advice/comments/e33cna/update\\_my28m\\_wife27f\\_left\\_me\\_for\\_3\\_months\\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e33cna/update_my28m_wife27f_left_me_for_3_months_and/)",

That they shouldn't risk their happiness or own mental health for the sake of a toxic man who is in a healing process or whatever. Well, same goes the other way around. Your wife is clearly toxic for you. She is an adult and her mental health is her responsibility. You shouldn't feel bad to put yourself first. I bet she wants you back because she has seen that none is willing to take care of her (or be her personal servant) the same way as you\n\nGood luck with your life and be grateful for your friends who are still there for you after all this years.",

While its true it wasn't long enough and she needs to be more proactive in helping herself to get better (which is actually necessary with mental illness), I don't understand everyone getting mad because she left. She didn't leave because she didn 't love him (as far as we know) and she probably doesn't want him back just to \"use\" him. \n\nI assume (yes, I'm assuming because we don't know her side) that she has realized that he is not causing it, and it is possibly worsening without his support (emotionally I mean). I don't get why everyone thinks depression is taking advantage of someone and that she had malicious intentions. How he described her sounds like Chronic Depression. While yes, she should have been doing much more, she probably wasn't using him (especially since she is actually diagnosed). I'm not saying OP is wrong to leave her, but she is not some evil villain. Mental illness can be even worse than physical, because it comes with mental, emotional, AND physical pain/issues/aspects. \n\nAlso, her following advice from her therapist is what you are supposed to do to get better. Her therapist recommended she leave to see if it gets better. Seeing as she did it, I'm guessing she does want to get better. With depression this bad, desperation for any happiness or even less pain is intense. She wasn't in the wrong for leaving. She was in the wrong for not being more proactive in getting better. \n\nBut again, OP is not in the wrong to leave or even take a break until she gets better (if he still wants to try for the relationship at all).",

All of the people telling you to take her back didn't have an additional full time job on their hands taking care of her.  She spent time with her mother, who probably didn't cook, clean and care for her nearly as much as you did, so now she wants her servant back.  Run for the hills my man, be happy, choose things in life that make you happy.  \n\nOur culture needs to get away from the \"grind it out, things will get better\" mentality.  Dramatic, sometimes painful changes are often the only way to get relief from troublesome times, and your soon to be ex wife will probably learn that in the process as well.\n\nEdit for everyone concerned with the \"grind it out\" part of my post...I'm saying it as a generalization.  I know Marriages are marathons, but they are marathons of give and take, not marathons of how long you can be someone's servant.  If this guy doing EVERYTHING for his wife for 6 years didn't help her get out of the slump, she's not getting out of the slump based on his actions, and he can't help her.  Grinding it out won't help either of them, best he can do is help himself at this point.",

Someone else's marriage not working can scare family members because it makes them anxious about their marriage. \"Things seemed ok but... Things seem ok in mine. Could I have a problem? Nah, he just needs to try harder.\"\n\nI agree with telling those who you are closest to how bad it has gotten, then ask them to support you regardless of their thoughts, and to talk to others about supporting you. Seek out support. You have been starving yourself of emotional support for a very long time and living with a \"normal\" that you are just now recognizing is not healthy.",

I had no obligations that I didn't set for myself, and for various reasons I was deliberately in a holding pattern at work, so my stress levels there were low. I got in better shape, started dating and going out with my friends again, and at the end of the day/evening I got to go home to an apartment that was *exactly* as I had left it. My God it was glorious.",

Stay strong and don't be afraid to be bold with all the people telling you you're wrong.\n\nWhat I would suggest is the following.  If someone close you you has an opinion you should give them the respect of hearing them out.  When they're done let them know what you decided and that it was the last time you will discuss it with them.  You respect their opinion, you listened to them now they need to listen to you.

I have mental health problems, but in my relationship I have been continuously working to get better and be better--in general as a person--because I feel an obligation to **be someone who is healthy for my partner**. I would feel obligated to end things if I honestly felt that I was a negative contribution to their life. The other side of that is that I work to be a *positive* addition. He's told me I inspired him to want to be better too, I got him to reach out to his friends more, there's a lot that we prompt in each other that has made both of our lives better, and feeling such a strong desire to want to be good for him is one of the top reasons I know that I love him so fucking much.\n\nSo no. You don't have an obligation to stay with her. And to be completely honest with you, at any point in your marriage she should have maybe checked in with herself to see that she was being a detriment to you, your health, and your happiness. She didn't even have to consider how her behaviors and lack of initiative with her health was affecting *her*\\--I'm talking about her duties within a relationship, just the baseline, bare minimum, of checking in on the man whom she married.\n\nI wish you the best of luck my dude.",

The depression is already killing their desire to do anything so the free time all they will do is something menial and be stuck in their own head with the depressive thoughts\n\nSeeing a therapist will help. Some things you can do on your own though would be to try and help him find a couple things he can do each day that gets him back on the path he needs/wants to be on. Make a plan and stick to it. Something that helps him feel accomplished and like he's moving in the right direction. It doesn't even have to start out huge. Unemployed? Just work on your resume for at least 30 min a day as an example. Specific actionable items help a lot.\n\nIf they stumble on their items, encourage them to try again. You just have to be a little careful and not enable them. The best thing you can do is help them help themselves.",

I made lists for him to do (at his request), tried calendars with reminders, tried a white board, tried a schedule.  He's been in therapy for a year now, as well as on medication, but I haven't seen any change.  He's waiting for the therapy and the medication to 'start working', I guess?  I asked him to start making a to do list each day that has 3 things on it.  If the first item on the list is \"make coffee\" and he makes the coffee, he gets to cross something off his list.  Nothing worked. He'd agree to do things and just not follow through and tell me he's sorry that he's broken.\n\nI've gotten done with the idea that I can no longer trust that he'll do anything he says he's going to do.  Him insisting that he'll get something done is more like a promise it won't get done. I can't make him want to get better.\n\nI appreciate the advice though. You never know how far down a path someone has gone, and for someone in a different stage of this issue it might be really helpful.",

But I did not include even close to all of it in this post, see it is not like I did not try to get her more active, try to get her to keep to what the therapists said she had to do, start small, start big, radical changes, small changes, the reality was...She never did really want to do it I think? At the end of the day the only thing that could have helped her the most was herself, is herself and if she won't help herself other people can't randomly fix her, it took me being removed from the situation to realize that and to realize I was destroying myself for someone who did not want to fix herself, I was not happy, I was on automatic pilot, I was exhausted but there was no \"Me\" in this relationship there was not even a \"We\" there was just a \"Her\" everything revolved around her.\n\nWhat I am saying might sound harsh and insensitive but don't do what I did, in the end you get no where, her leaving may have ripped me apart the first month but now, 3 months later it is honestly the only good thing she did for me these past several years and it was not even intended to be good for me.\n\nLeave, start anew, it's not worth it, you might feel horrible about it, you might feel like you failed, I know I did and still do but the reality is beneath all the sadness and hurt I am happy for the first time in a long time.",

Talking with a therapist is talking with an impartial third party who can help you to work on improving *anything.*  They can help you work through things without any agenda.  I think the stigma of therapy being somehow bad or a sign of weakness has mostly gone away because there's no weakness in it.  It takes strength to realize you could use some help and to go out and get it.",

It's more often about just equipping yourself with the mental tools that you need to tackle challenges that life throws at you.  Think of a therapist more like a flight or a diving instructor.  They show you the equipment you need, how and when to use it, and the source of potential dangers that come with the environment.  It's really not any more complicated than that.  And, as you go through your sessions with them only to find that you *do* have an illness?  That's okay!  They're there to help you through that as well.\n\nGood luck, bud.  Cheers.",

Her lawyer is going to expect you, the only breadwinner in the family, to pay enough alimony to keep up her lifestyle. This means probably at least enough to get her rent and maybe even a housekeeper, depending on how that entire narrative goes.\n\nBut - you can't put a price on happiness, comfort, and being able to have the autonomy you learned you need.

You bent over backwards to accommodate her for seven years.  You gave up your friends, you gave up your hobbies, you gave up your own enjoyment.  What more could you possibly have done?  And all your wife did was complain and, despite her depression, it sounds like **she** was the one who refused to try to make it work.\n\nYou can explain it that way to your family and if they still give you shit for it then you tune them out until they stop.  You held up your end of the commitment; your wife didn't.  Live your life for you, dude, not for your family's approval.  If at the end of the day you can look yourself in the mirror and know you did everything to make your marriage work (and it really sounds like you did) then that's all the approval you need.",

Because I'm not married to her. And I don't want to deal with her intense and constant negativity.  \n\n**I would rather YOU deal with it.**   \n\nSo understand that all these people telling you to swallow your pride and take your wayward wife back aren't looking out for your best interest. They just want peace and quiet. They want you to take one for the team, sacrifice more of your time, burn away more of your happiness, so that their lives can go back to normal.   \n\n**That's why you need to stay strong.**    \n\nYou have your friends. Tell them about the situation. Ask them for support. Hang out with them more often and lean into this new and awesome life you've found. Go out on dates, fuck beautiful women, and live the life you were destined to live.   \n\nDude, you're 28 years old. You are entering the prime of your life.

The proof is in the pudding, and they will see soon enough that you are happier and more fulfilled now. This will take time, you've got to remember that you've had *years* of direct experience, whereas for them this is probably much more jarring. Your experience has been a slow, torturous grind: they likely believe that things were working as they did not directly experience the fact that this only worked because of how much you sacrificed during the relationship.",

It was basically as if I was the one saving her life and she couldn't do it on her own, I couldn't trust her to take care of herself and therefore I couldn't trust the relationship to be emotionally fulfilling for me. She would require me to be there for her constantly because she was scared and if I wasn't there it was as if I was being awful to her. There was no middle ground that you would get from a relationship where both parties are equally as self caring and responsible for themselves as the other. There was no emotional space to just exist without someone needing me to do something for them. \n\nI seriously doubt you are the cause of her depression, it is likely that maybe the relationship was safe enough that her depression felt like it could come out and be dealt with.\n\nYour family don't know how you feel. It's as simple as that. 'better or worse', 'sickness and health' are other people's words and thoughts, not yours. Trust yourself and your feelings because they are the only experience you're going to get in this life. Only she can save herself, you seem to have proved that with your years of toiling.

You deserve happiness OP and I wish you a little bit of my happiness because it's great.",

            "comment": "My first advice: take everyone's advice lightly, as they are not you, and do not own the full experience and feelings that accompany this situation. \n\nSix years is a very long time to be in a valley with no peaks. With three months passing by, it seems like you should have had plenty of time to consider your true feelings.. ultimately it is up to you, if you value commitment to marriage and growth with one person, or your own self growth and freedom. \n\nI think you made the mistake of enabling her depression, like enabling a drug addict, by over supporting her and making her life too easy. It enabled her to depend too much on you, to be allowed to only complain, and to not seek ways to make things better herself. Coming from my own experience, depression basically demands that a person takes the easiest route, does as little work as possible, and continues to suffer. It takes difficult situations that don't allow this to bounce out of it. \n\nHowever, I do NOT think you are at fault. This is a common mistake people who love someone make. She should have sought for help a long time ago. \n\nSpending that much time with seemingly no happiness, to me, would mean that the relationship is conclusively damaged. \n\nSo, if you do take her back, support her when she is low, let her know that she is capable, but do not DO things for her. \n\nIf you don't take her back, keep this concept in mind for other women, and keep in mind that others' opinions will soon be less forced on you and unimportant. \n\nTLDR: The relationship seems conclusively damaged imo. You may have enabled her to continue to be depressed, but she should have sought help herself. In future relationships, be supportive, but not a servant.",

And I always tried to imagine that path which is why I put up with it all for years, I always hoped to get back what we had, to get the person I loved back but at the end of the day, imagine is the key word here, it only seems to exist in my imagination.\n\nThe only way there is any possibility of me not pushing through the divorce or at the very least allow her a chance after the divorce is if she shows me she is finally, finally going to work on it, get on the path to where she at least manages her depression instead of letting it manage her, I said for better or for worse once and you know what, I can take a bad few weeks and a good few weeks, but I am only getting the bad, I rarely get the good.",

I think a lot of the times people think a person with mental illness has to be handled with kid gloves but I think that just gives the afflicted too much room to continue their behavior. Tough love has to be a part of getting better. I have depression and anxiety too but I realized I was never gonna get better if I just continued doing the things I already was doing, thank God my mom (who was a nurse in a mental health facility for most of her career) had the guts to tell me that. Therapy isn't magic, you have to apply what you learn there to real life. Go on and live your live to the fullest now!",

I'm unwilling to make the same sacrifices I made before, and that's it.\n\nTake a break from anyone who can't support your need to be happy.

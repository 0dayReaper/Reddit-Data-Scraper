    "postText": "My bf and I have been seeing each other for almost a year now but I have yet to meet his girl best friend who is arguably his closest friend, we'll call Sam. He confides in her with everything and they text almost daily. Thing is she lives across the country but they met in high school which is why they mainly communicate over text. Is it a red flag that I haven't met her? I don't know if I'm just jealous and I don't want to seem crazy for bringing it up. For the most part I leave their relationship alone and never really ask about her. \r  \n\r  \nFor some context: A couple months ago, I overheard a conversation with her on the phone where she was saying she doesn't like me and telling him we should break up. He told her \"She had a problem with you too\" and she gasps and goes \"that bitch\" which makes him laugh. Since then I broke up with him for a different reason. He was basically emotionally cheating with another girl. We got back together 2 months ago and he's really been different and super transparent about everything. However, he told me when we got back together he didn't tell Sam about any of it which was kind of weird to me.\r  \n\r  \nHe's never made an effort to have me meet her. I even suggested a trip to the city she's staying at so that I could meet her but he didn't seem like he wanted to. He never calls her when I'm around, but he doesn't have an issue talking on the phone with any of his other friends in my presence. I just think it's weird that she is such an important part of his life, yet I haven't even spoken to her once. I've met all his other friends in college and they all really like me. They always invite me out with them and get excited to see me, so I don't think it's me. When a different high school friend came to visit, he even went out of his way to make sure I met him. \r  \n\r  \nHe has shown me his messages with her once and they seem mostly platonic except I feel like she is the one that tries to make things flirty but he doesn't reciprocate. Like she sent her a bunch of selfies to help him make her dating app and she kept asking him which ones he likes and \"would you swipe right on this one\". He keeps it platonic and says \"it's a good picture\". She'll also send a bunch of pictures whenever she posts on insta and asks him which is his favorite and he'll respond the same. I have never spoken to her and don't even have her on any socials yet 1/3 of his posts has her in it. I'm not sure if this is a red flag or not or if this is even something worth bringing up? \r  \n\r  \nTldr; I've never met or spoken to my bf's girl best friend despite being so close. I've met all his other friends and we all get a long. I feel like she doesn't like me for some reason and he's trying to hide it from me. Is this a red flag or would I just look jealous bringing it up?",

    "postText": "I know based off the title in being judged extra hard. I don't condone hitting a womann and if i could go back I would. What's done is done and now my family is in turmoil.\n\nSo my aunty and uncle came to my house to talk to my parents. I though this was stupid because of Covid but they went ahead and came anyway. They brought my cousin who we will call Carly.\n\nMe and Carly get along fine but yesterday we did not. We started to argue about about a game system. It was a stupid argument of who got the good controller and bad controller. Everything went down hill when I would not give her the good one (It's my system).\n\nShe tried to take the remote from me, but in the process slapped me across the face with her nails. I started bleeding so I got up and walked to the bathroom. I don't know if she had an adrenalin rush, but all I here is \"MY NAILS!\". She grabs me and punched me in the face. In the heat of the moment, I punched her in the stomach and she fell over screaming.\n\nHer dad comes up the stairs and without asking any questions b-lines towards me. He grabs me, then my dad came and grabbed him before he could hit me. Him and my dad were yelling pretty bad. My mom and aunty are talking to my cousin.\n\nMy dad tells them to get out of his house. As of right now I have gotten text messages and phone calls from my family calling me a woman beater. My dad is the only person to believe me. My mom is saying she believes me, but is acting cold.\n\nHow do I fix this and stop my family from braking down even more? I blocked my cousin and her parents, but I don't know what to do know. I also feel like my uncle really wants to fight me.\n\nEdit: I changed female to woman\n\nUpdate:https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i8hrwb/update_i_14m_hit_my_16f_cousin_and_now_my_family/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share",

I have a cousin who's a year older than me, he is male and I am female, and we would play around and stuff (but he was definitely a rough  violent kinda kid. not a bad kid, but just, yanno), sometimes fights would go too far and we would hurt each other and someone would cry and parents would intervene.\n\n But you *don't* punch people in the face. You might shove each other, have a slapfight, throw each other into stuff etc. but a *face punch* is pretty serious and not a normal kid-spat kind of thing, IMO. I would be pissed about the uncle's escalation, too, if I were OP's parents.",

Punch to the face is learned. \n\nTwo, the fact that her dad was willing to come punch you is also telling of their own weird family dynamic. Your a kid, and she is a bit older and almost an adult, but at the end of the day it\u2019s a kids fight (still very not cool the punch to the face).\n\nI just want to say the world is very big and you can leave and explore when your old enough. Your immediate social circle and surroundings might be your everyday life for now but if you can hold on and be a decent person you can make your own life and leave these crapy pseudo events perpetrated by losers behind.",

I am one year older and can honestly say I did not begin any of our physical altercations when we were younger.  He  had a horrid temper back then.  I defended myself many of times but none of our family ever really got involved except to tell him he shouldn\u2019t hit, especially a girl.  He would reply I wasn\u2019t \u2018really\u2019 a girl (tomboy) just to get under my skin a bit more.  If I had thrown the first punch they would have said the same thing to me.  \nWe became super close in our late teens and remain that way even today.  We grew up.  \nThe whole family has no \u2018dog in this fight\u2019 just the immediate family members.  Cousins fighting is similar to siblings fighting.  It took her two/three hits before you responded, that\u2019s fairly decent self control for this age.  \nSo glad your father believes you and hopefully he can handle the rest of your family.  Your mom may be in a bit of shock at the entire scenario, I bet she comes around. This is not as common as it was in my younger days but gender honestly shouldn\u2019t be an issue when you are simply defending yourself.   \n\nI hope it all works out and it doesn\u2019t become some huge family stigma you are saddled with.",

Make sure that you have a timestamp on these pics.\n2. Document what happened. Best to write it on a blank piece of paper and take a photograph, again with time stamp. Write it like \"This happened, then this happend.\" Memories fade over time. Written memos remain. You never know when this might be useful. Ask your father to write his version as well.\n3. **Never, ever be with that girl in a room again. If she comes over ... go out of the room. State clearly \"You hit me last time. You are a liar. I don't trust you/Due to legal liability, I prefer to have witnesses present/I want you to leave.\" If her parents say sth, then counter with \"You think I hit your daughter and you still want me to be in the same room as her?\"**  \nIf she reacts in such an aggressive manner and then lies ... just be careful. This behaviour is dangerous and I wouldn't be surprised if there are other 'victims' who would report similar behaviour from her.\n4. Screenshot the text messages of the family member you are getting.\n5. Unfortunately, this is probably a \"he said, she said\" situation. So, other redditors might have better ideas here, in terms of legality, how to react with the relatives.\n6. About your mother - maybe ask her point-blank \"Do you think that I hit her unprovoked? Yes. Or No. Have you ever seen me hit somebody unprovoked? Do you trust her more than your son.\"She should either say \"Yes, I think that you hit her\" and then you can have a discussion, or she should say \"No\" and stop with these passive-aggressive comments.\n7. **If you speak or write to people, be really, really careful how you word things! Not something \"Yes, I hit her.\" ! More like \"She scratched my face and then hit me in the face. I had to defend myself.\"** Words like \"self defence\" and \"was disorientated and shaken due to her punching me in the face.\" are your friends. Be clear and be consistent. Make sure that she is clearly titled as \"the aggressor\"... \"when Carly attacked me, first by clawing my face, then by punching my face, I was afraid. I felt the need to defend myself.\"\n8. Run every communication by your father first.",

Carly could say that he tried to touch her and she scratched his face in self-defence, then OP came at her again, she again hit him in self-defence and that's when OP punched her in the stomach.\n\n**That's why I am telling OP to screenshot the current messages. To take contemporary notes. To be really careful with the current messaging. To make damn sure to be clear on what she is accusing him of.** Currently, it's a \"he is a woman beater\" situation. If Carly alleges that OP tried to touch her, then the situation might escalate.\n\nSorry, OP, as well.\n\n**EDIT:** To be clear here, I am a woman and I don't think that Carly will do this. But all it takes is one question like \"so how did this whole alteration start?\" \"so you tried to take his controller?\" or someone asking questions like \"are you sure that he did not try to touch you? You can tell me\" and this entire situation can take on a very dangerous dynamics - especially with such a volatile father.",

Make it clear each and every time it's brought up that you were scratched in the face and punched first, and you only acted in self defense. And if anyone disagrees with you just leave it be and say something along the lines of \"I know what happened to me, believe what you will but the truth is as I said previously\". Remember, emotional outbursts win battles, controled emotions win wars. And with family it's usually a long drawn out thing.\n\nHell, there might be some other internal issues that your mom is facing (maybe she has some unresolved abuse issues from her past), so don't hold it against her until you have that conversation with her. While she might not be able to give you the benefit of the doubt becaue of something you don't have the knowledge on, be the bigger person and give her that benefit until you know better.",

That part can\u2019t be emphasized enough. \n\nDo that, and I\u2019d make a point to not tell your parents or aunt and uncle ahead of time. I only include your parents, because you don\u2019t want them telling the aunt and uncle ahead of time, because if the cousin finds out, she could spin it. \n\nNext time they are coming over, tell your parents you will not be alone with your cousin, and why. \n\nWhen they arrive, if anyone suggests you two go do something, loudly and clearly tell everyone No, and explain why. If they (the aunt and uncle and cousins) are going to insist on sticking to their version of the story, then you can\u2019t be expected to be alone with her. \n\nWill it make the visit (more) uncomfortable? Technically not. The visit is already uncomfortable , now it\u2019s just uncomfortable for everyone. \n\nAs far as the cousin goes, how things play out depends a lot on what she does. If she steps up and tells her parents that she instigated it, and apologizes for starting the whole situation, especially to the test of the family, that\u2019s one thing, and you can be nice and social with her, but in public, especially if she does this with the extended family. Heck if she steps up with the people there, you two together could tell the extended family it was a non-issue that got blown out of proportion, and stand up for each other. \n\nIf she wants to blame you, and won\u2019t take responsibility for starting the physical altercation, then ghost/shun/whatever her for the whole visit; she can\u2019t be trusted, and nothing positive can come out of the visit, unless you\u2019re a one party consent state and can get an admission out of her.",

You're doing way more than a 14yo could think of to keep the family together. Your cousin is older than you an acted like a baby and scratched and punched you and you acted out of self-defence, you have nothing to feel bad about it. \nSince things are going haywire anyway, I say rip the band-aid right of and confront your mother in a calm way and ask her why she thinks it's justified to take cheap shots at her 14yo son rather than explaining what she thinks he did wrong and if she's disappointed in you then so are you. You're acting more mature than your mother for god sake! Your father is awesome bdw!",

You can\u2019t dispute anything \u201cin writing.\u201d If anyone tries, by deleting their texts, you\u2019ll still have yours and can request that family member\u2019s text records.\n\nI know this is obviously worst case scenario, but 14 y/o boy v.s 16 y/o boy could come out to be disastrous. Especially considering family is already taking her side. Sorry OP. I think you having a penis is what\u2019s hurting you \u201che said she said\u201d\n\nBeing a teenaged female though, she\u2019ll brag to someone.

But I worry sometimes if I said something like, \"If she had been right, she wouldn't have caught a left\", that my tone would encourage people who actually believe that hitting women (or anyone, any kind of domestic issue) is an acceptable thing.\n\nAnd I honestly don't know how I feel about it because nothing kills a joke faster than a \"/s\", but I don't know how else to kind of flag that sort of stuff.",

Sarcasam is literally only defined by the sarcastic inclination in real life.\n\nIn this case, the joke was obvious (Ah yes officer, as you can see he tried catching the bullet with his face!), but some people get upset when they say something incredibly racist and go \"guys? wtf it was just a joke so I have to dumb everything down for you guys now? Fuck that! If you guys can't tell a joke then what I should I care?\"\n\nYou need to make sure it's ACTUALLY absurd, but I've seen so many people butt hurt over statements that are impossible to tell.\n\nJust calm down :/ oh no, you poor thing and your jokes are being ruined by society! This is awful! Fuck all these assholes for not being able to tell if I'm ACTUALLY a flat earther or not! God, we ruined comedy! What next?!

I honestly don't see anything you did wrong. You hit her once to get her off you and then stopped.\n\nThe reason people tell men not to hit women is for one reason only. Men typically have a significant physical advantage against women due to having a higher bone density and more muscle, including much stronger upper bodies than women. Even when the woman is extremely fit it's almost always an unfair fight. It's like a flyweight versus a heavyweight boxer and the man could accidentally do a lot more damage than intended. I am a six foot tall woman and 4 inches taller than my husband, yet he can pin me in an instant and I would be truly helpless against him if he ever decided to take his force out on me.\n\nGiven your age, you are not a fully developed man yet. You have a lot more growing to do physically. Depending on how developed/undeveloped both of you are it could have actually been an equal-ish fight. So to play the \"woman-beater\" card at this point is ridiculous. Also, any woman with half a brain knows that attacking a man is a bad idea because even though he may not hit back right away, he will eventually. Nobody expects strong grown men to not defend themselves whatsoever. Ideally, people hope men try restrain the woman and get away rather than fight her back but that's not always possible nor is it fair to expect a man to always react perfectly under duress.\n\nYour extended family are behaving in quite a sexist manner and hopefully, they will calm down soon enough. Either way, I would stop spending any time alone with that cousin. She clearly is manipulative and has self-control issues. The controller argument should have never gotten physical in the first place and that was 100% on her.\n\nAs for your mom, maybe get your dad to look at this post and you guys can come to your mom together and talk this out. No more cheap shots or passive-aggressive BS. Just real talk, cause right now she's being a real B-word. And I say that as a fellow woman.",

It's unfortunate, but ignoring the truth of it will do you no favors. So stick with your dad, and if they're ever ready to hear your side of things, don't be super-quick to forgive, and make sure that you NEVER forget how they acted.",

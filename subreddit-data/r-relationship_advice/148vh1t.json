    "postText": "Some context:\n We\u2019ve been together for 7 months and he\u2019s the first person I\u2019ve ever been in a relationship with. He\u2019s my best friend and I can\u2019t imagine a world without him. I was completely inexperienced before him. We are also long distance (kinda). He lives 2 hours away and takes the train and a bus to see me. \n\nSo I am a sensitive girl, and he\u2019s an even more sensitive guy. He\u2019s never been afraid to show his emotions or cry, which I think is such a strength of his. \n\nI am EXTREMELY severe anxiety to the point where my head makes me self sabotage with intrusive thoughts and constantly second guessing myself. Since he and I started dating,  things moved really fast. Said \u201ci love you\u201d after less than a month of being official (we had been talking for a long time however). There\u2019s always kind of been talk of us moving in together but now that I am more financially stable than I once was, I am actually looking into apartments and it scares me, thinking about living with someone I just see on the weekends fully living with me. \n\nHe quit his job several months ago and does not seem motivated to find a new one. We\u2019re still splitting dinners, food, etc. down the middle like we always have. He also doesn\u2019t have his license and doesn\u2019t seem motivated to get that either. I know these are superficial things, but he knows that I am getting tired of being the taxi during the weekends. \n\nWhen we first got together, he was very affectionate. Compliments, hugs, kisses all the time. Now, I have to ask for hugs and cuddles. It breaks my heart. When we go to bed at night and he turns over, my heart breaks. And I know that this happens to couples- less of these things over time. But I feel that my affection hasn\u2019t changed. \n\nSometimes I\u2019ll jokes around and talk back to him. He always seems very startled by this. Again, he\u2019s a very sensitive guy. \n\nSo that brings me to my question-\n\nHow can I bring up these topics to him? I don\u2019t want to seem crazy or accusatory of anything. (Not that i think he\u2019s doing anything like cheating/talking to someone else). \n\nI don\u2019t want to hurt him. We have our really nice moments. We\u2019ll teach me some stuff on guitar, he\u2019ll hold my hand in the car and do funny impressions and then listen to me talk his ear off about my job or my day. He held me as I sobbed when I found out my grandmother very suddenly passed. \n\nI just really miss how we used to be and it breaks my heart because he is my best friend and my world. \n\nSo please, if anyone can offer advice on to how to bring this up to him, please comment. I want to fight for him. I always tell him I\u2019d be there for him and he\u2019s there for me too.",

I'm puzzled.\n\nIt doesnt sound like you two are on the same page at all. He turns over at night?  Is there any intimacy?  He might not be a cuddler in bed but surely he demostrates some desire for intimacy?\n\nUntil these problems are resolved you should not move in together.",

I\u2019m looking into low income housing so I feel like it would be smarter to have just my name be on the apartment anyways. \n\nWe are still intimate. Initiating is 50/50 usually. He\u2019ll cuddle me for a little bit and then turn over. I think I was overthinking that part a little. \n\nAs for the joking around, it\u2019s a mix of things. We\u2019re both very sensitive individuals so we\u2019ve been known to both kinds hurt each other\u2019s feelings. The way I deal with it is joking about said things that hurt my feelings another time. I don\u2019t mean to bring it up to start anything, but to purely joke about it. So now, any time he says something that could remotely hurt my feelings, he\u2019ll say something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m gonna hear about this for months now aren\u2019t I?\u201d He just makes me second guess myself. This has been my coping mechanism and humor for YEARS so I don\u2019t plan to just change it. \n\nSorry I\u2019m kinda all over the place \ud83d\ude05",

As the honeymoon period elapses, the intimacy and romance in a relationship can move to a lower more sustainable level. What you are seeing is very likely what long term intimacy looks like to him.  It is possible he demonstrates his affection in other ways or by doing other things like holding your hand or that guitar lesson.  At the end of the day, you might want a partner that is more demonstrative of his affection and maybe this isn't the guy for you?\n\nIs he actually trying to find employment or is he getting too comfortable with you paying for everything?  Are you supporting him or being used by him?  Another possibility, is he depressed and lacking motivation and affection because of that reason?",

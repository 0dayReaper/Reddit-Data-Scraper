    "postText": "Sexless Marriage\n\nHello everyone! I am a female (35) and my husband is (34). We have been together for 10 years and married for 8 and in the last 5 years we have not had sex at all. My husband was a virgin when we started dating (me not so much) and he has always had pretty bad sexual performance anxiety.. even on our wedding night he couldn\u2019t perform.. about 9 years ago he started seeing our church pastor and he was able to perform (for about 2 years) we ended up severing ties with the church (unrelated reasons) and eventually his anxiety came back. We have not had traditional sex since 2017-2018 and it\u2019s driving me crazy. We do have oral but for me it\u2019s not the same. We even tried viagra but I didn\u2019t work. I have begged him to look into more counseling and he always say he will do it but he doesn\u2019t fall through and I think he is fine with the way everything is\u2026. I even asked him if he is ok with an open marriage but he was not fond of it (he is quite jealous) everything else in our marriage is great except this one thing\u2026 he is really my best friend, loving person, and sweet\u2026 but I get so frustrated and it makes me feel undesired in that way\u2026.he is always hard whenever we are around each other or I am naked BUT as soon as he thinks he has to stick it in his penis goes limp\u2026 it makes me feel like shit and less of a woman to be honest. Part of me wants to cheat since the only thing I am missing is sex. And advice? Part of me feel like I should just live with being practically celibate for the rest of my life",

Which is actually kind of worse.  if it was only a physical thing, he could simply take some blue chew and be good to go.  But since it's psychological, it's gonna take more work.   He needs to talk to a therapist.  He's obviously got some kind of hang up in his head and he needs to work that out.  \n\nHave a serious talk with him.  Sex is a big part of a relationship, and you never signed up for a celibate marriage.  Let him know he has to at least try, speak to a therapist or something.  And if he's not willing to even try, you're going to have to seriously consider getting a divorce.",

Is there any way to maybe contact the pastor separate from the church?

Maybe that could also help alleviate some of your sexual stress when he can\u2019t perform. Definitely try the therapy route though so that you guys can find a more permanent solution",

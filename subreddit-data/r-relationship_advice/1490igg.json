    "postText": "we continued dating after high school and it had its ups and downs throughout long-distance but i had always respected him greatly and trusted him a lot. we had many private and intimate conversations and he was a loving and caring partner. \n\na couple months ago a lot of factors coalesced that led to us breaking up and i went fully no-contact after he started being very rude and disrespectful to me while wanting to maintain a casual/fwb status (???). i later found out that he had been saying very awful things about me to a group of his female friends that were still in high school while we were in college and things about me and our relationship spread like wildfire. \n\nfrom casual and intimate conversations we had that he actually thought were weird, to things like him thinking he was a lot better than me and deserved better and that he was out of my league, to him apparently wanting to breakup with me this whole time but thinking it was just too inconvenient??? it\u2019s funny because on the other side he would constantly ask me to reassure him that he was attractive to me etcetc. basically he was feeding this toxic friend group details and also hanging out with them all the time behind my back to gain clout or something. \n\nthere\u2019s more that he did that people who know about this don\u2019t remember, and i\u2019ve gotten over this breakup but have gained a distrust of long distance or quite frankly, relationships in general. not sure how i can grapple with my constant feelings of disgust and betrayal. i had a good reputation at my high school (good student, got into a good college etc) so rumors about me continue to spread very easily.\n\nany interpretations of why he would act like this and how i should pursue future relationships would be appreciated.",

            "comment": "Some people are assholes. It makes no sense to spend hours and hours trying to figure him out because he\u2019s not thinking about you in the way that you\u2019re thinking about him, if he\u2019s thinking about you at all. You\u2019re allowing him to live rent free in your mind while he\u2019s out here living LaVida Loca. You have to start doing things with your time so you don\u2019t have so much free time to think about him. Go volunteer, start working out more, get a hobby. Start writing in your journal, get some counseling. Start getting more involved in yourself so that you can work through that. Life is about ups and downs and sometimes relationships don\u2019t work. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a horrible person, and it doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s necessarily evil, an asshole, but maybe not evil. Give yourself some grace and keep working on becoming the woman that you\u2019re supposed to be.",

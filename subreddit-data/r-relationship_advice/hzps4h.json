    "postText": "First of all I want to thank every single one of you who commented on my last post. The love and support I received was immense and it actually made me feel a little better in the mess of it all. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. All of the following happened yesterday so excuse me if I ramble a bit , it's all fresh in\n my mind. \n\nORIGINAL POST\n--------------------------\nMandatory:  I have been with my gf Sarah for 3 years and been living together for 1.5. She is honestly everything I have ever wanted and I planning on proposing somewhere next year.\n\nSo 3 weeks ago I was out with Sarah at a local bar drinking and having a great time with her as it was just after quarantine had ended where I live. At around 3 am we decided to head home. As we headed to the parking lot where we had parked we noticed a group of 2 girls and a guy who was clearly drunk trying to hit on them and get them to go to his house. The girls were clearly very uncomfortable and trying to find a way out. Sarah told me that we had to do something and I told her go call the cops and get someone as well because the very leat I wanted was her to get hurt during this.\n\nSo I approached the group and try to pretend I was the boyfriend of the one of the two girls and long story short I got my ass kicked. The guy was at least 6ft4 and 220 lbs where as I'm 5ft11 167lbs . I'm fairly mascular myself but there was no way I could have taken someone that big, I knew it from the start. At least from all the noise we had made a lot of people rushed the scene and the girls got away safe. I was rushed to the ER because the motherfucker had broken my ribs which had punctured my right lung. Yay.\n\nAfter that incident Sarah has grown a distant from me. Even though she visited and stayed with me at the hospital she hasn't been the same since. And I thought she just needed time to move past this. However 5 days ago she told me that she is not the same person after what happened and she doesn't know if she feels safe with me after I got beat up like that. Honestly hearing that hurt me more than when I got my ribs broke. She has  moved to her parents for the time being and she told me she needs time. Meanwhile I had no one here to help me so my brother left his 2 boys and wife to move in with me. I know I'm just venting at this point but I don't want this to be over like that. Reddit is there anything I can do to salvage the situation?\n\nUPDATE:\n_______________\n\nUntil yesterday it had been 14 days since my last contact with Sarah. My brother had left 4 days prior because I felt bad keeping him away from his family for so long, plus I could take care of myself to some extent. So around 2 pm while I was making lunch I hear the doorbell ring. I go to open the door and there she is. Sarah. With tears in her eyes, eye bags, frizzy hair,looking like a total mess. During the time we've been together I've seen her in her ups downs but I'd never seen her in such horrible  state before. So I let her in she sits on the couch , we haven't still said a word as we were both dumbfounded. I was so overwhelmed by emotions, I wanted to hug her, I wanted to full on blast on her, I didn't even know what I wanted to do. So I did nothing and waited for her to talk.\n\n After 5 or 10 minutes of silence she starts sobbing and saying she's sorry and, then full on crying. At this point I can barely hold myself together. So I hold her hand and  try to calm her down so I can figure out what is going on. After a while she finally somewhat calms down and starts talking. And that's where it got bad. \n\nSomething that I didn't include in the original post, because it wouldn't make sense to anyway is that Sarah's mother has been divorced and remarried once. From what Sarah has told me, her biological father cheated on her mother while she was still a kid and that's why they broke up. And that's also why she doesn't have any kind of relationship with her father. It seemed odd when I first learned about it, but I didn't question it. That is not the whole story though. \n\nSarah's biological father didn't only cheat on her mother. He was a drug addict pos, that also used to beat her up frequently. Without getting into a lot of graphic detail  in one instance when Sarah's brother tried to intervene and protect her mother he ended up getting beat up too. So when she saw me intervening and getting my ass kicked in the bar incident it triggered some kind of PTSD in her head that she could not control . That's why she had grown distant and eventually left. It all spiraled out of control and she could not handle it.\n\nIn those two weeks we'd been apart she'd barely eaten or slept and even made some really dark thoughts which I'd rather not go into. She told me is a horrible girlfriend for  leaving me alone in my condition and that she doesn't  expect us to be together again after that,which I told her  isn't the case.\n\nSo we have a very long road ahead of us. My number one  priority right is getting her to see a therapist, which I suggested we can do together if she's scared to do alone.\n\n\nSo yeah that's where we are at. Some of you were right, that there was some deeper issue behind what happened but I could not have possibly known.\n\nI also wanted to take this opportunity to say something that I got messaged about a lot. I got a lot of comments and messages saying that I was a moron for what I did at that parking lot and that I should mind my own buisness next time and not play the hero, etc . First of all I did not initiate the fight with the dude. As I said when I got there  I tried to pretend I was the boyfriend of the one of the girls in case. When that didn't work I got between the girls and the dude trying to create some space between them and that's when he started to push me and eventually  started throwing punches.\n\nSecondly no matter how hard I hit the gym I would never be able to take that guy one on one. As I said I'm pretty fit, and  I've been working out for several years but the fella was a lot bigger than me. Unless I had a gun or something, which isn't legal in my country I was doomed.\n\nFinally  for the people telling me to mind my own business, well let me you that what exactly what I was doing. It is mine and everyone else's responsibility to look after the ones who can't protect themselves is this shitty world. No, I do not consider myself a hero, nor did I do it for the show. I did it because in some other instance one of those girls could have been my girlfriend, sister, mother needing help. And these girls  were somebody else's girlfriend, sister or mother .  If I was put in that situation a hundred more times I would  act the same.\n\nEdit:I also talked to her about the proposal I wanted to make this year. I was planning on doing it as a surprise but in the way the things have turned out I figured it would be better if she knows it first. We both agreed it should be delayed for now.",

I hate that we have to consider some guy's feelings when we're being harassed just in case he decides ignoring him is some affront to his fragile ego and decides to prove his masculinity by hurting someone.\n\nI'm so sorry that happened to you, and thank God for those guys who didn't \"mind their own business\" and got involved!",

I've met lots of creepy men, they wanna see me smile, if I'm working all alone, how long I'm alone for, am I scared by myself? Just having 1 or 2 men like OP come in the store who ask if I'm okay, wait around if someone seems sketchy, tell me if something suspicious is happening outside, one man even gave me a pocket knife of his for saftey. While it might seem like small gestures to them or just what they were raised to be like it huge for me and is why I'm able to work overnights in less fear.",

If you expect another civilian to get involved in a hostile conflict where they are likely to get seriously harmed then you are probably going to get dissapointed.\n\nThe reality is that the state has monopoly for violence (police and military) so it's the states responsibility to protect its citizen. Every sexual assault, rape or regular assault is a failure of the state to do its job, not of regular civilians who are more often than not told to intervene in situations where risk of serious harm is possible.",

I don't mean that you would have done anything, but some other guys might. They might feel like she owes them now.

When in a group of girls once we actually invented a game of how many times have you gotten groped, since it made it a bit easier to deal with if you turned it into a game with a point system. When I went out with guys in my group I was never bothered I assume because they didn't want to target me because what if I was taken already by one of those guys. Its horrible but these people seem to think single=free game (and some don't even care if you're in a relationship, had a creepy guy saying he'd be much better than my bf when I said that's my bf at the bar getting a drink)",

At the least, shout at him from afar and let him know the police are on their way and make a big scene. DO NOT INTERVENE ALONE BECAUSE YOU WILL POTENTIALLY die.\n\nIgnore the toxic masculinity and terrible gender roles being propped up in this thread. Do the right thing but do the smart thing. No one is gonna be there to call you a real man for sticking up for a damsel in distress when you\u2019re stabbed and bleeding to death on a sidewalk.\n\nI\u2019m genuinely disappointed at the women in this thread saying \u201cyou did the right thing\u201d. Would you say the same if your boyfriend or partner was lying on street stabbed and bleeding?  Because I can say from experience (and from situations where I was in a similar spot as OP) that this is the most common occurrence. Again, if you\u2019re a man with buddies, you must say something and do something but don\u2019t get killed. I\u2019ve noticed a lot of the younger kids and are much more likely to speak out as a group, but maybe this is just an urban Canadian thing.",

I hate to be cynical but it\u2019s also realistic to know that on the internet people will make stuff up for likes/upvotes whether it be videos for their social media or posts for reddit. \n\nLike I say I don\u2019t frequent this sub so I don\u2019t know how often posts like this come around but I\u2019d say, the genuine people who do the right thing for the right reasons don\u2019t plaster their business over the internet to get a pat on the back. \nOn that note I really wish people would stop doing stuff to \u201craise awareness\u201d on Facebook, if you really give a shit about something then just allocate a monthly payment from your wages to a charity in that field and you don\u2019t have to tell everyone about it.",

She got distant and weird, stopped talking to me, so I asked for space. She immediately went and slept with him. We split up and I left. Point being, it's a surprisingly common occurrence. Regardless of how \"woke\", or outside of the gender roles and norms, a lot of women perceive an aversion to fighting, or a loss in a fight as a lack of strength, and it seems can't help but be turned off and/or weirded out by it.

The fact that YOU took a shit kicking trying to do the right thing and SHE makes it about herself is beyond alarming. You can bet your ass she's just going to do the same thing any time in the future you run into problems, be them physical or otherwise.\n\nYou may think you're being a nice guy staying with someone with \"issues\" but in reality all she's going to do is whittle you down until you either hate the relationship and/or completely resent her. Other peoples emotional baggage isn't yours to bear.\n\nLastly, I actually think you did a noble thing trying to help those girls but I will say this: If you're gonna pick a fight with a dude substantially bigger than you, unless your a trained fighter, you better learn to start fighting dirty.",

It's so stupid when men feel like they need to play batman to save any women they remotely PERCEIVE to be feeling uncomfortable. If you feel like it has a chance to escalate to an assault (which you can say about literally any encounter), call the police and give them descriptions.\n\nWho's to say those girls weren't capable of defending themselves? most girls I'm cool w/ carry around pepper spray and certain defense kits whenever they go out. It's also in public w/ a bunch of people in the area, very few dudes are gonna do anything in that situation. \n\nThis white knight thought he could be batman and paid the price for it. No sympathy here, and it's sad to see all the people on this post encouraging this behavior and calling him a hero. \n\nAnd yes your gf is gonna probably lose some respect for you after seeing you get your shit pushed in for playing batman for 5 seconds \n\nlesson here is to pick your fights wisely. Stop thinking you can be a superhero to every single girl you see on the street",

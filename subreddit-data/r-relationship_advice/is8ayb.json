    "postText": "Warning: long update ahead. Here's the link to the previous post- https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/iq1ebc/my_25m_girlfriends_25f_sex_drive_has_completely/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb\n\nThanks to everyone who replied to my previous post. There were some mixed responses, with some people suggesting I insist on addressing it with her because she's hiding something, with others recommending I give her time to open up on her own.\n\nUltimately I decided to sort of go for a combo of the two. Friday, when we were both done with work, we sat down and had a discussion.\n\nI told her that I could give her the space and time she needed till she was ready to talk to me about it, but I couldn't leave it unaddressed. She needed to acknowledge that there atleast WAS something that she didn't feel ready to tell me, and that was fine, but she atleast needed to acknowledge its existence, if only so I stopped feeling like I was going crazy.\n\nShe started sobbing when I was done and then she started explaining everything.\n\nSome background that I didn't mention in my previous post because it didn't really seem relevant is that my girlfriend has PCOD. One of the consequences of this is that she finds it very difficult to lose weight and has been insecure about her body for most of her life. About a year ago (completely of her own choice, I have always told her that she's beautiful to me no matter what her weight), she resolved to start losing weight, both for her health and to feel better about her body. She started going to the gym a couple times a week, and I was supportive and also cut out all my own junk food consumption in solidarity.\n\nSince the lockdown started and gyms shut, apparently she started slowly gaining some weight back due to stress eating and lack of exercise. I am ashamed to say I did not even notice that she was torturing herself over her weight all this while. She admitted that she stopped having sex because she was terrified I would stop finding her attractive after seeing her naked. I reassured her that I think she's gorgeous and attractive no matter what and I tell her this everyday, but she was afraid that would have changed once I saw the weight she had put on.\n\nThe rest of the conversation consisted of me reassuring her that she's beautiful and her appreciating but not really believing me. After a bit, she asked me to change the topic, and I reluctantly agreed. We had a fairly quiet dinner, she was a little sad and relieved at the same time at having told me, I think. And I was busy scheming.\n\nThe next morning before work I told her she looked lovely again and she gave me a wan smile, like she appreciated it but didn't really believe me. But that was okay. I was gonna convince her. I asked her to pick up the groceries that evening because I was gonna have a meeting run late.\n\nThe moment she left home, I got to work. I dug out some fairy lights and a bunch of candles from storage and started setting them up in the living room. Made a couple of playlists and charged the speaker. Snuck down to the florist and bought a giant bouquet.\n\nSome more background, I hate dancing because I suck massively at it, while my girlfriend loves it. She used to go dancing every month or two with her girlfriends before lockdown. I'd join in sometimes because it was worth how happy it made her, but she definitely missed it way more than me.\n\nSo when she got back, naturally I greeted her with what were probably the most ridiculous dance moves in the history of mankind.\n\nI'm not gonna lie, folks. She laughed. She laughed a lot. She took a short video, and we both laughed while watching it later. My movement resembled a five year old practicing kung fu more than it resembled dancing, and I had stuck a rose in my ear for maximum ridiculousness. Totally worth it, though. I have no idea how she ever thought she's ugly, her smile is just so fucking radiant.\n\nWe danced like idiots for a while before I switched to the slow dance playlist. It was definitely the happiest I'd seen her in a long time. I'd been a bad boyfriend and somehow missed how much she missed everything else. I should have done it months ago.\n\nI told her all this. Told her she's the most beautiful woman in my eyes and always will be. And yeah, we had sex. Last night was all about her. She needed to feel special and I had been missing that for too long.\n\nI offered to make dance nights a weekly thing afterwards. Kind of as a substitute for the workouts she's been missing, if she wants. She tore up a little, she knows how much I hate dancing. She told me that wasn't necessary.\n\nApparently sex is just as much of a workout as dancing. And we have a lot of missed workouts to catch up on. I'm certainly not complaining.\n\nIn all seriousness though, I'm gonna dip into my savings a little and order a home treadmill. She can't afford one right now because of college bills, so I'll surprise her with it :)\n\nThank you to everyone who helped me out with their advice!\n\nEdit: Oh wow, I am completely overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support here. Thanks for all the awards! I just logged back into this account but I promise I'm going to read each of the replies. One thing I saw pop up a couple of times that I just wanna reassure you guys about is that she's mentioned wanting a treadmill but not being able to afford one several times in the past, so I know she wants one.\n\nHowever, I figured that it's dumb to take the chance, and one surprise was good enough, and if there's anything this whole experience has taught me, it's the importance of communication. So I'm going to bring it up at dinner tonight that I comfortably have enough saved up to purchase a home workout machine (since I saw cycles/ellipticals being mentioned, we'll figure out which one we want!), and that I'd love to buy one for our home for both of us to use. Thank you all so much once again for your advice!\n\nEdit 2: RIP me, lol, the comments are coming faster than I can read them now. There's no way for me to reply to every one of them, unfortunately. There are a lot of fantastic suggestions for diets, exercise machines, dance classes and everything in between, so thank you so much for all of them! She has a great endocrinologist, who's advice she will ultimately be following, but there are some great points to bring up with him. It is really touching and overwhelming to see all this support. Thank you all so much!\n\nFinal Edit: She loved the idea of getting some equipment to do our workouts at home together, so we're going to sit down and do our research tonight before picking the one we like most. We've gotten some fantastic advice here and we'll be looking at ellipticals, bikes, rowing machines, Just Dance on the Switch and a bunch of other stuff that you guys suggested.\n\nTo all the people who commented to insist she's cheating on me because I'm a simp (lmao), thank you for setting the exemplary standard for being macho. Insulting strangers online is so delightfully masculine. The lovely folks who told me to dump her \"because she's fat\" get the \"disappointing but not unexpected shitheads\" shout-out as well.\n\nFor the overwhelming majority of people, though, I am just breathtaken by the kind and supportive comments we've gotten. Thank you for the treasure trove of advice and LPTs, and all the love! You folks are amazing!",

As much as I\u2019d like to think she would be over the moon with it, there\u2019s is always the small chance she could see it as you saying she does need to lose weight.

However, she may be even happier with a good dance floor (they have some built-in springiness) some floor to ceiling mirrors and some kick ass sound system or Bluetooth headphones.  She may even be into something like pole dancing (it\u2019s an unbelievable full body workout, and super confidence building).  Installing a proper pole is actually a very challenging structural engineering project, so it can get pricey.\n\nShe may also prefer an exercise cycle or an elliptical.  Both are very good machines, and a cycle has the extra benefit of possibly turning into a tv or gaming seat.  I can\u2019t count the number of hours I\u2019ve spent burning calories on a bike while playing a game or watching a YouTube clip.",

Because she may want to have some say in the type or version of treadmill, elliptical, row machine, etc... Whatever you decide.\n\n2. If she is in a bad mental space the day you surprise her, there is a chance she might take you buying it as confirmation that you think she is out of shape or unattractive (I just know that I'm terrible at presenting things the right way sometimes and would word it the wrong way and we don't want that to happen to you!)\n\n3. She might feel guilty if you make such a major purchase for her, my wife can be picky about large gifts because she gets self conscious when i spend money on her. If that's the case, she may want to pitch in on the price and get a nicer one overall. \n\nI'd surprise her with the idea of a home gym, not the stuff itself. \n\n\"I was thinking about getting us some exercise equipment, what do you think?\" Then take the conversation to what you want to get and that you are happy to spend X amount of money and go from there",

There's a possibility she'd see it as pressure to use it/lose weight, so I'd say start smaller. You don't necessarily have to buy her equipment, being creative with couples workouts can be just as good. I would say perhaps buy you each a yoga mat and some dumbbells relative to your strength and try some exercise videos on YouTube. Or even better, you can get dance exercise videos where the moves are relatively easy but still super fun and you just follow along with the instructor. It doesn't matter how accurate you are as long as you keep your heart rate up.",

I would do the bubble bath, dinner and massage thing (and many variants) so that it would lead so sex.\n\nShe caught on and it became a negative. She began to feel manipulated and obligated and I was back to square one.\nIn fact I was further back than that because no matter what I did for her she was looking for the obligation in it.\nThose where rocky times and it almost spelt the end of our marriage. \n\nMy takeaways from my situation that may help you avoid those pitfall are.  \n\nSex should never ever be a reward. It's a mutual activity you both gain pleasure out of. \n\nThe underlying issue of her self esteem manifested in her zero sex drive, but the sex drive is not the reason for helping her.

I hope you both live long and healthy life. Not noticing she put on weight means she really is your love and not your object. Good luck!!!",

Especially now, with COVID, it is likely that some gyms closed down and are selling off their machines for a lower price than stores.  Machines are great, but consider that they can limit your workouts and choose equipment that can be used across exercise styles. I\u2019ve found weights and other items at good wills and for cheap at stores like TJ Maxx and Marshall. \n\nWhat kind of workouts does she typically like to do? For example: for my yoga/pilates workouts, the most important things are my iPad, headphones, and a comfortable mat for floor work.  Or if she weight lifts, investing in a set would be most important to start out with.\n\nAnother idea could be signing up for an exercise app, like the Peloton app which has a bunch of different classes, styles of exercise, and a variety of trainers. She can figure out what she likes best, from the comfort of her own home. \n\nFinally, clothes! Take her out and let her pick out a few sets of clothes. They might help her feel motivated to start when she\u2019s feeling herself in the mirror.",

You two deserve each other :) I was going through exactly the same thing in my relationship (I\u2019m the girlfriend who was exactly in her shoes, literally I resonated with every word in these two posts). It takes a whole other level to be able to understand her like that. You handled it beautifully. Just make sure she never loses sight of her worth, even when she does. Sometimes saying it in words may not feel as sincere every now and then just because she may hear it often, as needed as it feels to hear them, but actions can say those words in another tone! Love that for you guys :)",

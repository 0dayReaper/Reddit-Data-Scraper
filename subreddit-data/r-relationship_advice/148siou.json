    "postText": "We've been together 2.5yrs. He (35m) and I (31f) are planning on buying a home and starting a family sometime this year. \n\nI have made it pretty clear I'd like to split finances 50/50 when it comes to home/baby. He brought up an alternative that we pay our combined monthly expenses bases on percentage of salary. Which would work out to about equal at this time. The problem is he is working two jobs, he is planning on cutting down to finish his masters. So this would mean I am paying more monthly to make up for this cut in income I'd we pursued a percentage split. I don't see this as fair due to I just finished my RN, which I paid for and supported myself through the program. He took me on a date maybe once a month during this time. When he'd visit me at my home I'd cook him food I bought. But he keeps saying he \"supported\" me by buying food. I thought he was just dating me as we had started our relationship about the time I started school. So I feel like he is slightly changing the narrative. It also seems unfair as a woman to give up my body and comfort for pregnancy while I'm paying more money. I was an LVN for 9yrs and finally an RN. It is very demanding work physically/emotionally. While he works from home and takes many breaks a day and even gets to nap. I feel like I'd just be giving too much that I wouldn't have anything left for me. Am I being unfair? I feel kinda upset that he even suggested this kind of a split. But again maybe I'm being stingy? Advice welcome",

He still needs to finish school first. His extra time and money will go towards school, rather than kids/home.\n\nOnce he's out of school y'all can reassess what your combined budget looks like, who has time to care for kids, will you need or be able to afford childcare etc \n\nAside from you feeling resentment over supporting yourself, and now being asked to support him as well, I don't think y'all have the time/money to do house and kids while he's doing school. Especially if you're not willing to step up to the plate and help fill in his deficits.\n\nAs far as him saying he supported you, perhaps he's thinking less in terms of money and more in terms of time. He waited to continue his schooling so that he could be a present partner for you and now he feels it's his turn to continue his school and career path. He sees this sacrifice as an investment in your relationship's long term success, and isn't seeing your situation in dollars spent like you are.\n\nIf you want him to support himself financially during school, why do you want to start a family and get a mortgage at the same time? Would you have been able to pay for your nursing studies yourself, while juggling childcare costs/time? I'm not saying you have to foot his school bill if you're not comfortable with that, but it does sound like you're not on the same playing field just yet.\n\nIf you're not ready to work as a team financially, you have to then be able to accept that he won't be able to match your financial contributions and you'll have to put off these other goals until he can.",

We're flint broke though. So I think taking turns with a big time commitment like school isn't inherently bad or controlling. It let's you get more time together as a couple, and helps you focus so you're more likely to succeed in school.\n\nNot everyone can have the trust we share, or feels comfortable handling their finances the same way. To me, these big ticket issues are suddenly bringing to light the big cracks y'all have in your foundation. You are each wanting to approach a future very differently, and it's hard to say if one of you is all right or wrong. But I do think you should take these feelings as an opportunity to have some very clear talks together. If you can't come to understand one another and find a way forward, it may be that this isn't the person for you",

After we got married, I went to graduate school and he did support me while I was in school.  There is no way I could have gone back in time to support him, and since he doesn't want further schooling, there's no way to support him in the future.  In that sense, it will never be 50/50.  But he did this because he loves me and wanted me to have the job that I wanted and would be fulfilled by.  If you insist that everything absolutely has to be split 50/50 in order to be fair, it's simply not going to work when you're talking about a life together.",

Most graduate programs have specific rules about progress towards completion, so taking a gap is usually not great.  I could also see that spreading out the length of time for his education could make it cost significantly more (or be significantly harder to complete if there is too much time between classes).  So it could make more sense for him to finish the degree he is in the middle of before you pick up another degree.   Essentially if you're not willing to discuss both of your life goals and how you will help each other achieve them, you are not ready for any further steps.",

No, you didn't make a contract requiring he earn a degree like you did, but being in a ltr with someone who didn't support you financially in your own independent earning of that degree does pose the question of if the tables were turned (and I agree with you on this). It's not weird of you to expect he would approach an education similarly and independently through loans. He's an adult, and older than you nonetheless.\n\n2. Further, he doesn't have any intention of noticing your hard work, or ever changing. He notices your work when it could pay for his lifestyle, or school. But that's it. He doesn't sound happy for you (at least if he is I missed it here). While you were busy getting your education and all the work it entailed, you may have glossed over the fact that what you saw as him feeding you once a week was what he deemed supporting you. Those obviously are not the same, and maybe his story changed to support his request of your financially assisting him? Might be his character but that's still some manipulative behavior.\n\n3. You know how hard you worked and work, and if you continue down the same path with this person you may have an insurmountable resentment. You're already saying how physically demanding it has been to do so much yourself. Is it really fair to yourself to push beyond the point of physical exhaustion while he just naps? Would a partner who also recognizes and values hard work be so exhausting, physically and mentally for you?\n\nYes, the money stuff is frustrating. But I hope that you can see how him being a different person than he claimed or expecting you to sacrifice further than he would ever dream himself are red flags. \n\nHe's literally telling you exactly who he is, are you sure this is who you see as your true partner?",

What if you find yourself needing to take unpaid time off or cut your hours as you recover from childbirth, will 50/50 feel fair then? Do you feel like him doing this masters\u2019 degree will increase his earning potential and benefit your family in the long run?

You do not want to go through the growing pains stage of first living together with a mortgage and a new baby in the mix.\n\nBut I also think you're being unrealistic about finances, and that doesn't really bode well for first moving in together.\n\nFirst - if he cuts down his hours to finish his degree, do you honestly think it's fair to him that the vast majority of his pay will be going towards bills? You complained that he only took you out on dates once a month, which doesn't seem very relevant to the issue at hand, but since you seem to want more, how is he even going to pay for that? Have your cake and eat it too, I guess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;It also seems unfair as a woman to give up my body and comfort for pregnancy\n\nThat's a choice you're making though. You do not have to have a baby right now - you could hold off until his masters is done. Being pregnant does not give you a break from reality. The fact that you two aren't even operating as a team would make me strongly hesitate on having a child together. It's pretty clear that you view this relationship and how it functions based on what's best for you, which... is alarming to say the least for someone who claims to be ready to start a family.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;It is very demanding work physically/emotionally. While he works from home and takes many breaks a day and even gets to nap.\n\nAgain... you chose nursing which is notoriously demanding. I'm not critiquing your choice, but the fact that he WFH and you feel like his work isn't as demanding has no bearing on the equity of how finances are split. I WFH and get to nap, but that doesn't mean that I am in front of the computer that I'm not using 110% of my brain to do the work.\n\nPut it this way: when you go on mat leave, would *you* be comfortable sharing half the finances? Something about your previous concerns tells me that you wouldn't want to pay half/half.\n\nIn short, yes, you're being stingy, unfair and unrealistic.",

You need to take a long hard look at yourself and assess whether you\u2019re truly prepared for marriage (or, no marriage but all the trappings of one) because right now you are only thinking of yourself and not at the bigger picture. It is not tit for tat like you\u2019re making it out to be and no relationship can be 100% equal. \n\nAlso, great job at skipping my question about whether you\u2019ll feel comfortable paying half the medical bills when you\u2019re on mat leave.

The more comments I read from you I\u2019m gathering some resentment about this being \u201cled\u201d by him but you have to be the one to foot more of the bill and like you mentioned in another comment, it would be your body going through pregnancy. Really I\u2019m hearing you want to see him have to sacrifice as well, but I could be off base. \n\nThe fact is though you don\u2019t have to be passive in this. Just like you are using your voice now regarding finances, you could set boundaries around when you are ready for a child. \n\nI will say though I agree with a majority of the other commenters that you both are not ready to have a child together, or buy a home. Making long term commitments when you can\u2019t agree on something fundamental like finances or a timeline for children is a set up for resentment from one of you, an unhealthy relationship or the end of the relationship. \n\nI also agree I do not understand how people with children split finances. What happens if the child is sick and one has to stay home? Maybe you guys have very good benefits and will still be paid, maybe not? My husband and I know what we make together each month, pay the bills, put some in savings and then split the rest as free spending. I make more by over double but I couldn\u2019t imagine wanting my partner to not have the same benefits I get to enjoy. I want to live this life with him, not just in the same home.

When I signed us up he wouldn't go saying he wanted to go through his insurance and not do telehealth. That was 6mo ago. He has yet to sign us up though I've reminded him a few times and we've had arguments that warrant a mediator. I feel like he doesn't want to hear me.",

You based your potential future on a past conversation and when he brought up an alternative you feel it\u2019s unfair. That tells me that you both need someone more compatible with how you already run your life. Having a house without married is insane (legally speaking) and bringing a kid into a household while still being in school is extra stressful that sounds stupidly irresponsible. You seem to understand that this is all being rushed. I don\u2019t know if your boyfriend is being impatient because he loves you so much and can\u2019t get started on your futures fast enough or because he wants to be in a position to get all of your combined assets because of your shortened life expectancy. He could be wanting to set himself up with a better degree so when you start to succumb to your health issues he can support you 100%. But what if he is just trying to get a free education and wait for you to fade away. I suggest that you 2 live together for a year at 50/50 before ANY decision is made! I feel like you are protective of how hard you worked on your own dime and don\u2019t want to be made out as a fool for paying for someone else\u2019s knowing that you have a serious disease to prep financially for. I think you need to make sure that there is an account or policy in place  have medical services no matter what. If he doesn\u2019t agree to that then you know that he isn\u2019t really understanding what you need to be and feel secure and end it.",

And before I remarried I had my own business so getting sick was never an option. I definitely have security in my relationship but I\u2019m a realist. He could pass tomorrow or I could leaving him with 2 kids that are not his and a business that has animals tied to it, so do I set up homes for them incase to lighten his load or for my kids? He says he\u2019ll take care of everyone but that\u2019s a lot to ask of anyone. I\u2019m also a product of a narcissistic BPD mother and as a result extremely self sufficient so being at the mercy of a autoimmune in the height of covid with zero income was my worst nightmare. My husband took care of me but we had lived together for a couple years and definitely had finances, kids, pets and afterlife care discussed and nailed down before taking steps to meld our lives together completely, so I knew I could rely on him completely. Still made me feel like I was about to lose my whole sense of security and independence when I fell sick. So in some way I get it. Starting over again with less than you have now is not a luxury you get to have, you and I know our general life expectancy and it is far less than the majority. While others get to assume that they get to live out their lives into old age, live, laugh, loving their way into their new chapter of self discovery. Definitely meant that last sentence with deep sarcasm. So if you guys can\u2019t live in the same space for a year having in depth discussions about the exact future you want (and they line up well) then you should both move on. It\u2019s ok to have a hard boundary when it comes to your end of life care and goals. I don\u2019t know if you have really made that plan yet but I suggest you start, so anyone who walks into your life is absolutely supportive and understands what you want. Zero negotiations. If you\u2019re like me; not having a health care financial safety net/plan is scary.",

It\u2019s not worth forcing something you are already uncomfortable with. My husband has already had to take full care of me and as much as I hated the feeling of being in that position he was \ud83d\udcaf solid and nurturing. I never felt like a burden. I felt safe. I didn\u2019t get this kind of love when I was a child. Dude I shit myself in the tub and he took care of me without hesitation. Spoon fed me multiple times. I have not had a moment where I felt disrespected, lied to burdened, taken advantage of. If I asked for therapy right now he\u2019d make the call. This is definitely 100% but sometimes someone only has 10% to give and the other person has to be ok with giving 90 for an unknown amount of time. Anything less is a hard pass!",

We are 2.5yrs in but he hasn't once let me use his phone without supervision and he locks out his computer when he steps away. Granted he hasn't done anything since that I'm aware but when I brought it up the first few times he yelled at me as if I was in the wrong. Hence our issues. Then he's telling me he supported me in school when I was stressed he may be online cheating and I don't know about it. When I would bring up my insecurities he'd get annoyed. And then he evaded therapy with me. Let me be clear ge is also very nice to me, cooks for me if I'm tired and helps me with things. But it's hard for me to trust him completely the way you describe.",

            "comment": "More couples argue and break up over finances more than anything else so you're smart to try to work this out before you're living together.\n\nI was married for 23 years and my ex-husband and I had a joint account for all the finances. This led to so many problems...\n\nI've told anyone who will listen the best, absolute best way to attempt to subvert any finance arguments is this...\n\nEach of you has your own bank account where your paychecks go.\n\nYou have a joint account where you each deposit each payday your share of the household accounts, such as groceries, utilities, rent, etc.\n\nThe breakdown of the bills is thus: say you earn $100,000 a year, he earns $60,000 (with just the one job). Your total is $160,000, with you earning 62.6% of the household income and he's earning 37.5% of the household income.\n\nThe bills are paid based on these percentages, with you paying 62.5% of the bills, he pays 37.5% of the bills.\n\nEach time your incomes change, then the percentages are adjusted, as are the bill percentages.\n\nAnd here's the kicker... Any remaining monies after putting your share into the household account each payday is yours to do with as you wish, no questions asked from the other side. This is predicated on the fact being all household bills are being paid.\n\nAnd before you say this is unfair, if the roles were reversed and he earned significantly more than you and this \"percentage plan\" were in place, would you still feel it was unfair?\n\nLet's say each month you bring home, after taxes, $6000. He brings home $3,000. These numbers take into account taxes and various insurances. Now, based on this model, let's say your monthly bills total $2500. Using your 50/50 split, you each pay $1,250 a month towards the bills. After bills are paid, your BF has $1,750 a month in disposable income while you have disposable income of $4,750 a month.\n\nHowever, using the percentages system, those bills of $3000 are now split 62.5% and 37.5%, which comes to you paying each month $1875 and him paying $1125. He now has disposable income each month of just over $2625 a month and you have $4375 disposable income.\n\nIf the two of you get married and decide to combine health insurances into one of yours, rather than pay two separately, then things will need to be re-evaluated because now one partner is paying for all the insurances while the other isn't, causing the insurance provider to carry more of the financial burden.\n\nA 50/50 split, based on his income being lower than yours, isn't fair to him and it gives you more disposable income than he. He'll grow to resent you and you guys will argue. Also, since you'll be the higher earner, you might find you're paying for more of the extras, such as dining out or movies. You'll grow to reset him for this.\n\nYou guys need to get on the same page on this and decide what's fair for everyone, not just one of you. Until you do that, there's no sense in living together.\n\nETA: I just saw your comment about his telling you to not go for your Bachelor's. That's no bueno. Why does he get to go to school and not you? A good marriage requires compromise, but not sacrifice.",

But then I feel like I can work part time since I have a good career and still pay bills. It's important for me to get my bachelor's soon so as my health declines I can support myself by stepping away from bedside care. I'd prefer to wait for both of us to finish our degree over the next two years before having kids but he's hell bent on having them before he's 40.",

I've also worked with RNs, so I know the struggle. I would double down on doing 50-50. I would also avoid having kids for now if you're the primary source of income.\n\nI have to ask an obvious question - a house and kids are a serious commitment, are you engaged? Are you sure he's the one at this time?",

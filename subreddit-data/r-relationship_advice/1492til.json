    "postText": "TLDR: I (29F) am in a long-term relationship (6 years) with a partner (32M) who avoids any kind of discussions about our relationship and any kind of conflict by refusing to talk. They are a wonderful person, and we do not have issues come up very often, but I am getting to the point of giving up because I do not see any willingness on their part to change anything. I need some advice on whether or not this is something that can change and if I should have more patience.\n\nIn short, any time I express that something they did hurt me or any concerns that I have about our relationship (e.g. them expecting me to handle all the mental load, them refusing conversations about issues), they shut down and say that they will not talk about it now. When asked about when it would be a good time to bring this up, they say they don't know, and maybe in about 5-6 days when they do not have to go anywhere. This would all be perfectly fine with me if there was a good reason for this (e.g. if they really got stressed during the week or had a lot of commitments), but this is not at all the case as they do not work at the moment and our life is very much free of stress or responsibilities (no children, no pets, nothing major). Since we are moving towards starting new jobs soon and potentially having children, this is exactly why I feel scared to continue like this.\n\nThis has been a pattern for years and even though I would say that I have spent a lot of time working on myself to try to be a better partner in those situations (read books, went to a therapist for help), I don't see them putting any effort at all. While I used to start off the conversations a wrong way (e.g. being more direct, sometimes accusatory), I've spent a long time learning how to correctly communicate with a person who tends to stonewall and withdraw. I've learned what to talk about and what to let go of, I do my best to be very respectful in those conversations, to be calm and relaxed, to use non-accusatory statements, and simply explain very calmly and positively how certain things make me worry and how I hope that we could work on this together as a team because it is important to me and it would make both of us feel better. Even then, it's not enough to not get them to not shut down. I immediately retreat and give them space, but I am (hopefully understandably) hurt by this unwillingness to have a productive calm conversation and I tend to withdraw a little as a consequence. They then get upset about me being upset about it, which I again communicate to them clearly that I am not mad at them, just a little sad because this situation makes me feel insecure and I find it hard to ignore it. They don't ever come back to any of the conversations I have started despite being the one to postpone them. It is a lot of effort for me to make sure I am mindful and go through all of those adaptations for them to not even do any basic work in return.\n\nMy therapist at one point gave me advice on how I can discuss topics with them and printed out a sheet that clearly explains the pattern that we are both in, giving advice on what we can do to better understand each other. She told me to ask them to review it in their time. They never looked at that sheet of paper. When I was going through depression, they never tried to learn how to better support me and often ended up worsening my condition because of their tendency to withdraw when anything negative came up.\n\nWriting this out obviously looks like they are not a good partner, but I am of course not mentioning any of the other amazing traits that they have, which is why it feels like such a difficult situation. I do not want to give up on them, but it is starting to feel like something I can't really be okay with anymore - I cannot just keep putting so much effort into trying to meet their needs to maybe have a tiny chance of being heard and understood. It feels like dealing with a super sensitive child and it makes me view them as less attractive. I don't think it is okay for them to keep behaving this way. I obviously don't say any of those things to them, but it is how I feel and the resentment is starting to build up. \n\nI love them, but if life starts to get more stressful and we have kids... I just don't see how it will work. Is this something that can improve and I should have more patience to see it through? Thank you for reading.",

    "postText": "TL;DR: bf went on a college podcast and kept saying he would beat up any guy who hurt his baby sister. The whole thing struck me as very immature and I'm wondering what to do.\n\nBf and I have been dating for 3 months. About a month before we got together, he was invited onto a podcast hosted by his college media unit. The topic for that episode was on siblinghood and a few other students were invited as well.\n\nHe kept telling me to listen to it since we go together but its 3 hours long and I only manages to make time to listen to it in its entirety a few days ago. And ever since, I've been having second thoughts about our relationship.\n\nWhenever the topic of dating or relationships came up, he kept saying things like \"I'll beat up any guy who thinks he can date my baby sister\" or \"if he doesn't treat her right, I'll kill him\" and other stuff that were in a similar vein. He said stuff like this multiple times, like many many times. I know some older brothers are very protective but it was, for a lack of a better term, cringe. It was cringeworthy, embarrassing, and frankly, lame and pathetic. I was almost dying of the second hand embarrassment because of how \"I am very badass\" he sounded. He just threatened violence over his sister's imaginary bf any time he got.\n\nHe has never struck me as violent. He's very sweet, caring and gentle with me and the people around him but I just can't stomach the stuff he said on that podcast. I'm not necessarily worried he's violent, I'm frankly worried he's immature because who says stuff like that on a public platform? Especially when the conversation and all the other people invited were so chill, laidback and civil.\n\nI just need advice on what to do.\n\nEdit: to the people insinuating he wants to \"bang his sis\" please don't be gross. You guys watch too much porn. I think he just wanted to come off as tough and appear like an \"alpha male\", which I personally find very cringeworthy. Please don't start psychoanalyzing someone you don't even know and bring something as serious as incest into it.",

By your description it\u2019s apparent that his dimeanor in person is of a much more gentle and passive persona which is quite opposite of this radio personality he created. \nMost likely he is harboring some real personal issues in regards to his understanding of what manhood is (tough, badass type) in comparison to how he identifies with himself (weak, cowardly) and having been given a safe platform to present himself as what he ifentifies with as being more manly took that bull by the horns and ran with it. I think you hit the nail on the head because he has some major immaturity and self esteem issues.",

I would personally as a woman prefer if a friend or family member let me know they will be there to support me emotionally and through stuff like shelter, instead of violence too. At the same time it\u2019s weird to treat women like they cannot be responsible for themselves. I know a guy who is having issues with a woman at his workplace slacking off work onto him and he kept saying how if she doesn\u2019t stop he *has* to fight her boyfriend. I find these kind of things so odd. Women aren\u2019t property of the men they date or the male family members or even friends. Showing aggressiveness and possession like this is personally concerning, it just makes it seem like they view women as immature children who cannot look after themselves, so I understand why you are uncomfortable with what he said.",

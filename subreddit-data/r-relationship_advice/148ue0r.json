    "postText": "TLDR: My long-distance best friend and I fell out of touch 9 months ago after hurtful things were said and the friendship became one sided. He reached out recently and asked me to be his MOH in his wedding, but has no idea of financial or time obligations, and only seems to want to talk about the wedding. I\u2019m not sure I still want this role \n\nMy(21f) best friend(19m) and I met online three years ago. We\u2019ve seen each other in person once for a week, and had a very strong and supportive friendship. About 18 months ago he entered into a relationship with his now fianc\u00e9. I think they are both great people, but perhaps not compatible (differ on things like wanting monogamy vs polyamory). It hasn\u2019t always seemed the healthiest to me for various reasons. \n\nLast fall my friend and I fell out of touch. I would be left on delivered for weeks at a time, told after my break ups \u201cI told you so this wouldn\u2019t have happened if you listened to me\u201d and kept out of major life updates until months later. The last straw for me was when I recalled a previously repressed traumatic memory from childhood and was told I may have just been imagining it and maybe I was asexual or just hadn\u2019t had good sex before and that\u2019s why I thought this must have happened. I reached out to try to save the friendship twice and was either ignored or told to wait until his mental health was better. \n\nThe current issue is that he reached back out two months ago and asked me to be his MOH at their wedding next spring. The flight alone would cost ~$400. He can\u2019t tell me what the financial or time obligation would be. I\u2019m already in a tight spot and am a full time student so I don\u2019t have much time to work. He also only seems to message me to talk about the wedding or ask me to plan his bachelor party. \n\nI don\u2019t want to lose him again because we were so close but this feels more like an obligation than celebrating my friend and enjoying the process. I feel like he only sees me as MOH and not as best friend anymore. \n\nIs it worth the time money and effort to uphold this role when asking to be just a guest may jeopardize the friendship altogether?",

            "comment": "To be fair, being in anyone's wedding is a thankless, expensive \"obligation\". But there's also this thing people used to do which is to try to talk their friends out of making stupid matrimonial mistakes. These guys are incompatible just based on one wanting monogamy and the other not. Don't know how old the other groom is but your friend is a literal teenager. So unless this is something you want to do just to go to a fun party you might take your friend aside, point out that this marriage won't last a year and let the chips fall where they may. Good luck",

I\u2019ve attempted to point out the incompatibility before and have voiced my concerns at their level of dependence on one another but have been shot down. It seems like a \u201ceither get on board or gtfo\u201d situation. I love them both, and am happy to contribute time/money/effort, it\u2019s just difficult when they can\u2019t give me even ballpark numbers and only seem to have interest in interacting with me when it\u2019s about the wedding and my \u201cmaid of honor responsibilities\u201d as he puts it",

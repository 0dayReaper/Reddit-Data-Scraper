    "postText": "My boyfriend and I were together for over two years. He is still the most perfect person I have ever met although we are no longer together. We were very close up until his work caused us to spend nine months basically apart. We were unable to see each other or talk during weekdays and could only see   each other on Saturdays, if that. It was clear that we were drifting apart and that his training for his job had changed him as a person. However, neither of us wanted to break up and wanted it to work.\n\nAs a bit of background, I struggle greatly with clinical depression, and especially struggle when I have to spend extended periods of time on my own. After his training was over and he started working, things didn't really change and we found that there was hardly any time to see each other. This was due in part to his work schedule and my own work/school schedules. I found myself getting extremely depressed and he couldn't help but notice, although I tried my best to keep it to myself. After a few months of us continuing to feel disconnected and struggling with communication, I broke down one night and told him I wasn't sure how much longer I could handle spending so much time on my own. In addition to just generally spending a lot of time on my own, I felt that he wasn't really making an effort to see me, which also hurt, as I would dedicate every free minute I had to him. \n\nI ultimately turned this statement around and told him I didn't want to break up and wanted to keep trying, but he said he wasn't sure. I told him I would just be respectful of whatever he chose to do and gave him time to think. During this time, I thought of every way possible I could readjust my schedule to better fit with his and I wanted to remind him that we also had plans of moving in together, which would also result in us seeing each other more often. \n\nHe chose to break up with me the next day, and I understand why. His job was already demanding so much from him, and rather than being understanding, I was only telling him that the time he was giving me wasn't quite enough. Also, I am sure the fact that I was expressing to him that I was unhappy with the current situation was exhausting as well. I tried to tell him that if he shared his work schedule with me, I was more than happy to try and select classes in time slots that made me more accessible. But I think this was too little, too late. For more background, we had previously almost broken up over a misunderstanding where he thought I was cheating. I almost left but changed my mind.\n\nIt has been about two months since then and I have had SO much time to reflect. In the moment, I felt like nothing was enough, but now I realize that I was mistaken. I have tried to reach out to him, but he generally doesn't want to talk to me. He has told me that he has no interest in discussing our relationship or getting back together. He has, however, told me that he is also struggling to move on just as I am. I have considered writing him a letter and mailing it, since he is now difficult to reach via text (I did ask and he said he would be fine with this). \n\nI don't want to waste time saying that I don't want to seem desperate, because honestly, I am desperate. I really love this person and we have meshed perfectly since the day we met. I feel like if I give up on this, I am really giving up someone special and one of a kind. I feel like if I could clearly communicate to him that after thinking, I do recognize the effort he was putting in and apologize for not recognizing it sooner (as well as some not nice things I said after we broke up), he might be interested in trying again. \n\nSo, I need your opinion- do you think this sounds worthwhile? Do you think I should give things more time before attempting to reach out and ask about how he would feel about trying our relationship again? Or does it sound like he will never be interested again?",

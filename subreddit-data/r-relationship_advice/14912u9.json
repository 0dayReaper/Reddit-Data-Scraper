    "postText": "I\u2019ve been dating my boyfriend for about 2 years, and things are mostly going well. He\u2019s helped me through really hard times emotionally, is kind to me, and tries to put my interests into consideration. He is my best friend and has made some sacrifices for me, and I try to keep that in consideration especially with the topic I\u2019m talking about. \n\nSince starting working full time after both of us have graduated college, he has repeatedly made \u201cjokes\u201d related to the idea of him not having to work, and me being a breadwinner. I put jokes in quotation marks because these happen about every 2-3 weeks- they\u2019re played off as just a playful fantasy however the frequency makes me doubt that. He has been miserable since starting full time, but part of me feels like everyone is. My job/field pays decently well, however I\u2019m unsure if it would be enough to support both of us, especially with consideration to working towards retirement and his own interest in possibly owning multiple properties. We aren\u2019t interested in having kids, but the idea of being the sole source of income terrifies me.\n\nI have a hard time asserting or advocating for myself sometimes (not just with him, personal issue) and when I have brought up some of these issues lightly in the past it\u2019s always played off as a joke. Should I be forcing the conversation more? And, does anyone have any advice about how to go about this? I really do care about him and see a future with him, but this potential conversation has been making me very anxious.",

That\u2019s smart, establishing communication about your wants and needs from a relationship is always a good idea.\n\nIt appears from what you are describing is that you have both not as yet found a comfortable way of having these conversations so you both have a tend to play it safe and throw it out there as a \u201cjoke\u201d to test how the other reacts. If that\u2019s the case and you want to move away from that, it\u2019s ok to have a conversation about how you both want to have conversations.  Something like \u201cI can get a bit nervous about communicating about more serious stuff but I think it\u2019s important, how do you prefer to talk about that kind of stuff?\u201d\n\nIn terms of relationship conversations, how to manage finances in a relationship is one of the big ones.  It\u2019s ok to say \u201cI was hoping to have a conversation with you about how you think we would/should manage finances in the future. I have been thinking about it. Can we talk about that?\u201d",

            "comment": "I think for one to be able to go through all these conversations especially personal issues, one needs to be mentally prepared. You mentioned that your boyfriend likes to brush these things off and now he is miserable with his full time job. I don't think he would be ready to talk if u kept pushing. It will be the opposite effect. Thinking about the future can be worrying but yet can be beautiful if one support the other. You said that he helped you go through a lot before. I think the best way to approach this is to see ask him what's causing him being miserable at his job and whether he can see his future doing that job and go from there. If he cannot see no future prospective in his career he is not ready to talk about future finance security with you.",

                    "comment": "I\u2019ve talked about his issues with his job with him pretty often, I just left it out to make it more concise. He has a pretty admittedly terrible commute which contributes to it, but I think he also just hates the fact that it\u2019s not a specific timeline goal to work towards and that it\u2019s supposed to be his status quo from now on. He was super motivated during college and a great student, and I think having the goal to work towards graduation helped motivate him. \n\nI\u2019ve encouraged him to look at other jobs, especially ones with better commutes, but he hasn\u2019t been looking into it until recently. Time off never really satisfies his feelings of being burnt out, but at this point I\u2019m not really sure what would aside from a career change. Most of these conversations based on the future- after homeownership and he always seems excited at the idea of not having to go to a full time job anymore and being able to devote all of his time to his hobbies. \n\nI guess the frustrating part for me is that I feel equally burnt out and have a lot of stress related to my job, but I try to avoid talking about it with him because it can be a bit of a heavy topic (healthcare).",

If your job is not  enough to support a family, you need to do what men though out history have done: get a second job to make ends meet.

Equal rights in exchange for equal responsibilities and whatnot.\n\nThat aside, just tell him flat out that it's not going to happen. That you're not willing to be in a relationship where both people are not contributing equally,, and without kids there's no reason to even have one of you stay at home. When he says you're over reacting or plays it off as a joke just tell him it's not a funny joke and it's been stressing you out enough that it got to the point you felt you had to say that other stuff. \n\nYou have to be very blunt and straightforward with most guys. Most don't understand subtext and other ways that a lot of women communicate with each other. If you want us to fully understand you have to talk to us in Mannish.",

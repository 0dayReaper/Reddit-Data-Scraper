    "postText": "I (18F) loves physical touch, everyone who knows me knows how much I love being touched.\n\nHowever, my boyfriend (18M) of 6 months, recently told me that he doesn't like when I hold him in public places and to think back, he never holds me back. it's always me clingy onto him. hug him. holding his hand. he said I can only do that in private, but.. the thing is even on private he rarely touching me, and we always see each other in public places. so I can't hold the person I love the most...?\n\nWhat's the point of loving someone if I can't do the thing I love the most with them? and receiving the love I want. \n\nMy coworkers (21M) is different. he touches me even when I'm not asking for it, unlike my boyfriend... he always tickles me, pats my back, my head. always touching me (in an appropriate way obv) even when someone is looking. he didn't mind it.\n\nand I think, I'm starting to like my coworker more. I just can't accept that my own boyfriend won't touch me, while other people can. \n\nI don't know if I should be honest with my boyfriend or what because even myself is not sure of how I feel",

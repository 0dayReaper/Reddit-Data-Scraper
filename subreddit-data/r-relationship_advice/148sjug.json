    "postText": "My gf and I have been together for about 2 years now and she was always the innocent kind of girl. But about a week or two ago we had a long conversation and she was down to try a few things out. Things were great the first week or so, pictures, dirty talking, and sex. But just the other day about an hour after her dirty talking me along with some pictures she out of nowhere brought up that she didn't feel the amusement that she did before along with her feeling like it was becoming a habit. Obviously this hurt because how am I supposed to believe it's something on her shoulders and not the relationships? We had a very long talk about it and I thought that things were resolved but nothing has really changed and I feel stuck and hurt as I'm not sure what to do.",

You tell her you're at a serious marker in the relationship and that you can either put work into things or end things and start all over with someone new. That's it. I've never had a girl ever want to work on things btw, once the sex stops, it's over.",

As it would after a 2 year relationship. Feeling like you have to be constantly \u201con\u201d with dirty talk and sexy pics can be a lot, especially in an established relationship.",

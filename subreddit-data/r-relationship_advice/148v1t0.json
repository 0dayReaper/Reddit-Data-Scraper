    "postText": "I am always the one to initiate any intimacy, if I don't it doesn't happen. Typically when I do initiate she is completely game. We have talked about her acting on her needs but she has a really hard time talking about them and acting on them. I am trying to come up with ways to help. One way is to have us both write a few things down that we would like to either have happen to us, want to do to each other and any fantasys we have. Can you think of any more ways to help her feel comfortable in acting on her needs and coming on to me?",

She may not be in the mood until she sees that you are. I think it's important to have this conversation before you expect anything from her. If it's that she's more shy, maybe try starting with a code word or phrase you could use so she doesn't have to outright ask for it. It's a baby step in the right direction for her.",

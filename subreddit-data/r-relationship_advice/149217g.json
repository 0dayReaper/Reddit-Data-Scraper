    "postText": "\n\nMe and my bf have been together for a little under a year, he stays with me in my apartment, it's my apartment in my name and he's just here a lot. \n\nLately I've been working hella extra hours to make some extra money for the summer (we're going to spain together) and for his birthday. He really wanted new jordan 5s, so I decided to take on a extra job, work really hard for a month or two, and make it work.\nThe downside to this, is that I wake up at 8 to go to school, I come home around 3, then have work from 4 till 12. \nI come home and im basically a bag of potatoes. I work 35h at my fast-food job, 16 at the grocery store and do a pretty hard school course for social works. \n\nI've been really stressed lately with money issues, im really dependent on my income and don't have family helping me financially. \nMy bf isn't really good with money but he does work fulltime and helps out with groceries ect.\n\nThis morning he woke me up asking what time I was supposed to be at school. I answered with 9, and he basically pulled me out of bed because it was 09.10 already.\nMy bf started complaining about how he's really tired ect, he waited till I came home from work and didn't get enough sleep before work. I told him that he needs to go to bed on time and that its frustrating to hear him say that rn because I have 16h ahead of me. \nHe started freaking out how he can never complain and how I never ask abt his day. But I always ask him immediately when I come home, he usually just doesn't want to talk abt it. \nHe told me he's gonna pack his stuff and go back home, because he's angry and doesn't feel anything else anymore. \nI asked him if he's breaking up and he told me now.\n\nAt this point I started crying and he had to leave for work but he kept refusing to go. Eventually I told him to just fk go, because ill be fine and don't need him to comfort me. \nHe said he's sorry and loves me, and wants to see me tonight and cuddle. (I'll be home at 1 am again.) And talk about it another time\n\nIdfk what to do anymore, im tempted to pack his stuff, not bc I want him to leave, but because I genuinely don't want him to feel bad. \n\nDo I just grab his stuff and sent him away? \n\nTl:dr\nI've been working long days and my bf feels ignored/non important and wanted to pack his stuff, after a argument he told me he'll see me tonight and we'll talk abt it later. Contemplating on packing his stuff anyway because the pressure of this is being much, and I just dont wanna hurt him.",

Im done with not being able to do normal groceries or go out once a week to have a drink at a bar with my friends. Everyday there's money stress. I paid the trip already, I just want some spending money there to actually have a good time, and besides that, for the shoes I have to work abt 3 days more then I usually do, and Its worth it to me. He kinda figured out I was getting them bc he saw a not pop up on my phone for my savings goal, and he's extremely happy and excited for it. (He collects them)\n\nHe worked night shifts before and on those days he'd come home at 2pm and sleep from 5pm, I'd come home from school or work around the time he went to bed, I dealt with that for 3 months without complaining too much, only near the end. \n\nIf I want a comfortable life for myself and have savings. I really need to do this the upcoming two months, I work at the beach, its high season and there's enough work now.",

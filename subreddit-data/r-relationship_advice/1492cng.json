    "postText": "My partner has pictures on her phone of her ex. \n\nI want to preface that this has absolutely nothing to do with her having pictures of her ex on her own personal phone, it\u2019s hers to keep or hers to do whatever she wants with those. I don\u2019t keep pictures of exes from long time ago, but that is just my personal choice. \n\nHer iPhone popped up on a widged a picture with one of her exes. I didn\u2019t know who it was, and because they were very affectionate in those I asked who it was. She thinks it\u2019s an invasion of privacy, I think it\u2019s a normal question to ask of a partner. I didn\u2019t immediately think it was an ex, it could\u2019ve been a friend or a family member for all I knew, so I asked. \n\nShe didn\u2019t address it, she didn\u2019t say anything, she just immediately jumped at my throat saying that it has nothing to do with me and that she has pictures on her phone from 10 years prior. \n\nRegardless of the fact that her iOS just decided to put that particular picture up, what she did afterwards really bothered me. She sat there and started rewatching old pictures and videos and giggling at them. I presume she wanted to get a reaction out of me, but I didn\u2019t buy in and instead I just left it. \n\nThe deal is that she has really no regards, or acknowledging of my feeling whatsoever, ever. Anytime there\u2019s an issue she gets extremely defensive and her all demeanor is for me to either suck it up and accept it, or just to leave her alone. \n\nThere\u2019s no dialogue, there\u2019s no understanding, there\u2019s no consideration, there\u2019s just this is the way it is and if you don\u2019t like it it\u2019s your problem. \n\nThis picture is just the tip of several other instances where I felt like her disregard towards me was pretty palese. This obviously culminated in her feeling like she can\u2019t live because I always have a problem with something, without understanding that the problem comes from her refusing to communicate about anything.\n\nNow I\u2019m not saying that she shouldn\u2019t have a past, and be attached to it, but she could\u2019ve gone about it in millions of different ways, including it\u2019s just a picture of an ex, I don\u2019t know why my phone popped it up, but it means nothing and I understand why it could bother you. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m expecting too much, maybe I\u2019m expecting for her to care more about my own feelings than about her past, maybe I\u2019m just expecting for her to show a little bit of understanding when there\u2019s something that naturally should at least be bothering me a bit. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m wrong, and I\u2019m looking too much into it, maybe I\u2019m the one that really should let her live her life however she pleases and just be a stand by in whatever happens. \n\nTLDR partner has repeatedly shown lack of caring and understanding towards my feeling, and anytime is either deal with it or leave.",

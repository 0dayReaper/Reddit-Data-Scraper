    "postText": "I\u2019ve been together with my boyfriend for 2 years and we\u2019ve started talking about starting a family. I\u2019m atheist, he claims he is atheist but culturally Muslim and not even that Muslim. When talking about kids we\u2019ve had major disagreements:\n- initially he would not give in on circumcision but after I threatened to break up with him he changed his mind\n- he strictly doesn\u2019t want me to celebrate Christmas/ Easter although says it\u2019s ok to go to other peoples house to celebrate. I grew up celebrating Christmas/Easter and see it as super fun events and why deprive someone of a fun secularized party ?! He thinks it\u2019s total repudiation of his heritage\n- he is ok with me having pork in the house but doesn\u2019t want the kid to eat pork or eat from anything that has touched pork and same goes for himself so they will eat from different utensils/ pots/pans. I wonder if this in the end just will be a pork ban on me too?\n- he wants to celebrate all Muslim holidays/traditions and I\u2019m totally ok with that even though I\u2019m not Muslim myself. \n\nAre we just incompatible as a couple to start kids? I just find the pork ban on the kid so weird and having to not share my fun growing up celebrations with my kid. Also I don\u2019t understand why you have to be so serious? Why not celebrate it all and let the kid pick and eat whatever it wants instead of banning a certain meat and creating pork phobia?",

When mum cooks breakfast she makes eggs and bacon and dad makes shakshuka. Then as kiddo grew up they could choose which traditions they liked and didn't like and participate in whatever felt natural to them and believe or not believe.\n\nThat's what a culturally Christian atheist and a culturally Muslim atheist do when they have kids. This dude is Muslim. He wants his kids to be raised Muslim. That's cool, you do you, but do it with a Muslim lady or a lady who doesn't mind raising their kid Muslim. \n\nI totally agree her on not allowing pregnancy or getting married, where you and I disagree is that this will be a fight throughout marriage. I think if he's coming on this strong now I don't believe there will be wriggleroom to fight over it and op will be in a situation where she will need to shut up and accept his shit or leave because there will be no compromises or room to fight.\n\nLet's also not forget that while there usually are red flags (like controlling behaviour and refusal to compromise) in abusive relationships before the abuse starts, the actual abuse usually starts once the woman is good and well knocked up and her options has gotten extremely limited.",

I am curious how they handled these things so far though. Surely the pork and Christmas things should have come up by now? Did OP celebrate Christmas last year? How did the partner react? Is there any pork around now? Or is the partner one of those people who is pretty chill in his young adult phase but intends to go back to the stricter rules of childhood once he has his own children?",

You have an open approach of allowing the kids to experience both cultures (yours and his) and then picking what they like and don\u2019t like.\n\nYour boyfriend is insistent on strictly following his culture which does not allow you to follow any of yours.  I would guess you aren\u2019t living together yet, otherwise the pork issue and the holiday celebrations would,have come up before now.  He doesn\u2019t want any of your cultural norms like pork or a secular Christmas to be exposed to his kids.  I would also assume that he has never celebrated those holidays with you in your 2 years together.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about kids.  This is about you being a couple and him requiring you to give up your cultural traditions or celebrate them without him and any future kids (ie no decorations in the house, and you go by yourself to your family to celebrate Christmas and Easter).\n\nHe isn\u2019t open to experiencing your cultural norms.  He isn\u2019t likely to change.  If you are hoping he will reconsider at some point, you are kidding yourself.  Young people are the most open when it comes to cultural changes because they are finding their independence.  Once you settle into a routine of how you celebrate, it\u2019s harder to change.\n\nSo, you need to decide if you can live with his demands for the rest of your life and the lives of your children, or that\u2019s a showstopper and you end the relationship.  This is a serious incompatibility issue because he is not open to experiencing your cultural events.  It\u2019s ok to find this out now and decide, rather than 10 years from now when you are married with kids\u2026",

They claim they aren't religious or have given it up but cannot fully distance themselves from it. A lot of them make this claim when they fall in love with a non-Muslim/Westerner. So regarding certain things which stem from the religion, there will be no compromise. Especially regarding the pork. It's the one rule that for some cultural reason (not religious) they find the most taboo to break. I have known Muslims and some who claim to be former Muslims that drink, do drugs, have sexual relations outside of marriage (this is actually one of the biggest sins and goes hand in hand with murder and worshipping false gods), and the minute I tell them damn I love nothing more than a sausage, egg, and cheese from the bodega in the morning they lose their fucking minds. \"OMG YOU EAT PORK??\", HOW COULD YOU??? WHY?? ETC ETC. Seriously they don't even see the fucking hypocrisy in it. Oh and FYI he doesn't want you celebrating Christmas or Easter because of the blasphemy of it and the false gods thing. Honest you need to step away, because he definitely hasn't fully left the religion yet and in that state once they get older and ESPECIALLY ONCE THEY HAVE KIDS a lot of them revert back to it.

It's just a guaranteed way to alienate and subjugate their partner to their own whims and feelings.\n\nYou can consider this to be \"thin edge of the wedge\" sort of stuff and whilst it may be over thinking it to see it that way, just the fact that your are approaching it with this in mind shows you where your mind is at.

We are from the same religion, but he is a vegetarian and hasn\u2019t touched alcohol in his life. Initially he told me that he was ok with my lifestyle but as we progressed into the relationship I noticed I wasn\u2019t eating meat when I was with him. He later told me that I need to give up on meat while in front of him. I can eat when I am going out with my friends or when I am alone. He also said that we\u2019ll have separate utensils and he would want our kids to lead a vegetarian life. Whereas I want my kids to have complete freedom to chose how they want to lead their life.\nI have made the decision to call it quits as progressing with this will lead to resentment on both sides.

He said, he is something (an atheist), but acts and demands things that is totally the opposite of what he said. So, he lied to you from the beginning to slowly easy you bit by bit into HIS way of living.\n2. He demands you give a big aspect of what defines you as a person (pork your holidays). You are \u201eallowed\u201c to be yourself (celebrate holidays other than his) but just not in your own home and safe space.\n3. You had a big fight about something (circumcision) and only backed down, because you threatened to leave. He just backed down because you are not tied to him just yet. Just see, what he will do, if you are \u201elocked down\u201c by him through marriage and/or kids. That wouldn\u2019t be that easy to leave/escape anymore. He knows he just have to back down just yet and that he have to wait and have to subtly ease you more into HIS direction without ringing to many alarms in your guts until you cannot leave that easily anymore. Then he will show you his real colors.\n4. He doesn\u2019t think you are an equal partner or else he would be more considerate of YOUR feelings, YOUR culture and YOUR wishes as well and it would be as important to him as his culture.\n\nAll this religious and cultural incompatibility aside. (Which is another can of worms by itself)\nHe is telling you, what he thinks of you and your status in this relationship. You (your self, your wishes, what is important to you) are secondary to his own wishes and to what is important to him. \n\nHe is only \u201eallowing\u201c you things you want only by now. Those issues will resurface the moment he thinks, you cannot leave him that easily anymore and believe me, then he will not back down or go even further in his demands.\n\nI personally wouldn\u2019t allow that for me to happen at this point and would listen to what he is actually saying to you. If he treats you like this NOW it will only get words in the future. That whole thing sounds scary.

Hva received all my sacraments and all that noise. Going into things I told her this and she said I get it that's fine. In the beginning we'd have wine together and even smoke weed together. I let her know this is who I am and she was okay with it. \n\nFast forward some time and she has a religious/spiritual awakening of sorts. Cool, I already knew you're Muslim I have Muslim friends I get it we can make it work. The issue with that became she then began to try and impose her religious beliefs on me and essentially get me to convert.\n\nSimilar to what you described the conversation about our future and life came up. She goes we'll be married in the traditional Islamic way and our kids will have Muslim first names. The wedding portion is whatever however I'd prefer a combination. While I'm not actively religious, it played a strong role in my life and my family. So I'd like to acknowledge that in some way. Regarding kids, my name is particular to my cultural group. As such it's something I'd like to pass on to my kids. When she saw I wasn't budging on the topic she goes 'oh don't worry about it for now we can revisit it later when you see things better. I responded there's not much to revisit because this is something I'm very adamant about. She smiles and giggles and goes don't worry we'll handle it in therapy. I said handle what? A way to get past disagreements or a way for you to get what you want?' She dismissed it and we moved on. \n\nAfter that as things progressed she kept referencing me converting to be with her. Then the day after Christmas while she's asking me about Christmas she goes well when we start a family there'll be none of that nonsense in the house. I'm like what? She's likey kids aren't doing Christmas or easter. I'm like it won't be a production but especially from a family perspectives my kids would participate. She goes well you're not religious so why do you care if they don't celebrate it. I'm like because they can be exposed to things and be allowed to decide on their own when older. She keeps on going about how that won't be a thing. Essentially insulting Christianity as a whole while doing this(which is w/e but if someone spoke that way about Islam to her she'd lose it) and when I pointed that out she'd say she's allowed to do it because Christianity is shit. Eventually things came to a head and I asked explicitly what will you do if I don't convert. Her response was then we'd have to break up although I thought you'd convert because you loved me. Ultimately she wanted to change me to fit her as opposed to taking me as I was. \n\nYour bf knows who you are and how you want to proceed. Make sure you get a clear picture before proceeding. Religious differences of that level are not so easily overcome and can breed resentment and contempt",

If he\u00b4s tolerant with you now, do not expect him to be this tolerant once the child is here. As I see it, children will only accentuate the differences and it will strain the fragile balance of your relationship. If you want to stay with him do not have children. if you want children, do not stay with him. Been there, done that and divorced when my child was only 2y/o.",

Not allowing Christmas to me reads as \"it's going to be my way or the highway (the opposite of viewing you as an equal), my cultural traditions are to be respected (no pork for kids), yours are to be erased (no Christmas for kids) in our house\".\n\nThis goes beyond incompatibility, imo. Incompatibility is not agreeing on something when both partners have a reasonable stand, like \"no kids\" vs \"yes kids\". Not allowing you to celebrate your own traditions in your own home with your own kids is not reasonable, it's controlling.\n\nIf you stay with him, he will most likely introduce more stuff that's forbidden/mandatory, all connected to his religion that he lied about not truly caring about (to make you stay longer and get emotionally invested). You will not be equal teammates in rising your kids, he's gonna be the head of the household and you will have less say than him.\n\nOnly you can decide if it's a delabreaker. But yeah IMO after 2 years\\* he feels he \"has you\" invested enough that he can slowly begin showing his true expectations, it's just the beginning (like the pork ban, I would actually bet hard-earned cash that YES you will be at some point no longer allowed to eat it). \n\n\\*I'm of course assuming this all came out about now-ish, since this is when you are writing in.",

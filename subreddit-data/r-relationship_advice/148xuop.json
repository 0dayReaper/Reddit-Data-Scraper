    "postText": "Looooong story,\n\nThere were a lot of red flags when we first started dating and I genuinely believe I should have ran the other way. The only reason I didn't was because things were going well. At first. \n\nWe play games together, and at one point she actually got upset at me for lying about how much damage I did in a game... \n\nMe: \"I lied, I actually did X more dmg\" Her: *proceeds to get mad that I lied* \"I'm done, I'm getting off.\"\nMe: ?????? Wtf just happened??\n\nAfter some time of being together, she seemed to take things very personally (i.e. me wanting to spend more time with my family, especially during my uncle's current health problems), and kept trying to make it about herself more and more. I understand that you have to make time for relationships but with doing online courses, working, and trying to be openly available for my family it's getting harder to make another person a priority. I try everything I can to make her a priority, especially since we live together. But with a lot going on it's starting to get harder. And it doesn't help to have someone who isn't understanding.\n\nWe broke up once, but she begged me not to leave (even though she's the one who told me to go in the first place). So since then, I haven't brought her to visit my family -- it just doesn't feel okay to me. \n\nShe's also accused me of cheating on her after I found a purple womens comb in my car after giving it a proper cleaning since I got it from the dealership. I don't know where the comb came from as the only people I have in my vehicle at any time is my family and her. When I first found the comb, I grabbed it and immediately brought it inside and put it on her desk -- why would someone who's cheating incriminate themselves???? Regardless, it seriously hurt my feelings that she wouldn't bother trusting me, it took two days for her to apologize and say she believed me.\n\nLately, I've really been feeling like breaking up and just moving on but I feel extremely guilty about it because she's going through a tough time mentally and physically. She's stated, twice now, that she doesn't want to be alive anymore and I just don't know how to end it without something happening. I've been doing my absolute best to keep her mind off of it and I've even brought up the idea of seeing a counselor/therapist multiple times, yet she has done nothing to move forward on that.\n\nHonestly not sure what to do, I just don't feel like me in this relationship anymore. Especially with someone that constantly tries to make situations (excluding health/mental stuff) about themselves.\n\nIf anyone has dealt with similar situations please let me know how you got through them. I do care about this person, but I just can't see myself with them further down the road. Any ideas?",

She\u2019s actively making your life more complicated. Do what\u2019s best for you and drop her.\n\nYou\u2019re not trained (or obligated) to help her improve her mental health - so you leaving isn\u2019t gonna make a difference there. She\u2019ll feel like this regardless. You leaving just means you don\u2019t have to deal with her anymore.\n\nIf she wanted to deal with her thoughts of offing herself, she should go to a therapist or do SOMETHING to change it. \n\nyou should\u2018t hold yourself hostage being with someone you don\u2019t want to be with, especially if she\u2019s just saying that to keep you around.",

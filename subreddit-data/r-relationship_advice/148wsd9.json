    "postText": "So I have been friends with this girl all through high school and college, close friends but never quite best friends. She had a crush on me at one point in high school, and I rejected her. Things were fine for a while. Then later in college, the topic came up again. We had a bit of a rough patch, and then she asked if I thought we were ever going to date, I told her no rather quickly at the time. I didn\u2019t realize how much I hurt her feelings and ended up apologizing and said I very much liked our friendship, and we were fine after that. My reasons for rejecting her were mostly because I was scared of being in a relationship, not because I didn\u2019t like her.\n\nGoing on into the summer of 2020, we went back to our hometown because of covid and our college moved online. We ended up spending a lot more time together, mostly because it\u2019s a small town and we couldn\u2019t really hang out in big groups or go do anything. So for a couple months we were getting a lot closer, and my feelings for her increased. I didn\u2019t know if she felt the same way still, but eventually I decided I was gonna ask her out. However, it took me too long to build up the courage. A couple weeks later I went camping with my family and while I was there, she started dating some other guy. I texted her about it to confirm, then asked why she hadn\u2019t said anything about him to me. She said she was going to but didn\u2019t think it was a big deal. Anyway, I was obviously jealous and upset, so I just went into a dark place and didn\u2019t talk to her for several months. I know that it was immature, and she did nothing wrong because I had told her before that we weren\u2019t going to date.\n\nAfter a while we started hanging out again. It was awkward, but we just didn\u2019t mention the dark period and me getting upset. Eventually things went back to normal. However, I noticed that she would never talk about her boyfriend around me and even go so far as to avoid it. I ended up getting a girlfriend later, and I also just didn\u2019t talk about her around my friend. So we were just friends for a while and hung out and talked regularly, but we just never really discussed our significant others with each other. (Both of our significant others were aware of our friendship)\n\nNow, my girlfriend and I recently broke up. My friend has been on and off with her bf from what I can tell. Last week we hung out and I told her that my gf and I broke up; she offered condolences and was supportive and willing to talk about it vaguely. I tried to ask her how her relationship was, but I got the vibe that she didn\u2019t wanna talk about it still. So now we\u2019ve been hanging out more again, and things seem to be better than they ever were (friendship-wise). But I still think about how upset I got at her for dating that guy, and how I ghosted her for several months. I feel very guilty about it and want to apologize for it, but I worry it will just makes things awkward again. After all, I was the one who rejected her twice before so why would I have been upset when she dates someone else? To be clear, I am not trying to date her now and I think she is totally over me at this point, so I just want to stay friends with her.\n\nDo you think I should bring this up and apologize for it, or just continue on with the friendship without acknowledging it?\n\nTL;DR: I had a crush on my friend a long time ago and I got upset when she started dating some other guy.; ghosted her for several months. Now years later she\u2019s dating the same guy, I just got out of a relationship, and we are back to being normal friends but she will avoid talking about her bf around me. Should I apologize for the ghosting, or just not bring it up?",

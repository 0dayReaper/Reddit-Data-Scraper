    "postText": "Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bkft0r/my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i_broke_up/\n\nTLDR: My GF was raped. Wanted to abort. Talked to mother. Decided not to abort. I left her. \n\nUpdate: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blird0/update_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i/\n  \nTLDR: GF calls me, reveals Mum made her not get an abortion because GOD CARES. She wants me back and arranges for abortion she wanted all along. Some of Reddit think I'm a baby killer.\n\nUpdate 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/boai5u/update2_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i/\n\nTLDR: Mother tries to get me arrested for kidnapping or domestic abuse or some loony stuff.\n\n\nI just wanted to update folk on this whole saga. This will be my final update.\n\nA few days ago, the abortion was carried out. During the weeks beforehand, my GF went to a counsellor and talked to a nurse about why she wanted an abortion. She was also tested for any STIs (she's clear!).\n\nShe went ahead with the abortion after getting the all clear. A few days ago it was successfully carried out.\n\nThey went for the surgical abortion method, which involved using a vacuum to suck the pregnancy out. GF said it was pretty painless, and she was able to return home after just a few hours.\n\nWhen she came home, she cried and cried and cried. She says she feels like a huge weight had been lifted, and she can finally look to moving on with her life.\n\nWe took the whole week of work, and yesterday we went camping (it rained). While in the tent, she talked about how difficult life was sometimes, but she was really glad things turned out the way they did, because even though things were bad, she came out the other side, probably stronger than before.\n\nShe's amazing, man. Seriously.\n\n\nUpdate on the Mum! So my GF received a call from her Mum, who was asking if she went through with the abortion.\n\nMy GF and I have an agreement that if Mum calls, either hang up or give it to me. In this instance, she answered, didn't know what to say, and gave it to me.\n\nI told the Mum that the abortion went perfectly, and smiled as she cursed at me for about a minute. I then said \"How Jesus of you\" at which point she hung up.\n\nMy GF didn't find it funny...\n\nAnyway, that's it.\n\n\nGood luck to everyone in their lives.\n\nAlso, if you're going to message and insult me via PM, just be warned: I've killed ^a ^baby before.",

It's still kind of a big deal. It's still a sea of mixed emotion.   It's a bit like if you were to start making rape jokes infront of your girlfriend.  (maybe not that bad,  but still bad.)    Avoid the baby killing jokes at least until she's the one who starts making them comfortably.  \n\nAlso,  on the one hand,  stand up for yourself and your girl against the crazy mom.  But also,  don't do things to egg her on.    Stand your ground without widening the rift.  Your girl will respect you more.",

Him leaving would have sucked, but no one can say it would have been the wrong choice.\n\nIMO, don't listen to pro-life people who can not conceive other people having different opinions. \n\nDon't want to kill embryos?

I've seen hundreds of cases. While there are some concerning signs in OP's actions, I wouldn't say he shows signs of a \"textbook abuser\"\n\nTo classify abuse, most people rely on the Power and Control Wheel: http://www.ncdsv.org/images/PowerControlwheelNOSHADING.pdf. This is the most widely-recognized description of how abuse works. Basically, an abuser uses the spokes of the wheel to control his victim. This eventually leads to violence of some form.\n\nHere, OP seems to be emotionally manipulative (\"get an abortion or I leave\"). One could also argue that he has isolated his gf from her mom by being abrasive. But I can't really see evidence that he is trying to control *her*, just that he is setting boundaries of what he wants out of their relationship.\n\nI think that OP is very immature and a huge asshole who doesn't realize the pain that his gf is going through. But his post doesn't scream \"abuser\" to me. However (and this is a big \"however\"), abusers are very manipulative and know how to frame things. It's entirely possible that he is lying or manipulating the facts.\n\nHere are some signs that I would look for regarding abuse in this case:\n\n- OP making severe demands and being emotionally-manipulative (get the abortion tomorrow or I will leave forever and never talk to you again)\n\n- OP trying to make gf feel guilty for being raped, and making her think that she needs to \"make it up to him\" somehow\n\n- OP demanding that gf have sex or intimacy with him before she is ready (again, possibly guilting her based on her rape)\n\n- OP telling gf that he will immediately withdraw economic support (kick her out of the apartment or stop other forms of support) if she does not get an abortion. This is different from having a more orderly break-up.\n\nI don't see many signs of those types of things. The fact that his gf went to a therapist alone seems to indicate that OP is not being controlling in a way that indicates abuse.",

An abuser would have said he wanted her to have an abortion, but remained in the relationship anyways and used that as ammo to guilt her and manipulate her into doing what he wants. He had a limit, no supporting this rape-baby. He enforced that limit by leaving the relationship. When she decided that the relationship was more important to her and got out of her mom's FOG, she chose to abide by that limit and he accepted her back.\n\nPeople acting like boundaries and limits are abusive is part of what makes it so hard for people in abusive relationships to recognize it and either set the boundaries or leave.",

A lot of abortion procedures are relatively painless and event free, I've heard of plenty of cases in which the woman was able to just go home hours later feeling if anything just exhausted from the experience. I also totally understand the explanation of her crying. Given that this is true, her entire life has been revolving over this one incident and plenty of people would feel that their future happiness and well being hinges off of this one crucial moment. I can definitely understand that there'd be an overwhelming rush of emotions with the main one being relief. Not everyone feels as conflicted about their views on embryos and foetuses, her internal conflict based on that may have been totally overshadowed by everything else that she was feeling.",

Unfortunately the situation and stakes are pretty nuts so it didn't come out that way in-the-moment for OP. He said he still cared for her and the net effect would indeed be the same (he would probably still respect her despite having to sever the relationship). There's also something to be said about OP's motivations at the time: he still wanted to be with her so it's in his interest to act the way he did.\n\nIt's not a moot point but I don't think you can't blame OP for this.",

He doesn't owe it to anyone to raise another man's rape-baby.

No one forced her to pick either choice. Just because both decisions had substantial consequences doesn't mean she didn't/couldn't make her choice freely.\n\nLife is full of hard choices and ultimatums. I have no idea why redditors think ultimatums are the end of the world. Ultimatums just make it clear that the choices we make that have very clear and dire consequences.",

I don't know why, but something about this entire situation isn't sitting well. \n\nI feel like there are bigger issues at play here and it makes me very concerned for OPs girlfriend. I feel like there is more than likely emotional abuse going on behind the scenes. Just the whole way the story is being told and relayed gives off some very concerning red flags. I get the need for dark humor as a coping mechanism, but at the same time, the OP wasn't the one that was raped, the OP wasn't the one that received the abortion and the OP wasn't the one that ended up having a family fall out. So why make jokes at the GFs expense, which circles back to makes me wonder about abuse at home. \n\nLike I said, just doesn't sit well.",

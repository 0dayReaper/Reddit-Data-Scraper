    "postText": "I am confused on what to do. I was wondering if you like someone, and you found out they are moving to another state for a new job, would you tell how you feel about them or just let it go? \n\nOver the last few months we have gotten very close with one another and she has been opening up about everything she's got going on. When I'm in my office by myself she always comes in and talks all the time to me, and just sits in there. And when she's out and about she would sometimes call me when she's bored and just wants someone to talk to.\n\nThere is this one guy who is not the best, and hates that we talk a lot when we work together, and always try's to stop her from talking to me. She's tried making more progress to come talk while he's there.\nLike I'II buy her an ice coffee every time we work together and she always says \"aww thanks\" and sometimes says \"awe thanks that's sweet\". When I've given her the ice coffee to her and he's around he gives me a nasty look. And then sometimes I'll drive her to and from work when she doesn't want to lose her parking spot at her home. Like some of the ways she acts makes it seem like she may have feelings too.\n\nWould you tell them how you feel before they leave or just keep it to yourself now? Since she will be here till the end of August. I have developed feelings for her over the last few months.\n\nOther people at work can tell that I care about her and have feelings for her.\n\nThen like the other day we were talking when I was off and she was thinking about chocolate chip cookies! So I went over to work to make it look like I had to pick up a few things which I technically had to. And I made them for her and sent her a pic of them saying theirs a surprise for you in the break room and she replied back with \u201care you here????\u201d And then stayed with me the entire time and we just talked. And she even helped me put a bunch of radios in my car and then we stayed by my car talking for a while before coming back in. \n\nAnd then a few weeks ago she told me when her sister was going through a break up with her boyfriend that she (the girl I like) hopes her next boyfriend isn\u2019t an asshole Then when I\u2019ve drove her to work I\u2019ve caught her playing with her hair and her necklace sometimes\n\nThen it was was cute yesterday she saw the cake that was in the fridge, and she realized it was from my birthday two days ago and was like Omg happy belated birthday and her voice got all high pitched\nAnd she was asking me my opinion on things for her to get for her new apartment when she moves. \nAnd she\u2019s been spending a lot of time in my office when she\u2019s not working with anyone else. \n\nI can\u2019t tell too if she may have feelings for me as well. What would you think?",

It does sound like you are getting a lot of attention from her, however. \n\nMaybe, some time when you are nowhere near the office or even during work hours, say something. Just be open with her without being overwhelming. Something along the lines of it being too bad that you two got to know one another so well just before she's leaving. That you like having her around, you enjoy her company. Tell her without explicitly telling her until you can read her reaction. If she seems taken aback, or just thanking you for your words without reciprocating, then abort that plan and just say you value your friendships. Take the awkward edge off for you both.\n\nI hope things work out for you one way or another.",

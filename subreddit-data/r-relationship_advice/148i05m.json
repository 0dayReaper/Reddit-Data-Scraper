    "postText": "Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1438izp/my_25f_bf_31m_of_four_years_ruthlessly_insults_me/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=1\n\nHello everyone, my original post (linked above) really helped me understand how seriously messed up my relationship was. And I truly believe the comments I received have changed the course of my life. I\u2019m eternally grateful. Truly thank you so much to everyone who commented. \n\nI thought I would give an update. After making this post and reading all of the comments, I met up with a friend at a coffee shop and explained to her everything I explained in the post. It was my first time telling anyone all of the nitty gritty details of my relationship (apart from vaguely mentioning to my parents or to friends in the past how critical my partner could be, or how he would often get mad at me). When I told her, she cried. She laid her head on the table and wept. Seeing her so upset reminded me of the comments I received in the OG post. I didn\u2019t expect this reaction \u2014 I guess because this sort of treatment has become something normal for me. I now count with her support which means the world to me, especially since my ex (as I expected) has started reaching out again. Each time I get a notification from him my heart skips a beat and my stomach churns. I\u2019m scared of how he will react to me going no-contact. I\u2019m scared to block him because I want to be aware of his reaction just in case (what if he threatens me somehow and I don\u2019t see his blocked messages?). I don\u2019t expect him to do something like this, but my mind still goes to the worst case scenario because this situation is so anxiety-inducing to me. \n\nI feel more in control of my destiny now. My parents have peace of mind finally knowing that the veil has been lifted from my eyes. You have all helped me reach this point. Thank you thank you thank you, a thousand times over. \u2764\ufe0f",

What people are saying about getting another phone number and keep this one just in case but not read the notifications, is a good idea, also make a second account on your social media (add only the people you trust that will not contact him) and leave the old accounts abandoned but not deleted.  \n\n\nTalk to all your friends and family and explain that you've broken up and you don't want them to give him any information about you. You don't need to explain to everyone what happened if you don't want, just say \"it didn't work and we didn't end on good terms, that's why I don't want him to know about my life\".  \n\n\nI'm so sorry that you're going through this just because he's an abuser and a bad person, but unfortunately, now you have to think about your safety. Also, talk to any domestic violence organizations where you are, to see if they have further advice that they could give you in your situation in particular. Sending you a big hug!",

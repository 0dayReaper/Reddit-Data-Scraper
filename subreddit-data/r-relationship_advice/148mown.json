    "postText": "My boyfriend (32M) and I recently found out that I (38F) am pregnant. We have been together for 6 months. We had discussed getting married and starting a family eventually &amp; it is something we both wanted, it just happened sooner than expected. Some background on me... I'm a single mother of a 6 year old. The father is not involved by choice. He left while I was pregnant.\n\nHowever, since I have become pregnant, some of our conversations have really freaked me out and I am honestly considering ending our relationship. We have had conversations where he has assured me that he will, \"Support me in whatever way I chose to birth and care for our child after they are born, since you have experience and have researched all of this.\" But then turn around and say totally off-the-wall stuff.\n\nHOWEVER, this is an example of a recent \"conversation/argument,\" we had...\n\n**Me:** \"I know we had talked about you building a crib, but I wanted to show you something I was thinking about...\"\n\nI show him a few images of Montessori floor beds. One happens to have rails similar to a crib but without legs, as well as a little gate that can be closed to keep the baby/child contained in the space.\n\n**Him:** \"Why is that gate there?\"\n\n**Me:** \"I'm not sure, maybe to keep the baby contained once they start moving and crawling around. A lot of people have issues with their kids climbing out of cribs when they are older and they can fall or get hurt. This option eliminates that possibility.\"\n\n**Him:** \"My baby won't be contained by that, he'll be a ninja.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Ok... Well, this is similar to what I did with my LO. When my roommate and I both had kids under the age of 2, we had floor beds, made sure the room and everything in the space was safe for the baby &amp; used a baby gate at the door, so it basically turned the whole room into a crib. Then, it created a baby-safe space where the girls could be placed, in the case that we needed to take care of something (poop, take the trash out, etc) and we would know they were in a safe place even if they were crying.\"\n\n**Him:** \" I don't want to put my baby in a padded room.\"\n\n**Me:** \"I didn't say anything about padding the room.\"\n\n**Him:** \"You were talking about baby-proofing. That means putting padding on hard or pointy corners, latches on drawers, that sort of thing. Look up baby-proofing online and you'll see what I mean.\"\n\n**Me:** \"I've never really done a ton of baby-proofing. My home has always been set up to be child-friendly and encourage autonomy and self-sufficiency. I just keep things out of reach that are not appropriate for children to have access to.\"\n\n**Him:** \"I want my kid to get hurt. I believe that kids learn from mistakes and getting injured. If they get hurt, they will learn what not to do again.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Yes, but we are talking about a child that is the age of newborn to 6 months old. It's a parent's responsibility to provide children with protection from danger and a safe space to live in. Babies that young don't have the mental capacity to understand why they get hurt and learn from a mistake like that.\"\n\n**Him:** \"I want to raise a kid, especially if it's a boy, to be self-sufficient and navigate the world to be able to survive on their own.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Again, we are talking about children under the age of a year. They need appropriate spaces with limits and boundaries.\"\n\n**Him:** \"I don't believe in baby-proofing.\"\n\n**Me**: \"Ok, fine then. Let's just put some crushed glass, knives and nunchucks in baby's room and see how they fare, if that's what you would prefer.\" (obviously sarcasm)\n\n**Him:** \"I wasn't saying we should do that.\"\n\n**Me:** \"I know, it was a joke. I'm being sarcastic.\"\n\n**Him:** \"No you weren't. You think I'm an idiot and that's what I want to do.\"\n\nHe proceeds to say he is \"done,\" and leaving. Walking out of my apartment to go home. I asked him not to walk out on me because I do not feel secure when he does that and ask if we can just try to calm down and get to the root of what this is really about. The conversation proceeds to...\n\n**Me:** \"I was just trying to share something with you that I was excited about and it had worked for my LO.\"\n\n**Him:** \"You didn't say that at all.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Yes, I told you about how my roommate and I tried it with our kids and it worked out well.\"\n\n**Him:** \"No you didn't.\"\n\n**Me:** \"I did say that and I know I did.\"\n\n**Him**: \"I don't want to pad things or use safety gates or childproof anything in our home. I don't believe in safety. I went to a Montessori school when I was a kid and pushed another kid on this wooden walking beam in the classroom. He fell and broke his arm. They didn't set up a \"padded\" environment for us there. We learned from our mistakes and got hurt.\"\n\n**Me:** \"You don't believe in SAFETY? What does that even mean?!\" I just literally don't understand what kind of statement you are trying to make. When a baby is born until they are AT LEAST 6 months old, they are helpless creatures, totally dependent on their parents to care for them and keep them safe. If you take a baby that young and leave it in the woods alone, it would not survive.\"\n\n**Him:** \"I disagree.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Okay, lets just skip the car seat. We can let the baby roll around in the back seat. Maybe we can also put a bunch of blankets and pillows in this crib you build and see if the baby manages to survive and not smother itself since you don't believe in safety. Have a good night.\"\n\nHe drives home...\n\nAm I wrong to feel like I do not want to have a child with this person and/or parent with them?! This conversation felt totally insane and unreasonable to me. And since, we have had several, more frequent tiffs/blowouts of a similar vain since I became pregnant. He has also said he intends to send the kid to boarding school no matter what, even if the kid has no interest in going. I have lost all of my attraction to him or desire to even be around him.\n\nI need some feedback.\n\n**TLDR**: Boyfriend and I recently found out I was pregnant. He has now started telling me outrageous stuff like, he \"doesn't believe in safety or baby-proofing.\" I have lost all attraction to him and any desire to have him around. I am considering ending the relationship. I'm not sure if he's just talking out of his \\*ss because he's angry in the moment, or if this is a major red flag.\n\n\\- - - \n\n**Update:** After the responses today, he came over after work this evening. I asked if we could revisit the conversation we had about safety the other night so that I could gain some clarity because I have been feeling really concerned about it. He basically informed me that he was annoyed and wanted to walk away from the conversation. He didn't want to be having it anymore, so he got extreme about it. He said he feels like any time I disagree with him, it's fine and we have a \"normal,\" discussion about it. If he disagrees with me, I get upset and the conversation escalates EVERY TIME. \n\nHe said that every escalated conversation or conflict has been caused by me responding defensively or getting upset. \n\nIf I bring up a concern about the relationship (like did this evening) it immediately got turned back on me. I tried to have a calm discussion, and asked to understand what he meant. His answer was, \"Normal safety measures make sense, like keeping chemicals out of reach of children. But when I visited a friend's house as a kid, they had child locks on the cabinets and padding on corners and baby gates in the house, that feels excessive and unnecessary to me. I feel like \"safety\" is a cage that people put themselves in to pretend like the world is a safe place and it's more like imprisonment.\n\nI mentioned several things he said during the conversation. Said they concerned me, after which, he denied saying it (even though I know 100% he did) and then said, \"You're out of your fucking mind.\" I told him calmly that I think he should leave because that isn't a kind way to speak to me and I won't be gaslighted when I absolutely know he said what he said. So, yeah...   \n",

He'll never admit that he needlessly suffered by the choices of his parents, hence he'd rather let your child suffer the consequences of his tunnel vision.

Because you're absolutely right that he's thinking that all his trauma and his toxic masculinity standards are a rite of passage and that his child must feel the same pain in order to \"become a good and strong man just like me\" from your boyfriend's perspective.\n \nSure, you can try and fix him or hope that he makes as sudden of a turn in personality after birth as to when he found out you are \"trapped\" in this relationship, but most likely you'll end up subjecting yourself, your already existing child and your unborn child to whatever the hell is wrong with this man for the rest of your lives. \n\nIf I were you, I'd abort, even as a person who really wants children. It's just not worth the trauma that will be inflicted onto you and your children. \nYeah, he might straighten out a bit after being a parent himself, but most likely, the pure stress of having an infant to care for will bring out all the coping mechanism he knows, aka physical and emotional violence.

We have had previous conversations about the roles of men in society, things that he has felt are problematic with the raising of males and I definitely understood that he found it really important to instill mail children with important values and give them an example of a caregiver that takes responsibility for his family.\n\nThere have been times recently where I have spoken up about the intensity of reprimand or requests that occur with my 6-year-old and have also received an incredibly inflammatory response. He has admitted to being stressed and feeling under pressure since this news, but I don't know if I am just being overly sensitive or I should be legitimately concerned at this point.\n\nI'm also full of pregnancy hormones...

I usually try to kindly ask, request or tell my child to stop a behavior or do something before I get to the point of \"barking,\" or snapping at them.\n\nIt's not like I have never yelled before. I'm human.\nBut usually any kind of intensity happens after a very, very long day of child rearing or multiple attempts at having the issue resolved calmly.\n\nWhen I make the request to have awareness of this and try to shift the approach, I receive a pretty negative response from him. He says, he is harder on my six year old than other kids because he knows her and is how else is he supposed to take on the role of a parental figure if he doesn't have some authority and I undermine him in front of them.\n\nIt feels extreme to me. If I was being too harsh when giving my kid feedback or reprimanding them, I would want my partner to let me know and maybe offer to tag in. That's all I have done and a majority of the time, it has been without the child close enough to hear.",

For him, authority, dominance and abuse in one form or another are probably all the same thing, which is why he will never want to \"appear weak\" or like he has less authority by being an actual nice human being to this kid. \n\nI've seen with some of my friends and the damage it did to the family dynamic was irreparable. One of my friends' mom had a boyfriend that would command around my friend and force her to be at his service when the mom was out of sight. He wanted to dominate, not parent. The mom knew that my friend was deeply upset and unhappy by that man's treatment, yet the mom didn't want to be alone and let him continue to abuse her for over a year. She moved out at fifteen and didn't speak to her mom for several years. \n\nYou're the parent. It's your responsibility to choose a partner that is a good step parent to your child, and your child will see this as a failure to protect them from obvious harm. If you can already see the cracks forming and you see that he's trying to parent (after a SIX MONTHS RELATIONSHIP) by being rude and disrespectful, then you need to see the light before this becomes another one of these \"frogs in slowly boiling water don't realize that they're dying\" situations. What do you want your child to learn from this upbringing? Right now you're teaching them that being an asshole means that the asshole has the authority, and they will emulate THAT behavior in their own relationships. You're letting your child be molded into your current partner in terms of their future parenting style with every moment he's \"being especially harsh on her\" in order to establish dominance.\n\nI'm sorry for being so harsh but I can still remember the humiliation and verbal abuse my friend went through, even when I, a guest, was in the house. Some people are terrible parents and this man sounds like one of them.",

I guess I\u2019m against boarding school as children need their parents and parental guidance. I think I would feel abandoned and unwanted being shipped off to a boarding school. Both my parents worked when I was a kid and so for the summers I was sent to live with my gram 2 hours away in CT but my best friend lived across the street from my gram so I had a friend I was with almost 24/7 and I had other friends I would go and stay with. \n\nHe needs to pull his head out of his ass!! You\u2019re right a baby wouldn\u2019t survive being left out in the woods and the fact he believes an infant would survive is absolutely positively terrifying and disturbing. He sounds like a danger to this future child and if I were you I would seriously be considering if I wanted to continue on with this pregnancy and be stuck with him in your life for the rest of your life!! \n\nOp, I would not blame you for even a second if you broke up with this dude!! He doesn\u2019t sound like the brightest crayon in the box and I certainly wouldn\u2019t trust him alone with my baby or with any child for that matter!! And the fact he admitted to pushing a fellow classmate off a beam which resulted in his classmate having a broken arm is telling. If something ever happened to the child while in his care would def leave me questioning was it an accident or this dudes learning experience he\u2019s shoving on the child!! That guy shouldn\u2019t be allowed near a baby or any child and should be made to take parenting classes and if he still doesn\u2019t change his views on keeping babies safe then he should be castrated!!\n\nGood luck op!!

By your description this seems to be because that's how he was raised. So it's clear his misconceptions are at what age that started. It would have been more beneficial to not tell him he's wrong, but to tell him he too was raised like this when he was little and then discuss what you can do to bring this raising philosophy about at later ages. Now you just told him he's wrong and then explained you know better because you have previous experience. That'll make him feel left out of parenting decisions because you just overrule him with experience instead of giving him opportunity to discuss, learn and experience this together with you.\n\nThen you use sarcasm. You see he's hurt. He expressed you make him feel stupid and small. Instead of handling this in any way you jump in and explain why **you** felt hurt (him ignoring your experience) and then, just moments later, lay on with more sarcasm just for good measure. Now he's feeling hurt, stupid, not heard. He feels you override his parenting ideals and are not willing to listen what he has to say. He feels you think he's stupid. So he digs into his trench and refused to be wrong even when his argument gets continuously more ridiculous.\n\nI'm not saying hurt your baby to appease this man. But if you have the kid he will always be the father so you will need to communicate. And to become better at that I suggest that yeah, while you clearly do have more experience, maybe you could take the discussions less to direction of \"I know and this is what we do\" and more to direction \"how do we want to be parents, let's figure this out together\".",

Letting kids play and potentially get hurt in preschool is pretty different from preventing accidents for a less-than-one year old. Babies can die a lot easier, and their bodies are less durable than children who are 4. You\u2019re definitely in the right about 6 month olds. \n\nAnecdote: when I was less than 1, I was playing on the floor (I\u2019m Japanese and people sit on the floor) at an family get together next to my mom and adults who were having tea around the table. Someone spilled their tea, and hot tea got on the floor and onto/under me. I wasn\u2019t at the age where I could crawl yet so I couldn\u2019t get off my belly and get away, and I got what looked like big blistering burns all over my front side. \n\nI\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t learn anything from that, and more importantly, I just couldn\u2019t do anything about it. I was a healthy kid, but kids that age just can\u2019t crawl or do anything. My mom felt really bad about it for YEARS though, so I\u2019m lucky that I came away without any permanent scarring except a tiny bit of discoloration on my elbow. \n\nI think your boyfriend hasn\u2019t hung out with enough kids, and is misunderstanding the stages of early childhood development. My boyfriend tells a lot of \u201cwhen I was a kid\u2026\u201d stories too, but no one remembers things from before 2 years old. He regularly seems to misunderstand what the stages of early childhood will be like, and most of childcare until 6 months is milk, naps, crying, diapers, and spittle.",

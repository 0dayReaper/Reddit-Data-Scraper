    "postText": "I put baby-trap in quotation marks because I'm not sure what she did is the actual definition of baby trap, she didn't have a kid to make me stay, just against my will.\n\nSo my wife (32F) and I (34M) have been together for eight years. We have a little girl (5F) and a baby boy (2M). I love both of them more than anything and I finally feel like I have everything. A beautiful wife, two healthy kids, a great career, and a big house. The token \"American Dream\", minus the dog, I'm allergic.   \nWhen we talked about kids before, my wife always said she wanted two. I only wanted one, it would be easier and we'd have more money for vacations and stuff, but my wife maintained it's important for a child to have a sibling. I grew up with four and my wife with none, so I guess I understand where she's coming from. \n\nAfter our son and getting through the baby years and sleepless nights for the second time, I didn't want to ever go through that again. Both kids were very fussy and colicky. But when he was a year old, my wife began casually mentioning a third. I would laugh it off but finally she sat me down and said we have to have a third. I said no, we agreed on two, but she said she wanted *four* and three is the compromise. I refused and said I wanted one and we have two. She got angry and called me selfish for taking away her dream of wanting a big family.\n\nA couple days later, she apologized and we had sex. I noticed her drive increased exponentially but so did mine and I was happy to engage her. She was on birth-control, I had a condom, it was all good. Thinking back on it, I probably should have figured something was up, but I was barely handling two little kids and work on top of housework and yardwork and everything. \n\nI came home from work one day, while the kids were at their grandparents. My wife had a huge smile on her face and she sat me down and showed me a positive pregnancy test, literally dancing in joy.\n\nMy first thought was, \"*oh shit*.\" My wife noticed a less-than-happy expression on my face and started screaming at me. She berated me for not being supportive and this was a \"miracle from God\" and I should be grateful. I said I was sorry and hugged her and said I was super excited for the baby. My wife was delighted and later that night she was calling all family and friends to happily tell them the news. When she was talking about the nursery and how we'll convert my office into a room I started to get a little suspicious. Everything was so well thought-out and it seemed like she'd been planning this for a while. \n\nWhen she was asleep, I took the condoms out of the cupboard and ran them under water. Holes.   \nI nabbed her phone and saw she'd set a password. That was odd. Nevertheless, my wife has a terrible memory so I tried her birthday and it opened. Further up were texts with her best friend of my wife complaining how I wouldn't come around. Her best friend suggested \"arrange an accident\" with a winky face. My wife agreed and said she was going to come off of birth control. It went on for a little while, ending with my wife saying that yes, we *were* going to have a 3rd. \n\nSo I woke her up immediately and asked her if this had really been a \"miracle\"? She got that deer-in-headlights look and burst into tears. She wailed and then she got angry. Through tears she screamed I had no right to go through her phone and it's her choice whether or not she wants to take BC, the side-effects are bad and she was sick. She also brought up if I really didn't want a third kid, I should have had a vasectomy. She told me to go sleep on the couch, I laughed out loud and said no, I'm sleeping here, you're leaving. So while wailing she packed a bag and left to her parents. When she called the next day I told her I just need some time to myself. She said that's fine but I need to come around for our child. I told her I wasn't sure if it'd be \"our child\" and she cried more.\n\nIt's been two weeks since then. Governments recommended to stay at home and I knew staying home by myself while also working with two kids would not be ideal and she wanted to see our kids. So we're  in the same house, she constantly keeps on stopping me and trying to get me excited for our kid and planning the nursery and names and how happy our kids will be to get a younger sibling. I've been ignoring her entirely. \n\nWhat do I do? Staying home with her is bad enough and I don't know if I should leave her over this. I don't trust her anymore. She entirely betrayed it. I'm angry. But I have another child on the way.",

            "comment": "This is a huge betrayal by your wife and honestly, could\u2019ve be a deal breaker leading to divorce.  Having a child is a big emotional, physical, and financial decision that should involve two partners.   She\u2019s selfish, entitled, and manipulative.\n\nI would consider the following:\n\n1. Get a lawyer.  Discuss your options.\n\n2. Get screenshot evidence of the texts between her and her friend.  Record her admitting to tampering and lying with her birth control and your condoms.\n\n3. Get a couple\u2019s counselor. You can get virtual sessions during the pandemic.  This is important to either save your relationship or to help mediate a divorce.\n\n4. Get a paternity test.\n\n5. Be honest with people why you two are separate.  She\u2019s going to lie and be manipulative about what happened.\n\n6. Document interactions and record any fights with her.  She can\u2019t be trusted.  Avoid her claiming abuse or other things by having proof.\n\nWhat\u2019s most worrisome, and makes we worried your marriage is over:\n\n1. She lied.\n\n2. She blamed it on you for not getting a vasectomy.\n\n3. She\u2019s not sorry.\n\n4. She doesn\u2019t respect your view, needs, or opinion.\n\nIf she can\u2019t see how wrong she is and how much she broke your trust, hurt you, this marriage won\u2019t recover.",

Couples counseling with a couple in which one partner is abusive actually runs the risk of escalating the abuse.\n\nThe National DV Hotline offers a great explanation of that here.\n\nhttps://www.thehotline.org/2014/08/01/why-we-dont-recommend-couples-counseling-for-abusive-relationships/\n\nIt doesn't mean that couples counseling is never an option. It just means that the abusive behavior needs to change before that becomes a safe option - and even then, that change requires prolonged and intensive domestic abuse transformation programming.\n\nIndividual counseling would be great; I'm just wary because I regularly see couples counseling recommended on here for abusive relationships and it runs the potential of being quite dangerous.",

The longer you let it go on before contacting lawyers/therapists the more time she will have to convince you that maybe it'll be ok in the end. That it's really more effort to divorce than stay. But she DOES NOT respect you (she wouldn't have taken away your choice if she did!). You cannot trust her. You deserve to share your life with a person you can be loved and accepted by, not someone who will lie and manipulate to get her way, and then TRY TO MANIPULATE YOU FURTHER by giving you this \"It's my choice to stop taking BC\" \"it made me feel sick\" BS!!! You saw the texts, it's nothing to do with feeling sick. And she has a right to stop taking BC but YOU have a right to know that your pre-agreed contraceptive methods have been altered. OP, you know she wants 4 kids. \n\n\nCould you ever feel comfortable having sex with her again? Because you shouldn't. What's to say she won't do it again to get the 4th baby? What's to say she is even pregnant now, and hasn't just bought a positive pregnancy test online and is waiting for you to accept it, and then you have sex and it will have happened for real? It might be far fetched, but the issue is you will never know. Don't settle for this headfuck of a life OP. What would you want your son to do in your situation? Don't stay with her and condone her manipulation; people this messed up don't just manipulate once, they do it constantly. At least separated your kids will get to spend time in the home of a parent who's honest and a good person half the time. Not spend all their time with their conniving, manipulative, selfish mother and their father who accepts her crap.",

It can be less than helpful to let her know that you take legal steps in this situation.\n\nI usually try not to be the \"do this behind their back\" type but in your case, I'm iffy. She was already ready to break your trust, perform an illegal action and *screamed* at you for not being happy. She could at the least try to cover up, she could also escalate.\n\nSave evidence. Concentrate on that. Also focus on going through this time. When the situation got better, find a lawyer and let them help you. You need to get away from her. She doesn't care about what you want and would get another child - next time, four is the compromise because \"I want five and you wanted three\". And that she screamed at you? That is never a good sign. Get away from partners who scream at you *for absolutely normal reactions*.\n\n(Just to be clear: A partner screaming is always a warning sign IMO but here it's pretty clear that it's mindbogglingly bad because she wants applause for doing something illegal and is ready to scream for what is considered an absolutely normal reaction.)",

Actually it was rational, but all I knew was he didn't deserve that, and to at least protect him from that I stayed away.\n\nAs the years passed I realized I'd missed any chance of a relationship with him, so I planned to wait until he was 18, then write him a letter.  When he was 16 someone I was dating said, \"How do you know he doesn't need you right now?\"  I realized I was 16 when she'd trapped me, so I realized maybe I shouldn't wait.  We talk now, but I doubt he'll ever see me as anything but a distant uncle, and over the years I've come to really regret the choices I made.\n\nIf nothing else, for your own health, try to seek a counselor.  You may not want a relationship with this child, but you don't know ... that might change over time.  At the very least they don't deserve what their mother did either.  What she did was not out of love for them.  She probably believes she does but her beliefs are so divorced from her actions she's bordering on delusional.",

Not only was she being selfish, but what kind of fucked up mother thinks it\u2019s a good idea to bring a child into the world against the wishes of her partner? That hurts the child beyond measure because the father will never bond with that child the way he bonded with the other. She has seriously, seriously hurt that baby. It\u2019s selfish, short-sighted, and incredibly.....I don\u2019t even have the right words. As a mother myself, my heart is just hurting for that child. \n\nI personally wouldn\u2019t be with someone like that. \n\nBUT, a situation like this is above Reddit\u2019s pay grade. It\u2019s a delicate, ethical thing that only you should decide going forward. No one would blame you if you left her, but you need to decide how to proceed with the baby. I would really encourage you talk to a counselor (betterhelp.com and talkspace.com are both online options for the time being). \n\nIf you want to ask her to leave, you\u2019re well within your right to do so. You could give her a bunch of resources to find an apartment or call one of her family members to ask if she could stay. Maybe give her some counseling resources as well because you have to be seriously ill to think this is okay. \n\nI wish you the best. This is a hard situation and I\u2019m so sorry it happened to you....especially in the middle of a fucking pandemic.\n\nEdit: \n\nr/legaladvice may be another useful forum for you, including the links u/ebbie45 gave you.",

I didn't have a stable adult to take care of me.

As someone who grew up with a mum and stepdad, who argued all the time (and still do) and actually don't even like each other anymore, I can say that an enviroment like this hurts the kids badly. I struggle with mental health and I am scared of relationships, because the relationship my mum and stepdad are having taught me nothing. I have no idea how a healthy relationship functions and I am scared that I will accidentally do the same mistakes they did, because that's all I know.\nYou want your kids to experience a healthy relationship and you want to teach them to stick up for themselves and make the decisions that are healthy for them. You do NOT want to teach your children that it's okay to stay with a person that hurts you and disrespects you and your boundaries.\n\nThat all aside. OP has to evaluate his situation in a quiet moment and he has to decide if he could live with his wife for the rest of his life, because after what she did to him I definitely couldn't. But it is his life and ending a relationship is always difficult and with a wife like this might become dirty pretty fast. \nI just repeat what everyone else has said already: OP, call a lawyer, call a therapist, talk to your wife and make her understand how she betrayed your trust and see how she reacts. Because if she screams at you again and doesn't show any remorse at all, that would worry me. \nTry to get your hands on the messages she had with her friend. Better safe than sorry. \nAnd after all that make a decision that you can live with. You alone. Don't stay for the kids sake, because they will be okay as long as you love them and are part of their lives, which you will be either way.",

Go for a drive, lock yourself in the room with the router so it can't be turned off, hide your evidence in a box in the car if you need to. Get text records from your provider if you can't get back on her phone.  Tell her you want to get her a surprise. (Lawyers are always a surprise)\n\nIt's obvious she's cowed you into isolation pre corona, and will bully you till your opinion changes to save face in front of visitors. Tell these visitors you did not consent and this was rape, and you need help and then hard stop and walk away. Don't know your family situation but I'd be reaching out to anyone for help. she's got the monologue painted  to her friends/family as 'hes a neglectful and unsupportive dad, so help me make him be supportive and happy to be my sperm donor.' she's turning these people against you so that she has more people to wear on you and keep pressure to accept and 'be happy'. It didn't stop with no. 2, it's not stopping with no. 3, what about 4, 5..?\n\nShe lied and coerced you, and then berated you for being upset with her actions. She knew you didn't want it, and did it anyways. Relationships are about trust, support and unity. She's done the opposite of all on a life long issue. \n\n Tell her if she really cared and wanted you to even consider, you need space and time to process. You are absolutely being abused man.  Telling her no and walk away. Ignore her, and if not call the police, and start reporting her actions. I reccomend writing a journal with how you feel, evidence and dates &amp; times. A physical copy and a digital. Send it to a brand new email.  We're here for you. If you need to chat dm me and I'll send a number.",

It's beyond selfish to force someone into having a child.\n\nAnd she doesn't seem even remotely apologetic. She screwed you and just wants you to hop on board like nothing happened. I know you now have a baby on the way. But when she's trying to get you excited and all for a baby she forced you into having when you can't leave... she's totally delusional. She doesn't seem to realize the severity of her actions at all. \n\nI agree you need to talk to a lawyer. And then when you've got what you needed to down/ filed with them... you need to be upfront with her about leaving her. Even if you later decide not to (I personally would leave but to each their own). I don't think she's going to realize the severity of her actions unless you tell her that you're considering leaving her over this. And her reaction to that might even help you make a decision (i.e. blaming you further would really make me walk out). I do feel that it would still be appropriate for you to be there for your kid (as it sounds like you're already mentally preparing yourself to do)... but as of now you don't need to tell her that. Let her know that you have no intention of being there for her. You're going to move out and she can raise the baby by herself. She's expecting you to just go along with it and be the same supportive partner you've been with the last two kids... so don't be and let her know it.",

Extremely sad for all 3 kids but don\u2019t stay in a relationship because you feel forced.  The kids will feel it.  And please whatever you do, don\u2019t take out your anger in the 3rd child.  It\u2019s not their fault.  Do what you can to be a good father to your 3 kids and love them equally while rebuilding the remainder of your life.",

I have no idea if my mom did the same thing to my dad (or vice versa), but I grew up feeling unwanted. I wish I had been aborted. Therefore I feel sorry for the kid. I also feel sorry for OP and I agree he should lawyer up. \nOne more thing: if I were OP, I would tell the kids that I am not speaking to mama because she broke a very important promise. \nI think that\u2019s simple enough that they would understand.",

The new baby isn\u2019t so much the problem; rather your wife\u2019s ability to so quickly muster up a way to betray you is. Horrific. And frankly worryingly irresponsible, to say the least.

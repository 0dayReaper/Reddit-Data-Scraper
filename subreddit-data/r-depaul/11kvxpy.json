She made fast friends with her roommates, goes out to sports games a lot, does theater, etc. So it's definitely possible to thrive socially as a transfer student if you put yourself out there.\n\nIf you want to meet people, you should definitely look into the clubs. Make a DeHub account as soon as you can, which will give you access to info about all the clubs. Most of them have social media that you can check out too.",

            "comment": "hi! I transferred here my freshman year and now i\u2019m a transfer peer mentor for depaul because I\u2019ve had such a good experience! I was also scared that I would transfer here and not be able to make any friends, but I found the complete opposite. I literally love depaul, the friends I\u2019ve made, and experiences I\u2019ve had in chicago.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if you went to a state school or not, I transferred from a huge party school and it was definitely a big culture shock at first regarding the types of students who attend depaul and school spirit.   there\u2019s definitely a good social scene if you can seek it out. it does differ a lot based on what you wanna be doing on the weekends, but I thought the social scene was gonna be lame and I was proven wrong. \n\nI will say that in order to meet people, you do have to put yourself out there more. but I\u2019ve been able to meet so many people in my classes and clubs that are now my closest friends. there\u2019s also a rock-climbing club at depaul that meets at a nearby gym to climb! \n\nif you have any more questions just pm me, I know how isolating it can be transferring schools so it makes me really passionate to help others going through it.",

There\u2019s a bunch of little bands and shows that are cheap &amp; great \u2014 @chicagoshowcal on Instagram always posts for the week! The book club is one of my fav venues for that",

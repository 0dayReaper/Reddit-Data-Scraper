    "postText": " We are a startup Chicago band consisting of a vocalist and guitarist aspring to achieve an eclectic and dynamic power pop/rock sound a la Queen, Jellyfish, Radiohead, Black Keys, Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, T. Rex, Noel Gallagher High Flying Birds, David Bowie, Harry Nilsson, etc. We currently have about 5 or so original songs in the works as well as a handful of covers. Our mid-term goals are to get in the recording studio around July/August and start playing live around fall. We're looking for a musical drummer who serves the song but can really let loose when the song/opportunity calls, and also looking for a bass player that does the same. Ability to sing harmonies is a plus but not necessarily a deal breaker.  \n\n\nWe've attached below the link to a soundcloud that samples a previous project to help give a better sense of what we're capable of and our general sound; However, these are a few years old and we're not confined/limited to the style of these songs, and we're welcome to creative input from any potential new members.  \n\n\nhttps://m.soundcloud.com/user-532159707",

I haven't played seriously in a few years, but used to play small gigs around the city with no name bands. Just recently got back into playing a few months ago.\n\nSimilar tastes in musical styles.\n\nI can sing passable lower register harmony, and play keyboard percussion. Have my own kit.\n\nWould love to jam and see if we can work together.",

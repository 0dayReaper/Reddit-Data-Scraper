    "postText": "I'm a prospective international student looking to join DePaul starting fall 2023. I'll be joining CDM. However the budget shortfall has me worried sick. I have read that the admin, faculty and staff will be affected. How will this affect students, on-campus jobs and overall education? Please help with your views, any leads or info will be appreciated.",

Some programs are expanding even (ie. Geography is adding a combined CS program). I wouldn't worry about CDM being affected, in particular.\n\nResearch the professors in your prospective department and see what they are up to. DePaul's small class sizes give you direct access to some great professors doing interesting work in the real world. If you use that proximity to expertise and focus on your own intellectual goals within the broader world-class environment in Chicago, it can be a great school for anyone.\n\nIn general everyone should prepare for a pretty tumultuous decade regardless of your major. Go to school to learn to be independent and wise instead of checking off some academic boxes. We're all standing on quicksand.",

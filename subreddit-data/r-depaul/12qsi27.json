I just enrolled in this spring semester for an online marketing degree, but now I can't actually enroll in an online course?? I also can't find the online marketing degree listed on the depaul website anymore? \n\nIf they were going to change the degree from online to campus, they should've sent an email out to everyone in that major. \n\nDoes anyone know anything about this?",

    "postText": "Kind of feeling nervous about my commitment to DePaul after hearing about their 56 million budget gap. \n\nI got a full ride to university of Oregon but I can\u2019t stand living here anymore and I wanted to get out and move to the city of Chicago. I got accepted to Loyola and UIC but UIC is more expensive than both, DePaul and Loyola, and Loyola was too far from the city so I chose DePaul. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Is the budget cut big enough of a worry to change my commitment to DePaul? I absolutely loved it when I visited and I\u2019m gutted that they\u2019re going through such a budget gap. I\u2019ll be a health science major in the college of science and health, if that changes anything.",

            "comment": "So a few small things. DePaul isn't particularly known as a science school. Yes we have science program but its not the main thing for us. Our business school and cdm are the schools we lead in. This doesn't mean you can't, just know loyola is more of a science school than we are. So if you're planning grad school make sure to recognize that. \n\nAlso, I totally understand wanting to leave, believe me im from the west too, but the cost of living isn't a joke here. If you're in the dorms its around 3-5 thousand a quarter. If you live alone you'd pay a 1000$ or more for a studio. You'd likely need roommates to get it anywhere near reasonable if you're comfortable with that. If not I would highly consider Oregon. You might be able to live with family, you wouldn't have to work to go to school, and you don't have loans after. That's really big. Especially if you're doing science and health, which probably tells me grad school is your plan? \n\nAs for depaul. The university says they are fine, but realistically we won't know until fall. Final staff, admin, and other cuts will be finalized in after the quarter ends but before July when the fiscal year ends. Not to mention most students currently enrolled won't get their financial aid until mid to late summer, so we don't know if the cuts are going to hit us or if tuition will rise. I wish I could say we had better answers, but we dont.",

            "comment": "I think as someone interested in such an up and coming field like Health Sciences, I wouldn't be worried about large sweeping cuts to that program. The university is focused on its big money makers, and opportunities for big growth, like health. As others have noted, it's not known as being a natural science school first and foremost, but you can't deny the location, alumni connections, and just overall swath of opportunities you'll receive at DePaul. Great people and a very strong midwest reputation if you want to stay here. The good thing is that the university is starting to unevil clear plans for how to make up the gap - It's not that it won't be tough on certain areas and units, but it's the largest Catholic university in the nation, and I am fairly confident they can navigate through this. Welcome to DePaul!!!",

I believe from what I can remember and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, the federal maximum is 5% raise and if it\u2019s increased more than that they can lose any type of funding from the state/federal governments. Honestly, I would almost always expect a raise in tuition or room and board every year. I know when I started college in 2011 where I went to school in MI tuition with room and board was ~17k a year. When I graduated it was almost 22.5k in 2016. If you\u2019re curious, look at the tuition raise patterns over the last few years. It looks like DePaul average raise is around 2% over the last 5 years. The city here sounds like a luxury to live in but it\u2019s god awful expensive for a lot of things. But if that\u2019s where you want to go, don\u2019t let anything stop you! Apply for donor funded scholarships and others. A lot of businesses offer scholarships for just submitting essays. There are a lot of program specific ones too out there. And remember, if you decide it doesn\u2019t fit you, you can always transfer! You\u2019re not locked in like HS.",

She was on a full ride at our school but she didn\u2019t like the cold winters of the UP. Some universities offer scholarships for transfer students. I would call u of o financial aid office and just ask them if that\u2019s a possibility if you end up going somewhere else first and transfer in. I know a few family members who went to DePaul. They ended up transferring to St.Xavier on the south side. Too expensive, even in state. And they were going for nursing and st Xavier is a health science school and they both ended up getting a good scholarship when they transferred.",

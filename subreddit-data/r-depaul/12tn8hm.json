I chose to be an editing concentration straight out of high school, so I have much more post classes than film majors of other concentrations. It doesn\u2019t seem like a lot of other schools have this. Only other one I remember is Chapman. \n\nWhat schools are you between?",

            "comment": "The film school is really hands-on and project based which is really nice. If you go for a BFA (as opposed to a BA), you can choose a concentration (editing, sound design, directing, cinematography, etc.) which can really help you hone in on your interests. The school also has a relationship with Cinespace Film Studios and holds several classes there. There is a lot of high-end equipment, but most of the time, you end up with a Canon C100. Also, almost all the film professors are adjunct and actively work in their fields, so they tend to have a lot of current advice and experience.",

A lot of the classes for both winter and now spring that I needed were filled up before I could get into them, is this a problem? Or is it fine if I just take them next year? (these are major related classes btw)",

It\u2019s just laid out that way so that you know you\u2019re not a year 2 in a class that\u2019s exclusively year 1. However I may be wrong in classes like LSP 111 I think first years are required to take that.",

If I didn\u2019t take it, which it was a required major class- I would have been fucked and had to wait until the following year which is when I took all my 300 level courses and interned. \n\nFind a faculty member you trust and stick with them, some of the advisors SUCK",

Not to mention experimental learning can be filled with any study abroad. Lsp 112 can be filled with first year abroad (you can still apply in your sophmore year, but you're on the lower end of picking is all.)",

            "comment": "If we're talking \"first year\" classes in the Liberal Studies program, you've probably already completed Explore or Discover.  That's the only one that technically needs to get done freshman year (or first-quarter sophomore year).  WRD 103 and 104 can wait.  If your program requires Focal Point or MAT 120, there's no rush on those either.\n\nBut, it sounds like you are talking about \"first year\" classes in your major?  If that's the case, look up your program in the Course Catalog to see how strict/complicated the prerequisite structure is in your major. Most departments offer classes often enough for students to catch up if they miss a class out of sequence, but some majors' class sequences are more rigid than others.\n\nTalk to an advisor to better understand your major's pre-req structure and schedule your required-required classes over the coming terms.  In my experience staff advisors are better at this than faculty--but, it differs from college to college.  Talk to students in your major to see who they like/suggest.",

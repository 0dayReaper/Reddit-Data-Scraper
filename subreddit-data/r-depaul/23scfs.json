More of DePaul's money should be invested in achieving students who need financial help! Not these sack-of-garbage-sub-par athletes.\n\nAlso regarding Melvin, athletics REFUSES to release any details to the DePaulia, even though this is news we should all know about.

Athletic people with higher testosterone levels will naturally rape more often because they are in touch with their primal instincts. Athletics should be abolished so we do not nurture these traits. All those who exhibit aggression or misogyny should undergo rehabilitation or possible sterilization. We need to put an end to this male seize over woman's personal space and her right to choose her own sex partner. Depaul encourages rape by having an athletics program, and if you are against rape you should drop out of school right now.\n\nPlease don't be a rapist. Don't watch sports or attend DePaul.

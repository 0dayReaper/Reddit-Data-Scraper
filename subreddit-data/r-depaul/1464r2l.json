Not to mention this is a campus first before your neighborhood. So if someone decided to raise kids in an area that they knew young college kids would live in and experiment in, that is their choice. But for 9 months out of the year this campus is the home for thousands of students. Just because you're unhappy isn't our problem. This action is legal and a good way for students who are stressed to de-stress. You on the other hand decided to live near a campus, you decided to live in a blue state that legalized it, and worst of all came to reddit to be a jerk with the intent of making college students feel bad. Something you once were. This is our home, this is where we come to learn and try new things.

    "postText": "Hi, does anyone have any suggestions on whether to take Iyad Kanj or Tao Hou for CSC 421?\n\nI can't find much information about the latter professor. I'm enrolled with him now, but he doesn't actually seem to hold live lectures for online students which is making me nervous. Has anyone taken a class with him?\n\n(Correction: live lectures can be accessed through the office hours Zoom link).",

Huge discussion thread arose because of it and everyone was basically told to read a book with no reference chapters even supplied. At least three times he gave the wrong solution to the hw in class and would correct it with an email that basically said \u201cthe reason should be obvious.\u201d Idk I got an A- in 421 last quarter because he hard curves I guess, but feel like I gained nothing out of it.",

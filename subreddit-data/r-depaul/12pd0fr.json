    "postText": "Hi everyone. I recently got accepted to DePaul University for my Bachelor\u2019s in computer science. I needed some financial advise and your guidance would be greatly appreciated. Since I am a international student ( from India) I need to take student loan and for that I require a co signer. But I don\u2019t have any relatives or friends in US with a Permanent residence or citizenship or DACA. Neither can I take loan in India since a loan of that amount requires collateral and I cannot provide that either. Can you please guide me how to tackle this situation.",

            "comment": "Bro why u taking loan for bachelors, don't deprive burden urself with debt. When getting job, masters is way more imp for companies than bachelor's. Save money for bachelors, and get into some uni in India only. Self study during ur bachelor's in ur skills and work. If u save up enough, you can then do masters in usa, as u will only need fees for 2yrs. International student which can pay properly have higher chance of getting in compared to those who need scholarship or financial aid. I've seen people from low level uni in India, self studying and saving well, then getting to top 50 uni in usa for masters as they have skills and finances and don't need scholarship etc. Trust me.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone!  I'll be joining DePaul this Fall as a Grad student. I'm looking for housing now. I have no idea which location to search for housing. Most of my classes are on the Loop campus. I don't want to be too far away from Loop campus. As well as I don't want to miss the events at lincoln park. Could someone help me here?",

            "comment": "If you\u2019re talking about housing not associated with the school than just look in the surrounding north side neighborhoods. Like take me for example: I live in Logan Square by Fullerton and Central Park. If I need to go to Lincoln Park it\u2019s literally 15-20 mins on the Fullerton bus. If I have to go downtown I can walk (or bus) to the Logan Square blue line and take a 15 minute train to Jackson and walk the agonizing 3 minuets to the CDM building. \n\nIn other words your access to the red or blue line train trivializes your commute. The LP campus is off the Fullerton Red Line and downtown is by Jackson. Both trains go there and they do it quickly. \n\n+1 for Logan Square being generally less expensive than Lincoln Park (or LP\u2019s surrounding neighborhoods) and much less\u2026 Lincoln Park-y. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking student housing then I can\u2019t help with that. It seems like it sucks and is a massive rip off.",

You should also get a CTA U-Pass (provided automatically unless you opt out), which will allow you to ride the train for \u201cfree\u201d (there is a fee that covers this). I currently live in Lincoln Park and take the train to the Loop (downtown). There is also a free shuttle that will take you to Cinespace film studios.",

Half of this school just likes movies and there is a lot of non sense among the millions of dollars invested in this film school yearly. Definitely get your moneys worth tho. Just can\u2019t teach/learn creativity.",

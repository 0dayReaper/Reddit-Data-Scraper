This was the longer version of my tweet on Tech boards.  What did I get right/wrong?\n\n **Depaul's Identity:**  \n \n\nPlay fast offensively.  Per synergy, transition is where most of their  shot volume comes from.  They also use less of the shot clock than us.   Not ideal, since Tech's transition defense is in the bottom 9th  percentile.. just terrible.   \n \n\nThey want to get to the rim. The only P5 teams that generate more shots  at the rim are Duke, Rutgers, Stanford, Kansas.  Those are also the only  P5 teams that make a higher % of shots at the rim.    \n \n\nTight rotations.  78% of their minutes played by starters, 6th highest among P5 teams.   \n \n\nShoot very few threes per possession, similar to Tech.   \n \n\nThey aren't very balanced offensively.  Charlie Moore (Kansas PG transfer) does everything for Depaul.   \n \n\n**Depaul Strengths:**  \n \n\nOffensive rebound. Strength-on-strength match-up, as Tech is one of the best defensive rebounding teams in the country.    \n \n\nBlock shots/protect the rim.  3rd highest team block % in the country.   Another strength on strength.  We've had very few shots blocked this  year.  Depaul doesn't have a bruiser like Garza, but is very long across  the board. I think that's reflected by how many 3 pointers they've  blocked (over 5% of attempted threes were blocked, which is #1 in the  country).   \n \n\nIn the half-court, Depaul's defended pick-and-roll actions very well,  maybe the best in the country.  Probably because they are somewhat  position-less like us.  \n \n\nGet lucky.  On 69 wide open shots this year, Depaul's opponents have  only made 19.  That's top 15 percentile luckiest in the country (Tech  has been somewhat unlucky and is in bottom 33rd percentile).    \n \n\n**Depaul Weaknesses:**  \n \n\nThey foul a lot of shooters.  That may be the trade-off for aggressively challenging shooters at the rim.   \n \n\nTurn it over a lot, way too much.  More than us even.   \n \n\nTerrible FT shooting thus far.",

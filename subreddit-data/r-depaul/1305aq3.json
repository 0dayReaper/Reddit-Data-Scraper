    "postText": "Graduate students,\n\nWhat made you choose DePaul for grad school especially if you had other options like a D1 school? \n\nI have to make a decision by this Friday and I\u2019m so conflicted. I feel as if there\u2019s an obvious choice but not my number 1.  \n\nI was accepted into DePaul HCI program and UT Austin\u2019s MSIS program. I went to UT for undergrad so I\u2019m aware of how UT\u2019s system works. I would love to go DePaul because I want to live in Chicago but would cost 94k for the entire program compared to UT\u2019s 66K for their entire program. Obviously UT\u2019s name is bigger and holds a lot of weight but I\u2019m planning on staying in Chicago after grad school. \n\nDePaul\u2019s program is well established, a little outdated, and expensive. While UT has a big name and their UX specialization is fairly new when it comes to their MSIS program but the cost is wildly cheaper. Their program is interdisciplinary with all of their other specializations which can be a good or bad thing. \n\nObviously I can stay at UT and then move to chicago after but I feel like I won\u2019t be this young in an amazing city. I\u2019m currently 26 so 28 is still young but I\u2019m conflicted. Obviously saving money is the goal but I don\u2019t want I have regrets. Either way I feel as if I would.\n\nHow\u2019d you choose your program? What factors did you consider?",

But I had a significant discount (my undergrad was free and grad I spent 10k for my entire grad degree).\n\nI guess it depends on how much you want to be in Chicago. Idk I live here now and it snowed last week so. I'm just saying.",

Idk I'm a frugal person so I wouldn't do it if I were in your shoes.\n\nBut I also get wanting to start a social network in Chicago if you're planning to move here eventually anyway.",

            "comment": "I'm in the HCI program currently, but got into some other major universities as well. Honestly, in the end I chose DePaul due to flexibility. Around the same time as selecting grad schools, I got a really amazing job opportunity I couldn't turn down - so it made being a full-time student impossible for me. DePaul's program offered the best flexibility, and if you're working full-time, the online learning experience is so smooth and convenient. It also helped that my new employer could chip in for grad school expenses, so in the end money was less of a factor.\n\nPersonally I really like DePaul's program, but as other commenters have said - you can always move to Chicago later on after grad school. Not sure if this was helpful, but good luck with whatever choice you make!",

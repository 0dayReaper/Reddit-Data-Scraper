I've heard its very communter-based and that meeting people could be kinder harder than at other schools\n\nAre the budget cuts a big problem?\n\nI know that there are budget cuts coming for the next few semesters, and want to know if that will affect anything important to me personally, like dining options, gym equipment, and learning opportunities.\n\nHow are people there?\n\nare they nice, not nice, super left, super right politcally, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthx for your time and any insight you may be able to give",

            "comment": "There are a ton of students that commute, either from the suburbs, the other campus, or just other independent living situations. There are dorms in Lincoln Park (and some apartments in the Loop). But, aside from freshman year, not a ton of people I know live(d) on campus.\n\nI had a little trouble making friends as an off-campus student. It probably took me a solid couple quarters to meet people. Honestly, I made more connections through off-campus events (like internships, clubs, etc.). But overall, it just depends on how much you put yourself out there. \n\nBudget cuts are going to impact you differently depending on your school. I'd say if you have a major at CDM, you are probably going to be okay. CDM has some independent donors and is one of DePaul's biggest attractions, especially the film school. Otherwise, they have already started letting some professors go for the fall. While I don't know for certain, I imagine that the dining options and gym (at least The Ray) will remain the same, perhaps just increase in price. \n\nI've had a pretty good experience with people. It really depends on what classes you are taking and the vibe of those majors. As you get more specialized though, you often start having classes with a very specific set of people over and over again. Also, I'd say that the majority of people are liberal, especially professors. There is also very little Catholic influence, despite DePaul's \"foundations.\" \n\nHope that helps!",

You are competing with the rest of America for jobs though in Chicago...keep that in mind.\n\nIf you think you're going to go there and then come back home for work and life, I wouldn't do it. The \"experience\" of city life is not worth the cost. Come on vacation if you are looking for that...",

            "comment": "As a commuter student myself, I found it hard to make and keep friends because of obviously not living in or around campus. I think joining clubs is a good way to start meeting people especially those that are in the same major as you. I think people here are generally nice but don\u2019t expect someone to come up to you and instantly make friends. It\u2019s a bit of an anti social campus tbh. \n\nAs for the budget cuts, I am a junior going onto senior year in the college of science and health, and I don\u2019t feel that there have been significant cuts to that specific department. I\u2019ve heard that some research projects were cut but other than that nothing too bad. In terms of learning opportunities, I believe some classes will be cut just due to low enrollment.\n\nHope this helps!",

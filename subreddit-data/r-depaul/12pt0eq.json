I included course names, sections, and what needed to be adjusted. I did this so I could avoid speaking with my advisor because all of my Zoom calls with her have been frustrating or she has cancelled them last minute. When she responded to my e-mail, she sent a generic message about how we needed to set up a call. I\u2019ve given up. \n\nThe only advisor I correspond with is my faculty advisor. I\u2019m lucky that my CDM advisor has been extremely helpful and that CDM offers faculty advisors. However, the advising program at DePaul overall leaves many things to be desired. I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re experiencing these issues as well.",

            "comment": "This is going to be a little bit of a rant. I think most students will be okay if they reach out once a quarter with a zoom appointment through BlueStar to check in, but I had a few bad experiences. \n\nI'll admit part of my issues stem from my ADHD, and I tend to forget to reach out before the busier times in the year, but yeah I definitely had some issues with advisors. Veronica Dillard is my current advisor, was very very frustrating to work with, and I'm planning to change advisors soon. (Thankfully other advisors have a much better overall rating from what I've heard so fingers crossed)\n\nVeronica was very knowledgeable about how to do a lot of stuff, which is great for Freshman and sophomores. However, I had an issue with classes that stemmed from a new policy that she just wasn't helpful for at all. I won't get into details but she speaks very matter of factly and I felt I couldn't explain my situation because she speaks very confidently and I couldn't get a word in edgewise. \n\nI felt like I was being spoken down to, like I didn't know how the system worked despite it being my 4th year and if I tried to argue then I'd be just causing trouble. (Trying to show me how to replace a class instead of fighting for me and doing her best to reinstate it to my schedule when it was wrongly removed) I had to go over her head to get any help because literally nobody was able to solve it with how odd the situation was. Very very irritating overall and just a lot of work for something that should have been easy. \n\n(Also a small minor note is that while I'm not quite in my final year yet due to credits I have left, almost nobody has told me anything about how to do a capstone project. I'd have thought that I would be told but nobody's reached out afaik. I get that the expectation is that as college students we can reach out for help, but with how many students there are at the school I can't imagine how hard it will be if I've missed anything major because I was 'supposed to know')",

            "comment": "My experience depends on the advisor. For those new to DePaul, you're provided two advisors: (1) Academic advisor, who are knowledgeable about DePaul-specific info (credits satisfaction, substitutions, exceptions, etc.); and (2) Faculty advisor, who is likely an instructor for one of the classes you may take, and supposed to be an expert in the field you're studying that can give you insights into recommend classes for your career choice.\n\nI've had two academic advisors while I've been at DePaul, and both have been awesome. I'm a non-traditional transfer student, and they helped me get extra credits applied to my degree progress report (beyond what was applied via the transfer credits). They've also helped me get waivers for some classes and have shaved off about one extra year of classes alone.\n\nMy faculty advisor is trash. She's obnoxious, conceited, and condescending. Luckily, I know what I want and how to get it, and I have picked the brains of other industry professionals and professors, so I don't need to communicate with her. I had her for one class, and it was - without question - the absolute worst class I've ever had. The one time she reached out to me as an advisor, the message felt forced, and was more of a \"you seem to have things figured out, so I'm going to let you be\" than an offer for assistance.",

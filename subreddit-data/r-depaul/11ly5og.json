They charge landlords one month rent to find renters for.them.and handle the contracts. It was super easy for us to find what we wanted and I pass the recommendation on to everyone who asks.",

I transferred to depaul as a junior and lived in Wrigleyville, but the past year I've been in apartments by Philz Coffee in Lincoln Park. I suggest joining some depaul off campus housing groups on facebook to find a roomie!",

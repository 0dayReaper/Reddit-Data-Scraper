            "comment": "In no particular order:\n\n- Golden Dagger, Lincoln Hall, and Kingston Mines for live music (the latter is a blues bar)\n- Logan Arcade is a short ride on the 74 bus if you like pinball or arcade stuff; they have plenty of social leagues for pinball and Killer Queen happening every week.\n- There's also Replay that's a bit north if you want more barcade stuff, but they generally don't maintain their games as well. They do some fun pop-up themes all the time though\n- Wrigleyville is close enough to be walkable or bikeable, but the area is very take it or leave it IMO. If you're up for a generally drunken party atmosphere, by all means hit it up, especially if you can find some cheap Cubs tickets (as a White Sox fan, it pains me to say that, but it's a hell of a lot closer to LP)\n- Allende for some of the best al pastor burritos in the city (and they're open until 1AM weekdays, and 3 on weekends)\n- Butcher and the Burger for some genuinely gourmet burgers at not too bad of a price (might be pushing it on a college budget, but go at least once, it's worth the $20)\n- Good Games Chicago if you like board and card games, or tabletop RPG stuff\n- Local Option is a great punk rock bar with decent food and a very good beer selection\n- Parson's Chicken and Fish for some really good fried...well you should get the idea. Don't skip the hush puppies either. \n- Branko's right across the street on Fullerton is run by some of the nicest people you will ever meet, and they have very solid hot dogs, gyros, and the like\n- Oz park is nice to soak up some nice weather\n- Pretty much everything in the actual park Lincoln Park gets its name from: the Zoo isn't huge, but it's free, and they do great conservation work that's worth supporting, and the Conservatory is nice too",

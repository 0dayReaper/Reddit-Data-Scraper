    "postText": "Hi everyone.I am an international student and I was accepted in January for Computer Science but wasn\u2019t really considering DePaul because it was too expensive. Therefore, I was planning on committing to Drake University. But yesterday, I got an additional scholarship which brings my cost of attendance to 27k a year. It\u2019s almost the same as Drake. Therefore, I was wondering if DePaul is the right choice for me. I also want to pay for at least half of the cost myself by working jobs. I was wondering if it\u2019s feasible since I will head down to DC to work in the summer. So, I would love it if you could help me decide between Drake and DePaul. Thank you.\n\nAlso some other colleges I have been accepted into: Hanover College(cheapest), U of Idaho, U of Delaware, Whitworth, U of Evansville.\n\nI have also only recently applied to colleges like UIC, Loyola Chicago, Auburn.",

Also DePaul is a very diverse university in one of the most diverse cities in the US. You will find many internationals in the city of chicago. Drake isn\u2019t very diverse.",

    "postText": "Yo, what's the deal with the lack of security measures at our campus? Seriously, I've checked out other schools and it's security here is slacking compared to them. I've visited Northwestern, UChicago, Colombia to visit friends and even the local Chicago city colleges, and they all have way tighter security. Like, they make you scan your ID just to get inside the buildings, you know? But here at DePaul? It's like they're letting just about anyone stroll right in! I've legit seen homeless people chilling in the student center in Lincoln Park (no hate to them, though), and they looked drugged out. And don't even get me started on the Loop campus! Even more dangerous What's the deal with that ? Ironically only to enter the bathroom you need an ID lol and that was from experience today when someone asked me to open the bathroom for them since they weren\u2019t a student.",

They're so sweet and in Lincoln Park they're literally parked on almost every corner or driving around the block. \ud83e\udd70\n\n(I dont take classes in the loop, but from my brief experiences down there security is always next to the door.)",

No, you don\u2019t have to swipe in to get into university buildings because people other than students might have business and things to do there.",

    "postText": "I'm thinking of pursuing an MBA at DePaul. I like the idea of getting that Double Demon discount (I was an undergrad there) and it would be convenient since I do live in Chicago. I just wanted to get a take from current (or recent) students.\n\nMy reason for doing the MBA is a career change. My preference would be to do it part time, continue working, but then quit my job when it's time for an internship so that I can be in a position to make that career change. My worry is about job prospects after graduation (perception about the DePaul MBA).",

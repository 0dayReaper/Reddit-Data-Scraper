I know DePaul isn't known for their stem majors but just based on the research I've done, I like what DePaul has to offer for Environmental Science. I've seen great reviews on rate my professors for the ones from the env sci department and I feel that DePaul offers the best for me (compared to UIC, my other option). But again, I'm not entirely sure yet. Hearing about the budget gap has made me nervous and just being on this subreddit is kind of making me rethink my first choice.",

Meaning, classes are 10 weeks each so they\u2019re quite fast. You get a bigger winter break and summer break than other schools. I will say that sometimes I feel the fast paced nature doesn\u2019t aid in retaining information as much as it does in just studying to pass the tests.",

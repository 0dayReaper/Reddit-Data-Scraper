Or does anyone know around when the offers from DePaul come out? I emailed my transfer admission rep but have gotten no response. DePaul is one of my top choices and I just want to be able to fairly compare it to my other picks!",

I already knew that transfers don\u2019t get that much in the way of scholarships going into DePaul so I wasn\u2019t expecting anything mind blowing but I was fine with what I got. I qualified for like $11k/year for the transfer scholarship and I qualified for the DePaul grant, don\u2019t quite remember how much but not including my housing I\u2019m looking at about $14k a year give or take. If I do commit I\u2019m going to keep applying for additional scholarships though.",

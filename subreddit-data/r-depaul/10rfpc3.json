I decided to meet with the new one today and he was completely useless and basically told me to only meet with my first advisor. As he wouldn't be helping me with minors, exceptions,ect. Despite the minor that would be coming out of this new degree. So I was curious if this a regular problem for students.",

So, most secondary advisors will defer to your primary advisor when it comes to heavy-duty questions about graduation, adding a minor, etc.  However, your secondary advisor should have been able to answer all questions related to your double major as well as give offer general \"unofficial\" advice about adding a minor, liberal studies requirements, etc. (...just FYI, most exceptions go through chairs or deans; few advisors have permission to directly approve a substitution, waiver, or those sorts of allowances).\n\nOne thing I'm not seeing a lot of in this discussion is whether y'all are meeting with staff advisors or faculty advisors.  In some colleges &amp; departments, this makes a big difference.",

So both of them have the same leway unfortunately. Like I've seen friends who have primary marked with certain advisors, I dont. \ud83d\ude02 He really just didn't want to help despite the fact 4 out of my 6 classes for the minor I want would go into the major he oversees. Hence why I needed his opinion and advice.",

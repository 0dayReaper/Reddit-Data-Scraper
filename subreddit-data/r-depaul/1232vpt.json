    "postText": "So I was accepted for the HCI program for fall 2023 and I sort of have some questions I feel are better for students than admissions officers because I\u2019ve never been to the Midwest before. \n\n1. I\u2019m from the deep south, like deep deep south I\u2019ve never experienced snow and I think the absolute coldest weather I\u2019ve been in was about 25\u00b0, and my entire city shit down. So any tips for dealing with that would be helpful bc I\u2019m a baby about cold temperatures. \n\n2. Do people usually take public transportation? I\u2019m used to driving everywhere and we don\u2019t have reliable public transport where I\u2019m from. Is it easy to adapt to? I\u2019m still bringing my car if I decide to accept of course. \n\n3. How hard would you say it is to make friends as a masters student? I\u2019m really worried bc I\u2019ve never been anywhere I didn\u2019t at least know someone, and I do worry I\u2019ll get like depressed if I can\u2019t make friends lol. I\u2019m pretty extroverted though. \n\n4. Any areas/neighborhoods to stay clear of while I look for housing? I\u2019m from New Orleans/Baton Rouge so I know to keep an eye on myself but my parents are worried about crime since I don\u2019t know the area. I\u2019m also a girl and I\u2019ll be most likely living alone so I need to look out for myself. \n\n5. That being said, is University housing worth it vs. an apartment? I\u2019d be on the Loop campus and I\u2019m a grad student. \n\n6. Any other tips? I\u2019m sure there\u2019s lots of things I can\u2019t think of now so any advice for an out of state student would be helpful!! \n\nThank you!!",

I would figure out your budget first. \n\nWith cold, just acquire a solid winter jacket (doesn\u2019t need to be expensive) with pockets and a hat, maybe a pair of boots if you want but it\u2019s not usually super snowy in Chicago. Otherwise a lot of what you hear is overblown. Chicago winters are harsh but far from unmanageable",

It's not hard to use at all and once you adjust to it it's convenient!\n\nI don't use it for groceries personally because I live in walking distance to markets. It's not unreasonable to do that but I'd get a small roller basket or cart to hold your purchases so you don't have to walk as far if you do end up traveling for purchases.",

Most of the people you\u2019ll encounter after your class ends at 9pm are fellow DePaul students. You can definitely leverage the CTA to get groceries, however I would usually spring for an Uber, or get them delivered (especially if you\u2019re getting heavy stuff).\n\nHaving a car in Chicago can be a big expense.  Gas is expensive, parking is expensive, and there often isn\u2019t parking available at your destination.  Not to mention loan payments (if you have them), insurance, and maintenance costs.  Often times, taking the money you would\u2019ve spent on a car and applying it towards Uber is cheaper - unless you\u2019re planning on frequent trips outside of the city.",

Now it's not too bad except for a few days each winter.\n\n2. I live in an apartment near Belmont just north of DePaul's Lincoln Park campus, and I take it everywhere if it's not in walking distance. It's usually half an hour to get to the downtown campus so it's usually reliable and efficient. There was a period of delayed trains last year and might happen again but at the moment it's not a problem.\n\n3. I'm not a master's student so I can't say for sure but I've made some good friends at DePaul over the few years so far. I'm introverted and it still worked out because of group projects or other people reaching out to me.\n\n4. I love north of the Lincoln Park campus, and that's a very safe area near Lakeview/Boystown. Unfortunately I'm not familiar with unsafe areas by name because I try to avoid them. I know the further south/a bit west you get (especially past the loop) it gets much less safe.\n\n5. My friend lives on campus in the loop and loves it. I know she's looking to move out to an apartment elsewhere both for cheaper prices and to not have to move out over the summer or anything, so I think it's very nice!\n\n\nI can't think of too much else at the moment",

You will be paying an insane amount of money just to have your car close by or you can leave it at the Lincoln park campus and take CTA 20 minutes to get to it. IMO it is worth having a car here but not if you are only going to school in the loop and especially if you are living in the loop. I stayed at the university center (the only housing option for DePaul graduate students wanting to live in university housing) my first quarter as a masters student and it was awful. It can be very expensive if you want a unit with your own room and like I said before parking is insanely expensive near there. I would highly recommend just getting an apartment anywhere before you consider staying in the university center. It is cheaper to get an Airbnb the whole time you are here than to get a 4 bedroom unit with your own room at the university center.",

Most students live on the north/northwest side, as even if you're primarily Loop, you may still find reasons to go to the Lincoln Park campus from time to time. I've lived in Lakeview, Lincoln Park, Uptown, and Ravenswood, and have enjoyed my time there. Also lived downtown for a year (Loop/South Loop, not far from the Sears Tower), which was fine, but there were no grocery stores nearby and stores/restaurants mostly closed after business hours and on the weekends.\n5. Honestly, as a grad student it's probably not worth it to do student housing. Most undergrads end up getting apartments by junior/senior year.\n6. Do all the touristy things at least once :)",

There\u2019s a couple of hobbies I have that require a commute and I personally don\u2019t feel entirely safe taking CTA that late and that far. I think if you can find a place with a good deal on parking, then absolutely bring your car. Otherwise it\u2019s ROBBERY, places usually charge somewhere around $200/month in a garage parking lot. Hope you get lucky and find an apartment with parking!!",

And always remember layering is key. \n2. Yes. The public transport is pretty good in Chicago. And the loop campus is train station right next to it. \n3. I barely knew anyone when I joined DePaul too. But I had a campus job and made some friends during my classes too. \n4. You can look at apartments in Lincoln park. Wicker park. Logan square. Gold coast maybe? Maybe something in the loop as well. I remember they had apartments around the loop campus where tons of people stayed. Just make sure it's close to the train station or a bus stop that'll bring you to the loop. \n5. I would get an apartment of your own. Look into furnished ones around the loop if you don't wanna furnish it. But honestly it comes down to whatever would suit you best. \n \nYou can message me with any questions. Happy to help :)",

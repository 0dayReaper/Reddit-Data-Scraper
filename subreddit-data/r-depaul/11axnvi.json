            "comment": "Hi! \nTheres a facebook page called depaul housing, click to join it and upload a message. Some people are looking for people to move in, some are looking for people to find a place with. \n\nIf you're taking the trains heres my list.\nAreas, Lincoln park, lovely but expensive and kinda a food desert. Diversy, expensive kinda near a trader joes. Wellington still expensive and near trader joes. Belmont still expensive but target grocery. Addison, nice area. If you live between Addison red line and Southport brown line you'll live right next to a jewel. But it can be expensive. Sheridan don't recommend. Food desert. Wilson is a crappy area. Bryn Mawr is a crappy area. Thorndale and Granville is a pretty nice area. Right on top of the Aldi. The dream right there, but expensive because its close to loyola university. Loyola expensive but still close to target. Morse and Jarvis are both food deserts. Not the best area, but again, food is not close! Howard, horrible area. If you see an area labeled Juneway territs to live off of, don't. Its cheap because there are shootings there all the time. \n\nI dont recommend skokie purely because you have to transfer trains at Howard and their trains don't run on the weekends. Evanston I do recommend, but your commute becomes long especially if you don't take the rush. But most areas in evanston are good, but a bit expensive. They're is a rush that rush in the morning and evenings m-f. It's the purple line which does go to Fullerton (lincoln parks campus) and right in front  of the CDM.",

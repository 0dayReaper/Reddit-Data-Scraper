Either you think you writing is trash then start in the intro 103 course of you think you're semi decent and go into 104. \n\nMath on the other hand had some questions. I placed hella low, because I suck at math and hadn't taken a math class in like four years. but depending on what you're doing the higher the better. It just means less classes depending on your degree. But overall isn't not that hard. Just simple questions",

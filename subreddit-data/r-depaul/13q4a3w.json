So the university does a terrible job acknowledging this and admissions doesn't mention it at all. \n\nDePaul is mainly a commuter school, which means most students pop in, take their classes, than dip off campus. This makes it insanely hard for anyone to build strong friendships or connections because most people don't life on campus. Hell I live 40 mins away by train. This means a lot of people don't plan for events or other things, which means connections are hard to make. As a transfer this can feel isolating but there are ways to combat this. In the fall go see which clubs are gonna be out on the quad, go see which clubs are on dehub (online form for clubs and events) and join some. We have defrag which is a video game related club (they're doing geek till dawn this weekend, which means Friday at 6pm everyone goes to the CDM, plays games, watches anime, eats pizza, then gets locked inside at 11pm and rides out the night until 6am. It sounds like fun.) league of legends has a club, there a karate club, boxing club, cooking club, model UN club, and more. I encourage you to pick 1 or 2 and get active. You'll build friends a lot faster.\n\nI also encourage you to offer your snap out a lot to your classmates so you can connect. Then tell them about events you are going to and ask them to come. People love being invited for things, this doesn't always mean they will come, but you'll find out quick if they are interested in being friends like this.",

Growing up is really hard and growing pains suck. You thought growing up would be different and easier. Now you have responsibilities and its hard, you're confused  and worried and everyone says you're an adult now. Instead give yourself a break. Remember life is hard. Remember you are doing your best. Remember to take long walks, remember its okay to just zone out and relax. You can do things at your own pace, just one day at a a time. Because its okay, you don't need to be so hard on yourself.

Chicago is the 3rd largest city in the country and a lot goes on here. The politics are certainly going to be different. If you're from the rural South you likely are from a place that is heavy in Republican leaders. Chicago is the opposite, we are very heavy democrats here. Obviously you're allowed to have your preference, no worries there, but remember the opinions here will be different. Its certainly easy to put your foot in your mouth when speaking to someone, I did a bunch of times with small things and didn't remotely realize these were the differences until it was to late and someone was upset. So my tip, be mindful, show grace, and be open minded to differences. You never know what you might actually agree with until you speak to someone. \n\nAs for education, DePaul is a great place for computer science. My roommate, one of my best friends, and my older sibling all graduated with a computer science degree. It was hard, but they worked hard for it. I advice you to take advantage of thr CDM's (CDM is your college name, College of Computing and digital media.) free tutors for your classes. \n\nI also advice you to be careful with your class schedule. The major itself for comp science is 100 credits. This is a lot and doesn't leave much room for fun outside your open electives and learning domains. My friends used to refer to their open electives and learning domains as their sanity courses because they needed a small reprieve from the hell of their science courses. So, because you have a lot of comp sci ahead of you, I highly recommend 2 degree related classes than two elective options. It gives you mercy when you need it. I also want you acknowledge that some of you low level ones are gonna be especially hard because they are weeder classes. (classes that are designed to scare students out of the heavily competive majors. In CSH its Bio, Chem, and PHY for example.) You need to be patient with yourself, ask for help when you need it, and remember that this is new to you. \n\nI also want you to acknowledge you have some great options with courses that are fun too. We have requirements called LSP 112 if you'd like you can fill this with a first year abroad, (FYR) trip. These trips normally need to be signed up for in the fall and are for freshman. DePaul does offer scholarships for all of their trips btw. You can also put a study abroad in your experimental learning and a few other places. \n\nAs for the city. You are right about the fast pace, but as someone who was from a slower pace it can be hard. The days might blur together, it might feel overwhelming. I advice you to be patient with yourself, remember that this is new. That it is okay to need a moment, that you can take a walk to relax. A lot of people find comfort sitting on the sand at the beach as it's grounding. Some people find comfort on the 4th floor of the ray as the windows show off the city. No matter how you find your comfort remember that you are doing your best, that this is different, its new, its scary, and that can be uncomfortable. But you do have this. You can do it, but not if you're not going to be patient with yourself. Give yourself time to adjust, let yourself grow, and understand college has many ups and downs, but you have this.",

The vast majority of students move off campus after their first year because its ridiculously over priced and is not worth it. Hell a studio is almost cheaper than the dorms.\n\nI dont recommend the dorms. No matter how much you want to make friends I dont recommend living in an over prices shoe box with another person.\n\nIf you want to connect with other depaul students and live with them I recommend joining the depaul housing facebook page and seeing who needs a roommate. This will likely promise you your own bedroom and give you the ability to connect with other students. \n\nI won't say this won't be stressful, living with new people who are different than you is hard. So you'll need to be open minded and remember that there will be challenges, but hopefully you walk away with connections.",

Not only is the Jarvis School of Digital media in a great spot, its in the business district of the city, but its on the train. \n\nWe also have a few fun options. One is a location called Cinaspace. Cinaspace is a production lot where many of the Chicago branded shows like Chicago MD, Chicago Fire, etc are filmed. One of the Batman movies and some Amazon shows are there too. As a film student you can take classes there and work on projects. You can also rent film supplies and plan your own projects. \n\nAnother great options is a program we have called LA quarter. Students can apply to take a quarter in Los Angeles where their classes will be taught there and they can work on production lots. Whether you're going for screen writing, producing, or something else you have this opportunity. I highly recommend it and you will live with other university students there, which is great. \n\nI know several film students, they're very sweet and passionate about their projects. Film is simply a really well known depaul program, so I couldn't recommend it more.",

                    "comment": "of course!\n\nSo there are lots of resources available for first generation students.\n\nThese are two that I recommend. One is a program called trio and its in Levan 110? I think that numbers right, its 100 something but the only office door in Levan 100 area so you can't miss it. \n\nAnywho, Trio is made up of three branches, SSS, AMF, and McNair. SSS is for everyone. You get an advisor (only required to meet once a quarter), Advanced class lock in time, and free lunch for midterms and final. Normally they do sandwiches and pizza. They also do fun events and do have their own funding. Unfortunately from everyone I have spoke from, unless you are insanely poor and feel comfortable divulging you're entire life to them and begging, you likely will never see a cent from them. (horrible in my opinion, but it is what it is.)\n\nNext level is AMF, it stands for Arnold Mitchell Fellows. If you are a freshman you can apply for this program. Qualifications are first generation and a compelling interest in graduate school. If you are accepted there is a scholarship and a 2 credit class you will take each quarter for 1 year. They will teach you how to research and allegedly help you get published. \n\nNext is McNair. Regardless of AMF you can go into McNair your Jr year. The big catch is you have to want a masters degree. They will help with the GRE, they will help with you see colleges, and help you practice more research. Great opportunity if you want graduate school. \n\nNext program is the vincentian Service Scholarship. This is a scholarship for volunteering and earns you 6,000$ a year for 3 years. You just have to volunteer weekly and go to a few extra events a year. As long as you do you're set for 18k over 3 years. You have to apply in your freshman year and start in your sophmore year. If you are a freshman this program is hosted by the Meet Me At the Mission and flyers go up in fall quarter I believe. \n\nNext program which is outside depaul is America  Needs You (ANY). Once again, you apply in your freshman year and this program is a 2 year program. They teach you business professional skills and require you to attend a twice a month meeting for the first year and once a month for the second year meeting in the loop. They'll feed you breakfast and lunch and help you network, as well as build skills. You are offered 500$ each semester, but if you skip meetings or don't turn things in they will cut some of the money. That really does suck because as someone who has finished the program, you really do have to fight to keep the money. \n\nUnfortunately a lot of programs are steller but their are things that can be used in your favor so please don't forget that.",

That means that you can find courses that qualify for both courses or request exceptions. Minors on the other hand can be 100% the same as in the degree unless explicitly stated against. \n\nNow when it comes to CS and Finance you're going to be hell pressed to find any courses that cross list. The exceptions might be your stats course and my ethics can be cross listed into your liberal studies requirements. Other than that these two degrees you will likely have to take straight up. \n\nSo a BSB in Finance is 120 credits stand alone. CS is 96 stand alone. You will have roughly 76 liberal studies requirements. And about 24 open electives, you should be able fill your open electives with classes from each so no worried there. \n\nfinance 120 \ncs 96 \nliberal 76\nopen electives 24 (can be filled with second degree classes so no extra count) \n\nThis means you will have roughly 292 credits to complete in order to graduate with both. I do not recommend this at all. Why? 292 is the max the federal government will help with loans or aid. If you fail 1 class, you're out 4 credits on your own. Credits cost about 800$+ a piece. so that would be around 2400 out of pocket.\n\nI want to make this clear, this will take 6 years to complete if you want to do it! You can do it, but you will eat, sleep, and breathe finance and comp science for 6 years straight with very little exception of classes. I do not recommend this as it will likely burn you out badly. \n\nHere's what I do recommend, because there is zero way I would crush your idea and not offer you more solutions. \ud83d\ude04\n\nThere is a standard single degree that is a combination of comp sci and economics. Takes 4 years, but offers you a great guide into the direction you want. After that pull a 20 credit minor for Finance. Its 5 classes. I dont believe there is any cross listing  but this should be something you could easily fit with your open electives if you'd like. \n\nI also recommend looking into data analysis as a minor. There should be some crosslisting available between that in CS.",

If you have any interest in joining a team that plays for fun club sports normally open first week or two of the quarter. Theres volleyball, basketball, indoor soccer, and more. Flag football is outside and on certain quarters due to weather. Anyway  intermeral games are played either MW in the evening or T-Th. They split the games up is why the different days, but due to this the ray is most busy around 4pm-8pm. Highly recommend morning to early afternoon. \n\nAnyway, first floor has a pool and 3 racquet ball courts. There's also table tennis, shuffle board, pop shot, and board games. When you come in you show the front desk your student ID and they scan the bar code. if you're a commuter like me then you'll have your bag, walk to the other side of the counter and swap your student ID for a key. You can also grab a shower towel there and stuff it in your locker for after your workout. \n\nMore on days and times. Your slowest times are the middle of the week and early in the day or late at night around 9. The gym slows down around then and it fluctuates with the quarter. First 2-4 weeks the gym is always packed then students fall off. Winter quarter is the worst for this as everyone comes back with the new year new me vibe and tries to hold on and then falls off. \n\nMy tip for staying on track or attending, find joy in what exercises you are doing and remember you don't have to work to exhaustion. Some people like lifting weights, some people running, some yoga, whatever it is its okay to come back to what feels natural for you. You also don't have to do this every day, yeah its nice if you can. But its hard with classes or/and work. Just understand that 2 or 3 times or even once a week is better than not at all. You can start small, you just need to understand that things come up. One week off is okay, but just remember to come back because mentally working out is actually really good for us.",

You have to register online but there's normally snacks and other things which is really nice when money is tight. I highly recommend you use it too, because money is tight for everyone. I also detest their questionnaire as it makes you question if you're poor enough and if I have to hear another student say, but someone is probably poorer than me I'm square up. If you need it or simply want it, its there for you. \n\nNext is Trio. Trio is a first generation, low income, and learning disabled program. If you reach one of the requirements I listed above join. You gain priority enrollment for classes and pick earlier. There are also fun meetings and other great opportunities. \n\npersonally I love IRL. I make homemade dice there all the time. You can also rent out a craft container for the entire quarter for free. its lovely  \ud83d\ude0d \n\nNext is lockers. There are lockers on both campuses. if you log into campus connect they cost 20$ for the first year and 10$ every year after. incredibly affordable and I highly recommend getting one. I put snacks in mine and a blanket for the quad. \n\nAnother thing is if you need a mailing address and you're a commuter but are concerned your packages are getting stolen you can go to the 3rd floor of the student center and rent a mailbox. I think its 25$ for the year or something like that. \n\nIm sure there are more resources, i just can't think of any more right now.",

Make sure to have your own cooking supplies, keep it clean, and keep it away from others so it doesn't get damaged , stolen, or left dirty. Have a small, but nice little collection of your own supplies. So when you cook at home think about the things you always grab, then make a small list of these items. Small cutting board, knife, silverware, bowl plate, pan for boiling noodles or ramon, pan for saute things, brownie pan (because 2am emergency mid quarter brownies are vital) and a mixing bowl are simple items. \n\nMy apologies for not having a ton more answers, I would recommend going on a campus tour in Lincoln Park. Most of our guides have lived in the dorms so they are excellent resources. All of them are current students.",

                    "comment": "Hi!\n\nOf course, so DePaul has two options for their Psychology students one is a BA and one is a BS. The real difference between the two is that the BA has six concentrations and is geared towards people who are interested in counseling and learning about behavioral issues. This is a good start if you want to be a counselor or behavioral health expert. The BS version is going to be more regerious as you're going to take hard science courses like Bio and Chem. They have 3 concentrations for this, the most common of the three are Healthcare and Nuero Science. The BS version is geared towards individuals who want psychology as more of a medical practice. So if you want to learn why the brain is physically responding this way and gain a deeper medical base for your work, this is your option. I will say bluntly the BS option mine as well be a premed requirement as you're going to want to follow it with a masters so you can get certified in clinical psychology or become a neuroscientist. \n\nI also want to point out a different option you have. There is a BA option for a degree called Applied Behavioral Science. This is really good if research is your bread and butter. Let's say you want a listen less one on one with people and you're looking to study people as a whole instead, you might be more interested in research, which is great and something to consider! \n\nWe also have a neuroscience (BS) too. A lot of people like it, so if your interest is more on the brain directly and you're okay with a ton of science courses and having to pursue higher education after this is a cool option. (Random thing about this is there are a decent amount of computer science related courses that go into this course, so a minor or double major isn't out of the question.) \n\nAnyway, regardless of what you decide you need to think about what you want to do with it. Depending on what you want to do you need to recognize that like many health science courses you have to get higher education, so a masters. Not all paths, but a bunch that are directly related do. So if you want to a psychologist or counselor thats a masters. If you want to do psychiatric work, that's a masters and possibly more. If you want to be a neuroscientist/ doctor that's a lot more education down the road. \n\nIf these are the goals that's not a problem. I would recommend you consider looking at DePauls 1+4 degree options and see if they have psychology to clinical psychology. A 1+4 is a degree option where you can complete your bachelors and masters in 5 years. The trade is your open electives get filled with your masters classes but one year of your masters courses are billed at an undergrad cost. Whereas the last year is not. You'll pay the masters price which is where the university makes their money back. \n\nI will say that is only one option to consider, because the double demon discount isn't great (double demon is a program depaul offers for students who get their undergrad degree at depaul and pursue their masters after. They offer a discount, but its not a lot and it can be way cheaper to go elsewhere, so don't feel pressured to stay without checking your options.) But it is something you should know about and consider depending on the goal that you have. So remember you don't have to have all the answers right now, but remember to think about why you are doing this. What is your goal from obtaining this degree?",

So if you're to hot in your bedroom step into the hall, go to the student center, go to the library, etc. I will also say Chicago won't be incredibly warm by September, your hotest period on campus will be the first few weeks. October will cool down rapidly and November will be cool. Winter quarter most certainly will not be a problem. It will be plenty cold that most of spring quarter won't be an issue either. \n\nFor example, we have had probably 6?7? days in the 80s this quarter. Im expecting a grand total of maybe 10 days that reach 80 before the quarter ends. Like its 52 degrees Fahrenheit right now.\n\nSo realistically, your worst days are the first 2 maybe 3 weeks at best of fall quarter and last 2-3 weeks of spring quarter. The rest of the time will be comfortable or down right cold.",

We have a strong business school and so is the Jarvis school of computing and digital media. \n\nIf you're looking for things like science and health we aren't super well known for our sciences or physic majors. I wouldn't really recommend it. \n\nAs for liberal arts, any school would do unless you're aiming for law school. I might recommend something tougher. \n\nAllright now a few things to consider about depaul and your grades. You have a really good score, you could probably do better depending on what you want. But you also run the chance of a full ride from depaul which is amazing and extremely helpful as school is an expensive 4 year commitment. (if you're first gen let me know as I have more tips.) \n\nNow if you're in any of the strong categories I mentioned than there really isn't anything wrong with depaul, but if you're uncertain take the gap year. Hell I gapped for 2-3 years before coming to university. But I will say, if you think the gap year is going to deter you from coming and you might loose interest consider starting, but if you're strongly committed that university is what you want and you want your best options take the gap. Remember that apps will open this fall, make your list and apply for early acceptance, and ask to defer a year from depaul. its not a rejection or a commitment, its an opportunity to consider next year. When the apps start coming in look over the money, remember you can use your acceptances from other colleges to leverage more money from any school. \n\nof course, if you are content, if you feel that depaul is right for you, than please start your journey. But if you're questioning it, if you aren't sure this is where you want to be, than take the gap. Make sure you find the support in the degree you want, make sure its at the price you can live with, and make sure its where you want. \n\nI genuinely wish someone had given me this advice before I started. My SAT wasn't as strong as yours, but I had maxed out my schools gpa scale even with duel enrollment. For that, I find many of depauls courses to easy. Especially anything that isn't stem related. Frankly I can do 3-4 classes in 1 day and walk away with As maybe a single B every quarter. Hence why I'm on scholarship. So you might find your liberal arts requirements really easy. For me, I've only struggled with some STEM classes like IT.",

Just be watchful of your surroundings, know when to shut up and move away from the issue, and mind your damn business. If you do that, you will be fine. Also, do yourself a favor and stay out of the 7/11's by the cdm. They always get robbed and it isn't worth being in them. Im not kidding, do not. Just walk to the target or something else.",

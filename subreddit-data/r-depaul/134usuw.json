    "postText": "Can anyone share their experience with summer courses? I might have to take PHY155 (6/12- 7/16) and PHY156 (7/17- 8/20) over the summer to get my gen physics sequence out of the way, but I'm honestly kinda worried about being burnt out since these classes are 4 hours a day, 5 days a week (lecture + lab) and fall quarter starts like two weeks later. But I might not be able to graduate on time if I don't do this. \n\nI'm gonna visit depaul central for financial aid but how was your experience with summer courses? Did anyone take their required courses at a community college over the summer instead? Thx",

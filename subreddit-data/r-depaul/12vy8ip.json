    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019m a freshman transfer admit to DePaul and Loyola for my sophomore year. I\u2019m struggling with the choice between the two schools. I\u2019m a history major with a French minor at the moment, though I also have an interest in Chinese language, film, and possibly business.\n\nIf I attended DePaul I plan to be a part of the honors program (I was a part of a similar honors program at my previous school and I really like the environment and coursework). \n \nAt Loyola my honors credits didn\u2019t transfer as well and so I\u2019d have to double up next year if I wanted to do their program, and so I do not plan to do theirs. \n\nBoth schools have offered similar financial deals and so it\u2019s really a question of academics/quality of life for me. If anyone has any comments about either schools history program, honors program, student-professor relations, or any general comments that would be appreciated, thanks!",

            "comment": "I majored in History at Depaul recently. For what its worth, I was very impressed with the faculty in the history department. Rather than simply teaching history material, I felt that they taught me how to be a historian. Especially in the higher level classes, I learned how to do historical research and analysis/synthesis, which is a godsend right now during my law school career. I did several independent study courses to finish my graduation requirements, and the faculty was incredibly helpful. In particular, I recommend Professor Mockaitis for whatever classes you can manage to sign up for.",

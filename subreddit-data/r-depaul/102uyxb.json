I\u2019m making this post for 2 reasons\nA) so I can copy and paste it into a reply when someone inevitably asks me something I have answered over 100 times \nB) So you can read it and not ask these questions \n\nSo\u2026 FAQ and things you didn\u2019t know you needed to know\n\nWhich dorm is the best?\n\nI cannot emphasize this enough *live off campus if you can* but if you absolutely *have* to live on campus Oz hall. (Ozanam) \n\nNote: Dorms shake out to be around 800-1200 a month. If you find a close friend and a co-signer, you can easily find a nice one bedroom for that price! \n\nIs the food bad? \nIt depends on what you mean by bad. It\u2019s not terrible. It\u2019s actually quite good. It\u2019s just the same thing every single day. It can get old. If you\u2019re looking to change it up, go to the loop, or if you\u2019re in the loop go to LPC.\n\nAre the redlines really that bad? \nIn the winter they get worse than the summer. If you\u2019re not from the city, travel with someone the first few times and give yourself extra time to take the brown line if necessary. In the winter, always take brown line if you can. \n\nIs ___ (honors) program worth it? \nI could write a very long diary entry about the pathway honors program. If you have specific questions about it ask and I\u2019ll answer.\nThe only reason the \u201cregular\u201d honors program is worth it is if you want to go to grad school (law, med, PhD, masters) and you have previous language experience.\n\nOther things that are just my opinion:\n\nThe little \u201cmini\u201d quad right between SAC and the library is severely underrated and beautiful. People might look at you like you\u2019re mad but it\u2019s a perfect place to study. \n\nIf you\u2019re wanting a study sesh that\u2019s quiet, but don\u2019t need absolute silence, go to the third floor. This might seem like common sense because of the way the signs are but I made the mistake for months going to the fourth floor to study when people are just as quiet on the third floor and the seating is way more comfortable. \n\nIf you are going to have a shit week and you can sense it, prep in advance. Make a to do list. \n\nHold doors for people it\u2019s nice and once you do it a few times it hide people will start recognizing you. \n\nIf you ever really need friends, ask your seat mate for a pencil, compliment their pencil case, backpack, nails, most people are desperate enough for connection they will leap at the chance to make a new friend.",

            "comment": "Other hot tips for freshman. \nIf you're a commuter, the lockers in the sac are 20$ the first year and 10$ every year after. \n\nIf you are a first generation, low income, or student with learning disability, join trio. Its Levan 110 i believe. If you want to go to grad school they have a more advanced program for you that will help pay for the gre and other things. \n\nAlso another for first gen students. In your freshman year there will be flyers in the stu for something called the vincentian service scholarship. Its charity work in exchange for $6,000 yearly for 3 years. \n\nAnother program that isn't depaul related is American Needs You (ANY), its a scholarship/ professional development program for rising sophomores, remember to look into it.\n\nThere are also two food pantrys on campus, one in the loop and one in Lincoln park.",

Most of my classmates are career changers (teachers, realtors, accountants) or they took a chunk of time off for work or familial reasons. \n\nIf your partner is open to it, I *highly* recommend applying to the online program if they are not already.

For starters - they require 3 years of intermediate language. The reason this is an issue is many low income students received lower quality (or no) language experience in High School. This means for the most part they will have to start at 101 and those that went to \u201cbetter\u201d high schools will be able to start at 201. Leaving those with better high schools ahead.\n\n2) One of the reason RFMS is paired with DePaul is they are DESPERATE for students. They were put on probation (TWICE!) in the last 20 years which is not a good sign. If you look them up their acceptance rates are far far higher than any other medical school in the country, which also points to this.\n\n3) DePaul advertises the 3+ program like \u201cyeah you\u2019ll just get it\u201d when that\u2019s not the case. You\u2019d still have to interview and apply your sophomore year and from what I have heard about 50% of those people don\u2019t get into the 3+ program. So now you\u2019re sort of squandered with the regular 4+4 AND you\u2019ve given up the chance to go to a school with a better reputation.\n\n4) Even if you get into RFMS they aren\u2019t very included to give financial aid to those in the 3+ program so you\u2019re fucked financially.\n\n5) other universities with 3+ programs have phased them out because of \u201cdiversity issues\u201d (only rich white kids were in the programs) that isn\u2019t as palatable at DePaul, but it\u2019s definitely still the case. \n\n6) because of RFMS reputation, they have lower match rates than many of the other medical schools in the Chicago area. Meaning you may get all the way through medical school and then be fucked. \n\n6) it is my (and other professors I have spoken to) STRONG suggestion that you apply to other 3+ programs and go to almost ANY other 3+ program or go to another university that has a strong medical school (UIC is a GREAT option)",

Specifically the ones with less oversight (such as the lines: pink, brown, yellow, purple, red). A lot of those who are home insecure have been systematically discriminated against and have no other choice than to turn to crime. So in combination, the train cars have strong odors of people who have not had the chance to wash in a very long time and very high rates of crime. Again, this is not to blame them it is just a reality, and a generalization.",

            "comment": " \\-copying from another post-\n\nDePaul Honors Program here. If you are looking to be seriously challenged and graduate as a critical thinker who feels prepared to tackle societal challenges and injustices, the Honors Program is for you.\n\nHonors classes are capped at 20 students, so students get the opportunity to engage deeply and authentically with not only the class material but the professor and students. Honors classes are taught in a seminar style, making classes feel much more like an interactive community of learners sharing ideas and discussing issues and solutions, as opposed to more traditional classroom settings where students are often expected to learn passively. If grad school is in your future, the independent research opportunities we offer can help to enhance your applications.\n\nWe also offer exclusive co-curricular leadership opportunities, like having a peer mentor to help you transition to DePaul, chances to volunteer in the Chicago community, and career-oriented events to help prepare you for interviews and resume-building, just to name a few.\n\nUltimately, your decision to join the Honors Program depends on what you want to get out of your college experience. For students who are interested in a challenging, social-justice-based curriculum, planning on attending grad school, or simply looking to join a small community of serious-minded students within the larger campus of DePaul, Honors would be a good fit. Feel free to email [honorsprogram@depaul.edu](mailto:honorsprogram@depaul.edu) with questions.",

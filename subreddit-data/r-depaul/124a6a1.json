I think the campus life is pretty good, it's just not as intense as a non-city college. You'll need a fake if you are into bars. I had trouble finding parties my freshman year, but as an upperclassmen I have stuff to do every weekend. It depends on whether or not you make friends that like to party/go dancing/etc. (I'm CDM as well. Most of my friends were not made through my CDM classes. I made most of my connections on the Lincoln park campus through clubs and mutual friends.)",

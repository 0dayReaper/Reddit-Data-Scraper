    "postText": "Hello! Wondering if anyone has been in a similar position and could give me advice.\n\nI'm transferring into DePaul as a sophomore majoring in elementary education. There are 3 math courses required for my major. They're MAT-120 along with MAT-110 and MAT-111. Originally I was of the understanding that MAT-120 was a pre-req for MAT-110. Due to this, I was planning on taking 120 over the summer prior to taking 110 in the fall, since this is the only quarter the course is offered.\n\nHowever today after my meeting with my advisor she stated that due to my math placement test I didn't have to take 120 prior to 110, however I am still required to complete it at some point.\n\nHas anyone taken both of these classes? If so do you feel the information learned in 120 is essential to succeeding in 110 and 111?",

            "comment": "My advice might be out of date; they were changing the learning goals and outcomes for MAT 120 around the time I left DePaul. \n\nI used to advise students that MAT 120 was kind of like data science, meets Stats, meets Excel. It\u2019s a requirement for most students that don\u2019t have Calc or advanced math in their major (like stats specific to a social science). \n\nNot as familiar with the teaching elementary math classes. If your advisor said not to worry about it, I\u2019d guess there\u2019s not too much intersection between them and MAT 120. \n\n\u2026Oh, and since you mentioned being a transfer student, did you take any math at your previous school?  Might be worth it to ask if any previous math work can substitute for 120.",

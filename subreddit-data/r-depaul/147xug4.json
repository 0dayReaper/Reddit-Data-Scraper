    "postText": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI am a rising senior at DePaul looking to inquire about potential community college credits. Up until this point, I have only taken classes at DePaul. This previous quarter I took three classes instead of four (dropped one to manage work). I am now slated to take 5 classes the first quarter of senior year and 4 in the winter and spring respectively. I am contemplating taking some summer courses at a CC to lighten up my course load. I am aware of the residency concept in play, though I have read on threads that it can be circumvented. Would appreciate anyone\u2019s insight on this.\n\nBest,\nFellow Blue Demon",

You can take a class there to light your load. Since we pay for 18 credits a quarter, you'll only need to add two more credits in cost to even out. The December intercession is tied to the aid of the winter quarter.",

What kind of things can students be involved in?\n\nIs it easy to make friends just by going to class? I know the class sizes are small so does that help in any way?",

So definitely attend the club fair! You can check the clubs on DeHub. Find a club or two and you should make friends. \n\nAs for other activities, I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s much events on campus. Or well, good at least. Mostly because it is a commuter school so no one attends. Plus, everyone wants to explore the diversity chicago offers. The city is supposed to \u201cbe your campus.\u201d Which can be a good thing.",

The on campus experience is below average in my eyes but the city is indeed your playground so that makes up for the lack of campus presence. \n\nMaking friends can be hit or miss here as so many kids are commuters or don't live close to campus. Class sizes are indeed smaller than usual but you end up seeing a ton of the same people class to class (based on major likely etc)",

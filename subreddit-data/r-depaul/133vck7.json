I'm from the south side, with African, Native American, and Mexican ancestry.  From my experience individuals who don't vibe with you because of what you look like, or what color of skin you have, your background and name, ignore them and move on.\n\nHowever, DePaul is a diverse institution and there are tons of events and groups you can sign up for.\n\nJust be yourself and have a good time.",

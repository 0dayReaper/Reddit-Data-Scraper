    "postText": "\nHi Everyone,\n\nI have been working for some time now on this website [ratemycourses.io](https://ratemycourses.io/depaul) and I am really excited to share it with you.\n\nYou can use this to look at reviews and get advice on courses you're interested in. You can also sort courses by difficulty, usefulness and the overall rating from reviews made by other students. I think if enough people start using it regularly. it's going to be essential when you're choosing your electives or just to get advice on courses you will be taking.\n\nLastly, filtering and sorting courses is only gonna be useful and accurate if there are a lot of reviews, so please go ahead and leave some reviews to courses you've taken or are currently taking. \n\nAlso, please dm me if you have an idea on how I can let more students know about this. And if anyone is interested in writing an article about this dm me!\n\nEnjoy!!",

What if a course has a lot of quizes, but they only account for 20% of the grade. Is that \"quiz heavy\"? \n\nBut, other than that - the UI was fantastic. Great project! If you had a github I feel like the sauce would be pretty interesting",

One thing I would suggest is making the names of classes match what they are on campus connect, a lot of the film school classes are being changed, like editing 2 is now POST200. \n\nBut I think this is super useful and I\u2019ll do my part in trying to spread it around to students I know!",

            "comment": "ONE SUGGESTION: when you write a review, the division of the written section as 'comments on the course', 'course content', 'comments on the professor', and 'advice' is redundant. Those thoughts can be more easily covered in one statement. You can add those prompts as suggestions for one written statement instead of separating them. Makes it confusing how to properly categorize your thoughts like that.",

    "postText": "Hello! I'm currently a freshman in high school and I live around an hour away. I've heard of other people having success emailing professors for research opportunities over the summer. \r\n\r\nIt's pretty early but I think it would be great for me to experience it as I'm considering a career in STEM! I've always been a tech guy so I think CS/Engineering is a possibility for me (I was able to get a good science recommendation and will be taking Intro to CS over summer and AP CSA early next year). I have little experience but I'm beginning to learn on my own and willing to put in the effort! \r\n\r\nAlso, I find STEM in general interesting so any research opportunity would be great for me to explore. How should I go about emailing these professors? (Also, is this the right month to email them or am I doing this too late?)\r\n\r\nThanks!",

I want to be competitive, I think it\u2019s a great way to gain experience instead of wasting my summer at home. I want to take advantage of 2 months of free time and there\u2019s nothing I can lose from it, if anything, I will meet new people and figure out what I want to do in my life.",

There's just a lot of factors you learn from college that come from getting you into your own career and its very convoluted. It's good to start early, don't get me wrong, but it's also nice taking advantage of the time you have to relax and be a kid still. \n\nEven though you're in high school, there's a lot you take for granted. For me, I didn't realize how important free time is. I work 2-3 jobs on top of doing school full-time, and I don't get many breaks. You may not realize it now, but those summer breaks you have now will eventually become filled up with stuff throughout the next 4-5 years. \n\nI completely get where you're coming from with getting experience since school doesn't really teach you anything tbh. Most professors rarely take in students that they know, so it will definitely be difficult to cold call any of them, especially at DePaul where there are like 20k students. \n\nI hope what I'm saying doesn't discourage what you want to do, it's just a bit of advice from my own experience. Feel free to DM me anytime regarding all of this, it definitely can be daunting and tiresome to deal with",

I\u2019m probably going to start emailing professors this weekend after doing some research or planning, I\u2019ll let you know if I have any questions. Thanks!",

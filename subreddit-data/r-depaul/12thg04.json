    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI need to order my cap &amp; gown like...yesterday but I have been toiling over what size to order.\n\nI am F, 5'6, and around 192 lbs. The sizing has &lt;200 and 201-250 as options for sizing. I am nervous to order the &lt;200 because I don't want the gown to be too tight, but I also dont want to be swimming in it if I order the other size. Does anyone have any advice or previous experience with Herff Jones fits that could help make this decision?\n\nThanks in advance :)",

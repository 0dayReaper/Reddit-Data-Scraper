Don\u2019t overly stand out especially at night, so walk in groups stay in well lit areas and you\u2019ll be fine. If you\u2019re still paranoid I\u2019d recommended getting pepper spray. I\u2019m a dude but even I carry pepper spray because I have night classes.",

            "comment": "As a CURRENT Junior student at Depaul who firsthand heard the Depaul student attacked screaming for help in the Depaul parking lot beside Fullerton TODAY. It really is getting more frightening even if Lincoln park is in the north. There is no one in front of buildings acting as security or anyone checking ID\u2019s of who is going in and out of the campus. Students can be easily stolen from or attacked inside the school such as what happened today. A student was LITERALLY attacked inside the SAC BATHROOM. It\u2019s safe till its not. It\u2019s safe till you\u2019re the unlucky person who happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. Campus security go around the school, but are almost always absent in times where actual crime is happening. That student should not have been screaming for help for as long as she did in that dark parking lot alone. Security should have been there quicker. For a school that costs so much, you would think they keep their students safety the top priority, but they don\u2019t. Chicago will always have sketchy areas and sketchy people. But Depaul should surely invest in more security for the students.",

                    "comment": "I agree about the ID part. I am not a student this quarter, I am coming back in the fall. But when I had classes downtown and I took the shuttle back to Lincoln Park, all the driver did was check to see if I had an ID. The first couple times they got me thinking, how do they check the validity of the idea? There\u2019s no expiration date on it from what I\u2019m aware of. And honestly anyone can present an ID and come on the shuttle even if they are not a student currently. Thinking about that made me feel uneasy.\n\nAdditionally, I have just walked into buildings.  I was currently attending and I was wearing a backpack and looked like a student, but none of the security guards checked. I am a black male, so maybe that has something to do with it, and not wanting me to feel persecuted. But I did also see it not happening to other people who weren\u2019t of my skin complexion. So with all that being said, I do you feel that there are some security risks, at least when it comes to who can access areas of the campus.\n\nI asked for your concern on feeling safe to the OP. I do feel like there are bad parts in every city, just like there are good parts. The northside is relatively safe, but I do have the Citizen app, and it alerts me of things that are going on in the area. The app also has a feature if you want to pay for it, where you basically have a real life person, that knows your location, and can stay with you until you get to your destinations safely, as well as an abundance of other features. It can be used for traveling in an unfamiliar location, it can be used when meeting someone new for the first time, it can be used if you have experience anxiety with an Ubers, but I think it\u2019s a really neat thing to have. The Citizen app is free and alerts you of things and you\u2019re nearby in the media area. But the premium feature, which I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much money, it\u2019s basically like you\u2019re on bodyguard in your pocket.\n\nI will end this by saying, even though I do feel the north side is relatively safe, don\u2019t ignore your intuition, don\u2019t ignore your sensitivity. It\u2019s designed to keep you safe. And honestly, I\u2019d rather have you be paranoid, than to be hurt emotionally or even physically. And I know you won\u2019t let your judgment keep you from living. But always put you first. Even as a tall, black guy, I have a stun, gun, and a military grade whistle. Because despite my physical, I\u2019m very gentle and non-confrontational. And unfortunately not everyone is like that.\n\nBut I hope you end up coming to the school and because it\u2019s really beautiful and fun.  Catch you later fellow blue demon. \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70",

This is not common! \n\nBecause this is chicago, I always recommend pepper spray and a pocket knife. Very common students carry them, but its more of a comfort for us, then the intent to ever have to use them. \n\nFor the most part Lincoln park is a very nice area. Yes, like any city, things will happen. This isn't normal, but it happens. \n\nAs for the loop, the loop is a bit more wild. In order to mediate this concern for students the school has a shuttle bus open to students from each campus. I will remind you, the vast majority of your classmates will be riding the train with you to and from campus. So you're not alone. Even if you took an evening class many of your classmates arrive and leave together. \n\nI really wouldn't worry to much. Just be watchful, careful, and calm. I say this as another women. \ud83d\ude01",

As far as I know, the ones downtown make up most of the notifications from the past few years, with only recently has there been really any notable emails from Lincoln Park. I assume it has to be a change in rate because of the time of year (more people are out in the warm weather, so there's more chances for problems).\n\nThat being said I still feel totally safe on campus because I'm always only going for classes and traveling in the groups of other students. Just be aware of your surroundings when traveling or have some friends in a class to travel with and you'll be okay. The reports of incidents seem to primarily be for people who were alone and randomly had problems, not anything to do with DePaul explicitly.",

            "comment": "alright, if you can lock in, not sure if you can. you would log into campus connect clock manage classes, search and enroll, autumn 2023-2024, and then you can search classes. \n\nYou need your discover or explore chicago, so im presuming you have that selected. Start with your WRD requirement. I wouldn't recommend doing your LSP 112 or experimental learning as you can do study abroad or other fun things with these opportunities. There is even a study abroad to Poland for the multi cultralism one. So just consider these things. \n\nNext if you know your major I would recommend starting with your 101 if available. If you are any of the sciences I would consider looking into any of the sequence courses for bio or chem or any math courses you might need.\n\nAs for the last one. Consider something that fills your history, arts and literature, or religious requirements. Normally they aren't to difficult, but peak through and find something of interest.\n\nYou are also eligible for a 2 credit course. I dont recommend it for your first quarter. Dip your feel in the water before you dive in. But I want you to be aware that we pay for 18 credits,most only use their 16. \n\nif you have any other questions or want to share your major let me know. Also do you know how to look at your degree progress report (dpr)\n\nrecommendations:\ndiscover/explore (4 credits)\nWrd 103 or 104 (4 credits)\n101 course (4 credits)\nArts, History, or rel (4 credits)",

The course advice you are getting on this thread is good. My big caveat would be if you have AP, IB, CLEP, or community college credit you\u2019ll want to vet you class choices with an advisor to make sure you don\u2019t repeat any credit you have already earned. \n\nOne last thing\u2014they used to do this stupid staggered enrollment thing, where rosters for the required freshmen classes capped at 5 students until all sections filled. Then the next 5 seats in all sections would open. And so on. If DePaul still does this, classes that look closed this week might actually have plenty of seats by your orientation date.",

I am hispanic/latino and come from an low-average income household. I have a 3.4 GPA and a 1120 SAT score.\n\n1. Which school is better for job placement in the CS field?\n2. Which would look more impressive when looking for jobs after undergrad?\n3. Which has a more solid CS program?\n4. Which would be cheaper after aid?\n5. Which has the best location in the city?",

            "comment": "Can\u2019t speak much of IIT, but UIC is going to be cheaper than DePaul and Loyola since it\u2019s a state college opposed to the other two being private. I\u2019m currently a graduate student in the cybersecurity program at DePaul. The program at times feels lack luster and it\u2019s a quarter based system instead of semesters, so the material comes and goes quickly for each class. DePaul definitely has a great campus at either the Loop (downtown Chicago) or a bit outside of that in Lincoln Park.",

            "comment": "1. Each school has a jobs search program that helps you find jobs in your chosen field. That said, I ended up finding my job through a friend of mine rather than through DePaul. \"Job Placement\" in CS is most easily found through the network you build at school - not the school itself.\n\n2. There's a myth about schools looking impressive on resumes. In the real world almost no one gives a damn what school you come from. The only cases that your school matters is when your recruiter or interviewers come from the same school, and even then it really only matters what you're like when you show up to interview. I know students who got jobs at Google, Microsoft, and boutique consulting firms at DePaul. Networking, personality, and skills are 100% more important than school choice. That said as an interviewer, I would rate IIT the lowest of the four schools you mentioned though it wouldn't rule you out from an interview with me.\n\n3. No one can really answer this because I know no one who's gone through all four programs at all four schools. I *will* say that DePaul will fill your curriculum with both CS and General Ed classes and to some that feels like a waste of time. As a CS graduate from DePaul let me tell you that the non-CS classes had a profound impact on my life and my education. I took courses in ethics, philosophy, public speaking, and built not only strong friendships in these classes but also took away important life lessons and relationships with my teachers. DePaul specifically is on the Quarter system which means you take three quarters of 4 classes that last 10 weeks. To some this feels wasteful because the first week of classes is often thrown away for administrative tasks and reading curriculums. Where as at UIC you take two Semesters at 16 weeks long. This means there's less \"bullshit\" at UIC - most of your classes are related directly to your major. IMO, that's a negative thing. At DePaul I was given amazing flexibility to pursue 3D modeling, Game Design, Management Information Systems, and other disciplines. And that flexibility also allowed me and my peers some incredible study abroad opportunities that you won't find anywhere else. If you are dead set on **COMPUTER SCIENCE** as your degree, and you don't care for anything else outside of that then I'd say UIC is still in the running for you. But if you want the flexibility and curiosity of other coursework alongside your CS degree, I highly recommend DePaul.\n\n4. DePaul for me ended up cheaper than UIC. I came out with $35,000 in outstanding loans. That said I had academic and need-based scholarships from DePaul and I worked on campus for two years. Working on campus was also another huge boost to my resume, but so too was getting an internship at a Fortune 50 company in my senior year that played a big part at landing my first \"real\" job. For context, I was offered a full-time job out of my internship with pay and benefits exceeding $80,000.\n\n5. Definitely DePaul hands down. Its Lincoln Park campus is at the heart of residential Chicago. You have great restaurants, bars, parks, and you're truly in the middle of everything with the red and brown lines that can bring you north or south, and the bus system that can bring you to the zoo or beach to the east and other neighborhoods to the west. Its downtown campus is also in the middle of downtown and well-placed to let you explore literally everywhere in the loop - the Harold Washington Library is blocks away, and there are busses to bring you to Hyde Park, the various museum campuses, etc.\n**Loyola** is very far north in Chicago. Uptown is the last stop before you get to the suburbs of the city, and trips into the loop are twice as long as they are from Lincoln Park.\n**UIC** I always thought of being a bit of an island in the middle of nowhere. You stay on campus or take train out, that's it. The immediate area surrounding UIC is pretty blue collar, industrial. Not bad, but not nearly as nice as the two DePaul campuses. That islandness though makes UIC feel like a University town rather than DePaul that can at times feel a bit like a city college - where students come in to go to classes and leave immediately after to go home.",

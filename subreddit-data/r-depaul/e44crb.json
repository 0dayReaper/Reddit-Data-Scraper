Keep up the good work coach.\n\nFor all the current students - I went to as many games as possible during my four years (at Allstate) and it was a blast. Wintrust is way better and so is this team.

I know it sounds crazy to compare the two, but you could feel that the students, alum and this city want this team to win. It's been so long since we have had a team we can get behind. This city loved Loyola's run, but I can tell this team can eclipse that if they put their best effort forward. We want this, we need this, and I hope DePaul reclaims its rightful place as Chicago's college team.\n\nIf any of our current roster reads this, please know we want nothing but the best for you. If you ball out like you did tonight the rest of the season we will never forget you! It's not easy becoming a legend, but this roster has the chance to do just that. We still talk about Ray Meyer and he hasn't coached since 1984. We still talk about the 85 Bears and haven't won a Super Bowl since. We Are DePaul and if you Play Possessed you will live on FOREVER!",

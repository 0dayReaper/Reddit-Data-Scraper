Also, the only other reason they would come in is if you were violating quiet hours or hotboxing the dorm room.\n\nWorked for me - I\u2019ve hidden worse than a frog, but then again, that was almost six years ago.",

There's not much room in the dorms and it's 50/50 that your roommate will be okay with it. The only animals allowed in the dorms are fish and they're still pretty strict about that. I would hope that you would give your pet a large enough enclosure and I don't believe DePaul's limits are suitable for such an animal (I could be wrong idk). Just know that you are facing consequences not only for yourself but for your roommate and your pet as well if you get caught. Totally up to you though, just my opinion.",

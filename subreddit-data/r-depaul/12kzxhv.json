    "postText": "I\u2019m majoring in Health Science at DePaul University and I am looking to go through the pre physician assistant track. But I was also wondering if I could get a well paying job with just a BS in health science after college? Also what would be a good minor to have with it? I sort of like Informations technology or informations systems and also user experience design. \n\nI\u2019d like to have a smooth college experience without so much academic stress? What is your guys opinion? Just want to be well off after college and not go through anymore schooling honestly.",

            "comment": "A health science degree is one of those degrees where post undergraduate schooling is like the norm if you want a \u201chigh paying\u201d job. It\u2019s not a standalone degree like business or computer science, it\u2019s such an overarching degree that you\u2019re going to have to have a sub speciality. Like becoming a physician, or a pharmacist, or a phlebotomist. Other than that a heal science degree alone will likely land you social working positions related to health. Like health counseling, dietician etc. Is it impossible to get a job with just a health science degree? Absolutely not, but if you\u2019re looking for a 100k+ salary you\u2019re definitely jn for some more schooling.",

            "comment": "Hi! \nSo I have a UXD minor and am highly debating a IT minor too depending on the amount of space I have. Personally, I have no idea how they translate or if they're simply passion or skill building projects, but I can definitely tell you more about them. \n\nThe UXD classes are nice. There are two intro ones that you have to take UXD 101 (there is an async offer this fall, which is what I plan to do) and UXD 210. I took UXD 210 async, it was easy and fun. You got to design and create some images for apps that you would protype. UXD 210 also fits into the IT minor. There are three classes that can be cross listed between them. UXD 210, IT 130 (its the intro course) IT 231 (web design 1, the only pre req is 130.) There is a possibility of you getting an exception for UXD. UXD takes IT 223 which is Data analysis. Its likely as CSH student you took stats, which they might be willing to approve for this placement. No guarantee but I would recommend asking as long as you have taken stats. \nSo it would look like this if you wanted both.\n\nUXD Minor (6 classes)\nUXD 101\nUXD 210 (double list)\nIT 130 (double list)\nIT 231 (double list) \nStats (if you get the cross list approval) or\nUXD (any of the list)\nUXD (Any of the list)\nIT MINOR (3 not counting double list.) \nIT 130 (double list)\nIT 240 (no pre req btw)\nIT 231 (double list) \nIT 211 \nUXD 210 (Double list) \nIT (one from the list)\n\nYou could have both in 9 classes or 6 for each. The only thing I'd raise caution to is a lot of UXD classes run in 3 hour sections. So I think 101 is running 1:30-4:45 M or W. Three hour classes in the middle of the day is something I hate and don't recommend. Which is why I mentioned the async option in fall as it wasn't offered async this quarter. \n\nAnyway. If you have any questions let me know.",

Unfortunately, the school I may go to doesn't offer UX design as a major or minor so I would have to go to a different school if I want to do that.",

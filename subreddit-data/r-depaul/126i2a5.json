    "postText": "I know that there is a new shuttle that takes us directly to and from Lincoln Park and Cinespace this quarter. I took it after my class Tuesday but I forgot where the shuttle parks on the Lincoln Park campus, and I don\u2019t know when it departs today (Thursday). I have another Cinespace class today so if anyone knows and can tell me so I can avoid taking the train and getting on the Loop shuttle that would be great. The Lincoln Park shuttle is just much more convenient and preferable for me.",

I have nothing to go off of other than knowing it was someplace near the Stu because I remember walking a bit and the Stu being there. I can\u2019t find anything about the shuttle online or in emails either, probably because it\u2019s a new thing and from what I heard only a 10 week test trial. That\u2019s why I was asking, in case anyone else knew more because I\u2019m completely clueless and at a loss here. \ud83d\ude05\n\nEh, if I still can\u2019t figure out the location and departure times before I have to leave I\u2019ll just take the train and Loop shuttle then, and the Lincoln Park shuttle back, like I did Tuesday. Guess it isn\u2019t that big of a deal at the end of the day as long as I have a way of getting there.",

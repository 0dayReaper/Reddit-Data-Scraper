    "postText": "With the looming budget fiasco do you think DePaul would have to close in a few years? I\u2019ve never heard of any schools having such a large gap. I\u2019m not sure what to expect honestly. I\u2019m wondering how they would make up the gap other than increasing admissions. \n\nI was admitted into their CDM program with an offer from UT Austin for a similar program. I prefer DePaul but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worth all of they money especially after hearing about budget cuts.",

            "comment": "Good question, but not a chance of happening.   You hear of much smaller schools closing but DePaul, I think, has grown an endowment to a sizable amount and could always fall back on that.  Also, I don't know if all universities are as open about what's going on budget wise right now for most universities around the country.  Northwestern has (quietly) had layoffs the past year or so and might have more.  I have a friend that's a grad assistant there, and while NW has a huge endowment, they still are cutting some budget.",

If I\u2019m not mistaken I believe CDM is the biggest college with the most enrollment. Even then DePaul is no way near closing, that\u2019s like not even a thought in anyone\u2019s mind type of thing.",

There are many schools closing:\n\n[https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/education/college/2023/04/10/iowa-wesleyan-university-students-share-anxiety-college-closes/70081003007/](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/education/college/2023/04/10/iowa-wesleyan-university-students-share-anxiety-college-closes/70081003007/)\n\n[https://www.fox6now.com/news/cardinal-stritch-university-closing-president](https://www.fox6now.com/news/cardinal-stritch-university-closing-president)\n\nAlso,  include Presentation College in Aberdeen, South Dakota;\u00a0Cazenovia College in Cazenovia, New York; Holy Names University in Oakland, California;\u00a0and Living Arts College in Raleigh, North Carolina just this year.  It is a long list.\n\nBut DePaul, and other large schools, have significant runway against their endowment, and significant alumni bases to work from.  DePaul's endownment is over $800M per Wikipedia.  The University can lose money for some time yet.  Before they deplete an endowment, they'll cut costs - and eventually, enough other schools will close to solve the \"too few\" student problem.",

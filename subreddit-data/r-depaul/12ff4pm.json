            "comment": "Regular honors limits the amount of classes you can take because they have to be honors. It also feels more like a cohort than anything else. There are also dorm areas you can choose to live in with other honors students. Personally I dont recommend it because you're basically signing up for harder classes with the reward of tassels at the end of your degree. \n\nStrobel on the other hand, if you really plan to stick with finance its a decent program. \n\nAlso, these are just my opinions but I want to make this clear. You could literally take honors for your freshman year and if you don't like it, drop it. Its not a requirement for you to stick with it.",

            "comment": "DePaul Honors Program here. It is totally possible to do the Honors Program and the Strobel Program together. Many Strobel scholars are also in the Honors Program.\n\nWhether the Honors Program is 'worth it' depends entirely on what you are hoping to get out of your education. If you are only pursuing an Honors education for the title and tassel at the end, then our opinion is that that is not a good enough motivation to join the Program. You won't really get anything out of it if that's why you're joining. Students truly benefit from the program when their reason for joining Honors is to get a critical, deeply-engaging, socially-justice-oriented curriculum to fulfill their general education requirements that replicates the experience of a small, liberal arts college. Honors classes are not harder, they are different. In Honors, you get to be part of a close-knit, highly supported group of high-achieving students and small, seminar-style classes that make your liberal arts general education a deeper, more critical experience. Feel free to email [honorsprogram@depaul.edu](mailto:honorsprogram@depaul.edu) if you have more questions.",

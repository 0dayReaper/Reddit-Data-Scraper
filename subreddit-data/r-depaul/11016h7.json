    "postText": "Recently got admitted and was wondering how many classes you take per term and how you like the program. \n\nI know terms are different and it seems as if there\u2019s 3 terms (10week/ term) compared to two semesters (16week/semester). Undergrad I usually took 5 classes a semester at least 15 hours/ semester usually while maintaining a 20-30/week job. And maintained pretty good grades with little to no stress. \n\nI\u2019m thinking about 2 or 3 classes and either a part time or full time job since most classes seem to be after 5 and online. I\u2019d want to graduate in 2 years but the program seems to require a lot of introductory and foundational courses before you get into the actual program that really would take 2.5 or 3 years.",

There is also a shorter summer quarter and I would normally take a single class during that quarter.\n\nI think the addition of a 3rd class would really depend on how flexible your part-time job is. They normally recommend no more than 2 classes a quarter. Each class is about 3ish hours a week and then you probably have another 8 to 12 hours of reading or project work for each class each week. Most classes have some sort of group project component to them, so you can just imagine the legwork required to coordinate with 3 different groups.",

Overall the pros far outweigh the cons and at the end of the day this degree helped me transition over into Product Design so it was very much worth it.\n\nDePaul's program will give you value equal to what you put in. They don't go out of their way to challenge you, so it is easy to skate by with no real effort and graduate. The majority of people in the program are not like that though and after a class or two you will find a solid crew of people to work with on projects that will challenge you and help you build an excellent portfolio.\n\nOne knock on the program is that it is a bit dated and it is more geared towards UX Research than design. You can get around this pretty easily by learning Figma and using that whenever you can and to also take some of the MA in Experience Design classes to fill up your electives. While it doesn't hurt to know some of the history of the industry, some of the classes are laughably out of date. You just have to deal with it, but I do know towards the end of my time there they were looking to overhaul some classes.\n\nBut in the end, I met some great people to network with, got some great projects to put in a portfolio and was instantly connected to the very deep Chicago UX industry. If you are committed to the program you can do the same!",

The program is pretty expensive but most people seem to be able to get a job if they stayed in the chicago area just due to connections and the name of the school. \n\nI\u2019m also interested more in UX research than design. I\u2019m interested in learning design just to be comprehensive when it comes to UX but I\u2019m more interested in the research side.",

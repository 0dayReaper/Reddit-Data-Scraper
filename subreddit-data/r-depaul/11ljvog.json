    "postText": "My daughter was accepted to DePaul as a Freshman for the Fall 2023.  She is considering another urban school farther away partly because we toured the campuses on a rainy day and saw some sketchy people on the midday L rides between the campuses.\n\nShe likes the vibe of the Lincoln Park campus/area.  As a business major, it sounds like she would have a lot of classes in the Loop.\n\nThe L seems very convenient to both campuses.\n\n* Any recommendations to sway her that the L would be safe and sound during a weekday 'commute'?\n* Are classes difficult to schedule between campuses?\n* I would think living downtown would be less than ideal because there wouldn't be as much to do downtown on the weekends. Am I wrong on that?\n\nThank you!",

Like if she doesn't want to take the train with her classmates (right before class periods its full of students), she can ride in one of our depaul busses that leaves from the student center and drops off at 1 e Jackson. Runs like every 30-45 minutes from like 10am-10pm",

Definitely live in Lincoln park at least for the first couple years. \n\nI would give at least close to an hour between classes if she had to commute. You could do it in 30 minutes if get lucky with train timing, but with an hour she\u2019ll have time to do the walks and not have to rush. \n\nI took night time classes downtown and I was fine riding the redline at night as a guy, but the redline is quite empty at night. I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s very dangerous, but you\u2019ll definitely see at least a couple sketchy people when you ride during that time.",

            "comment": "Chiming into add that when taking night classes, the red line would be crowded with other DePaul students. Typically classes would walk down together or in large groups. I never had a problem after a night class with safety.\n\nI generally stuck to the brown line if I could. Riding in the first car outside of rush hour is something I still do and did as a student as well. \n\nAs a young woman I've had my share of sketchy situations living in the city, it's important to just trust your gut and stay aware of your surroundings. If someone feels \"off\" move to another train car, etc.",

            "comment": "I just want to add that it\u2019s not as scary as it seems. I moved from a small town and the train was scary at first but honestly, it\u2019s nothing now. There\u2019s always sketch people but just leave them alone. People might come down asking for money but she should just politely say she doesn\u2019t have any or not say anything at all. There\u2019s also an inter campus shuttle for DePaul that takes students between the campuses. The train is easy too. She\u2019s likely going to inevitably use the red line if her major is centered in the Loop. Red line smells and there\u2019s a lot of people but you just gotta get through it. If she can, she should use the purple line as much as she can. Also, she should try to have a buddy to travel with until she gets more comfortable. Going between campuses on the train, she\u2019s mainly going to be riding with other college students.",

Like the others mentioned there always will be sketchy people, even on the blue line. I took the red and brown lines to get between campuses but the red line is definitely the most sus, feels like there's a stabbing on there every week. Just keep your head down and don't make eye contact but always be aware of your surroundings, I always had my music off when I rode the red line.",

Taking the L really isn't that bad and you become more comfortable with it the more you do it.  I really liked living downtown because of how close it is to the lake (10 minute walk) and L stops so you can go really anywhere you want to. It's definitely not the typical college experience but still very enjoyable!",

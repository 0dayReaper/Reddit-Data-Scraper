Back then, there was a lot of smoke around Cleveland Melvin and his abrupt dismissal -- it was rumored that he sexually assaulted someone -- but we couldn't prove any of it. There's a reason why the Title IX position at DePaul is under constant turnover. If this doesn't get JLP fired, I truly don't know what will. She deserved it for the atrocious men's basketball record. She deserved it after her insider Wintrust connection was revealed. She deserved it after DePaul received NCAA sanctions due to a head coach she hired. She deserved it after inexplicably resigning that coach to a new contract. But she deserves it for this, most of all.",

But, it hasn't happened yet, so I'm not inclined to believe it will happen any time soon.  At this point, it's a knock against the new President.  I can see waiting a year before shaking things up, but it's been too long.",

This is definitely on Esteban in part, but Conviser's initial complaints happened under Holtschneider. It's clear from the case file (if you believe the plantiff) that JLP's stranglehold on DePaul athletics goes beyond the powers of the university president, as she was the one in charge of Title IX appointees and is thus responsible for how they did or did not respond to Conviser. At this point, it's fair to question what sort of dirt JLP has on the board of trustees to last this long... But even if that stuff were to come out, I bet a lot of people would handwave it away as the \"Chicago Way\" like they did when the Wintrust stuff came out.",

Here's what I wrote in reply:\n\nI don't want to relitigate the Wintrust stuff (actually, maybe I do) but it still doesn't pass the smell test to me. Let's throw out the anonymous source entirely. You still have a rep from Wintrust saying that Kandace Lenti was responsible for \"introductions between DePaul and Wintrust leadership and attended most of the meetings we had.\u201d She's also listed as the point of contact for Wintrust on some of the official documents. She may not have led the meetings per se, but she was certainly involved, and Wintrust's Doubleday says Lenti \"counts DePaul as one of her customers.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the vague statement from DePaul's Carol Hughes in that article implies that JLP was hardly involved in the negotiations. But on her bio on the DePaul website, it says \"she was also instrumental in the negotiations for Wintrust Arena \u2013 the new home for DePaul basketball \u2013 which opened in November 2017.\" (src: \nhttps://depaulbluedemons.com/staff-directory/jean-lenti-ponsetto/5). Jeff Bethke's bio -- the guy who DePaul says actually ran the naming rights deal -- has no mention of his role in the deal on his page.\n\nDePaul is trying to have it both ways, saying JLP wasn't involved enough to have to fill a conflict of interest form -- despite having her sister-in-law in attendance for apparently most of the negotiations -- and yet also giving her the credit for getting the deal done. This has never squared with me.\n\nAnyway, regardless on how you come down on the Wintrust stuff, I think it's emblematic of how incestuous the athletic department is.",

I didn't even know what they were talking about so obviously i stayed quiet. There have been rumors related to something sexual with this situation on top of it. \n\nI hope more comes out. The players deserve justice as well as Conviser. This is pathetic and I'm very interested to see how this unfolds. This better be the straw to get JLP outta here but the coverup could be a teamwide effort even in the president's office, who knows",

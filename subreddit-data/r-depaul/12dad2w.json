    "postText": "So I got admitted to the masters program for CS meant for non majors (they have introductory courses before the core courses). The program curriculum looks solid but I noticed there\u2019s no math pre-req for any of these classes? I come from an undergrad in psych which means there\u2019s not a single spec of math in my field. Wouldn\u2019t you need math to understand or get by in the program? Would it hinder me from passing my CS classes if I haven\u2019t done math in a couple years?",

    "postText": "How is DePaul perceived by Chicago employers? \n\nDePaul\u2019s ranking isn\u2019t the highest, and for an international student who would be spending significantly more money than her peers to attend, the brand name and its relation to employment prospects is extremely important to me. This is both for jobs after graduation as well as internships during study.\n\nThere\u2019s only so far a high GPA can take you - is the school looked down upon in any way, are other unis in Illinois given priority, or is it more reputable than statistics say?",

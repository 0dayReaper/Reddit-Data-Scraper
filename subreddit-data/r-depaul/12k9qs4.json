Approximately how long did it take to get your financial aid offer?\nDid your financial aid offer change a lot from the estimated amount that was initially sent out?\n\n(This has been stressing me out for a bit now as I did kind of wait awhile to complete the verification and I just hope I get it before may 1!)\n\nThanks in advance!!",

    "postText": "The title says it all mostly. My time in the CS program (I take DS classes predominantly in terms of electives) has been prolonged because when I first started the program I didn\u2019t have a demanding job. And last year I got a highly demanding job. I\u2019m exhausted 24/7 basically doing 50-60 hours a week at work and then school.\n\nI\u2019ve got some classes lined up through the summer but I\u2019ll have 3 left to go beginning in the Fall. I really want to take 1 in Fall, 1 in Winter, 1 in Spring to just wrap this up. I\u2019ve learned a lot and like the program, but as I\u2019ve gone, really good professors in terms of electives have been harder to come by. CS is never really \u201ceasy\u201d but looking to find something manageable. Where I won\u2019t have a huge load and it won\u2019t be overwhelming. So I\u2019m wondering if anyone has any suggestions\n\nI\u2019m honestly just extremely tired and I\u2019ve battled some illness that prolonged a few things as well. I just need to find some light at the end of the tunnel so the final classes aren\u2019t excruciating",

    "postText": "Hi I am a possible transfer student for Fall in the American Studies program! I have to make my decision in in literally 4 hours, but I have some questions! Are the distribution requirements unbearable? What kind of arts are on campus, is there a good music scene? I feel like all I hear about is how hard it is to make friends at DePaul, is this true?",

            "comment": "Idk about the requirements. For the art scene on campus, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve tried finding clubs for art but they rarely meet. However, one club does host events and stuff where you can make and sell art. There is the IRL lab where you can do screen printing, sewing, and 3D printing. You can also rent our cameras I think in the art department. There\u2019s a dark room for analog cameras, but I think you can only use it if you\u2019re in the analog photography class. \n\nYes making friends at DePaul can be hard. It\u2019s full of commuters who do not stay on campus, so the social scene can be dead. I have friends on campus who seem to have trouble as well. My best advice is just to talk to people and try your best. Especially during orientation. Say yes to hanging out! \n\nIt\u2019s also dead because people would rather explore the city and Chicago overall. The music scene is good, there\u2019s events and such to watch bands perform at house shows and venues. There\u2019s even races happening rn",

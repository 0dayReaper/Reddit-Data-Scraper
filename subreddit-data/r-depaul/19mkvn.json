    "postText": "Men's basketball is beyond pathetic. Losing to USF. Zero improvement over the past few years. They give Oliver Purnell over a million dollars a year to win less than 3 Big East games a year. What a joke.\n\nNo recruiting. The only recuit we have coming in is Garret Jr who is only here because his dad is on the coaching staff.\n\nBut the issues extend far beyond men's basketball. \n\nZero outreach to the DePaul community. Blue Crew (who has done a great job this year) has 2 people tabling at the student center. What else have we seen? We have people who get paid for this type of thing and we have seen zero change in athletic culture at DePaul. I have heard of season ticket holders walking away from the program, emailing the marketing department to let them know...and the department just lets them go. No fight to keep them. \n\nWe have a gold medal coach in Bruno and the women's team can't even make the tournament. What does that say about the department? The man is capable of top 5 finishes in the Big East every year and we don't allow him to. \n\nOh, and the women's softball coach shares the AD's last name. Nepotism at its finest. Fire Jean Lenti Ponsetto.",

            "comment": "Former DePaul Athlete here.  You are absolutely hitting the nail on the head.  Getting rid of the Lenti's are the only way to turn DePaul Athletics around at all.  \n\nA couple of things- Doug Bruno was originally fired for going to the AD back in the early 80's and denouncing Ray Meyer as being too old to continue to be the DePaul Head Coach.  He, along with Gene Sullivan headed North to Loyola.  In the mid 90's Jeannie lead a campaign to get rid of Joey Meyer and to bring in her buddy Doug Bruno (now the Womens head coach), along with Dave Corzine to become the Mens head coach.  That all backfired when Bill Bradshaw hired Kennedy from Florida to be the head coach.  Jeannie and her brother Mike then became very uncooperative in attempting to get rid of Bradshaw for letting Kennedy interfere with their plans.  Bradshaw \"resigned\" and Jeannie took his place.  Doug had become to popular as the womens coach and was making a boatload of money from his camps.  \n\nFast forward a couple of years and the only thing DePaul has now is better facilities.  They are continually beat up in every sport in the Big East and can no longer recruit the Blue Chip athlete, especially those from the Chicago area.  \n\nThe programs get worse, and no one will fire Jeannie due to the fact that she has been there since she was an 18 year old college Freshman.  It seems as only she and and the Leniti/Bruno/Ponsetto mafia buy into her bullshit anymore.  I know of plenty of DePaul Alumni that will not give a dime until the Lenti's are out of there.  They are killing DePaul with their own ego and control.",

            "comment": "There definitely need to be changes, but athletics are also a hard sell at the school and its not just because the men's basketball team has majorly sucked. There is such a general apathy amongst students about athletics and even DePaul in general. It is overwhelmingly pathetic the amount of students who attend school at DePaul, but do not want to support anything to do with it. Students always wear clothing from other schools (especially Big Ten schools) and I think we are one of the only universities that had a clothing drive where we will give you a free shirt if you turn in another school's apparel. I know people who went to big state schools who are so proud to wear their school's name, and it's sad our students don't feel the same. \n\nIn reference to saying that all our teams suck in the Big East, that's just not true. The women's basketball team has done very well, and men's and women's soccer and softball have had pretty decent seasons as well (at least they did a few years ago). Lenti (the softball coach) is actually a pretty good coach and I believe is in the National Fastpitch Coaches Hall of Fame. I do hear he's kind of a jerk, though. \n\nThere are a lot of things in the department that should change, and its not just recruiting, but how we market the school and department as a whole. I guess marketing is hard, though, when your product isn't that appealing. \n\nHopefully, we can get a new stadium (although, from what I've heard, most options STILL will be nowhere near campus) and maybe that will help. Otherwise, I'm really debating on whether to buy season tickets. ",

                    "comment": "There needs to be a culture change. I do not blame the student body but how DePaul as a school is marketed. I remember when I was looking through colleges, Notre Dame had an entire page dedicated to their football on their pamphlet. This was during the Charlie Weiss era when they were mediocre at best. Regardless, comparing Notre Dame football to DePaul basketball is not fair. But there was a point when it was (when they were selling out All State and had nationally televised games all the time). We lost that culture and there has been little effort on the part of the athletic department to regain it.\n\nThe administration is willing to pay for OP's ridiculous salary. I think they have shown their willingness to help the department. However, nothing else has been done. \n\nI see people on campus wearing DePaul shirts constantly but I do agree. There is too much apathy. This is the culture the department has to work with (which I realize is a big challenge to overcome) but as a current student, I see nothing.\n\nYes, the women's basketball team is solid year in and year out, they have a pretty great active streak of NCAA tournaments appearances. Softball is also decent, they hover around the top 25 every few years. I also hear the softball coach is a jerk too. Men's is decent and women's is decent, one of them had a top 25 appearance recently. But guess what....it doesn't matter because DePaul does not care about sports. Not to mention that the men's team, like it or not, is the most important team at DePaul. If anything, all efforts should be focused on them (and the women's team).\n\nA new stadium will solve some problems, but it won't guarantee anything. If the men's team wins, people will travel where they have to to see them. I am tired of hearing JLP and OP being so reliant on a stadium. \n\nIt also does not help when there is absolutely no pressure, anywhere, on OP. Father H. (president) told the Sun-Times this season (with a whopping 2 Big East wins, they won 3 last year) was a step in the right direction. I am curious if he even went to any of the games. We have the BE rookie of the year in Cleveland Melvin, and he has developed very little.\n\nThere are some conflicting points in my post. I apologize. ",

I'm a recent graduate, and when I went there, it was like pulling teeth to get people to wear FREE t-shirts. Seriously, they passed the stuff out like candy, why not wear the gear?! I don't even go to the school anymore, but DePaul t-shirts still make up at least half of my t-shirt collection and I love representing the school. \n\nThe whole thing with OP is getting ridiculous. I remember when we were about to hire a new coach and there was a lot of speculation on who we would hire and people actually got pretty excited for awhile. Then we hired OP and a lot of people didn't even know who he was. He did great at some other schools, but clearly there is just something here that he is not able to work with, and it's unfortunate because his contract is so long. He has some talented players, but it feels like they still flail or don't play up to their whole potential or improve year after year. \n\nAlso, now we are losing four players. (http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20130409/sports/704099859/?interstitial=1) None of them (save Moses...maybe) really made that big of a difference, but I have to wonder what forced these players to want to look elsewhere (besides the fact that the team is not very good). \n\nIn reference to Father Holtschneider, I actually asked him once if he went to the games because I was skeptical as well. He claims he goes to almost all, and I have seen him in his box at a few. A lot of the times he's at the games it's obviously more for the politics than for him to watch the game. \n\nI don't know how to really handle these situations, but it seems like maybe they should listen more to current students, recent graduates and alumni. The apathy is hard to overcome, but there are definitely pockets of people who care deeply for the school and program. It doesn't seem like they want to reach out or listen to anyone and just want to run everything how it's been running for decades which clearly isn't working. Until we have more input, or stop going to the games completely, it doesn't seem like they'll get the point. ",

I was around when they first started those and have been to one or two. They should open it up to a more general public because a lot of the people who attended really had no interest in sports or being there, so their input wasn't really that valuable. A lot of them really just wanted to see what free stuff their organization could get from athletics, but all power to 'em I guess! Hopefully the other people that are attending are getting something out of it, while providing some constructive stuff for the department.  ",

One time my friend caught him masturbating into football helmets in the equipment room and on multiple occasions has shown up to the laundry room to 'help' but instead fondles and smells the sweaty jock straps.  I'm glad that you brought this up because it is about time DePaul's athletic department had some big changes. ",

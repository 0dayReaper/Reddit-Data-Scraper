What could be better than that?\n\nA lot of things, tbh, but I\u2019ve been at DPU for nearly thirty years, know a good chunk of the people who teach in Honors, and they\u2019re all pretty great.\n\nSomeone already mentioned that classes are capped at twenty, and they really hold to that limit. And I think (but I could be wrong) that Honors students get first crack at registration, so you\u2019re more likely to get into classes you want or need before they fill.\n\nI\u2019d go for it. YMMV.",

There are some exclusive networking events on campus and activities just for honors students but I'm sure if you just asked a faculty member they'd let you go. You get an earlier class registration date and a senior honors gala, along with honors classes of course. The class registration perk is nice but there are less honors core classes than regular and can be hard to get into. Wasn't really a fan of the professors but that might just be me.",

            "comment": " DePaul Honors Program here. If you are looking to be seriously challenged and graduate as a critical thinker who feels prepared to tackle societal challenges and injustices, the Honors Program is for you. \n\nHonors classes are capped at 20 students, so students get the opportunity to engage deeply and authentically with not only the class material but the professor and students. Honors classes are taught in a seminar style, making classes feel much more like an interactive community of learners sharing ideas and discussing issues and solutions, as opposed to more traditional classroom settings where students are often expected to learn passively. If grad school is in your future, the independent research opportunities we offer can help to enhance your applications.\n\nWe also offer exclusive co-curricular leadership opportunities, like having a peer mentor to help you transition to DePaul, chances to volunteer in the Chicago community, and career-oriented events to help prepare you for interviews and resume-building, just to name a few. \n\nUltimately, your decision to join the Honors Program depends on what you want to get out of your college experience. For students who are interested in a challenging, social-justice-based curriculum, planning on attending grad school, or simply looking to join a small community of serious-minded students within the larger campus of DePaul, Honors would be a good fit.

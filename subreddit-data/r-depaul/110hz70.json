    "postText": "We international students are already paying a fortune in tuition, application fees and other costs, and now DePaul wants us to pay 290 USD for evaluating our transcripts? Mind you this is BEFORE the application review, so if our application gets rejected, do you know how much of a loss that is going to be?\n\nMany of us are from developing countries, where the USD is way higher than our local currency\n\nWhy not just demand unofficial transcripts for application review, like all the other universities and if a student gets an admit, they can get their transcripts evaluated?\n\nReferring to MS CS applications",

If a student can\u2019t easily afford that fee, they probably won\u2019t be able to show bank records that prove they have the financial ability to pay for their education.",

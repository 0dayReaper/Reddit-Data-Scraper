I was looking into BJB properties but the unit I was looking has already been rented. \n\nAny other suggestions? I'm pretty stumped.",

Howard is kinda a horrible area, like whatever you do stay away from the area around juneway terrist. \nId recommend moving down a little, areas around Thorndale and Granville (this is Edgewater if I remember correctly) is a lot nicer. Its also on top of aldi",

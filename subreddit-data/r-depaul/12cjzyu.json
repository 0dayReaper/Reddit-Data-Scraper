    "postText": "I am a senior in high school and have narrowed my list down to two options: DePaul and UMN. They would be pretty similar in cost. I have toured both schools and really like both. I plan on majoring in communications and digital media. I love that DePaul is in Chicago and has a lot of opportunities for what I\u2019d want to do as a career, however I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll miss out on the college experience because it\u2019s so different from the more traditional state school experience. If anyone has experience at either school or with my major please let me know what you like/didn\u2019t like about it. Thank you!",

            "comment": "They are completely different experiences. As a Communication major, you'll spend a lot of your 'university' time down in the Loop in high rises. If you go to UMTC, it is much more of a traditional college feel, but while you're not terribly far from downtown Minneapolis or St. Paul, you're definitely not right in the middle of things. Cost of living is definitely going to be a little bit less in the Twin Cities, but public transit is way better here in Chicago. Tough choice - Both places are amazing!",

We have visited twice there the past months, we're heading there one more time.\n\nHave you visited both campuses?  Are you a MN resident? UMN is very urban but is laid out much more like a traditional campus.  I think transit is great around/near campus for most students purposes, my kid uses it all the time.  Are you considering grad school?   \n\nHonestly, this is a win-win choice.",

UMN is more of the traditional college experience and is a very excellent public university. According to statistics overall UMN is a better school academically. But I couldn\u2019t bear those harsh winters. Chicago is cold enough for me. But imo DePaul would be better as you have connections in a major city. Either are both great options it\u2019s up to your preference! Good luck !",

To note on the college experience, you def won\u2019t get the traditional experience here. You get the \u201cbig city life.\u201d There\u2019s not really school spirit, frat parties, etc. what makes up for that is that you explore how big Chicago is. In my POV, you can get the city life later and anywhere. You won\u2019t ever get the traditional college experience again yk. I\u2019m only a freshmen yet I feel like I\u2019m missing out on that experience already..",

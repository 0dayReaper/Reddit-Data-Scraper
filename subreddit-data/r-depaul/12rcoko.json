            "comment": "This is a very difficult situation lol. Uchicago is a very good school, and it seems fun despite the academic challenge. As for DePaul, there\u2019s no really academic challenges here nor fun ig. \n\nI feel like Uchicago would be the better school mostly because you have a full ride, academic challenge, and better connections and networking. With enough hard work, if medical school is truly your end goal, you can definitely do it. Plus! If you end up not wanting to go to med school, change of major etc,, you\u2019ll have better options with all the resources Uchicago has. You\u2019ll be more open for stuff. \n\nPersonally, DePaul is easy. The pathways program seems very nice as you are set to go to med school. However, the connections and clubs here are..okay at best. The social life is meh. Additionally, if you decide to change your career path you\u2019ll be stuck here with debt (albeit relatively low, but compared to a full ride?)\n\nIn other words, I would say pick uchicago. Full ride. Better school. Take the risk.",

Also, what do you mean by DePaul is easy? Would it be very easy to maintain a 3.7 ish? Also, are you in the pathways?",

Plus, the Uchicago name will go far, like Notre Dame. Schools would accept a student with a good GPA who took challenging classes from Uchicago before they would accept a student from DePaul with a 4.0 who took easy classes. Plus UChicago has their own med program and that may give you the opportunity to volunteer in that dept so you can build a reputation with them before applying to med school. In todays world of student loan interest, a full ride is a no brainer.",

I know there is a good amount of health science club and health science related clubs. I would definitely look into the clubs at uchicago versus DePaul. However, I strongly believe that uchicago has better opportunities due to its reputation and connections.\n\nDePaul is easy, and you\u2019ll definitely be able to manage a 3.7 by focusing on work. I\u2019ve had pretty easy grading and very understandable professors so far. Although it is a bit faster because it\u2019s on a quarter system, you meet less with your classes. Usually a Monday/Wednesday and Tuesday/Thursday schedule. The norm is that you also get fridays off (unless you have a lab or decide to take a class that meets on friday). So you have plenty of time in the weekend to do work. The amount of workload isn\u2019t a lot either. It would only be really challenging if you tend to procrastinate a lot.\n\nYou also get a very long winter break (from around thanksgiving to new years).\n\nI\u2019m also not in the pathways program. Hopefully someone in that program can give you more insight on that part!",

A lot of people, that I know of, start failing classes freshmen year so you're really on your own in regard to staying motivated. Plus, the overwhelming majority of people don't put in the effort that's required for grad school (like to get a good gpa) so it can be pretty isolating. Yes, UChicago will be harder but you'll be surrounded by people who also want to work hard and will support/understand you. DePaul is not well known for its STEM department, more for the business and theatre schools. Additionally, DePaul is HEAVILY commuter so it can be kind of hard to make friends or form study groups, since most people just go to class and go straight home. The clubs, that I know of, are pretty inactive. UChicago is an incredible opportunity and since you got in, the admissions committee obviously believes you can be successful there. Plus a full ride!! In my opinion, UChicago has opportunities that cannot be matched at DePaul.",

I've been in a class of like 40 people and maybe 8 of us showed up to every class. The bar scene is pretty prominent here too so sometimes people just prioritize having fun over school.

For the past 2 years I have been talking classes at Oakton to try and get my bachelors in finance. \n\nHow possible is it to get my bachelors at depaul with my current schedule.\n\nThanks all",

We do 4 classes a quarter btw. \n\nThis is also the registers list of all the classes we offered this quarter. You can see which ones you might need and how they are offered. Since some are offered async or in person.\n\nhttps://offices.depaul.edu/university-registrar/schedule-of-classes/Pages/default.aspx#",

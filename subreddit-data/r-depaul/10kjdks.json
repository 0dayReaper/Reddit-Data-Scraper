You have to either do a research or a project. Both option requires skills that you may not have early in the degree program. It\u2019s one of the classes that demand time since it\u2019s a 500 level course so I don\u2019t recommend saving it for the last. If you are an average student, you will likely pass but just the anxiety of it being the last class add pressure which I would avoid for the capstone.",

    "postText": "So I live in the Naperville area and have narrowed my selection down to 2 schools (North Central College and DePaul). No matter what I choose I\u2019d be commuting to both obviously the only difference would be that DePauls commute would be longer since NCC is right around the corner. I just wanted some opinions on what I should choose. I honestly wouldn\u2019t really mind the longer commute for DePaul and would love to go to the city I just feel like I wouldn\u2019t get a solid social life so staying more local would be the way to go. No matter where I go I plan on transferring after 2 years to a school in the west coast or south. Please let me know what you guys think!",

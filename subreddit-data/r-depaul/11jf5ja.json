    "postText": "Hi I am a potential incoming freshman (still deciding between 3 schools, but I love DePaul).  I applied early action and put down my housing deposit in mid-January.  I then found a roommate and requested her on the portal about a week ago.  I was just curious: what is the probability of us getting the dorm we wanted?  I'll be fine no matter where I'm at, but I know housing isn't guaranteed.  Is there any advantage we have with putting my deposit down early and already having a request in?  Is University Hall Double Deluxe a highly sought-after dorm, meaning that it might be harder to get? Thanks!",

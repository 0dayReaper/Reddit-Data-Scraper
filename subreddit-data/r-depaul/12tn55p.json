    "postText": "When my kid applied back in fall, they were accepted to the school, but never even got an interview for the school of theater to do production management. Every other school they applied to, they were accepted into the theater school, including Syracuse. With DePaul\u2019s budget shortfall, would they reconsider an application? I get that the theater school is pretty cut-throat but is it even something that can be attempted? How can they say no to money, especially as an alumni?",

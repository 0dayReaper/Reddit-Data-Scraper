    "postText": "I applied to Depaul early action and was accepted around the middle of December. I also sent in my financial aid before the deadline. I know financial aid was supposed to be sent at the beginning of February, but I still haven't received mine. Basically, I was just wondering if anybody has received their financial aid at all, and if I'm being too antsy about it then please let me know lol. Depaul is my #1 choice and aid and scholarships are a huge factor for me when deciding on a college. I've been checking almost every day since February started lol",

They'll be able to give you a time line. \n\nAlso, by any chance are you a first generation student? I can certainly share a bunch more scholarships for that classification",

Reappeal your financial aid always, always ask for more. \n\nNext DePaul has some program that freshman apply for that take effect in their sophmore year. One of them is ran by the vincentian catholics and I reffered to as VSS. The application open in winter quarter every year and are for freshman to apply to. It focuses on community service and volunteering. Honestly great program and pays $6000 every year for three years. \n\nNext is the Arnold Mitchell fellows. Application opens sometime between fall and winter quarter of students freshman year. This program is a 2 credit class each quarter for one year. Dont worry it won't throw students off their academic goals or cost them extra. Students at depaul pay for 18 credits but most only use 16. Anyway. Class comes with funding and a publishing at the end. If you wish to state in the program to pursue research down the road they have a program called McNair. McNair will help pay for grad school application and campus tours for grad school too. So if you're in a degree that you know will require a masters (medical or something like that) than its a great program for you. \n\nNext is a program outside depaul, but still for freshman to apply and do during their sophmore year. And like the two above first gen status is required. Its called America Needs You (ANY), great program. You'll meet 1-2 times a month on a Saturday for 2 years. Every semester they'll give you 500$ for professional development as long as you meet the requirements. (Like showing up for the meeting, doing your homework, keeping a good GPA, etc). The program also pairs you with a mentor, does your resume, offers workshops on professional skills, mock interview skills. Etc. Meetings normally take place in one of the big buildings in the loop so convince for all. They all have partner companies that they'll help you apply for internships with like PWC for example.",

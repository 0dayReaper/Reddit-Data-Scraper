I would like to make a larger list, so in your experience, which ones have you seen? \n\nAlso can any club decide to give out cords?\n\nThese are the ones I believe give cords:\nTrio SSS, Nuero club, LGBTQ+ (they do lavender graduation), and meet me at the mission.\n\nThese are the ones I know give sashes:\nTrio McNair, Greek Life, and Honor Societies.",

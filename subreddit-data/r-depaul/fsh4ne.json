If i do work where i also relax it is impossible to focus. I personally do work at my dining room table, not rly a soft environment, and I work right as I get up in the morning with a cup of coffee. That's my personal routine and it helps a lot.",

What seems to help is doing your whole routine as if you\u2019re going to classes - wake up at a good time, shower, get fully dressed (or maybe slightly undressed since you\u2019re still home) and then sitting down somewhere other than your room or normal setup. It\u2019s amazing how much it affects your subconscious and really switches you into that \u201cwork\u201d mode.",

It was a good reset button for my feelings and attitude. I'd recommend it if you can if you are feeling burnt out on life or responsibilities.",

    "postText": "Hi! What sort of opportunities did you guys have in terms of internships? (for film and like what companies do you guys usually go to, or is it different everytime). Also how well does DePaul prepare/assist you at landing these internships (and eventually jobs out of college?) And could you give some examples of what they do for the internships? Like are they PAs or just handling paperwork, etc? And how flexible is their program with study abroad??? AND IS CINESPACE REALLY AS GREAT AS IT SOUNDS Sorry for all the questions and thanks so much!",

One is now editing in LA and the other two are working on the Chicago shows they shoot at Cinespace.  It seems like a really excellent opportunity for students at depaul",

Osu's film program is still relatively new so IDK about their connections but I talked with a senior in the major recently and she said that a lot of the seniors already had jobs lined up for after graduation from internships and networking. OSU's also getting a new building but I'm not sure about the studio part, I feel like working in an industry-grade studio like Cinespace would be better for learning about lighting/rigging/hands-on stuff like that. And thanks! Im going to need it :')",

From first hand experience, you\u2019ll also receive much more aid as long as you have above a 3.5. For context I\u2019m paying $23,000 a year after FAFSA. Best of luck in your college journey!!",

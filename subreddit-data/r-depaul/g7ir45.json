    "postText": "Freshman here. Took my first exam yesterday and prof used lockdown and Zoom. I live in a relatively unsafe neighborhood with very shady upstairs neighbors. I have come back to living with my parents for this quarter. During my exam, upstairs neighbors began having loud sex and talking about drugs. Prof forces us to keep video and mics on during zoom. Prof accused me of purposefully having something to do with the upstairs neighbors' behavior to\"inconvenience\" the entire class. I have no idea why the prof thinks that ordering people to have loud sex and engage in rowdy behavior would somehow produce a good outcome for the rest of the class. Ended up just saying that it could have been a form of cheating and I was reported for it. No idea what to do or how to approach this situation. I am a first gen college student and parents have no advice either. I am just flabbergasted at the entire situation.",

Cheating is a serious allegation and you are entitled to due process. Talk to your professor again via email so you can document the conversation and see if the matter can be resolved. If not, you have evidence and should consult with the department chair or Dean for the college. \n\nhttps://catalog.depaul.edu/student-handbooks/undergraduate/university-information/complaints-and-grievances/",

I never had to deal with them personally when I was at DPU, but I heard good things.\n\nIf I were you, I might email the Dean of Students proactively and just explain the situation like you did here and ask them how to proceed.",

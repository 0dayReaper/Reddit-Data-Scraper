    "postText": "So I decided to do a stats course this quarter, its IT 223 and its horrible. Like its 4-6 quizzes a week broken up between 16-24 min lectures. Then an assignment at the end. Im trying. I really am, but its week 3 and we've barely even touched R. Like we are learning how to do stats by hand and half the assignments have me hand drawing a graph as we are doing under the curve numbers.i can't do this and really want to take the W, but I need to know that the other stats courses aren't like this?like I took this one because its async and I thought it would be fine, but I spent 12 hours doing the work for week 2. Like I can do all my other homework in the time this one class takes. \n\nSo can anyone tell me if the other stats courses are easier? Do any of them just focus more on how to use the software?or is there an extreme amount of work that you have to do by hand?",

Idk if it's the exact same for you, but it can be calculated on a TI-84 or stat calculator. I learned about ways to use my Calc. for stats. on YouTube. It cuts my homework time in half.",

We haven't had any quizzes yet, we do our hw in class and only have to read outside of it, and all quizzes (including midterms and finals) are open books. It's just how the professor decided to teach the course, which heavily sucks. We also use software on the depual virtual engine, we haven't done anything by hand at all",

But let's say you bomb it. If you get a 40% on it. The max grade you can get in the class is now a D. If you get a 50% the max grade is a c-. Oh and if you don't do the final or midterm you fail automatically. Let's me just say 20% is not supposed me actually be 50-60%.",

Like I dont think he is a bad dude, I just think he structured the course for students to learn one way and if you can't learn by watching long videos for several hours straight that's on you. Which isn't great, because teachers upload slides or reading, there's none. What is your teacher for the in person class having you read?",

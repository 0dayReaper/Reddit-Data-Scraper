    "postText": "Incoming undergrad freshman, I got accepted into general psychology. Lately my grades have slipped due to the difficulty and other personal factors. My grades are fine (4.9gpa) with the exception of a borderline C in calculus and currently a D in an AP Class.\n\nI hope to possibly get them both at a C by the end of the semester but if for whatever reason I get both Ds, am I at risk? These classes are extra as I have gotten my credits and requirements out of the way.\n\nOn top they offered me a 6 figure scholarship.\n\nThanks!",

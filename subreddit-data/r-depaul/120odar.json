    "postText": "I am a senior in high school, and considering both Iowa State University and DePaul. I would attend Iowa State because they offer me $43,969 for a year including living expenses, but DePaul is a big city which is I will likely have more opportunities at Chicago and they offer $50,000 to me per year. However, I had been seeing that Iowa State's computer science major ranking is higher than DePaul's in different sources. Is there anything special at DePaul\u2019s cs program that Iowa State doesn\u2019t offer and which one should I choose? Thank you.",

            "comment": "As a freshman who asked this same exact question (different school choice), I can offer a unique insight. I've come to realize if the program is not an Ivy League college or UIUC, it genuinely doesn't matter. There is a point of diminishing returns when it comes to state schools' CS programs. At that point, you're basically choosing what I like to call \"distinguishing factors\", which basically means the cool features or perks the school offers as a \"byproduct\". For Depaul, this would be the networking opportunities since it's in a big city. There are teach career fairs here, and there are always 100s of companies recruiting for internships and jobs. Another thing is that DePaul is particularly good at matching students with employers, If you somehow make it through this program without getting a job, you did something very wrong.  Also, the quarter system is particularly interesting things move a little faster but if you can manage, it's very rewarding. In terms of the coursework, it's comprehensive and extremely well-rounded you definitely get a little bit of everything C, C++, Python, Java, Systems, Operating systems web dev stuff, mobile dev, AI, and machine learning. The professors are kind of hit or miss sometimes; some are really good, and some are meh, but I don't think that there are any professors that are totally garbage. It's definitely on you to choose professors whose teaching styles align with yours, but as long as you do your due diligence, the professors are great for the most part. Another thing is that the Math requirements are very lax; there are only 2 math classes that you are required to take, which are discrete math 1 and 2.  This brings me to my final point about DePaul's program. It is a very practical program, versus a theory-based CS program which is really just a glorified math degree. You will learn more on-the-job skills here, than at other colleges, which is why people are able to get hired quickly here, in my opinion. Those are the things I have observed in my first year here. Hope that was helpful.",

If you want to be in the middle of nowhere in a small city with the traditional college experience or living in the 3rd biggest US city where there are MANY internships and connections that can help you get a good high paying job. Also know at DePaul you will have to go between both campuses (lincoln park and the loop) and classes are Monday - Thursday. I don't know any CS majors that have a class on Friday. ALSO Diversity is a huge factor. DePaul is very diverse in a big diverse city.",

I can\u2019t tell you a single Iowa State grad that I know in the field.\n\nEducation is what you make of it, and rankings don\u2019t really mean much in the real world.  I would rather hire a sharp, eager learner with great business instincts from DeVry University than a poor communicator from MIT.  \n\nI would argue introductions and connections go farther than school prestige when it comes to real world application.",

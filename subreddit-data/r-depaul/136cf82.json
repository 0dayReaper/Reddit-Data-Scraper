    "postText": "I\u2019ve been trying to contact my academic advisor for about a week now. \n\nIt started with me trying to send her an email with some questions about summer classes but the email immediately bounced back to me with the automated response saying that the email address I was trying to reach is not registered with DePaul at all. It\u2019s the email I\u2019ve been using whenever I needed to talk to her (which is rarely but still) over the past two years now and is also the one listed in multiple places on Campus Connect when it lists my advisors. The last time I got an email from her was a couple weeks into winter quarter so it hasn\u2019t been super long since last hearing from her. \n\nI ended up messaging my faculty advisor for help with the summer course questions and he helped me out to the best of his ability but in his email he mentioned things being \u201chectic with the academic advisor situation\u201d so now I\u2019m curious as to what\u2019s going on, because it\u2019s clearly something more than just her email being changed or something small like that. \n\nWhen talking to my academic advisor in the past, she never really knew what she was talking about, to the point where most times I l\u2019ve had concerns over whatever class related stuff this year, I\u2019ve just talked to my CSD clinician or took a deep dive on the DePaul website to figure it out myself. She even told me a few months ago when we had to meet about an academic probation related thing verbatim that she doesn\u2019t know how to do her job or what her position really is. She admitted to me that she just looks stuff up online like I do but with the added power of being able to make small changes to my class schedule if I need (mainly in the past when I had a core requirement class that was placed in the open electives section on my degree progress report for some reason and she switched it to the right place). Anyways, I think she might\u2019ve been fired for not knowing how to do her job for at least two years, but that\u2019s just a guess. Or it could\u2019ve been part of the whole budget cut thing, who knows. \n\nI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just kind of weird that it looks like she doesn\u2019t work at DePaul anymore and hasn\u2019t for at least a week now, but I (and I\u2019m assuming her other students) haven\u2019t been informed of any changes, nor has Campus Connect assigned me to another advisor and still has her listed. Has anyone else had something like this happen?\n\nUPDATE: It looks like a lot of other film majors / CDM students are experiencing the same thing and as a commenter pointed out, the CDM advising website is being cryptic about film majors only contacting their faculty advisors for the time being. The DePaulia has been contacted and they\u2019re looking into it. Something weird is definitely going on.",

Wendy Roderweiss hasn\u2019t responded to my emails until recently, and Gary Novak reads only half of your email. I used to be \u2728careful\u2728 about name dropping, but I\u2019m paying for all of this, so whatever.",

I just got a quick email saying that she was no longer at DePaul and that for now, I wasn't going to be assigned another academic advisor and just to talk to my faculty advisor. \n\nRight now, this is listed on the CDM academic advising website: \n\n**\"Students in the following majors** should use their assigned faculty advisor as the primary point of contact for all advising related needs\n\n* Animation (BA/BFA/MA/MFA)\n* Creative Producing (MFA)\n* Documentary (MFA)\n* Film &amp; Television (BA/BFA/MS/MFA)\n* Screenwriting (MFA)\"\n\n[https://www.cdm.depaul.edu/Student-Resources/pages/meetourstaff.aspx](https://www.cdm.depaul.edu/Student-Resources/pages/meetourstaff.aspx)\n\nSo, something major is going on.

They\u2019ve always strongly advised students to meet with faculty advisors first. \n\nThat said, if your CDM staff advisor is awol or just not good, reach out to the director or asst director for CDM advising for guidance\u2014last time I checked this was John Glatz and Katie Schiller\u2026assuming they aren\u2019t the disappeared advisors?",

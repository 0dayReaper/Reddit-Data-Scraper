    "postText": "My son has been accepted as a freshman into the film production program.   We can\u2019t  attend any of the live tours as we live in another state.  We will be in Chicago Monday 3/13 for other reasons and will visit the Loop campus. We tried to get  someone to discuss the program with, but admissions have been giving us the run around.   \n\nIs there a current film student who would be willing to have a chat about the program with my son, so he has more information about the program. \n\nThanks",

(The rest of the university is nice. Its just admissions that is crap.) \n\nThis is a link for the depaul visits. The 4th option listed allows you to request to speak with a current student or professional from your program of interest. \n\nhttps://www.depaul.edu/admission-and-aid/visit-depaul/undergraduate-virtual-visits/Pages/default.aspx\n\nIf you have any general campus questions I can do my best to answer those.",

(I have friends who are tour guides for admissions is why I know this.) \n\nYou can show up for the 10am Lincoln park tour 2400 N sheffield Ave and asked to be waitlisted, because its probably. They have never seen anyone turned away from the waitlist as people always no show. The first second hour is an information session with an admissions counselor and the first hour is a tour. If you need to dip out early to get to the loop just go. They won't be mad. Or you can also go to this building and ask to speak to an admissions counselor. There are always counselors on staff.",

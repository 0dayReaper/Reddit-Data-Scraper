I had a lot of fun with my Discover class that first week, and it\u2019s kind of nice getting used to the campus before everyone is back. Regardless though, the transition isn\u2019t bad, especially since class sizes are usually small.",

Because in college, 99% of the time, you have at least a week to get something done rather than just one night or even a couple days. \n\nAs far as the first week, professors often just go over the syllabus, maybe lecture a bit. There's always the awkward, \"introduce yourself, say you major and hometown...\" thing. But, often, there aren't a ton of assignments the first week, especially in classes that are predominantly freshman (level 100s). \n\nGood luck!",

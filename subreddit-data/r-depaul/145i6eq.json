But I remember seeing it I think on a poster outside the computer science (CDM) building. \n\nAnyway, there are tons of students that live not far from either campus. Chicago is a fun place and there is always a lot of do. Also, tons of diverse folks here. I'm into board games and some other things and totally found a group of others interested. We still have game nights when we can.",

    "postText": "Don't even know how to explain this story. I'm in a general chemistry class and had one of the lab TAs suggest they were interested in me and wanted to spend time together. I have gone to their office hours before but everything was fine until right after the withdraw date passed. This person saw me outside of class and elsewhere on campus and tried to be friendly. I didn't realize this person's intentions until they asked to walk me to the train one night then tried to ask me out. I politely declined then realized this person was no longer civil to me in lab and was short with me when I came to office hours. I stopped talking to this person and only asked questions to my lecture and lab professors. Last week I heard from older friends that this TA had taken pics of portions of my lab reports and sent them around then started making fun of whatever I had written. This person came onto me and was visibly upset when I declined the date. However, this person immediately turned around and told other people that I was \"cute\" for thinking I'd have a chance with this person. Then they sent around pictures of my work and tried to embarrass me for it. I rejected a person because I didn't think it was professional but also simply because I have no interest in this person. Their response was to try to get people to stop talking to me and try to embarrass me among others in the science programs. I don't feel like I deserve to be subjected to a narrative only filled with fabricated stories just to pad some guy's ego?",

            "comment": "Fill out a report/call the misconduct hotline.  Both those things you mentioned go against the code of conduct that the TA (ironically) likely recently completed (as the yearly e-mail was just sent out last week)\n\nhttps://offices.depaul.edu/compliance-and-risk-management/Pages/default.aspx\n\n&gt; The learning and work environment should be free from inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature. Title IX is a federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, including harassment and sexual and relationship violence, in federally funded education programs and activities. In accordance with DePaul\u2019s Catholic and Vincentian values and its role as an educational institution, sexual harassment is not tolerated in the learning environment or the work place. Similarly, the university condemns any form of sexual or relationship violence.",

            "comment": "I graduated from DePaul 2 years ago. I was a science major and dealt with someone who didn't handle my rejection well either. I ended up having to out this person to administration in the end because they kept clinging onto this person's completely false facade. Those situations definitely suck but I can tell you that person is just doing damage control. The TA who came onto me claimed that I came onto them instead. I am purposefully omitting pronouns because this person may lurk on this sub, unsure. Regardless, NEVER allow someone to put you in a situation where you feel unsafe. If this person says anything remotely sexual or threatens you, go straight to title IX or the police if you feel necessary. The TA I dealt with never lost their position even after it was determined that they were trying to harass me and cyberbully me because of my rejection. Other advice would be to talk directly to Dr. Shelby. I just looked up the chem dept and she is the dept chair now. I had her in gen chem and she was great. She doesn't put up with anyone's shit. Whatever you've heard about her, only know that people fear her because she actually gets shit done and doesn't put up with any crap. I would even talk to her with the situation as is because no TA should be sending around anything regarding other students. I'm sure she will adamantly handle the situation and will potentially prevent the TA from being a TA in the future. Good luck and PM if you ever need to",

    "postText": "I have to make a decision on this pretty soon and I am leaning towards DePaul because I personally like the school more but UIC is apparently a better school for Computer Science. Is the computer science program here really lower quality than the one at UIC? A major requirement for cs at UIC is 3 years of calculus which is putting me off from going there if I could get the same degree here without having to do that but it would be worth it if it meant I would have better employment opportunities.  \n\nOne thing I am unsure of is if I would personally like the quarter system here. On one hand you can take many more classes and presumably graduate early but DePaul needs 192 credit hours compared to UIC's 120 so even with the quarter system I'd still graduate in 4 years with a regular course load. Plus I don't really like how short summer break is compared to other schools but I would like to hear input about the quarter system and if it really is better. Graduating early and getting into the job market faster is a big priority for me.",

I graduate early next year and after looking at my time here, I did wish I received a better and more updated curriculum that is not mainly theory based. I heard UIC is more practical and you get to code more! If you are guaranteed the internship at UIC, take that opportunity, as I have not heard of much help for internships in CS at DePaul.",

            "comment": "I personally really like the quarter system. You get Thanksgiving to New Years off every year. And, you get June to September off. Yeah, you go a bit longer in the summer than other schools, but we also start later in the fall. It's a trade off.\n\nEach quarter is 10 weeks with an additional week for finals. I've found that schedule to be very engaging. Most classes move really quickly as a result and focus on the most important topics. There isn't much \"fluff.\" \n\nI know a lot of students that still manage to graduate early, myself included. I am finishing a whole year early and have a minor. If you are transferring credits (AP or dual enrollment or such) or if you play it smart with your electives, you can definitely finish earlier than 4 years.",

Also, UICs program, i have heard, is a lot less inclusive and has a lot more weed out classes. DePaul CS professors, for the most part, are very helpful and the classes don\u2019t seem like they\u2019re designed to make you miserable. Another thing that is nice about DePaul is their options for online classes, almost every class has an online option which is very convenient if you can\u2019t make a normal class time. I highly recommend DePaul CS.",

Money is not a big issue for me and I could afford the $10k a year without taking loans but its something to consider. What I like about DePaul and the quarter system is the ability to graduate super early which is a big priority for me as well as being able to take a lot of classes a lot faster but on the other hand UIC is a bigger name and is ranked a lot higher.",

Unless you are looking towards analytics and data science, you won\u2019t use any calculus in CS in your real life job so not sure if it\u2019s worth to study that for 3 years. If you really want to compare the program then check the faculty for both schools who are teaching major courses like Data Structure, Algorithms, Database, Programming etc. Check their industry experience and see which one has more hand on knowledge or academic papers etc.",

UIC's CS program is a lot more rigorous than DePaul because of all the required classes and I'm wondering if employers take notice to UIC's higher ranking. A reason I want to go to DePaul is because it would be easier to get a CS degree and to graduate early and get into the job market sooner however apparently UIC has a guaranteed internship program and DePaul doesn't so would it be harder for me to get say a software engineering job with a DePaul degree rather than a UIC degree or would it be the same?",

If you have talent then you don\u2019t have to worry about that.",

If you do not stay on top of your work, you will fall behind quickly as it\u2019s only 10 weeks as opposed to 15 weeks. Additionally, while you do meet with your class twice a week, the class time is longer. It\u2019s usually around 1 hour and 30 minutes, which sometimes can be so dreadful if you pick a class you\u2019re not interested in. Sometimes, classes can range to 3 hours. I believe thats mainly art classes, but I\u2019m not sure it applies to CS classes as well. \n\nOverall I just don\u2019t like how fast paced and long the classes are in quarter system. You get more off time to do work, I guess? But it\u2019s just so much work in a short period of time, which only makes me forget what I learned.\n\nI also think it makes sense UIC requires clac, as CS is a lot of math. It just prepares you for all the math you\u2019re gonna have to do in CS\u2026",

A few people noticed some classes were capped at 10 students per class or listed as remote when registering for fall. I hope we see some update from administration regarding autumn quarter soon so we know what\u2019s going on",

Each color has two \u201cdirections\u201d, think of an oval and a train on each of its long side going the opposite direction. And there are little breaks in the oval for the stops. Now imagine like 7 of these some overlap some don\u2019t. \n\nThen you have buses that run on a grid system super simple. \n\nUber/lyft \n\nYou can rent bicycles called \u201cdivvy\u201d but you\u2019re from Cali so you\u2019re familiar with that.\n\nYou\u2019re gonna receive a \u201cu-pass\u201d from depaul this is your cta card that\u2019s you use to pay for trains/busses\n\nUse google maps to see what color line/direction and stop to get off. Other than that meet new people, explore the city, though winter sucks hahaha.",

It's not always horrible outside and two or three layers should suffice but there are points during winter quarter where you're gonna need a parka or something like that. Pretty much something that's not super thin and is wind resistant is what I wore mostly. Good gloves are key as well as snow boots. Bring snow boots as well cause you don't wanna mess up your shoes after it snows cause that's a bitch to walk through. Other winter shit too like a hat and scarf if you want. Umbrellas are also very nice to have. Sorry for the clothing overload but I hope this answers everything.",

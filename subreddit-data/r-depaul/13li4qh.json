    "postText": "Hi, My name is Nick, I am a student at DePaul for filmmaking/business. I live in East Lake view. I come back to school in the fall. I was wondering if there are any students who work out at XSport fitness on Broadway near the Marianos? I'm really trying to be active more in the gym and my trainer said that I should also try to find a group of people who are a gym focused to help me with consistency. So I thought I would just try to ask on here. But I live on Broadway and Wellington, so it's a quick walk for me. But let me know. If you want to message me, that's fine. I am also aware we live in a time where things are scary and unsafe, so I totally understand if it's something you don't feel comfortable doing. But I just wanted to reach out. I don't think I can use the campus gym because I'm not an active student this quarter. Let me know. I think I'm also going to post this on ask Chicago. Thanks!",

There are 2 credit fitness classes. weight lighting, swimming etc. \n\nIn the fall that ray will once again offer intermural sports. which means you can sign up for free to join a team and play. most play either Monday and Wednesday evenings or Tuesday and Thursday evenings. Theres volleyball, indoor soccer, basketball, racquet ball, and depending on the quarter flag football. (I believe its winter they don't run it.) and a few other sports I think. \n\nThere are also fitness clubs on campus. The two I know are the martial arts club (which i think meets on Thursdays this quarter, you can join on dehub and find out if you're interested), there is also a boxing club. I dont know when they meet but again go to dehub. \n\ngood luck homie!",

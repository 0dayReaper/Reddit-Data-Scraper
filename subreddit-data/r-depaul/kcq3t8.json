Is it better to commit earlier? \n\nThanks! \n\nAlso where are the best places to live off-campus\ud83d\udc40?",

Take a look at the financials and determine which college is going to be the best value based on cost after scholarships. I personally waited until pretty much the last day to commit because there\u2019s no reward to committing earlier. The more time you have to think, the better.",

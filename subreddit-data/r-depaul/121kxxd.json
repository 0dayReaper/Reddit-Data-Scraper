    "postText": "I am planning to do my master's this year in DePaul, and I wanted to know some things:\n\n1. How good is the HCI course?\n2. How much would it cost overall, everything included?\n3. What are some good places of accomodation around? \n4. Will I get in if I apply end of this month? (For fall intake) \n5. Does the spring intake make a big difference?",

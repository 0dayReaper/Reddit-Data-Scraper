    "postText": "I got selected as an undergrad for this program, wanted to know how good is it (education quality). What are the benefits in this program that you won't get in normal accounting or actuarial science major.\nIs this program still good if you don't plan on giving the CPA exam, but accounting is helpful for your future career.\n\nAm an international student, so any advice on coming to depaul or even usa for first time is appreciated.",

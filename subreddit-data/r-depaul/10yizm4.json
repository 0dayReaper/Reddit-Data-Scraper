    "postText": "Greetings everyone! I am an international applicant that applied MS in game programming and was admitted by DePaul recently, I am so glad that I can have this chance to study in Chicago, one of the biggest cities in the USA. The main purpose of this post is that whether someone can tell me about game programming this master program and your opinion about DePaul.\n\n1. If you've attended the program at DePaul, would you recommend it?\n\n2. What's the one thing everyone should know before deciding to attend DePaul?\n\n3. Where I can find a place for housing that no far away from loop campus and located in a safe place? I heard that Chicago is a palce that crime rate is high\n\nIt is so great that you can provide any message for me !",

            "comment": "I got admitted to DePaul masters program (not gaming$ so I don\u2019t currently attend but I\u2019ve been doing a lot of researching and have been able to actually connect with people and talk to them and were able to give me reviews about my specific program but the school in general. \n\nMost people say that it\u2019s a good school, but it\u2019s very expensive and not worth the money. If you plan on staying in chicago or the Midwest you\u2019re more likely to find a job because DePaul holds a lot of weight, but just in that area. If you plan on moving soon after might be more difficult to get a job. \n\nI would consider those things if you plan on staying or not. Entry jobs outside the state and region probably will be easier than a higher leveled position. \n\nLoop, Lincoln park, uptown, Gold Coast, and there\u2019s another one I just forgot the neighborhood name are safe. Anything around immediate campus seem to be safe but they\u2019re more expensive. If you\u2019re looking for cheaper going to rogers park, and a few outside areas have a little more crime but not much wouldn\u2019t recommend if you have night classes because you would have to take the train at night by yourself (Unless you go with a group which seem to be fine)",

I want to get a job in the game industry. I heard that most game companies are located in CA, so I am worried whether those CA companies will consider those midwest or east universities. \ud83d\ude16",

It shouldn\u2019t deter you from DePaul though!\n\nYou have a few options go to DePaul and have you graduate apply to jobs both in CA and the Midwest. If you gets job in CA great! If not, you\u2019ll be able to gain experience in chicago and then where you to went to school won\u2019t matter compared to your experience.",

                                    "comment": "I understand, so the main point is that I should choose a school that is located in an area that has many game companies. I googled that Chicago is the third biggest city in the US. I think that I might have a better chance of getting a job in Chicago. I also found that in the animation career review, this website shows that Depaul is ranked NO.8 in the top 25 game master programs and higher than northeastern University(NO.17). I also applied to the University of South California and The University of Utah's game master program. But they haven't given me an answer yet, after seeing your advice, if I cannot go to these two schools, I might go to DePaul. Thank you for your kindful and incisive advice!\ud83d\ude0a",

    "postText": "I\u2019m thinking of doing 4 classes per quarter and finish the program in 5 quarters. I will not plan on working and will focus solely on the schooling. How reasonable is it, I\u2019ve never done quarter systems, so I feel a little intimidated with the work load. Thoughts??? Opinions???",

            "comment": "I can\u2019t exactly speak from personal experience in the master\u2019s programs since I\u2019m an undergraduate student, but I will say for us that 4 classes in 10 weeks is EXTREMELY stressful. Like, pulling my hair out by midterms kind of stress. I have a few friends in different master\u2019s programs (psych and education specifically) and I get the impression that 2 classes for them is just about the equivalent and the workload is very intense.\n\nMBA Finance might be different but in any case I would personally recommend trying 2 first and see how you fare. If you decide to take 4, keep the withdraw dates for the quarter in mind so you don\u2019t have to pay for classes you aren\u2019t taking. Good luck!",

            "comment": "I\u2019m currently in the MBA full time cohort, which is what you\u2019re essentially describing you want to do. In this program your core classes are essentially chosen for you, they\u2019re preset and you don\u2019t get flexibility until your electives. You pick your electives starting in the 3rd quarter and those are offering typically during the night. \n\nWith that being said it\u2019s a 4 quarter program and you\u2019re done in 18 total months 15 school months. It\u2019s manageable but you need to stay on top of your work. You can reach out to Kellstadt graduate school for other questions too.",

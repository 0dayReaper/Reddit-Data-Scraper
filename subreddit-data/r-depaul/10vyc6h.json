    "postText": "hi! i\u2019m a freshman at Depaul and commute to my classes from the suburbs. although my classmates are nice, i feel very isolated compared to students who live on campus. most of my classes have minimal group discussions and no group projects. im having trouble making friends or even connecting with other students at Depaul and am considering transferring bc of this. bc Depaul doesn\u2019t really have dances, or a football team, or even on campus parties i feel out of options when it comes to socialization outside of classes. i was well liked in high school and never had problems making friends but for some reason i\u2019m struggling socially rn when i never have before. pls give some tips or even advice about what i might be able to do about this or if i should just transfer out atp. ty!",

            "comment": "Hi, \n\nIm also a commuter so I certainly hear you. I think this is a big problem that commuters have as many of us struggle to have on campus friends. \n\nSo few recommendations, attend more events. Most of the events in Lincoln park are hosted in the stu 120ab. Normally they use really big round tables, especially for things like bingo. Normally these tables fill up and they are a great way to socialize. Ask people for their snapchats! I literally had to do this all the time or id never run into anyone again. I also recommend asking for classmates snaps. Not to sound rude or fake, but talk with someone and be like oh my God you're so nice, funny, ect, can I get your snap? \n\nAlso have you considered any clubs or starting any clubs? DePaul has lots of major related clubs, e sports clubs, anime club, ect. Small clubs are also great ways to build connections. Also, at the beginning of every quarter the ray host intermerial games. Normally there's indoor soccer, basketball, volleyball, ect. You can join any team and have no experience. Most of these teams play either m-w evening or t-thur. \n\nAlso if you're religious of any kind there are groups for muslim, Jewish, and catholic life on campus. The catholic life is on the bottom floor of the stu and in my experience you don't have to be crazy religious of any kind to hangout with them. Like they're super nice and the room is always full of students. Just stop in and say hi im new, wanted to see what the space was about, ect. \n\nI also don't know if you have considered rushing for a group. That's a great opportunity to make connections.",

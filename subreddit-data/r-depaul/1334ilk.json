I was already at a low place in my life and being told you'd definitely be placed somewhere only to be told I was \"too old\" (I was a 20yo junior at the time) was devastating. \n\nVery demoralizing process and nearly everyone I met in Greek life at DePaul didn't seem to like it very much.",

I know someone in the male business frat and he told me that every year they try to get two of the pledges to cry so they drop from the program as they always admit more than they need to. I also know a girl from I think its one of the minority business sor that is the same way. So idk.",

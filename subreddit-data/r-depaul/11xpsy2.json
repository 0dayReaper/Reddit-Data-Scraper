Your application would be reviewed like an wait listed student application is. So if you can afford most of the fees, and have a good stats compared to the wait listed students. You have a good chance. Money plays an equal role like ur stats, as late application would result in very less financial aid/merit scholarship for you.",

No aid would also greatly increase ur chance to get in, if you applied late. As a lot of their funds are already used for the ones who were on time.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone.... My daughter (who lives in Texas) was recently admitted to the UT Austin Radio, Television &amp; Film program after being admitted to DePaul late last year. Now, she looking for help in making her decision.\n\n**Cost:**\n\n* **DePaul:** She received the president's scholarship, but that would still leave about $40K annually for tuition, R&amp;B, fees, etc\n* **UT Austin:** We'd be out of pocket about $28K annually\n\nWe're visiting DePaul later this month, but everything we've heard and read about the film program is positive. (She's been to Austin a lot, but we'll officially visit the film school this month as well.) And while she's never been to Chicago, she loves the Midwest &amp; Northeast and prefers to attend college in one of those regions.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* If you've attended the program at DePaul, would you recommend it?\n* Looks like there are two campuses and the Cinescape. Where do most film students take classes?\n* Is it a pain to get between the locations?\n* Is DePaul largely a commuter school?\n* What's the one thing everyone should know before deciding to attend DePaul for film? or what do you which you'd known before attending DePaul's film school?",

Couldn\u2019t be easier. \n\nI think DePaul has a fair amount of commuters since it\u2019s so accessible to the suburbs but they also have a ton of people who stay on campus.",

The environment up here is urban and diverse and the location of DePaul LPC is actually quite safe. Much much better than Chicago &amp; UIC. Your daughter should expect to be living somewhere along the Red, Brown, or Purple line CTA train lines so she could get to Fullerton (LPC) easily, esp. in the Winter. Chicago is the most affordable major city so living off campus would be quite thrifty. Can't say the same about ATX.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went to UTA too. I will forever choose Chicago because of its affordability and public transit.",

            "comment": "Hi, \nSo im not in the film program but I know a lot of people that are, so ill answer best I can. \n\nFrom what most of my friends say, they really enjoy the film program and find a lot of happiness in what they do. They also like that depaul has a program called la quarter. Which is where students can choose to spend a quarter in LA taking classes and working on a production lot. \n\nYes depaul has to campuses plus cinaspace. Lincoln park is home to the schools of liberal and social science, education, hard sciences, music, and theater. Where our loop campus is home to our business school, communications school, law school (graduate program), and computer and digital media, also referred to as CDM. The CDM houses the film school along with many other degrees such as IT, Computer Science, and Game Design just to name a few. \n\nIt isn't a pain to get between each location. Lincoln park to the loop can be traveled to via several different options. We have a private shuttle bus (think the massive coach busses) that leaves every 30-45 minutes. Next option is the train or cta. The cta stop in Lincoln park is called Fullerton. It commutes with red line and brown line all day, then purple line through the rush periods of the day. The purple is the cleanest, followed by the brown, then the red. The red isn't particularly great due to smell, but its the fastest. Purple and brown are roughly 17-20 min rides to the loop campus (cdm is adams and wabash). The red line is about 13-15 minutes and students utilities the Jackson stop. The Jackson stop let's out close to several of our main loop buildings, including the depaul center. Which is on 1 e Jackson. \n\nYes and no. Some students enjoy living on campus because they socialize more, but some prefer to be off campus. It is cheaper to be off campus and depaul doesn't have a mandatory freshman dorm requirement, so its not required unless you really want to experience sharing a room with 1-2 other people. \n\nI am a commuter though. I live near the northern part of the city for several reasons. It is cheaper to live off campus and if you really want to share an entire apartment with a roommate their is a depaul page for it called depaul housing. Im also closer to grocery stores, the beach, ect. But the difference comes down to cost and commute. I commute further but I pay significantly less than living on campus. I have 1 roommate and I pay around 700$ monthly. Dorms are closer to 1200$+ monthly. I also not a lot of other commuters and I know a lot of students who call the dorms home.\n\nAs for commute thats not a cost I have to think about, depaul gives students cta passes so we can ride the bus and train as much as we want. \n\nIm not a film student so I can't attest to what she should know before majoring in film, but I have general advice for students. Remember to take the fun classes too. We have several study abroad classes just for film from Paris to Rome and more. The school also gives out scholarships for every trip. It may not cover it all, but they try to help. \n\nI also have more advice if your kid is a first generation college student, but no worries if not.",

                            "comment": "Of course. I have friends that are on their own in studios for 1000$ or a little more. Its still cheaper than the dorm, but does stack up in cost. So just somthing to consider if she prefers roommates or her own place. \n\nAlso, Chicago's areas are a little hit or miss. So im going to offer a little advice if you decide to look for a place for your daughter here in Chicago. \n\nThe vast majority of students do not live in the loop (the business district around the cdm and depaul center.), you are talking thousands and thousands monthly to rent there. Its not worth it, move back up north. So depauls other campus is in Lincoln park, Lincoln park is a nice area but extremely expensive. So if she wants to live there its still going to be extremely expensive without roommates. Most students live between the diversy (brown and purple stop) and the sheridan (red line stop). These stops are all on the same stretch of track. \n\nAnyway, diversy and Belmont, decent areas. Grocery stores are target and trader joes mostly. If you go to addison its a little more expensive because you're on top of the cubs stadium, but very nice area. I lived between the addison red line (keep in mind there are like 3 addison stops counting different train lines) and Southport brown for my first year. Loved it and it was on top of a jewelosco (like a smiths /albertsons). \n\nThe other area that has a large cluster of students is up north. This is because of Loyola University. So a lot of loyola students live around Thorndale, Granville, and Loyola redline stops. There are a lot of restaurants in this area and an Aldi. Aldi is our cheapest grocery store and the pride of the Midwest. (Chiefs kiss) Its a great way to shop affordabily. I dont advice living off wilson, its not the best area and I personally don't feel comfortable walking around there as a women. Just my take, others may say different. \n\nNext stops on the red line are Jarvis and morse, not horrible areas, but food deserts. You'll have to get back on the train to go buy groceries. Next is Howard. Howard is a red, purple, and yellow stop, and there is a jewel off this stop for food. Downside is Howard isn't a great area. If you see apartments off Juneway please don't put here there. Yes they are cheaper, but there are pretty frequent issues in that spot and I do not advice it. \n\nNext area is the purple line. Purple line is the suburb of Evanston. Lovely little area and home to Northwestern University. Housing can be high and low, but normally the area is pretty good due to the money in the area. This adds to her commute time a decent amount, but if she schedules her day around the rush she is golden. (I do this.) Rush runs from like 5:45am-9:15am then once again from 2:30-7:30pm. This line runs all the way to in front of the cdm. \n\nAlso evanston doesn't pay a grocery bag tax and is just a fun little area to play in. \n\nOn the other side, some students do live off the brown line. Im unfamiliar with the areas so I can't offer solid advice. But some areas aren't bad. \n\nOther piece of advice. I'm from the west, we don't do cold like here. I dont think Texas does cold like here either. Which means she has to be cautious how long she is out in the cold. My recommendations as someone who also isn't from the cold. Try and get the grocery stores within a mile walk. That's about 20 or so mins and the train is nice to half less than a mile, but more than 0.2 or she's gonna hear the train all day long. \n\nAlso, if she plans to drive everything charges for parking, just use the train. Its fast and free with our college passes during the academic year.",

            "comment": "I graduated from the film program in 2021. I would absolutely recommend it, as long as money isn't an issue. 160k for college is an astounding amount of money. Unless she'll be receiving help from family, it's a pretty large debt burden to carry, but I'm sure you both already know that. I had the benefit of having the remainder of my bills being paid off by some extremely generous family members. Otherwise I wouldn't have been able to go. So just know that I'm biased.\n\nBut yeah, I loved the school. I just got off LinkedIn sort of seeing where people ended up, and hopefully I can ease any concerns you or her may have about actually landing a role after college: as long as you really commit yourself while in college and take advantage of the many resources and connections you make, you'll be totally fine and do awesome things in and after college, and likely end up at some really cool places. There's a big market in Chicago that is extremely sustainable for many fields. If Chicago, or the midwest, or even LA/NYC is where she wants to end up, then I think it would be beneficial to immerse yourself in this environment. For one, if you choose to go to Austin, but don't really want to stay there, then many contacts you make will be less important because many will stay in Austin, likely. In Chicago, a good amount of my peers are working for big agencies here, and there's a good amount who have gone to NYC and LA as well, so I feel like I have good connections between here and the coasts. That's a strategic career move that I only realized after the fact. I'm glad I didn't go to a school in my home city where I would've had to move from anyways.\n\nThere's many specializations, so you can definitely find something you're really into. I started as a BA Film &amp; Television major, then switched to BFA with a concentration in Directing. There's editing, VFX, cinematography, production design, screenwriting, comedy writing, etc., and the program is pretty flexible so I was able to incorporate a lot of VFX, motion graphics, and animation skills. Post college, I have been a motion graphics animator in sports. Just because you go to film school doesn't mean you have to do the traditional \"Hollywood\" thing. There's careers for film students everywhere, you'll just have to make sure to specialize and find what you really enjoy doing in a reasonable time so you are prepared for the job search after college with a good portfolio. Get involved from day 1. Meet as many people as you can.",

AFAIK, various STEM majors might go through that, but still nothing close to what you see at large public schools. All of my major and even gen ed classes were probably 15-20 people on average if I had to guess. I'm trying to think of even one class that I had with a larger class size, but I can't.

Have you received your financial aid letter from DePaul yet? I\u2019m hoping it makes up the difference for us- maybe it will for you too? \n\nAs a parent with a lot of my own student debt, graduating debt-free is huge. But if your daughter is like mine- Chicago, DePaul\u2019s highly ranked film program and wanting to move away from home are going to be very enticing.",

DePaul is a fantastic option, and I know she'll love it when we visit later this month, but an additional $50K over four years will take some convincing on her part, especially considering that UT Austin is a higher rated program. No decision has been made, however. We want her to go where she'll thrive.",

            "comment": "Hello there! I graduated from DePaul\u2019s film program in 2020. I\u2019m sure a lot of people have already answered some of your questions here, but I\u2019m happy to give my 2 cents. \n\nI highly recommend the program personally. All the film classes you take you learn a lot from, and nearly every professor there is very passionate about what they do. The class environments are all pretty small too, no more than 20-30 kids a class. But what I loved most about DePaul\u2019s film program is for a few reasons: the variety of classes they have (there\u2019s a class for nearly every aspect of filmmaking, probably even more now since I\u2019ve graduated), the hands on experience you receive, and the access, freedom, and resources each student is given from day one of film school when it comes to making their films. DePaul faculty actually encourage their students to make as much as they can in and outside of class. And the resources and equipment they have are top of the line. They\u2019re always striving to have the latest and most state of the art equipment out there. The film school has been growing significantly in the last decade as well. It\u2019ll be up there with the likes of NYU and USC in probably less than a decade based on their track record. I personally was a BFA with a concentration in editing. And DePaul provided me with a very strong post production background before I graduated. \n\nMost film students take classes in the loop and cinespace (cinespace is where all the film production classes are, so you\u2019ll be learning while on set of one of their sound stages) \n\nIt\u2019s pretty easy to get around on the CTA. Take the city train and you\u2019ll pick it up in no time. And yes it is a commuter school, not at all like a traditional college town setting. But it is in the city so there will be so much to do and see. \n\nMake friends in class, work on student films both in and out of class (especially outside of class, there\u2019s so many going on all the time). Those people will be your industry connections and will potentially help you get a job and start off your career. Same goes for your professors. Outside of your skills and experience, your network and reputation are the key factors in getting a job and growing in your career. \n\nIf your daughter is looking to stay in chicago, there are plenty of opportunities. Advertising is probably the biggest market here for film production, (tons of commercials being shot all the time) outside of the TV shows being shot here thanks to cinespace. \n\nHope this helps!",

            "comment": "DePaul is not at all a typical university experience like it would be at UT.  My son attends the CDM school and seems like the young adults are pretty top notch.  They care about school and want to do well.  Class sizes are smaller. The teachers are terrific with a ton of real-world experience.  It is a teaching university and not a research based one which is a big difference.  Chicago is cold, but awesome.  If your kid is adventurous, creative, unique, and wants to be around a diverse scene then I think it would be a very good choice.  I believe it to be much better than any large state university experience.  Certainly not for everyone though and it is not your typical university experience.  My son really enjoys the school and the program he is in.",

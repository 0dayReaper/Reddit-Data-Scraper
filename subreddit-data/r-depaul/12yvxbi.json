            "comment": "That's likely going to be a tough set of classes - not impossible, but tough.  IMHO CSC 321 (and CSC 347) is/are among the hardest classes I've taken, but also incredibly informative (if you can devote time to studying).  \n\nCSC 321 is difficult because you're practically doing a paper &amp; pencil coding interview for Kanj's exams (he'll be teaching the class in the fall).  I think Kanj is a good professor, and he does give partial credit (as well as curves his exams), so that helps, but doing a pencil &amp; paper exam designing algorithms will be more challenging that you're likely used to.\n\nCSC 373 will depend on who you have as your professor.  I had Karen Heart, and while her class is practically impossible to get a bad grade in, you really need to do her assigned readings and (ungraded) homework to transition smoothly into CSC 374.\n\nCSC 355 with Schwabe is more challenging, but doable.  Schwabe is one of the better educators I've had while at DePaul; however, he's *incredibly* paranoid about cheating.  He's also very nitpicky about grades; I never got a 100% on any of his assignments - even if my SQL met all of his requirements and obtained the correct output.  He also did paper exams as well (although he did allow us to bring a cheat sheet to the final).  I learned so much from his class that I pretty much coasted through CSC 352 when I took it the quarter after CSC 355.\n\nAlso, on a side note, CSC 343 hasn't been offered at DePaul for like 10 years.  The same professor who teaches CSC 347 has made a new class, CSC 363, that will fulfill the same credit requirement.  I'm currently in the class right now, which is on the Rust programming language, and I'm enjoying it quite a bit.  It's a nice contrast to CSC 347.",

I\u2019m taking 4 CS classes at once next fall and am wondering if CSC 363 would be less work than 376 (I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll both be a lot) since 4 CS classes is gonna be rough. Also learning rust in a course seems muuuuuuuch more interesting than distributed systems",

I don't think her class is hard, but I believe that's mostly because I have a solid understanding of threads and sockets from systems II. Professor heart just gives you very basic use case examples and expects you to infer how to apply those examples to the assignments. I've noticed a chunk of students are struggling mostly because they don't really understand threads and sockets. The other professor, from what I heard, uses lockdown browser (not prof joe, but the other professor teaching it this quarter), but I don't know how difficult his section is.",

The only graded work in 363 is a midterm (we haven't taken it yet, but it's an individual programming assignment you have like a day or two to work on), and a final project. We don't really have too much information about either, so I'm hoping that it's not too harsh.\n\n376 is pretty straightforward. Professor heart opens up everything (except the final) for you to complete when the class starts, and she only has soft due dates for everything. I've watched all her lectures, completed all the quizzes, and only have her final assignment &amp; final exam left, so I'm pretty much done with her class and can focus on my other classes. Although her last assignment is currently hanging me up.\n\nAlthough I'm enjoying learning rust and we haven't had any assignments, I'd probably say heart's 376 is easier. More of a better the devil you know than the devil you don't kind of thing.",

I saw her reviews on RMP but had to take her for CSC373 and was pleasantly surprised.  I appreciate that she only has soft due dates for everything (except the final), and she allows you to submit the assignments as many times as you like - even after the assignment has been graded by the grader - and she'll give you the highest grade you can get.  Additionally, she opens up everything for you to do right away, so if you're highly motivated you can pretty much complete the entire class (sans final) in a handful of weeks vs an entire quarter.  Additionally, I think that she tries to hold a class that fosters learning, since a lot of learning is accomplished through failure and repeatedly attempting the problem(s).  \n\n**However**, I think many of her criticisms on RMP are valid.  She just uses basic examples and has pre-recorded lectures to teach the content.  She doesn't try to trick you, but if you had a hard time learning threads and sockets in CSC374, then you'll likely have a difficult time in CSC376.  I'd recommend her if you're capable of staying motivated to watch the lectures and can teach yourself stuff that isn't included in her lectures.  If you're the type who likes a traditional classroom experience, then I wouldn't recommend her.  There's a lot of student who put off doing her assignments and quizzes because they can, and while I wouldn't necessarily say that her assignments are the most difficult I've experienced, they can be challenging.",

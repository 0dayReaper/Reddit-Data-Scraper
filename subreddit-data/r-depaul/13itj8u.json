There's not really much you can do to prepare tbh. Its hard to not overthink it, but as long you are open to new things you will be ready for whatever comes your way",

Also, by interacting with them u will share ur experience, worries nd all with them and you will see that most of us have the same worries. \n\nAlso, i will advice you to have an insight view on the major ur going to do to be sure and not completely lost.",

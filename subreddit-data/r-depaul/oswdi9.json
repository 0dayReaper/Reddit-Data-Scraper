    "postText": "Students who have not submitted proof of COVID vaccination will receive/have received an email about the new requirements. Students will have to submit proof or complete an exemption waiver by August 20th (August 14th for Law). Failure to submit by the deadline will result in students being dropped from fall quarter courses.\n\nSimilarly, all faculty and staff will now be required to submit proof of vaccination or an exemption waiver by September 3rd (August 23rd for Law). People who receive medical or religious exemptions will be expected to test twice a week and DePaul will ask for those results at random. There is no mention at this time what the penalty will be for people who refuse to get a vaccine.\n\nIf you are a student who has not gotten a vaccine, you'll have to schedule yours right away in order to be fully vaccinated in time for the deadline. Don't put it off.",

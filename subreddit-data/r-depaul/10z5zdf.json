But I\u2019d imagine the chances of someone not going aren\u2019t high, although it\u2019s possible.\n\nIf you want to work in LA for a few months, you can still make that happen though - And considering how expensive LAQ is already, you\u2019d be part way to paying for it. \n\nI did LA quarter, and I liked the experience (I still live there) - But it\u2019s really just a glorified 3 months in LA, doing it via DePaul was nice, but they don\u2019t do a lot to help placing you into an internship, so you could definitely do it yourself.",

I still think things could have turned out differently had I gotten it but I was never a favorite because I couldn\u2019t stay in the summer for Project Blue Light. \n\nI do hope you get it! Best of luck to you!",

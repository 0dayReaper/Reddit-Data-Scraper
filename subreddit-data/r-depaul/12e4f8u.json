            "comment": "Im not a CyberSec major but in my experience placement tests don't do jack shit if you do bad on them or do average on them.  The only thing that can realistically happen is that you pass with flying colors and during your class selection appointment with your academic advisor in the summer they allow you to skip like an intro class or two. This happened to me with CSC 241 and CSC 242, she said I can take 243 instead, but I took the lower level classes regardless. Why? You may think you know stuff from highschool, but there could be lapses in your knowledge and things they teach in the intro classes that you might miss out on. That's why I just take the curriculum as they laid it out.",

            "comment": "Hi! \nSo the higher you get the less classes you need to do. So for example, eventually you'll have to take MAT 140. Not a big deal but you can either place MAT 130 or above so that you can take mat 140 immediately. In order to get to this if you place low MAT 101 Algebra MAT 120 Excel math, MAT 130 functions and mathematical models, then MAT 140 discrete math. Each of these take 1 quarter to complete so start early in you place low. If you place to 130 then you really only have like 1-2 math classes you'll need.",

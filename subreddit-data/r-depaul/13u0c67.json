    "postText": "Just got my financial aid package and it's a rocking 30k/yr.\n\nWondering if I could get a appeal to go through that would reduce it a lot. Plan to list that my fam recently went through a house fire + were financially unstable because of covid + multiple family medical emergencies. Would that help convince them to give more financial aid or should I just pucker up and go to a different school? Honestly can't do more than 10k/yr. Bumper if nothing works out but at least I tried! Thanks for any help.",

It is true that, as a private university, DePaul has no legal obligation to uphold freedom of expression. They are, however, legally bound to uphold the contracts they agree to. DePaul stipulated to both the College Republicans and Yiannopoulos that security would be provided for the purposes of maintaining order, guaranteeing safety, and allowing the presentation to proceed in its entirety: not only did they fail to uphold this agreement, but it appears some in the administration actively conspired to sabotage it.\nSo you're right, DePaul isn't guilty of criminal suppression of speech, only criminal breach of contract.",

The government has to make sure the laws are respected, so the citizens can express their views while not fearing for their lives. Police does not enforce the laws against those rioters and thugs because of the political pressure. They would enforce those laws in a heartbeat if it was me trying to shut down BLM event and put me in jail - rightly so. But I expect the standard to be applied evenly and not in a discriminatory manner.\n\n&gt; If you feel they were, contrary to any law, and want to leave the country because of it, by all means, do so.

It's a good point to make I think because it highlights that a) slavery is over and b) while discrimination still exists it's not strong enough to stop a black guy becoming president. That quite clearly shows that while many issues still exist, they are not necessarily pressing enough issues to warrant assaulting guest speakers that other students have paid to hear.  \n\n&gt;I mean, it's their right to do so. I really don't know what to say other than deal with it. People will disagree with you and if they can, they will talk louder. That's life. Not your safe space.   \n\nThey have a moral and legal right to the room. They hired the room, the university said they needed additional security, they paid for the extra security. They have every right to have their own event and have people who they wish to be removed from the event removed. Assault is a big deal by the way, because it's illegal.  \n\n&gt;No one was \"assaulted\". You sound like some SJW crying rape because someone catcalled her on the street. Don't be so whiny/over-dramatic. Again, this is life, not your safe space.  \n\nPlease read up on the Illinois definition of assault. Milo was assaulted. So were other people at the event. Your complete ignorance of the law doesn't help your case. I am not even a resident or a US citizen and it took me all of five seconds to look up the Illinois law and see that it's worded in a similar way to assault laws all around the world.  \n\nYou don't seem to have anything in proportion. Yes there are issues to do with racial politics that need to be addressed, and indeed might have been addressed if people hadn't shut down the event, but they are simply not of a magnitude that allows you to go onto a stage and ruin someone else's event when they have paid for the room and booked it. On top of that the good pastor threatening to hit Milo, and the other protestor balling her fist and swinging it at his face are assault and intimidation.  \n\nYou are a nutcase if you think a public policy disagreement permits anyone to throw a tantrum and assault people, but given your username your opinions are not altogether surprising.\n\n\n ",

They hired the room, the university said they needed additional security, they paid for the extra security. They have every right to have their own event and have people who they wish to be removed from the event removed.\n\nThe students who disrupted the event were on the list of attendees. They followed the proper procedure as everyone else to reserve a seat in that room, which their tuition dollars paid for as much as any other student's. And on the point about having people removed, if that *was* possible, why weren't they? Because no one was violating any laws or university policy. It's as simple as that.\n\nYou're whole following argument is completely obnoxious. \"Someone yelled in his face he was assaulted!!1\" Seriously, go back to your safe space if that triggers you so much. \n\n&gt;On top of that the good pastor threatening to hit Milo, and the other protestor balling her fist and swinging it at his face are assault and intimidation. Do you *really* believe that yelling in someone's face and raising your fist is assault? Because I know some SJW extremists who wouldn't even go that far. Sorry but that is some pussy shit, no other way to say it.\n\nSo someone allegedly \"threatened\" Milo? I saw a woman who was *actually* assaulted, as in physically harmed, outside of the event. 20 CPD officers standing there, not one of them did a thing except move their bikes to protect the kid who stuck the woman. Don't cry about Milo being assaulted like some SJW cuck.\n\nBut ultimately, and this is the real gist of it, you, me, and every other person with common sense knows what Milo's whole deal is. It's not some big secret. He baits reactions. He is great at it, no doubt, but that's all he does. That's why he was invited to campus. If he wasn't going to trigger a bunch of liberals and cause an uproar, there would be no reason to host him. He doesn't say anything of substance that further contributes to the discourse of any ideology. The attendees already share his views. He wasn't adding anything new, he didn't bring a different perspective to the public discourse. His publications and videos are all over the internet, it's easily accessible and demonstrates a repetition of the same shtick. Let's stop pretending he was seeking an actual dialogue, *especially* considering there wasn't anyone with an opposing viewpoint invited to share the stage. He's welcome to do his whole thing, I get it and I see how well he does it, but please stop pretending like he has some higher moral agenda. At least Donald Trump has a cause and a reason to say what he says. I respect that. Milo is just an attention whore who likes stirring the pot. It's cute, but not respectable. ",

What a disgrace, it's an organised event where they had to pay extra for security and both security and police did nothing despite assault (which doesn't require touching), microphones being stolen and the event being deliberately disrupted.  \n\nProtesting is one thing but shutting down the free speech of others is not. This is literally letting physical intimidation prevail over debate, it's cowardice at its worst.",

Great universities are places of learning, and particularly when it's put up online it helps to establish their reputations which are key to future growth and prestige. I probably go to about three or four websites of universities I haven't attended a week to catch up on some research news or some public lecture. I would have liked to have watched Milo speak and had he been able to, even if I disagreed with what he said, it would have enhanced DePaul's reputation in my mind as a serious place where people have serious and difficult discussions.  \n\nIt seems quite obvious that the security and police did nothing because the administration wanted nothing done, which suggests DePaul is a shitty \"daycare &amp; tantrums\" university and not a proper university. How embarrassing for the adult students of many races and ethnicities who paid for this event, and the extra security, to have it interrupted by fascists using physical intimidation and for their own university to betray them and not provide them with what they paid for.",

You are aware that it's one of the key types of events in establishing the reputation of a university? Here in the UK the Oxford Union is world-famous for hosting public debates on difficult topics.

There was a lot of violence and actual threats, along with a school executive stepping down. DePaul's controversy stems from a fucking Milo interview being stopped. I mean come on, I thought americans we're infamous for blowing everything out of proportion? Are you sure you're a brit? \n\nI'm embarrassed by the protests and the way school held things.

Sorry if you think he should \"man up\" but that's assault and intimidation. The microphone was also stolen.  \n\nThis is *after* they had to pay extra for security, that ended up not doing their job, another indication that republicans won't want to go to the institution. The college president also issued a bare minimum apology which attacked Milo and actually falsely suggested he believes things which apparently he does not.  \n\nThe behaviour of the protesters as well as being illegal assault was also against the DePaul rules which specifically are against some of the actions they took. The president also said he was disgusted by them, although apparently not disgusted enough to take disciplinary action.  \n\nThese things are just as bad as Mizzou. Look at the *huge* number of people attacking the university on its Facebook reviews. Read a few, these are not some Internet trolls these are people putting their real names beside very, very angry posts.  \n\nPeople think /r/the_donald is unrepresentative, in memes it is but in ideology it's not. After all Trump won the republican primary with a record number of independents coming in on the open primaries and nationally he's neck-and-neck with Clinton. A *huge* number of people are totally sick and tired of the censorious and hateful nature of the way liberals try to shut down debate. University campuses are like North Korea in ideological conformity, people are sick of it, and now that the left is trying to use violence people aren't going to put up with it any more.  \n\nI am sick of it myself in my own country. There's legitimate protest and then there are screaming mobs trying to bully and intimidate over fairly banal domestic policy disagreements. Transgender bathrooms is not a major issue, yes it's an issue but it's not an issue you can be screaming and spit in people's faces over. Racial politics in the USA still has things that need addressing but slavery is over and a black guy, from a community that's only 16% of the population remember not 50%, is president. People can still be passionate about the issues, they can protest them even but the issues are not big enough to warrant this crazy screaming and assaulting kind of protest.  \n\nIf crazy, screaming and assaulting type things are going to be done to half the population who are going to vote Trump, and DePaul is not going to address them then DePaul is effectively a country club for the radical left. Why would anyone from the the non-left half want to send their kids to such an intolerant shithole? Also, even on the left, why would moderate left people want their kids to be an indoctrinated by a radical left education?  \n\nSo screw DePaul and its weak PC-president. If assault charges aren't filed against those nutters they should have disciplinary proceedings leveled against them for breaking the student rules. On top of that it should be made clear that in further disturbances like these the security and police will be told to act and remove the relevant persons. Until that time there are far better colleges for republicans to send their children to that don't involve having them go to a place where the security and police are not going to protect them because of their, absolutely mainstream, ideology. It's just sickening that anyone is every trying to make excuses for this.  \n\nYes, let's see in 6 months what happens to DePaul enrollments. Maybe it will not be as big as Mizzou, but my bet is it's going to be a hit because people are just sick and tired of this complete double standards shit. And it's not a radical position, I am saying there are still issues and BLM are welcome to protest, all people are saying is they want equality under the rules and law. It's quite obvious what would happen if some white dude bust into a BLM meeting on the campus and started snatching microphones off people and started pacing around menacingly and then threatening people when they made fun of him. Fuck everything about these shitty protesters and DePaul's shitty response. What a pathetic institution.",

You'd be surprised at how many people go to DePaul because of how liberal it is. They pretty much brag about it and jam it in your face from the second you show up there. That's basically my main argument, is that people at DePaul aren't surprised about this and it doesn't change DePauls reputation enough like it did at Mizzou\n\nMizzou was in a very conservative area and it lost its conservative crowd. DePaul has a large and specific demographic of liberal-minded students that are actually probably excited about this type of behavior.\n\nDePaul was never that impressive of a degree anyway, but a weak response from the President, and a YouTube video of Milo protestors won't stray liberals away, and won't cause any reasonable employer to scrap qualified employees that come from the school.

Illinois voted 4/10 Romney in 2012 and Catholics voted 5/10 Republican in 2012, white Catholics as a group within Catholics voted 6/10 Republican. So while Mizzou has a slightly more Republican base I'd guess there are a quite a few republicans at DePaul they probably just don't speak up much.  \n\nAlmost all colleges are liberal but when it trends into overt and high profile discrimination and assault I think you are going to see people avoiding it. There are lots of alternatives and people pay too much for college these days so they are going to be sensitive to negative high profile events that suggest they are unwelcome. I think only an idiot is going to hand over tens of thousands to an institution that despises people like them that much when there are other clear alternatives. Even if the effect is half that of Mizzou it will be pretty substantial.  \n\n",

If I lived in China or even Russia, or any totalitarian country, maybe I could understand some of these illegal injunctions. Maybe I could understand the denial of certain basic First Amendment privileges, because they haven\u2019t committed themselves to that over there. But somewhere I read of the freedom of assembly. Somewhere I read of the freedom of speech. Somewhere I read of the freedom of press. Somewhere I read that the greatness of America is the right to protest for right. And so just as I say we aren\u2019t going to let any dogs or water hoses turn us around, we aren\u2019t going to let any injunction turn us around.\" - Dr. Martin Luther King Junior\n\nfrom his *I've Been to the Mountaintop* speech\n",

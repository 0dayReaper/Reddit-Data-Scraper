    "postText": "hi! i am transferring as a junior to depaul and i am thinking about on-campus housing since i want to make sure i can meet new people and connect. i am leaning towards the apartments but haven't heard much about them. i also cant find much online. i am majoring in film so i wanted to be closer to the fullerton station. i looked into centennial but worried it would be too loud since it's right next to the L. or even the sanctuary or sheffield? if anyone has any tips or advice, that would be greatly appreciated! :)",

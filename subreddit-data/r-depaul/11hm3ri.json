Its called the Golden apple diner. Im not 100% but I believe its within the zoning distance that you might be able to have published safety drive you.",

If you're someone who listed to the radio as a kid, they play the radio and you get to listen to Delilah. No worries if you don't know what that is, just for me it was very symbolic and relaxing, maybe it will be for you too.",

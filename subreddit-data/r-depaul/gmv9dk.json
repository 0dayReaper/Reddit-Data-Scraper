    "postText": "Freshman girl here. I had a male friend tell me he saw \"my\" tinder profile but I don't have one. I also have no social media and have never posted pictures or other information about myself. He sent me a screenshot of the profile and the only picture there was is the one used on d2l. Due to classes being online, most of my profs required me to have a picture on d2l. This is the only photo I've had of myself online before. I don't know what to do about it. I'm an international student and am only 16. The fake profile was advertising hook ups and listed the building that I was in. My male friend said he swiped right on me but he didn't match with the fake profile. I don't know whether this situation is completely out of my control or not. But someone in one of my classes used my school picture to make the profile.",

As you do so, take a screenshot of whatever form you're filling out, and save it in some word document, with the date and time. It's important to have your own record for these things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThird, wait a few days/a week for the gears to move at Tinder. If that doesn't work, then I would consider [reaching out to our title IX](https://offices.depaul.edu/student-affairs/title-ix/Pages/default.aspx) office. That's roughly what they're there for. Show them that document from earlier, show them that you tried to get Tinder to take it down, and they'll take it from there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest of luck, I'm sorry you have to go through this.",

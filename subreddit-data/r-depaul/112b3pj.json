    "postText": "Hi everyone! I was recently accepted to DePaul as a transfer student and was awarded some scholarships. Although I would love to go to DePaul, the money I received does not make the school a feasible option. I was wondering if I completed an appeal form, such as the cost of attendance or special circumstance form, would it help me to obtain more scholarships? Or will it just help me get more general aid like loans? I appreciate any recs you guys may have! :)",

            "comment": "There is an appeal form you can fill out to request more money from the school in the form of scholarship, I think it\u2019s the Special Circumstance Appeal https://www.depaul.edu/admission-and-aid/financial-aid/forms/Pages/appeal.aspx\n\nGenerally speaking, these appeals are for people who have some sort of financial hardships in their lives and it does require documentation. I filed one last year and was approved, but admittedly I don\u2019t know much about the entire thing. I would speak with DePaul Central if you can! Their information can be found here: https://offices.depaul.edu/depaul-central/Pages/default.aspx",

I think it took about a couple weeks to hear back, but I was also a student already at the university when I filed it so I don\u2019t know if that had any part in it or not. But it\u2019s a fairly simple process, in my opinion",

And DePaul\u2019s new president genuinely wants to work on making the university more financially accessible.\n\nWhen appealing, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to tell them where DePaul stands in terms of real cost of attendance after aid compared to other schools you\u2019re considering. That gives them a target to try to equal or beat.",

I am considering switching to software development as it has always been something I\u2019ve been interested in, particularly game dev. Has anyone completed this degree and if so what was your experience like? I would also love to hear about any experiences you\u2019ve had if you have completed the MS in HCI as well. Thank you!",

            "comment": "Not HCI/Software Dev, but I did my Masters in CS, expecting to focus on real-time systems/game dev. Working full-time and doing 2 classes a quarter, I couldn't manage the intro classes in that track. Keenan knows his stuff, and it's probably the class (Optimized C++) I've learned the most in overall, but the time expected/required was just unrealistic with me also working. I wound up dropping Game Engine 1 and Real Time Multithreaded Architecture with him because of that, and pivoted into the AI concentration",

It\u2019ll use my elective credits but that\u2019s good cuz I have to get those anyway. Does anyone have any recommendations for classes that were fun and entertaining?",

The only big assignments are a group presentation (to show the Chinese history part, it was pretty easy there's a lot to go off of lol), and a 3-4 page essay I believe of what u learned in the class and what history u learned as the final. An easy class to pass all in all! (I will say though you have to buy equipment for the class, so just keep that in mind)",

New start times are as follows:\n\nXavier - 12:30 PM\n\nButler - 1:00 PM\n\nAdditionally, the lower level concourse of the Loop University Center, adjacent to the eSports center will be open for  watching the team play live. If you are a resident of the University Center, live downtown, or simply are willing to travel to the loop campus then please attend the matches live and show your support. The more support attained, the easier it will be for DePaul to develop its school's eSports!",

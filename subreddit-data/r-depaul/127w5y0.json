Have you considered dropping out? *Have* you dropped out because of it?\n\nWhat has your experience been dealing with money as a college student?\n\nAnything you would like to share would be much appreciated. Thanks everyone!",

            "comment": "I was in a bad place in undergrad, no parental help, but parents made too much money for much financial aid. I worked full time at minimum wage jobs because that worked with my college schedule (nights and weekends) and lived 30 minutes from campus in a trap apartment with some people I hated. I am so very lucky my car didn't break down (aside from cracked radiator) in that time. \n\nI was really poor and never slept, but I never considered dropping out because A) I didn't really have skills that would let me make more than minimum wage \nB) I would have to pay student loans on top of everything else without any increase in income\nC) I was absolutely miserable and determined to get out of that situation. \n\nBy my senior year it was better, I started working internships that paid $15-20 an hour,  now I make 6 figures 3 years out of college and am in grad school.\n\nThe funny thing is, gradschool somehow feels harder than what I went through in undergrad. I'm financially comfortable but I am exhausted now. I can't push myself like I did in undergrad. I'm technically working more hours than I did in undergrad, and fewer course hours, but it's just harder.\n\nEdit: I have considered dropping out of gradschool a lot just because I have had a hard time balancing the workload and a full-time job. By the end of a quarter I am absolutely burnt out. I have 5 classes to go including this quarter.",

But I know if I did drop out I would not only be stuck with this debt and no feasible way to pay it off. So I have to stick with this no matter how tired I am and keep trying. Like I work 4 campus jobs to make rent! But I have another two years after this and I can't quit no matter how stressed, tired, or poor I get. If I quit its for nothing and ill be even more screwed.",

The school admins and many full time professors and staff who are staying on (or hoping to stay on) are imploring the rest of us to keep these changes quiet because they don\u2019t want to create a panic and a dip in enrollment. The school is purposely obfuscating the issues so it seems like less of a big deal than it is. \n\nI am very sorry for the current students, but I also think incoming students and students considering applying should know that the school admins are not taking any steps to live up to their marketing claims that DePaul is a student-centered institution. They are a tuition-centered. They do not care about the quality of your education or your professors\u2019 abilities to give you the attention you deserve. They only care about holding onto their own 6 figure salaries. \n\nCome to DePaul if you and your family can afford it, but I implore the rest of you to look into schools such as UIC or Northeastern. Or at least consider taking some of your Gen Eds at the community colleges (many of the adjuncts who work at DePaul also teach close-to-the-same class at community colleges). \n\nIf you are a prospective student, know that the admins, current professors, and current students are going to have a vested interest in downplaying the issues at DePaul. Their jobs and the perceived value of their very expensive degrees depend on holding up the party line that the school is committed to \u201cVincentian personalism.\u201d Even people like me, who are leaving, are not going to be very publicly forthcoming because we need decent letters of reference and don\u2019t want to be branded as troublemakers.",

                    "comment": "Wow, I REALLY appreciate your honesty here. This is rare to hear from a professor and is refreshing, albeit frustrating and sad. I am an older student who is trying to finally get my bachelors degree after trying out two other schools over the years, and the tuition is just crushing me. I have to figure out how to work and afford life while also doing school because obviously I have no parental financial contribution like the younger students. I am highly considering transferring to Full Sail University where I would get extremely close to a full ride scholarship and everything else would be covered by federal financial aid.\n\nDePaul has been great for me so far, but sometimes I do question whether it is worth the price tag. Sometimes I feel like I haven\u2019t learned as much as I should have by this point. I feel like I\u2019ve been giving a lot of time to gen-eds but not an equal or greater value back from my major classes.\n\nWhat you said makes sense. It isn\u2019t surprising to me that many professors are teaching similar classes at community colleges.\n\nThis is a DePaul issue, but also a general issue with all higher education. I only wish DePaul, being the so-called \u201cVincentian value\u201d school that they say they are, would take a different stance and help students out more than other schools.\n\nThanks for the reply, it was great to hear.",

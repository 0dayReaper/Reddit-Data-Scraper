    "postText": "Thinking about living at the dorms for a quarter, is there a way to get affordable meals around the campus without paying massive fees? just wanna cover for 1 quarter only and the rates are insane. I was thinking if there's a way to contact someone with unlimited meals if they aren't living on campus anymore and pay 1/3 of the price. Is this even allowed?",

            "comment": "No its not allowed. Because your meal pass is stored on your student ID, so you won't be able to purchase someone else's meal plan. Also, if it's to high for the quarter, just pay in cash. It breaks down to almost the same amount",

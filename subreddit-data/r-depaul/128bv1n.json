    "postText": "Some of you may not be aware that DePaul is projected to have a huge budgetary shortfall.  Administrators are being pretty secretive about the numbers and plans to resolve the shortfall. As a result they are planning budget cuts. Some of these include cutting classes and cutting staff. Administrators have made it clear that they are planning to fire lots of adjunct instructors.\n\nStudents may not be aware that adjunct instructors teach roughly half of the classes at DePaul and other institutions. They are paid $4200 per class and may teach a maximum of 5 classes per year. This is full time commitment for which they are payed $21,000 per year. \n\nSo the university relies on these folks for half the work load, pays them barely minimum wage and cuts their jobs at the slightest inconvenience.  Some of these people are your favorite professors. They are struggling to make ends meet, and they are going to be unceremoniously fired.",

We actually just hired two new adjunct faculty members as well so uh, shit.\n\nDoes anyone know if there\u2019s anything that can be done to \u201cprotest\u201d this kind of thing? I don\u2019t really know if there even is anything, but if there\u2019s even just a name of someone to contact that\u2019d be wonderful",

    "postText": "Like many of you, during my time at DePaul so far, Brankos has fed me a few times. If you don\u2019t know, Brankos is a family-run restaurant across the street from the Lincoln Park campus. All their food is truly fantastic. Brankos is located at 1118 W Fullerton Ave. The woman who works behind the counter couldn\u2019t be nicer and has been feeding students like us for a very long time. I had recently heard they closed due to the pandemic. Thankfully, I think I am wrong. I walked by today and saw the lights on inside. I know some of us may not be on campus but, if you are or want to order some takeout, I hope you wouldn\u2019t consider Brankos. It\u2019s been an integral part of the DePaul community for some time, and we can\u2019t let it die! \n[Brankos](https://m.yelp.com/biz/brankos-sandwich-shop-chicago) (I don\u2019t know how the link thing works so i don\u2019t know what the picture is i just tired linking the yelp)",

I was eventually able to pay her back. I went back ten years later and she remembered me. She is a genuinely kind woman who cares about the students. I really hope she can stay open.",

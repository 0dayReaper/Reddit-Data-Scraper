Does it affect the students? Faculty? Student resources? Increase in tuition? What's the cause of this budget gap?",

They have laid off a handful of teachers already from smaller programs in LAS, cut research projects from CSH, and im sure there are other cuts expected to close the gap. \n\nUnfortunately we don't know how this will effect students. Especially not until we get our aid packages in mid to late summer. So right its a waiting game until end of summer and fall to see how screwed we really are.",

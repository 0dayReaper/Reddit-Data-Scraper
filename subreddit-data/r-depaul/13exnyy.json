The nice thing is you can put the buildings into Google maps and get walking directions but once you've been to a building once or twice you should remember where it is fairly easily. Just give yourself plenty of time to find each class for the first couple weeks until you get used to it!",

The loop has less buildings but a ton of classrooms. Lincoln Park is a bit more spread out, but I had no problem finding classes in each building. After a week or two, it seemed really not a huge deal, especially with the campus map depaul has on its website. \n\nGood luck!",

                            "comment": "Thats totally fine! So with that major set the buildings you need to know about in Lincoln Park (lpc) are Arts and Letters. Its on Kenmore, has a patio area, is a 4 story building, was styled by the dude who made Barnes and noble. Very easy to find as there is large metal sign right next to the front door. Directly across the street from it is Levan (pronounced La von), when you walk inside this building you will see four elevators, two on each side. They both go up 5 or 6 floors (I can't remember which). The left side of the building is McConnell. McConnell used to be the old science building, most students don't have classes there, and mainly housed to the multicultural offices on the 3rd floor. Levan on the right side host a lot of classes. Especially if you do any hybrid classes. Hybrid classes are classes designed to be both in person or you can attend on zoom. They have the set up that works for it unlike arts and letters. Okay so still on floor one directly between the two elevator banks going forward is the Schmitt academic center. Aka the sac. No one uses the full term. Promise. There are two large lecture halls on each side of this hallway and its also lined with lockers. These rooms are normally for science lectures as they sit more than the standard classrooms. Also lockers can be rented through campus connect 20$ first year 10$ every year after. Nice resource to have. If you keep walking straight the sac is also home to the career center on your left before you exit the doors to the quad. And across the room on your right is financial aid. There is a huge cutout/ drop down in the ground with chairs called the pit. The pits a nice little area to chill. The SAC is a 5 floor complex with mainly administrative offices. If you walk towards financial aid then turn to face your right you'll see an elevator bank. 2nd floor is home to the writing center and irl lab 2 (irl labs are craft labs, there sewing machines, 3d printers, paint, woodshop stuff, etc. All free btw.) The 2nd floor is also home to the quantitive reasoning labs. This is the math requirement called LSP 120 or MAT 120 as I believe they were changing the name. There is also a connection between this floor and the 3rd floor or McConnell and Levan. As for any floor up, mostly just academic offices. So modern language, history, study abroad, latino studies, catholic studies, math, etc are all above and a handful more. Unless you need to see them or want to plan a study abroad you'll probably never go there (if you have questions about study abroad hit me up.) Alright back to the first floor next to the career center. If you walk out any of the back doors you'll enter the quad. The quad is surrounded by buildings except in the top and bottom. So left side SAC and slightly below it is the library. The library can be accessed either on Kenmore or the quad, you can't miss the giant gold words. On the other side is McGowan North and McGowan South. These are the science buildings. If you ever decide to torture yourself with bio or chem you'll go here. If no, you'll never enter these buildings ever. Next building. This building is visible from arts and letters garden, the entrance of Levan, or the top of the quad by McGowan north(north? North? We are going with north, its the one closest to the street!) Its the student center. Student center has food and events. On Kenmore you can enter one side of the building on the otherwise there is a big status on sheffield. You can enter there makes no issue either way. These are really the only buildings in lpc you need to know.",

I know you'll need to know the cdm, the cdm is a I wanna say 8 story building and hope to the computer geeks and film students. (All the love, three of my besties are CS majors.) Not hard to navigate, only advice I have that I ask you heed. Don't go in the 7/11s near the cdm. There are two and don't go in. They always get robbed, if you need something walk to target, walk to walgreens, walk anywhere that isn't there. I also recommend you find the DePaul Center. The DePaul Center is essentially the SAC of the loop. Lots of admin offices, library on the top floor, food haul inside, etc. You can't miss it as its marked with the massive logo of Barnes and noble. I dont believe there is much else you'll need to know.",

            "comment": "TL;DR: Sarah Lim, a 17 old DePaul student, spreads misinformation to a vulnerable population by posting legitimate-looking flyers promising luxury accommodations to a homeless community. She's not sorry, since she has no intention of apologizing (claiming it would be too dangerous for a 17 y/o to go there after what she had done), and she even says she's proud that she got the attention that she got (stating that she's proud to have been in a *Tribune* article about it for her age - even if it was a scam). She later on mentions that she wants to run for mayor as a republican.\n\nOf course she wants to run as a republican. She's an egotistical sociopath taking a page out of Ron DeSantis's and Greg Abbott's book by trying to relocate a vulnerable population under false pretenses. She'll fit in with their ranks just fine.\n\nEdit: [Here's a better article from the *Tribune* on the same situation](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-fake-eviction-notices-homeless-20220929-j23ydlvdifeoxne5ef4i2iqbwq-story.html). This article mentions that they're looking into criminal charges against Lim, who unsurprisingly mentions that she thinks the Alderman seeking a criminal investigation should focus on fixing the homeless issue - instead of trying to convict Lim.",

Her tiktok has like 70k followers that she\u2019s obviously botted and she\u2019s reposting popular creators videos to drive traffic.\n\nI hate assuming things but this person is obviously not all there mentally. No one in their right mind would be doing the things she did",

(edit to add- either she's not all there mentally, or she's just bonkers immature)",

Look at Trump, who just recently gave a speech where he said that the Mar-a-lago raid is $5B of free publicly; at a separate event, he was gloating that the biggest crowd of supporters he's ever had was at the 1/6 insurrection at the Capitol. Or DeSantis, who has repeatedly mentioned that he's proud they sent the asylum seekers from Texas up to Martha's Vinyard (by providing them with not just misleading, but downright harmful information), justifying his actions by claiming that they'll be fine now that they're in the most posh sanctuary city in the world.\n\nThey have no concept of morality, and they are indifferent to shame. These people are sick, yet they have droves of rabid followers (Lim apparently has 70k followers on social media, so she has *an* audience). You can't compromise with someone who would gladly watch the world burn if it would give them an extra 15 minutes of fame.",

About 90 percent of kids I knew at DPU had parents that could pay out of pocket. The others were like me or were taking on tons of (imo) silly debt. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it's a great school, but so are plenty others that are far more affordable.\n\nBc of my parent I was able to finish undergrad with only $25k of debt (from my previous school).",

I paid in state bc my parent's gross income was about 13k at the time of my FAFSA. \n\nIt's annoying that at the time I felt like out of state schools gave me better help than in state (I'm from IL). That was a while ago (I'm closer to 30 than I am to 20) so I'm not sure what it's like now. \n\nI was able to only take out federal loans to fund the rest. \n\nDPU will pay full tuition for any dependent under 26 for undergrad and 50 percent off for grad.",

So my parent started there in spring quarter of my freshman year so I couldn't receive this until summer quarter a calendar year later. \n\nUnless they've changed this (would be stupid of them). Employees also receive free tuition for themselves (for grad classes as well). \n\nThe employee is taxed on it as income though, so that sucks.\n\nEdited to add: they are also part of a national coalition of schools that you can get tuition for less at \"sister schools\" that process is more complicated though as you have to apply for the discount. When you attend DePaul it's automatic (though I think the employee has to alert admissions or something, I don't remember that end). I still had to be formally accepted in the normal way though, it's not a pass through to get in.",

                                            "comment": "Yep, \nSo firstly, in fall/ winter quarter of your first year depaul begins offering a scholarship for freshman to apply to. This scholarship is called the vincentian service scholarship. Depaul is a catholic university, specifically vincentian catholic. But you do not have to be catholic to get this. Im not. \n\nAnyway, like it sounds you'll do service and take a small class. In fall quarter of your sophomore year you'll take a small two credit class. Don't worry you pay for 18 credits so it won't set you behind class wise. After you take this class you'll begin a volunteer option. You can work at a food kitchen, tutor kids, help in a community garden, and many other options weekly. Dont worry its only a few hours, but this opportunity is worth $6,000 each year for 3 years. I believe its either 20-40 students get this opportunity but it comes to 18k overall. But you have to apply in your first year, if you miss the deadline then you missed your chance. \n\nNext is a program called Trio. Trio is built up of 3 levels. SSS (for all first gen, low income, or students with a learning disability. They have their own counselors and events), Arnold Mitchell Fellow (AMF) (apply in your freshman year and join in your sophmore. Its a one year program where you will take a 2 credit class on research each quarter. This program also has a few thousand dollar scholarship associated with it and when it ends you'll have a scholarly paper you wrote published. Program does require a compelling interest in grad school, nothing that you have to firmly follow, just an interest.) Last level is McNair. McNair is if you really want to do grad school. You conduct research, you join a cohort, they help pay for the GRE, they help pay for Grad School college visits, have their own special advisors. They get to show off their research yearly. If you join AMF there is a direct pathway into this program. If you don't join AMF you can still join this program, it just has a few more steps. It's great, especially if you know that you're in a field where grad school is required like bio or chem.\n\nNext, not depaul specific but relevant to chicago, new York, Los Angeles, and some other areas of the country is America Needs You (ANY). This program is amazing and I couldn't recommend it more. Its for first generation students and does great work to help you get ready for the professional world. You all apply for this in your freshman year, if you miss it you will not qualify anymore. Alright let's jump in. As a sophmore you'll meet with this program twice a month in the loop on a Saturday. They will feed you breakfast and lunch and host a workshop. Financial literacy, mock interviews, concerns in the work place, types of leaders, etc. They will do their best to get you talking and used to talking. This program also runs on a semester system, so after the first semester you'll submit transcripts and be graded on assignments (these take like 10 mins each workshop, so please don't panic), attendance, and transcripts as their is a gpa requirement. Anyway, all goes well you get a prepaid credit card with 500$ for the semester for professional development. Follow the same rules you'll get the same in the end of the school year. Junior year begins and you only meet once a month. Workshops are more direct and they really start offering the important workshops to gear you to be prepared for the professional world. Again meet the requirement and 500$ each semester. \n\nThere are two other things that exist with each year, one is mock interviews. Normally they're hosted once a month in the evening and take an hour. Its online. Next is you are required to get an internship in the summer. Luckily they are paired with some big companies like PWC, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and many many more. This is really all about networking too. \nI also forgot to mention that in your first year you get a mentor! Normally someone in your field who will stay with you throughout the program and offer you advice.",

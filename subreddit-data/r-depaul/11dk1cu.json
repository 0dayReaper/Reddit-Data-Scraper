    "postText": "So I am a newly admitted student and the financial aid proposal they gave me isnt great since my parents don\u2019t want to pay for anything. And because of that I noticed that depending on the housing dorm i choose the total cost goes up but I also dont want to stay in a bad dorm. Are there like ways to get more money because i am also applying to more scholarships and also are there jobs available on campus? I really want to go to DePaul and this would really help, thank you.",

            "comment": "Firstly, definitely submit an appeal for more aid like below. If you have been accepted to other schools you can also show the aid they have given you and ask if they can offer more. \n\nYou are not required to live on campus as a freshman at depaul. It is cheaper to live off campus, go to the depaul Facebook housing page and ask around. \n\nFor future notice, you can apply to be an rn in the dorms. They live for free in the dorms. Also, dont live in Seton. Its gonna be one of the cheapest and its the worst. Live in Monroe, University, or Centennial.",

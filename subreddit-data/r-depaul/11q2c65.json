How bad could it be!\u201d\n\nNo. Wrong. \n\nYour neighbors WILL run up and down the halls screaming. Your neighbors WILL be loud at all times. I asked my neighbors twice in October to be quiet and one of them tried to fight me physically. Your neighbors will also be throwing parties with the worst music possible. Also, the building is just bad. The walls are paper thin - I can hear everything. Within a week of being here, our kitchen stools just broke. Everything is breaking all the time. Our wifi sucks. Our kitchen island is made of plywood. If you ask the office to do literally anything, they will not do it OR they will give you the incorrect information and when you go to do something (subletting or following up on something) the manager will come in and say \u201cidk who told you that but that\u2019s not a thing here.\u201d Also, their contract literally just protects them from ANYTHING that could happen and leaves you out on your ass. It\u2019s the most one sided thing I have ever seen. \n\nIf you value peace, quiet, your sanity, and your money, do not live at Ion. It is not worth the outrageous price and it is not worth hating your life.",

I live at the UC in the loop and the walls are also paper thin, people blast music at 12 in the morning, people shout and run through the halls like 7 years olds at night, my sink and toilet clogs 24/7, in the mornings sometimes I don\u2019t have cold water. I put in a maintenance request and it took them 4 months to install my new window blinds. It doesn\u2019t matter where you live you\u2019ll deal with bullshit anywhere and quite frankly we probably have it better than most housing options, my brother has to go into someone else\u2019s literal room to shower and doesn\u2019t have ac/heat at sanctuary townhomes. It is what it is.",

Which actually makes for a more social environment, so you meet a lot more people in Corcoran because everyone tends to hang out in the AC. So I wouldn't trade it, personally.",

Plus it's only 1 year anyways.\n\nIf you mean food at the stu, it's good enough to live on. When I was there they started doing the swipe system/buffet style in the main area. A lot of people bring in containers in their backpack to make their money go farther so you don't run out of swipes/money. Food in general in Lincoln Park is great. Not sure if you're from Chicago, but there's so many food options that it's impossible to try them all.",

I live in the suburbs outside of the city so I would commute and take the train or car. UIC and Depaul are giving me the most money. Which school would be best for IT and internships?",

And lots of classwork. It seems very depressing. UIC and DePaul are great options you would be in the loop for both. I hear that UIC is better academically than DePaul but you could easily land a good job after college at either. I cant really say much about the internships but honestly I would think they would have equal opportunities.",

They're not the same, nor are their curriculums even remotely similar. Yes, they are sister schools but they don't share the prestige.  \n\n\n Both campuses are sketchy to say the least though. UIC is very depressing btw. If you enjoy the social aspects of life steer far away because you'll feel like 1 of 100,000 cogs in a machine, accept 90% of the other cogs go home at night and the campus is lifeless.  \n\n\n As for IT and internships you're more likely to find internships at DePaul. I'm a freshman in CS and I already have 2 internship offers matched through the career center. Let me actually rephrase, you can find and internship no matter what school you go to, some might be easier because school connections etc. However it's ultimately up to you as an individual to build your resume and make yourself marketable to employers. It doesn't matter what school you go to, if you don't have any side projects or relevant experience you're not getting an internship. So, while school choice can help it's ultimately up to you.",

Other than that one encounter I haven\u2019t had anything else happen to me, and that encounter wasn\u2019t even that serious compared to what else I\u2019ve heard (public safety got involved before anything serious could really happen but I was still terrified). And even though I\u2019ve seen police and public safety cars rather frequently lately, there were hardly any last year and the previous quarters this year. But there\u2019s enough stories and public safety email alerts to still be cautious when going to the loop, as things are definitely more likely to happen there than on the Lincoln Park campus, but yeah I agree it\u2019s not *that* dangerous overall compared to other areas in Chicago. Just that it can be at times, and more-so than the safest neighborhoods.\n\nIdk much about UIC so I wasn\u2019t even trying to compare the two on what\u2019s more dangerous lol, I was just talking about the loop. So if UIC is more dangerous than the loop probably does seem safer in comparison.",

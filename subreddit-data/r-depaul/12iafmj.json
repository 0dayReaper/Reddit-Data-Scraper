    "postText": "Any MIS grads here that can say how their job search/career is going? I've been hearing from some recent grads at DePaul that MIS majors are struggling to get jobs. Is this true for the majority of people and is this major just a watered down IT? It seemed perfect to me because I don't want to get too deep into accounting or finance, but I enjoy both the business and technical side of things and likely want to go into data analytics. I'm thinking of getting a minor in CS or DS to complement it as well, so if anyone has opinions on that I'd appreciate it.",

Do it if you don\u2019t like to code. That being said, if I could do it over again I would do CS, especially if you want to do something more technical/engineering related. You will have more opportunity and also have all of the job opportunities that an MIS major would have. The only classes I am using in my job are the elective cs classes I took.",

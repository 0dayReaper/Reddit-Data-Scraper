Not only are the classes more challenging, there is a lack of structure that can feel overbearing. Most people I talk to are struggling. Besides, there are the added stresses of a crucial presidential election and a global pandemic. This quarter is fucking horrible. To the people saying that you should get over it, I genuinely don't understand you. This shit is unbearable. Also, if you're prone to mental illness, its worse.",

In fact, I think COVID has made college life at DePaul easier. All our quizzes and tests are now online and most of my professors have given up trying to enforce control and have made them open-book.\n\nI can understand why socially it's difficult, but just get out and hang with friends in your free time at home. I don't see how that makes school itself more challenging.\n\nIf the switch from in-person to virtual suddenly made your motivation levels plummet, maybe you don't care so much about what you're doing in the first place? We're all adults now, just drink a cup of coffee and watch your lecture. It's not that hard.\n\nI know it being online can be distracting as you're on your laptop/desktop, but c'mon, you should have self-control by now.\n\n**EDIT:** Obviously there are some majors where being in-person is crucial to the education (and I sympathize), but if you fall in that category, you should've already foreseen this happening and opted to do gen eds or take some off time.",

And so I shouldn't have assumed that's the case for OP, but I've talked to some of my peers (in my classes), and I just don't understand what's making it so hard for them.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if humans retain information better when engaged with and lectured to in-person rather than virtually, but DePaul's take is understandable given the circumstances.\n\nI would recommend to you and others in your specific situation to take a gap quarter (if at all possible).",

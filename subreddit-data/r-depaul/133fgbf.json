DePaul allows you to make monthly payments, so I have it worked out to about 1k a month. That's still a lot though. \n\nMy personal loan offer wasn't very much. Definitely not worth it. My parents, on the other hand, had much better offers. Instead of going that route, I did the monthly payment plan. So while I have no debt so far, it has been a struggle. \n\nDePaul is crazy expensive, bottom line. Best of luck.",

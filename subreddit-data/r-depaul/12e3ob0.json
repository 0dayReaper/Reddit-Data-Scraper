Could those of you who have taken them please tell me how it is, and how much it impacts placement? Can I use a calculator? How much should I study? Anything is appreciated, thank you all.",

            "comment": "Imo you don't REALLY have to study for the math placement, since it's more placing you in a certain math category, like if you'll be placed in mat 120 or something above. You CAN study though, it'll probably help you get into a higher class ranking, but I wouldn't say it is necessary. There are things on there you might not even have learned yet \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

Next, the only thing that placements determine is if you need to take more or less classes. So don't let it be a major concern. Its more of a, do I need to take more or less math classes or chem classes. Etc",

            "comment": "Hey I\u2019m also an incoming freshman and completed those placement tests. \n\nThe math one is very long but it\u2019s broken down into basic algebra, introductory algebra, intermediate algebra, pre calculus and geometry and each are 45 mins. The basic and intro algebra are pretty easy. If you really want to practice, depaul has a link to their review website with videos and practice problems. \n\nThe chemistry one is pretty short and since I\u2019m taking AP Chem this year that helped. The chem placement test is very much similar to the practice, so keep practicing the practice test. The actual test though might be more wordy and you have to take your time a bit.\n\nIf your a pre-health student then these two matter. Try to do well on them and you can check on their website what class you need to start with for whichever program you\u2019re doing. If you don\u2019t get a passing score they do let you retest but you can only do that once.\n\nHope that helps!",

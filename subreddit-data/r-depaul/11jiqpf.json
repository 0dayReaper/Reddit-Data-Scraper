    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m an incoming freshman for the 2023-2024 school year, and I wanted to start trying to find a roomate! I\u2019m a pretty quiet person, but I\u2019m looking for someone who\u2019s also a musician, and doesn\u2019t mind when I play (I\u2019d love to jam too!) I\u2019m a pretty neat person, and I\u2019m respectful of others space/belongings. I love to listen to music throughout the day, so anyone who loves to play music sounds like a good fit :)\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to meeting new people at DePaul, but if you\u2019re looking for a roommate and I sound like a good fit for you, let me know :)",

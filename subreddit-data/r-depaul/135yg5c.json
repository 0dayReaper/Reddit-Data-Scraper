But both will cost tuition. Most students don\u2019t qualify for part-time financial aid in summer; so, tuition is out of pocket. There are usually a few summer scholarships available for internships (\u2026I believe these are based on need).",

At least with how it works at the CDM, you can\u2019t retroactively get credit for an internship once it\u2019s over. It honestly seems like they do that to make people pay summer tuition (since most internships I\u2019ve seen are over the summer), but also make sure you talk to your academic advisor ASAP because you can\u2019t enroll in the internship class without prior approval",

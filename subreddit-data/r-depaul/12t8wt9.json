    "postText": "Im gonna be honest, depaul was my top choice, since they gave me an amazing scholarship and i love their location, but with the 2 women being attacked on campus, the 56 million gap and the fact that it is a little hard to reach international admission (it took me two weeks to talk to them) i've been starting to doubt that. Is there any chance of them raising tuition a lot or taking the scholarship off? Uic and Loyola also gave me a scholarship and they seem safer/more stable choices, does anyone know the possible consequences of the gap on depaul? I'd love to go there but i'm worried, what would you guys do?",

(I was on campus that day taking a nap on the quad). \n\nAs for school, depauls school in business is extremely well rated. So that's something to consider, but we also don't know how this will effect students until fall.",

Loyola is ranked better overall but DePaul\u2019s business school is way more well connected imo. DePaul business students have beaten my uchicago business friends for internships. Plus it\u2019s closer to downtown and business district than Loyola. UIC is the closest to downtown though. I\u2019d go with DePaul, but then again i\u2019m pretty biased\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

DePaul parties are usually more artsy while Loyola ones are more fratty, at least from my experience. but there are also frat parties here. Live on LPC freshman year if you can because it\u2019s easier to make a friend group if you live on campus.",

            "comment": "Honestly, it depends on what you\u2019re planning on majoring in. Each school is stronger in different areas. \n\nIn terms of safety at DePaul (keep in mind I\u2019m a guy though) I\u2019ve never had an issue with safety AND I never knew any of the women classmates having issues. \n\nI\u2019m an alum so I\u2019m not sure exactly what you\u2019re referring to with the 2 women, but I never knew any women when I was there running into any issues either. I knew some people that ran into some close calls that could\u2019ve been a robbery but it didn\u2019t happen because they were smart enough to go a different way. \n\nRegarding the budget gap\u2014I agree it\u2019s an issue, however, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to make DePaul close. DePaul is one of the oldest and most respected colleges in Chicago. I think the school is finally seeing some programs they tried to build that simply weren\u2019t right for DePaul. \n\nI\u2019d be curious what your planned major is though, because that could change the suggestion, but I wouldn\u2019t write off DePaul based on your concerns just yet.",

DePaul is respected by many companies, but especially companies in Chicago. \n\nDePaul also has some exclusive partnerships with networking areas across the city. \n\nLoyola is working on their business program but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s up to DePaul\u2019s standards yet and they may not reach it. Loyola has a lot of their dollars caught up in their med and law schools (and rightfully so). \n\nIs there a certain focus of business you\u2019re interested in?",

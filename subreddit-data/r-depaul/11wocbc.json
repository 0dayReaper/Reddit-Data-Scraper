California, especially Southern California doesn't build stuff that way. \n\nAnyway, gloves, hats, scarfs obviously. If you have thermals bring them. I also recommend thick socks. Once we get cold you definitely want it. Also lotion, I know southern cal is a desert you should be fine. No its dry as hell up here in the winter. But lotion and maybe a mini desk humidifier.",

However in the winter/spring it can be unpredictable. I recommend bringing hoodies and light coat for fall. But being heavy jackets and warm joggers in the winter but keep some light clothes for the warm days during the spring.",

Winter in Chicago is cold as hell so you\u2019re gonna need hats, scarves, gloves, coats, jackets along with regular cold weather clothes like sweaters and long pants. Don\u2019t worry about looking like a ridiculous marshmallow. It gets well below 0 with windchill in the winter and it\u2019s much more important to protect your skin and extremities than it is to look good.\n\nFor spring and fall, I think you\u2019ll be good with whatever you have from living in southern CA. Light jackets, jeans, thin sweaters, etc.",

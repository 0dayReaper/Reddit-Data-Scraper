    "postText": "Hello!! \n\nI\u2019m a current junior and I\u2019ve been very intrigued by DePaul. The location, the activities is just \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udfff\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udfff. But, I\u2019ve been concerned about my social life and diversity. Some people have said DePaul isn\u2019t fun unless your apart of Greek life, and the majority of freshman don\u2019t live on campus. I also don\u2019t want to be the only black girl in my classes ( hoping to pursue law). Please be so honest about the social life and diversity?!??\n\n\nThank youuuuu\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96",

It\u2019s not a traditional Greek either, you don\u2019t have frat or sorority houses.\n\nMajority of freshmen don\u2019t live on campus cause majority are commuters so it kinda kills the social life at DePaul sometimes. \n\nI would say the social life at DePaul is decent if you make friends and have money to do stuff outside of school. It\u2019s not your \u201ctraditional\u201d college experience, as its replaced by city life. It\u2019s not a bad thing. As long as you have some sort of funds to eat, go to bars, concerts, games, other events, you\u2019ll be okay. Chicago is pretty expensive at times though. The neighborhood DePaul is in can have pretty pricey stuff as it\u2019s in the most expensive neighborhood in Chicago. But if anything that\u2019s more of a reason to branch out and explore w friends.\n\nHope that helps!",

As someone who lived in the dorms, they did feel like a hotel. \n\nPeople are saying that DePaul isn\u2019t very diverse, but my experience was the complete opposite experience. You have to look for what you need at DePaul, and most of what you look for will be found. I always saw more of a presence from the historically African American frats/sororities than the others. That, the DePaul Drag show (which is fun as fuck) and the large attention to the arts and social sciences is quite the recipe for diversity. Some just choose to see things through a certain type of lens I guess. You definitely won\u2019t be the only black girl in your class, even in law.",

While most of us are commuters, living in campus is a great way to make friends, and you\u2019ll still be able to have a social life! I\u2019d say most of my classes I\u2019ve taken are pretty diverse, so I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about that either. Come and check out the location sometime too! While DePaul has its ups and downs I think it\u2019s a really great school, especially since we\u2019re in the city",

As for diversity there are always none white people in my classes. So I highly doubt you will ever be the only minority. Especially not the only black girl. Theres at least 2-3 black people in most of my classes. Even in my smallest of classes, two of which are my besties \ud83e\udd70. But if one of them doesn't stop skipping imma throw some hands  \ud83d\ude02",

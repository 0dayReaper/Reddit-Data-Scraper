    "postText": "I\u2019m transferring in this fall and want to live in one of the Lincoln park apartment buildings, but it\u2019s hard to make a decision with the million different layouts/random pics that the housing website gives. If anyone can share their experience (or general recs) with the building and type of room they lived in, it would help a lot. \n\nI\u2019m pretty social, but I\u2019ve never had a roommate so pls let me know if any of the buildings are known for having pretty tight bedrooms so I can avoid them (or if any of them offer singles). My top choice right now is Sheffield but only bc someone on YouTube posted an entire apt tour and it seemed nice. \n\nAlso, if anyone has tips on finding roommates that\u2019d be great too, otherwise I\u2019m just going to stick to the random roommate selection.",

Put your interests and talk like you really are- look for people you want to be friends with and put your social media and look at theirs. \n\nAs for choosing dorms I was in Munroe, had a single. It worked for me but I\u2019m not super picky. Small but doable. Had a pull out couch under my lofted bed which made a lot of room for hanging out. The pull out was a full, and extended I think I had like another four feet before it would hit the opposite wall. If that gives you any context. Also fit a mini fridge and desk and all that. Singles in Munroe are deff better than the alternative of sharing. But at most you would share a room with one other and a bathroom w three. Not too bad if you have clean roommates but might be a fight to pee. Good luck!",

            "comment": "I had an absolute nightmare experience with DePaul Housing and trying to get an apartment with DePaul Housing.\n\nThe websites don't tell you the truth regarding what is or isn't available in certain areas. One part of the website will say one thing, while another says another thing. The info they give is either false or not really reliable in making a solid decision on where to live.\n\nIn terms of where to look and avoid, I'd definitely avoid Sanctuary Townhomes and McCabe Hall. McCabe has no AC, and the Townhomes have you living with 6 random people, all sharing a place together. You're already gambling when doing a random roommate and how bad they might be, you're not gonna get good odds with 6 random people.\n\nMe and a friend who planned to move in together found ourselves calling DePaul Housing multiple times over the most basic details. What places offered what, when we were supposed to simply *register* for housing. And from our experience, the people at Housing seem to have no idea what they're doing, and they even gave us attitude for following *their* poor instructions. I ultimately pulled out of my Housing Agreement because they switched my register date 3 different times, all in rapid succession. Their info was unreliable, they treated me and my friend poorly, and they didn't even seem to know when we were supposed to register. All of this, and I haven't even stepped foot in an apartment. If it's this bad just trying to get in, I don't want to imagine actually living in DePaul Housing.\n\nFrom my experiences and the opinions I've heard from two friends of mine who are RAs, I would avoid campus apartments entirely and look to find a place off-campus. You'll have a much better time, and avoid what is a big headache. If you're a social person, as you mentioned being, looking for a roommate shouldn't be hard. There are various hubs on Facebook and social media as a whole where you can connect with potential roommates and even friends!\n\nI'm sorry if this comment comes off as cynical or rude, I don't mean to hate on DePaul as a whole or on you, an incoming student. These are just my experiences and thoughts regarding DePaul Housing specifically, and whatever you choose to do, I wish you the best of luck. And welcome to DePaul! I hope you have an amazing time here :D",

Judging by the mess that is the housing website and the fact that I can\u2019t even log into the portal, I can tell I\u2019m in for a bumpy ride like yours. \n\nI eventually want to try for off campus housing (sooner rather than later now that I\u2019m aware of all of this), but I\u2019m coming into Chicago unemployed with student/parent plus loans covering all of my housing, so I don\u2019t want to commit to rent and not be able to pay. As a side question, do you find that most people can afford to pay for off campus housing with a part-time minimum wage job, or do they use their own savings/work full time while also in school?\n\nEither way, for now I\u2019ll definitely avoid McCabe and the Townhomes. Thank you for your warm welcome and your detailed comment!",

If anything, definitely just don't overstay your time living on campus if you don't have to, lol.\n\nTo answer your question; from what I've heard from friends of mine who have/do live off-campus, they can get by on rent and whatever other essentials just on the money they get from their jobs. However, that doesn't go for everyone. For example, I'm going to be living off-campus next year and my parents are going to be taking care of my rent, while I'm in charge of groceries and everything else you'd deem essential. Now, granted, that's because I haven't been working in a few months and I have had some bad spending habits. So my case isn't applicable to everyone else, and not everyone's parents have the money to do that. My sister graduating college this year gives my parents some extra money to spend, and they're choosing to be generous and help me out as I leave the house for the first time. \n\nOverall, I've found that most can get by on their jobs alone, however it's a case by case basis. Some people depend on loans to pay for rent and other essentials, some don't have to.\n\nAnd you are absolutely welcome for the comment! It's the least I can do. And if you want to be walking into DePaul with a friend, don't hesitate to shoot me a DM if you'd like to talk and be friends! I'm always open to meeting new people :)",

    "postText": "Can you use the studio space for personal projects if you are a student? Or is the space reserved for individuals who are only taking film classes? I am a film major, but it would be cool to be able to use the space on things like spring break and summer vacation. Do they need to only be used for School related content, or can I use Cinespace two help produce and create some of my own personal projects to add to my portfolio? Sorry if this is a stupid question, I genuinely don't know lol. Thank you!",

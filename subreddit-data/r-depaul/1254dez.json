Ohio State is more of the traditional college experience where DePaul is the big city life. Ohio state is more social and DePaul is more city life.",

I agree with everyone else who says the campuses and experiences will be different. \n\nDepending where you live it can be difficult to make friends at DePaul. I heard that they don\u2019t have many events on campus in comparison to Ohio which probably has a lot going on on campus. Chicago is a much bigger city but Columbus is still a city as well. It would be like comparing New York to Houston. Still a city and a lot to do but two completely different cities that would offer both their own unique experiences.",

Going to school in Chicago is still super cool and a great experience that i\u2019m glad i chose, but it\u2019s definitely a different vibe than your typical state school.",

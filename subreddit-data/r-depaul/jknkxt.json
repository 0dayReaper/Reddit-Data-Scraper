    "postText": "Avoid purchasing or renting from here at all costs. They have charged me the original rental price of a book three times over since I have yet to return one of their items. (They make no exceptions due to the pandemic). This has costed me hundreds of dollars over a single USED book!\nThe rental agreements are seemingly designed to lock you into paying more over time if you forget to return or cannot physically be there to return. \n It\u2019s not worth the money or the hassle. Amazon has next day delivery And almost always better prices. \n\nTLDR; college bookstores are the real scam of college",

Probably 80-90% of the books on all of my syllabi were \"optional\" or never used and the professor would say that one the first day of class.\n\nIn one of my classes almost no one bought the book because it was like $400. When we told the professor he was like \"oh shit really?\" and sent us all a PDF. That was pretty cool\n\nTLDR: Books are a scam rarely ever used. I only bought a handful and did fine\n\nEdit: Thanks to u/GeneralWinston I now know the plural of syllabus :P",

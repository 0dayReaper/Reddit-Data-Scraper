My question is, does DePaul offer online courses during any of the quarters? Asking bc I\u2019m transferring from an out of state school and will already have taken a years worth of terms off and will be graduating really late in comparison to my hs graduating class (I\u2019m apart of the hs class of 2020)",

DePaul offers online courses every quarter in different modalities - synchronous, asynchronous, hybrid, etc. \n\nNot every class is offered online, but a lot of them are, especially liberal arts credits! It really depends on your major as to how many of your classes will have an online option. \n\nBest of luck!",

Anything over that and you will have to pay for each extra credit hour. It gets expensive fast.\n\nI'm assuming you mean the December intersession? I have never done one. But another tip on that is any credit hours taken during that time are subtracted from your winter quarter hours. So you get 18 credit hours total for December intersession + winter quarter.\n\nI have only ever done the traditional school year: autumn, winter, and spring quarters!",

This would mean that for Winter Quarter (starting a month later in January), you could only take 10 credit hours before you would get charged extra. \n\nBasically, Intersession and WQ are billed together. So you get 18 credit hours total for the two. Anything over that, and again, you will be charged for each additional credit hour.",

As someone who was class of 17' and gapped for 2-3 years it makes no difference if you need more time. So don't pick more classes than you can realistically do, or you'll burn yourself out to quickly.",

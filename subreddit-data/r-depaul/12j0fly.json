    "postText": "Hii, for context, I\u2019m an incoming freshman who is not from The U.S so for my first year my parents feel safer having me stay on campus which means I will have to get a meal plan. Could anyone tell me if they have salad and/or fruit options every day? I saw on Instagram some dorm buildings have a kitchen, are students allowed to use it? Im currently recovering from an ED and knowing those things would calm my nerves a lot! Sorry if I sound rude, English is not my mother language \ud83e\udd72",

Sometimes they have salads and fruit for grab and go; sometimes it was at the student center but usually both were true. \n\nThere is help and access for everyone at DePaul. Some will say that there is not, but I\u2019ve found that those who couldn\u2019t find it never asked.",

I hugely recommend joining a club or going to club events and socializing. Theres some really good clubs on campus such as anime club that meets weekly, DEFRAG (Video game/gaming club) they host large socials and other game related events. They are well known for an event called geek till dawn where you get locked inside one of the campus buildings in thr loop all night to play games. We also have sports clubs and intermeral sports at the gym. So if you like basketball, volleyball, indoor soccer, flag football, etc. There are teams that set up each quarter to play twice a week. Its free, voluntary, and a great way to socialize.",

The big mess hall in the stu has a nice salad selection with all the toppings and dressings, even oil and vinegar if that's your fancy. \n\nI personally love making a salad with cucumbers, eggs, black olives, a little red onion, and a balsamic dressings. \n\nAs for fruit they have a bunch of different melons and pineapple. I'm a sucker for pineapple and enjoy getting a little strawberry yogurt and coconut flakes. \n\nThey also have bananas and sometimes oranges for students to grab too. \n\nAlso, you're gonna do great! Depaul has a lot of good options for food and things you might like. The Schmitt academic center (SAC) has a little food place called the bean that makes really great smoothies. Theres a nice tropical one i always encourage people to try, as it's like strawberries, oranges, and pineapple. \n\nIf you have any other questions or need any recommendations on things you might like please feel free to let me know. I love helping out new students and if it gives you any comfort about this big change that I would be thrilled to offer advice or feedback to you.",

You can buy cartons of berries or grapes in the grocery store area (ETC), but they are overpriced, not always in the best condition, and not always in stock.\n\nThe dorm kitchens are available to use whenever, though you will have to bring all of your own cooking and cleaning supplies!",

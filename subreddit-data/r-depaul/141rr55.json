I went to two graduations last year at Wintrust so I recommend getting there around 30 or so minutes early than you can be closer to the stage, if that's what you want. \n\nA lot of people also hold seats for their group, so areas might appear open then someone has claimed like 5 or so of the seats so just be mindful of the time and seating options.",

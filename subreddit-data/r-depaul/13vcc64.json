    "postText": "Hey everyone. So I payed my tuition deposit ($200) late. I payed it 5/25 when it was due 5/1. Also I was accepted into pathway honors program and accepted that 5/25 and it\u2019s deadline is 6/1. I still have to complete the placement test for math writing and chemistry. Am I gonna be alright? I\u2019m stressing cuz I did all of this very late and kinda nervous. I emailed my admissions counselor and she didn\u2019t respond. PLEASE HELP.",

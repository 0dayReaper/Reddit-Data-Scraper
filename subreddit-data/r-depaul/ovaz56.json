Then science shows we don't need to really do much more.\n\nMedia is scare mongering that the vaccine is only ~80% effective against the delta variant, when the thing that matters is the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing you from going to the hospital, which is still at over 99%.\n\nI did my part to protect others over the last year and a half by wearing masks everywhere. I did my part by getting the vaccine. Everyone has had the chance to get the vaccine if they wanted to by now. It is a personal choice if you haven't, and I don't want to have to tiptoe for the rest of my life because people can't do what is in their own best interest.\n\nThat doesn't mean if things change and a variant starts sending vaccinated people to the hospital and killing them en masse, I won't change my tune. I would go back to wearing a mask right away if the entire population is at risk. But right now the entire population is not at risk, only those that chose not to get vaccinated.",

Another variant shows up every year, I'm safe from it, everyone that vaccinated is safe from it, but we keep having to wear masks because there are people that didn't get vaccinated? Especially when those people are usually the ones not wearing masks themselves? Some even get mad at you for wearing a mask. Like, I'M TRYING TO PROTECT YOU!!! Why the hell do I have to inconvenience myself for the rest of my life to protect those people that don't want to be protected, and don't even want to protect themselves.\n\nAnd I really can't get over the fact that we are deviating from the current scientific consensus here. Vaccinated people are still not at anywhere near the same risk levels as before. The vaccine is over 99% effective from protecting you from being hospitalized by the new variant. Scientists say that vaccinated people are safe with unvaccinated people, let alone a school filled with *only* vaccinated people.\n\nTrust me, I was with everything 100% of the way, masks everywhere, reminding friends and family, even months after I got my vaccination because others hadn't had a chance to get it yet. Everyone has had the chance now though. Me, my friends, and my family are all safe. Why do we have to keep doing this, and how much longer will we have to? Because if it isn't stopping now I really don't see how it ever stops.",

They were \\*risk mitigation\\* tactics. They were NEVER about protecting everyone or guaranteeing safety. The only person who can do that for you is... you. An immunocompromised person needs to take drastic measures to ensure their health. That includes getting vaccinated, wearing masks and maybe staying home during spikes in cases.\n\nBut asking me and everyone else to keep covering our faces indefinitely is frankly not going to fly with the general population. We all did what we could before inoculations were available and we no doubt saved a lot of lives, but at some point, we all need to move on and the vulnerable need to do what they can to protect themselves.",

In fact, I remember during the thick of the pandemic the main worry about kids was them spreading it to adults!\n\nPlus, covid is a payload-dependent virus. If you get a little bit in your system from someone that barely had it? You will get mild symptoms most likely. If someone that really has it bad coughs directly into your mouth? You will get a bad case. If most people in your community/family are vaccinated, the chances of someone passing on a large payload of covid to a child is much less.\n\nAnd again, DePaul is 100% vaccinated",

So, if everyone was vaccinated, this variant would be a case of the sniffles for most people, with a very small percentage going to the hospital, but because the hospital is not being overrun, it is easily manageable and treatable. Instead, the vaccinated have the ability to spread it to the willingly unvaccinated, and it kills the willingly unvaccinated, so everyone has to wear a mask.\n\nAnd even if you don't agree with that, you have to at least acknowledge that we are currently setting the stage for yearly variants that we have to mask up for every time only because people won't vaccinate, and then those same people also won't mask up. So we're essentially masking up because of and to protect the group that doesn't care about protecting others. There are plenty of people that aren't going to like that, and that doesn't make them a bad person.\n\nP.S. Don't tell me to wear my mask. I have worn my mask in every situation I've been expected to up till now, and more, and I will continue to wear a mask in any situation where someone wants me to. Can't even express one idea that isn't echoed by the mainstream completely without people jumping down your throat about doing shit you've been doing the entire time.",

Remember the whole \"bend the curve\" stuff from last year?

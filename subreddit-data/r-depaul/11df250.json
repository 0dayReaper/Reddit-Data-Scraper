            "comment": "It is doable, but you're going to hate it because they are hard classes. So unless you really love bio and chem, just know its gonna be hard. \nI recommend putting one on Monday - Wednesday and the other tues - Thursday. Do not do the 8am labs! You may think its gonna be fun, but do not do them. You will hate it having to take a midterm exam at 8am. Pick somewhere in thr later morning / early afternoon.",

I have another friend that is outright a bio chem major, and a handful of other friends who have taken similar paths. So I know it is possible, but I know its hard. That's the reason I recommend different days, I dont recommend morning labs, its also to give you time to go to office hours. I'll also tell you a teacher that some love and some absolutely hate, Dr French. I believe he is bio. So way that at your own discretion, but honestly most of the core bio or chem teachers are not liked from what I've heard.",

Unless you are gifted at these classes, you'll want to attend office hours and you might need tutor time. No shame there. These classes are hard and often designed to weed out the students who aren't prepared to take such hard classes. You can even message the teachers before the quarter begins and ask them for when their office hours will be.",

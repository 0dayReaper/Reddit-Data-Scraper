            "comment": "&gt; DePaul faculty council voted unanimously to allow all undergraduate students to opt into a pass/fail grading system for any and all of their classes this spring quarter. To get a \u201cpass\u201d grade, students must receive a grade of D or higher. \nStudents will have until the day before classes end, not including final exams, to decide whether they want their grades to be reflected as a pass or fail.",

If the course is failed, the F grade is recorded on the student\u2019s record and the credit hours attempted are included in computing the student\u2019s grade point average.\n\nSo either you pass and get credits (no impact on GPA), if you fail you get an F. Seems pretty fair.\n\nEdit: this was updated to now requiring earning at least a C- to get a grade of Pass. Grades of D+ or below earn those marks.",

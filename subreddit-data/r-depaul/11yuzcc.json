    "postText": "My daughter was admitted to DePaul and it\u2019s very high on her list but the financial aid offer was a bit lower than we hoped. We wanted to submit an appeal form to see if we could potentially get some grant money or work study but we can\u2019t access it through bluekey. \n\nWe are using the bluekey password that we used to submit the housing deposit but it kept saying it was incorrect and then locked her account. No response from the financial aid office.  Is there any other way to access the appeal form?",

            "comment": "You can look up depaul appeal form and they will pop up first. You have several options for whichever quarter she\u2019s interested. If it locked her account you have to call depaul central. \nUsually to log in depauls websites it asks for the first letter, last name @depaul.edu and whatever password you came up with, but I remember locking my account as well because it is a little confusing at the beginning.\nBest of luck!",

Make sure you're adding the  @ depaul.edu to the username. Have you tried calling for assistance? Or using the new student financial aid email?",

We did not add \u201c@depaul.edu\u201d since we didn\u2019t have to do that to log in for the housing deposit. \n\nHowever, it sounds like the locked out status does not expire after a period of time like for Apple so we need to contact the help desk ( which seems to require a phone call anyway- Not the most user friendly as it\u2019s not easy to find time to make phone calls. ). \n\nThanks for the info!",

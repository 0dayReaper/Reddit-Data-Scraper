Has anyone taken honors discover Chicago?\n\nAlso... when do we choose which track we want to take? Any and all advice is welcome!! Thank you!!",

So, it might help you bond with folks sooner/more easily. \n\nTell us what you mean by \u201ctrack.\u201d  Like the commenter said above, if you mean the Discover topic, you\u2019ll pick that closer to orientation. If you mean your major, that could be any time in the next 2 years.",

So, if none of the topics are popping out to you, look up the instructors to see if they teach for departments you are interested in. If nothing stands out there, pick your class according to when you want to be in class or choose a time that leaves your schedule open for other classes you might want.",

Actually saw the city and had a blast. Still talk to people from that class going into third year.\n\nHonors might have improved since Covid has lessened and allowed more stuff but I know a lot of people who had pretty lame ones as they were stuck in the classroom the whole time :(",

            "comment": "DePaul Honors Program here. Only Honors students can take Honors Discover or Honors Explore classes. The reason why is because Honors Discover/Explore will typically be your first Honors class and an introduction to how Honors classes work. They are designed to help you navigate not only Chicago and DePaul, but learn what to expect from the Honors Program. There are fewer Honors classes to choose from simply because there are fewer Honors students than the general population. You will register for your Honors Discover/Explore class over the summer when you meet with your advisor. If you have questions or want to know the difference between a Discover Chicago and Explore Chicago, feel free to email [honorsprogram@depaul.edu](mailto:honorsprogram@depaul.edu)",

    "postText": "I don't know if this is a general college thing and the pandemic just messed up everyone's maturity progress, but I've met SO many people here that are straight up obnoxious, childish, immature, etc.\n\nI went here for a year before I left because it was crazy expensive and they weren't giving me nearly as much scholarship money as other private colleges were offering, plus I wanted to change my major but couldn't afford to stay any longer than I initially planned. I still have a few (normal, chill) friends here, and they seem to have great difficulty meeting people and making other friends here.\n\nThe friends they have made ended up acting extremely inappropriate when we would hang out, and just seemed to overall lack social skills or any self awareness. I'm aware I myself have a lot of maturing and growing up to do, we are all young college kids after all, but this was on a whole other level. Still, I hear stories from them making friends with people here only for them to do something extremely inappropriate or messed up and having to drop them.\n\nPeople here also generally seem to be more guarded in general and difficult to talk to and/or hang out with outside of class. There's also a whole other subset of kids that come from wealthy mostly suburban families and just seem to party 24/7 (although this happens at literally every school). \n\nI know I'm probably biased because of my own experiences and anecdotes, and I truly have met some very normal, friendly people here, and with a school of ~15k undergrads, you're bound to meet a wide array of different people. But I still don't understand why a disproportionate amount of the people me and my friends have met here ended up acting extremely rude, inappropriate, lack self awareness/social skills, etc. Anyone else have similar experiences, or even a counter argument?",

However, there is a pretty good minority population here so I wouldn\u2019t be too afraid of that. The professors and staff are wonderful and nice. Plus Chicago is a pretty democratic city. About the safety alerts, that\u2019s normal for any city I would say. Chicago just gets a lot of attention about its crime, however, it\u2019s still relatively rare. Especially at DePaul since it\u2019s north side and has guards sometimes patrolling the area. The trains are usually packed with kids traveling between both Lincoln park and loop campus during school hours. In other words, don\u2019t be afraid of it. Just like in any city, keep an eye open and stay alert! Don\u2019t stay out too late unless your in a group, don\u2019t go to sketchy areas, etc etc.",

I even considered going back myself bc it's in the city and a good school academically, but it was too expensive for my current financial situation.

I'll limit my friends to some of the people in my major and those from my ethnic community (who will most likely be my roommates later on too).\n I really don't want/need to know more people because I've decided to focus on my education and a small yet functional group of friends &amp; social activities. There are a few clubs I am looking forward to joining, but I don't want to dilute my energy there either, since I'm mainly focused on my studies.\nWhile I will make myself approachable to those in my classes and residence hall/apt, I wouldn't want to go any further. I get why people limit their social interactions even though I'm pretty extroverted. Every person isn't a safe one to be around.\nI also think being in the city would be great. It does have a great bustling vibe (in the Loop) and a college campus feeling (at LP). I am worried about the food though. Are there any good vegan options? And is the dining hall the only place to eat on campus? (I'm asking about LP for both those questions) Vegetarian food is fine too, but I usually follow a vegan diet, so please let me know about both!",

The thing is, she loved my friends but HATES me. Gave me major stink eye and completely ignored me whenever I spoke, wouldn't laugh at my jokes, etc. One day I was sitting in the dining hall with my two friends and I had my bag in the chair next to me. She bubbly greets them and of course ignores me, then turns to me, frowns, and says, \"um, can you move your bag so I can sit here?\" And my friends got uncomfortable how she was treating me so blatantly bad in front of them. She also bragged about going out with my friends ex to his face right after they broke up. She made up a fake boyfriend and would actuallt talk about him in conversations. A lot of her close friends gossiped about her a lot, but she was still \"popular\" in a sense that she hung out with a ton of people and knew everyone. She was also incredibly loud and obnoxious with no filter, just said the first dumb thing that came into her head. \n\nWe had another friend we invited over to our apartment for a small Halloween party, she kept making weird inappropriate comments about me and trying to force me to sit in her lap in front of everybody. \n\nOne of my roommates would constantly and casually talk about wanting to off herself to us and everyone that would listen (we were not close) and would catatonically stare off into space on the couch and get all mopey, but then be fine a few minutes later. Would also complain a lot about the homeless people and how \"ghetto\" certain parts of the city were and say weird things of that nature, kinda like she thought she was above all yhat bc she's from the suburbs. She would also just say really cringe and annoying stuff. \n\nMy friend made friends with this guy recently, who seemed normal until they invited him over for the first time and he started eating stuff out of their fridge without asking, picked up the cat inappropriately, running around the tiny apartment and making a mess, some other stuff I can't remember.\n\nWe went to a LGBT club once and there was a guy who became obsessed with my same friend. He said he was straight but only attracted to AFAB nonbinary people. He constantly asked to walk them back to their dorm, and once tried to chase them because he wanted to corner them and talk to them. He ended up getting kicked out bc other people reported him doing the same. This friend has overall had a lot of creepy incel guy experiences here. \n\nThere are a few more I can think of, but I've already written enough for now, but if you want more entertainment I'd be happy to share.",

However some of these people are messed up and are straight up PERVERTS for what they've done/said. Honestly I'm very shocked and worried about living there, especially on campus (while I know it's safe on the outside, the inside HOUSES so many kinds of people.)\nNow I will say that I have dealt with or seen people deal with similar people and situations in the past. And you're right, we're all just a bunch of college kids. BUT THERE ARE LIMITS. \nI also get why people seem so reserved. There's the whole superiority complex, and since a lot of them (like you mentioned) are wealthy and from the suburbs, they're probably ALREADY aware/cautious about the type of people they could encounter, especially in the city. DePaul is a commuter school and the people living on campus or in the apartments are probably out of state or international students.\nThe \"cool gay kids\" thing- NOT OKAY. Why is she so desperate and why are people in general so desperate to be one among the LGBTQ+ community AND if you're not a part of it why would you even want to ANNOY the people of a certain friend group. The desperation fr\ud83d\ude2d And if you are a part of the community, make other friends, it's not like a certain friend group isn't the only one in this community. Everything else that you mentioned about that person makes me sick.\nAlso the whole sexual predator problem is terrible. I am definitely scared about being targeted by them, especially as a minority female. (I'm not going to date during college either, it's effed up)\nTo the girl who wanted to off herself and talks sh* about homeless people and \"ghetto\" parts of the city- go to therapy.\n I will NEVER bring sketchy people home, or just anyone right after I meet them. I was already thinking of this and your information has steered to me to be more cautious.\nI am really grateful and appreciative of the fact that you gave examples too. As someone who hasn't lived away from home, I was very worried. But now I know what to look out for and where/how to look out for myself :)",

Social skills is no long necessary because we can just watch a video and pretend that we know them by heart and know who they are as a person when reality they never met, seen, or talked before. With how someone is raised it sadly doesn't matter where they live its how their parents are behind closed door is what your thought should be with why they act out because their entire life thats what normal is for their reality their parents gave them.",

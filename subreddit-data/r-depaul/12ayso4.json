And outside of those hours it\u2019s still very safe just if you are alone, particularly if ur a woman, have your guard up a bit bc harassment has happened to me outside those hrs. And don\u2019t go through the alleys or more \u201cvulnerable\u201d spaces like the quad in the middle of the night. But that\u2019s common sense. Just watch for $1000 baby strollers and the occasional dog fight. Today I learned ur more likely to get ur car windows shatters by a wind-bound dumpster than get violence inflicted upon you.",

I personally avoid the redline after 9 pm if I'm going to be alone. But Depaul students are usually leaving classes and commuting at the same times, so you won't be alone. I love the brown line. If you end up alone on a train at night and you are nervous, get in the car closest to the conductor. You'll be alright. The only bad thing that has happened to me is getting cat-called (would happen anywhere). The only bad thing that's happened to my friends is being pic-pocketed (be aware of where your things are if you are going to be drunk in public lol!).\n\nLincoln Park is one of the safest neighborhoods in the city. The loop is super safe during the day, and safe with common sense at night. Just keep your wits about you and you'll be totally fine.",

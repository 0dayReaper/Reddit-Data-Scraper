            "comment": "I would recommend DePaul in a way because of the smaller class sizes. So far, I\u2019ve only gotten classes with 12-25 people. It\u2019s a nice touch because you can talk to your professor easier and ask for help when needed.  Everyone is really nice and friendly here! It makes you feel comfortable.\n\nThe only con I\u2019ve seen so far at DePaul is the lack of activities and engagement on campus. Stuff happens every now and then, but not many people attend as it\u2019s a commuter school. I\u2019m a commuter myself. It\u2019s not necessarily a con for everyone, as the city is supposed to be your campus. They don\u2019t want you staying at DePaul, but to explore the many things chicago has to offer. With that being said, loyolas campus is also bigger than DePauls.\n\nI feel as if you can get the same social life at either school. You\u2019ll have access to the city no matter what, as both schools have the red line close to their campuses. I would weigh the pros and cons of each school, but focus on which has the better program.",

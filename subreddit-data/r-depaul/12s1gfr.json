    "postText": "Daughter was admitted to Class of 2027 and we placed a housing deposit as we understood housing was limited and that the deposit was refundable until May 1st. \n\nWell we ended up cancelling her housing on March 29th via email and they responded back confirming our cancellation and that our deposit would be refunded in 3-4 weeks. That seemed like a long time and I figured it would come sooner. \n\nWell it\u2019s been 3 weeks as of today and I am hoping the refund comes in the next week but I just wanted to see what others experiences have been with getting back their deposits.",

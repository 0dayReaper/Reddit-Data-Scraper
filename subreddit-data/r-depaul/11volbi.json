What has been your perceived difficulty of these classes? hours necessary to study to be an average high achiever? What are some tips you would ?",

I'm taking 2 courses a quarter and it's a lot but it's manageable as long as you stay on top of everything. \n\nSometimes work is too much and I have to submit a lower effort assignment because there is not enough time in the day, but so far I've been able to keep high grades and all that jazz.\n\nDoable, but I'm tired. 5 classes to go.",

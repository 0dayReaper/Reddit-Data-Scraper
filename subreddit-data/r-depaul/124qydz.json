    "postText": "Hi :) I\u2019m a senior in High School from Oregon and moving out of state to Chicago for school. I love the city and want to take advantage of the health science internships and connections. I\u2019m having a hard time choosing between UIC and DePaul. \n\nI visited both campuses and to me it seemed like UIC being in downtown, was more lively, however I loved Depaul\u2019s huge library and it\u2019s only a train ride to downtown so locations not a big deal. DePaul also has smaller classes and better professors. I\u2019m planning to major in Health Science. \n\nWith the financial aid DePaul offered, it turned out cheaper than UIC. And it doesn\u2019t make sense to me to go out of state to a public school which will end up more expensive than a private school.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Also is DePaul known better than UIC? In terms of applying for internships related to health science and jobs after. Let me know . Really appreciate it :)",

DePaul also has a campus in the loop (downtown). This comes down to preference. But if DePaul is cheaper I\u2019d go for it. DePaul is a very good option if you plan to stay in Illinois but if you plan to go back to Oregon after college UIC may be a better choice.",

As such, I believe what is needed now is an actual increase in the subreddit users, so I want to hear from you guys...\n\nWhat initially brought you to this subreddit?\n\nWould you recommend other DePaul students/faculty/staff to use this subreddit?\n\nWhat do you think should be done to advertise/spread word of this subreddit both to current students and potentially alumni?\n\nPlease use this thread as a place for discussion of these topics as well for suggesting QoL improvements to this subreddit! Thanks guys, enjoy your summer break!",

I would reach out the leadership of various clubs and get them to start using the subreddit. Even if that just means this sub becomes a nothing but club meeting announcements that would still be a massive improvement. ",

This may seem like an oversimplified solution, but I think the best way to increase involvement would be for current students to post more thought-provoking and open-ended threads that allow for extensive debate. Most of the threads in this subreddit seem to consist of incoming freshman or transfer students asking about campus life, dorms, courses, etc. This isn\u2019t a bad thing by any means, but DePaul is a relatively large school with well over 20,000 students\u2014there are always interesting or controversial things going on that we can (and should) talk about. Moreover, these sorts of discussions would better represent the collective mindset of the student body and give prospective students a better understanding of \u201cthe DePaul experience,\u201d so to speak. \n\n\nIf the goal is to increase involvement, all you can do is put forth the effort to create some kind of a dialogue and hope that it resonates with someone. The more consistently this sort of thing happens, the more likely it is that people will return for a similar and (hopefully) enlightening experience. ",

Sit outside in the common area and just be open to chatting and meeting new people.\n\n\nIf you're into more than just board games, come check out the game lab on the 5th floor of CDM and our new esports gaming center in the DePaul center. You'll know the places I'm talking about soon enough if you don't already lol",

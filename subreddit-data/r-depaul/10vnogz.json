    "postText": "Hi everyone! \n\nI was recently admitted to Depaul. I was wondering how much the total cost of attendance typically is including tuition, room, board, fees, etc. (assuming I got no merit scholarship or financial aid). I am getting a bunch of mixed answers on Google and would love any advice/numbers you may have.\n\nAlso on the housing application, it says that roommates are not guaranteed if you request one. Has anyone not gotten the roommate they requested? Also are there ways to ensure you end up with the roommate you request?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you so much!!",

            "comment": "hi! financial aid and merit scholarships go a long way but depaul\u2019s tuition is about 42,000 and dorms can cost anywhere between 10,000-15,000 depending on the size and # of roommates as well as the required meal plan (if living on campus) which i believe ranges from about 1,000-3,000. lots of money to spend just for college but do not fret!!! depaul offers lots of help and im only paying about 6,000 a year for my tuition right now. i suggest appealing whatever financial aid offer they give you no matter what! they will almost always reward you with more money as long as u needed it on the first place. hope this helped and let me know if u have any other questions!",

I would love to go to school there, but without more scholarships or aid I cannot see it being feasible. I would love to know what steps you took to appeal your financial aid if you wouldn\u2019t mind sharing. :)",

I\u2019m a film student, and without my scholarship/ financial aid id be paying a little over 50,000.\n\nThe best way to ensure you\u2019ll get your requested roommate is to just make sure your housing agreements match up and you sign up as early as possible. I think it\u2019s pretty unlikely they\u2019d give you someone different though cause everyone I know got the roommate they requested",

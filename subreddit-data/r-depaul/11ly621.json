That being said DePaul housing is so much more expensive than the normal market, so I would recommend getting a place up north or down south a stop or two on the red or brown. That is where the good and affordable college housing is.",

Also, in the suite you're sharing with your roommates the walls dont go all the way to the roof. Its like a 2ft gap on the top so no noise canceling for you. \n\nAs someone who lives off campus its nearly the same price to just go live in a studio near the train line.",

            "comment": "I lived in Clifton (which I think is no longer there) and Sanctuary in a 6-person apartment.\n\nMy time at Sanctuary was unique. 6 of us shared a 3-floor apartment there. One of our roommates was literally a Saudi prince and quite obviously had never taken care of himself before. He left food sitting out in the kitchen, left his dirty clothes to sit until they literally smelled like cheese, he spilled bleach on the apartment carpet and refused to fess up to it. Living with 5 other people was a mess, but in retrospect it really built conflict management skills. At Clifton I was meant to room with one other person, but instead was offered a THIRD person to live with us for a discount of one or two hundred dollars off my rent. Not. Worth it. Three people living in a 15x15 ft room was insane. Especially when we had girls over.\n\nIf I could do one thing differently about my college experience it would be to have lived off-campus. Not because I hated the people but because the cost of living on-campus was obscene and not worth the price. But you need to know yourself - are you outgoing enough to go to school events and make friends? Can you resolve conflicts with roommates without the use of an RA? If so, live off campus! Are you shy or a little bit introverted and need other people around to pull you out of your shell? Definitely live on campus for your first or second year. It can make a big difference to whether school feels like a place where your friends and family are, or feel like a place where you go for the day and then leave immediately.",

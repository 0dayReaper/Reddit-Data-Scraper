I just transferred to DePaul this year, so I don't really know all the problems students face routinely. I'm just posting this to see how everyone's doing this semester. Hope things are going well. Anyone frustrated? This community doesn't seem to active, and when it is, it's usually people complaining about something. I think we'd all do a bit better if we're engaged in DePaul, maybe have a thread to air some of grievances.",

I just transferred from a community college and I was really looking forward to going to school in Chicago; I want to experience DePaul's campus, go to games, etc. I'm paying all of this damn money and it seems like I'm getting ripped off. Hopefully I'll be able to attend eventually but who knows. I live in Chicago already so I can still go about the city but I was really looking forward to making friends and getting involved with groups and the like.",

I took some more challenging classes since I\u2019m a junior now, but I got COVID and because of that I had to drop one since there was no way I\u2019d be able to catch up after being sick for two weeks. Plus, I just don\u2019t learn almost anything as well as I do in person as I do online. It just doesn\u2019t work for me.  On top of all that, I never noticed how much I rely on the idea that \u201cI have to go to class\u201d in order to get my work done because without it I just absolutely procrastinate everything until the last possible minute. \n\nI\u2019m more concerned about you though, transferring to DePaul this year is pretty unlucky, I\u2019m sorry about that dude. I hope you get to get the full experience before you graduate - I\u2019m so bored of sitting inside all the time, I just wanna know what it\u2019s like to ride the L to class every day again and walk around the loop. I miss that so much. And I feel like there\u2019s still a lot I haven\u2019t experienced yet too haha. I\u2019m a junior and never been to a DePaul basketball game, although I hear that\u2019s pretty common. If we ever get out of here though, you best believe I\u2019ll be wearing a full on cheerleader outfit and pom poms at the next basketball game, hairy chest and all just hanging out. I don\u2019t care.",

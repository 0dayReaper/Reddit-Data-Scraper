    "postText": "I was at the downtown campus chilling with a few friends before class, and we were just talking sitting on one of the sofa chairs on the 8th floor lobby or whatever. When it was time for my class I must've dropped my wallet on one of these chairs. \n\nWhen I realized I didn't have my wallet at the end of the class I panicked. I had over $500 in my wallet that I was going to go deposit after class, not to mention credit cards, IDs and other things. I looked everywhere around the chairs, but couldn't find anything. I eventually checked my email and saw that the security of DePaul emailed me saying that they had my wallet!\n\nWhen I went to go check everything was still inside. When I asked, the security officer told me that a professor turned it in. This just shows what type of people are at DePaul. Just wanted to share my good luck and some good news.",

I think the people here are friendlier and nicer too. \n\nOnly thing is cost, however DePaul usually gives students ~4,000 minimum a quarter and if you apply for the plethora of scholarships and financial aid you should come out with maybe $1000-$5000 a quarter depending on your scholarships",

If you\u2019re leaning more towards health, and math/cs I think UIC may be better.\n\nThe student body is completely different too in my experience. The price point between the two university is clearly shown when you interact with depaul vs UIC, not necessarily saying one is better than the other, but there is a different attitude and air. \n\nProfessors in my opinion also seem to care more for whatever reason at DePaul maybe because their alumni or most hold PhD, but are not so smart they cannot teach though there are some",

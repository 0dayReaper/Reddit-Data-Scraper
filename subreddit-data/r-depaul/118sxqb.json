            "comment": "I got my Masters in CS at DePaul. It's as good or as bad as you want it to be. Lots of the core classes are painfully easy (if you have CS background). Electives range from super easy to borderline ridiculous time-wise (if you're also working), so I definitely recommend taking things that are interesting to you and referencing things like ratemyprofessor to get the better teachers. In fact, I found one I liked so much I'm coming back to get my PhD, so there's that! :)",

Can we get internships? Ik it's more of our hardwork included in getting jobs. Thank you for your information and all the best for your PhD.",

You can half-ass it and get by and get a degree - or you can take advantage of the offerings really put your time in and get a lot more out of it. I will say having some programming knowledge will go along way. When I went thru the program a number of us took a quarter off to go thru a coding Bootcamp to be able to do our homework more effectively.",

Some of these professors are complete pushovers/don't really know what they're doing, and others are experts in their fields and will challenge you. I took the fluff classes for things I wasn't interested in, and the \"harder\" ones for the ones I was. Luckily, most of the core courses (which have nothing to do with what I do professionally like OOP and DB) were super easy and not even half as difficult/comprehensive as the corresponding versions I had to take in undergrad",

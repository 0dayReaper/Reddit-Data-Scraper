What do you suppose I do?",

I want this crap over as much as the next person for sure, I just feel like that is a big risk to take with my personal health for something that most likely is not a danger to me, and others who it is a danger to should already have the vaccine",

The way the email DePaul sent out phrases it, it sounds like students/faculty/staff *have* to obtain vaccination prior to returning to campus in the fall - no exceptions. To anyone who isn't in a high-risk group, and/or who wants to wait until one/all of the vaccine(s) obtain full FDA approval, they can get a medical exemption. All others have to get vaccinated before returning to campus. There's also going to be religious exemptions, but I'll hold off on giving my thoughts on that.",

The way it reads is polarizing, where it sounds like they're saying what you mentioned: anyone wanting to return to campus in the fall *must* be vaccinated against COVID.  In reality, it's no different than any of their other vaccine requirements.  Anyone who doesn't want the vaccine can submit a medical or religious exemption and return to campus.  They'll probably be tested for COVID routinely, but as long as they're negative for COVID, they'll likely be able to participate like everyone else who had been vaccinated.\n\nAnyone not in a high-risk group that doesn't want to get vaccinated while the vaccines are only approved for use via Emergency Use Authorization, as opposed to full FDA approval, should be able to get a waiver from their physician.  Hell, I got both Pfizer doses and *I'm* worried that there might be unnoticed/unrecognized adverse events related to the Pfizer vaccine - especially in light of how the [CDC &amp; FDA have recommended a pause on administration of the J &amp; J vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0413-JJ-vaccine.html).\n\nThere's a lot about both COVID and the vaccines that we just don't know, and I can't blame a healthy 18-22 year old college student for wanting to wait until full FDA approval; to them the risk of adverse events from vaccination might outweigh the risk of complications from COVID infection, which sounds reasonable to me.  In that case, they can just submit a medical waiver and call it a day.",

There have been a few thousand people who *have* died at some point in time after receiving vaccination(s), but no deaths have been shown to be *directly caused* by the vaccine itself.\n\nI figured that surely *at least* one person has died from the vaccine, but I'm actually really pleasantly surprised to find this out. I think there's a few cases they're still looking at with the J &amp; J vaccine; however, I've got to say that I'm really impressed by how well scientists managed to not only create these vaccines as quickly as they have, but also provide the remarkablely high level of safety and efficacy too.",

Now that that's out of the way, don't twist my words, I said there are no credible reports of anyone dying from covid. Do you believe the medalerts reports? Let's also take a look at the fact that you are ignoring the adverse effects of covid for young people that don't die from it. Including damage to the heart, lung, and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Not to mention blood clots. (Mayo Clinic: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351#:~:text=Brain.,Parkinson's%20disease%20and%20Alzheimer's%20disease.). I also find it interesting interesting you question government reports and then cite a .gov. even if we are to take your source at face value (which we shouldn't, considering VAERS themselves states that reports of adverse events don't indicate causation, and because of the fact that anyone can submit a report, including those who may be anti-vax.) That would still be a lower risk than catching covid itself, considering the higher number of deaths and the MUCH higher chance of long-term adverse effects.",

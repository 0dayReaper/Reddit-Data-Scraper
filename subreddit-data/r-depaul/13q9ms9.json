I'm about to finish next quarter!\n\nI didn't take the GAE for the intro courses, but I would say specifically for HCI 406, the Robbins text that is mentioned as the study guide was the text we used for class.\n\nHTML - Get really familiar with semantic markup. Understand how to create a simple HTML document. Code editors do this work for you, but I would assume that the exam requires that you know this info.\n\nCSS - At a minimum, understand CSS selectors, rules, page layout techniques (flexbox and grid), and box model.",

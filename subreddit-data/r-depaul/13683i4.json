Fall tuition is due by Sep 1, 2023. \n\nI'm pretty sure that you have to pay each quarter individually because your total tuition can differ from various factors. So, you will have to make 3 separate payments... I'm fairy certain. \n\nHere's the academic calendar for dates: [https://academics.depaul.edu/calendar/Pages/default.aspx](https://academics.depaul.edu/calendar/Pages/default.aspx) (make sure to change to the correct school year)",

The thing is we\u2019re paying full for the entire school year (I got a lot of scholarship so we\u2019re not paying a lot even for just the full year) \nYou said how the price changes for each quarter? We know how much each quarter is and all and it\u2019s barely much and my parents were saying how if we did a payment plan they take extra fees and we\u2019d be paying more than we need to",

Also, if you moved up in status to an upperclassman and met certain criteria, then it would also increase. If this is your first year though, and you just plan to be full time, you will probably have the same tuition each quarter. \n\nI've never heard of anyone paying upfront for a whole year. But, there are a lot of people who pay 3 times a year (just before autumn quarter, again before winter, and again before spring). This isn't a \"payment plan.\" It is just breaking the total into three payments that are billed at specific times throughout the year. \n\nI am enrolled in a payment plan that is monthly. My total tuition for the year is divided by 12 and yes, there are fees for that. But, I think you just want to pay your balance each quarter which is different. \n\nI could be wrong, maybe you can pay for a whole year upfront, but again, I've never met anyone who has. \n\nBest of luck.",

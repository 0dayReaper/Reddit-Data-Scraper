It\u2019s hard to manage my time efficiently, and it seems like professors give out a lot more homework and longer lectures. Classes are supposed to be an hour and half or so, yet my some professors are giving me 2 hour lectures and they add up. Oh well tho gotta do what gotta do.",

            "comment": "I've noticed that all of my classes that post pre-recorded lectures (instead of having live Zoom lectures) are a lot harder. The professors pack so much content into their pre-recorded videos and expect us to remember it all. I guarantee they would not be able to get through so much material if the lectures were live, so they should not be testing us over that extra material.\n\nAlso, I feel like I spend a lot of extra time having to correct professors' mistakes in this online format (submission folders not being up, due dates being unclear, gradebook errors, etc.). These are small things, but the time it takes to contact professors, wait for responses, and wait for the issue to be fixed really adds up.\n\nI'm not sure if these are the same kind of issues you're having, but know you're not alone in feeling that most of the online classes DePaul is offering right now are a lot more work.",

I\u2019m mostly doing my work just to get it done. Before in class at least I felt like I was processing everything, online just sucks. And I\u2019ve taken 1-2 online classes on top of in person classes before Covid and they were fine! But this is just overwhelming and confusing.",

Lecture in person are forgetful or lazy vs being able rewatch recordings, flexible schedule, etc. They're hard but at least so far it's helped.",

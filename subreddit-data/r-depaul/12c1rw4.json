We\u2019re searching for 1 or 2 more female roommates to go in on a lease in the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area.\n\nAnyone know how to go about finding additional roommates for off campus housing? There used to be a \u201cDePaul Students Living Off- Campus\u201d Facebook group, but it appears to have been deactivated.",

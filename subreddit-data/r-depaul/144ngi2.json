Only clear bags or the one given by depaul are allowed.\nAll grades are seated based on their school but not based on their name etc. When it\u2019s your turn, you form a queue and handover your name card. They read you name using that and give you diploma holder after which you sit down. You are not even guaranteed to sit in the same place before and after your turn.",

            "comment": "Hi,\n\nSo seating for you and your family is not organized. When you show up you'll be given a card with your name that you'll carry until you reach the stage. Then someone will collect the card from you so that it can be read. You are allowed to bring your phone, but no regular bags. My sibling gave her clear bag of essentials to me the day before so I could bring it, because bags are NOT allowed unless they are clear. She also gave me tickets, because you will NOT be able to meet them prior unless they show up with you. They need to enter the arena through the standard security entrances like everyone else.\n\nAs for walking this is how it goes. You show up, they make sure you have your proper regalia. They make you a card with your name and GPA status title, like cum laude or whatever correlates to you. You will be guided in a line to your seating and the area around you with have several professional staff members present to point your ground in the right direction. They will clear you each row by row, starting each section front to back. You will end up in a line that wraps around the arena floor and leads to the stage. They will guide you, so don't panic, people are there to tell you what to do! Once you near the stage they'll check your tussle placement, take your card, say your name, and you'll walk across the stage. Then they will point you back to your seat. Thats all that happens.\n\nNext, I'd say tell your family to arrive 30-40 mins prior so they can find a good spot to watch you walk. They will not be sitting with you. You'll be sitting on the flat floor, like the arena ground zero. Your family will be sitting in thr available seating around the arena.",

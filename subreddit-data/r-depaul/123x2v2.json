I'm an international student and i recently got accepted to depaul as a freshman for Political science as a major. \n\nIn fact, i though after high school i will be done with maths but I have to do the Math placement test and was wondering if this test will have a considerable impact on my choice of subjects or on my classes and if yes which ones? \n\nFor people who had a request similar to mine, was the test really difficult? and what was the impact of this test in the time that followed? \n\nAll answers, advices and recommendation would be welcomed:)\n\nThank you for your kind considerations in advance:)",

Doesn't take long and honestly doesn't mean a lot if you plan to stick with political science. \n\nThe only math classes you'll likely take are \nLSP-MAT 120 (how to use excel for math) (required by all)\nStatistics (normally only require you to have completed LSP 120) (required by all)\nA Computation reasoning course. (Normally really easy)\nThen possibly LSP 121. (Varies major to major)\n\nIf for whatever reason you decide to not be a poli sci major and you want to do a science. Then you're going to have to take more math classes. For example, let's say you want a minor in computer science. You'd also have to take MAT 130, then MAT 140 discrete math. If you test well enough you can get out of MAT 130. Its precalc  if I remember correct. \n\nSo I recommend trying your best, because if you want to do other things you can easier. But it won't kill you if you place bad.",

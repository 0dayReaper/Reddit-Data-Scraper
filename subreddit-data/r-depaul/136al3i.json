    "postText": "Hi everyone. So I'm starting the Master's in HCI program in-person in January,, but I wanted to know what student life looks like on campus. I will be commuting, but I was trying to see if there was like student orgs or anything that I can get involved in, especially an Asian social org. For reference I went to UIUC for undergrad and obviously the community is very different between the two schools. \n\nAlso I was thinking of looking for a part-time job since the program seems to be very night-oriented, and any advice related to that would also be super helpful!",

            "comment": "Regarding student organizations you can join, I'd go to DeHub. With your Campus Connect login, you'll be able to find organizations based on what you're looking for. \n\nThis next part is a bit of a side ramble, don't feel like you have to read lol:\n\nCommuting tends to get a bad rep. I've heard people throw out the idea that since you're not living on campus with your peers, you'll be left out of most social situations. As a commuter student for two years, I would disagree. There are plenty of people who commute to campus, whether they've lived in Chicago their whole lives and are commuting or who have gotten their own place after a few years of school. Socializing isn't too hard. Most people are in your same position, trying to make friends in a new setting, so feel free to utilize the shared interest. Utilize moments where you're able to talk to people who sit next to you in classes, whether it's your professor having you guys do group discussion in class or through group projects, so on so forth. Greek life is really small at DePaul, it's there if you want to join but if you don't you're not missing out on too much. Regarding jobs, head to the Campus Job Board and you might be able to snag a part time position on there, but I can't promise anything.\n\nOverall, being a smaller school without a big presence of Greek Life, socialization usually comes through your classes, clubs, social media. I've literally directly messaged random people on Instagram who I was mutuals with, and told them I thought they were cool and would like to get to know them as friends. And those people are now some of my closest friends today. Not saying you have to do that, but it's an option if you're so bold. Follow DePaul people as they show up on your social media and start networking from there. \n\nDon't be scared to reach out to someone you think is cool! We're a smaller student body with more emphasis on making friends through your major, interests and other student activities. And my DMs are always open if you want someone to talk to as a friend, so don't hesitate to reach out :)\n\nWelcome to DePaul!",

I guess I didn\u2019t realize how important social life was to me until I actually submitted my intent to attend.",

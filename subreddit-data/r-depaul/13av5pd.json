    "postText": "I agreed to all-gender housing, but I believe the only two dorms where that's available are University Hall and Seton, and they aren't exactly my top choices. It's led me to some questions I wanna get sorted out before the deadline to change my agreement.\n\nMy roommate (also trans) and I mainly agreed to it just because we didn't want the floor to be all-male or all-female for safety and comfort, but everything on the Depaul website on all-gender housing just talks about roommates and suitemates, so I was wondering if all dorms have co-ed floors? And all-gender housing just affects that stuff?\n\nEither way, should my roommate and I stick with all-gender housing anyway? I'm from a rural area, so I just assume that because it's Chicago everyone will be chill about trans people but maybe not lmao. Would it be safer to just stick with all-gender housing? Be honest with me, any input is appreciated :)\n\n(I wanted to just call the housing department but it's outside of office hours hsjdkfs)",

This is just from my experience of being inside the dorms to visit friends and such",

            "comment": "When I graduated in 2015, DePaul had a pretty robust English program with several professors I really liked. I took tons of writing workshops and cool classes like my major authors courses on Beckett and William Blake, was able to publish in Crook &amp; Folly, and went to a number of readings.  Personally, I was happy with my experience. \n\nI'd highly recommend Kathleen Rooney and Mark Turcotte as writing profs. \n\nThat said, I have heard from at least one friend that they also really enjoyed their English program at Loyola. They're probably both good options and Chicago has a great lit scene you can take advantage of either way.",

            "comment": "Depends on what you want.  Check out the faculty profiles on each dept.'s website.  Take note of how many of the tenured/tenure-track professors got their degrees in topics that interest you or teach topics that interest you.  Then check out each University's Course Catalog to see what classes an English major requires.  Are those the sort of classes you making up 40-50% of your undergrad studies?\n\nDePaul's undergrad English program has two concentrations:  Creative Writing &amp; Literary Studies.  Majors choose one concentration, but both concentrations have required major electives that would allow you to study any type of ENG class you like.  \n\nCreative Writing workshops are sometimes cross-listed with graduate courses; so, it's not unusual for an undergrad to take (technically undergrad) classes with the same learning goals and expectations as a graduate workshop.  The English department also has it's own publishing imprint, Big Shoulders Books, which produces a book roughly every year and a half.  These books are produced by students via classes that explore every stage of the publishing process from concept through launch.  ENG majors can get plenty of \"hands on\" experience in publishing through Big Shoulders and other department opportunities.\n\nBoth Lit &amp; Creative Writing undergrads also have the chance to do graduate-level work through the department's distinction program.  Additionally, English majors can participate in a number of combined-degree programs, which allow students to take 3 grad classes during their senior year, which apply to their BA.  If the student chooses to enter the DePaul grad program upon graduation, that translates into roughly 25% of their graduate requirements taken as part of their undergrad degree/tuition.  \n\nSorry that I can't offer any insight on Loyola, but good luck finding the school and program that is right for you.",

            "comment": "Alright, because there's some ignorant responses in this thread ill jump in and explain depauls side and some of what I know. \n\nEnglish is a major that is houses in the school of liberal and social sciences. To be precise their main office is in Arts and Letters 3rd floor. Arts and letters is one of depauls new building and is really nice. We have a lot of students who study English and there are two concentrations. You will also have a lot of elective room to try out other classes and majors. So please remember to take some time to consider a second major or minor. As you'll definitely have room for stuff if you plan it right. \n\nAnother thing to note is the schedule. DePaul is a quarter system. We take 4 classes every 11 weeks starting after labor day. These 4 classes are 16 credits, you do pay for a total of 18, so you can take a 2 credit if you'd like. For example graphic design, game design, fitness, etc all have small 2 credit classes. But on stranded we take 4, not 5. It also takes 194 credits to graduate, so please remember that. \n\nNow when it comes to schedule we start after labor day, whereas loyola starts before as they are on a semester system. Their semester runs until end of August to mid December. We at depaul run from early September to the Tuesday before Thanksgiving. You have a 6 week gap. Then we come back the Monday after the new year and run until roughly the last week of March. Take 5-7 days off depending on the calander year and then come back to go from end of March/ beginning of April to the second week of June. \n\nMany students here prefer the quarter system as we get to take more classes, experience more things, we also have an easier time declaring double majors or minors due to having to complete so many credits. Most minors on standard are 24 credits with few outliers. But some don't, some think its to fast and wish for a semester system which last 15 weeks? I believe. \n\nOur campus is quite different from loyola but I recommend you see both and notice the differences between both. DePaul has a three line train stop. Loyola only has the red. Loyola has more food around it. DePaul doesn't have much food or grocery stores close by. But Lincoln park is often viewed as nicer than rogers park. \n\nDePaul and loyola are both well connected in the city. So I would base your choice off three things. Which campus you like, how much its going to cost you, and whether you want semester or quarter system.",

Most of the kids I know are often first generation or from middle to lower class families. Which isn't bad, we have a lot of resources for first gen students if you are one, I can certainly share more on that. This also isn't to say that loyola might be in the same boat, they might even have some decent staff to help their students. So make sure to check around and find the right fit for you.",

We don't have this massive rich population that you claim. Sure some. Like I see a telsa or few sports cars parked on Kenmore. But that isn't the majority or even a quarter of the student body.",

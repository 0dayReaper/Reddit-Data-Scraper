DePaul has cinespace studios where Chicago PD and Chicago Fire are filmed. We also have two camera vaults and numerous opportunities to work on projects throughout the year. On the down side I feel like a lot of the classes are repetitive and don\u2019t give you a hands on experience that I feel full students need. That being said though there are classes that you can take that do give you those hands on experiences. Plus DePaul gives you a lot of opportunities outside of classes to get that hands on experiences with student films, clubs, etc. hope this helps a bit and feel free to ask any questions if you have any.",

(We\u2019re actually in Chicago right now for a formal visit and tour tomorrow.) I know both are great schools. Would love to have perspective from a current student. \u2026 She loves Chicago; we are based in Texas, about three hours from UT Austin.",

Most of my education was online due to the pandemic and it cost me so much hands on experience which is one of the reasons I chose DePaul. If I were not a pandemic kid, I would absolutely choose DePaul. I just feel like I lost out on so many great experiences due to the pandemic.",

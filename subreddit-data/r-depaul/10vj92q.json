I\u2019m not even sure what quantitative reasoning is so I don\u2019t know what math I need to know. \n\nAny help is appreciated!",

I highly recommend taking it with him. \n\nAlso the course is mainly an excel class. You'll learn to map out some data and then learn how to use excel functions. Not super difficult, but it is time consuming. So if this is a quarter where you have a heavy amount of work to due, maybe save it for a lighter quarter.",

Like some of the quarter I delt with some health issues and struggled to get things in on time or just couldn't comprehend it as quickly as I needed and he was really good about giving me a little more time. Because one thing I learned about this class is to try and break it up a little. \n\nI also struggle to focus and ran into the problem where it didn't make sense at the last second. What helped the most was having a night to step away and come back. Because work that I messed up prior now clicked the next day. \n\nLike honestly i would take every math class he teaches if he taught them all.",

How is career advisement you\u2019ve received? DePaul is my 1st choice but I would be paying about $9K out of pocket. My other choice is North Park University for which I will be paying about $2K out of pocket. Do you feel the program is preparing you to have employment in the field after graduation? Any extra info you could share would be appreciated. Feel free to DM me instead if you feel more comfortable with that.",

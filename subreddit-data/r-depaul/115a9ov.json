We have;\n\n\u2022 All of Autumn Quarter\n\n\u2022 Winter Break (December intersession is optional)\n\n\u2022 Winter Quarter, we have MLK Jr. Day off \n\u2022 Spring Break (1 week)\n\n\u2022 Spring Quarter, we have Good Friday and Memorial Day off \n\n\u2022 Summer Break (optional to take classes)\n\nBut basically, because we only have 10 week academic sessions \u2014 on top of our long winter break \u2014 we have a limited amount of days off within the quarters themselves. Hope that helped!",

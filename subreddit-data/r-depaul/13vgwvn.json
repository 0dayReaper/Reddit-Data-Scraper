    "postText": "Hello , I am a transfer student deciding between Depaul and UIC for CS . In terms of cost I have negotiated my financial aid with depaul to the point that Depaul is now $1,000 cheaper for me than UIC would be. I am most interested in hearing about what kind of internship opportunities/ help CS students receive at depaul . Is it difficult to land an internship? I know that UIC has a guaranteed internship program and this is the only thing holding me back from accepting my offer at Depaul",

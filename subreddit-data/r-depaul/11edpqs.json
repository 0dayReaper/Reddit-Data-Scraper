At cinespace there is a bunch of gear you can borrow and experiment with and there are a lot of opportunities for hands-on experience. So far id say it\u2019s been worth it!",

( it helps me understand the potential job role)\nAnd do you find vacancies where you live or you are looking for further studies? \nIs BFA enough to secure job (i know to secure a job its up-to our own hard work, but yknow, academic and certification wise)",

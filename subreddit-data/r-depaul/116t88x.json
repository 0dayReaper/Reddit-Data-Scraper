            "comment": "Hi,\n\nMcCabe, Centennial, and University Hall are some of the better dorms. Centennial is hard to get into due to it being handicap excessible so its often saves for that. The other one that people like is Ozaname. Ozaname used to be named Clifton-fullerton and was nicknamed hotel Clifton it was so nice. \n\nAs for dorms you dont want, do everything in your power to not end up in Seton. Seton is 100% the worst dorm and often the dorm all the freshman get placed into. So I advice you to immediately apply for housing when the option is available and do everything you can to not end up there.",

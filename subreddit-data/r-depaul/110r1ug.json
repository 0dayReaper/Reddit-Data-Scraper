    "postText": "I'm a freshman considering transferring to DePaul next fall for media &amp; comm. I currently go to North Texas U. and I love it but due to there being so many students attending, the school said they are reserving most of the dorms for freshman, and off-campus apartments are getting more and more expensive due to that too. My rent in an apt. will be $750 with 3 other roommates...keep in mind this is a medium sized college town in north Texas...... I wanted to go to DePaul since highschool but due to financial circumstances I wasn't able to, but now I'm considering it more because I might be paying the same amount in tuition anyway. My main question right now is the cost of room and board. Do most students live in the dorms? Is it common for students to live off-campus? What neighborhoods are most popular/where should I look into?",

Surrounding areas seem to be a little expensive 1500 for a studio or 1 bedroom. Of course getting roommates would help to be around $750 or so.  There\u2019s a Facebook page that shows you subleases and apartments nearby",

Im a commuter from the northern suburb, my roommate used to commute daily until he graduated from a western suburb, my friend used to commute from the northern suburbs, my sibling has commuted from the South and northern suburbs due to moving. I know a ton of other commuters. Its common. Advice, live somewhere north of campus and not over 0.8 miles from a red or purple line station. Also factor in how close a grocery store is, check out depaul housing on Facebook, and you'll be fine",

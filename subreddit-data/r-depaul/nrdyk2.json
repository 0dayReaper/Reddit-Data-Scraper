Even the Uighur genocide (which was recently classified as one by several organizations), on technical grounds, almost doesn't even count (btw, I definitely agree that it is a genocide, now that we know that most of what has come out has been true). So how does this even come close? I can agree it's an apartheid state, for sure, and very well could escalate into genocide, buuut... I think the closest it comes is with the intentional settling of east Jerusalem, which I wouldn't call genocide, but definitely something horrible. Ethnic cleansing to a certain degree.",

                    "comment": "\"Apartheid\"...hmm that's a pretty serious word to throw around so let's unpack it. This \"apartheid\" country is one that's literally set to have an Arab Islamist Party (Ra'am aka United Arab List) as part of the new governing coalition/being part of the governing cabinet. How does that work?\n\nIt is my understanding that for a country/political system to be \"apartheid\" it by definition requires \"domination by one racial group of persons over any other racial group of persons.\" Assuming that's a correct definition, what racial group of persons are the Israeli Palestinian Arabs of the Ra'am aka United Arab List if they're not the same racial group of persons as the Palestinian Arabs living in the West Bank &amp; Gaza? I assumed they were the same group of persons but they can't be if Israel is actually an apartheid country/system.\n\nI'm no expert on the stuff or even well versed in the subject so if I'm wrong here I'm open to being educated by people who know more than I. In fact, I encourage anyone who knows more than me with my amateur perspective on the matter to explain how this is apartheid when it seems to lack a necessary condition to be considered apartheid.\n\nEdit: changed a ? to a .",

The United Nations actually repealed the resolution in 1991. The \u201capartheid\u201d claim is an attempt to turn back the clock to the Soviet era.\n\nThe aim of such propaganda, in addition to delegitimizing the very basis of existence of the State of Israel, is to cynically manipulate the international community and to encourage imposition of an international sanctions regime against Israel modeled on the actions against the former apartheid regime in South Africa. Israel is a multi-racial and multi-colored society, and the Israeli Arab population actively participates in the political process. Israeli Arabs enjoy complete equality and freedom of expression. They elect their own Knesset members and Arab judges serve in the Supreme Court. Israeli Arabs serve as heads of hospital departments, university professors, diplomats, and senior police and army officers. (BTW- if you're following the news, you may know Arab Israeli party joined the coalition aiming to oust Netanyahu. So...)\n\nAnd about the genocide: Israel has never advocated, devised or entertained any plan, design or campaign, systematic or otherwise, to undermine or destroy the Palestinian people, or to act out of revenge or despair.\n\nThat's a tweet from Mark Ruffalo (who is an avid Pro- Palastinian): \"I have reflected &amp; wanted to apologize for posts during the recent Israel/Hamas fighting that suggested Israel is committing \u201cgenocide\u201d. It\u2019s not accurate, it\u2019s inflammatory, disrespectful &amp; is being used to justify antisemitism here &amp; abroad. Now is the time to avoid hyperbole.\"\n\nAnyway, I wish you all the best, may you always feel safe, it's so important! everyone deserves it.",

Generally in a genocide you see the numbers go way down. What is happening to the Palestinians is indisputably not good. There is plenty of blame to go around. Egypt also blockades Gaza, and the Arab world isn\u2019t exactly rushing to support the Palestinians these days. But to call what is happening in Palestine a genocide is an insult to all peoples who have actually experienced it. You are making the word meaningless (which, I expect, is the goal). \n\nIf according to you, ancestral land rights don\u2019t apply, then the Palestinians have no claim. Israel has been a reality since 1948. But of course I know you don\u2019t expect the Palestinians to give up their ancestral rights. Clearly, your objection to ancestral rights only applies to Jews. \n\nI also notice that you, too, don\u2019t deny that in a hypothetical river-to-sea Palestine, the Jews would almost certainly be killed. You mock me for fearing it while strongly implying with your words that, in fact, the Jews deserve genocide / they have it coming. That\u2019s a very, very old argument, predating the conflict in Palestine, and it shows me that you don\u2019t care about helping Palestinians; you care about hating Jews.",

I assume you expect the response to this to be \"the Palestinians\" - but that's revisionist history.\n\nBefore the establishment of the state it was the British, but since they aren't the right complexion for you, lets wash that away for a moment.\n\nThe British came into possession of the land through the defeat &amp; collapse of the Ottomans. Do you mean to say the Turks would be perfectly justified in conquering present day Israel? The Ottoman's themselves were colonizers (they were \"the Ottoman Empire\" after all) who, in part, collapsed due to their efforts to colonize the Balkans. Only towards the twilight years of the Ottoman's (and a stretch at that) do we see the unique Palestinian identity begin to emerge. Before that the most prominent national philosophy at the time was pan-Arabism - everyone all part of... the empire.\n\nThe Ottomans were an extension of the Caliphate, colonizers who emerged out of the peninsula and took the land from the Byzantines, who themselves were an evolution of the Romans, who colonized Jerusalem from... The Jews! (And BTW, up through the Ottoman Empire, Jews were living in Israel - as second class citizens.)\n\nSo I'll return the question to you and say whos land was it for centuries before? Because the answer certainly isn't as clear as you're making it seem. At best it's colonizers all the way down, and you seem to be saying Jews no longer have a claim because they were kicked out and/or subjugated (ie. colonized) for so long that we should erase their connection.\n\nWhich leads us to the dangerous fallacy you present:\n\n&gt;Yes, they have a connection to the land, but the reality is that the connection had been attenuated by time.\n\nSo it's fine and dandy for Jews to be dispossessed of the land, so much so that they erode all connection to the land in spite of a constant second class citizen status in the land. In this case, colonization is fine - as long as it lasts for a long time.\n\n&gt;The modern state of Israel is no longer a new thing, and now has the benefit of time, but taking land by force and turning Palestinians into second class citizens in their own homeland is wrong\n\nAnd this one is bad.\n\nSo let me ask you this: Definitely Palestinians are entitled to self determination. But practically speaking you just said, in reference to Jews, that over time this claim attenuates. How long does that take? How long did it take for the Arab residents to become \"naturalized\" and no longer colonizers of the Byzantines. How long did the Jews have to be second class citizens in order for their claims to attenuate? How long will it take Israel to \"naturalize\" and the Palestinian claim attenuate?\n\nEdit: Grammar",

The territorial rights weren't neglected, the Jews were there, and they were second class citizens. There was \\*also\\* a diaspora. What would \"claiming territorial rights\" look like under colonial Ottomans rule? So your argument is that because the Jews were beaten down so firmly, because they were striped of land and rights so completely, and had no ways to express their territorial rights... therefore they abdicate any claim to the land? You're blaming the colonized for... being colonized... while also claiming colonization is bad. \n\n Which brings me back to this point:\n\n&gt;In 1947 it was the Zionists who accepted the UN two-state partition plan, and the Arabs who rejected it.\n\nThe very first effort was cohabitation. Your \"colonizers\" didn't want sole possession of the land. They \\*wanted\\* a homeland, side by side with an Arab/Palestinian state. That was outright rejected by the Arabs. In that moment they refused to accept Jews as their neighbors. \n\nSo now let's take your words:\n\n&gt;taking land by force and turning Palestinians into second class citizens in their own homeland is wrong, and it should surprise no one that displaced, dispossessed people resort to asymmetrical tactics against a colonizer.\n\nReplace Palestinian with Jews and tell me how that reads. \n\nSo what you're saying is you are fine with Palestinians reasserting the rights they gained to the land through colonial expansion, but when Jews don't want to be second-class citizens in their homeland that is unacceptable.",

I was merely pointing out that this position is factually inaccurate. The Al-aqsa mosque is literally built on a mountain top that was built by a Jew. There is Hebrew carved into the walls and stone. The Dead Sea scrolls had words written on them that were read in synagogues around the world for centuries before the scrolls we discovered. My point being, saying \"Israel just showed up\" ignores the long \\*and persistent\\* legacy of Jewish history in Israel, and whitewashes the fact that at a point (in fact at many points) it was the Jews who were being colonized. None of this denies Palestinian heritage, or a right to self determination there. But if anyone wants peace we are going to have to reconcile that both have claims. The core premise of anti-zionism is that Jews do not have a right to their homeland.\n\nTo your final point - yes. I agree that both have claim to the land, and should live side by side. This is why I balk at people calling Israel a \"colonialist entity\" because implicit in that is saying that one of two things are true: The word is being used wrong, or Israel, and the Jews, are colonizers and thus have no right to the land (which is historically and demonstrably false). If you think that Zionism and being Pro-Palestinian are mutually exclusive, you have had zionism defined for you wrong (likely by an anti-zionist).\n\nTo your other points: The genetic debate is a poor one, and not one that I was making. I don't believe genetic purity is what gives people entitlement to a piece of land. In some cases, like with white colonial efforts, it makes the contrast of who occupied the land much more obvious. But this is not that case. This is a case of a shared genetic history that forked at a certain point. \n\nThe cultural argument is a separate one, but more closely related to issues of \"homeland\". \"Hebrews\" weren't the first in the land, sure. (we can just ignore the fact that using the word \"Hebrews\" in the first place is done deliberately to create a false break in the cultural heritage by people who want to refute the claims.) So yes, there were other cultures. But the Temple Mount means today the very same thing that it did to Jews way back when. The cultural connection to the land, truly, spans thousands of years. I do not intend to diminish the Palestinian identity, but it is one that is (relative to the Jewish identity) a very new one. Palestinian nationalism only emerged around the turn of the 20th century. Most of the enlightenment philosophical discourse for the Ottoman Empire was around Pan-arabism - the idea of a shared ethnic heritage. Before that it was Islamism (a shared religious heritage). Neither of these were identities unique to present-day Israel and spanned an area much larger. Now the Palestinians see themselves as a distinct ethnic and national group, but this was - at most - an evolution of the last 120-130 years. Again, this doesn't mean they aren't entitled to a homeland, but revising history to say \"Oh Palestinians are the Philistines of old\" just isn't true, unless you know of Palestinians who speak Philistine and worship Ba'al.",

I have no doubt that you may have a visceral reaction to it, and are emotionally offended by it. But to tell me that their is some rational or logical basis for it - to me, based on the evidence provided - is fruitless. \n\nThe reason why this is important is because people are claiming any criticism of the Israeli government (and there are countless Israeli Jews who are critical of the government, mind you) is Anti-Semitic. Why? Because it\u2019s Anti-Zionist. And to me that makes no sense, and comes off as a token to silence the critics.",

I am not sure this would fly in most places. \n\nAll of this really comes down to what price you are willing to pay for self determination.

Saying the Jews deserved the Holocaust or equating 250 Palestinians dead in 4000 airstrikes to *the Holocaust* is not legitimate criticism. Spamming \"Free Palestine!\" to every Jew everywhere regardless of context and saying Jews drink child blood is not a criticism of Israel. Saying Jews deserve to be attacked in hate crimes in the US and Europe or otherwise those attacks are understandable or not a big deal is not criticism of Israel. Yet this is THE BULK of the rhetoric on this, social media sites, and college campuses, and people who call this out get attacked as false accusers of antisemitism and bots, while even those who otherwise condemn antisemitism will turn a gaping blind eye to this shit.

Those really are not productive for anything - and actually counterproductive to the actual Palestinian cause. For me personally, I am trying to work towards a more just society and a more just world. And if I see a government act against that principle, then I will call it out. But it is definitely not okay to personally attack people for their race, gender, ethnicity, religion, etc.",

As much as I defend Israel, I recognize Israel does a ton of stuff that is wrong that should be called out. Bibi is finally getting ousted, the new PM is pretty right wing, but his coalition consists of left wingers and an Arab party, they formed only to remove Bibi, so I dont know that he will be able to get things done the way he wants, and I'm hoping we have a government that wont turn a blind eye to the status quo when it comes to treatment of Palestinians",

Unfortunately I have noticed theres not much information about the honors dorms, so could anyone tell me how do they work? Is it possible to get a single suite, or do I have to live with more than 1 person?",

            "comment": "DePaul Honors here. The Honors LLC is housed in Ozanam Hall (Oz), which features 'Jack &amp; Jill' style suites. This means you will have one roommate that you share a bedroom with, as well as a bathroom that you share between you, your roommate, and two other suitemates who are connected to you via the bathroom/common area. Generally, students don't get to choose their roommate when they choose the Honors LLC. This is for a number of reasons, including making sure only Honors students are on the Honors floor. If you are interested in learning about the possibility of having a single suite in Oz, I would recommend you reach out to housing at [Housing@depaul.edu](mailto:Housing@depaul.edu), but that is generally not an option in the Honors LLC. If you would like to learn more, feel free to email Honors at [honorsprogram@depaul.edu](mailto:honorsprogram@depaul.edu).",

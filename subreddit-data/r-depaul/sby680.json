    "postText": "So I probably sound like a total loser, but after transferring here from community college as a Junior, and being here about a quarter so far, I feel like it's really tough to make friends here.  My on-campus apartment is not social at all, and very few people have ever reached out to me to hang out.  I have put myself out a lot and made like three friends outside of my two roommates, but I just don't have a solid social circle.  What did some of you guys do to make friends?  I'm also in two clubs, but nothing has materialized in those either.  \n\nI also love to party on the weekends, but I just don't know where they are, or know anyone who knows or organizes them.  My girlfriend goes to UIUC, and I feel like I'm better friends with her group than the people I've met here.  Am I just doing something wrong?  Am I impatient? Any advice for a transfer student like me to find a solid social circle?  Thank you!",

Maybe it is like that at most colleges but DePaul has it worse given that so many people do not live in the dorms unlike other colleges",

            "comment": "DePaul's film program is fairly hands-on. I was mostly on the post-production side, but all of my classes, especially those at Cinespace, were very interactive and project based. For the most part, my professors were well-connected in the film industry and more than happy to share experiences and advice. They were also pretty responsive outside of class during the week. DePaul has a lot of equipment: cameras, lighting, etc. They have some at \"The Cage\" in the Loop Campus and a lot of more advanced equipment at Cinespace. It is easy to get access to if you are doing something for school; otherwise, there are a ton of hoops to jump through and it isn't really worth it. You can't use the equipment for anything that you would profit from either which is kinda annoying. There are a ton of internships around Chicago, but it is pretty much up to you to find them. DePaul uses a site called Handshake that has a lot of them posted, but you would be responsible for getting hired and then applying to get credit.",

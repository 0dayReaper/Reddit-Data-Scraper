    "postText": "I need to see if anyone feels the same way here, especially other students that grew up as low-income and a minority.\n\nFor the love of god I cannot continue to stand these goddamn socialists. How many times are they going to preach to you while sipping their Whole Foods coffee in one hand and Mac Book pros in the other?\n\nHow the hell can someone like you, who sits their in LuLuLemon's, while I'm making lemonade from thrift, able to understand the struggle like me? The amount of people who have started to preach about how I'm not paying enough attention to class issues and perpetuating inequality as a middle-classer if fucking ridiculous.\n\nI'm not middle class. I'm poor. I work two jobs to support my family and make just enough money for my bills and food. Why do people assume I'm some kind of stuck up elitist? I'm literally the person they 'think' about when they preach and criticize me on campus.\n\nThen don't get me started on the folks that go on their study abroad trips. \"Oh why don't you go to a third world country and help out instead of living comfortably in the first world while class struggle occurs\"\n\nFFS, this take on study abroad is the most hypocritical shit because DePaul does *not* cover all expenses. Do you understand what studying abroad means? It means I have to sacrifice an income I don't have, stop working, and put my family at risk.\n\nWhat kind of 'poor person', the person that the vincentian mission upholds--what kind of poor folk could ever afford that? Yet you talk to me about what poor people must probably go through, and how you're against classism?\n\nSome people in my major are going on a study abroad for the December term, and I was criticized for not putting the money I didn't have to help out and experience global inequality. People assume I'm not poor, and people assume that I'm the enemy for not caring.\n\nI'm not vocal or an activist **because poor, working people can't afford to do something like that**\n\nI don't ever want to hear from these folks again\n\nidk if you guys have any similar experiences, but the disconnect form these guys is so real and just infuriating",

I have observed a more and more disconnect between social liberalism and its liberal economic counterpart when discussing it with self described modern socialists and liberals. You would think these concepts would be more intertwined, but there is often time a elitism the social liberals have and they local down on socialist/liberal economic principals and ideologies. I think its part of the reason why Trump's populist message resonated with poor working white people. Modern liberalism wants to rid itself of socialist economic thought. \n\nNoam Chomsky spoke a bit about the elitism of social/\"intellectual\" liberals in his book *Understanding Power*: \n&gt;\"They largely function as a distinct class, and so distinguish themselves by using language inaccessible to people outside the academy, with more or less deliberately exclusionary effects. In Chomsky's view there is little reason to believe that academics are more inclined to engage in profound thought than other members of society and that the designation \"intellectual\" obscures the truth of the intellectual division of labour: \"These are funny words actually, I mean being an 'intellectual' has almost nothing to do with working with your mind; these are two different things. My suspicion is that plenty of people in the crafts, auto mechanics and so on, probably do as much or more intellectual work as people in the universities. There are plenty of areas in academia where what's called 'scholarly' work is just clerical work, and I don't think clerical work's more challenging than fixing an automobile engine\u2014in fact, I think the opposite.... So if by 'intellectual' you mean people who are using their minds, then it's all over society\" ",

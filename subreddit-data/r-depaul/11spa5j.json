Rolling basis means, if they have space you would be considered. Unless you are very exceptional from their batch of applied students, have expectations for a wait list at best, as there are many other wait listed candidates who get priority for admission also",

The top students in the pool already got their acceptance in end Feb or early March. Hence, No one can tell what you need, to be exceptional or even good.\n\nAlso if you have applied for fall term then March is a little late but not too late, but if you applied for winter term, then you are early and will have an upper hand.",

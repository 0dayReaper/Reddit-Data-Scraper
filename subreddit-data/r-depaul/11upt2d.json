    "postText": "I applied to the Summer 2023 Quarter as a grad student and got accepted. Due to some issues, I wanted to defer to Fall 2023 session, but on the admissions portal, I accidentally selected 'Winter 2024' instead, and now it won't let me change. As per DePaul's policy, only one deferral is allowed per application, meaning that now I can either enroll in that quarter (Winter 2024) or withdraw my application (and reapply as a graduate readmit, which is a whole another process). \n\nCan anyone please advise me what to do without having to reapply as a graduate readmit? A bit desperate for help here. Thanks in advance :')\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE: I emailed the respective college to ask if preponement of admission was possible, and they said that they can surely do that. Thank you to everyone who responded! :)",

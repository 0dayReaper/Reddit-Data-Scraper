However after seeing about recent crime and gun violence in Chicago I've been worried. I'll be living in the McKinley Park area. What are your all's thoughts on safety? What should I look out for, what is safe, etc? Like I said, I've never been to Chicago.",

If you\u2019re walking with headphones on looking straight down at your phone, you\u2019re asking someone to snatch your phone. Although I see people do that all the time, they never get robbed. So even if you are not paying attention still like very safe.",

I do take a class that ends 9pm almost every quarter, and walking back home after getting off the train around that time has been safe for me.",

    "postText": "Hello!!\n\nI am a prospective student in DePaul's Sustainable Urban Development MA. I am very interested in careers related to urban green space (botanic gardens, parks), urban agriculture and food systems, and city planning.\n\nI like the sounds of DePaul's program, but would love to hear from any current grad students about their experience at DePaul, any concerns over the budget deficit, and also weighing the choice between getting an MA or an MS in a similar program.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI currently work in politics and am looking for a career shift, so any insight from current grad students would be appreciated!!

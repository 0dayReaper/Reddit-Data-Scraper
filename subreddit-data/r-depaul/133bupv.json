            "comment": "For the first term your schedule will likely be:\n\nCSC 241\nDiscover Chicago or Explore Chicago\nDiscrete Math 1\nComp and Rhetoric \n\nIf you did discover Chicago which I believe takes place in the summer, it frees you up for an elective. I recommend taking CSC 281, which is Java workshop. I promise if you take this you\u2019ll pass Data Structure (CSC 300) with flying colors when you take it in the Spring. People fail CSC 300 because they don\u2019t have Java experience, once you know the language the content isn\u2019t very difficult. 281 is usually offered in the winter quarter I highly recommend it and honestly it should be required.",

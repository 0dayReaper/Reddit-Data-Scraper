I am just wondering if this is a protocol or something I've just managed to avoid because I was asked today while with my sister (who is also a DePaul student) and the whole interaction just felt off and kinda made us feel a little singled out but I want to ask if anyone has had a similar experience before I feel a certain way about it or if everyone has been IDed. I also have taken a couple of classes here without this happening and I've never had it happen for any other building on both campuses.",

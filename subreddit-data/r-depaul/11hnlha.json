The website only has so much info u kno?\n\nI have already crossed off Corcoran and Seton from my list-- I went to an all boys boarding school with no AC and a communal bathroom for a few years, last thing I want is more of that experience, yuck.

Plus, the bathrooms are more so private and less communal. It\u2019s one bathroom and you share with 2 or 3 other rooms (lowkey forgot) but you can lock the door to shower and use the bathroom\u2026",

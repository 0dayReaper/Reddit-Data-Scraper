    "postText": "I am considering changing my major from accounting to MIS and I have some questions for anyone who is currently in the program or has been through the program already. Here are my questions:\n\n\\- is the program well respected? in comparison to the accounting program?\n\n\\- what kind of internships have DePaul MIS students gotten?\n\n\\- what kind of employment opportunities exist for DePaul MIS majors after graduating? Companies? Job titles?\n\n\\- and if I am trying to get into software development, will this program help me? or would I be better off getting a different degree while teaching myself to code outside of school?",

            "comment": "MIS would be a good major if you want to go into a business systems analyst, technical project manager, or product owner role. It is a good major that will give you access to in-demand jobs. If you want to get an SWE job I would recommend going CS since it will give you a better foundation in data structures and algorithms and programming.  You could become an SWE as an MIS major, but it would require a large amount of self-study to be a competent programmer. I graduated with a degree in information systems, which is basically the same thing as MIS. My job title is Software Engineer in Test. The most helpful classes I took in undergrad were elective CS classes like Data Structures and Algorithms.",

You have a lot of options and opportunities as an MIS major. Great program, much better than UIC's IDS program (where I transferred from) IMO.",

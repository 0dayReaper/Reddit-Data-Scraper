Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and it's wonderful that we have platforms like Reddit to share these perspectives freely. However, a respectful tone facilitates healthy discussions, promoting a more enriching exchange of ideas. Rather than resorting to profanity and demands for content removal, I believe we could engage in a more constructive dialogue.\r  \n\r  \nAs a creator, my primary objective is not to enforce a particular viewpoint, but to present theories, stimulate conversations, and foster an environment that encourages intellectual curiosity. As a member of this map-focused subreddit, I'm sure we share a deep appreciation for maps and the stories they can tell. My video is centered around three different types of maps, each one providing a unique lens through which we can examine the world. It's through these lenses that we can begin to question, explore, and understand our world in new and exciting ways.\r  \n\r  \nIt's perfectly okay to disagree with the theory presented in the video; in fact, it's through such disagreements that we often make the most profound discoveries. Yet, it's equally important to maintain a level of respect for the intellectual pursuits of others. In future, I'd welcome your thoughts and critiques on the content, and maybe we could engage in a more positive and insightful discussion. The beauty of maps and geographical theories is that they always leave room for exploration and debate. Let's take advantage of that.\r  \n\r  \nBest,\n\nDavid Stig Hansen",

Entiendo que las teor\u00edas que present\u00e9 podr\u00edan parecer poco convencionales, y es completamente normal que tengas opiniones diferentes. Sin embargo, en lugar de recurrir a ataques personales como \"Ud. es loco\", podr\u00eda ser m\u00e1s productivo centrarnos en los argumentos y las ideas en s\u00ed mismas.\r  \n\r  \nEsto nos lleva al concepto de 'Ad Hominem', un t\u00e9rmino que se usa en la l\u00f3gica y la ret\u00f3rica para describir un tipo de falacia en el que se ataca a la persona que presenta un argumento en lugar de al argumento mismo. Al decir \"Ud. es loco\", estamos desvi\u00e1ndonos de la discusi\u00f3n sobre las teor\u00edas en el video y entrando en el territorio de los ataques personales, lo cual no contribuye de manera constructiva a la conversaci\u00f3n.\r  \n\r  \nNuestro objetivo aqu\u00ed, en este subreddit enfocado en mapas, debe ser fomentar un ambiente de respeto mutuo y aprendizaje colectivo. Como alguien que tiene un amor profundo por los mapas, valoro cada oportunidad para explorar diferentes perspectivas y estimular el pensamiento cr\u00edtico. Podemos aprender mucho m\u00e1s juntos si nos centramos en el contenido y en los argumentos presentados, en lugar de recurrir a ataques personales. Te invito a compartir tus pensamientos sobre las teor\u00edas presentadas en el video de una manera constructiva y respetuosa.\r  \n\r  \nCon los mejores deseos,  \nDavid Stig Hansen",

He explores intriguing theories surrounding the origin of these enigmatic stone structures - two ancient walls running across Willow Creek that contribute to shaping the Continental Divide. While some argue they are natural formations - volcanic dikes sculpted by millennia of geological processes - others propose a more fantastical theory, suggesting these walls were engineered by ancient giants. Join him as he examines these theories, journeying through geology, history, and folklore, to unravel the secrets of these fascinating structures that have both physically and imaginatively shaped the USA's Continental Divide. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD3fL22k9yw",

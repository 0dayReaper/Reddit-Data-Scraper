People in developed countries and countries before the industrial revolution basically had the same number of children reaching adulthood per family.\n\nThe problem is that as a place gets more developed they don't compensate for the lower death rate and still have the same number of kids which means 4 or 5 kids will reach adulthood instead of 2 or 3. Look at the demographic transition model if you want more info.",

When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds, pretty standard really. At the age of 12 I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum, it's breathtaking, I suggest you try it.\n\nMy father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink, he would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Some times he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy, the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament.",

Generally just don\u2019t be an idiot in 2nd &amp; 3rd World Countries (flashing money around, looking to buy drugs, etc) and you\u2019ll generally be fine. I would be extra careful in some of the poorer countries like Sierra Leone from what I\u2019ve been told, but again poor people aren\u2019t dangerous. Ghana and Nigeria were both great, everyone was super welcoming. The media just likes to pretends poor people are dangerous the more you travel that opinion changes, I once spent a night in a random persons Favela in Brazil and I\u2019ve honestly never felt safer. I also woke up with a Chicken on my head, which was a hilarious experience. Hahah. \n\nIt\u2019s funny the more time you spend in Africa the more you realize things like bribes are just a daily occurrence and it almost becomes second nature, like paying a toll, it\u2019s not a big issue after awhile. East Africa is AMAZING as well (Kenya, Tanzania, eta). Honestly the most threatened I ever felt in Africa was around a bunch of sketchy white Zephyrs in a poor neighbourhood in Cape Town.",

Travelling from place to place inside lots of African countries is so arduous. You're at the whims of private drivers, bad vehicles, bad roads, absent roads, no lighting on roads, no speed limits, no overnight accommodation at all on long trips. It sometimes feels like your life is at risk just by travelling Point A to Point B. \n\nBut it still contains some of the most gorgeous and untouched land on the planet.\n\nThat being said, Africa now isn't Africa 20 years ago. Internal conflict has been on a *massive* decline. A lot of countries are becoming wealthier and safer leading them to be able to build proper infrastructure without fear of it being torn apart or abandoned. And as much as it pains a lot of redditors, Chinese investment has been pouring in, which has allowed some places to make leaps and bounds in a relatively short amount of time.",

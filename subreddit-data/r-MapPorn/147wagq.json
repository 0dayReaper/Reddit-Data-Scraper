This version comes from the ,,Saargro\u00dfstadtbrille\" which was a regional satirical newspaper. So one can argue that these are not really real territorial claims but an exaggeration for the German expansionist ideas at the beginning of WW1.\n\nBut the story doesn't end there. Some of those expansionists liked the map so much, that they published it themselves as real German propaganda.\n\nAnd the story is still not over. The Americans later picked up on the map and used it as propaganda to for the war against the Germans themselves.\n\nSo one can say this map is a joke, turned real propaganda, turned counter propaganda.\n\n[Here](https://www.yumpu.com/de/document/read/65279702/saargeschichten-end-219) is a magazine that I found while researching about the map. It has an article about the history of \"Landwehrmann Kutscke\". (In German obviously.)",

The one for the Entente victory was on the front side and the one for the German victory was on the backside.\n\nTaken together I think it should be pretty clear that these were initially made as satire as the territorial changes are utterly ridiculous but over time radicals used these these extremes to get support for their respective side in the war effort.",

Hypothetically, Dowager Empress Vicky becomes Victoria II when Queen Victoria dies in January 1901.  Victoria II, assuming she died later that year as she did historically, would have had a reign of less than a year.  Would the UK have accepted the German Emperor / King of Prussia as King of the United Kingdom as well?  I'd say probably not, but then again this scenario also removes Albert (the future Edward VII) from the equation to some extent, which may have changed Wilhelm's attitude a bit.\n\nBut then of course there's the whole question of whether Vicky would have ended up marrying Frederick III in the first place if she was the heir apparent.  Likely not, and therefore Wilhelm II is never born.",

For example, the union of Scotland and England into the United Kingdom happened over a hundred years after the union of the crowns. Before that, they retained separate statehood and separate parliaments.\n\nAn example of a personal union today would be the 15 Commonwealth realms that share the British monarch as head of state. In a process beginning with Canadian Confederation in 1867 and culminating in the Statute of Westminster in 1931, the various self-governing Dominions of the British Empire were spun off as separate states vested in the same person.\n\nThe Crown of Canada is therefore distinct from the Crown of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (and the Crown of Australia and the Crown of New Zealand and so on). Charles, the individual, acts as the King of Canada in relation to Canada, the King of Australia in relation to Australia, and so on.\n\nThis is analogous to someone sitting on the board of two or more organizations; as a board member for organization A, you must do what is best for organization A, whereas as a board member for organization B, you must do what is best for organization B and so on. If a conflict arose between two of those organizations, it would create a conflict of interest. Likewise, if a conflict arose between two countries in a personal union, one of them would likely name a new monarch or eliminate the monarchy entirely.\n\nAlthough these states agree to maintain the same monarch, it is not necessarily automatic. When Britain updated her succession laws, Canada and the other states had to do so separately through their own parliaments as well. If Canada had not updated her Succession Act, for example, the Crown of Canada could eventually pass to a male heir while the Crown of Great Britain and Northern Ireland passed to his older sister. This would end the personal union without having any effect whatsoever on the independence or constitutional status of either country.\n\nAs a final illustration, if Great Britain voted to ditch the monarchy and become a republic tomorrow, Canada would still be a monarchy.",

So he never existed.\n\nEven more interesting is this map. This version comes from the ,,Saargro\u00dfstadtbrille\" which was a regional satirical newspaper. So one can argue that these are not really real territorial claims but an exaggeration for the German expansionist ideas at the beginning of WW1.\n\nBut the story doesn't end there. Some of those expansionists liked the map so much, that they published it themselves as real German propaganda.\n\nAnd the story is still not over. The Americans later picked up on the map and used it as propaganda to for the war against the Germans themselves.\n\nSo one can say this map is a joke, turned real propaganda, turned counter propaganda.\n\n[Here](https://www.yumpu.com/de/document/read/65279702/saargeschichten-end-219) is a magazine that I found while researching about the map. It has an article about the history of \"Landwehrmann Kutschke\". (In German obviously.)",

It gained momentum there, as you said, which in turn caused critical acclaim by more appeasing parties.\n\nIn the Berlin State Library you can find an essay, critically commenting this exact map in a contemprary source: \"Was bringt uns der Krieg?\" (\"What's the benefit of the war?\") from \"Hauptprediger O.

We do not know at all whether the political blessing of this war will lead to changes in our favor.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What would we want with the Belgians, French and Russians in Germany anyway? We can only reasonably hope that strong guarantees for a lasting peace can be agreed on.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Since a more powerful Germany seems to be the prerequisite for this, we want it so strongly that we can keep the peace because we want to, and that those who do not want to are forced to peace.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, we all know how it ended.",

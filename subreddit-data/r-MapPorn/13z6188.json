As Armenians were expulsed from Kars Oblast during succession wars after ww1 the empty oblast was repopulated by these Turks and Kurds leaving as Armenian gerilla h\u0131nchak dashnak expulsed them. But again it didnt happen as a systematic cleansing. For example the last remenants were expulsed in 90s during karabakh conlifct to Azerbaijan. The descendents in turkey mostly live in Kars and Igd\u0131r while there is also some villages in Kurdish provinces of Turkey. Like in Van for example",

You are showing aggressive behavior towards me because my opinions does not fit to your narrow point of view.\n\nI briefly looked at your profile and I know the reason behind your aggressive behavior. You have a pro-Israeli stand, and you think I point out the similarity between removal of non-Armenian ethnicities from Armenia and the \"population engineering\" by the Israeli Government.\n\nHere is what I believe. I believe \"right\" is objective, but I also believe that condemning the past actions towards yourself and doing the same towards the others is hypocrisy.",

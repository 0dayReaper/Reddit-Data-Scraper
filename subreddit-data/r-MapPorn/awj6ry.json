Now bands may not play India, China, Russia, or South Africa very often, but if there is a big international act in those areas, there's a good chance it's a metal band (or at least hard rock). Metallica, Megadeth, Maiden, GnR, etc. have all played those places in recent years. Besides like the very biggest pop artists, metal seems to have the biggest global appeal and local scenes.\n\nAnd most metal bands tour relentlessly becasue they don't make much on album or digital sales/streaming. So they have to play everywhere they can and live off of ticket and merch sales. So if they skip your city, they most likely will come back around in 6 months and hit all the places they missed last tour.",

Trying to establish a business relationship with a possibly shady promoter in a foreign country, where you don\u2019t know the legal system or have any existing connection, is extremely difficult.\n\nThis is why you see huge pop bands playing all over the world, but not many other American artists. An indie label is going to have a very hard time ensuring the Russian\u2019s don\u2019t take the whole profit. LiveNation can push back and keep the vig to a reasonable percentage...and kickbacks are probably tax deductible for them.",

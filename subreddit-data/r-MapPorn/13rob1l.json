This is also why he plays the rustic country bumpkin - it appeals to Russian nationalists' stereotypes of Belarussians and so means there's no political pressure on Putin to punish him.",

And especially when they went with the Spanish Civil War intervention in Syria. I was arguing they should have stepped up in 2011 when the war started. Since they've had that naval base there for so long. But I don't think they were ready for primetime quite yet.\n\n(Not suggesting Russia is doing any kind of ethnic cleansing, mind you. Just that they're following the \"how to piece back together some remnants of your lost empire\" side of the playbook. )\n\nIn fact, I was curious of an outcome like this when Putin announced plans to heavily invest in reinvigorating the Russian military in the late 00s. That was the first step. Once you bless the military-industiral-complex...war is inevitable.\n\nThe west continuing to try and build missile systems 'aimed at Iran' and expanding NATO/EU into the (former) Russian sphere (not wholly discounting Russia's own covert anti-NATO work in response) certainly didn't work to cool down tensions in the region though.",

There are *also* NATO bases, which are jointly controlled by NATO command and have their own lease/permit structure, which some Americans are stationed at (but far fewer). The same goes there, but the answering party is different.\n\nIf Lukashenko did the same to Putin, either he would die of \"mysterious circumstances\" or thousands of Belarussians would do it for him (once the Russian armaments ensuring his livelihood were removed).",

Some form of loose cooperation does still exist for some of these countries currently, but itis worth pointing out that Algieria not only actively went separate ways from nato after gaining freedom from France but it even aligned itself with the Soviets during the cold war. At no point were countries militarily forced into an alliance like Russia threatens Belarus all the time, and many members were clamoring, begging and reforming to have a chance at getting approved.",

Many other countries would probably follow suit, so as to *not* end up in a situation similar to Belarus&lt;-&gt;Russia.\n\nThis whole idea that the US is a warmongering superstate pulling the strings of other countries is *literally* USSR propaganda that has somehow completely inverted so many facts it boggles my mind. The simplest example being that the US \"created\" NATO to control Europe, despite the fact that it was actually an expansion of two previous European anti-Soviet alliances (Dunkirk and Benelux) and the forming parties specifically *requested* the US join, against US interests; and it's never once had an American commander at the helm. Or the idea that the US somehow forced itself into the world currency status despite that just being a natural outgrowth of having a massive economy that everyone trades with (like how the Euro now is becoming a strong reserve currency)..",

Poland is readying itself up to have that option, but that'd come in the late 20s-early 30s).",

Their industrial capacity is lacklustre to begin with, and thats ignoring the obvious fact a fuck ton of stuff is sanctioned that they need to produce equipment. \n\n&gt;Unlike Russia, Ukriane relies support for NATO to stand.Ukriane is getting more and more equipment but not on the scale of Russia. So in a war of attrition, Russia would easily win.\n\nRight, which just so happens to have a fuck ton more industrial capacity than Russia does. The EU and US have an industrial capacity of 9.5 trillion USD, meanwhile Russia is at 1.3 trillion USD. Ignoring the other point that in 2022, those countries exported 8x more arms than Russia did.",

A Russian can just walk Into a store and buy 13th gen I9 or Rtx 4090. Cost are elevated and that's it.  And that's Civillians. Military has no problem getting tech.\n\nI mean, the numerous articles about shortages in manufacturing seem to disagree with you.. \n\n&gt;This war is also not being fought with 100% modern tech. BMP, BTR, T90, T72, Artillery , SPA are primary equipment and producing them doesn't require alot of modern tech. Russia can keep pumping and dumping then indefinitely.\n\nSo why are they using Cold War tanks, sir?\n\n&gt;Let me dumb it down for you. If my friend is getting insolvent, I can provide money and assistance. That money and assistance can only be limited by my earning capacity and that my way of life isn't affected to much due to my handout. I won't be giving all my salary to my friend. I will give enough that my day to day activities aren't affected much  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Same is the case of Ukraine.\n\nYou don't need to ''dumb it down for me'' - you need to understand context.\n\nThe west has given Ukraine a total of about 150 billion USD. That is 2 years of Russia's total military budget. \n\nTo the EU+US+UK, what we have given Ukraine is the equivalent of 0.3% of our annual GDP. Sure, support might not carry on forever, but in terms of your friend analogy you can afford to pay your friend for the rest of your life when you're earning 150k a year and giving them 450 dollars of it.",

He could not have designed it to be more misleading in a pro-Russian fashion while still technically being able to argue pedantically that the map is accurate from a pro-Ukrainian perspective.\n\n[This is astroturfing propaganda.](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/tactics-of-disinformation_508.pdf) Likely part of a larger campaign designed to emphasize the idea that Crimea is naturally part of Russia via many unrelated posts and posters, which reinforces the legitimacy of the proposition in the minds of unwary Redditors. The point is to repeat the same idea subtly in many different places so that the targeted individuals never realize that they are being targeted by propaganda.\n\nRight now, the Russians are preparing to either defend Crimea or to negotiate a ceasefire that may involve pressure to give up their claims to Crimea. So literally right this second, reinforcing that claim is one of their most important propaganda objectives, and OP's map seems perfectly crafted to support that objective. Given OP's nearly non-existent prior post history and how the subtly pro-Russian distortions of this map just so happen to perfectly serve the most pressing Russian propaganda need of the moment, it is reasonable to dismiss this entire post as astroturfing.",

Since Russia cannot allow that to happen, their only recourse is indefinite occupation (since allowing Ukraine into NATO while they are being occupied by another nation would compel the other members of NATO to come to their defense). I imagine this is why they annexed more territory than the majority Russian areas, so that the Ukrainian government would never let those areas go in the interests of joining those Western institutions (like they might for Crimea, Donetsk, and Lugansk).",

It was a much greater allocation of forces than 10%.  Akin to how the US invaded Iraq (2003) with half a million personnel, despite having 1.3 million active troops +0.8 million civilians part of the DoD.  The US invasion of Iraq didn\u2019t take up 1/3 or 1/4 of US armed forces.  It practically took up all of it, in the context of forces directly used in operations.\n\nTo add a bit more, the US has around 200,000 infantry personnel (iirc, correct me if wrong; including Army, Marines, and National Guard).  And practically all of them fought in Iraq.  I haven\u2019t done much reading on the Russian order of battle myself, both of these next claims are from word of mouth.  The number I keep hearing for Russian expeditionary elements being around ~300,000, combat and support elements.  It should be noted that Russia does have a slightly more infantry per percentage of total personnel than the US.\n\nAlso signaling u/griffery1999 \u2018cuz I couldn\u2019t choose who to comment under.",

Really disappointingly so in the current information environment, where Russian propaganda flows freely.\n\nI see two enormous problems:\n\n- **Crimea, Moldova, and pre-2022 occupied territories in the Donbas are misleadingly colored.** The map colors the territories in Ukraine and Moldova that were illegally occupied before 2022 by Russia as if they are the same as indisputably Russian territory like Rostov. Although the map accurately shows the officially recognized international border as distinct from the Russian-claimed border, that detail is extremely easy to miss compared to the colors of the regions and requires the audience to carefully read the legend to decipher the true status of Crimea.\n- **Using the Russian names for territory the Russian military seized illegally by force.**  Using the Russian names is a tacit endorsement of Russia's illegal annexation of Ukrainian territory in 2014, and only strengthens the false impression given by the color scheme that Crimea is part of Russia. The Russian military forced the Crimean parliament to call a referendum at gun point, and also forced them to exclude any options in the referendum that would have kept Crimea in Ukraine. Then, they systematically drove out any pro-Ukrainian elements from the peninsula while incentivizing Russians to move into the area as a pacification strategy. One which shows many of the hallmarks of genocide, and of which the Russians have a long history as part of ethnic cleansing campaigns in Crimea, especially targeting the Crimean Tatars.  You are effectively de-Ukrainizing Ukrainian territory on behalf of the Russians, which is a rhetorical technique the Russians use to try to eliminate \"Ukraine\" as a concept, to justify their effort to destroy Ukraine. If it isn't a real country, then there is no crime in Russia reabsorbing it, right? Well, turns out Ukraine is a country and trying to erase the concept does nothing to dissuade the millions of Ukrainians who have voted to pursue a course away from Russia and taken up arms to protect the government they put into place with those votes. In other words, you are participating quite directly in propagating Russian propaganda with the decision to use Russian names for Ukrainian territory.\n\nOP has three posts including this one, and another of which seems to be a rather lovingly depicted map of part of the Russian empire. This is pro-Russian propaganda, Reddit. Consume with care.",

In fact, these are the names of the military-civilian administrations that exist in these occupied territories.\n\nAnd the real Ukrainian names are indicated at the same time!\n\nC. Oh no, I made a map of the region of the Russian Empire, this clearly shows that I zealously support the seizure of neighboring states. And a conditional person who will create a historical map of the administrative division of the Third Reich in 1941, then he unequivocally supports the seizure of Poland\n\nYes, I am promoting the Kremlin agenda with this map. So much so that this map violates at least 4 articles of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, and if it ever gets into the field of view of the police, then oh, how it will not be great for me.",

They concentrate troops a bit away from the border and those respond to threat in a larger area.\n\nEven now Belgrod border isn't fully manned. Russia has just deployed more surveillance systems and scouts at key towers.",

You\u2019re betting Ukraine\u2019s counter offensive will go poorly, that support for Ukraine will dry up sooner rather than later, and that Russia can sustain their efforts till that point and beyond.  But even if all that happened, Russia is severely weakened and the idea they could \u201cconquer\u201d all of Ukraine is, imo, far less likely than a stalemate setting in at some point, leaving Russia with some Ukrainian ground.\n\nRegardless of the results, Russia\u2019s initial strategic goals are now unattainable so from that perspective they\u2019ve already lost.

In english, you say \"half past seven\" to say 7:30. Makes sense, half an hour after seven. \n\nBut in german for example, we say \"half eight\" (halb acht) to mean the same thing, 7:30. The logic here is that it's halfway between seven and eight. Or halfway on the way to the next full hour. \n\nSo the mathematical description of 5-0.5 is misleading here, because the spoke system uses a different logic than standard arithmetic, so you can't directly translate it",

But do look at the number 92, in danish and divide it into its parts. to-og-halv-fems, and you see that hidden behind what to a dane just seems like the way to say 92, because 90 is just halvfems and 2 is just to, is the vigesimal number system. Why is 90 \"halvfems\"? It literally just comes from a slighly old and weird way to say half 5. Why half 5? Because 5 is 100, or more accurately: 5 groups of 20 is 100. and 90 is 4 groups of twenties + half of a group of twenty. Thus to-og-halv-fems could be rendered as \"two and 4 twenties and a half twenty\".\n\nIt's... explained better in other comments in this thread.\n\nThe slightly more noteworthy point to a foreigner, is that as danes, a lot of us don't recognize this system, because we just learn the names of the 10's, and sure they sound slightly weird to you, but that's just their name. We don't think of 50 (halvtreds, half-threes) as 2 twenties and half a twenty, because we do use a base 10 system. We just think of halvtreds as the name for 50. \n\n10: ti\n\n20: tyve\n\n30: tredive\n\n40: fyrre\n\n50: halvtreds\n\n60: treds\n\n70:halvfjers\n\n80 - firs \n\n90 - halvfems\n\n100 - hundrede\n\nThe weird twenties thing doesn't even start until the 50s, and there it only exist in the form of a slightly confusing sounding name to foreigners. For all intents and purposes, despite the origin of these slightly weird names, we just say 92 as 2 and ninety, because halvfems means ninety.",

Lincoln's famous Gettysburg address saying *Four score and seven years ago*, which is basically \"4x20+7 years ago\". Same idea.\n\nBut in reality that's just the origins of our counting system. In actual day to day use the system is pretty regular and people just remember the names for 20, 30, 40 etc. E.g. 90 is 'halvfems', 92 'to og halvfems' (2 and 90), 93 is 'tre og halvfems' (3 and 90) and so on. Aka it isn't any harder than most other numbering systems in modern use.",

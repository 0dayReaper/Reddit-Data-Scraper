This is because corruption is often built into the system in Europe, normalised and legalised and not perceived as corruption even though it is, by any objective measure, very much so.\n\nCorruption often becomes legal through the efforts of lobbyists and the political classes to pass legislation or practice regulation that favours their employers or supporters and donors unfairly. \n\nIn the UK, for example. The fact that private education is highly subsidised by the state through tax exemption, that industrial agriculture has a free-reign to pollute the environment for profit and that the Tory-cronies were given hugely profitable contracts to supply PPE to the state during the COVID19 pandemic are all blatantly and obviously corrupt. At the same time they are also legal.\n\nThus, the UK, which is a country run by and for the upper-class elites and is extremely corrupt to any objective observer, is not perceived as corrupt.",

When Republicans/conservatives say they are for small government, they're talking small like a dictatorship.  Small as in, regulating the smallest aspects of our lives, like trying to regulate people's bodies, religion, sexual preferences, and gender identities.\n\nYes, you will find examples of corruption on both sides of the aisle, but one side is only interested in maintaining/increasing their power and catering to special interests, and the other actually tries to improve things for citizens from time to time.\n\nI get your outsider observation about tribalism, but from my viewpoint only conservatives have that mindset.  One of the things they love to bring up regarding the last election, is how many T\\*\\*\\*p supporters showed up at his rallies, how many of them has his stupid flags on their lawn, and cars &amp; trucks plastered with conservative bumper stickers.  Democratic voters don't tend to do this, because most of us don't \"identify\" with a political party, we just vote for the less-bad candidate.\n\nHonestly, I wish there were more parties to choose from (or no parties), and we had something like ranked choice voting.

Neoconservatism is fine with big government depending on what it is spending the money on.\n\nDemocrats are just as tribal. When I travelled to the states I even had a woman introduce herself as a democrat... I have many friends who are democrats and if you say something is wrong with a democratic candidate theyll give you every excuse under the sun (same as Republicans). Example with Obama where he went into more wars, kept all Bush jnrs military leaders and killed more civilians. But dems will defend this president who was voted in to end the war and did the exact opposite. Just admit yeah he got that wrong but nope they cant do it.",

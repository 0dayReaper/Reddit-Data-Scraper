[**This is the result**](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/2023_T%C3%BCrkiye_Milletvekili_Se%C3%A7imleri.png) by districts (lower map, upper is for provinces) in the last 2023 general elections and doesn't seem remotely similar.\n\nSecondly \"far right\" in Turkey is focused in ultranationalism, militarism and authoritarianism, not islamism. Turkish \"islamism\" is pretty moderate in the region context, not much more conservative or authoritarian than most conservative catholics in some regions of Europe and LESS conservative than american evangelicals or Israel ultra-orthodox for example, however their nationalism and authoritarianism is infinitelly more extreme, bordering classic fascist examples.\n\nSome example of this nationalist prevalence among turkish far right is the fact Kilicdaroglu, the secularist and moderate candidate in last elections, trying to appeal far right vote introduced nationalist extremist positions in his discourse, including \"expelling millions syrians\" if he had won. The fact he appealed not just to some mild \"civic\" patriotism but some hardcore intolerant ethnic nationalism, while mostly ignore any religious vote is not a coincidence, far right in Turkey is far more nationalist than \"islamist\".",

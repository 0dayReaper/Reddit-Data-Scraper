Imho, those chinese communities are also the reason, why Italy was the first western nation to be affected by Covid that strongly, but this won't be stated officially by anybody, as it could spark hate crimes and they have no 100% evidence, it's simple 1+1. \n\nThe chinese came to Italy, some waves of workers, because of the fashion industry and also the \"hidden economy\", like the (secret) factories which produce fake designer glasses and especially watches but, again, that's just my personal experience. These fake-industries are much more hidden, than in Turkey or Asia! (but you can buy fake watches in many stores, under the counter). \n\nYou can also find quotes on chinese workers working low-wage for the fashion industry in Naples and surroundings, in **Roberto Saviano's book \"Ghomorra\"**. Which everybody should have read, at least, once! One of the best recent books from Italy!!!\n\nOn the other hand, beside working in the factories (often led by chienese entrepreneurs), there are huge numbers of chinese workers in the gastronomy, in services (washing saloons, yey\\^\\^, and make-up/nail-studios, of course!)\n\nAnd they do lots of manufacturing and trade, for example, in Catania, in the very south of Italy, there are many chinese shops and stands and *there have been fights with the mafia in the past*, because they didn't want to pay the *pizzo*. So the Mafia in Catania started bullying the chinese businessman with what the mafia does: put chewing gum in the locks of the chinese stores... You don't believe that?! It's what they did! \ud83d\ude01 and much more serious stuff. Though, I don't know, how that \"battle\" went, so if the Chinese also pay the Pizzo or not. I doubt that they do!",

I remember newspaper articles from 2005-2010, even the as....e Salvini was very mouthy about it. Then, they switched back to black-immigrants and, now, the (far-) right also targets inhouse-minorities, as the transgender.\n\nOnce you understand that \"selections for hate\", the \"hate-fashion weeks\", how it works and why they do it, you never again vote for the modern right, as they are just opportunists, like \"sailors of the winds of hate\". \ud83e\udd2e",

The main purpose is to understand in depth what it means for the community under study to live in the city mentioned and the socio-economic impact of the same. We begin by analyzing the situation of the Andean state in the 90s, the causes that led politicians to the choice of changing the national currency, subjecting the citizenship to the process of dollarization. Then, we get to know the numbers of the Ecuadorian community, first of all in Italy and secondly in Genoa, verifying the existence of similarities between the city of Lanterna and Guayaquil, without neglecting the importance of both formal and informal relations between the two states.\n\nAlso here: https://eulacfoundation.org/en/women-ecuadorian-diaspora-genoa-migration-identity-and-memory",

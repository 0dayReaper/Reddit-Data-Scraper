It was also through Mexico that trade with East Asia went for the Spanish Empire, so it attracted more Spaniards than did Peru which was primarily a resource-extracting area further from the main trade artery of the empire.",

They were definitely not ignored. But what you're describing is an isolation of the native population like what happened in that anglo America or Portuguese America, which wasn't the case here. What happened here was very complex that didn't had only one cause but mostly goes around the culture. \n\nWhen the Spaniards came here what they found wasn't villages, they found developed kingdoms with strong established cultures and national identities, I mean they were Mayans after all. So the Spaniards made deals with some of those kingdoms and conquered others. They tried to convert them to the Spanish culture by \"ladinizaci\u00f3n\" but this didn't work since the Mayan culture was strongly established in the natives unlike other smaller cultures, so what the Spanish did was to mix both cultures.\n\nNow I want to clarify that most of the natives didn't hide in the jungle or anything like that, most of them lived in the Spanish cities or in villages near the cities. For instance Quetzaltenango which used to be one of the biggest colonial cities was mostly populated by natives in the colonial times, some sources suggest it could be around 80% of the population.\n\nEdit: there is also other reasons but I think that's one of the main reasons.",

Both in the US and in the Spanish Americas the government generally had regular interactions with the native populations and meddled in their affairs. Yet there's a reason why both in the US and in the Spanish Americas there is a clear correlation between how inhospitable to colonizers the area is and how preserved the native cultures are. The Puebla and the Hopi benefited as much from living in a desert as did the Maya from living in a jungle and the Aymara from living in the mountains.\n\n&gt; but this didn't work since the Mayan culture was strongly established in the natives unlike other smaller cultures\n\nAre you implying that the Nahua were a smaller culture? Because they were both more numerous and spread over a larger area. Yet there was a steeper decline in Nahua percentagwise (though it still remains the most spoken native language in Mexico) because the Nahua nobility were very strongly integrated into the Spanish system.\n\nThat isn't to say that the Spanish didn't try to do the same everywhere, but there are clear geographic reasons why it failed in some areas.\n\n&gt; Now I want to clarify that most of the natives didn't hide in the jungle or anything like that\n\nThey didn't hide, but like if you've ever been to central America it's not like you have to hide, the original Mayan cities were surrounded by jungle and even today villages exist separated by jungle except for often dingy roads. I'm not implying the people lived in trees, just that it's a lot easier to control towns in the Valley of Mexico where you can get from one town to the other within an hour's ride, than it is in Guatemala where the same distance takes you twice or thrice as long.\n\n&gt; Quetzaltenango which used to be one of the biggest colonial cities\n\nBut colonial cities were fairly small (Mexico City not withstanding) compared to the rural areas. Guatemala barely has a bit over 50% of the population living in urban areas in the modern day, and it was far fewer during the colonial period when the focus was on resource extraction. Also that city in specific also shows that the local elites were not integrated, since it was even named using a Nahua name since the Spaniards used their Nahua allies to conquer and control it (a pattern also seen in other places), so the local elites were suppressed there, not integrated.",

If you're talking about Nahuas like the Mexicas, then no. As I just said all this is a very complex there was not only one reason. In the case of the Nahuas most Nahuas were people oppressed by the Mexicas, the hispanization was better received. The Mexica culture was considered as brutal by the Spaniards (more than any other culture), so the eradication of their culture was a priority. Despite all that the Nahua culture is still preserved, mostly because it was a strong established culture. \n\n&gt;They didn't hide, but like if you've ever been to central America it's not like you have to hide, the original Mayan cities were surrounded by jungle and even today villages exist separated by jungle except for often dingy roads.

But this is irrelevant, because even though Qeqchis is one of the biggest Mayan cultures now days, the some of the biggest ones are the Kakchiquel, Kiches, Mam.

The Aztecs called themselves Mexica, and the modern name of the country and identity are largely based in the pre-Columbian Mexican one. So while a Cherokee claiming to be American would be denying the native heritage of his people and identifying with the colonizer, someone who considers themselves Mexican wouldn't have the same issue since Mexico has spent the last 200 years building a national identity primarily based on the Aztec empire as it's historical predecessor and painting Spain as the bad guy. That said, Mexicans can be extremely racist towards indigenous people, as the old Spanish caste system was never fully removed from the heads of many people, even if it is less prominent now.",

When native tribes went to war, one of the things they would do to \"legitimately\" take over land was to burn the mummies that owned it.  Eventually Pizarro figured this out and ordered all the mummies to be burnt and the land taken.  Another thing Pizarro did is to capture the Inca (the emperor) Atahuallpa who was considered a god by the Incas.  The Incas had a huge army, but the army didn't attack the Spanish because they were afraid the Inca would be harmed or killed.",

You don\u2019t see many Americans sipping tea regardless of their English ancestry. It\u2019s a culture/ethnicity/identity, it\u2019s not decided by your blood. Also keep in mind that self identification is really the only thing that works for such surveys, so unless as you want to pull out a skin color chart or blood tests then letting people decide what they\u2019ll label themselves as is what we got.\n\nAlso Chile is a way smaller country than Mexico. 13% is a pretty big share for indigenous people. The Mexico wiki page has a very interesting discussion on how dumb and complicated trying to choose what race people in Mexico are is. I think it applies to most Latin American countries too. Also don\u2019t forget about the waves of cultural assimilation and more recent nationalism telling everyone that being different is bad, we should ALL be the just Mexican.",

Just because those groups are numerous doesn\u2019t mean a high population, it means variety. It\u2019s also been more than 500 years since the colonial genocide, with lots of cultural assimilation, nationalism, prejudice and shame in between. Also Argentina and Mexico are light blue, so could be that Argentina is close to 1% and Mexico is five times that.  Still definelty wrong our outdated as newer more inclusive classifications give things like 10-20 %. Maybe this map\u2019s data only included monolingual indigenous people (Wikipedia says that Argentina is 2.4% but media there is also kinda ignorant and unappreciative of anything that\u2019s not Italian, once a TV show host said that there was not a single black Argentinian or slaves in the past so Argentinian couldn\u2019t be racist)\n\n\nSame as how Brazil has more Lebanese people than Lebanon, doesn\u2019t make sense but that doesn\u2019t make it untrue.",

But after 5 centuries more people will be just \"mestizos\" instead of identifying as natives.\n\nWhile Chile is a bit more different, native population was smaller, and in the more than 200 years of colonization, Chile as a colony, was never able to defeat the mapuche people. Occupation of the Araucania just started in 1861 and finally anexed all the territories in 1883, then the native population was integrated in the country.\n\nThat means there is a lot more people that will identify as native as the annexation of the native territories occurred just a bit more than a hundred years ago, instead of 500 years.\n\nIs not exactly the same but think of it as Japan and Okinawa, while for all of us Okinawa is fully japanese, Okinawa was a different nation, the Ryukyu Kingdom, with different culture, arquitecture and all that, and were incorporated at the end of the 1800's by the japanese empire.\n\nSo a lot of people identify as both japanese and okinawan, some even like to call themselves only okinawan and others even speak the okinawan language. Is not coincidence that's where most US military bases are, because Japan prefer that instead of having US bases in the main islands, and some okinawans protest against the militarization of the islands by both the US and Japan, as they don't want what happened in WWII, to happen again, which is going to war for Japan.",

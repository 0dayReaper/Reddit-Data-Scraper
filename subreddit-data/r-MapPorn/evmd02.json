Biology is the History of Life, Philosophy is the history of our morale and ethics. All information we deduce has been  built upon knowledge discovered in the past. \n\nSo whether youre passionate about make up, fashion, art, math, physics, computer science, automobiles...you will inadvertently become a historian of that subject. If your passion is cars, I bet you can tell me who invented which part, which model or year it came from, why the body was made that way. Or Fashion, you can tell me about the designer, the type of material used, where it comes from and how it was locally used, and the past lines. Even the culinary arts, how spices originated for the dish, the history of how it's traditionally cooked, and how its used today. Then you can break it down into social history, fiscal history, geopolitical history.\n\nThen you can Look at the 1848 liberal revolutions that overtook Europe. How in America this was viewed as the American revolution 2.0 happening in Europe. Though they failed, it did spur the movement of realism forward eventually segueing into photography as a pure realist form of art, eclipsing the movement leading to impressionism. With the age of realism rising over the failed idealistic age of Von metternich, and the philosophies oriented around it, would help Hindenburg coin the term realpolitik. I think we all know what would happen once a Pragmatic germany unified under a prussian militaristic orthodox culture. Then we can tie the 1848 revolutions into Mark Twain's book the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, how he captured the Annebelum South in the 1850's by integrating Mr. Twain's vernacular, a first showing the realistic language used.  The same book where Huck is begins to question Tom's romanticized view of the world, society's role based on skin, religion, and eventually meshes the two trains of thought by idealizing his decision to go west and start new. Where the old and idealist inaction would have no sway on his individualism. \n\nIn the end, when you can look at people and admire them for their passion for something other than your own, and you really begin to appreciate how complex and grand Humanity's story truly is.",

When you walked into his classroom  the walls were covered  with 8\"x10\" pictures of men in uniform.  If you paid attention to the  pictures you would recognize Mr.McNair from the hardware store, Mr.Phillips from the gas company, the quiet Mr. Allen at the wool and mohair warehouse. World War 2 and Korean war veterans, also pictures of former students in uniform who were returning from Vietnam.  It made his class real. \n  Mr. Crow's lessons stick with me to this day.",

One teacher I had in high school had iPads and we never once used them for anything useful. Another had a smart board and used it like a projector on a white board (which was behind the smart board and could have been used instead). Now that I'm in a education program I see how I could use these much more effectively but I wouldn't say I need them to be a successful teacher. \n\nThe money would be better spent on technology for students. It needs to be buying technology that can help students by exposing them to useful tools. GIS/Cad/Programing/Adobe classes as examples but also basic computer literacy and office suite competency for younger kids.",

Due next week.  Then we'll start with the history of indian tea trade with a supplemental reading on a quick overview of the English, and also this book on how we can't believe any economic data on Tajikistan.  Due the week after.\"\n\nLiterally 90% of the class quit in the first week.  It was glorious.",

When Denmark and the HRE were first created as states, Slesvig was Danish and Holstein was German.\n\nDuring the middle ages, a Danish king acquired Holstein and promised that thr two would never be seperated (since they had really close interaction). As the middle ages progressed  the Danish kings acquired more german lands and titles from Holstein, with a feudal obligation similar to that of Prussia (Danish kings were subjects of the emperor in their roles as dukes of Holstein and Lauenburg, but independent in their role as monarchs of Denmark).\n\nA relatively simple feudal setup, that only really becomes complicated once feudalism disappears and it has to be transformed into a nation-state setup.",

Since the English Plantagenets owned the duchies of Normandy and Gascony which (being French fiefs) owed allegiance to the King of France, but were still independent as Kings themselves. Then the Plantagenets claimed they were the real kings of France according to the English system of inheritance, and the Valois were the real usurpers, but then the Plantagenets got usurped by the Lancasters who claimed the English throne using the French system of inheritance, but still claimed the French throne based on the English system of inheritance. And during this whole time the French kings were either dying in battles or slipping in and out of madness.\n\nAll very confusing and took at least 100 years of war to clear the whole mess up.",

Since the middle of 2000, there have been fewer drinkers every year. For example, when I was a student, it was considered normal to go for a beer 1-2 times a week after studying at the university. Now I hardly see young people drinking. Somewhere in the middle of 2000, the country began promoting a healthy lifestyle following the example of Soviet propaganda. Broadcasts of mass sports competitions are advertised on TV. Marathons, bicycle races, swimming competitions, etc. are organized in cities for ordinary people (not athletes). Schools have increased the number of hours for physical education lessons. Everywhere there is a ban on advertising alcohol and tobacco. There is a law banning the sale of alcohol from 23:00 to 8:00. But since the beginning of the pandemic, I often see news that alcohol sales have increased. Personally, according to my observations, they drink much more in Britain. I would associate the number of deaths from alcohol in Russia with the use of low-quality alcohol by some segments of the population. This is usually found in villages or in poor areas of cities. That is, these people cannot afford high-quality alcohol and buy what they can.",

But rejecting all news programs because they may be bad is senseless as well.  \n\nEither way this was not from a scientific program nor was it BBC. It was a few writters discussing Russian culture after studying it or living there for years.  \n\nEdit:  \n\n&gt;I once watched a scientific program on the BBC about hamsters (it was somewhere in the early 2000s). They showed some kind of Hamsters from Russia. The male helped the female during childbirth.

We talk about hamsters - we show what Russians are bad.  \n\nWithout having watched the program I suspect you misunderstood its point or it was presented in a way to do so. I was born in a country where fathers weren't allowed into the maternity ward and it was uncommon in the West as well decades ago. What the program was probably doing is showing that mammals including humans need that physical connection. It was simply pointing out that in Russia the cultural attitudes should change. Just like saying too much drinking or smoking is a bad social practice.  \n\nI have watched the BBC for several decades and have never see them make anything as stupid as you suggested.",

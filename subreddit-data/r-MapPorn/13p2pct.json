                    "comment": "Kurdish were living in the area and were a mix or semi nomadic groups and villages. The proposed land is likely not majority Assyrian, maybe not even plurality Assyrian. Also Arabs and Turks were also living in the area, as well as Yazidi, and other minority groups that still live in the region.\n\nBut part of the mechanics of the Assyrian and contemporary Armenian genocide that happened at the same time was that the Ottoman state used Kurdish Irregular units as a tool to both trigger the genocide and carry it out. Communal disputes between Kurdish populations and Armenian and Assyrian populations were part of the trigger for the Ottoman claims of disloyal populations that were supporting the Russian Invasion in the region during WWI which was going o. At the same time. The Ottoman army forcibly relocated hundreds of thousands of assyrians and Armenians for \"their protection against Kurdish reprisal attacks and the approaching Russian  armies and militias\". These forced marches at their best were like the Trail of Tears in America. Thousands died from the lack of food, the forced marches thru snowy mountains and desert, and by attacks by Kurdish Irregular units in coordination with the Ottoman Army units who were nominally there to protect the Armenians and Assyrians. The Ottoman state then rewarded the Kurds who participated in the Kurdish Irregular units (in both the genocide actions and the actual war) by giving them the land of now depopulated Armenian and Assyrian villages. \n\nIt's important to look at the state of the Ottoman Empire right before the genocide. They were specifically fearful of losing more land to localized Christian based nationalist movements like they had lost almost all their lands in the Balkans across the previous century. These massive series of previous wars and lost land to these nationalist movements resulted in millions of muslim refugees fleeing communal violence after the independce wars and fleeing the wars themselves. This combined with the muslim refugee from the Russian Imperial state who had conducted their own ethnic cleansing campaigns in the Black Sea and Caucasian regions (see the Crimean Tatars and the Circissain genocide in the late 19th century). This resulted in about fully 1/3 of the offical Ottoman population counts being refugees or one generation removed from being refugees (which is part of the reason modern Turkey has crazy genetic diversity). \n\nThe Ottoman state is obsessed with finding places to settle these refugees and stopping any more nationalist movements from getting off the ground. They determined that while having a bare majority Muslim control in a region wasn't enough to defend against that region being carved out of the country, that no hostile state would bother trying to add a 95% muslim region to a new Christian state. So they carried out a relocation and genocide campaign to redistribute and reduce minority religious populations to be less than 5% of each region in the Empire. Which is why, while Armenians and Assyrians lived everywhere in the empire, their small numbers in Western Turkey meant they weren't targeted as violently there while the horrific genocides were happening in the East to their fellow ethnic cousins, and why in the West, Greeks were more highly targeted and not Armenians and Assyrians.",

I relatively recently read books on the Crimean War and on the Ottomans in WW1, and another angle to this is that the Russians in particular were using perceived grievances of Christians in the Ottoman Empire as justifications for sticking its fingers into the Ottoman Empire and that by WW1, it might well half-reasonably be viewed by the Ottomans that Christians within their empire might be pro-Russian/provide support to Russian invaders. Doesn't quite justify what happened, but helps illustrate their state of mind.",

But most genocides have brutal logic to them. The Ottoman state had legimate concerns that they took the most brutal options available because they had a long standing social disconnect between the communities and new modern situations that demanded real action, especially with the failure of Ottomanism as government policy and the Tanzimat policy reformation goals being unmet. The Holodomor was a breaking of internal opposition and imposition of ideology policies without concern for real world effects. Chinese current genocide tactics is to remove internal opposition and cultural disconnect for economic exploitation. While the Nazis targeted Jews because Hitler thought they were a global conspiracy that was fundamental to uproot and destroy for the future of Europeans as a whole. It's so bizarre that most people can't be convinced of its internal logic even if others can be dismissed by might makes right in resource competition or ideological purity tests.",

They were obsessed with reducing minority representation to negate future new independent states as they had just lost massive amounts of land to the new countries of the Balkans who won independence as minority nationalist movements.\n\nThe Greek Genocide / Pontic Genocide: pontic Greeks were dumped into the Black sea by the tens of thousands, the western Greeks were largely targeted by less organized violence because the front was too close and the army couldn't spare the troops to commit more acts of genocide\n\nThe Amrenian Genocide: the most famous one because American reporters and American red cross workers were in the region and documented the genocide thru letters and reports back home. \n\nThe Assyrian Genocide: also documented by foriegn journalists and Ottoman records. But they were signficantly fewer in number and less foriegn people understood the difference between the Armenian and Assyrian peoples.",

It's fine that you want to include their alphabets, but it completely defies the purpose of this map. You are trying to show how the name Russia is SAID in different languages, and then you exclude the vast majority of this sub from understanding how they are said in these slavic/greek languages, because it's impossible to tell how the letters are pronounced if you don't know these alphabets. How am I supposed to tell from this map that Russia in Russian is \"Rossiya\" if I don't already know it? Just transcribe it into the latin alphabet for goodness sake.",

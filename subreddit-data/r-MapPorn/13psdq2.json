            "comment": "Edit - This map is using data that is over 10 years old. \n\nSo this was a map published in 2016 [link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/07/26/this-map-shows-how-many-people-are-getting-high-near-you/) and is further using NSDUH data (National Survey of Drug Use and Health). NSDUH data is very well done, but has a time lag of typically 2 years from collection to availability/reports, so 2016 means 2014 data collection if the publication was timely. However, to get substate estimates (which are shown in the map) they usually have to combine 3 years of data collection, so this is likely data from 2012-2014 to get these estimates. Which explains why the rates are so low, and a reminder this is asking about monthly use which is going to be lower than yearly use which is the more common public facing estimate.\n\nThis also means that this is well before many states opened recreational markets or even had opened as many medical markets.",

Government will also regulate strengths and strains. \n\nYou\u2019re right, none of those are specific to weed, which is why it\u2019s a good idea to keep dangerous drugs illegal. Why not be like Japan or South Korea, free and nice and prosperous countries, that have no problem banning and controlling weed and other drugs?\n\n(And no, saying that alcohol and tobacco are harmful and legal is not an argument. If this is so, why would you want to introduce *another* harmful drug into widespread use?)",

Low taxes will encourage use (see alcohol and tobacco) and lead to calls for it rising. You\u2019ll also notice that countries in Europe with very low taxes on alcohol and cigarettes also have a massive illegal trade of them. \n\nJapan and South Korea are not authoritarian dictatorships. Lol. You just pretend to think that because they ban drugs effectively and it defies your worldview.\n\nAnd thank you, at least you didn\u2019t make that last, foolish argument that so many people do",

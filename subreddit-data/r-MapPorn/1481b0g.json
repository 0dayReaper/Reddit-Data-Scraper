                            "comment": "Human Rights Watch seems to use the same distinction, based on UN definitions, regarding Saudi Arabia's \"slavery-like\" forced labor. The practical difference seems pretty negligible. Like with slavery you aren't legally free to leave because you're property, and you can legally be kept locked up and beaten if you try to escape. With forced labor you're legally free to leave at any time, but you can illegally be kept locked up and beaten if you try to escape.\n\n[HRW excerpt:](https://www.hrw.org/reports/2008/saudiarabia0708/5.htm) \n\n\"In the majority of Saudi Arabia forced labor cases we reviewed, employers confined domestic workers to the workplace, including by locking them in from the outside, and withheld their passports, placing them at risk of arrest and punishment if they escaped. As in the case of Nour Miyati, several employers committed or threatened physical violence, and punishments often increased in severity if the domestic worker attempted to escape.  \nExamples provided by the ILO of the involuntary nature of work include: physical confinement in the work location, psychological compulsion (order to work backed up by a credible threat of a penalty), induced indebtedness (by falsification of accounts, excessive interest charges, etc.), deception about types and terms of work, withholding and non-payment of wages, and retention of identity documents or other valuable personal possessions.\"",

If a person wants to consider some countries \"bad\" and divides the world into \"them and us\", then he will find a way to show this in statistics. For example, I have seen many maps depicting Europe. If Russia wins in statistics, it will not be marked on the map as a European country, so it will not participate in statistics (for example, maps with the cost of gasoline). If Russia loses in the statistics, it will be marked as a European country. You can also display a map with GDP or average salary where Eastern European countries and Russia will have a low rating. But this statistic is lying, because it does not take into account the price level in a particular country. That is, you can get a big salary but spend all of it on food, medicine, education, utilities, gasoline, etc. And you can get less but also spend less on everything. I don't remember who said it, but there are three kinds of lies: lies, blatant lies and statistics.",

                    "comment": "Kind of. It's more the reverse of that. Slavery in America was ended by the 13th amendment to the constitution in 1865. The relevant text of the amendment says:\n\n\"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\"\n\nSo basically it is carving out an exception saying that convicted criminals who are forced to work cannot appeal to the 13th amendment as a redress. This is definitely something that is controversial, and that some states have disallowed individually. But classic definitions of slavery do not include convicted criminals, whether or not they are mandated to work.\n\nI believe that, at this point, all American prisoners who do mandated labor are paid (though I may be wrong here), but the pay is generally very low; they are exempt from minimum wage laws, as well as other worker protection laws.\n\nJust to be clear on my view here, I think mandated prison labor should generally not exist (though I think job training and vocational programs should be widely available). When prisoners do voluntarily work, they should be covered by many more regulatory protections than they currently have. Having said that, while there are a lot of troublesome things in US prisons, I do not think it is useful to lump in prisoners with classic slavery definitions, as there are many gradations across countries, and muddies the waters of the slavery issue. I think it is its own issue, that is related to the slavery issue, and very important.\n\nJust my opinion, and reasonable people can certainly disagree with me on it.",

I know a couple guys like that and frankly think that they are simply being pedantic in that they are insisting on applying a definition of slavery that is not consistent with what most Americans commonly consider \"slavery.\"  While there is much to dislike in the prison labor systems in the US, and there are some similarities to historical slavery, they are not SLAVERY.",

A staggeringly high number, but only enough to get the US into the orange. If we exclude those in jail, rather than prison, it drops to \\~1.2 million, into the lighter oranges. \n\nSecond, a huge number of US prisoners aren't in slave-like conditions. According to this guardian article [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/27/slavery-loophole-unpaid-labor-in-prisons](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/27/slavery-loophole-unpaid-labor-in-prisons) there are 800,000 prisoners in the US who are forced to work, and in five states they are forced to work without pay. It also brings the US number to 0.24% using the 800k number and significantly less if we are looking for specifically no money. Still horrible, but doesn't place the US in red. \n\nThird, orgs like this tend to not include prison as slavery because it obfuscates the issue that they're trying to address. That's how the US gets a &lt;0.1%.",

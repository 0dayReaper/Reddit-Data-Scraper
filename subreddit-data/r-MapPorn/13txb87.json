The Treaty of Sugauli was signed in 1816, ceding large parts of the Nepalese controlled territories to the British.

They had no say in foreign policy however. And it wasn't practical for Britain to attempt a full colonial endeavour in that massive landmass. In fact, in 1857, it was the armies of these allies that fought some of the states that decided to go against Britain (effectively ensuring the continuity of the Raj as it was beneficial for them). I'm from one of those kingdoms btw. We joined the Indian Union only 2 years after British India gained independence. I recommend reading 'False Allies' by Manu S Pillai to understand the intricacies of this.",

Only occupations after 1481 are counted as that is very roughly around the formation of the idea of \"the west\" (arguable statement, yes). Otherwise you can exclude Anatolia from the map due to Rome.\r  \n\r  \nThis includes modern occupations such as the Afghan War or the Korean War\r  \n\r  \n3. \"occupation\" includes any instance where soldiers from the aforementioned countries directly and uncontestedly control a territory, even if legally they haven't annexed it, or the territory is under their de-facto control for a substantial time even if it was never militarily occupied (I am sure there are some parts in colonized Siberia or Central Africa where no soldier has ever stepped foot in but those areas are still considered occupied). The exceptions are marked in dark red and will be explained. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n4. Arabia is based on this map:  https://irissansfrontieres.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/gertrude-bell-map-saudi-arabia-early-1900s.gif\r  \n\r  \nThe Hashemite Kingdom was a British Protectorate but it existed for a short time and there was no serious British military presence in the area.\r  \n\r  \n5. Tibet is based on this map of British expeditions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Map\\_of\\_Lhasa,\\_Tibet\\_(Thibet)\\_and\\_the\\_Himalayas\\_in\\_1885\\_from\\_12\\_of\\_%27The\\_Imperial\\_Gazetteer\\_of\\_India\\_...\\_Second\\_edition\\_(revised\\_and\\_enlarged)%27\\_(11180098823)\\_(cropped).jpg\r  \n\r  \n6. Xinjiang is based on Soviet occupation where the Wikipedia page states that Soviet troops did not advance beyond Turfan and Kashgar\r  \n\r  \n7. The coastal cities by the East China Sea and the territories near Beijing were directly occupied in the Opium Wars and the Boxer Rebellion, I used this maps for reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mutual\\_Protection\\_of\\_Southeast\\_China.png\r  \n\r  \nBut many cities and regions in the South of China were also claimed as treaty ports and cities. I marked these regions as indirectly occupied but how much military presence there was in each city really varied so take the  territories as very rough estimates. \r  \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty\\_ports#/media/File:Chinese\\_Treaty\\_Ports.svg\r  \n\r  \n8. I used these two maps https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian\\_occupation\\_of\\_Adalia#/media/File:Treaty\\_sevres\\_otoman\\_it.svg\r  \n\r  \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Turkish\\_War\\_%281919%E2%80%931922%29#/media/File:Greco\\_Turkish\\_War\\_1919-1922.svg\r  \n\r  \nfor how far into Anatolia the occupying forces advanced. You could also argue that the entirety of Anatolia had been occupied due to the Ottoman capitulation but there was never an allied military presence in the marked territories and most of it had been legally left to the Ottoman rump state anyway.\r  \n\r  \n9. I could not find good info as to how far the British advanced into Malaya or Northern Siam in WW2 so I marked the whole of Thailand as unoccupied but I might be wrong.\r  \n\r  \n10. There have been small island discovered in the last century or very small islands which were never occupied. I haven\u2019t included these.",

There was certainly a lot of European influence in the Ottoman Empire, but ultimately it was founded and ran by Asian people, who spoke an Asian language and practiced a religion that was mostly practiced in Asia(and North Africa, obviously, but not relevant).",

Proxy wars between the US and USSR include stuff like the Chinese Civil War and Bangladesh Liberation War, but also stuff where one side participated directly like the Soviet-Afghan War and Korea.\n\nActually, in Korea, Soviet pilots were involved and frequently dueled Americans, but they kept it a secret so it would still be a proxy war and not an open one.",

The Ottoman Empire was something else completely, a Middle Eastern Empire which was strong enough to conquer parts of Southeastern Europe. More similar to empires like the Arab, Persian, and Mughal Empires, frankly.",

It was granted to aristocrats, both local and Turkish, for economic exploitation in exchange for military service. This grant was not supposed to be hereditary, but in practice it often was. The local lords were supposed to be loyal to the sovereign, but they sometimes weren't. The peasants were forced to work the lord's land and had minimal rights when compared to the lord.\n\nFrom the 17th century, with changes in technology and agricultural practices, it became more practical for land to concentrated and exploited by largely privately owned enterprises which kept the land grant when the boss died. This became the prevailing form of land \"ownership\" by the early 19th century, when the system was abolished and the enterprises and their owners became outright owners of the land.\n\nDoes that really sound like a completely different phenomenon to you?",

In 1890 there was the Heligoland-Zanzibar treaty, in which Germany, with possessions nearby, agreed not to interfere with British affairs in Zanzibar.\n\nBut when I was in Zanzibar, that whole history was seen somewhat differently, and Zanzibar does not consider itself to have ever actually been occupied by Western powers.\n\nThe   \nPortugese were paid tribute, and the Portugese saw Zanzibar therefore as part of the Portugese Empire, but Zanzibar today doesn't deem having been a tributary state to actually having been occupied and ruled, but to have maintained autonomy and self-government.\n\nThe rule by the Omani Sultanate was direct, for a while, but that wasn't Western.\n\nBritain saw Zanzibar as a self-government Protectorate.  One could argue that the shortest war in the world, the 1896 Anglo-Zanzibar War, constituted a British occupation, when Britain ended the rule of a Sultan unfavourable to their interests, a definite act of imperialism.  There is no doubt that Britain installed one candidate over another, in a war that was undertaken by ships.\n\nIn Zanzibar, as I was told, this was seen as a British intervention and perhaps an imposition, but never British occupation or rule.  The British would appoint residents or representatives, sometimes imposing requirements on the Zanzibari sultans, but never an occupation, a  governor or direct rule.\n\nOne could argue the case, but it's interesting that there may be different perspectives on this from the Western to the local.  After all, Spain had a policy where anything they simply sailed past first was theirs (leading to some disputes with Britain, which took a position that you had to land on the territory to claim it, and both of them not caring a damn what the local indigenous nations thought about it).",

And of course the treaties gave away land that was not actually always ruled by those powers, or with the understanding of the local people.\n\nWhere I live, we had the Nootka Sound Controversy, in which Spain and England came close to war.  And it's a little more specific than what I wrote.\n\nThe Spanish claim was based on having been the first European power in the area of Nootka Sound.  The Spanish claim actually was based on the Treaty of Tordesillas, but also on having navigated the area (so yes, saying they simply sailed by was a simplification).\n\nThe British took an entirely different position.  They couldn't care less about the Treaty of Tordesillas.  And they took a position that any country can navigate any area, but a claim was not legitimate unless the land was effectively occupied.  As Spain had representation and ships at Nootka Sound, but not occupation, their claim was disputed by Britain (in truth, Britain didn't have effective occupancy either, but this idea gave them a basis to reject the Spanish claim).\n\nThe Spanish ships in the area seized British ships.  War was not only a real possibility, but the countries prepared for war.  The Spanish hoped to involve the Bourbons in France, but they were busy still trying to fight off the French Revolution, and so the move to war was not pursued.\n\nThe outcome, for the Europeans, was that the area, along with other Pacific areas not actually occupied by Spain, was that both parties could trade, erect temporary but not certain permanent buildings like garrisons, and Nootka Sound would be a free port for all nations.\n\nThat's the European view.  For the Chief Maquinna and his people, who may not have known about the treaty negotiations, their view was still one of this was their territory, and they carried on as before.  It's another example of how European countries would show that they ruled on maps, where they didn't actually rule on the ground.",

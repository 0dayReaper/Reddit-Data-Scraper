            "comment": "Lelystad, from water to land. In the early 1950s, the process of poldering Oostelijk Flevoland began, transforming it from a body of water into usable land. In the early 1960s, construction of houses, roads, and more commenced, and the town quickly grew. By 1978, it had become one of the prosperous cities in the country. However, in the mid-1980s, Almere gained favor due to its proximity to Amsterdam, and many people started leaving Lelystad. This led to a rise in poverty and crime levels.\n\nFortunately, in the 1990s, the situation began to improve. Additionally, the popular hospital-based television series was filmed in the local hospital, bringing some attention back to the city. Lelystad slowly started attracting more residents, and its population grew from 60,000 to 70,000. Eventually, in the late 2010s, it reached the milestone of 80,000 inhabitants.\n\nCurrently, the city is home to 40,000 houses, and in response to the housing crisis and increasing population influx, the city council has decided to build an additional 40,000 houses. The future of Lelystad remains uncertain - will it prosper or face challenges in achieving its ambitious growth? Only time will tell. From its humble beginnings as a small village with green lanes, trees, and a close-knit community where everyone knows everyone, Lelystad may evolve into a bustling urban city that thrives alongside its larger neighbor, Almere.",

            "comment": "For a better aerial view of Flevoland in 1961 and 1981, it's important to note that Noordoostpolder had already been poldered by that time. The process of poldering Noordoostpolder began in the early 1940s. At this point, Oostelijk Flevoland was nearing completion, while Zuidelijk Flevoland had not yet been poldered. Also you can see the construction of the Houtribdijk. This was meant for a future project called the Markerwaard. Which was however canceled. \n\n[Better aerial view of Flevoland](https://imgur.com/a/sRaW8gJ)",

            "comment": "There are some fun things to see. I just noticed that in 1971 there's a canal from the east to the south. Then in 1981 you see they removed a part of the canal and diverted it. You can clearly see how they changed and developed the city plans. If you also also look a bit better you can see some area's being changed, removed, taken down, or even filled in after 20 years. Wished for some aerial pictures of the 90's.",

A time ago I posted a Netherlands map here and got a bunch of feedback with great ideas on how to make it better (thank you for this deep dive into the local context). So I redrew my old map and (hope so) made it better :)\r  \n\r  \nI wanna say my huuuge thank you to the community, you gave me a lot of inspiration! I'll be happy to see your feedback here again!",

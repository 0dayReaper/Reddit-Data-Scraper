The generational gap from before and after that campaign is obvious when you look at how many people before smoked in high school vs after the campaign . I went to high school in the early 2010\u2019s and smoking was not prevalent at all.  \n\nEdit: It even shamed older people to stop. It probably helped when state by state, smoking sections in restaurants were phased out and they started not allowing smoking in certain public areas and by hospitals and other business entrances.",

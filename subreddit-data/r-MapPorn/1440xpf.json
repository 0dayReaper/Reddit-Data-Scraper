Florida also included the coasts of what are now Alabama, Mississippi, and that little bit of Louisiana. (And I'm not getting into territorial disputes with what is now Canada.)\n\nMost of these weren't states yet. Maine was still part of Massachusetts. West Virginia was still west Virginia. Vermont was contested between New York and New Hampshire. And any state west of the mountains was generally territory claimed by another state. For example Kentucky was claimed as part of Virginia. These weren't [ceded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_cessions) until later.\n\nAnd this clearly uses modern flags. The depicted Mississippi flag was only adopted two years ago.",

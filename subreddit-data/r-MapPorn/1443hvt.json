There are some states where it\u2019s legal for people under 21 to drink alcohol under some heavy restrictions: e.g., in some states (Alaska, Kansas, Louisiana, etc.), people under 21 can legally consume alcohol if it is provided by a legal guardian or spouse on private property. Consumption of small amounts of alcohol for religious purposes is either explicitly legal or always allowed in practice as well.\n\nBut in general drinking alcohol under the age of 21 is marginally legal in some situations to outright illegal in all of the US.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always this way: states used to vary a fair bit in their legal drinking age, kind of like Canada today. It is also constitutionally prohibited for the federal government to directly define a minimum drinking age, but they got around that in the 1980s by passing legislation that would reduce federal funding for highways in any state with a legal drinking age below 21 by 10%. So all states raised the drinking age to 21 after that to avoid losing a *lot* of infrastructure funding.\n\nTo answer your final question, the puritans were senator Frank Lautenberg, president Reagan (of course), and MADD.",

Youngsters buying folk\u00f6l happened, but it is rare, more common to buy the ciders.\n\nWhen you turn 20, you're allowed to buy alcohol from our state run liquor store Systembolaget, and it's an actual liquor store that ONLY sells liquor and nothing else. It's the only place in Sweden you're able to buy alcoholic beverages above 3.5%.",

E.g. \"Niemcy\" as in German men will have a different declination (Niemc\u00f3w, Niemcom, Niemcami, Niemcach) than \"Niemcy\" as in Germany, the country  (Niemczech, Niemcom, Niemcami, Niemczech).

And here you can see it in action - both country names and people plurals are formed from the same singular name for a man from a given country, but we're using this special virile plural for people and the non-virile plural for countries. For Germany they ended up the same in the nominative, but some of the other cases are still different (\"Niemiec\" vs \"Niemc\u00f3w\" in the genitive for example).\n\nWe also have names for women from these countries obviously (Czeszka, W\u0119gierka, Niemka, W\u0142oszka and Czeszki, W\u0119gierki, Niemki, W\u0142oszki in plural), basically you just add \"-ka\" to the masculine version to get a feminine one.",

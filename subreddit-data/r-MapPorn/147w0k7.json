And things get even trickier with the massive displacement internally and refugees abroad, numbering in the millions.\n\nWith that said, the Ukrainian military and civilian deaths since February 2022 seem to be in the low tens of thousands, so it would have *some* impact on life expectancy, but probably not as much as COVID-19 did, which killed over 110,000 people in Ukraine.",

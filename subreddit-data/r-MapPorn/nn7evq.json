I can't find an article on that specific case (searching Google actually gets your comment) but other articles state that Canada gives automatic citizenship to anyone born within their airspace, even if it's an overflight, there's an example below of a baby born on a flight from Amsterdam to Boston that was flying over Canada and didn't even stop there, although I do note that's not confirmed in the article. So even if it hadn't touched down, the child would be Canadian.\n\n&gt;Babies born in Canadian airspace are automatically extended Canadian citizenship, regardless of parentage.\n\n&gt;It happens more often than one might think. Last year, a Qatar Airways flight from Miami to Doha diverted to Gander Airport in Newfoundland when a passenger went into labour. The woman's baby was born in Canadian airspace, before the aircraft touched down, meaning the child could automatically be considered a Canadian citizen.\n\nhttps://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/air-born-will-baby-delivered-mid-flight-get-canadian-citizenship-1.2368565\n\nhttps://www.traveller.com.au/citizenship-available-for-baby-born-in-canadian-airspace-78rp\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_aboard_aircraft_and_ships#Canada",

For example, Kings George III, George IV, and William IV of the UK also held the title King of Hannover.  When William IV died, his heir was his niece, Victoria, who became Queen of the UK.  However, Hannover had a \u201cno smelly girls\u201d sign on their clubhouse, so her uncle became the king there instead.  So, if you were a subject of the King of Hannover during that time, sure, you also happened to be a subject of the *person* who held the title \u201cKing of the United Kingdom\u201d, but you weren\u2019t subject to that *title*, which made a difference, come 1837.",

He lived most his life in Canada but travelled back when he was in his 30's to see family and the country his parents were from. He had no agenda and was just travelling around on his own. One night he made it to a sleepy town, found a pub for some supper, and then planned to find a room. A couple heard him talking in his very bad Dutch and asked where he was from. He told them he was Canadian so they asked him where he was staying. He admitted he didn't have a place and asked if they knew of a room somewhere. They demanded he come stay with them. Then they invited all their friends over to meet the Canadian and tell stories. He said he stayed there a week longer than he expected cause everyone wanted to house him, and everyone wanted to tell him war stories. This would have been in the 60's I think.\n\nEither way, it was in his opinion that the Dutch were the greatest people in the world, and the best country in the world. I have always wanted to visit.",

There is a possibility that due to his parents perhaps (never heard anyone who knew for sure) being in the US on a diplomatic passport that technically he was not a US citizen. (Quirk of US citizenship law interpretation.)\n\nBut in all likelihood he was a US citizen (legally speaking) which would make the current King of Thailand (his son) eligible for US citizenship.  \n\nMy own add to clarity: At the time of his birth it was unlikely that he would have became king and his father was in the US at university.\n\nhttps://theculturetrip.com/asia/thailand/articles/born-in-the-usa-thailands-beloved-king-and-his-american-connections/",

Pure Jus Soli was the case in Ireland up until the late 90's and in the latter part of that period was added to the constitution of Ireland. \n\nOnly as of 2005 has a more limited version of Jus Soli been enacted, where you are entitled to citizenship only if one of your parents has lived in Ireland for three years out of the last four (or if they have indefinite leave to remain).\n\nIn fact many countries have moved to this sort of restricted Jus Soli system in recent years.

Japan didn't give citizenship through a child's mother for a very long time (until 1985), and there were a lot of kids born to American military fathers and Japanese mothers, who didn't get citizenship because the fathers fucked off back to the States without claiming the child as their own (they'd be eligible for US citizenship, but only if the father claimed the child... You can't just show up at the embassy and say hey this kid's American). These children (many were grown up by the time the law changed) had to fight this out in court.",

It is allowed to have an application process or waiting period though. For example, they can give some kind of provisional identity card to the child as a minor, and require the person to wait until they're 18 to apply for proper citizenship.",

During those years my dad was in the visa section.\n\nHe had an airman come to him asking to get his daughter a US passport so they could go back to the US, as she had been born in Japan. He assumed that since he was American she would be. After looking into it my dad tells him he can\u2019t give his daughter a passport because she isn\u2019t American. Not only that, he has to revoke the airman\u2019s citizenship because HE isn\u2019t American.\n\nIt turns out that this guys grandfather had settled in Japan after some conflict and had a son - who was American because his father was American and he met the required years lived in US to transfer citizenship. This airman\u2019s father was born and raised in Japan, got married and had a kid - the airman. The father had never once lived in America. Eventually the guy grew up and joined the Air Force and when prompted for his proof of citizenship he just said his dad was American, which is true, but not sufficient to grant HIM citizenship.\n\nThis made that guy legally Japanese and they had to work with their government to get him Japanese citizenship (which they didn\u2019t want to give him) so they could then naturalize him and his family.\n\nAs a person who was a natural born US citizen abroad, I always get a kick out of this stuff. I\u2019ve got a piece of paper that acknowledges my natural US citizenship, but I also have a foreign birth certificate from apartheid-era South Africa that identifies me as an \u201calien\u201d.",

When he went to get his first passport in 2011, he had to prove that his dad had spent a consecutive decade in the US prior to him going to Canada in 1947, which is when my grandfather met my grandfather.\n\nMy dad got some census records and even got some random employment records since the company Granddad had worked at was still around. Nevertheless it wasn\u2019t enough. He ended up writing our senator (Amy Klobuchar) and her office had to intervene just so he could get a passport.\n\nIronically, he needed a passport to go to Canada where he also has citizenship.",

If you're born in France of non-French parents: You get French citizenship at 18 if you can prove you've lived in France for at least 5 years between the age of 11 and 18. You can get it earlier if you can prove you've lived exclusively in France between the age of 8 and 13. Usually, school attendance is proof enough.\n\nAnd we have bonus one, you can get French citizenship at 18 without being born in France and without French parents by having a sibling born in France who obtained the French citizenship (so a sibling who completed the Jus Soli path to citizenship). Aside from having such a sibling, you also need to have been living in France since the age of 6 and have been enrolled in the education system the whole time.",

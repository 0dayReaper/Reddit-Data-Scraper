If Arab influence is your main concern then maybe stop being Muslim? Islam literally comes from Arabia. The sacred language of the Qur\u2019an is in Arabic. \n\nThis portrayal of \u201cArab Islam \u201c also exists in Turkey. It\u2019s dumb, because it implies that Islam practiced in the Middle East is homogeneous.\n\nThese Indonesians or Turks don\u2019t even realise how much diversity is in the Middle East, and I\u2019m not just talking about religions in general but Islam itself.\n\nIn the Middle East, you have Twelver Shias and Sunni Islam. But you also have Alawite and Alevis in Syria and Turkey. You also have the Sulaymani Ismaili Shia in Najran, Saudi Arabia. You also have Ibadi in Oman. You also have Zaydi Shia in Yemen.\n\nAlso even in the Middle East you have different school of thoughts within Islam that is significant. Such as Hanafi, Shafi, Hanbali, Maliki and Jafari. What about Islamic theology? Maturidi, Athari and Ashari is significant in the Middle East, and it is still applied. \n\nTell me the different kinds of Islam in Indonesia? Well, it\u2019s Sunni Islam but also a insignificant amount of Twelver Shias and Ahmadis. When it comes to school of thoughts it is 99% predominantly Shafi. When it comes to Islamic theology is 99% predominantly Ashari. They may have diverse Sufi orders but this also very much exists in the Middle East. \n\nSorry for the rant but people portraying it as \u201cArab Islam\u201d pisses me off. It\u2019s less about Arab culture but more about influential Muslim scholars influencing others and spreading it.",

After the 211 demonstrations and the very real possibility of an Islamist coup d'etat however, the nationalist lynchpins have been less than friendly towards these organizations. They are basically only kept alive to be used for expedient political ends.\n\nPolitically, the eastern Islanders are mostly aligned with the nationalist party of PDIP and/or Golkar, both of which are against the islamists. PDIP enjoys broad support in the Javanese heartlands. So politically speaking, the eastern Islanders have more in common with the plurality Javanese than the more fundamentalist Sumatrans. This is an oversimplification of course. And there are grievances over the centralization of development mainly in the island of Java. However this has changed drastically with the current president Jokowi (from PDIP) who emphasizes development in the outer islands.\n\nThe main political divide is Islamist - Nationalist. Most traditional islamists tend to either vote for the nationalists or more moderate NU- affiliated islamic parties, who are probably between the Muhammadiyah modernist islamists and the nationalists in terms of policy. As such there is considerable common interest for the religious minorities to side with the more tolerant Javanese.\n\nThe Islamist parties consistently lose out against the nationalists, and the various nationalist parties basically court the Islamist parties for their support, only to use them as pawns to achieve power over other nationalist parties. As such there is no immediate danger of Indonesia turning Islamist.\n\nYou can see this dynamic in the NU - PDIP alliance and Gerindra - Muhammadiyah/Modernist (PAN, PKS) alliance during the previous presidential elections. Lo and behold, after losing the election, the Gerindra candidate Prabowo promptly dropped the alliance and joined the coalition, and is now minister of defence. There are leaked interviews confirming that this was his plan all along even if he had won - he would have promptly dropped the islamists (in typical Soeharto fashion) and seek to consolidate his own power.\n\nIn order to truly understand Indonesia, one has to understand the Javanese and their philosophy. They are masters of compromise, they are the glue which holds Islamic Western Indonesia and Christian Eastern Indonesia together. The Javanese are well known for avoiding open conflict in order to work behind the scenes (sometimes using violent means - but always under a veil of secrecy; see Soeharto's toppling of Soekarno). Religiously speaking, sociologists have described them as a Dharmic (Hindu-Buddhist) society with a veneer of Islam on the surface. The NU (the biggest islamic organization in Java), while being definitively Islamic, holds a form of Islam influenced with Sufism that is more palatable to local ideas of belief. If you are familiar with Indonesian history, you will notice that they have only been islamized for a relatively short period of time (since the 1600s) compared to the Sumatrans (c. 1300), and Hindu gods and folklore still pervade every corner of Javanese society. Throughout Nusantaran history, they have been the predominant hegemonic power in the archipelago, save for a short period of time after the fall of Majapahit and the Dutch conquest of Mataram. This is, however, changing: more and more Javanese are becoming converted to a more radical kind of Islam, accelerated by the massive influx of Saudi money into madrasahs and pesantrens (Islamic schools).",

All the major Islamic empires collapsed, and the Muslim world was colonized. towards the end and after the colonial era, many Muslim intellectuals started to become more fundamentalist by doing soul searching to go back to the original circa 550 AD version of Islam,without the influence of the Islamic golden age and later European cultural imports during colonialism. The Wahabis in the gulf, the deobandis in South Asia etc, the Muslim brotherhood, basically saw that centuries of trade and later colonialism corrupted the true nature of Islam and Islam had invited too much Bidah (Innovation), and pushed back against the secular leadership that had taken over most Muslim countries by the early 1900\u2019s.",

Catholicism is the traditional religion, it has its problems but is very moderate and tied with local culture. But most Latin American countries nowadays have 1/3 to 1/2 Protestant populations. Funded by American missionaries, they tend to be more fundamentalist and lean father Right in politics (Bolsonaro is a Protestant).\n\nIt's the difference between religion being a background aspect of local culture and a vector for forcing that culture to adopt undesirable beliefs.\n\nFor a slightly more controversial example, take Xinjiang in China. They have been Muslim for hundreds of years, but within the last thirty or so missionaries from Saudi Arabia have spread Arabic strains of Islam, especially Wahhabism, in the region. Certain ways men should wear their beards, ways women should veil themselves, and radical Islamist political extremism. And the governments attempts to tamp down these new fads are seen by some as anti-Islam when in fact none of these things are endemic to traditional Islam in Xinjiang.\n\nBasically it is the difference between \"Our customs and morals are rooted in Islam but we are first and foremost people of our local culture\" and \"Being Muslim means looking and acting like an Arab Islamist\".",

Generally speaking both its supporters and opponents characterize it as an attempt to to back to the way things were in antiquity but for the most part it has little in common with actual ancient practices and is more about intellectuals and religious leaders attempting to resurrect an idealized version of the past.  Sort of like how you sometimes hear people in the US talking about wanting to take the country back to the good ol' days of the '50s while ignoring both the bad side of things (racism, sexism, the constant paranoia of the Cold War) and the neutral or good things that they disagree with (like a 90% tax rate for the rich).",

            "comment": "So, a lot of people have talked about the distinction between Modernist and Traditional Islam in the context of Indonesia, but there are a few other potential points of confusion for outsiders here.  Until very recently the Indonesian government only officially recognized 6 religions (well, 5, but Catholicism and Protestantism were recognized separately rather than as branches of Christianity), Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism.  Other religions weren't banned necessarily, and the government stated early on that it explicitly would not ban Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Shinto, or Taoism, but until 2017 all Indonesian citizens were identified by their religion on their ID cards and could only choose from the 6 officially recognized religions.  \n\nSince 2017 people have been allowed to leave the religion space blank if they're either non-religious of follow religions that aren't officially recognized by the government, but before then a lot of people would register with what they considered to be the closest to them.  So for instance, followers of Eastern or Oriental Orthodoxy were lumped into the same category as Protestants, the Chinese community generally registered as either Buddhist or Confucian, even if they identified more with Taoism or Chinese folk religion (though with Chinese religion it's usually a blend of all 4), and several indigenous peoples who maintained their traditional beliefs registered as Hindu despite having no connection to Hinduism of either the Indian or Balinese/Javanese traditions, that's who makes up the spot of Hinduism in Borneo, local tribes practicing their own local religion but registering as Hindu for the sake of convenience.",

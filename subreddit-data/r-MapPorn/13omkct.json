And indeed, most lost power after apartheid came to an end. That doesn't change the fact that the government of South Africa was still responsible for the apartheid system.",

The **one** condition that Israel has placed on Palestine in the dozens of peace talks, land offers, and evacuations of Jewish settlements over the past 75 years has been that Palestine not be an apartheid state. The Palestinian leadership point blank refused every time. This behavior even predates the establishment of the state of Israel. I don't what physical laws exist in your universe, but, for most of us, the effects can't predate the cause.",

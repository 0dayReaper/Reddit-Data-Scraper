In Proto-Slavic, this name generally denoted the Neo-Latin peoples, in the Vlasi and Vlahi versions.  The word is an adaptation of Old High German walhisc ('New Latin');  this ultimately comes from the name of an unspecified Celtic tribe, and is etymologically related to the English word Welsh;  in German, the name Welschland was used until recent times, which included Italy, Spain and France. In Hungarian, ol\u00e1h was born from two versions of the Slavic word, on the one hand, and ~;  the consonant congestion at the beginning of the word was resolved with the vocalization of v: Vlasz \u21e8 Ulasz \u21e8 Olasz.\n\n\"Orsz\u00e1g\" just means country and many country names have it appended to them, similarly how you would add \"land\" to some country names in English e.g. Finland",

Hungarian \"s\" is the \"sh\" sound in other languages and Hugarian \"sz\" is the \"s\" sound in other languages.   \nSo yes \"spanyol\" is almost the same as \"espa\u00f1ol\".\n\nN\u00e9met comes from Slavic \"nemac\" which was their word for the Germans and it means \"unintelligible speech / mute\". \n\nOlasz also comes from Slavic \"vlasi\" which itself came from old high Germanic \"walhaz / walhisc\" (cognate with English Welsh) and originally it might have been the name of a Celtic tribe within the Roman Empire, but it came to mean \"Latin-speaking foreigner\".  Up until fairly modern times Spain, France and Italy were reffered to as Welschland even in German. In Polish Italy is also called Wlochy to this day.\n\nA fun little addendum that we do refer to the geographical region of Italy as \"It\u00e1lia\" if we're talking about it either in a geographical sense or before the Italian unification. And in older documents Italians are often referred to as \"talj\u00e1n\" but no one calls them that anymore. \n\nAnd on the topic of Poland we call them \"lengyel\" because the tribe we were in contact with prior to Poland as a state was established were called the \"[Lendians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lendians)\".",

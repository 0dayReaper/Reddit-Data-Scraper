Countries are shaped and positioned according only to which countries (and seas) they border.\n\nIf you'd like a challenge, here's [a version without country labels](https://i.imgur.com/RLc3Iu5.png), and if you'd like a slightly smaller challenge, here's [one with only a few labels](https://i.imgur.com/fPijj2c.png).\n\nI made this in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), and put a brief write-up [here](https://tafc.space/qna/the-topologists-world-map/), if you're interested. Please let me know if you find any errors/typos.\n\nA few caveats: I had to ignore a few exclaves and territories to make this map at all feasible. Most notably, Russia's Kaliningrad Oblast, the Spanish exclaves in Morocco, the Angolan exclave that borders the Republic of the Congo, the British Mediterranean exclaves (Gibraltar and the two on Cyprus), and - the biggest and baddest - French Guyana.\n\n---\n**Edit:** Here's [an updated version](https://i.imgur.com/YS9uTLp.png) with the Bolivia/Paraguay/Argentina/Chile area fixed - thanks, /u/agcuevas\n\n[And another](https://i.imgur.com/qGVyb50.png), having fixed the South Sudan/Ethiopia/Kenya/Uganda border - thanks, /u/qpalks\n\n/u/Zaragoza23 pointed out that Bahrain is missing, but that'll take a while to fix\n\n---\n\nFinally, here's a list of /r/MapPorn's favourite exclaves, sorted by number of comments saying I missed them:\n\n\n\nExclave | Number of comments\n---|---\nFrench Guyana | 83\nKaliningrad | 63\nSaint Martin | 30\nCeuta and Melilla (Spain) | 20\nDubrovnik (Croatia) | 15\nNakhchivan (Azerbaijan) | 14\nGibraltar | 13",

So with the borders in Baarle-Hertog/Nassau as complicated as they are, and crossing the Dutch-Belgian border being illegal, you have people who can't go to the store across the street, or a grocery store I read about lately whose liquor store section is on the Belgian side and so has to stay closed while the rest of the shop is open, and their Dutch workers/patrons aren't allowed to walk over to that part of the store. It's pretty hilarious.\n\n[Here's](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/world/europe/Baarle-Hertog-Nassau-belgium-netherlands-coronavirus.html) a good article from the NYT; there are a bunch in Dutch news sources (and probably Belgian too, I'd imagine) if you don't mind Google translate.",

(In fact, the treatment of Indonesia in your map is somewhat strange.) Similarly, it would nice to see island chains as disconnected dots in the ocean. This is more consistent with the concept of topology.\n\nFinally, putting borders for bodies of water could be interesting, but that might make the whole thing messy.\n\nEdit: Reading more about your reasoning, it seems like what you care most about is \"which countries border which other countries (or seas).\" But really, that seems more graph-theoretic than topological. Still, very cool.",

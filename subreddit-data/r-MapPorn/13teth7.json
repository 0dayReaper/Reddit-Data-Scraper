The thing was that Dobrudzha was and is populated by Bulgarians. Same thing with Transilvania. It was given to Hungary, even if the Hungarians were less reliable ally - because it was populated with Hungarians. And Slovakia was pro-nazi from the moment it became an independent country. So maybe small border regions would be given to Hungary, but I doubt they would have gotten much more.",

This is a gold mine for authors who specialise in that genre.\n\nMy point was to say, by using one example, that it is by no means certain that Hitler would not turn on Hungary in the same way as he first turned on Russia. Or England and France, even though he promised peace at Munich. Hitler was good at convincing people he would cooperate with them forever...and then turn on them and attack.\n\nAs for your points:\n\n1. If Germany won the war. The Auschwitz complex would \"process\" the whole population of Hungary within 3 years. Even less, with post war materials to build extensions to that complex. With the last Hungarian dead, Hungary was not anything more than geography. \n\n2. If Germany won the war, the whole Wehrmacht was available to suppress uprisings. There would have been no chance of survival.\n\n3. There was no logical reason for Hitler to start WW2. No reason to invade Russia. If Hitler had stopped after the Munich Agreement,  he would have lived as a hero till his old age. If Stalin had invaded Poland to get to Germany,  Hitler would not only have had a lot of warning of a Russian advance. The point being that logic had nothing to do with Hitler. If he wasn't logical about starting the war in 1939, he wouldn't suddenly become logical and not attack Hungary.",

This is assuming that history diverged with Germany succeeding in Operation Barbarossa, and that eventually Britain (and the USA) made peace with the Germans, leaving Germany in control of the continent. \n\nUnder that scenario, presumably Germany would rule Europe partially directly but as much through compliant regimes with varying degrees of internal autonomy, including Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, Slovakia, Finland, Italy, Spain, maybe Vichy Fance and some sort of collaborationists regimes to be assembled in The Netherlands, Norway, and Denmark... and Hungary. I expect it would have been something like how the Central European states were controlled by the USSR during the Cold War, only this time there would be no NATO to provide an alternative and rival...",

There's some people living in the country outside the cities, but the absolute majority of the population lives in the cities. So there might be a much smaller sample volume, don't know how that would affect it though.",

That is to say, we imagine that we're the one's fucking the female talent. We don't want to see fat/gross/ugly men (generally) in porn, not because we're gay and are turned on by attractive guys, but because we don't want to think of ourselves as fat/gross/ugly.\n\nSimilarly, we want to see big dicks because we want to think that of ourselves.\n\nThis is a gross simplification of course and there are other reasons and nuances.",

They realized before anyone else (and were sworn to secrecy by the US government) because every, single piece of Kodak film produced after a certain date was coming out of the factory with spots of pre-exposed random dots all over the film. They eventually figured out what could be causing it - radioactive chemicals widely dispersed over the entire country, including the water sources they were pulling water from for their manufacturing process.",

                            "comment": "After we nuked Japan they hatched a long-term revenge plan on us by slowly converting the dredges of our society into weird weeb hentai enthusiasts. Unfortunately this plan backfired on Japan and the weebs were attracted to Japan's own high radiation levels, thus facilitating a massive migration of otaku dorks to mainland Japan. Since then top Japanese scientists have corrected this mistake by infecting US groundwater with small amounts of radioactive material. The initial plan was to get existing weebs out of Japan and back to the American mainland. Unfortunately it backfired yet again (Japanese aren't great at planning ahead), and Japan has more weebs than ever and now America is overrun with these dorks as well.\n\nThe downfall of civilization is not going to come out come about from nuclear war. Instead, the end of civilization is going to occur because slowly we're all going to turn into a bunch of reclusive slobs jerking off to (very childlike) cartoons in between rage posting on the internet about how much women suck. The very last person alive will die making that stupid ahegao face.\n\nParadoxically, the only way to prevent this is to announce the existence of the world's biggest LoliconCon in Tokyo, and create a scholarship for anybody who wants to attend so that they can do so for free. Once they have all gathered there (and assuming they haven't suffocated each other with the force of their own collective stench) we hit him with every nuke we've got. We boil the surface of the earth clean. Sorry Tokyo, it was always going to end this way.",

Though you'd probably have to be irradiated to use PornHub as your source for hentai.\n\nedit: looking at it more, there's some pretty cool data there. Men and women were equally favoring terms like Japanese, Mature, and Hentai. Gen Z is all about that Hentai whereas Boomers couldn't give a shit. Interesting to see cultural trends over time.",

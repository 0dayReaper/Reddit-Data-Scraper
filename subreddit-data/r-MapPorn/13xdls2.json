The local kids were interested in seeing the Hellenes that were apparently liberating them. A Greek officer told one of the local kids \"Boy, you ARE a Hellene\" to which the boy responded \"No we are *Romaioi*\".",

Then the European powers came to establish Greece and reintroduced the old Hellen stuff to Greek speaking people in the Ottoman Empire. That means, if the language didn't use by Eastern Romans and didn't survive, there will be nothing called \"Greece\" and \"Greek People\". Today's Greeks aren't descendants of the ancient Greeks but the descendants of the Byzantium",

Not that the empire had not been divided before, but this time the separation was final, the Western Empire collapsed less than a century later, while the Eastern Empire, albeit between ups and downs, survived another millennium.\n\n[Source](https://www.worldhistory.org/image/11818/western--eastern-roman-empire-395-ce/)",

In any case, the two sides influenced each other and the Eastern Empire tried to impose emperors on the West. When Odoacer deposed Romulus Augustus in 476 and did not appoint another emperor, he sent the imperial insignia back to Constantinople, so it can be assumed that at least formally Odoacer considered himself subject to the emperor of Constantinople. It was then Justinian who tried to reunify the Empire, although his conquests did not last long.",

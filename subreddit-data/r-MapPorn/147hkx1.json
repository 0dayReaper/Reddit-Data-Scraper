Well, you can also drink it solo, but it's not common.\n\nOn the other hand you drink amari without mixing them, often at the end of a big meal. For example, on sunday I use to drink it after lunch, or if I eat out.  Usually you drink about 2cl of an Amaro.\n\nUnicum and Jagermaister are two amari and they are common outside Italy, even if I think people mix them.\n\nPeople in Argentina mix Fernet Branca with Coke, it's a good cocktail, not so common here TBH.",

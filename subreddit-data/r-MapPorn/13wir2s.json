They are called an \"aggregate fruit\" - type of fruit which **one flower** contains **several separate ovaries**, which merge during development.\n\nAnd *morwa* (mulberry) is called a \"collective fruit\" - fruit made of small fruits, **each with its ovary developed from several flowers**.\n\nWe say *jagody ja\u0142owca* 'juniper berries' but we wouldn't thought that *dodaj jag\u00f3d* \"add some berries\" means that we should add anything other than bilberry. Because \"berries\" in the culinary sense are called *owoce mi\u0119kkie* = \"soft fruit\" (they are not good for transport and storage).\n\nBTW. We borrowed from English \"goji\" (fruit of wolfberry)  &gt; \"goji berries\" &gt; \"berries(fruit) of goji\" (*jagody goji*) so now because of our grammatical cases we call it *goja* and pronounce it *goya* ;)\n\nIt looks like that: [jagoda vs. bor\u00f3wka](https://www.reddit.com/r/etymologymaps/comments/yfs6c6/comment/iu6cdtu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) \\- *bor\u00f3wka* is also local name in some regions.",

Sweet type is czere\u015bnia which in English...is also usually translated as cherry.\n\nMost Poles will use different Polish word depending which picture of fruit they see while using the same English word for both.",

It wasn't until he visited me in North Wales, where wild bilberry bushes grow all over the place, that he had the revelation that blueberries &amp; bl\u00e5b\u00e4r aren't the same thing.",

As far as I know, blueberries in Greek are called *vatomoura* (\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1), with *moura* (\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1) literally meaning berries.",

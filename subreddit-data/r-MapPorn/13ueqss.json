It's because that unlike all the most previous surveys, a big part of the people didn't replied to the question (19% of don't know). In the same survey, 15% support another legal way to recognize gay unions, and only 7% is strictly against all of it. (https://fr.statista.com/statistiques/1311615/opinion-marriage-pour-tous-france/)\n\nIf you look at other surveys, it's generally higher:\n\n-79% for 2019 Eurobarometre (6% of don't know)\n\n-73% for 2017 Pew Research center (4% of don't know)\n\n-67% for 2015 BVA (2% of don't know)\n\n\nSo yeah, we can easily assume that in reality, the support for gay marriage in France is more around 70-75% than \"only\" 50-59% as shown in the graph.",

Just pointed out that taking only one study can be misleading, especially since in this one a big part of the people didn't answer the question, but if we take other recent studies where people tend to reply more to the question, we always end up with a way higher % of people supporting gay marriage, that's all. So your data aren't wrong at all, but just quite misleading when it comes to describe realtiy, I do believe it would have been more interesting to calculate the average % of yes between the most recent studies to get a better despiction of reality.\n\nBecause at the end, as I pointed out in France the support for same sex marriage is in reality higher than 50-59%, we get lots of people in the comments led to believe that France is way less accepting than other european countries, or even is more homophobic, because lots of muslims/far right people... Just because of a misleading data, lots of people get their biais confirmed, or get a biaised view/understanding of a situation. Maps like these always deserve lots of attention to make sure to not mislead people.",

It has given sections of the population permission to express prejudices they often didn\u2019t even know they had before. At the same time, it has shifted the whole political discourse very far to the right, so that even centre-left politicians now repeat bigoted and nativist slogans. The underlying reason for this is that the pro-Brexit movement appeals to those who blame their personal failures and disappointments on other people, groups or external agencies. \n\nLiving in London I am somewhat aloof from this upsurge in prejudice of various kinds. It is no coincidence that London (along with Scotland and several major English cities) voted heavily against Brexit. \n\nAnother important factor is the adversarial nature of our political system, which favours rigid and binary solutions over discussion and compromise. The trans issue, which you mention, is a case in point. It is a complex question, requiring compromise and consensus-seeking rather than ideological fault lines and culture wars. However the way we \u2018do\u2019 politics is not conducive to this because of its emphasis on \u2018robust debate\u2019 between \u2018opposing sides\u2019 with entrenched \u2018positions\u2019, rather than attempting to find common ground and work together to resolve complex issues for the benefit of all parties. There are honourable exceptions, most notably the Good Friday agreement on Northern Ireland; this involved a lot of input from the Irish Republic, which has a more consensus-seeking form of politics with a more representative electoral system and frequent coalitions.",

This is from an Ipsos poll in 2021 that gives UK 68%, but a YouGov poll from this year put it at 73% (which put it in the highest colour catagory). This map also uses multiple sources form different years, so is not comparable.\n\nAlso colour schemes can be misleading. UK could 69% and Ireland could be 70% and they'd be put in different colour brackets, which makes it appear worse than it is. That the problem with these sorts of maps.\n\nEdit: to prove my point, here is a link the 2021 Ipsos poll, when taking just yes/no responses, and UK comes 4th highest. So you can make the data say ifferent things depending on what you look at.\n\n[https://www.equaldex.com/surveys/ipsos-lgbt-pride-2021-global-survey](https://www.equaldex.com/surveys/ipsos-lgbt-pride-2021-global-survey)\n\nEdit: Adiiotnally, the Ipsos poll quoted for many European countries on the map gives overall lower scores than other polls. I.e. UK get 69% in Ipsos, but gets 77% in YouGove, or 84% when removing \"neither\" ption. The Ipsos poll gives US 58%, below most western European countries, even though individual states look higher on this map. So it just shows the problems of comparing random, unrelated polls.",

The thing is that I believe a myriad of factors come in play, which boil down to how countries treat their population. Just two countries to the north we've seen that doing nothing and throwing minorities under the bus with false accusations of kindergarten subsidy fraud has set emancipation back for an entire generation, and may even have contributed to extra votes for RTE in Turkey, and have been discouraged to integrate into Dutch society. But each country is different. France has had a hard time to do things right in the banlieues, but that doesn't mean that things will always stay the same. It is important to note that higher physical and social mobility will result in demographics looking different in the future.\n\nI believe that even if not many muslims will fully abandon their faith, that there will be a big part that is nominally muslim as a result of generations passing by and development in an agnostic society ongoing: that is to say that they don't do a lot with it, interpret things more loosely but also won't fully abandon their faith. These tend to be much more liberal in their approach to society. A perfect example are my father and stepmother, whom are muslim, and whom also have embraced me and helped me being a transgender woman. Not abandoning their faith, but interpreting it in a way that fits to modern society.",

Surveys can always be misleading, this is why it always matters to look at them in globality, a single survey isn't a total representation of reality (in that case I could use the 2019 survey and claim everywhere that around 80% of french people roots for gay marriage, it would be as misleading).\n\nFar right is on the rise in the elections, but it deserves to be seen with more context. Far right party is rising not just because white French people suddenly turned out to be homophobic and racist. The two major moderate party kinda vanished within the last 10 years, leaving only once major center-right party, which is Macron's Party. Left, as always, is divided, and since Macron is hated by lot of people (especially working classes), they turned toward the only major opposition, Le Pen's Party. It's a protest vote, just like lot of people voted for Biden against Trump, or lot of people voted for Trump against Clinton.\n\nSo, at the end, not every Le Pen's voters are homophobic. In 2017, when Le Pen's party was second in the Presidential election with 21%, the vice-president of the Party was Philippot, a homosexual, everyone knew that. And in the last election, the only Far right party openly and strictly against LGBT stuff and gay marriage was Zemmour's Party, which only got 7%...\n\nNot saying that there is no opposition to gay mariage here, not at all, there are still millions of people opposed to it, especially the very religious persons (christians and muslims), but even combined, it's delusional to believe these persons represents 40% of French population, that would just be false.\n\nBut anyway, obviously you're not here looking for facts, context nor discussion, you just seemed to enjoy seeing a misleading map confirming your biais and getting triggered when someone pointed it out. So believe whatever you want and whatever makes you feel good, if you want to believe that France is the most homophobic or the most pro-LGBT country in Europe, do so, it won't change the reality here. Not even sure you'd even make the effort to read that comment.",

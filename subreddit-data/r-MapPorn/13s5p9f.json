Inall its forms, it is the removal of a person\u2019s freedom \u2014 their freedom to accept or refuse a job, their freedom to leave one employer for another, or their freedom to decide if, when, and whom to marry \u2014 in order to exploit them for personal or financial gain.\"\n\nEdited because it got messed up with the copy/paste",

They have subjugated whole non Han racial groups for work camps and organ harvesting that have demographics of whole nations due to the irony of them needing cheap labor and organs for their aging population. The rest of it is just underreported middle eastern countries, but it's standard because they are still medieval monarchies with jets and oil production who haven't discovered underpaid college women on the tech tree. Plus the whole destabilization of South America seems kind of weird that there is underreported slavery. I feel like North Korea is the only honest number on here and even then 2.6 million people is still half than the American prison population. CPS still hasn't sold all those Honduran kids from Trump admin. Covid and Climate Change has slowed down human trafficking or low demand and high supply. I feel like this is based on weirder criteria of slavery being more than people who don't have human rights and are forced to do manual labor under state guidelines. It's weird too with Elon getting his Neurolink FDA approval after a suspicious amount of Texas inmates dying suddenly.",

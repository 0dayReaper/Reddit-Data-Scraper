Yes, it's most frequently used to build concentrations of demographics for easy seat wins. But it can also just as effectively be used to remove competition from other seats.\n\nSay you have 2 districts with a 30% contingency of opposition voting population, and your party will win or lose the seat with a 10% swing either way. By removing that population from both districts into a third district, the opposition now will always win that 3rd district, while you now will always take those other 2 districts for yourself.",

Gerrymandering doesn't want \"very safe\" seats for the party in charge. They want seats that they'll win by about 8-10 points in a neutral, as that's enough to survive most waves.

You can see this in pack and crack districting that's about shaping the overall makeup of the house delegation, rather than the particular district itself. So a D+33 district is a safe seat, but it also means a bunch more R seats elsewhere in the state.\n* Linking communities of interest is done to ensure that people have a voice in Washington that truly represents their interest, regardless of political party. So, like, you could have a weird looking district that comprises &lt;COMMUNITY&gt;, and it wouldn't matter that much whether it goes blue or red because they'll still be representing those people. \n\nThe districts in Chicago that everyone makes fun of are often an artifact of redlining policies that prevented people of color from moving into white neighborhoods, resulting in a black community to the north and south of an island of whiteness. It's a tricky thing to figure out how to district that, and it turns out it's not as simple as just drawing squares over the landscape.",

Drawing it that way *actively harms* the party that was in charge of drawing the districts of Illinois (democrats), but their hands were legally tied.\n\nIt's the reverse scenario of gerrymandering, where the party in charge tries to give themselves an electoral benefit (which *did* happen in most of the rest of Illinois, among many other states).",

If you take a historic black community and make it a district, are you disenfranchising the voters, gerrymandering, or even racially cutting them from the electoral?\n\nUnfortunately, if we divy up that district, then the have a say in the elections of several Congress members and even contribute to a victory in those districts for their party. \n\n\nHowever this doesn\u2019t equate to representation for them. It might end up that this black community ends up with three or four white people of their party to represent them if they were 'degerrymandered' instead of having one or two black people (if the community matched the districts) and possibly from their community itself. \n\nIs one more representative than the other? It's a tough call. On the one hand their voice could get drowned out by opposition voices through gerrymandering. In another case they get amplified where they overlap with those voices outside the community and muted on issues exclusive to the community. And in the case where it matches the community, their voice may be quieter but it truly would reflect the needs of that community.",

This is essentially what has happened in North Carolina recently; the previous map was considered a Republican gerrymander, so they made a deal which gave the Democratic Party two more seats, and made all seats on the new map extremely safe.\n\nOne can also do the opposite and gerrymander for extremely competitive elections, but this generally isn't done since neither party really likes the risk that comes with that.\n\nFinally, one can gerrymander to try to get a result which matches the proportions people voted for each party (good luck doing this in a 3+ party system). This is effectively a mild gerrymander in favour of the Democratic party, since a map drawn only considering population tends to slightly benefit the Republican party due to the distribution of each party's voters.",

The consequence of Gerrymandering is that a party can receive a minority of the vote but get the majority of representatives. There are several ways to gerrymander, and it can be quite complicated since you can use computers to draw the districts. The most common method is to pack similar people into few districts, so they\u2019re not represented proportionally to their population. \n\nThe US Supreme Court has ruled that racial gerrymandering is unconstitutional, but not partisan gerrymandering. In other words, it\u2019s illegal to put all the black people in one district preventing them from getting more than one representative. But you are allowed to pack all the Democrats or Republicans into a district. \n\nContext: every 10 years the US conducts a census and redraws congressional districts. States with bigger populations get more districts (ie more reps in the House). Whichever party is in power in each state was traditionally in charge of drawing the congressional maps. Obvious conflict of interest right? So, several states now have independent commissions that draw the maps. \n\nOne thing to note here. Gerrymandering is a consequence of our single member districts. So you can\u2019t \u201cend gerrymandering\u201d under the current system. It\u2019s impossible. And there\u2019s a whole debate of what criteria districts should be drawn on: competitiveness, fairness, etc. \n\nEtymology: Gerrymandering is named after Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry. In 1812, a district in Boston was drawn which resembled a salamander.",

It was specifically created by Republican politicians in the state to give the latino population representation, literally suing their own state board of elections to claim that the previous map with the un-gerrymandered 4th district was unconstitutional on, among other reasons, 14th amendment grounds.\n\nNow, just to be clear, previous lawsuits on redistricting had ended with the court system finding that the 14th amendment *did require* that redistricting processes give minority groups, if their population is both high enough and geographically concentrated enough, gerrymandered districts to ensure that their voting power is approximately what it should be.\n\nThe Illinois 4th district meets all of these requirements, and thus its creation is mandated by both federal law and supreme court precedent.",

Imagine you have a country that is 70% group A and 30% group B, and that people will only vote for candidates of their own group. In terms of representation group B could have anywhere from 0% of representatives (every district is perfectly representative) to 30% (groups are perfectly separated) to something like 50% (perfect gerrymandering in favor of B). I think we can all agree that anything significantly over 30% is unfair, but having 0% representation is also extremely punitive to the minority group. Creating some majority-minority districts is a way to move to needle away from 0% and towards 30%.",

Based on population, Nebraska gets 3 of 435 representatives to the House of Representatives. \n\nIf you did 3 equal area vertical slices, one rep would represent about 200,000 people ( West), one about 400,000 people (central), and the other about 1.4 million people. That hardly seems fair for anybody.\n\nSo the state has to try to divide based on where people are to try to get between 600,000 to 700,000 in each district. So basically Omaha gets it's own seat, but it's not a perfect square, so even if the district could just be \"Omaha city limits\" it would still look wonky based on municipal boundaries.\n\nSo what happens is that well intentioned people use a good faith effort to get the right amount of people.  Because rivers and highways are convenient for understanding which district you are, you get weird curvy lines.\n\nSo generally you end up with a weird shape because you don't have a choice.\n\nIn some instances, like the crazy one in Illinois, it's because they wanted to separate out all the Hispanics so they weren't accidentally mixed in with the non-Hispanic. So they drew a ridiculous shape to box them in and segregate them from the general population.",

Our representatives don't represent us, they can't be bothered by us and don't have time to talk to us unless they're asking for money. With a constitutional cap at 100,000 citizens per representative we can have a more beholden government that works for us, because representatives won't be as insulated from the communities that elected them. Yes that would mean the House would have over 3000 seats and I say \"so what?\" to that. We build grand stadiums that hold 20 times that number like it's going out of style. We can afford a 5000 seat auditorium or arena for the House. With a smaller scope of responsibility each representative need not be paid as much as they are, need not have as big a staff as they do and can focus on picking up the phone when someone in their district calls.\n\nAlso the current apportionment formula that the Census department must follow is heavily biased towards small and medium population states. Even though the average district has close-to 800,000 citizens, for a large state like Texas or California to gain another seat they need to experience population growth that far exceeds that number because they're competing against other states for a finite number of seats. As long as the population keeps growing we will become increasingly far removed from our government.",

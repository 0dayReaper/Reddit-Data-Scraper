Yes Koreans may be less hated than Chinese, but they are pretty much loathed heavily in Japan. Most older Japanese absolutely have insane loathe on Korea and don't even get me started on the LDP. In Tokyo things are fine. Outside Tokyo though in conservative rural areas nuhhuh.\n\nI am shocked Muslims are there( both in map and an according to previous comments) since Islam population in Japan is extremely low or non-existent .",

Hinduism also follows polytheism. That is in stark contrast with Islam.\n\nOn the other hand, in Islam, Jesus (Isa/Issa) is believed to be the penultimate prophet and messenger of God. Moses (Musa) is also considered a prophet in Islam.\n\nBut Ganesh, Shiva, Hanuman, Parvati, Durga, Laxmi, etc., don\u2019t fit into Islam. Nor does Buddha.",

In my personal opinion copts are the most \"egyptian\" Egyptians out there (they didn't mix with Arabs like muslim Egyptians)\n\nEgyptian nationalism is also based around coptic identity (Coptic literally means Egyptian) rather than the Arab identity of pan arabism, one of their talking points is teaching Coptic language (The descendant of ancient Egyptian language) in schools .\n\nBut I have to say this isn't something that people regularly talk about, because extreme Islamists believe that a Muslim from India or Afghanistan is closer to them than an Egyptian Christian, they have this international islamic brotherhood \"ummah\" bullcrap so they don't even have the need to claim that egyptian Christians are \"less egyptian\".",

They have an issue with someone leaving Islam to become a Christian or (especially) a Hindu.  \n2.Whether they have an issue with a Muslim woman marrying a non-Muslim man  \n3.Their views on LGBT.Even according to Pew Research, the only parts of the Muslim world where there is weak support for the death penalty are those that are in Europe(Bosnia, Kosovo and Albania), former communist states of Central Asia and three secular ones (Tunisia, Indonesia and Turkey) .In the entire Gulf, all of North Africa aside from Tunisia, most of the Sahel and Pakistan and Afghanistan, at least 60% support the death penalty for apostates.A lot of them also support death for adultery, even though such laws are actually rarer than apostasy laws.When it comes to LGBT, while someone may claim that Christians are just as homophobic, the overwhelming majority of Christians do not call for the death penalty for LGBT(Uganda and possibly Zambia could be the exception). Imprisonment maybe(which makes no sense)This issue is ironically even more extreme amongst Muslims in the West, especially, for some reason, British Muslims. Less so amongst American Muslims . Universal almost everywhere else except for European Muslims and Turkey  \nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/",

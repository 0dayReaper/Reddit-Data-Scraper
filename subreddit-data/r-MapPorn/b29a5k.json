Like how is this at all relevant to what's going on in this comment thread?\n\n- Why do you say \"Luck of the Irish\"? How is this related to either the comment thread or your video? Like, I get it's St. Patricks day today, but how is that relevant to like, anything going on here?\n\n- What is happening in your video? You show off a campfire, grab a mug from a tree, show off an inukshuk, show off a big pile of sticks, show off some more inukshuks... Like, that's nice, but what is happening?\n\n- What does your Youtube username even mean? \"emcee lama hawk then\" seems like it's just a mess of randomly chosen words. What does it mean?\n\n- Why are people upvoting this? What is going on here that I'm missing?\n\n- The last like eight posts in your comment history have been the exact same: \"Luck of the Irish [Insert Link]\". Across several posts in several subreddits. Why?\n\n- You post a lot in r/trees. Are you doing this because you're high? If so, what are you smoking right now, because it seems really dank.\n\nI'm not upset or angry, I'm just incredibly confused.",

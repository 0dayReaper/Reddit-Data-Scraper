There are many reasons, like the fact our economy used to be extremely dependent of slavery for the cotton plantations during colonial times, or how it took s lot of time for modern industry to arrive here (like in most parts of Brazil that aren't the south and southeast). Corruption and the rule of local oligarchies don't help.",

Most people there descend from settlers coming from the Rio Grande do Sul Plateau (I think you can include Southwest Paran\u00e1 too). Most people have family in two or more of those areas (myself included). \nThe Campanha Ga\u00facha and Northern Uruguay are literally the same. Montevideo and Porto Alegre have very similar vibes, I think Montevideo is the most similar city to Porto Alegre. We say that Montevideo is Spanish-speaking Porto Alegre here. \nSerra Ga\u00facha is actually the most different from Uruguay and Northeastern Argentina (Pampas and Mesopotamia) because it is mountainous, so it has a very different feel, and although it received a lot of Italian immigrants like Buenos Aires, in Serra Ga\u00facha it was mostly Northern Italians, overwhelmingly from Veneto, and I hear in Buenos Aires it was mostly from Southern Italy; plus in Serra Ga\u00facha we have next to none Spanish influence. \nI can only speak for myself, I was born on the border with Uruguay, and I am of Spanish-Italian descent. I have always felt closer to Uruguay than any other state of Brazil (maybe except Santa Catarina, but the Florian\u00f3polis region and anything north of it are very different from Rio Grande do Sul).\nI'm speaking based on my experience, I'm not a separatist or anything and I love other parts of Brazil (bjs Nordeste). But Uruguay and Rio Grande do Sul share a lot of things: geography, history, climate, ethnic make-up, cuisine, economy, and even language (Uruguayan Portuguese/portu\u00f1ol is spoken in Northern Uruguay and even Riograndense Portuguese and Uruguayan Spanish share a lot of phonetic, syntactic and lexical features not shared with other varieties of Spanish and Portuguese), something Rio Grande do Sul does not have with Northern parts of Brazil simply because they are on the other side of the continent.",

Who is getting Brazil's spot in the UN? What about trade agreements? Mercosul?\n\nNevermind all of that, any new deal that the 2 new states try to break, they'll be worse off because both are weaker\n\nHow about the economical perspective them\n\nCutting the nation in half also halfs the nations market, all the trade, services and money, from the South and Southeast going to the northeast halts, and so does the cheap labour, resources and people(key factor in a age of demographic collapse) going south.\n\nThe instability would cause many corporations to collapse and a massive economical crises\n\nAbout the military perspective\n\nSplitting the nation in half creates not only 2 new states, but a whole ass new rivarely, the northeast now not only has to worry about its own stability but also with the south trying to meddle with it, and the South has to worry about securing its new northern borther while keeping the current Brazilian position in the La Plata region\n\n\nAnd last, the Amazon and center west\n\nWho gets it? The Amazon isnt as clear cut in the divide and both sides would want it, foreing powers would most likely make moves, i can only imagine the mess",

And the GDP per capita of the new southern Brazil is much bigger.\n\n\nGDP isnt eveything, and thats counting with the southeast, and having lived my intire life here, we arent going anywhere.\n\n&gt;If you mean Atacarejo, which is the only economic sector that really depends of the northeasteners (because they don't contribute anything to the industrial GDP and are subsidized) i'm all for it.\n\nSo you honestly think not a single company in the south uses labour from the northeast? Or resources that were mined there? Lmao\n\n\n&gt;If the Northeast keep electing the most retarded politicians possible the foreign powers are going to keep it anyway. Couldn't care less tbh.\n\nThe country elects retarded politicians\n\n&gt;Anyway, thanks for putting together a scenario like I joked about but it's still not very convincing that we wouldn't be better off. I mean, if the North+Northeast went away we'd still be one of the world's richest and biggest countries. It's basically just letting go of some clutter.\n\nThe north and northeast are literally half the nation, like, you do know thats alot, and we arent that big really maybe in a south america we are, but in a global scale, Indonesia, Nigeria and Pakistan has as many people as us",

Those same Catholics build and created a secular country. In 2003, Lula/PT Party, the new left, creates the Evangelical Bench in Congress as a pay off for the support Evangelicals (specially Neo Pentecoastal) gave him during elections. There was never a Catholic bench in Congress or Senate, despiste Brazil being over 80% Catholic at the time. 2003 changed everything and was when Evangelicals literally started stealing the Conservative and Right inclined parties and movements. Before 2003 Conservatives and Right politicians were not religion based or talked about the bible in politics. It was more a intelectual battle between left and right about how to get \"there\" better and faster, rather than cheap demagogs talking\n\nPT Party isn't just responsible for those idiotic identity politics on the left, they also created what is today the right wing Jesus freak Evangelical bench. Believe it or not, that bench used to be secular, rational and filled with decent politicians before 2003.\n\nWhen you see crazy results in obviously right inclined cities and states be sure was Catholics, Atheists, Agnostics, Kardecists not voting on the Evangelical guy/woman. PSDB Party self implosion in post 2014 presidential election  was the last slap on the face of traditional thinking moderate left and right sides. It's now a mess and no one feels represented. Not by Bolsonaro and his Evangelicals or by Lula and his narcos and transwomen. Most Brazilians are moderates center folks who just want a man or woman who's neither a crook or religious freak to be president/Governor/Mayor and keep things going.",

Leftism is about material conditions and should be inclusive so picking sides on religion doesn't seem conducive to that.\n\nSo Lula created the Evangelical bench but Bolsonaro has more support from Evangelicals now?\n\nMy friends in Brazil I'd say are center left. Not full on socialist who want to seize the means of production but people who like safety net programs, aren't very religious and are very aligned with Lula.

Brazil is an agricultural country whose exports are mainly commodities, places with better land are richer and places with worse land are poorer, the north has a giant rainforest and the northeast is mostly covered by a semi-desert making farming difficult. It's all about LAND. The northern region was also forgotten for a long time, with the government concentrating its investments in others parts of the country. \n\nThe northeast was the first region to be colonized and the Portuguese king gave huge plots of land to a small number of Portuguese aristocrats, creating enormous inequality, while in the south, the opposite happened, in order to attract immigrants, the government distributed equal plots of land to them. When someone owns something it becomes easier to negotiate and prosper. Also the Northeast and Southeast regions that received the highest number of slaves are more unequal because when the slaves were freed they were not given any land and it was difficult to find work since nobody wanted to hire, forcing them into poverty. Apparently, D. Pedro II had a plan to give land to the freed slaves, but the coup happened and took him out of power. If his plan had been put into practice, Brazil would be a much less unequal and violent country.",

The Northeast wanted tariffs, govt protecting industries, regulations, etc. \n\nThe Democrats were the rural, small govt, low tax party. \n\nNow it's not quite the same left/right divide today, as the Republicans were both pro-big business but also supported a bigger govt. Whereas nowadays usually pro-business is considered pro smaller govt. But generally speaking, the Republicans were the further left wing party back then, and Northeast then and now has been the most left wing part of the USA. \n\nAlso I'd say more pre-great depression, not pre Civil Rights movement. Again it's pretty complicated, like in the 60's the Democrats were the party of promoting govt jobs programs, welfare, and more regulations on big business. But they also had the super conservative souther democratic faction in the party. The average Republican was probably more conservative economically than a democrat at the time, but Republicans were more supportive of Civil Rights",

Well it was actually well cared for and intact up until the 16th century. Not just stone, but wooden roofs too. The Ottoman Empire decided it would be brilliant  to store gunpowder in the old temple, thinking nobody would dare shell it. Well, the Venetians did just that and turned the whole hilltop into marble chunks after it had stood for 2 millennia.\n\nSo, yeah, breaching Chernobyl's containment is absolutely a risk.",

Yes, the Ottomans briefly turned it into a mosque, but they quickly converted it to an arsenal. The Acropolis was away from populated Athens and was defensible and was a cultural touchstone for westerners...storing war material there made some tactical sense. It was also a shitty thing to do.",

It'd cost a ton, be a running sore in international relations (i.e. the sanctions won't lift for a looong time if there's still Russian troops dictating everything), and will no doubt involve some sort of low intensity war. Besides, between Belarus and the eastern chunk of Ukraine, there's space for Russian bases that will be less controversial and nearly as close.\n\nIt's cheaper and easier to threaten your kind of annexation/occupation as a bargaining chip, and negotiate down to a peace treaty that gives him what he actually wants.",

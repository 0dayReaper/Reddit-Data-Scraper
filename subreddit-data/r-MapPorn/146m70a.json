It uses more native Philippine words compared to contemporary Filipino where a lot of English is used. In the Philippines, speaking tagalog casually is closer to code switching with English. For a similar comparison, its like the difference between European French and Quebecois French.\n\nThen there is the sentence structure. Although its perfectly understandable, Tagalog can be expressed in VSO and SVO, so seeing it more rigid makes it look more conservative compared to how more loose sentences are structured. There were also some minor grammar mistakes that are pretty common to make even among us Filipinos today (ng vs nang to be specific)",

The US government passed the first immigration control laws in its history to limit and stop Chinese and Japanese immigration to California and the Pacific coast in the late 1800s. These settlers also faced large amounts of discrimination, and as such formed Chinatowns and other ethnic enclaves to protect each other. Even now, more than 150 years later, their is a sizable Chinese and Chinese American presence. Many have assimilated into mainstream American culture, but due to racism preventing them from being treated as \u201ctrue Americans\u201d combined with more recent arrivals from more Chinese people in the 1900s, due to civil war and the Communist rule of China, a unique chinese identity still exists in many of these communities.",

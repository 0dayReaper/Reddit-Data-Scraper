Perhaps the people in Rand McNally were confused and thought that Germany had annexed the whole of Czechoslovakia (except Ruthenia). \n\nIn this map, the Sudetes are included as part of Bohemia, instead of being part of Germany, that is a mistake too.",

Until 15.3.1939 there was defacto an independent Czecho-Slovak Republic - see e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second\\_Czechoslovak\\_Republic. After 15.3.1939 Slovakia declared independence (and became a satellite of Germany), Hungary occupied Subcarpathian Russia and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was declared in Bohemia and Moravia. And this state of affairs lasted until the end of the war.",

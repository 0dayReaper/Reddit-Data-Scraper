(I'm marking this as spoilers for anyone who hasn't seen the show). &gt;!Melanie was for me the best, most interesting character, and killing her off removes a lot from the show. Not to mention, that the \"final showdown\", where they split the train in two at the aquarium car (the culmination point of season 2 finale), was basically useless, becouse all that was for saving Melanie, who died anyway. One of the final scenes, where they're all smiling and \"riding away into the sunset\", was cheesy as hell, so not good for a season finale imo. They left it at a cliffhanger, so we can expect a season 3, that maybe fixes some stuff up. Now, despite all the shit, the second season had some good stuff in it. F. ex. Alex had a satisfying character arc. She switches sides, but still has the same personality. Wilford is an awesome character, with a unique personality. He's very well portrayed by Sean Bean, who is a great actor. The show in general is well cast. Every character has something interesting. !&lt; So summing up: the show has a lot of ups and downs, but in general it does a good job at entertaining people. The first season is definitely better, but the second one has it's charms too. I would personally recommend it.",

He doesn\u2019t really go into the trains, but he talks about the extreme remoteness and cost. They would need to develop highways on both sides to get to bridge because of how remote it is, and the discovery channel estimated it would cost $105 billion to build. That\u2019s like 5x the cost of the tunnel from the UK from France, which is highly trafficked, so you can see some of the large issues with the idea. But he also brings up a suggest about including a oil pipeline with the bridge, which could be quite valuable.",

You want a tunnel to be protected against the elements and not interfere with shipping (a bridge would need quite a large clearing). Maybe 90km under the sea (with a slight bend), the current record is 23km so it's not exactly completely off the scale.\n\n&gt;  In order to build that city, you have to have that highway there.\n\nNah, you'd build a railway as it's easier to do and can transport loads of material for cheap. Which also makes the highway redundant, simply load the cars onto a train it's not like we don't know how to do that. That will also avoid stupid people from having to get rescued.\n\nSo, to sum up: Build railway to the coast, using railway as transport. Once there, build a factory to build tunnel segments, lower those into a newly-dug trench ([same technique as the Fehmarnbelt crossing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmP9Ez-u9SM)), then either continue on the other side or, alternatively, meet the other construction crew there. You probably want to have the factory on the Russian side as Chukotka  is quite a bit more inhabited than Nome. Still, you'd need to stomp a city out of the ground, at the very least you will need worker barracks, but anyway it's going to be a tourist destination so why not.\n\nAs to how to get there: You probably want to start an extension to the north in roughly Solovyevsk (mid-point between Ulan Ude and Khabarovsk), going via Jakutsk, Magedan, Anadyr.",

Building a road on tundra is ridiculously expensive. Maintaining it, equally so. The obstacles to a bridge across the Bering Strait are formidable. For one, the sea freezes every winter. And that ice moves around. A lot! The weather can be deadly. Winter temperatures can be 50 to 60\u2109 below 0. Add to that the high winds andthat can put temperatures in the range of -100\u2109. And it's not just the road. You would have to build infrastructure. Things like fuel, food, and lodging would be necessary. Emergency services would have to be provided. I just don't see it ever being built.\n\nThat being said, if they ever did build it, I would be first in line to drive it!",

                                                    "comment": "People grossly underestimate the sheer size of Russia and also how unpopulated some huge sections can be. I recall reading about the German invasion into the Soviet Union in WW2. As they initially worked Eastward through Poland (or as they called it General Government) they would never be too far away from a village or a small town. Even after they initially crossed into the Soviet Union, at first they would pass by villages and then, just like that, mile after mile of nothing. No villages or towns. The soldiers, more used to Central Europe which is very densely populated found it eerie. Now imagine that multiplied by multitudes of ten in Siberia.",

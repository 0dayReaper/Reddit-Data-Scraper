            "comment": "  \n\nThe English name \u201fJune\u201d comes from Latin *iunius*, the month  of  the Roman goddess Iuno (usually spelled \u201fJuno\u201d in English), who was the  protector and special counsellor of the state. Words derived from the  same root as \u201fJune\u201d are shown on a red background on the map.\n\n**Polish** *czerwiec*, **Ukrainian** *\u010d\u00e9rven'*, **Czech** *\u010derven*, **Belarusian** *\u010d\u00e9rvjen'*, and other similar variants, are related to the Slavic name of the colour red (*\\*\u010d\u044crven\u044a*  in Proto-Slavic), likely referring to ripening apples, cherries,  strawberries, and other fruits; the name of the colour itself is derived  from *\\*\u010d\u044crv\u044c* (literally \u201fworm\u201d), which referred to a red insect  used to make red dye, and some of the names may possibly be derived  directly from *\\*\u010d\u044crv\u044c*. **Croatian** *lipanj* is the month of linden trees, which bloom in June. **Lithuanian** *bir\u017eelis* is derived from *ber\u017eas*, \u201fbirch\u201d.\n\n**Irish** *Meitheamh*, **Welsh** *Mehefin*, **Breton** *Mezheven*, and **Cornish** *Metheven* are all derived from Proto-Celtic *\\*medyo-sam\u012bno*, which meant \u201fmid-summer\u201d. **Scottish Gaelic** *\u00d2gmhios* is *\u00f2g* (\u201fnew\u201d) + *m\u00ecos* (\u201fmoon\u201d).\n\n**Finnish** *kes\u00e4kuu* is derived from *kes\u00e4* (\u201fsummer\u201d, archaically also \u201ffallow\u201d) + *kuu* (\u201fmonth\u201d), and the same is likely true for Karelian *kez\u00e4kuu*. **V\u00f5ro** *piim\u00e4kuu* literally means \u201fmilk month\u201d. **North Sami** *geassem\u00e1nnu* means \u201fsummer month\u201d.\n\n**Turkish** *haziran* is borrowed from Aramaic via Arabic, from a word referring to wheat being cut down. **Albanian** *qershor* comes from *qershi*, \u201fcherry\u201d (which, in turn, comes from a Late Latin word for a cherry). **Basque** *ekain* is probably derived from *eki* (\u201fsun\u201d) + *gain* (\u201ftop, zenith\u201d).\n\nFinally, **Sardinian** is the only Romance language on the map which uses a word not derived from *iunius*. *L\u00e0mpadas* likely comes from Latin *lampada*, \u201flamp, lantern\u201d.",

If you ever compare Slavic languages to let's say Latin, Germanic or simply to English as a whole you will notice that Slavic languages are extremely conservative in their separation. \n\nThis means that if you as a native English spear were to read \"English\" text from let's say 1000AD... You would struggle a lot. A Slavic speaker reading it's corresponding languages text from 1000AD would not Struggle that much. It's quite fascinating more so because Proto Slavic is one of the older branches of the Indo European tree. (Proto Slavic - 2nd millennium BC Vs proto Germanic 500 Bc).",

As is seen in all these names. But connected to these names and cycles was of course the belief system. Different religious and social events for different times of the year which reflected the months and an array of spirits which often were connected or came around during different times of the year.\n\nOf course, as Christianisation came it often became replaced because the events lost the nature-cycle relation and gained more association with Christian events. Spirits also faded away so working \"around them\" throughout the year became less connected to the months. \n\nIn essence it's sort of interesting that they are mainly preserved in the more self successful states and more around the Homeland of Slavs (about Eastern Poland, Western Ukraine and Southern Belarus).",

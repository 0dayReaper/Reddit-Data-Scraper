Simple things like basic Kurdish education in Schools only became legal under Erdogan, and he led the way in opening dozens of schools in Kurdish populated regions, regions that have historically been very poor and underinvested. \n\n\nPrevious nationalist governments, including the one of Ataturk persecuted kurds heavily, ataturk famously attacked civilian Kurds and in the 80s  fascists made speaking Kurdish a crime and tortured anyone who did so. Many of those fascist policies have only been abolished after Erdogan took power.",

Many dont even know that Armenians at the time invaded Eastern parts of Anatolia with the support of the Russian Empire\u2026 The reason why Armenians were forcefully relocated south was due to the very fact that they were actively involved in the war! Even the numbers going around are false.. Aside from these, not recognising an event or rather looking at an event from the opposing perspective does not equate to hating a group of people. For sure there are many people especially in Eastern Anatolia who dont like Armenians since many people there have lost relatives to Armenian attacks/raids, but it is wrong to generalise public opinion..",

These are what I heard or read at comments)\n\nTurkey might not want to lose territorial waters as Greece consider islands as part of the mainland and consider like %90 of the Aegean Sea as theirs instead of going %50 50 between 2 mainland while islands close to Turkey still belonging to Greece but Turkish ships able to sail around them. So Turkey might be thinking it's not worth to risk loosing Mediterranean borders as they see no negative or gain giving up Cyprus. Both country hope to find oil or gas in the sea, so it might be a factor too on not wanting to lose territorial waters.",

Iraqi government protests it but they can't do anything about PKK or the Turkish military so no one takes them seriously. The Turkish control there is also not very direct. Military just has bases on top of mountains and all but villages etc are not incorporated into Turkey. It's also a Kurdish majority region.",

The terms of BRI loans stipulates that construction and engineering contracts must be done with Chinese state-owned corporations. The fact that it's all handled by Chinese firms with decades of expertise and experience is one of the main allures of the BRI for developing nations. It's a mercantilist policy: Chinese money gets handed to developing nations, those nations give that money to Chinese firms that bring all their workers - even labourers - from the homeland (and leave almost nothing in terms of knowledge transfer and training of locals), and those firms take the money right back to China. It's as much of a closed loop as possible, and that's one of the key differences between IMF/Western funding and China.",

Christoph Leitl, president of the Austrian Economic Chamber, led a 170-strong business delegation. The fields of science and culture were also represented. On this notable occasion, Federal Chancellor Kurz made a decided commitment to Austria\u2019s participation in the BRI. \u201cWe support the One Belt One Road initiative and are trying to forge a close economic cooperation. Austria has know-how and expertise to offer in many areas where China is looking for the same.\u201d Following, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed on Austria\u2019s cooperation in the New Silk Road or BRI project. Despite remaining reservations about the still strongly protectionist nature of the Chinese market, Austrian officials expect future business opportunities to open up for Austrian companies.\n\nIn other words, Austria and China are having the sort of normal diplomatic missions all countries have with each other but China is making everyone call that \"Belt and Road\". Austria has not become a member of diddly",

Western companies are typically much more risk adverse on this.\n* Similar/due to the above, many of these countries are economically desperate/shaky and will basically go for any lifeline or investment that doesn't involve opening up/transparency or dealing with the IMF which will have strings attached.\n\nBut obviously if western companies who are all about making money aren't doing these projects, that usually means that there are structural problems involved or the return is very risky or just downright poor.\n\nI can't speak for the merits of the projects: it may or may not be a good idea on the whole.

Corruption and economic and political instability all meant that you would likely never see any of your money returned. China decided to take the risk and now they have billions in loans that will likely never be repaid. Some countries just end up giving away all of their infrastructure when they can't pay - see Sri Lanka, Pakistan, swathes of Africa.\n\nDon't get me wrong its not all bad for China - they  usually require these projects use Chinese labour and Chinese companies which still leads to money flowing back to China. They also use it to for example install monitoring equipment in the headquarters for the African Union or to keep friendly rulers in place. As mentioned above they also often do an uno-reverso Hong Kong and lease ports and other infrastructure for 99 years if a country cant pay",

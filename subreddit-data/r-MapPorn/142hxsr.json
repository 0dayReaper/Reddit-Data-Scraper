This dam has seen fighting for years so it is not surprising it was damaged. Couple that with the fact that mantenence has been very limited because of the war and with an increase in water flow of the river in these last few days it is not impossible the dam just collapsed on it's own. Whichever case it truly is we will probably never know, and what really matters are the victims driven from their homes because of this tragedy.",

This  dam also is the main source of fresh water to Crimea. There is also the fact that while flooding the river might make a crossing more easilly seen the islands in the middle of the river were mostly swampy terrain perfect for defense, so the islands could help stall any crossing but now they will be mostly submerged making the path to the other side much faster (if also much more dangerous). So sure the timing might be suspicious but the fact is that the waterflow of the river was much stronger in these last few days, something neither side could manipulate.",

The public road which was constructed atop the dam was demolished months ago. \n\nNo one's security is perfect, especially Russia's, but we can certainly say access to this point of destruction was limited, which would have been a better term than access controlled.\n\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/06/world/europe/ukraine-kakhovka-dam-russia.html\n\n&gt;A blast in an enclosed space, with all of its energy applied against the structure around it, would do the most damage. Even then, the experts said, it would require hundreds of pounds of explosives, at least, to breach the dam. An external detonation by bomb or missile would exert only a fraction of its force against the dam, and would require an explosive many times larger to achieve a similar effect.\n\nSo people who blow up dams for a living report that the demolition would have required hundreds of pounds of explosives as an inside job by the Russians OR many times that quantity as an outside strike by Ukraine, or the separatists you suggest. \n\nI'll certainly concede nothing is impossible, and I've been impressed with Ukrainian special operations against Russian targets thus far: bridge, Kremlin, natural gas pipeline, however Delivering tons of explosives to the *outside* of the dam, or hundreds of pounds *inside* the Russian occupied dam seems a whole lot less likely than Russia recognizing that they're ill-prepared to defend a counter offensive and blow the dam. Occam's razor.\n\n\nPS I don't doubt that there are discontents - You call them separatists, they may call themselves partisans -- on both sides who might want to throw sand in the ointment for whoever the local occupiers are. I'm sure they do undertake actions which disrupt their opposition. Blowing up an enemy controlled dam (presumably with a military presence) seems like it might be beyond their capability",

Furthermore, I would fully expect the Russians to blow up the dam if it meant preventing a crossing, the Crimean canal be damned. Ultimately, the reason why I consider Russian sabotage somewhat more likely is because of the various problems and embarrassments that have happened relatively recently on the Russian side. While the Russian lines have nevertheless held in the east, I consider it quite possible that they may have been neglecting this front as a consequence. If this is so, than blowing up the dam would definitely buy them time.",

In addition, it is a colossal economic loss. But Ukraine benefits from the explosion of the dam - now it can move some troops to the East. It is easier for Ukraine to carry out sabotage by boat - as it has done many times before with Energodar. The Russians have only added problems and almost no advantages - so it is silly to think that this way disguises any shortcomings in the defense - the river is much more difficult to defend.",

Video of their boats being shelled can also be found. But now there is more and more information that Ukraine has increased the discharge of water to the hydroelectric power plant upriver, and the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power plant simply could not withstand the flow of water, as it had already been shelled by Ukraine many times before.",

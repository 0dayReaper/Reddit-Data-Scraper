Not saying this is good or bad.  There\u2019s many reasons for lack of public transportation. being a large country, and most importantly having a much lower population density than EU, is a big part of it. There\u2019s not enough demand to have this many trains going around the US.  Within major US cities the public transportation could be updated and used more to help eliminate traffic however.",

It was developed for humans, then razed to the ground thanks to the automotive industry and their lobbies, and then *re*built for cars.",

Alot (not all by any means) of Europeans seem to have this weird thing where their transit is so much better than the US's and any improvements to US transit is trash but at the same time act like any concerns or explanations in differences are \"excuses\" and/or are just totally dismissed. \n\nBut then in talking to some European transit supporters, I realized that alot of times nationlists/Europhiles use transit to show the superiority of Europe over the US and not as a way to advocate for for more/better transit in both the US and Europe. Thankfully the Europeans actually advocating for transit everywhere actually address concerns or issues rather than dismiss them as uninformed excuses but then again they are trying to help the US and therefore the world become better and not just \"win\" an imaginary contest / gloat about a reason for their superiority.",

The moment you leave those big cities with access to high-speed trains, you're in for a treat. \n\nTo give you an example: I have a second house in France. In the village is a train station. The next big city is about 45 km away, but by train it will take between 75 and 120 minutes. Why? Because the trainline my village is on, is not the same line as the trainline for the regional city I want to go to. So I take the train, towards the opposite direction, drive 30 km, then wait for the connecting train, enough time for more than a coffee and a croissant, and then travel back some 50 km. As the connection time is approx 40 min, this makes the jump to the car very appealing.\n\nSo, yes, you can travel from Rotterdam to Marseille in 8 hrs, but most of the times covering a short distance by train can be a frustrating experience.",

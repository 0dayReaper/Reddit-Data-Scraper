The numbers are purely from the Taiwan bilateral trade, it doesn't give an idea on how each country would rely on Taiwan more than other countries... As far as I understand what is displayed here, the \"reliance\" part sounds like a huge stretch to me.\n\nWhat I understand is: Germany is the biggest trade partner of Taiwan in Europe, with $20.7B of trade. That part just means that the other European countries trade less than $20.7B with Taiwan. Then the 40% means that 60% of this volume is German and 40% is Taiwanese.\n\nBut what if the other trading partners of Germany amount for a volume of (obviously random, excessive number) $59645347B? Those 40% of 20.7B would be like nothing and Germany would not be relying on Taiwan at all. So, what am I missing here?\n\n(I'm not criticizing the article you link, that one is much more on point for the reliance on Taiwanese trade)",

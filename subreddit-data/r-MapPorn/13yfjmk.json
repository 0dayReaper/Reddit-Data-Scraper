The island is called _\u00cele de la Cit\u00e9_ (City Island) in French.\n\nThe Romans settled the Left Bank (the area you can see here); there are several Roman remains to this day.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, this was where the University of Paris had its campus (today the Sorbonne). Since people came from all over Europe to study here, they spoke Latin in order to communicate with one another as Latin was the scholarly tongue at the time. That's why this is called the Latin Quarter.",

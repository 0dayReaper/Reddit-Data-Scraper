Arguably Blair got elected in part because Murdoch backed him. Our PMs were always at the mercy of right-wing media, not the other way round.\n\nThe BBC is only terrified because the government holds the rein to choke its funding, but nobody likes the BBC anymore since its cowardly non-stance appeals to neither left or rightwingers.\n\nThe newspapers and more TV channels are all private, what can the government do? The moment someone even thinks to rein in private media the media preemptively destroys them.",

A better characterization of the data might be to say news media in Portuguese is well regarded, while the news media in Spanish is poorly regarded.\n\nThis does make the divide in news trust between the UK and Ireland curious, given both populations are part of the same anglosphere. Do the Irish not listen to the BBC and instead listen to local Irish news they trust more than brits trust the BBC? Or do they just have a better impression of the BBC than brits themselves do?",

Instead, the right wing is acting like the Biden admin is Lenin incarnate. I knew in 2016 that things were getting ugly, but it's so much worse than I thought it would get. If Republicans retake the White House and Senate, there's a good chance they'll try to end American democracy as we know it. \n\nI want politics to become normal again, but right now I'm considering moving to a reliably blue state once I get my bachelor's degree.

It\u2019s one of the few independent ones and famous for having a part in revealing a lot of major political and corporate scandals in the past few years. Great daily investigative journalism. Behind a paywall tho.\n\nLe Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9 is a classic too. Only available in paper form on a weekly basis. Left leaning and independent. Satirical paper.\n\nFrance 24 is not independent, its boss is named by people named by the government. They won\u2019t criticize the government or the state of things too much. It\u2019s okay for basic daily news if you want to follow what\u2019s happening. RFI is the same. State financed medias are still mostly better than other private medias (bfm, lci or the worst major one C-news) but there has been stories of journalist/humorist being put aside for criticizing too much the government.",

And when did Fox become anti-Erdogan again? Mainstream media is completely in Erdogan's control, and the opposition candidate had ridiculous amounts of air time on these channels (like 1/100th of Erdogan or even less in most cases). The news are lying about the bad economy, the political instability of Turkey, the falsely accused opposition members/parties, the refugee crisis, the insane drop of wealth and quality of life within the last few years, basically everything. There is little to no opposition propaganda on mainstream media, and when you try to resist on social media, you get censored. Turkey has an authoritarian government which expects the people to serve them when actually they are supposed to do the serving. Overt corruption, illegal acts that violate the constitution, hostilizing and polarizing the public, years of exploitation of religion and many disgraceful events that have happened within these 21 years. And you want me to say \"nooo, the opposition are lying too\" because of a single provocative news channel who has little to no effect on the population compared to TRT, A haber, Star, TRT haber, Kanal D, TGRT haber, NTV, ATV, and many more.",

Gamers provide us with an excellent, relatively apolitical example: because \"hard games\" are seen as a marker of good taste, this leads people to describe easy games that they like as \"hard.\" Good games are hard games, and I like good games, and I like game x, therefore x is a hard game.\n\nI can't speak to most European cultures, but in the US, \"not trusting the news\" is a shorthand way of saying that you are a critical and discerning listener. It has little to do with *actually* trusting or mistrusting the news, and for reasons that I think are funny but are actually just math, the people most likely to *say* that are relatively plugged into the news. People who *really* don't trust the news...simply don't check the news at all, and if you talk to them about the most recent election or whatever they just go \"Wow that's crazy.

For all we know, 30-40% could be people answering N/A (or specifically \"Neither agree nor disagree\"; it could be that this data is available but I don't care to find it). The percentage only show those that \"strongly agree\" or \"agree\" with the statement that they \"can trust most news most of the time\". Overall, as you say, it is hard to believe these numbers, because they only show half the picture.",

You can't parade an encrypted communications system and the training needed to use on Victory Day down Red Square (nor would you want to because of signals intelligence issues). But a big result of how contracts have been filled under Putin (skim off however much you want as long as you meet the deliverables) is that stuff like communications systems were *assumed* to be fine, but now that they're being put to the test they're actually so horrible that it's better to use your cell phone. \n\nWeirdly it's not just corruption per se, because Ukraine has as deep corruption issues as Russia overall, just they've managed to (as far as we can tell so far) take these kinds of issues more seriously, although it helps that they've actually been getting daily combat experience since 2014, which everyone seems to forget.",

For this to happen, many people had to have dropped the ball here. But in other competent militaries, such as Israeli or USA, a lower level officer would have said something like \"Sir, I don't think using civilian cellphone networks alone and nakedly is a wise idea, that would create a vulnerability and thus give away plenty of information.\" And the general would be like \"Hm... That's a good point, I'll bring that up with the others and we'll find a solution.\" And then eventually they'll figure out and implement a solution so this doesn't happen, at least to a lesser degree/severity. But in Russia, they don't have that. So communication issues happen. Lower level officers aren't given discretion to adapt and seize opportunities that arise. So when things don't go to plan, they freeze. There is also issues of fear and getting canned/blamed, so people don't speak up. \n\nAlthough Russia actually had a communication system where special encrypted devices could be use to to piggyback/take advantage of the existing civilian infrastructure, but still be secure enough to use as a private communication. But they destroyed much of the underlying infrastructure.... so they can't use it.",

                    "comment": "I was recently reading a rather mediocre book about the lack of innovation in the US military from a few years ago.  The author used examples from the 2014-2016 phase of the war, where Russia absolutely dominated Ukraine, both on the physical and cyber warfare levels.  Ukrainian systems were hacked and the rapidity with which transmissions were homed in on by the Russians barely allowed them to communicate without giving away their positions.  The author gave one instance where Russian operatives called the mother of a Ukrainian officer to tell her that her son had been wounded.  She, of course, immediately called his personal cell phone.  He answered (seeing that it was from her), allowing his position to be targeted and wiped out.\n\n\nWhat changed?\n\n\n\nEDIT:  [The Book](https://www.rand.org/blog/2020/07/book-review-the-kill-chain-defending-america-in-the.html) (The Kill Chain, by Christian EDIT:  \"Brose\")  Basically musings from someone in the know, but not much there that anyone who wasn't already fairly up on national security matters wouldn't know.  What I'd hoped for was a greater level of detail and analysis than is generally available on message boards and general publications, but there was precious little in the way of facts and figures, comparisons to other militaries, or exploration of alternate causes for our issues.",

Which is rather ironic considering Russian history is a string of rulers with massive egos leading to the toppling of their governments. \n\nOne of my favorite Russian examples of this is the Russo-Japan war. Czar Nicholas wanted to boost nationalism with a successful war campaign and decided to invade Manchuria. The Japanese were also invading Manchuria and offered the Russians a deal to just split the conquest and share a border. Nicholas decided this wasn\u2019t acceptable and started a war where the Japanese kicked the absolute shit out of the Russians. This in turn weakened the Czars position and was one of the many factors that lead to the Bolshevik revolution.",

            "comment": "Though Alabama is almost 30% black, it only has one black-majority Congressional district, AL-7, which packs black voters in the rural western Black Belt with the cities of Birmingham, Tuscaloosa, and Montgomery. The remainder of the Black Belt is split apart into multiple white-majority districts. \n\nOpponents of the map successfully argued that Alabama could draw a second black-majority district, and that their refusal to do so constitited a violation of the Voting Rights Act. Had Alabama succeeded, it is possible that the VRA's requirement for the creation of majority-minority districts could have been totally ruled unconstitutional. However, opponents won, and Alabama - likely along with fellow Southern states Louisiana and South Carolina - will be forced to redraw new districts, adding an additional black-majority district.",

If you tell them to \"divide them up by cities and the surrounding area\", they will do so in a way that still removes minority representation, and this is exactly what they did again and again in Jim Crow. The only way that worked was a results-oriented approach in which the law explicitly counters this by saying you must have districts where minority voters can have some representation.",

The distribution of party voters (partisan gerrymandering) and minority voters (racial gerrymandering). Geography is a nice thing to have, but it doesn't overcome federal law in the form of the Voting Rights Act that says you can't racially gerrymander.",

Imagine in our current system that a party gets 55% in every district. They end up with 100% of the representatives. In the German system they'd get 82.5% of the reps.

You still have single member districts but the overall legislative makeup must reflect the statewide party preference vote. You can either award the at-large seats by party lists or by seating the closest runners-up from the various districts. This also lets 3rd parties become viable by seating a few at-large as long as they hit a minimum threshold, even if they are not concentrated enough to win any districts. \n\nIf we used MMPR in Congressional elections, Dems would have about 2 more seats than they do now.

It has 4 guaranteed seats for each of the two major parties on a 13 seat counsel. The other 5 are then randomly selected from a pool of apolitical option this is enforced because neither party wants the opposition to get one of these 5 seats, so it's somewhat self-regulating as both parties fight eachother over the \"fairness\" of the apolitical 5 seats. Eventually when the commission starts its redistricting it means that both party's and the 5 seats have to agree on the new proposals. \n\nSure the seats can be influenced, but both sides basically hurt eachothers ability to make egregious maps by having the garenteed seats and independents to fight over. It's not perfect, but it makes for a lot more fair districts.",

Half the seats are assigned based on popular vote in individual districts, half by party-vote across the entire area such that the total most closely represents the actual popular vote. This preserves each district getting a single dedicated representative while making third parties viable nationwide *and* making gerrymandering largely pointless.\n\nSo in the case of Alabama there are currently 7 seats. Imagine this as the entire chamber, doubled to 14 to work with this system. 7 seats go the same as in the current election. 6 republicans and 1 democrat.\n\nThe other seven are split to make the final composition match the popular vote (which was 70% republican, 23% democrat, 6% libertarian). Meaning the respective parties appoint 4 republicans, 2 democrats, and 1 libertarian. And the final composition is 10 republicans (71% for 70% popular vote, compared to 85% in the current system), 3 democrats (21% for 24% popular, compared to 14% in the current system), and 1 libertarian (7% for 6% popular, compared to 0% in the current system).\n\nIt's not a perfect system, but at least to me it feels much less vulnerable to abuse than the current system or any other I've heard proposed.",

It was intended for voters to feel close to their representatives. In practice, however, due to a cap on the House of Representatives, the size of districts has grown tremendously, and egregious gerrymandering has linked together communities with very different interests. \n\nEach district has roughly the same population, but this is about the only requirement. Some states have more restrictions (Iowa requires counties to not be split, Ohio requires Cincinnati and Cleveland to not be split), and civil rights legislation like the VRA are intended to guarantee minorities have representation via majority-minority districts. Beyond that, legislators theoretically have free reign to draw whatever they want. Several states have implemented independent, non-partisan redistricting commissions, but in most whichever party controls the state government controls the maps. \n\nIt's not a very effective system and even with independent redistricting I'm of the opinion that some form of proportional representation is needed to fix it, but that's roughly how it works.",

If someone has a strong opinion on a particular bill they may try to contact their representative to encourage them to vote one way or the other on it, and they could keep track of how that representative votes to help choose whether to reelect them. Ideally the representative will build a relationship with the community there.\n\nThis does not work as well as intended when you introduce gerrymandering and weirdly shaped districts. One reason is because you have these districts that don't make much sense geographically and snake all over the place, making it harder for the representative to feel tied to the area. Another is that gerrymandered districts often create safe seats where one party is nearly guaranteed to win, so representatives there feel less of a need to listen to constituents who identify with the other party.",

This is similar to the UK or Canada with the exception being that the party leadership does not decide who runs where. (Also some states like CA or WA have jungle primary so only the top two winners advance to the general election).\n\nThere are 435 districts and after each census, states who have gained enough seats will gain a district and those who have not grown as fast or lost population will lose a seat. Note that CA as of the census had not lost population yet but didn't gain enough to keep one of their seats.\n\nIn many states, the legislature writes the districts. Usually this favors the party in power but if the other party controls one branch of state government such as the state Senate, house, governorship, or state courts they can check the other party's power. In states like California formerly, the GOP was okay with the Dems being in control as long as their own seats were gerrymandered for incumbents of both parties. \nNow CA, AZ and other states have a commission that is chosen every ten years and they choose the districts based on certain criteria. Arizona favors political balance, CA favors communities of interest while balancing civil rights legislation and so forth without regards to incumbents. This is a much better system.\n\nPlaces like NY drew a map that heavily favored Dems and was rejected in state court . The maps had to be redrawn Because they got greedy, that was a huge factor in the GOP winning the house. Otherwise Hakim Jefferies would have been speaker and the drama of the last month or of January's speaker crisis would have been avoided.\n\nIn Texas, the Dems had high hopes in 2020 after the census but failed to control one of the branches so as a result the Texas legislature redrew the maps to be more favorable to the GOP which makes it most difficult for Dems to win a majority of state or federal races for a few years. Eventually it evens out if there was no redistricting due to moves and deaths but before that a new census is done.\n\nGerrymandering has two strategies. Maximize your party's gains by stretching the map thin and risk the other party winning in a wave election or be conservative and pack their voters in one or two districts and have you win fewer district's in less competitive elections. \nGenerally the fewer close elections there are in a district, the more likely you'll have conservative Republicans such as a the Freedom Caucus primary establishment types and vice versa for liberal Democrats but you don't see the latter as much.",

Republicans would safely win every district and every district was majority-white. It didn't happen that way because I hate black people. I've never been to Alabama and I don't even know who lives where. It's just a result of the fact the statewide majority is most likely going to be the majority in every district unless you make a concentrated effort to avoid it.\n\nFor a map that is properly \"balanced\" you essentially *need* to Gerrymander it. Republicans didn't need to create a weird-looking map to give themselves an advantage. They needed to create a weird-looking map because they knew they needed to create at least one black-majority district for the map to be accepted. So they did that. But then it was ruled that that one district wasn't sufficient, so the map will need to be tweaked more.",

But in general, you want to strive for non-partisan redistricting that keeps together communities with common interests in reasonably compact districts. This is still limited by geography, but you can't fix that without abandoning districts entirely and going for proportional representation.",

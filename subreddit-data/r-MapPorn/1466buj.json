The Soviets had merely demanded Austria become non-aligned (like Finland).\n\nModern-day Austria is a curious case. They're very isolationist and now very right-leaning. They're the EU member state where the union is the least popular. And they downright loathe NATO. Polls show that a relative majority of the Austrians find Russia to be more trustworthy than NATO.\n\nIf you care for my opinion: I'd say that unlike the Germans or the Japanese, the Austrians never completely overcame their grudge over losing their empire.",

The EU does have a mutual defense clause, Article 42(7). Austria is obligated to \u201caid\u201d other member nations if they\u2019re attacked. But that aid is allowed to be tempered by national defense policy (including policies of neutrality) and isn\u2019t required to be *military* aid. \n\nIt\u2019s a super weak mutual defense pact. If New Zealand were to invade Zealand (original flavor) Austria would be required to act. But Austria could chose to act solely politically, or through sanctions, or via giving Denmark humanitarian supplies (food and bandages only). They aren\u2019t required to send a single soldier or bullet.",

Coercion really undermines that (and is what caused a lot of internal Warsaw Pact drama).  It was also probably a lot more viable when NATO involved a much smaller number of more like-minded nations with a very obvious common enemy.",

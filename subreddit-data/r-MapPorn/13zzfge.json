Especially through the first 50 years it was run for the benefit of the business class. The same voting laws that suppressed the Catholic vote (only one vote per household, multiple votes for business owners based on the size of their business) also suppressed the poor Protestant vote, but since Catholics were systematically excluded from most economic life, it suppressed more of their vote. Poor Protestants were given a little bit extra like most factories being situated in Protestant areas, and the feeling that no matter how badly off they were, at least there was someone else worse off. \n\nThe NILP was a pro-UK, pro-Labour party that had large support in working class areas among both Protestants and Catholics, and was the major opposition party to the Unionists in Stormont. But their vote collapsed among Catholics when they expelled members who tried to get the NILP involved in supporting the Civil Rights Movement (which would have also helped poor Protestants)\n\nThat\u2019s history now, but every single time working class Protestants have voted against their own best interests.",

Also in reaponse to your edit about the scots-Irish, I was referring to your first comment, the Scots-Irish in America are one thing, and the Ulster-scots here are another. They are groups that seperated centuries ago with little further contact, and are therefore distinct culturally. what I meant was not to refer to people here as Scots-Irish, to us that specifically refers to ulster scots descendants living in appalachia.",

Oh that\u2019s right, the British did, for a good 150 years before we even became a nation. And also tell me how the British only emancipated slaves just 30 years before Americans did so, and how they kept their colonies full of Africans in dire poverty to labor in sugarcane, cacao, and tobacco plantations by armed force. Are you going to tell that story, or is it just Americans you hate for no reason? I love the sheer arrogance and hubris of people who lecture Americans on their wrongdoings as if it minimizes their own crimes against humanity, and this includes the many Irish who, when a part of the British Empire, gleefully joined the British armed forces to circle the globe oppressing people of all colors and generally causing havoc, the residual effects of which persist to this day.",

There\u2019s a marked distinction between that and voluntary emigration. Mine is simply a conjecture of what *could* be, not what I think it *would* be. Ideals are not uniform, they are individual. The idea that a people cannot at least strive to live in a strife-free society is frankly Neanderthalic.",

Obviously people can strive to live in a strife-free society, but that's not what you've done here in the slightest.  \n\n\nLines like this \"**Cut their losses in 1921 and** ***forced the entire island*** **to unite, for better or worse***\" followed* by nonsense like this \"**Half of the Scots-Irish would have emigrated back to England**\" and acting as if Ireland would be strife free as long as an entire cultural demographic and majority of the populace would just dissapear.  \n\n\nIt's so ignorant on the base of it, that most people just angrily downvote you and move on, but to pretty much ***everyone*** else, they just see that deeply ignorant viewpoint for what it is, a clueless American who has no idea, talking out their backside then getting defensive when it's pointed out.  \n\n\nYour viewpoint is uniquely American, because nobody from Ireland is that stupid, even the nationalists, it's like a viewpoint of Ireland that entirely ignores everything that happened ***after*** 1921.  \n\n\n  \nI mean, but sure, I didn't realize the fix to the troubles was in front of us all along, wouldn't have been any need for sectarian bloodshed if everybody who was not a nationalist dissapeared back to England (Ignoring that the majority of them are born in NI like, but fuck it, just ship em over there right?).\n\n  \nIf you're going to call people neanderthalic, at least have the temerity to know what you're on about and pick up a book on the troubles while you're at it.",

It\u2019s a ***conjecture***, not facts that I\u2019m stating, and I\u2019m not really sure why you\u2019re confusing those two things here. You expose yourself as someone without much intellect or the ability for abstract thought, as well as being a shallow, confidently-incorrect clown who clearly has anger issues of some kind that you like to take out on strangers on the internet. Now, I\u2019ve answered another one of your dopey comments on why I think Protestants would have emigrated (not deported, not expelled, but voluntarily left) had the British abandoned *all* of Ireland **in 1921**. It\u2019s not a \u201cfantasy\u201d either, it\u2019s based on the actual movements of emigrants from other nations in the 20th Century faced with similar situations, (Zimbabwe, South Africa, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union come immediately to mind). People throughout history have migrated when confronted with new realities, and Ireland is in fact a very noticeable example at other points in history. (While you\u2019re flinging books about the Troubles against the wall in rage, you might want to pick up a book on the Scots-Irish in Appalachia and maybe educate yourself about one aspect of the emigrant experience). In my ***conjecture*** for 1921 - again, not actual, but *possible* - the entire history of Ireland thenceforth would have been altered, and the ethnic conflicts including the Troubles of the 1960s-90s either *might not* have happened, or at least would have taken some other form of civil rights protests since the struggle was based on British occupation of Northern Ireland and its detrimental effects on a large portion of the people being ruled. If the British depart in 1921, however, according to my *conjecture* it removes an important dynamic in that struggle. Now, if you want to argue what *might* have happened had the British left, if the north of Ireland would or would not stabilize and be more peaceful for the rest of the century, that\u2019s something fun to discuss. But it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re very open to offering anything more than hysterical reaction mixed with blind arrogance.",

So the that 6 counties allowed us, but any of the other 3 would\u2019ve been too many Catholics basically. The counties of Tyrone and Fermanagh being included in NI was basically a gerrymander.",

There's really no reason unionists should keep any power over the more native population when there numbers are so close and segregation so prevalent in the territory.  Again, this is in Ireland's case, without referencing some other part of the globe's similar history of conflict between an introduced population and the population that was already living there.",

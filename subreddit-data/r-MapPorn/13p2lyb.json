                    "comment": "This is my biased and somewhat cynic summary:\n\nNew Democracy is a large centre-right force. It includes progressive right-liberal elements as well as hardcore conservatives and traditionalists. It has been in power since 2019 when it won by a margin. It was in power during the covid pandemic, and the large 2020 fires. It was involved in a few scandals (including using the intelligence service to spy on the leader of PASOk) and has been criticised for its sometime authoritarian behaviour but as the election results showed Greeks really trust it yo be the best option.\n\nSYRIZA is the coalition of radical left. A previously obscure far-left party that arose out of the forced political restructuring brought about by the Greek sovereign debt crisis. It was the opposition from 2012 to 2015 and in government from 2015 to 2019. It's rhetoric is reactionary and populist and involved ideas like \"stick the middle finger to Europe\" and \"we will tear apart the  memoranda of understanding\". It has been criticised very heavily for completely mishandling the crisis, attempting to get better terms for Greece by making empty threats to our Eurozone creditors that resulted in the imposition of capital controls and unmanageable interest rates for our bond  and also for signing an incredibly unpopular agreement with our Northern Neighbour, over the Macedonian name dispute. It has also been criticised over it's handling of the migrant crisis and its very hands-off approach to dealing with crime.\n\nPASOK (Panhellenic Socialist Party) is a centre-left party that has been at the heart of Greek politics since the 1980s. It is seen as largely responsible for the imprudent fiscal administration of Greece that led to the sovereign debt crisis which involved appropriation of EU funds for non-productive investments, the over-expansion of the public sector and generally overtly clientelistic politics. It was brought down in 2012 when Greece was forced into very harsh structural reforms by the EU and IMF. It has managed to recover some of the ground lost to SYRIZA in recent times due to the latter's reactionary flair slowly fading but still remains tainted by its responsibility for the crisis.\n\nKKE is the communist party of Greece. There isn't much else to say here. It is a traditionalist Stalinist party that has not changed its positions in around 50 years. It believes that it will take power through class struggle when the time is ripe for revolution and only participates in the \"institutions of bourgeois democracy\" to cultivate the revolutionary spirit for the advance of global socialism. They are completely out of touch with reality.\n\nElliniki Lisi (Greek Solution) is a right-wing to far-right party that emerged as a parliamentary force in the 2019 elections following the dismantling of the neonazi Golden Dawn party and the arrests of its leadership. Elliniki Lisi is much more mild and has attempted to incorporate some economically liberal positions to its programme to attract non-nationalists. Nonetheless it is very conservative in it's core, it's against lgbt rights, against immigration, against vaccines, and often invokes Orthodox Christian rhetoric. The leader is known for selling (obviously forged) manuscripts of Jesus Christ himself on TV. \n\nHope all this helps.",

The results are expected to mirror the ones we got now but New Democracy will get a few bonus seats in parliament allowing them to rule with an outright parliamentary majority. \n\nIn terms of policy, we can expect further positive steps towards the digitalisation of bureaucracy (actually eliminating bureaucracy is too much to ask for so at least now we can do it without wasting paper), there is talk to finally allow private tertiary education institutions opening up, and hopefully there will be an upgrade to our rail network, but maybe I'm too optimistic. We can also expect higher taxes to somehow pay for the huge fiscal cost of the pandemic which left Greece with a debt-to-GDP ratio of around 200%. New Democracy has also set a very dangerous presidence when it comes to the independence of the judicial system (messing with its structure and composition to pass clearly unconstitutional laws) and we can expect that to continue.\n\nIn terms of the long-term structural reforms and institution-building that are necessary to finally transform Greece into a proper European economy, they are unlikely to take place. Justice will remain painstakingly slow and investors will continue needing political connections to actually build anything in Greece. Corporate taxation will remain high making business difficult, and the minimum wage will be raised further (without any econometric consideration as to wether this is sustainable) keeping Greek competitiveness down. The public sector will also remain bloated, badly managed, and effectively controlled by unions that demand no evaluation of their members ever takes place. The long-term growth potential of the country will remain low and certainly not the one you'd expect from a catching-up economy.\n\nI am not saying all this just to shit on New Democracy, things would have stayed the same regardless of the electoral outcome. Actually fixing the issues that plague Greece requires huge political will and a deep ideological commitment to positive change. These are things you seldom find in career politicians.",

I believe both are pragmatic enough to want to avoid having EL in the government. By the way, we don't have a two-round system. Our normal election system is a proportional system with bonus Parliament seats for the winning party. After the elections, the first three parties in order of results take the order to form a government. There are three options: they succeed on their own, they agree on a coalition or they return their order to form a government, so it's given to the next party. They have 3 days for that (ND returned it immediately by the way). If all three fail (which is forced to happen in this election), a temporary government is formed with the responsibility to break up the Parliament and start the election process again. Rinse and repeat until there is a result. For example, in 1989-1990 it took 3 elections for them to form a government.\n\nHowever, due to an idea SYRIZA had in 2016, they threw out that law and replaced it with a simple proportional system that simply cannot create a government. However, due to the way the election legislation works, the law skipped an election before being applied, so it was applied in this election for the first time. But ND got rid of that new law and returned to a system with a bonus (a smaller one this time though; I actually like the new law better than both alternatives, as it is a combination of fair and practical), which again had to skip an election and will be enforced in the next election (probably in 25 June), so ND is getting a majority. Oh, also, any party that doesn't gather at least 3% of the votes doesn't get in the Parliament (this stayed unchanged).",

So a modern political party that seeks to remove the rights of sexual/religious minorities or certain political movements can quite easily, and for the sake of ease, be considered *fascist*.",

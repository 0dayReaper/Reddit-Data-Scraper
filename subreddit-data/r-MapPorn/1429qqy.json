They have a motive. And they ruled that said motive was more important than any incentive of not to do so. The counteroffensive.\n\nMy friend, you're talking of an army whose military doctrine is:\n\nA: Quick Assault to overrun the enemy.\n\nB: If option A is a failure, bombard every single building in the vicinity (look at Bakmut as an example).\n\nC: If option B is a failure, repeat it again.\n\nThey have already willingness to destroy vital infrastructures to obtain gains in the battlefield (which could make sense strategically, but not for the short gains in a months long theatre of war).\n\n&gt;Hell, one of the big reasons they pulled out of Kherson months ago was because they were afraid of Ukraine doing precisely this and trapping their troops on the wrong side of the river and messing up their defenses.\n\nAnd Ukraine used Himars to accurately destroy the bridges, not the dam. Ukraine destroyed the parts that would make any crossing impossible and not the functionality/integrity of the dam.\n\n&gt;Meanwhile Ukraine and NATO has already openly discussed plans to do precisely this in western media outlets\n\nThat's right, key word \"DISCUSSED\". Means they viewed this option. That's what you do in wars, you analyze every option you can do. Then discard those that bring more harm than good.\n\n&gt;and has already committed similar attacks like on the Crimean Bridge and Nordstream.\n\nIf you honestly believe NATO had any part on that, then damn how naive you are.\n\nIn the Crimean Bridge, NATO was still concerned that Crimea was a \"red line\" for Russia (it turn out it wasn't, nor should be). Almost certain Ukranian saboteurs did it.\n\nWhile it is unfortunate that 3 Russian civilians died, the bridge was a legitimate target (as it was resupplying Russian forces).\n\nIn the Nordstream.... \n\nOne: Denmark released a photo of a Russian ship in the proximity of where the explosions happened. \n\nTwo: the journalist that said that the \"US\" (not NATO, i know the US is the heavyweighter but it ain't the sole member of the organization) blow up the Nordstream has several inconsistencies in his story.\n\n&gt;the idea they'd blow their own dam is far-fetched.\n\nOne: is not entirely far fetched.\n\nTwo: is NOT their dam.",

The NPP will be stopped, if it cannot be cooled by the decreasing water from the reservoir, and most of towns controlled by the Russians will be de-energized. From a military point, flooding of the riverbed does not matter, because the main directions of the offensive are expected in other places. But now the evacuation of the population and material assets is required. The roads will be overloaded with civilian transport, which creates serious obstacles for the Russian force in the event of the counteroffensive, and it is expected in the near future. In my opinion, the benefits for the Ukrainian force are obvious.",

Raids, such as in the Belgorod region, are an American army tactic. Considering that Ukraine itself is building fortifications on the right side of the Dnieper, this indicates that they want to remove some of the military from the Kherson region and redeploy them to the East. The flooding of the river will not allow Russia to retake Kherson quickly. In addition, it destroys the ecology and economy of the region that Russia considers its own, which means additional costs for Russia. For Ukraine, which exists on Western loans and which will actually be sold off - in case of victory - it is the liberation of the territory from the people and the Soviet past.",

For Russia, this disaster is exactly unnecessary and since it coincides with the fierce attacks of the Ukrainians, it is definitely part of the offensive.\r  \n\r  \nAccording to this map, Russia did not fully control the hydroelectric plant and Ukrainian saboteurs had the opportunity to destroy the dam.\r  \n\r  \nhttps://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/36a7f6a6f5a9448496de641cf64bd375",

Therefore, both Russians and Ukrainians had access to the dam and could plant the explosions.\n\n\n2) The destruction of that dam causes way more harm to the Russian side than to the Ukrainian one, because of the geography of that area. We can see that on the provided image. Left bank is lower than the right bank, so the flooding would be more severe on the Russian side, forcing them to regroup further inland and evacuate citizens, which can give Ukraine an advantage to swiftly cross the river while Russian artillery is moving away, and take some territories, like Kinburn Spit, which would deblockade Ukrainian port of Ochakov and also create a foothold for further counteroffensive. \n\n\n3) The destruction of the dam causes the water level upstream to lower, which:\n\nA) Makes it easier to cross for counterattack somewhere around nuclear plant in Energodar, which is controlled by Russia;\n\nB) Puts said nuclear plant in danger, because it needs a lot of water to function properly;\n\nC) Lowers the amount of water that goes to canal that provides Crimea with said water, which also damages Russian operations in the region.\n\n\n4) Ukraine was considering the destruction of that dam and shelled it in the past, back when it was still under full control of Russia, you can find the link to Washington Post article here in the comments.\n\n5) Some sources claim that Ukraine started dumping water from Dniepr Hydroelectric Station, which is upstream and fully under control of Ukraine, to flood the area even more.\n\nAll these facts lead to believe that it is far more beneficial to Ukraine to blow this dam up to cripple Russia's powers in the region, while it gives absolutely no advantages to Russia.",

And while it is true that local authorities report that everything is under control for now, the situation can change in the future, if the other dam upstream won't release enough water.\n\nSame goes for Crimea. While reservoirs are full for now, fixing the dam is not something that would be done before the war ends, and there could be problems in the future, like when before the war, when Ukraine blocked the canal\n\nWhile the destruction of the dam indeed makes the river wider, it also washes down all the mines that were planted on the banks, which can be beneficial for small motorboats, that they already used before in similar operations",

There'll be enough water for necessities but in the long term agriculture will become difficult.",

They were terrified of western powers screwing with Tibet or Soviets supporting an uprising in Xinjiang. Minorities in China are only about 10% of the population, and most of them live in rural areas far from the overcrowded core that China was really concerned about. Plus there has always been the assumption that minorities will inevitably assimilate to their culture. So it is the party\u2019s opinion all of those Tibetans, Uyghurs, Mongolians, etc will become Chinese eventually anyway. \n\nOf course nowadays China is not so afraid of foreign powers, and the policy has reversed so Han Chinese are being encouraged to have more children while Uyghurs especially are being sterilized.",

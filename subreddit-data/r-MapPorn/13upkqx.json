Please note that it is only a problem when a great deal of people do this, however a great many do in fact do this.\n\n1. Decreased domestic demand: When people spend money in foreign countries, they are not spending it in their own country. This can lead to a decrease in domestic demand for goods and services, which can hurt the economy.\n\n2. Increased imports: buying goods and services in turkey hurts german producers who are competing with foreign producers. This wouldnt be such a big problem if it wasnt done by so many people(not all or only turkish people im just giving you examples)\n\n3. Many 1st-generation germans abuse the welfare system in germany: I know an abundance of people personally in germany that live off of german welfare but mostly go \u201chome\u201d for the summer and spend said government money in those countries, predominantly because they get more bang for their buck.\n\n4. Decreased tax revenue: When people spend money in foreign countries, it can lead to a decrease in tax revenue for their own country. This is because businesses may move their operations to countries with lower tax rates, or because people may buy goods and services that are not subject to domestic taxes.",

They martyred themselves during the refugee crisis as the \"anti-Trump\" and \"anti-Brexit\" and now most Germans, Swiss, Danes, Dutch, etc., I've heard talk about the matter sound like they are getting their talking points from the more extreme sides of Fox and Sky News. Granted, I think there was a fundamental misunderstanding by many Europeans of most English speaking countries views of migration due to most people in Europe only hearing the extreme sides on social and traditional media. But the problem lies in acting holier than thou and then complaining that everyone else is at fault when problems come up. It shouldn't be expected that non-settler nation-states act like settler countries (Canada, New Zealand, etc.) that do a much better job of integrating migrants. Central and northern Europeans have a much more rigid sense of what constitutes being (fill in the blank with nationality) than settler countries do, and that is OK, but means that integration is going to be tougher.\n\n I think now unfortunately alot of Germans, Danes, Swiss, Dutch, Swedes,  (as well as migrants TBH) are paying for the hubris of their politicians who wanted to get quick political \"points\" by martrying themselves on how great they are and how different their countries are compared to the evil UK and US when in reality most of the people(both left,center, right wing) in central/northern Europe have views on this topic similar to right wingers in the US and UK. \n\nTLDR - Politicians from northern and central Europe martryed themselves as being super open and migrant friendly during the Trump and Brexit years for political points and now are blaming everyone else when problems arise.",

And as result it tends to be mutually exclusive with the above (albeit not always).\n\nThe inverse of course being in the US where there are rather large populations of relatively poor Islamic Arab and South Asia communities that are still relatively religious, but at the same time are super about participating in American culture  and integrating both culturally and economically. But I attribute this to the rather unique and somewhat ironic combination of simultaneously being more hostile to open displays of non-Western culture while also being more inclusive and accepting of non-Westerners joining the broader American cultural understanding than most of Western Europe - which is somewhat understandable as despite what a lot of people say (and want), we are not an ethnostate.",

Then you go on and vote for a right-wing nationalist who often uses your host country as a scapegoat. How do you think the locals feel?\n\nThat's exactly the case with many Turkish in Germany. Preaching tolerance / acceptance towards \"racist\" Germans and at the same time voting for right-wing intolerant nutjobs. These kind of people most definitely don't belong here. If you love your country that much and apparently hate ours, go home.",

This because of jealousy and a feeling of not beloning.\n\nIts a hard thing to handle. The easy answer is getting them out of their bubble and more importantly improving education, but thats not as easy as it sounds. Considering in WE most are from originally mining families and now labourers that are uninterested in higher education. Even though the barrier of entry is very low (it might be hard but its actually quite cheap).",

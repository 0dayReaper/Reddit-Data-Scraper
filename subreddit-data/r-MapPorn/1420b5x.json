In *South Australia*, women could not only vote but be elected to Parliament in 1894, so it wasn't just women having to vote for men. That *may* be a first.  This did not include Aboriginal women (or men) for a variety of reasons, chief among which were undoubtedly colonial attitudes to native people and racism.  Australia wasn't federated until 1901.",

Someone who supports a lower voting age for a country could argue that women today haven't been extended the right to vote by that logic. And, by taking a blanket impediment to voting access and applying it to just women, it falsely creates the impression that men had superior rights in cases which they did not.\n\nI would say that it is fair comment that true universal franchise did not come to Canada until 1960, but gender was not the criteria for disenfranchisement. I would also couch arguments saying Canada was without universal suffrage in proportionality too. Some 220K people reported aboriginal ancestry in 1961 out of a total population of 18M.\n\n220K/18M = 1.22%\n\nAnd, this would be the upper bound, since the voting impediment only applied to status Indians and this data doesn't differentiate Inuit, who could vote in 1950 (not without certain controversies around access to polls), M\u00e9tis who could always vote, \"enfranchised\" (any person or group who opted out of Indian Status and certain professions also like doctors automatically conferred enfranchisement),  people reporting a partial ancestry or minors.\n\nI'm not saying the issue wasn't existential for those involved. But the move from somewhere in the ballpark of 99% suffrage to 100% suffrage isn't quite as dramatic as the shift from ~50% to ~99%.",

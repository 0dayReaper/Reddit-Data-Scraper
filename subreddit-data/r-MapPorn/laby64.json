We can tell where continents were but not how they interact specifically unless minerals tell us explicitly that a continental collision happened for instance. There are a few places like Gabon and South Africa where you have relatively unmetamorphosed sedimentary rock records which show some remarkable events such as the Francevillian biota(first complex macroscopic fossils of a biological origin ~2.1 Ga disapear from fossil record as oxygen levels crash but fossils include interesting finds liek some sort of cellular slime mold analog that was burrowing through sediment. Note  that these were likely not Eukaryotes as we know them which share a last common ancestor LECA at ~1.8 Ga) Vredefort Impact 2,023 \u00b1 4 Ma targeting a bay and delta interface region). There is Oklo a natural nuclear reactor  from 1.7 Ga.  It is a series of brief localized windows in time but it shows there was a lot going on that has been lost and or erased. We generally don't see the complexity of unicellular life as the fossil record doesn't sustain that but phylogenetic dating suggests a lot was going on there with microbes taking/trading genetics material and waging war against viruses. One interesting line of research I have read suggests modern Cyanobacteria only acquired photosynthetic machinery after the Great Oxygenation Event suggesting it was some now extinct linage of microbes responsible for that innovation which was later taken by cyanobacteria which if true hints really the true diversity of ancient history.",

For recent stuff (maybe the last 100 million years in some places) we can look at where the plates are heading now and just extrapolate backwards. But plate tectonics is messy, so there's some stuff more recent than that which has been completely obliterated.\n\nPaleomagnetism is one way to do this. Many volcanic rocks record the magnetic field they were exposed to when they cooled, so you can figure out their original compass orientation and by extension the orientation of the continent they were formed on. This gets complicated because rocks can be overturned and the magnetic poles themselves flip every so often, but with enough samples and study of the rocks you can find out a lot. \n\nYou can also look at fossils from different parts of the world. If a certain animal is only found on one continent and suddenly becomes common on another, it's possible there was a collision between the continents that allowed the species to expand. If a once widespread species starts to diverge into two separate groups, two continents may have split apart. Pangaea provides many examples of these processes occuring as it formed and broke up. \n\nRock types provide another clue. Similar rocks are found in europe and the americas from before they started drifting apart. The Scottish highlands and the Appalachians share a common history but split as the Atlantic opened up. The reason the mountain range exists in the first place is because of several earlier periods of continental collision.\n\nIt's also worth noting that there are parts of earth's surface that are billions of years old. The first continents were likely smaller than current ones, and through billions of years of tectonics they have become harder and thicker than newer sections of the continents that were accreted on. They are resistant to subduction, too thick to completely erode, and don't form rifts as easily. This preserves some very old rocks, some of which are in surprisingly good condition. \n\nEven with all of these tools there's definitely an element of guesswork, especially for the oldest continents and supercontinents where much less evidence has been preserved. But hopefully you can see how geologists and paleontologists can assembled a host of evidence sources to tease out the most likely possibilities.",

Lots of rocks from a billion+ years ago are pretty messed up and so haven't kept their original orientation and magnetic qualities so you have to look at where ancient mountain ranges are or whatever. You're definitely right that this map has guesses, but you'd be surprised what you can dig up when you're really meticulous about considering every scrap of knowledge. People spend years collecting rocks and examining them in the lab, it's crazy. \n\nWe can definitely estimate the future motions by projecting current movements forward! There are a number of maps out there of predictions and a couple people have posted them elsewhere in the thread. But since it hasn't happened yet we don't have the advantage of looking at evidence in the rocks. It's pretty likely another supercontinent will form in the future because it has happened multiple times in the past. Also plate tectonics is slowing down a bit as the planet cools but the rate of change is pretty slow.",

The crust is brittle like glass. The mantle is solid but flows over time like silly putty. The outer core is liquid because it's so hot. The inner core is even hotter but is squeezed so hard that it's solid. \n\nSo there are two main things that keep plates moving. The main one is mantle convection. Convection happens because hot stuff is usually less dense than cold stuff, so it rises like a hot air balloon and then sinks back down once it releases the heat at the surface of the earth. About half of the heat comes from radioactive materials in the crust and mantle, and about half comes from leftover heat from when the earth was forming. As the mantle material cycles around in loops called convection cells, it pulls the crust along the surface of the earth like a boat floating on a river. The convection cells change over time so sometimes the direction changes.\n\nThe other important force is slab pull. At ocean subduction zones the less dense continental crust rides up on top of the oceanic crust. The oceanic crust is dense and cool enough that it can keep sinking, pulling the rest of the oceanic crust like a tablecloth falling off the side of the table. \n\nSide note: most of the mantle is solid, so melting only happens where something interesting is happening. Addition of water and release of pressure are large-scale generators of melt in subduction zones and mid ocean ridges respectively, but they're side-effects of the plate movement.",

That's quite a coincidence.  The effects would include not only the immediate fireball, deorbiting debris, and megatsunami that would promptly roast or otherwise kill things over a decent part of the western hemisphere, but it was also impacting into limestone and gypsum that would evaporate into CO2 and SO2 in the atmosphere.  Finer dust and aerosols would be suspended for months to years.  It would have global effects including cold temperatures due to partial blocking of the sun.  For comparison, look up the 1815 volcanic eruption of Tambora, the \"year without a summer\".  The effects from Chicxulub would be far worse.\n\nWhile the Deccan Traps might be a factor because they straddle the age of the boundary too, they start erupting well before and continue until some time after.  They may have primed the system, and then the impact created a truly bad day, followed by months or years of bad conditions.",

So it makes sense that it grows over time imo, but I only got a bachelor's and if muskox researched this I'm sure he knows more. I learned that there is great uncertainty on the first continents but it always seemed to me that the reason we have more continents now than before was pretty straight forward",

That's an important point that I should have included in my earlier comment. You actually can actually get subduction of continental crust in continent-continent collisions, as indicated by ultra-high-pressure rocks and inclusions. That's one of those seemingly forbidden things in geology though, like those olivine-bearing granites!",

For example, we know the Atlantic is getting bigger (over the last 220 ma) and the pacific is shrinking. We know that north America is moving south with respect to the pacific ocean. We also know where new fissures are forming (imagine the new fissures that is growing to separate South America from Africa.) These are called triple junctions, and the most notable one is the red sea, a giant fissure that flooded. It also aligns with a section of Africa that experiences profound volcanic activity. I think lake Bikal in Russia may also be one, but im not sure.",

An unusually large and hot part of the mantle (the layer of the Earth between the core and the crust) rose towards the surface because hot things are less dense than cold things because heat is vibration and more vibration = more space between atoms.  This is called a convection current and we usually only see things like this with liquids or gases, but the solid rock in the mantle behaves like a fluid if you watch it for millions of years.  As the large hot chunk of mantle rose closer to the crust, the pressure on it decreased and it underwent decompression melting, turning into liquid magma.  This liquid magma then burst through the surface releasing a shit load of carbon into the atmosphere and causing volcanos to erupt for millions of years, creating a giant area of volcanic rock called the Siberian Traps.  [Look at how huge the Siberian Traps are - all of this was covered in lava.](https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/images/interviews/siberian_traps_map.gif)  Also, just to make it worse, as the magma rose to the surface it burned huge coal beds releasing even more carbon into the atmosphere.  When I say a shit load of carbon, I mean several times more carbon than we could release if we burned every last fossil fuel in existence today.  ~90% of all species went extinct, the temperature increased by 30 degrees F, the ocean became too hot at the equator for anything to survive in it, the oceans turned acidic and deoxygenated from all the sulfur the volcanoes were releasing.\n\nPangea formed 335 million years ago, 85 million years before this mass extinction, so I'm not sure which extinction he was talking about.  I know that the center of Pangea was so far from oceans that it had very extreme weather and there were some areas where nothing could live because the oceans cool land during the day and warm it up at night, but that wasn't a mass extinction.",

Life is amazingly resilient and has survived on Earth despite huge changes in atmospheric composition and climate.  Although this was certainly the closest life came to ending that we know of.\n\nYou might also be interested in snowball earth and the great oxidation event.  Snowball earth is thought to have been a state that has occurred more than once on Earth where the *entire* surface is covered in ice and life survived in water trapped under it.  It's thought that the only reason Earth didn't stay stuck like that is that as more water turned to ice, the sea level dropped until methane hydrates on the seafloor were exposed which then entered the atmosphere and caused a greenhouse effect which was enough to warm the planet up and melt the ice.  The great oxidation event occurred when plankton first figured out how to split CO2 into useful carbon and (for them) useless O2.  The only problem with this is that Oxygen is an incredibly reactive element and will form a compound with basically anything which fucked up the basic chemistry that a lot of organisms relied on to survive.  It changed the atmosphere from being reducing (wants to give electrons to other atoms) to oxidizing (wants to take electrons away from other atoms), which fucked up the ionic compounds organisms relied on to function.  Amazingly life survived this huge chemical change and even found a way to use the dangerous Oxygen.",

Pangea was formed during the Permian period, which lasted from 299 milion years ago untill 252 years ago (when the extinction happened). Because of the formation of Pangea, there was a lot less continental shelf than there used to be (because now all continents were united into one). Because of this, all the marine life basically had the fight for the few continental shelf left. This caused up to 95% of all marine life to go extinct.\n\nBut that wasn't all. The land on Pangea itself had an extreme climate. The poles were extremely cold and almost completely frozen and there was extreme drought at the equator. There was also a lot of vulcanism (that's what happens when continents collide) which obviously isn't good for the life there. Up to 70% of all the land vertebrates went extinct. It was also one of the few times when insects suffered severely. All of this happened in a period of a couple million years.\n\nThis was what I learned but I looked it up and it seems like there's some more theories about what caused the extinction. It could've been (partially) caused by an impact of a meteorite. It has also been proven that there was less oxigen in the ocean and a drop of the ^(13)C/^(12)C ratio by about 1% at that time.\n\nBut because the mass extinction is so severe, it's most likely caused by a combination of many factors so all of these could've lead to this extinction. It's not nicknamed the \"mother of mass extinctions\" or the \"Great Dying\" for nothing!",

The water contained within the oceanic crust then causes flux melting which leads to arc volcanism which creates felsic igenous rocks like rhyolite/granite and intermediate rocks like diorite/andesite.  However, the volcanoes that caused the End-Permian mass extinction formed the Siberian Traps in Russia, which are made of basalt.  Basalt is a mafic igneous rock formed when a piece of the mantle rises to the surface and undergoes decompression melting.  Therefore, we can be certain that the volcanoes that caused the End-Permian Extinction were not caused by pieces of the crust subducting, but rather by the mantle deep below the crust.\n\nI also don't think that changes the continental shelf would have as much impact on sea life as [the CO2 in the atmosphere going from 300ppm to 2000ppm and the O2 going from 30% to 15%](https://notrickszone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Permian-Extinction-Coincided-With-300-ppm-CO2-Isozaki-Servais-2018.jpg).

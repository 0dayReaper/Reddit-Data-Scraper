The local economy was in a constant state of decline, many industries failed to develop because they were outcompeted by foreigners (for example cheap English cloth imported without any taxes), and the country had a trade deficit with just about anyone you can imagine. Modern financial institutions remained pretty much non-existent, etc.",

It's still a gdp inflated by non-demoestic production. This makes about as much sense as saying the French were well-off because their slave colony on Saint Domingue produced the majority of sugar in Europe.\n\n&gt;The Portuguese economy was generally booming and developing well after the Spanish ruled Union ended in 1680. Until the Lisbon Earthquake in 1755, the economy was growing steadily.\n\nYes, in the late 17th century there was a recovery. Which is natural when you come out of personal union and a decades long war of independence. That didn't last until 1755, it fact it didn't last until the end of the 17th century, in 1689 real yearly wages in Lisbon were at a high with 49.000 reis. From that year on it continued to decline and by 1701 they were was as low as 18.000 reis. GDP/cp followed the exact same trend. It would take until the 1720s before Portugal experienced another period of growth (after the War of the Spanish Succession), which only lasted a decade and was followed by a long period of stagnation until the 1780s. And while it stagnated on a relative high point, that doesn't change the fact that it had stagnated and was not actually growing.\n\nPortugal had a negative trade balance of between 2 and 6 billion reis from 1720 to 1776, resulting in an outflow of Portuguese currency (i.e. Brazilian gold) to other European countries like Great Britain. In that same period the value of Portuguese exports was stagnant at around 1.65 billion reis, it did not grow until the very end of the century.",

So they only accepted payments in silver for foreign trade (whereas previously bartering had been common).\n\nMeanwhile back in Europe the Iberian countries controlled the overwhelming majority of the world's silver supply and were using it to buy stuff like cloths, grains, etc. and to pay back national debts to foreign bankers and merchants. So a lot of that silver ended up in the hands of merchants one way or another.\n\nEuropeans really liked Chinese stuff like silks and tea, the Chinese really needed European silver. Both had plenty of what the other wanted and large-scale trade ensues.",

It also says it\u2019s based on EU digitizations of those ships logs, so it may be very limited based on what survived over the ages, made it into archives, and did so within the EU. They may have been Spanish ships, but if they primarily plied the Manila-Mexico route their logs may never have made it into a European archive.",

International law did not exit yet either. So even invading or otherwise damaging another country by force for no reason was not \"illegal\".\n\nThe slave trade was extremely horrible, even compared to all the other horrible aspects of colonialism and of that time in general. But calling such things \"illegal\" in retrospect is pretty meaningless. Even though we all today agree that it was wrong and many at the time also found it wrong it has nothing to do with \"legality\" but with morals.",

As always the rich could be above the law in some cases, but having Christians as slaves was not accepted. The few people brought to the Netherlands from the slave trade are documented and nearly all were baptised in secret to become free. Some of these now-free Africans or ones that came by boat but were never a slave in the Netherlands (more often their children) became servants with a higher salary than white servants as they were seen as a very interesting \u201cfeature\u201d, often compared with a muze in modern times. It\u2019s very interesting how Africans were treated in the colonies compared to inside the Netherlands. Just to be clear, slavery was only illegal inside the Netherlands.",

The Dutch naturally play a large part in that story too. The two countries and empire are very similar, although the scale is vastly different.\n\nHaving christian slaves inside Denmark was also illegal at the time. I meant that slave trading was legal by Danish and other European countries' laws. A few african slaves also made their way to Copenhagen as servants to their Danish 'owners' from the colonies. That was legal but uncommon and became quite the spectacle.\n\nA very curious case was a slave in the Danish Caribbean who claimed to be a prince from his quite powerful home tribe in Ghana that was enslaved by some \u2018unjust\u2019 circumstance. The Danes didn't care of course. Until some newly arrived slaves backed up his story. The Danes didn\u2019t know what to do and ended up apologising, assigning him some personal slaves and sending him to Denmark for the authorities there to figure it out. He lived with his slave servants in a small house in a park for over a year and it became quite an attraction for the locals to go see \u201cthe negro prince\u201d. Until he was finally sent back to Ghana with an official apology and a sizeable compensation paid in gold and manufactured goods.\n\nReally bizarre case from our current perspective.  Shows the weird morals around the practice of slavery. And shows the situation at the time when the colonial powers only had trade posts on the african coast while local elites still held the power inland. Way before the Europeans started actually controlling territories and building modern colonies.",

Even today with our modern technology it's hard to open roads far away in the Amazon that's why there is no road to Brazil for example. \n\n2. The Dutch colonization style. The Dutch were just traders they weren't really settlers. And they were very brutal in the way they colonized Suriname. They were known to be worse than the French and British. They brought in slaves and after slavery ended there were only 30,000 left, of the 500,000 they brought in total. Then the white population mostly left after slavery ended, only the Jews stayed; of which there were also not many. Later they brought in Chinese, a total of 5000, a few Madeirans of not more than 200, a few farmers of 500, but they were treated badly by their own kind and left to die so more than half of that population died. Later they brought the Indians, a total of 25,000 and the Javanese a total of 24,000. Lastly there was a small group of Arabs too not more than 1000. \n\nAs you can see Suriname never had a lot of people and after independence a lot of people didn't agree and left for the Netherlands.

Schulte Nordholt, History, The People that Walk in Darkness: \u201cThe Dutch share in the slave-trade was large: in fact, in the 17th century, it was the largest. The Dutch West India Company had various settlements on the African coast, and millions of slaves were ferried from there, especially during the time of the Dutch occupation of Brazil. In 12 years (between 1637 and 1648), they transported no less than 23,163 slaves from Elmina and Loanda, for an amount of 6,714,423 guilders and 60 cents [the Dutch were very precise!]. They bought slaves from the Congo for 40 to 50 guilders and sold them in Brazil for 200 to 800 guilders. Certainly a worthwhile business.\u201d\n\nMarcus Garvey and the Vision of Africa, edited by the African-American historian and Egyptologist, John Henrik Clarke: \u201cThe Dutch had established themselves in Berbice in 1624. During the years 1624 to 1763 they were the cruellest of slave masters. The Dutch slave code was much harsher than the Spanish code. The savagery of the Dutch code is shown by one provision of calculated cruelty: the burning alive of mutinous slaves over a slow fire. The Dutch had no institution comparable to the Spanish audiencia, a tribunal which included four judges. The ruthlessness of the Dutch created the situation that came to a climax in the Berbice slave rebellion.\u201d\n\nChuka Nwanazia, DutchReview\n\n\"To illustrate the barbarity of slavery in the Dutch colonies, one picture that comes to mind is that of a slave hanging from the gallows with an iron hook through their ribs, while in the background are a set of skulls rested threateningly on stakes.\"\n\n\"For example, he describes how a certain Mrs. S. was fed up with the crying of a slave\u2019s baby: \u201cMrs. S. ordered her slave girl to bring the child to her. She then took the child by one arm, held it under the water until it drowned, and then she threw it into the stream.\u201d After the mother tried in vain to save her child, she was mercilessly whipped for disobedience.\"",

The other colonizers (British and French) even thought so. \n\nThe Dutch had very inhumane punishments. They didn't abolish slavery, because they thought it was inhumane, like the British and French did. They did it out of pressure by those two, but would've kept it if they weren't pressured. And even after the abolishment, the slave owners asked compensation for each slave and got it. \n\nThe punishments were so grusome. Which is why Suriname has Maroons, but other countries (Jamaica aside) don't. The [Spaanse bok](https://www.absolutefacts.nl/img/geschiedenis/jean-baptiste-debret-het-gebruik-van-de-spaanse-bok-in-brazilie.jpg) is a well known example. You were tied so that you couldn't move and beaten constantly. Until your back ripped open. The Spaanse bok had such a big impact on the generations after, that parents used it 'till recently to threaten to beat kids to behave. It became a synonym for a heavy beating (child abuse). \n\nThere was a guy Stedman who documented the life in Suriname during slavery. One incident he wrote about was where he saw a young, well-built enslaved African walking very lame. The man turned out to be a runaway whose Achilles tendon had been severed to cure him of his urge for freedom. [This picture](https://www.athenaeum.nl/media/1737567/roofstaat-4-1_200x280.jpg) shows a man hanged alive from his ribs. [Here](https://www.athenaeum.nl/media/1737566/roofstaat-4_200x272.jpg) a woman hanged from a tree. [Here](https://www.athenaeum.nl/media/1737569/roofstaat-6_250x314.jpg) an enslaved forced to break another enslaved's limbs. One incident also recorded was a surgeon who was paid to cut of the legs of nine runaway enslaved, of which 4 died during or right after the operation. \n\n[This](https://www.athenaeum.nl/leesfragmenten/2016/roofstaat-wat-iedere-nederlander-moet-weten) link (use autotranslate) explains and visually pictures the grusome treatment the Dutch gave the enslaved. And even then I find they wrote it from a eurocentric pov. Especially in Dutch. It's like they're trying to neutralize the or soften the impact. \n\nAfter and right before the abolition of slavery, they treated other people badly:\n\n* They dumped their own kind, the Boeroes (Dutch Farmers) in a swamp and left them to die (literally) from disease, while being promised a lot of good amenities and housing. They refused to remove them from the swamp at first, but later it was granted that they could move. \n\n* They treated the Chinese badly. Changed their working contract behind their backs and basically degraded them to slaves. Beat them heavily, almost close to lynching. They were forbidden to live in town, and lived in shacks on the edge of town. And they also had a curfew. \n\n* Treaded the Indians badly. Starved them to death, gave them bad housing etc. Beat them with the same tools they beat the slaves. The death toll was so high, which is why the British stopped sending them. Imagine how bad it must have been, if the British, who were also inhumane, thought the Dutch were inhumane. After a new deal on food, housing and clothing they sent Indians again. \n\n* The Javanese were basically at the mercy of the Dutch. Unlike Indians that had the British that could control the Dutch, the Javanese had no one. They came from the Dutch East Indies (modern day Indonesia) a colony also controlled by the Dutch. They came here, because the Dutch didn't agree with the British  their rules for the Indians. Looking at old pictures, you'll see that they look like underfed North Koreans in work camps. \n\nThe Dutch had for the indentured servants the \u201cpoenale sanctie\u201d. It meant that not civil law, but criminal law provisions were in force for breach of contract and that, for example, a plantation owner could impose heavy penalties or punishments on workers as long as they were under contract. And these punishments were harsh. It wasn't until 1948 that, that law was abolished. \n\nIn Indonesia there were also poenale sancties. One story that is known is that of a 15 or 16-year-old Javanese girl who was tied naked to a cross in the sun for hours. Sambal (very very spicy Javanese hot sauce or paste) had been smeared on her vagina to prevent fainting.\n\nEDIT: And between 1900 and 1954, it wasn't much better even. The mass grave of the Indians and using cyanide to hide it. The shooting at protesters; for better working conditions. The sort of apartheid system by governor Kielstra. The imprisonment of Louis Doedel and the hidden documents of what they did to him. The treatment of Anton de Kom etc. Only after 1954 did it improve a bit as Suriname officially became a country because of the 'statuut'. But irl still a colony. The Americans invested more in Suriname than the Dutch did imo.\n\nEDIT 2: And also not having mentioned the war they fought against the Maroons, how they burned their villages, forced them back to work, punished them and used dogs to attack them, which is one reason why Maroons have stigma on keeping dogs 'till today. Also the wars forged against the natives, which is not talked about a lot and unfortunately is not even taught in schools here (you only know of it if your teacher tells you).",

From here, the ships headed west, sailing a round Cape Farewell in Greenland and into Hudson Strait, south of Resolution Island. Once in the bay, the routes diverged, either south to Moose Factory or more westerly to Churchill or York Factory. \n\nOn the return voyage, the majority of ships travelled back to London again via the Orkney Islands, but occasionally some took a more southerly route towards the English Channel and Thames Estuary; arriving late September or early October.\u201d",

Perhaps the cutoff point of 1750 for this map, just when the Spanish Empire is beginning to weaken, might have explained that.\n\nFirst at Manila, part of the Spanish Philippines, the Spanish would load their ships with trade goods bought from Japan and China. The ships would ride the Pacific trade winds all the way to Acapulco, Mexico, then part of the Spanish East Indies. \n\nThe cargo would then be moved by land from Acapulco to Veracruz on the Atlantic-Caribbean side, from where they will be loaded on another ship to be shipped back to Spain.",

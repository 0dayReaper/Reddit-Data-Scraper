The real downside is that uzbekistan has no desire to restore the sea since it would require letting both of Central Asias main rivers flow back into the Aral (something that currently only happens during floods). They make too much money and get too much influence in the region by withholding the rivers since it allows them to have far more agricultural output than otherwise possible, namely for cotton (cotton takes an absurd amount of water between the growing, cleaning and production processes)",

It's one of the most contaminated sites in the world and the Soviets simply abandoned it intact in 1991 without disposing of the literal tons of biological agents at the site leaving them unattended in deteriorating conditions. The facility itself had a history of contaminating the neighboring area at the best of times such as when weaponized smallpox escaped containment and infected people on 1971. 10 of the Anthrax dump sites have been indentified and properly taken care of through American funding of the Uzbek cleanup, but more remain and some agents like plague can spread to animals as well and there has been a resurgence in the area in recent years that lines up to the deteriorating conditions at the facility.",

                            "comment": "&gt; This is basically northern Canada\n\nFor those not getting this, over 1/3 of the lakes here are in Canada (partially or fully) and part of the [Canadian Shield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Shield). Great Slave Lake, Great Bear Lake, Reindeer lake, Lake Winnipeg, Lake Superior, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, and Lake Athabasca are all in the Canadian Shield, and surrounded by thousands of other lakes. The Canadian Shield is a remnant of the last ice age, where ice stripped away most of the soil, leaving a huge area of rocky forest, swamp, and lakes that makes up over half the country.\n\nAs examples, [Here's](https://www.google.ca/maps/@59.1239239,-109.2914535,151871m/data=!3m1!1e3) Lake Athabasca, [Here's](https://www.google.ca/maps/@57.2469144,-101.3556238,190402m/data=!3m1!1e3) Reindeer Lake, [Here's](https://www.google.ca/maps/@61.8143408,-113.5963974,279562m/data=!3m1!1e3) Great Slave Lake, and [This](https://www.google.ca/maps/@61.4916788,-110.8064322,1383157m/data=!3m1!1e3) is Great Bear, Great Slave, Athabasca, Reindeer, and Winnipeg lakes (top left to bottom right) plus a few thousand more.",

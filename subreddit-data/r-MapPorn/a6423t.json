Gotta transit through Hong Kong or Tokyo, and then the 10-14 hour flight. If you're not going to LA or DFW then another transit from there.  \nNot to mention the price. A lot of people in Indonesia are not well off by western standards. The cost of that trip, plus a place to stay, transportation, food, etc, is a bit beyond many of them.\n\nThere are, of course, many who do actually make it to the States. I was talking to a doctor a while back who had spent a couple months there. I think he said his cousin lives in California.  \nBut, ya know, doctor.\n\nAlso, Australia is pretty close, globally speaking, so Indonesians who want some \"Western culture\" will often go there first.\n\nAnyway, Indonesia is cool, it's just a pretty different world from the West in many ways.

In my head space, Indonesia is part of a completely different \"realm\" and Australia and New Zealand are basically far off Western outposts. It also doesn't help that Australia's population is in the same league as Texas or Taiwan but Indonesia is in the same league as USA or Pakistan.",

The only country with more (as of 2013/2014, which is when most of the data on Wikipedia was sourced) was Malaysia (2.5m), which also makes a lot of sense -- and between the two countries you're almost halfway to the total.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said, as a Canadian who is currently living in the Netherlands, basically the only thing that I remember being news re: Indonesia was the huge tsunami in 2004 that killed 200k people or whatever it was. It's changing now as people become more exposed to the world and general interest in travelling has increased, but the essentially my exposure to Indonesian culture has been entirely limited to the 6 months I've been living in the Netherlands, and I expect that's more than most Canadians/Americans have unless they actively search for it.",

Ok, I can live with that. I suppose that's why Australia isn't on the list. BTW what exactly counts as a continent anyway?\n\n&gt;A continent is one of several very large landmasses of the world. Generally identified by **convention** **rather than any strict criteria.**\n\nOh. So if we change the convention of Australia being a continent, we can include it in the next version of this map.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

To put it in perspective the earliest dates are around the time Alexander the Great was born, the roman republic was 150 years old, and the great pyramid of Giza was already 2200 years old. And for comparison the first settlement on Great Britain was 30 000 years ago. Also, interestingly the first settlers of Madagascar is by people from Borneo, not Africa.",

This strikes me as the single most astonishing fact of human geography for the entire world. It's as if Columbus, on reaching Cuba, had found it occupied by blue-eyed, blond-haired Scandinavians speaking a language close to Swedish, even though the nearby North American continent was inhabited by Native Americans speaking Amerindian languages. How on earth could prehistoric people of Borneo, presumably voyaging in boats without maps or compasses, end up in Madagascar?  ",

Maybe if they were in a lake instead of a river, then freshwater islands could count.   \n- 6 Antarctic Islands. Also checks out, you can walk to them because they're glaciated year round.  Maybe once climate change kicks our asses, these could count. I guess it's just a matter of time for these guys.        \n- And that just leaves: Wrangel Island. Why was Wrangel left off? Get outta here, Guadalcanal!   \n   \n",

National boundaries aren't based in the same intuitive, biologically-palpable markers, and can be quite defined quite arbitrarily. Will humans innately know they've crossed into another country if there were no signs, border posts or other markers to indicate it? It can be difficult even to know when we've crossed a county line, or even across private property lines. Signs and border posts are the human equivalents of scent markings, of course - but then if there are no signs, would we even notice the border?\n\nSo I think we can say that we have an innate tendency to be territorial, but the exact scale and nature of those territorial boundaries are extremely flexible for us. We're not reliant on physical scent marking, but on highly abstract social processes. The countries we have today would not at all have been intuitive or sensible to humans living 3000 years ago - the idea that communities could exist on such a scale would seem ludicrous. Hell, people in the 13 Colonies did not at all think of each other as living within the same community just because they lived within the same federal country line. But generations pass, narratives are created, and presto, the 13 Colonies become the USA, not just administratively, but intuitively and socially. So it's something that ultimately can be immensely flexible.",

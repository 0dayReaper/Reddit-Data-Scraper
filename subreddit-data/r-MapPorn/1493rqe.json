Greenland and the Faroe Islands have devolved legislatures same as in the UK.\n\nLaws in the Danish parliament apply to the whole Danish state unless any specific area have been exempt in the laws. So if a law is not to apply to Greenland, it literally has to be written in the law.\n\nThe Faroe Islands had home rule prior the EC/EU and asked to not be included, when the Danish state otherwise joined. Greenland was very much included, but later asked to be exempt form the EC/EU.",

Denmark proper doesn't have a separate parliament from the Danish Realm. Instead Faroe Islands and Greenland each elects representatives to the same parliament that governs Denmark proper. This the same that happens in the UK, with Scotland, NI, and Wales all electing representatives to the same parliament that governs England. \n\nThe real difference is that in Denmark the state is named after the dominant region, whereas UK pretends to be a Union of equals. That has more to do with history than current legal relationships though. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDanish treaties apply to Faroe Islands and Greenland unless otherwise specified. Comparisons can be drawn with Northern Ireland during the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, where Northern Ireland is treated differently from the rest of the UK for customs.\n\nFaroe Island and Greenland also have similar status to Scotland and Wales. The difference is that they are established longer, and are more geographically distant so there is less friction over there status. Northern Ireland is the only possible exception as it owes its status partly to an international treaty, and partly to internal legislation.",

The UK also dominates the UK.\n\nConstitutionally, Greenland and the Faroe Islands are Denmark just as much any other area in the state of Denmark.\n\nBut you're right, that Denmark proper holds some 98% of the population in Denmark :)\n\nIt's also true, that \"Denmark\" is often used to refer to Denmark proper and Denmark's formal name, the Kingdom of Denmark, is used to include the whole state.",

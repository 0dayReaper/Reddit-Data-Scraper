You could travel 40 miles in a straight line without leaving Jacksonville limits. If you went like 37 miles southwest of Boston youd be in Providence, RI\n\nI used to wonder about this because Boston is considered a large TV maeket, which didnt really make sense to me until you realize that theres a whole bunch of towns/cities that someone from out of town would just assume are part of the city",

You could count the whole of Santa Clara County, since it all feels like part of San Jose, which has a population of 1.7 million. But really, the true metro area is the entire Bay Area which is all connected urban buildup, which is some 9-10 million people.  \n  \nBut yeah San Jose city limits are really arbitrary. Basically, in the 1940's San Jose was a pretty typical city of some 100,000 people iirc, with city limits being very reasonable. Over the next decade, San Jose's mayor had the city buy and annex tons of land, increasing the city area some tenfold. He was trying to copy LA. But as a result, we have a very small downtown for a city our size, and most of the city is just suburban sprawl that spills over into small cities like Saratoga, Campbell, Santa Clara, Cupertino, Milipitas, Willow Glen, etc without any noticeable difference. Go to google maps and click on San Jose to see the city limits in red, it's a fucking mess.",

I'm Peter from the [\"Vexillographer\" YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Vexillographer) where I talk about flags and geography if you also find that nerdy stuff as fun as I do. This particular map has been a work-in-progress of mine for a few years now. It started out a fun little geography mind game for myself, and now thanks to quarantine I've finally had the time to just about finish it. There were lots of unexpected surprises around the world about which cities and towns reign supreme in which squares.\n\nThanks to everyone who provided the following corrections - I'll try to keep this list updated over the next few days:\n\n* Caracas, Venezuela, is more populous than Santo Domingo. ([comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/hevc9i/the_largest_city_in_each_10by10_degree_area_of/fvtz7ip/))\n* There is a permanent research station on Jan Mayen Island, Norway. ([comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/hevc9i/the_largest_city_in_each_10by10_degree_area_of/fvtw9f4/))\n* Dingle, Ireland, is more populous than Clifden. ([comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/hevc9i/the_largest_city_in_each_10by10_degree_area_of/fvttr73/))\n* Antofagasta, Chile, is more populous than La Serena. ([comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/hevc9i/the_largest_city_in_each_10by10_degree_area_of/fvv7afb/))\n* Cape Dorset, Canada, officially changed its name to Kinngait in 2019. ([comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/hevc9i/the_largest_city_in_each_10by10_degree_area_of/fvvkv7a/))\n* Kashechewan, Canada, appears to be slightly more populous than Moosonee. ([comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/hevc9i/the_largest_city_in_each_10by10_degree_area_of/fvviwem/))\n* Rankin Inlet, Canada, appears to be slightly more populous than Arviat. ([comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/hevc9i/the_largest_city_in_each_10by10_degree_area_of/fvufn5k/))\n* Kazan, Russia, just recently surpassed Nizhny Novgorod in population. ([comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/hevc9i/the_largest_city_in_each_10by10_degree_area_of/fvvf8og/))\n* And major props to u/yourrabbithadwritten for thoroughly researching many of the remotest squares and finding a plethora of helpful corrections! ([comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/hevc9i/the_largest_city_in_each_10by10_degree_area_of/fvxc1g6/))\n\nEDIT: Updated version of the map, with corrections, [available here!](https://www.reddit.com/user/PeterVexillographer/comments/hgqbij/largest_city_in_each_10degree_area_of_the_world/)",

Or they could have moved away from Bakhmut and attacked a different place at the front and do the same. One way or another, you ***will*** have significant losses when the enemy is using human meat waves. Retreating doesn't solve any of the problems and a slightly better tactical position is not always worth giving up entire swaths of land for.\n\nThe Ukrainian leadership is much more aware of the lives loss than we are. We have no reason to assume Zelensky is ignoring the human cost or ignorant of it. The only logical conclusion is that Ukraine evaluated the pros and cons, and decided that defending the city was the best course of action.",

Even under Zelenskyy their rights have been restricted, but that can be explained by war-time pressures rather than ideological ones. \n\nPretending this isn't a danger for Ukrainians is as absurd as the guy you're responding to saying that Russia's \"liberation\" isn't a danger to Ukrainians.",

If you actually think that Putin cares about defeating Nazis or saving Russians living in Eastern Ukraine then you don\u2019t understand politics. \n\nEverything Russia says is worthless. Before the invasion started, they conducted the heaviest propaganda campaign to convince people like you that the invasion isn\u2019t happening. Every word said by the Russian government is valueless propaganda.",

Also while it hurts Russian prestige it also could make the average Russian feel more angry at Ukraine.\n\nRussia after all has never shied away from retreating or temporarily handing over territory in war. Neither historically nor now.\n\nIt also hurts Ukraine's image a bit. It has generally portrayed itself as \"only fighting to drive Russia out of its territory, not to conquer\". Which while in my opinion true, does not reflect as well internationally if axtual territorial pushes are made into, in this case, uncontroversially \"Russian Territory\".",

For Russia, it was an actual offensive operation aimed to capture Kyiv and quickly end the war. That\u2019s why you saw high concentration of Russian air and ground units in the North.\n\nThis is nowhere near that scale and is more like a distraction aimed at increasing Russian forces withdrawal from Ukraine to defend the Russian border.",

There is no conspiracy going on to hide the Clone Army and secretly fight against a \"good\" Russia\n\nNATO doesn't pump money and gear into Ukraine. Every country does that by their own motivation to help a country that is invaded by an attacker.\n\nSure, NATO expanded its rocket interception capabilities in Eastern Europe. But it's only a defense. It would be completely unimportant as long as Russia doesn't attack anyone.\n\nIt was even in Putin's reach to stop this idiotic \"west vs us\" polemic and actually join us all. Then we would have been able to trade with each other, visit each other and live peacefully with each other. But no, he needed to invade a country.\n\nIt sucks for an attacker when the world doesn't accept this medieval behavior anymore. We all want to live without being occupied by Russia. If that's a condition that's too much to ask, then I don't know what to say.",

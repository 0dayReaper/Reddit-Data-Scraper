The monarchs aren\u2019t very tyrannical like 40 something years ago. New sultan seems smart, best way for them to continue moving forward in my opinion would simply be to begin drafting a proper constitution.\n\nJust kinda icky to know that the crown prince of Oman married his 1st cousin.",

So disposing of Bin Ali actually had a decent chance of changing things for the better, at least short term.\n\nAnd I think it should be added that maybe the Arab Spring was good for the countries that avoided violent regime changes, like Algeria, Morocco, Jordan and Oman? I'm not sure how exactly their leaders managed to pacify their populations.",

It is worse now, but it was still bad during his time. Libya and Kuwait are no different in this regard  \nHe opposed the very idea of Berbers in Libya calling themselves Berbers(essentially Arab supremacy) and he never recognized the Tuaregs of Libya as actual Libyans. Little wonder both have sought to establish autonomous states within Libya and oppose both the closeted Jihadists in Tripoli and Haftar's LNA.  \nAnother false claim here is that Libyan oilfields are being exploited by the West now in the Post -Gadaffi period than under Gadaffi. That is false. Most of them preferred Gadaffi because he barely demanded much from them. The post Gadaffi era saw Western oil majors assets suddenly under a Pro-Russian warlord .The biggest beneficiaries actually been the UAE which has acquired oil assets from the retreating Western majors actually.",

Goebbels' propaganda won the historical war in the mainstream so people believe in invincible German armies, an imponent air force bombing their enemies ruthlessly, perfect tanks, Soviets attacking in human waves and even that Hitler fixed the economy. Germany was thrown into a self-destructive war economy in the 30s to pay for rearmament and the only minister who had the guts to call that out was the President of the Central Bank Schacht who begged Hitler to stop the neck-breaking militarization in 1936. He ended up fired.\n\nThe Bruning government started building the Autobahns, the economy began recovering under Papen (the Nazis actually lost seats from early to late 1932 because of that), all Hitler did was keep those policies at first and then turn everything to build up a war machine, but he did cut back a lot on the home front and development. The Nazi Social Welfare, such as the Winter Scheme, was basically a mass extortion plan, they plundered the wealth from Jews and anyone they declared an enemy of the state, and at times such as 1935, Hitler's popularity was actually shaky.\n\nThe Hitler golden years are a myth in history. And it's terribly unfair to compare 90% of the world's dictatorships to Nazism, they are something completely unique.",

But one year doesn't say much since Hitler took power in 1933. \n\nLook I get it. Hitler is bad. And probably his short sighted economic reforms and massive loans (for the long term) too. But it helped the economy at that time. Hitler came to power precisely because of an economic downturn due to international limitations because of WW1.",

Every democracy was once a tyranny. \n\nBut democracy can only rise up under certain conditions.

In an interview in March 31,1977 with the Dutch newspaper Trouw, Zuhair Mushein, Palestinian Arab who was leader of the pro-Syrian Al Saika faction, a terrorist organization, and head of the Executive Council of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), exposed the myth of a Palestinian nation with a separate \u201cPalestinian identity,\u201d when he declared, \"There are no differences between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. We are part of one people, the Arab nation\u2026Only for political reasons do we carefully emphasize our Palestinian identity. The fact is that it is in the national interest to encourage the existence of the Palestinians against Zionism. Indeed, the existence of a separate Palestinian identity is only for tactical reasons. The establishment of a Palestinian state is a new means of carrying on the struggle against Israel and for Arab unity\u2026. After we have gained our rights to all of Palestine, we must not for a moment postpone the reunification of Jordan and Palestine.\u201d Also, prior to entering the Knesset in 1996 as head of the Arab Balad party, Azmi Bishara declared: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think there is a Palestinian nation at all. I think there is an Arab nation. I always thought so and I did not change my mind. I do not think there is a Palestinian nation, I think it\u2019s a colonialist invention - Palestinian nation. When were there any Palestinians? Where did it come from? I think there is an Arab nation. I never turned to be a Palestinian nationalist, despite my decisive struggle against the occupation. I think that until the end of the 19th century, Palestine was the south of Greater Syria.\u201d Do I need to bring more sources or are you going to just shrug it off because of the propaganda you\u2019ve been fed from, I\u2019m going to assume, the other side of the world?",

That's a lot of countries there. Compare that to the Arabs and that is a quantum difference. Not terrible at all.",

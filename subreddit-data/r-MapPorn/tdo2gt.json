Most young people start clubbing at 2-2.30 am, after bars close.

This is an idiosyncrasy left over from the Franco era.\n\nThat means that 9 PM (GMT+1) in Spain looks and feels more like 8 PM (GMT), because the position of the sun doesn\u2019t care about Franco being an idiot and wanting to suck up to Hitler by joining his time zone.\n\nSeriously, that\u2019s why it happened.",

Turim is huge and having long days in the summer is a plus and people from the west wouldn't appreciate having the sunset so early. Also, in winter the sunset is much earlier and you're having dinner at night time the same time as you would in the summer so the position of the sun is kinda irrelevant half of the year. \n\nSecondly, having a late dinner isn't only about the time, it is cultural. We Spaniards have our whole life structured around it with an afternoon snack created to fill that time and our late work hours (many office workers finish at 7 and shops at 8 or 8:30), even our prime time hours on TV are later than the rest. \n\nFinally, I've lived in a \"correct GMT\" and I didn't change my routine. In some ways it makes the day longer. \n\nSo....it may have started as one of Franco's stupid measures to be more like Germany but it has become part of our culture, even with the correct GMT I wouldn't expect changes at least from me.",

The change just stuck and never changed back, so the sun rises and sets one hour later than it should.\n\nFor instance, today 14th of March, the sun sets at 19:30 in Galicia (north western Spain), while in Lublin (eastern Poland) it sets at 17:30, even though the total day length is almost the same as we're nearing the equinox.

And lunch is early, like 12:00 noon. Exactly. On the dot. Like clockwork.)\n\nSo, there's a component here that non-Southern Europeans are not aware of.\n\n\\*Edited slightly.

Even the times cited on this map are misleading imo, since many people in Italy have dinner earlier and later than this timeframe. In my family dinner is a big meal and we often take more than an hour, like we start at 20:30 and we end up at almost 22, this is because it's often with more stuff to eat that needs separate cooking, for example you can have vegetables while some meat is cooking and also slicing bread to eat with some \"salumi\" which are finely sliced meats that go super well on \"pane sciapo\", bread without salt which is common in at least 2 central regions (Tuscany and Umbria). And in the end everyone waits around to drink coffee which takes 10 minutes to do, and help with the dishes. My girlfriend eats a sandwhich or a piadina and takes maybe 30 minutes to have dinner in total, some friends of mine stay on the table far longer than necessary just to talk with their families or roommates in order to have news about what happened, what to do the next day etc...",

So i like to think that i shifted merenda with dinner, and I'm happy.\n\nIn the weekend the dinner time is different: there is not a fixed one. You eat what you want when you want.",

We are rather early eaters:\n\n- my grandma's generation (silent/pre-boomer) staunchly eats at 5PM, or maybe a specific time after that, related to the arrival time of the husband from his work (I know, doesn't really sound emancipated at all).\n\n- late-boomers and gen X has less of the tendency to eat that early, many starting between 17:30 and 18:30 when out of work, and sometimes a bit later: commute times are longer and overwork has become more common. But also, the time zone has shifted since 1939, winter being 40min later and summer being 100min later than solar time (the latter existed during WW2 and since 1977).\n\n- my generation, late-Y and Z has much more in common with international students and expats and are more familiar with their cultural traits. Add some global warming to that so that during summer it's too hot to eat at 18:00 or even 19:00 for several weeks, and thus times vary more greatly. My generation is no longer looking weird to eating at 20:00. My grandma would be shocked to hear about it, my mum would think about our holidays in Spain.",

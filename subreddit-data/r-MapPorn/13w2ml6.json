                    "comment": "I think the more populist bent of the NDP has more appeal in Alberta. \n\nBut the Liberals were relevant for most of Alberta's history. They were the government from 1905-1921 and the official opposition from 1921-1940, 1952-1959, 1963-1967, and 1993-2012. \n\nThe NDP being the main competitor is recent. Their predecessors, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation,  were the official opposition from 1948-1952, then the NDP itself was the official opposition from 1982-1989, then they had almost no seats until they won a majority government in 2015. They've been the official opposition again since 2019.\n\nWorth noting that the Liberal brand is pretty much dead provincially west of Ontario, and Alberta has actually been the outlier in terms of the Liberals remaining relevant until recently. In BC, the Liberals largely died out in 1952. They resurged in the 90s, but as a right-of-centre party unassociated with the federal Liberals, drawing their support mostly from former Social Credit voters (Social Credit was the dominant right-wing party in BC from '50s till the '90s). They changed their name this year to \"BC United\" (yes, it's an awful name that sounds like a soccer team). \n\nIn Saskatchewan, the Liberals last formed government in 1967, were last the official opposition in 1995, have won zero seats in 7 of the last 11 elections, and currently have no seats. \n\nIn Manitoba, they have 3 out of 56 seats, haven't had double digits since 1990, have formed the official opposition once since 1967, and last formed government in 1953.",

In fact, between the last election and this, it looks like few UCP voters turned NDP. Instead what happened was that the Liberal vote and the Alberta Party vote went entirely to the NDP.\n\nIs this permanent? Well, probably. The Liberals were only able to field 10 candidates this year. While the NDP got $7.2 mil in donations in 2022 and the UCP $4.4 mil, the ALP got $97,000.\n\nTruly, Manitoba is the only province in the Western half of the country with a functioning Liberal party at present.",

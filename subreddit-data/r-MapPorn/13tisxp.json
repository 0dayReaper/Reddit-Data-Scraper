It\u2019s not cumulative/year-to-date because the graph from a week before shows 40mm in the same area, so it\u2019s still be saying 6+ inches in a week. So what *is* it saying???",

Its fertility rate has barely dropped in the past 70 years, and in fact due to reduced mortality, its population is growing  even faster today.\n\nThe reduced availability of resources like food and water isn't nearly as impactful as the increased need for them. Ultimately, Somalia's population is projected to   increase   30 times in the 1950-2100 period for which the UN has information.",

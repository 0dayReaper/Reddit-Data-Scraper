Heck, there are even some states in the US where some FORMER prisoners are not allowed to vote...\n\nIs this a case of the US having unusual rules or is Turkey the odd one here?",

But those are so rare that in practice you cannot lose your vote (except if you give up your citizenship and even then iirc you can still vote in local elections). \n\nIn 2019 there were only 25 people ineligible to vote, most of them people who helped the nazis in their occupation of NL during WW2. But of course they die out so the amount decreases quickly.",

I think that there have been some legal rulings on their constitutionality. There was one prominent case on Sikhs and beards as part of freedom of religion. But since most states do not allow prisoners to vote, I would guess it is considered constitutional or it would have long ago been overturned. \n\nAnd most Americans (69% in a recent poll are okay with that. So it might just be an American vs. European thing.\n\nInterestingly and somewhat similarly I think, there is a fair amount of legal issue on what minors have in terms of constitutional rights, including first amendment rights (school newspapers) and privacy (search and seizure like looking in their lockers for contraband) while they are in school",

Some amendments concern the question of what due process is, what rights you have before due process and in the case of the amendment that ended slavery, it clarifies that freedm of labour does not apply to people who have gone through a fair trial, though it fits with the rest of the constitution.\n\nIn more recent times, the issue of convict rights has become an issue, and the supreme court has decided that certain rights are so fundamental that even a fair trial with due process can't take them away based on reinterpretaions of the constitution, though as stated, the constitution explicitly states that freedom of labour does not apply to convicts so that one cannot be overturned even with shifting interpretations of the constitution.\n\nI think there is a major contention over whether a convict only loses their rights during their time in prison or whether the trial itself strips you of your right until the court decides to undo the removal of the right or they set a limit to the  punishment in their original decision.\n\nFor example, if you murder someone with a gun, presumably a judge could rescind your right to bear arms, but does that only apply during your prison time, or is this something that you have to live with forever as a sepaarate punishment? What if you don't get prison time but instead get a fine and cannot own a gun, presumably it doesn't apply until you pay the fine? Is it unfair to strip someone of a right forever even if they have done their time in prison, at which point their punishment in theory should end? Difficult question, and this debate is essentially how the argument about voting rights goes. Honestly I don't really like the idea of people who are currently in prison voting, but after prison I think there is a good argument for the right to be acnowledged again.",

Unlike the consensus in the US that prisoners should not be allowed to vote, the majority of Americans clearly favor ex-cons getting their vote back after having serve their time. \n\nRecently in Florida, there was a referendum on that --- Florida had earlier banned ex-cons from voting, but Florida voters voted like 60-40 to repeal those restrictions. However, the political party in charge of Florida (which begins with the letter \"R\") viewed those individuals as more likely to vote for their opponents and in the legislation \"implementing\" the results of the referendum basically undermined the intent of the referendum with a series of restrictions apparently designed to scare ex-cons from ACTUALLY voting. \n\nIt was grotesque, if I may editorialize for a moment!",

Ideally, I think no, since it doesn't make sense for people you want to re-enter into society and become reformed to be rendered voiceless and disconnected from it any more than absolutely necessary. You even questioned it for possession of pot, so clearly you've got some degree of flexibility on the issue, even if only for what you deem as minor.\n\nI personally fundamentally disagree with the US system of disenfranchising people en masse using the criminal justice system (especially given incarceration rates are higher in the US as well). I also frankly disagree with how the UK does things, even though it's much more relaxed and has more avenues for convicted individuals to vote, while still disappointingly barring voting for those in prison.\n\n[Apparently](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/12/innocent-people-us-prisons/) the conservative [estimates](https://innocenceproject.org/news/how-many-innocent-people-are-in-prison/) for the US prison population is that 1% are innocent. (Though it seems the first Innocence Project article that both refer to has become dead. [Other](https://www.georgiainnocenceproject.org/general/beneath-the-statistics-the-structural-and-systemic-causes-of-our-wrongful-conviction-problem/) [articles](https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/commentary/ct-perspec-innocent-prisoners-innocence-project-death-row-dna-testing-prosecutors-0315-story.html) put it between 2-10%). That said, even if guilty, it's debatable whether it is a positive thing to cut prisoners out of a civic duty which connects them to wider society. There is a difference between removing them from free access to wider society due to the damage they've done, and disconnecting them from it to the point re-entry is difficult and you damn yourself to the revolving door the US justice system is known for.",

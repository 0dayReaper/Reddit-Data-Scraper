Several regions are very isolated, others see insurgencies but even in Kinshasa there's barely a way to get tested or anything as the state is basically in shambles.\n\nCompare this to more prosperous and organized countries like Botswana, Namibia and South Africa. These however also had more contacts with people on longer distances which is why their numbers are pretty bad too and escalated to horrible levels before awareness and management came around the corner, but at least it's clear that most infected people nowadays are on the radar and now that it is preventable and manageable, which is why the storm has calmed down. This is very important: one of the fears that foreign institutions point out towards Uganda is that their new laws can be very dangerous. HIV can grow under the radar if testing is getting people in deep legal trouble, then it will fly under the radar again and cause a catastrophic disaster. And I'm not going to help them because Museveni wants people like me dead.",

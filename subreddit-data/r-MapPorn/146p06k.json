As for the 1945 events, it\u2019s true that France thought of conquering the Aosta Valley, which was mainly French speaking at that time (many, such as \u00c9mile Chanoux, had been tortured by the Italian government). \u201cTaking advantage\u201d is also relative in the context of Italy shamefully occupying France and killing thousands of civilians between 1940 and 1945 (bombardment of Marseille, executions in occupied zone and Corsica, etc.). Also the French were not \u201ckicked out\u201d of Aosta Valley by Italians, it was the US Army presence at Pr\u00e9-Saint-Didier and pressures from Harry Truman and the Allied Command that convinced De Gaulle and the French to leave the Aosta Valley definitely.",

They were both bad and clearly France had no moral high ground since what they did in central Italy with Moroccan troops was disgusting (search \u201cMarocchinate\u201d). In Aosta Valley the people spoke a French dialect and not French, and they didn\u2019t recognize themselves as French. And Fascist and Partisans DO fought together against DeGaulle, that\u2019s true Usa intervened, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that Italians successfully defended themselves",

If not for the French stalling Romells Africa Korps and the Italians, the Brits would have been unable to regroup for El-Alamein. And would have probably lost the control of Egypt and the Suez canal.

As it allowed the end of the axis push to secure oil access.\nAnd daily reminder, Hitler saw the Italians more like a pain in the ass than anything as he had to divert forces and material to support them each time.",

At best the Free French forces in the Western Desert were at Brigade strength including the Foreign Legion. They did indeed fight very bravely nevertheless.

Those were deemed absurd by the time of the 1910.  \nIn 1919  they began to care about Alsace-Lorraine when the Imp\u00e9ratrice Eug\u00e9nie found a letter of the first German Emperor about how those territory were taken because of their strategic value and not because they were \"germanic\".

Local languages were for peasants, and an educated mind would read and converse in French.\n\nI believe not much more forcing than that was needed. With centralisation, public education and mass media -- the amount of culture produced in French snowballed and it was dominant all over the territory I'd say at least after WW2.",

It's pretty interesting to visit, many old roads names are in italian, as are the surnames. If you visit the old cemetery its like 90% italian surnames. Also the names engraved on the monument in memory of the fallen in both world wars are mostly italian.\n\nIn '47 its inhabitants had to vote to decide if they wanted to remain to Italy or switch to France. Only 6% voted to stay.\n\nThis area is much more connected to France, as is separated to Italy by mountains that are hard to get across, especially in winter. So I imagine the citizens' life was already revolving more around France than their own country.\n\nIf i recall correctly all this area should have been given to France when Nice was, but in the end it was decided not to since it was part of the hunting ground of the Italian king.\n\nNowadays the connection with Italy is still strong, many can speak italian and often visit, and the opposite goes for the Italian part.",

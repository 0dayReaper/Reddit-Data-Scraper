I'm not scared of spiders in the least, but you should be cautious and aware in the cities.\n\nLast year we had a crate of \"backyard toys\" for the kids on the deck behind our house. It didn't get touched over winter. I went to clean some of the toys during spring and a giant fucking redback crawled out when I picked it up. I then tipped the crate over and started hosing the toys and four more big female redbacks and literally hundreds of males and baby spiders came out everywhere. We don't have a backyard toy-crate anymore - and when BBQ season commences each year I always check the cupboard and supplies beneath the BBQ. \n\nAnd guess where Australia's most deadly spider, the Sydney Funnel Web's primary area of habitat is?! (*hint:* the name gives you a clue).\n\nAnd don't forget the tiger snakes and brown snakes that live near basically all the creeks and rivers across Melbourne...",

Which although nobody has actually died from the venom in a very long time are potentially deadly. Same with funnel webs. And in coastal areas there are things to worry about in the water. I was wandering along a relatively busy beach and saw a blue ringed octopus that had been washed up. Bondi beach in Sydney gets bluebottles. And if you think we only have small spiders in the towns and cities you're nuts. Huntsmen spiders are huge and very common, although not actually dangerous to humans.   \n\n\nThere's no reason to just be scared, but people definitely should be aware of certain creatures and how to behave in certain areas. Misinformation like this is not only unhelpful but dangerous.",

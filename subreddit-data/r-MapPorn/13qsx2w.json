Sicily has SO many UNIQUE stuff that only Sicily has, yet they choose olives?!\n\nWhy not arancine, cannoli, cassate, iris, pasta alla norma, pasta al forno palermitana, pani ca meusa, stigghiola, pani e panelle, ... the list could go on, and these are things only (or almost only, since globalization) found in Sicily, while olives are definitely not its speciality.\n\nAnd I really don't know about Piedmont. I am both Piedmontese and Sicilian, so these are the regions I can speak for, and I never knew we had something special about our \"stuffed pasta\".  I would have like to see bagnacauda there for once.",

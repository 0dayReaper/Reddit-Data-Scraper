Warmia/Lubuskie or even Pomerania weren't majority Polish before WWII. Most of population is resettled and lives there for c. 80yrs. Big cities have also populations with a lot of new internal migrants.\n\nAnd then you have rest of Poland where average family stays there for 100+ years and this part is usually more reluctant to changes.",

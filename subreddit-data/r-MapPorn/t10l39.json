Milosevic fucked up our relationship with the neighbours and and since the NATO bombing and Kosovo conflict we were pretty isolated.\n\nOnly Russia and couple of other countries were interested to help like Russia and China (for whatever reason). We slowly began to rehabilitate but with the demand from western countries to recognise Kosovo it slowed down. So back to Russia and China, who pretty much gave us ton of vaccines and free stuff worth million/billions (obviously they have other goals too, not only to help us).\n\nWhat are you gonna do now? Recognise Kosovo and hope for the EU, which might be not even enough? Or stick with Russia and China (and couple others)?\n\nShame, because we could have such a beatiful friendship with our neighbours. We have a similar tradition and language. If I could go back I would kill Milosevic twice. Killing innocent Children and Civilians because they were muslims is barbaric.",

On the other hand EU can stop our process of joining. A really tough position so neutrality is the best we can do. The official stance for now is that Serbia recognises Ukrainian sovereignty, but won't condemn or sanction Russia. Serbia just doesn't want to get involved.",

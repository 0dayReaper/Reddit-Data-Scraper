Contrast with the equator, which is based on a completely natural line (the line that is perfectly perpendicular to Earth's rotational axis). Or put another way: If some country other than the UK had been a dominant superpower at the time, then the Prime Meridian would likely have been drawn elsewhere, but the equator-line would most likely have been exactly where it is regardless of which country happened to be a superpower (assuming the world still had the same general knowledge of science).",

Centering at 150E only cuts Greenland, and some rock with 4 people owned by Brazil away from Brazil; as opposed to cutting Kiribati and Fiji, which have larger populations than Greenland.\n\nIf you look closely there's actually a lot going on in the Pacific that you probably didn't notice because you're so used to the Atlantic centred map. There is a pretty wide spread of population across the Pacific, it's just that instead of being surrounded by, say, desert, they are surrounded by water so it gets marginalised in the standard maps.",

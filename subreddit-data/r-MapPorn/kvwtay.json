Turns out that during the dry season they have  no grass at all in the sabana and they feed chipped wood to the animals. Locals start to understand that not cutting trees might bring more grass all year round, and some shepards are in charge of maintaining the new trees protected. Young people in the area are aware, and little by little they help in that. \n\nIt is worth note, that in our camp there were some reporters that wanted to film in areas that were planted a few year ago, but they couldn't get in because wild animals such as pythons and chakals returned to the area. New flora and fauna are coming back to the desert. The project is in fact working. It is slow, and a pan-national project working with 11 different countries and 11 different constirutions. So most efforts are focussed in Senegal, we're the paper works seems to go faster in that sense.",

My French was not that good so details got lost in translation. \n\nAs long as I know. We plant Acacia Senegal, a kind of tree that need not much of a rich soil and water. It is a kind of bushy tree that allows bird to built their nest and they bring seed within them. Trees cast shade into the floor, cooling and allowing more plants to live and in so more animals. \n\nMoreover the project helps the community in a big scale. The project not also involves planting but also focusses in building wells and community gardens. The students in the area are able to get studiing materialsthanks to the community gardens they got in their schools. They get food for the staff and students and sell the rest. This helps them financing their school.",

They're halfway to the 'deadline' from when they started and only 4% of the \"tree wall\" has been planted.~~\n\nEDIT - Nevermind, my original memory was incorrect and gave too little credit to countries other than Ethiopia. Progress is at about 15% of the planned area planted, with 4% of the area actually now covered by the wall. ~~And it appears we're only roughly 30% through the originally proposed implementation period, depending on when you say it started~~ (it seems kinda arbitrary to pick a single date for the \"start\" of the project so I chose 2012, the year a harmonized regional strategy was adopted). ANOTHER EDIT: I actually can't find if there's no actual hard \"goal date\" to complete the project, but with reports that the population of the region is set to double by 2039, that's the rough approximation of a \"goal for completion\" that i used.\n\nEthiopia is indeed doing well, but it seems like Senegal has been the most productive so far. From the Wikipedia article:\n\n\"Though no other source for this can be found, in September 2017, the BBC reported that progress was best in Senegal. As of March 2019, 15 per cent of the wall is complete with significant gains made in Nigeria, Senegal and Ethiopia. In Senegal, over 11 million trees had been planted. Nigeria has restored 4.9 million ha (12 million acres; 49,000 km\u00b2) of degraded land and Ethiopia has reclaimed 15 million ha (37 million acres; 150,000 km\u00b2). In September 2020 it was reported that the Great Green Wall had only covered 4% of the planned area, with only 4m hectares (9.8 million acres) planted. Ethiopia has had the most success with 5.5bn seedlings planted, but Chad has only planted 1.1m. Doubt was raised over the survival rate of the 12m trees planted in Senegal.\"",

I sure don't. Is it the immediate aftermath of a reforestation project? A 'five years' later' photo? What did the land look like before the process began? Which vegetation was disrupted? None of it's explained leaving the reader to make guesses like \"Mmm.. I think those few trees were planted as reforestation but maybe it didn't work?\" which is so sloppy that all I can do is shake my head. The image titled '*Global Deserts and Drylands Map'* is another poorly thought out visual aid that's probably better suited for /r/mapgore than a serious discussion about dryland science.\n\nIt's unfortunate that the choices of visuals in the article undermine its points because they're good ones that more people should know about.",

When people do attempt to reproduce his \"method,\" or just follow his advice, their results *never* live up to his promises, and he always blames *them*.\n\n&gt; In 1990, Savory admitted that attempts to reproduce his methods had led to \u201c[15 years of frustrating and eratic results](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0921800991900319).\u201d But he refused to accept the possibility that his hypothesis was flawed. Instead, Savory said those erratic results \u201cwere not attributable to the basic concept being wrong but were always due to management.\u201d In a favorable [interview with Range magazine in 2000](http://www.rangemagazine.com/archives/stories/fall99/allan_savory.htm), Savory seemed unconcerned with the failure of his method in scientific trials: \u201cYou\u2019ll find the scientific method never discovers anything.

Large scall biome-forming like that is an incredibly complex task with many small gears, thats why ecology is a separate subject to \"simple\" biology. You not only have to plant trees, but select fitting shrubbery, promote groundwater restoration, reduce surface erosion which is more of a bio-engineering task. And that doesn't even touch socio-economic issues.  \nA project like this can (and has never) work(ed) without support by local communities. Food security is still a rather large issue in the Sahel and firewood is the primary energy source for basically everything. People need infrastructure, education (not just general, but farming techniques) and basically a whole new type of regional sustainable economy has to be developed. The list just goes on and on.  \nEdit: I studied and worked as an environmental planner, so I only have a bit of insight in that topic.

And who\u2019d ever scrape together funds and a coordinated human force to maintain such an artificial forest? I knew Atlantropa was unrealistic, but this is getting up there. \n\nWanna help the African economy? Decrease transport costs. Build a canal through Angola, Zinbabwe, and Mozambique. Give Ethiopia a natural harbor for crying out loud. There\u2019s a reason Nigeria exports crude oil to Chinese refineries over other African countries\u2014they\u2019re landlocked. Even the Nile\u2019s useless at certain times of year for cargo ships!\n\nI guarantee you that giving African countries better access to the sea year-round would be literally quadrillions of times more helpful to the African people than this incredibly inane, utter waste of hard-earned wealth from the African Union. It\u2019s insulting and mocks any common sense on the part of lawmakers and the AU.",

It does not try to develop local communities, doesn't really think about the water ressources, and relies heavily on foreign money. \n\nHow can this be called \"sustainable\"?\nI'm sure there are better things to do than wasting billions on a silly geoengineering project.\n\nAm I missing something?",

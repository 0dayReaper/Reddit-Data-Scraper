Guaranteed it's lower than Mississippi, and the lowest in US-Canada.\n\nI'm not saying this to bash on Nunavut, quite the opposite: they've seen a population boom with little in the way of infrastructure investments, their clinics periodically close due to staff shortages, classrooms go without teachers, and the high CoL and cost of transportation drags down the overall quality of life for Nunavumiut.\n\nNot to mention the fact that they have the highest rate of TB and suicide in the OECD.",

While you do have the option of building your own house up there, the cost of bringing up the supplies and equipment are astronomical, and can only be delivered via the once to twice a year sealift. As a result, and with such a high birthrate, housing in NU is both in a severe shortage and overcrowded to the extreme.\n\nAnd overcrowding can start to have a domino effect on various health issues. It's a major contributing point to TB rates up there.\n\nAllegedly, a report had estimated that it would cost $1 billion to fix the housing crisis in Nunavut, but that report was in 2018. And Canada has a tradition of government projects going 100%-300% over budget depending on which company gets the contract (Bombardier, Irving shipbuilding, and SNC-Lavalin come to mind). So realistically it would be in the range of $5 billion or so. And why would our government spend that for a single parliamentary seat when you could spend that on vote rich Toronto or Montreal.",

However, [Global Data Lab](https://globaldatalab.org/shdi/table/)'s national and provincial estimates from the same year are quite different, so I would take this with a grain of salt (I would be surprised if it were below 0.810 or above 0.860 though).",

Minnesota ranked 16th lowest for homelessness in the US and the numbers for sheltered people in Hennipen County seem to be between 600 to 500 with another 10k facing housing instability/chronic homelessness according to the sources I've been able to find.

The city of Calgary itself is large in area, but it isn't surrounded by a tight halo of other communities. Probably 80%-90% of the CMA population lives within Calgary itself. Unlike the GTA where under 50% of the population live in Toronto.\n\nYou can still get out of the city from anywhere you live in under 30 minutes. That's not at all what my experiences have been like in the GTA.\n\nYou are right that it is fairly car centric though. Which has both its pluses and minuses. One study a few years ago named Calgary the best driver's city in the world. So while you do have to drive a lot, it doesn't tend to be an overly stifling experience. And with the wealth of nature at our fingertips you're going to want drive to get out to places anyway.\n\nIf I could fix anything from a driving perspective it would be to make our suburban communities more village like. Put the central plazas in the middle rather than edge of communities to make them more walkable. And change zoning laws to promote things like corner stores, cafes and pubs within other parts of the communities so that everyone has access to a 3rd place on foot. And mandate that every community have a community centre and an outdoor rink and hold their construction to higher standards. They tend to be really hit or miss. Our neighbourhoods don't need a drastic rethink to cut down on car trips. I don't care if I have to drive to the hospital or hardware store, but I shouldn't have to drive to grab a loaf of bread or a pint.\n\nMy biggest pet peeve in neighbourhood design though is how badly adjacent communities interact with one another. Even if a neighborhood itself is nice and fictional it tends to be very self contained. The sides are going to be cut off by arterial roads and oppressive fencing and parks or pathways in one community will suddenly end and not be picked up on the other side. We need more coherent area planning. It shouldn't just be about how a neighbourhood interacts with itself.\n\nI think some of these problems are actually symptoms of Calgary's high centralization. Money, attention, commuting, it's all geared towards the downtown. I'd love to see the city devolve to boroughs. So that planning and tax money can be focused closer to where people live and want to live, not just where it's trendy.",

So you'd compare the 1st/bottom decile (0-10%) in Mexico City to the one in Alabama or Tennessee. I happen to be familiar with both, and I do think you can see a difference in the middle middle class in Mexico (CDMX, Nuevo Leon, QTO, etc...) even with states in the Deep South. Just compare a city like Auburn or Huntsville, which are relatively small to Puerto Vallarta or Quer\u00e9taro. Even these states like the map shows have lower average educational attainment and incomes even when compared at at purchasing power parity (PPP).",

The USA using the same metrics appears to be 39th in the world on percentage of their population being immigrants, with 15% of the population being immigrants.\n\nWhile I will admit the US was a bit lower than I expected, my general point still stands. Though honestly I am even more confused about the disparity in HDI score and what exactly it takes into consideration in what quantities.\n\nEither way it is quite embarrassing for \u201cthe greatest nation on earth\u201d to rank lower than literal autocratic monarchies!",

They do have an issue with treating low-wage foreign workers terribly, but a huge chunk of the foreign workers are not in the lowest rung of the totem pole. They also go to universities there and get degrees in saudi/UAE/qatar schools and start families there and often get professional jobs and end up with pretty solid salaries. There are tons of middle class and even upper class parts of these cities that are 90%+ foreign and are somewhat integrated into society there. As with America unfortunately (albeit its worse over there), they have well-adjusted, educated immigrants, and then we have a lot of poor migrant workers who work in bad conditions. \n\nThe stories we hear about horribly exploitative labor are mostly those who are lured in by corrupt companies under false pretenses and treated horribly and often not even allowed to leave. But just to be clear, this is not 'the norm'. If it was, nobody would emigrate there. Those are basically scam job listings, and they have been widely cracked down upon in recent years (as well as various labor right bills passing in most gulf state countries) It was estimated that nearly 50,000 workers in the UAE had their passports revoked, which is horrible, but its out of *8 million* total foreign people there. The large majority are just people who go to work pretty normal jobs or go to university there. \n\nI would not be surprised if they are counted in HDI ratings.",

That is not uncommon at all. A very large chunk of the foreign population has basically settled down there nowadays and made a living and started families. These countries have ridiculously generous education programs. A huge chunk of the migrant population is from middle class homes in their home country, but move to UAE for higher salaries. The median salary in Dubai is 69,000, *including the 8 million non-citizens*. That is extremely high. Yes, a lot of non-citizens work as poor workers.  Among the poorer workers, conditions are horrible. That is a major issue. They have these corporations which effectively do engage in indentured servitude, targeting poor south asians and africans. But that is not the majority of non-citizens there at all. Dubai has lots and lots of middle and even upper class filipino and indian/pakistani neighborhoods. \n\nNow, the smaller gulf states (dubai, qatar, bahrain) are much better off than Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia has a gdp per capita of 23k, compared to 78k in qatar (used to be nearly 100k in 2013).",

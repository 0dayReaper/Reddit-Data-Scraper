                    "comment": "Yes, Ukraine blew up the dam because it so obviously benefits them. Let\u2019s look at all Ukraine has gained: \n\n1. Any possible offensive operations across the river will be delayed by at least a few weeks now. This coming right as Ukraine was increasing attacks across all areas of the line. It makes no sense for Ukraine to blow the dam and halt their own advance. Not only did blowing the dam flood the region, making armored advances temporarily impossible, but the dam itself was also one of the few remaining bridges across the river. Although no sane general would order an attack across such an exposed bridge, it logistically could have been useful for supplies and reinforcements to pass over once the area had been secured. \n\n2. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant will lose access to the reservoir. This will disable Ukraine\u2019s massive nuclear power plant (the largest in Europe) for even longer than it already has been, denying Ukrainians electricity, and risking a nuclear incident with the left over heat. \n\n3. 16,000 Ukrainians made homeless, on top of the millions of already displaced Ukrainians the government has to deal with. \n\n4. The canals flowing from the reservoir that supply water to Ukraine\u2019s vital agriculture in the south, Ukraine being the breadbasket of Europe, will now run dry and Ukraine\u2019s agriculture will suffer even more. Harvests will fall drastically, and all the cattle downstream will drown. \n\nLet\u2019s also consider why Ukraine could not have blown the dam even if they wanted to: \n\n1. The dam was built during the Soviet Union and was specifically designed to be able to withstand enemy bombardment. Firing explosives at the dam from the outside would be ineffective. The only way to blow the dam with any reasonable amount of explosives would be a demolition from the inside. It should also be noted that no missile or artillery fire was reported in the area of the dam the morning it burst. \n\n2. The dam was under Russian control and occupation. The Russians were the only ones with access and control over the inside of the dam. Only they could have placed charges inside the dam to destroy it. It should be noted that russian authorities are also downplaying the effects of the flooding. Why would they do that if it was an enemy attack?",

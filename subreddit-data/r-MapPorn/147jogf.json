And, in fact, german Deutschland. It's an old germanic word, roughly translated, it means \"of the people\" or \"belongig to the people/ the tribe\". \n\nSomething based on \"saxon\", like finnish Saksa\n\nSomething based on \"germanic\" like german in english or germania in italian\n\nSomething based on \"allemannic\", like french allemagne or turkish almanya. The Allamans were a group of tribes living in modern day southern Germany and Switzerland. \n\nSomething based on \"niemc\",  slavic for silent or mute, luke polish niemcy. Simply refering to the fact that the germans the slavs came in contact with, mostly saxon invaders, but also settlers from all over the empire, didn't speak a slavic language. I really like this one. \n\nWith the names based on \"saxons\" and \"allemans\", those were just the tribes people had contact with when the words developed. The allemans were a tribal confederation living along the southern rhine, where they had contact with the the gallo-romans there, and the saxons lived in the north of the eastern-frankish or german Kingdom and were one of the driving powers behind the \"easter-colonization\". (centuries before they also conquered England, which is why the word for the English in some insular-celtic languages is also derived from \"Saxon\", e.g. \"Sasana\" in irish-gealic)\n\nThe \"\u00feeudisk\" root is germanic itself and is a translation of what germans call themself. it refers to the language the (lower class) people spoke in the east of the frankish empire, compared the galloromanic of the western frankish people and the latin of the clergy and higher ups. This leeds to some confusion in english, since \"dutch\" refers to people from the netherlands, who are germanic, were part of the empire and even call themselves \"german\" in their anthem. So a \"dutch angle\" has nothing to do with the netherlands, but is a \"deutsch Angle\", and the Pennsylvania Dutch are actually the Pennsylvania Deutsch.\n\nEdit: I left out the 6th way: The various other stuff with weird outliers or names that cannot be explained. Lithuanian, for example.",

Thengel or \u00deengel, Theoden\u2019s fathers name means \u201clord\u201d. Then you have Folcwine which means \u201cfriend of the (common) folk\u201d or the people, basically because he is not included as a part of the people it has a meaning of \u201cthe lord who is friends with his people\u201d. This is a running theme in the language, words for \u201clord\u201d are often derived from words meaning \u201cpeople\u201d or \u201cthe people\u201d. Presumably describing their lordship over those people. \n\nEven \u00c9omer which at its face mean \u201cHorse Famous\u201d can be translated as Horse Master or \u201cHorse Ruler\u201d because to be famous for horses usually means to be famous for riding or breeding them which has obvious connotations of ruling over the animal in certain ways. Tolkien\u2019s knowledge of language both real and fictional never ceases to amaze me.",

But that's not always what it meant.\n\nShakespeare references them in plays published between 1597-1599.  This is before any successful English settlement in North America.  But it is clear he expects his audience to know \"turkeys\" decades before North American products (more easily like shipped) like tobacco were commonly recognized by the groundlings.\n\nIn Shakespeare it is usually as \"turkey-cock\"--describing a chest-puffing man man displaying his colorful plumage.  In short, a comedically pretentious character.  \n\nEnglish settlers in North America then then transferred the name \"turkey-bird/turkey-cock/turkey\" to a completely different species with characteristics like they're understanding of colorful strutting \"turkeys.\"\n\nYou can't expect 16th century people to know where their novelty imports originated.  Probably not from Turkic lands, but possibly from the more distant Orient.  Or any simply a catch-all for colorful foreign fowl.",

That's still not likely, as there's an alternative etymology from ro\u00fe, deriving probably further from ro\u00f0smenn. That's very likely made its way from Old Norse to Common Finnic as roocci, and then from there tacked onto Old East Slavic. Roslagen was not populated enough to stand out enough to become a large name, so it's more likely originates in words like ro\u00f0smenn.",

The best way I can describe it is to say the word \"You\", take out the first half so you're left with that kind of \"oo\" sound, and purse the lips to put it in the back of your throat. Yhdistynyt would then be \"ooh-dee-stoo-noot\" (in a very simplified way).\n\n-Anything with a double letter like Kreikka should have a \"halt\" of sorts on the double letter. The way I explain it to my American friends is that you almost have to stick the landing on those. In a different way of thinking, imagine you have to split a syllable at the meeting of those letters. In this case, think \"Kreik-ka\" and really distinguish the split, and you've got it. \n\n-Anything with the \"-uo-\" letter combination just needs to be pronounced individually before you get the hang of it. So \"Su-o-mi\", \"Ru-ot-si\", \"Pu-o-la\". Once you have the sound down, just increase the speed.",

Brandishing a firearm for the purposes of intimidation is an offence, even if you're doing it to scare an invader off your own property, and using it except in circumstances where your or someone else's life is in imminent danger will end up with you being charged with further offences. If someone starts cleaning out your grow op, you can call the police, but otherwise you have to stand and watch until the robber comes at you with a weapon.\n\nSome people think it's absurd that one can't protect one's property, but others think a human life shouldn't be ended just to preserve one's finances. The former generally consider the life of a criminal to be lesser than that of a law-abiding citizen, while the latter don't consider execution to be appropriate even for a criminal, especially in a country that doesn't have the death penalty. The majority of Canadians consider it preferable that property crimes be resolved by the police and insurance after the fact, rather than killing someone for siphoning gas or breaking into a truck looking for change.",

In civil lawsuits, affirmative defenses include the statute of limitations, the statute of frauds, waiver, and other affirmative defenses such as, in the United States, those listed in Rule 8 (c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In criminal prosecutions, examples of affirmative defenses are self defense, insanity, and the statute of limitations.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

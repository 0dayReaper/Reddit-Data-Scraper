Basically as laws were created around ages of consent, marriages, and the general public shifted their views on woman + child rights, people literally just kinda forgot that you could technically marry Children.\n\nLike since 2000, I don\u2019t think there has been more than 300,000 child marriages, and an overwhelming majority of those marriages are between children with ~3 years of difference (16 - 18). Which, in a nation of some 332 million people and 73 million kids, 300k is effectively a statistical error.\n\nThe only reason why there aren\u2019t laws being created *now* is due to the extreme political polarization, gridlock in the courts, and just that laws are kinda hard to pass.\n\nObviously not *defending* it, but it\u2019s literally just people forgetting that this is a thing lol.\n\n &gt; age of consent in all states is 16 - 18, how does this work in practice?\n\nParents and courts have to sign off on the couple basically.",

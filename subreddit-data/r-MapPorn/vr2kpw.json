And since there was no German nation state, \"German\" simply referred to the language he spoke. In that sense, you could say Mozart was as much German as he was Austrian.",

They actually export milk cultures around the world, and I'm guessing that's the reason for the Japanese yoghurt's name.\n\nEdit - Correction, the bacteria does not grow only in Bulgaria, but it was isolated by a Bulgarian scientist.",

They were cruel and definitely brutal leaving no mercy for them, and definitely not weak... A simple search of the first contact between the Portuguese and the Japanese may suggest this stereotypes is arguably untrue. Especially when battles like the \"Nossa Senhora da Gra\u00e7a incident\" (where 40 Portuguese fought off 3000+ samurai over 3 days and refused to surrender, so they just exploded themselves in a ship to kill the most samurai they could. And this whole thing would have been avoided had they just betrayed their captain and gave him in to the samurai. But they chose to fight for their captain) gave the Japanese an even exaggerated impression of the Portuguese fighting skills and bravery for hundreds of years\n\n (\"The British historian\u00a0C. R. Boxer\u00a0noted the great effect that Pessoa's actions had on how the Japanese see Portuguese people. According to Boxer, the event apparently gave the Japanese an exaggerated impression of the fighting qualities of the Portuguese, as well as appealing to the Japanese samurai mentality due to Pessoa's rather un-Christian act of suicide. As such, stories of the event were told and retold again over the next hundred years, often in an exaggerated and wildly inaccurate manner, and found themselves embedded as part of local folklore\").\n\nSo, I really do have a hard time believing that the Japanese see the Portuguese as weak at all.",

It's not like they don't or have never publicly admitted to war crimes or officially apologized. If you're interested in learning more, Ian Buruma wrote a book \\*The Wages of Guilt\\* which is about the collective memory of WWII in Germany and Japan, and comparing Western guilt with Eastern shame culture.",

I'm looking at my son's World History A textbook, from his public high school, and it says on page 181 that the Japanese military captured Nanjing in December 1937 and massacred Chinese military and civilians.  \n  \nIt doesn't go into any depth -- just one sentence, no casualty numbers, no descriptions of what the massacre consisted of. That said, the description of the atom bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are equally succinct -- \"The US army dropped atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August, the USSR broke its treaty with Japan and joined the war, and Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration, ending the Pacific War.\" One sentence, no concrete description, no casualty figures, etc.  \n  \nJapanese history textbooks are strange. They cover *so much* that half the time you're thinking \"What, you have to learn *that*?\" and the other half the time you're thinking \"What, you don't learn *that*?\" But it's two sides of the same coin: in order to cover a shit-ton of material, everything is *super* brief.  \n  \nGlancing through the textbook: \"In the 6th century, the Khmer Kingdom rose to power. In the 11th century the Pagon Dynasty was founded in Myanmar.\" No other information about them.  \n  \n\"In ancient Rome, the Gracchus Brothers attempted reforms to address the problems of farmers who were destitute due to long periods of conscription and the influx of low cost grain, but their reforms failed.\"  No information about what the reforms consisted of, nothing about who they were. Just, plunk, that sentence. The whole textbook is like this, to cover as much information as possible.  \n  \nHis junior high school textbook was much better about providing background and connections. I can't remember what it said about Nanjing there, but I remember it was a *little* longer. Maybe two sentences, not one.  \n  \nJapanese history textbooks are pretty shitty, no denying it, but reddit (or, I guess, the anglosphere) has got this kind of warped image of them. Sure, I'd like them to cut back on random historical details and instead explore certain topics (Japan's actions prior to and during WWII chief among them) in more depth, but it's not really the redditor image of \"they cover all this other stuff but then they skim over their atrocities\" so much as \"they cover every goddamn thing, which means that they skim over *everything*.\"  \n  \nEdit: I checked my younger son's junior high school textbook for comparison. The reference to Nanjing is much vaguer than I remembered: \"The Japanese Army captured Nanjing in December, and many prisoners of war and civilians were killed.\" This may be a different textbook than my older son used when he was in junior high, I don't remember.\n \nThe Hiroshima and Nagasaki section is also slightly longer: \"Due in part to its efforts to have superiority over the USSR following the war, the U.S. dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 6 and on Nagasaki on August 9. In Hiroshima, over 200,000 were killed (including those who died later due to radiation) and in Nagasaki over 100,000 died, and the cities were destroyed.\" \n \nEither way, it's not a lot of material. The junior high textbook is less direct about Nanjing and more detailed about Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but it's still a fairly minimal amount of info for both.",

                    "comment": "Polish people being stupid is a derogatory meme/joke that existed long before the internet and was not made up by the Japanese. From Wikipedia: \n&gt; A \"Polish joke\" is an English-language ethnic joke deriding Polish people, based on derogatory stereotypes. The \"Polish joke\" belongs in the category of conditional jokes, whose full understanding requires the audience to have prior knowledge of what a \"Polish joke\" is. As with all discriminatory jokes, \"Polish jokes\" depend on the listener's preconceived notions and antipathies.[1] The relation between the internalized derogatory stereotypes about Polish people, and the persistence of ethnic jokes about them, is not easy to trace, though the \"jokes\" seem to be understood by many who hear them.[2] Sometimes an offensive term for a Pole, such as \"Polack\", is used in the joke.\nExample:\nQ: How many Polacks does it take to change a light bulb?\nA: Three \u2013 one to hold the bulb, and two to turn the ladder.\n\n[wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_joke)\n\nIt\u2019s basically the type of joke a racist grandpa would tell. Thankfully it seems like younger generations are letting this type of humor die. But it didn\u2019t come out of left field for this map, there\u2019s a history.",

We see them more like brothers and sisters living in different places, we respect and love them because of our deep bonds.\n\nTherefore if I should say 5 other countries besides the ones I mentioned above, 4 of them would be Japan, South Korea, Italy and Spain. Turkish people have very friendly image in their minds about these countries and their people. 5th country that Turkish people love most would probably be Germany but it is a little complicated :D Also note that most of the Turkish people really love Ukrainians and Polish people too",

Otherwise they're just shitty propaganda...\nThere's no point on depicting Atamaca over Buenos Aires. It's just nosense.",

We still have some limited institutional memory and regional infrastructure occasionally works better. \n\nThe coming years will be much worse though as we\u2019re entering the second decade of a fierce brain drain (the diaspora is about a fifth to a fourth of the country\u2019s population) that has basically robbed the country of not only its current generation of professionals but the previous one as well.\n\nAs older people retire, there\u2019s no one to fill those spaces. I\u2019m 30 and left about 7 years ago. Even then it was incredibly easy to move up professionally because everyone used good positions in the country to fund their emigration and find good work abroad.",

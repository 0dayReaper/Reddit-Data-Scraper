Possible insofar as it started as a military language and could easily have been influenced by British eccentricities, but maybe they're just messing with us. Any Urdu speakers around to comment? Is this a word with this meaning in your language?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.urdu2eng.com/peccavi-urdu-meanings.html#:\\~:text=1](https://www.urdu2eng.com/peccavi-urdu-meanings.html#:~:text=1))%20peccavi,%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%81%20%D8%AC%D8%B1%D9%85",

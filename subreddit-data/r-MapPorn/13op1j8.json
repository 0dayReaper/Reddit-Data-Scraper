For instance \"dollar\" comes from the Spanish \"dolar\", that in turn derives from the German \"Taler\", that is a contraction of \"Joachimstaler\", that refers to Joachimstal (Joachim's valley), currently  J\u00e1chymov in Czechia, where there were mines of silver.\n\nAs u/pfo_ says, dark green should \"Taler or the like\".",

Spanish dollars or \"pieces of eight\" were distributed widely in the Spanish colonies in the New World and in the Philippines.[16][17][18][19][20]\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_dollar\n\nThe history of the United States dollar began with moves by the Founding Fathers of the United States of America to establish a national currency based on the Spanish silver dollar, which had been in use in the North American colonies of the Kingdom of Great Britain for over 100 years prior to the United States Declaration of Independence. The new Congress's Coinage Act of 1792 established the United States dollar as the country's standard unit of money, creating the United States Mint tasked with producing and circulating coinage. Initially defined under a bimetallic standard in terms of a fixed quantity of silver or gold, it formally adopted the gold standard in 1900, and finally eliminated all links to gold in 1971.",

They created their own currencies, which shared the same name with the British one. \n\n\n&gt; Wouldn't that just make trade more difficult with the conversions? \n\nThe name of a currency isn't relevant to how much it's worth. Canadian dollars aren't worth the same as American dollars which aren't with the same as Australian dollars which aren't with the same as East Carribean dollars and so on. Meanwhile the Namibian dollar is pegged 1:1 with the South African rand, despite having a completely different name. \n\nThe Egyptian pound was initially pegged to the British pound, but not at par. It stopped being pegged to the British pound in the sixties (when they instead pegged it to the US dollar).\n\nThe Sudanese pound was pegged to the American dollar started in 1958 (again, not at par). Not clear what it was worth from independence in '56 until '58.",

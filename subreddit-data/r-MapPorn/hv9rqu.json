Orangered is an intermediary step between orange and red. Is a bandwagon somewhere between a band and a wagon? Of course not; it's a type of wagon. \n\nI think it's fair to regard orangered as distinct from both orange and red. If you want to classify it as a red because red is the primary color, that seems reasonable, but I can't imagine many people draw a hard distinction between orangered and redorange based on the arrangement of the two constituent words.",

Egypt and eastern Libya are particularly problematic here because it's impossible to tell from the map how far south the Caliphate extended there.  Yemen gets cut off too and Iraq blends a bit into the Persian Gulf, but those are more aesthetic issues, Egypt and Libya actually effect the information the map is meant to be providing.",

I don't think they granted them any land though.",

But i'd argue that unity is more important and even then when a culture conquers another they influence each other in such a way that you could argue a new culture is born and the former cultures get to live on through it.\n\nAn example, Rome conquered Greece but Greek culture didn't die, it instead became part of a far greater culture we know today as the Greco-Roman one, greek words became roman ones too so the language gets to live on too.",

I live in Brazil and am part of an entire culture built out of enslaving and murdering other people and stealing their lands. Sure, we built a huge nation with a mostly unified culture out of those ashes but at what cost? The only way to judge these deeds is comparing our world with what could have been if people were left alone and technology and culture exchange could have happened on peaceful terms.",

Europeans forced them to assimilate to European culture, everyone around the world, from Washington to Beijing, is heavily influenced by European culture, especially when it comes to how they direct their economies and how they do science, before the scientific revolution in Europe no one gave a shit about studying science in a systematic way now the myth of science is deep ingrained into everybody's brain, we believe in science with as much passion as we used to believe in gods.",

The measure by which we judge history should always be human dignity, human lives, people's rights and freedom of choice, not the abstract notions of modern development you insist upon. That should always come second to people's actual lives and right of self determination.\n\nYou also lack imagination. As I said, the only measure of comparison we can use is between what is and what could have been, not comparing 18th century nations with their present, post-colonial, selves. Not only is that a poor comparison, since last I heard we do have many examples of nations that were never conquered by a western power but did integrate just fine into our western-created world economy - Japan and China being just the most obvious examples. But also, what right do you or anyone else have of telling people that want to remain isolated from the outside world and live a traditional lifestyle that they are wrong and should have modernity violently imposed upon them? If you think that's so morally justifiable you'd probably want to conquer the sentinelese people for example, killing every one of the archers that shot an arrow at you in the process, and justifying to yourself that one day a hundred years from now one of their descendants will write a scientific paper.",

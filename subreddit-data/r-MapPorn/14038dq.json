After all it's highly unlikely the Japanese nobility of the 30s was under-fed.\n\nI haven't seen any real definitive explanation for this, but the least stupid speculation I saw was that rice is very high calorie but very low protein, and corn/wheat are much higher inprotein. So if the grain in your diet while you're growing is corn or wheat you get more protein and grow bigger.\n\nGenetic explanations fail miserably because Japanese Americans are about the same height as the rest of us, so it kinda has to be diet.\n\nEDIT: I found a map on [Chinese Wheat production](https://ipad.fas.usda.gov/rssiws/al/crop_production_maps/China/China_wheat.jpg) that shows that taller parts of China tend to have wheat, whereas the shorter regions [tend to have rice](https://ipad.fas.usda.gov/rssiws/al/crop_production_maps/China/China_Total_Rice.jpg).\n\nThe seacoast/seafood vs. steppes/beef is also both relevant and related. Cows grow good in wheat country, fish are easily accessible in rainy areas that support rice paddies.",

I think it's common knowledge that typically Caucasian and Asian people have relatively longer torsos than west African people (the swimmers and runners Olympic observation)... and while people might find it less politically correct to identify nowadays, a lot of ethnic groups tend to have different physical builds. I guess I'm asking if there are known Asian stereotypes that I'm not aware of (people from Manchuria are typically lanky, people from Szechuan are usually stocky, etc). \n\nEdit: I hope that's not offensive. I'm not like a weird ethnologist with a spreadsheet haha. I think a lot of western stereotypes go unsaid at this point, so the same might be true of the east.",

I was a picky eater who mostly drank milk and ate McDonald\u2019s AKA the western diet. My sister loved all seafood including the eye and tail of the fish AKA the Asian diet.  I grew up with two more Asian families in my town where there was an 8-12\u201d height difference observed between brothers based on western vs Asian diet.  We did grow up in the rBGH era, so that could be a major factor in a beef/dairy vs seafood argument.",

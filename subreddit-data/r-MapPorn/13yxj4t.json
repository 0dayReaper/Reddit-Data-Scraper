The Marshall plan was irrelevant for the Wirtschaftswunder. \n\nThe Wirtschaftswunder happened because most of the German industry was still intact after the war (the allies mostly destroyed cities, but a lot of industry was not located there). And it had modern machinery due to the production of all sorts of war goods. This machinery could be used to cheaply mass-produce civilian goods as well. And boom, the Wirtschaftswunder happened. \n\nSource: https://www.thalia.de/ul/shop/home/artikeldetails/A1000926289 (only in German, but Abelshauser is the authority on German economic history)",

Europe had a larger economy than the US pre-WW2, that size of industrial base and economy doesn't just 'vanish' because of a war.\n\n*The Marshall Plan's accounting reflects that aid accounted for about 3% of the combined national income of the recipient countries between 1948 and 1951,\\[6\\] which means an increase in GDP growth of less than half a percent.*\n\nWestern Europe GDP in 1950 was 1.398 trillion compared to the US 1.455 trillion",

Most war bonds took 60  years to get paid back , this is money the UK's own citizens lent to its government to buy stuff from the US which was mostly given to the Soviets.\n\nBritain carried most of the bill for fighting the Nazis, the Marshall plan was great though, genuinely one of the best things the USA did. It massively helped. \n\nHere is an example, my grandfather was a clothing dye factory manager in Derby, during the war the factory converted to making explosives, he was in Germany even before the war ended working for the British government, he lived there until 1952 helping rebuild german industry, when the job was done the now functioning factories were handed back and he returned to the UK, were he was left unemployed, the factory he managed was left abandoned until the 1960s when it was demolished, there was no money left to rebuild the UK economy. \n\nReally, if it wasn't for the discovery of North sea oil Britain would still be a poor nation.",

The americans provided a lot of stability and peace after the war for sure, but i don't think soviet control of europe was ever truly on the table.",

The Dutch people were starving at war's end with much of their land flooded. \n\nOther countries had strong prewar communist movements. There was a legitimate concern that all these countries could start installing communist governments which would be sympathetic to Moscow.

I just recognise the fact that it would be expensive, it would mean wed have to cut back on social spending we love so much (or raise taxes already at record high), and it would take a decade to make all necessary changes. And importantly, Europeasn aren't willing / ready to make those strategic decisions.",

Moreover, how come the most affected countries, those how actually lost the war and were actual carnage compared to theatres like France and Britain that was never invaded since William the Conqueror, received much less? So the US helped Europe resurge from surviving the forces of evil? They basically profited out of a war they cherished upon since it was not in their soil.

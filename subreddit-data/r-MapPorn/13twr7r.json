All other Parties in Germany have pledged they will never ever form a coalition with the AFD. Thats why they wont govern anything. 50% is nearly not possible in Germany. Good luck getting 2 Germans to agree on something, then try it with over 42 Million (half the population)",

Im guessing for Berlin it would be SPD and for BaW\u00fc the CDU, and all others would stay the same. NRW would also be interesting to know, since I know that the Rhineland is traditionally very CDU friendly, while the Ruhr area is a hardcore SPD area, so which region would usually win out in politics?",

            "comment": "Since the results are indeed surprising and the poster did not take the time or care to explain a bit what those numbers are, here's a bit context. Here are the numbers from the 2022 report with a bit more details : [https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2023/world-happiness-trust-and-social-connections-in-times-of-crisis/#ranking-of-happiness-2020-2022](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2023/world-happiness-trust-and-social-connections-in-times-of-crisis/#ranking-of-happiness-2020-2022)\n\nIt seems like the final number we see is the sum of 6 factors, them being: GDP per capita (of course), social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, perception of corruption. Already there is an obvious tendency to favor rich countries with two of these, GDP per capita and healthy life expectancy. Generosity seems to be a very subjective choice, since while nice I don't see how much it impacts an average inhabitant's life.  Looking at the report, it seems like it builds a lot of its indices of a method called PCA, which basically tries to extract *linearly* from a large amount of data what correlates with what. With this method you end up with conclusions in the terms of \"in this dataset, when x increase by a certain amount, y tends to decrease by a fixed amount as well\". This is of course a big case of causation versus correlation, since both variables can move together due to another unknown third factor. \n\nThe seemingly arbitrary choice of variables as well as the very \"standard\" results (Europe &gt;= NA &gt; Asia = South America &gt; Africa) make this study very dubious to me. A variable that Western countries are usually bad at, that seems closely linked to happiness but that is omitted here, which is suicide would, especially for Finland, give some very different results.",

            "comment": "I just made an account because I have to comment on the Global Happiness Index, which pisses me off every time I see it posted. It assumes people's happiness is based on factors totally unrelated to happiness. I've been to eighty countries, I know this is subjective, but the correlation is not there at all. Madagascar has some of the most care free and satisfied people I've ever been around (on average), Denmark had people coming out of the wood work to tell me how depressed and suicidal they are. This map is based on a very Westerncentric mind set that more things=more happiness. It implies that before the Industrial Revolution, or agriculture everyone was just incredibly depressed until progress took hold and here we are. When beyond base needs being meet it seems to me strong bonds between humans (community, family friends ect.) is the best indicator of peoples actual happiness. Most richer societies have more isolating cultures that lead away from this. Why did they not just give this Index any other name?",

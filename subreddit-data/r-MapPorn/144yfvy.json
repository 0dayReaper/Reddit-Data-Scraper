As for Islam, sometime that sub is problematic because many of the commenters have fundamentalist tendencies but the question is am I posting or commenting something that indicates that I support Islamists? No I just have interests in learning about Islam, I also did a post on Hinduism subreddit and asked a question. \n\nAs for subreddit Pakistan, I\u2019m interested in Pakistani people views and the political climate there. Most seem chill and not a fan of islamism. So I don\u2019t understand. I remember posting it on Pakistan subreddit and I asked about the Balti people. \n\nAs for Chutyapa, I saw it as suggested subreddit but I have never subscribed or even have any interest looking at that. I think it\u2019s your problem, I don\u2019t even know what this subreddit is about. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m a ex Muslim, and I usually don\u2019t want to call myself that because I don\u2019t want to make that as my whole personality. \n\nNow that I checked your profile, you seemed to have deleted your posts on IndianSpeaks subreddit.

If I say anything that runs contrary to BJP, I\u2019m going to get banned. Just like when I was banned in Israel subreddit when I debated someone. Like literally, in order for me to feel accepted in the Israel subreddit community, I must support Zionism.  \n\nSo the subreddit IndianSpeaks isn\u2019t just a few extremist, almost all of them are extremist, it is a subreddit full of BJP supporters. Sure not all BJP are extremists especially those who are just voters but aren\u2019t politically minded or active but IndianSpeaks is politically active and it is full of BJP supporters.\n\nAs for my username, I do regret it, now they think I\u2019m just a Islamist wannabe or Turkic nationalist wannabe but I only put that username because I discovered a fascination of various Turkic languages plus I put warrior because Turks aren\u2019t known to be great warriors. That\u2019s it. \n\nI\u2019m no nationalist, I\u2019m no Islamists. I\u2019m a leftie, who supports secularism and yes I did leave Islam.

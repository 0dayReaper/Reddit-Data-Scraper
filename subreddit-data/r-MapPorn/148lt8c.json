Czech Rakousko and Slovak Rak\u00fasko neither derived from German \u00d6sterreich nor from Latin Austria. The Czech name of Rakousko, previously also Rak\u00fasy and later Rakousy, which is still used for the states of Upper and Lower Austria (Horn\u00ed, Doln\u00ed Rakousy), originates in the name of the Austrian castle and town of Raabs an der Thaya near the Czech-Austrian border, formerly also known as Ratgoz or Ratgos. It is worth noting that in his Geography the ancient writer Ptolemy mentions two tribes (of unknown ethnic affiliation) named Racatae and Racatriae which inhabit the areas around the Danube River \"up to his bend\", roughly corresponding to the region north of Vienna and southwestern Slovakia.",

Why don't we simply appreciate that the map maker adds extra information? More data is more better. \n\nThe real error is that the map shows United Kingdom in such a position that it makes it appears to refer to the Faroe Islands.",

That doesn't remove bordering countries, so if they are depicted, why not show their names and capital too. The more there is to be learnt!\n\nIf the title were written on the map itself you could have a point, but it isn't. It's as if I posted a picture of a zebra and wrote \"giraffe\" above it. That doesn't make the zebra faulted.\n\nTl;dr the fun is the raw data, not the selection by a label inserted in Reddit.",

Felt weird commenting on the big differences in day length and how pronounced the seasons are when Australia is so huge - but flipped, the majority of the population lives about as far away from the equator as India and Morocco. \n\nI went and flipped a map in photoshop (looking for other comparisons) and accidentally discovered why this is so suprising - most world maps aren't centre aligned on the equator and cut off the bit filled by Antarctica. So visually, Australia looks further south than it is.",

A lot will just show bits of Antarctica because it's not interesting to have a big empty blob, especially Mercator. This makes Australia appear relatively more southern than countries on the other side. Two is the general lack of landmass in the southern hemisphere, only about 1/3 of the world's landmass, and Australia is a large chunk of that. \n\nThird could be associative. For those of us in the northern hemisphere, going south means \"warmer.\" And north is \"colder.\" We know Australia is hot, which aligns with South. India is not cold, it does not align with North. Still for me this is something that still seems crazy when I consider the southern tip of South America. South America should be tropical and warm. Rain forest and all that. Same kind of thing when you go to New York State in the north and it's all green mountains and trees and no people. \"This isn't New York!\" because you're so used to the association New York = Megacity.",

Hindi and Tamil are probably as far apart as Italian and Russian if not more, and even relatively closer languages like Tamil and Telugu aren't very mutually intelligible.\n\nOf course the biggest problem is that each language has its own entire script system with 14 vowels and 50 consonants (more or less), because they're all very phonetically precise. Which is why in some ways it's nice to have English as a common language\n\nSource: I had to learn to speak, read and write Telugu (my mother tongue), Tamil (the language spoken in my state), Hindi (because it was compulsory) and English (also compulsory) by the age of 10. Maybe in a place like the US it would seem crazy but in India it's basic survival to learn such wildly different languages at a young age",

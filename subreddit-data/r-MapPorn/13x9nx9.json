[C of E is the biggest share, Islam the smallest (13.7% vs 6.7%)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_Kingdom). The stats for weekly attendance imply that the C of E numbers are ~600,000 (less than 1% of the population) https://www.statista.com/statistics/369080/church-of-england-attendance-by-service-uk/ i.e., that about 1 in 15 of those who identify as C of E go to weekly services. Even allowing for vastly higher attendances in the other religions you're still not going to get above 5% of the population going to weekly services.",

What \"regularly\" stands for is unfortunately unclear, so it could also be enough to go to church once a month or quarter. The figures are from 2019, so restrictions by Corona are not included.\n\nIn Germany, the Catholic Church and the Protestant Church are the same size. Interestingly, the Catholic Church seems to interpret \"regular\" far more broadly, as it says 9.1% of its members still practice the faith regularly. The Protestant church speaks of only 3.3% of its members.\n\nHere is my German source: https://fowid.de/meldung/religionszugehoerigkeiten-2019",

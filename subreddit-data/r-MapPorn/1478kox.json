For example, if you see \"IE\" that is a person from Ireland.  Notice that people from the same country tend to cluster near each other.  This is because they are more related.\n\nThe larger circles represent the average for each country.  This is clearest with Turkey, in the bottom right.  The circle is right in the middle of the four Turks.\n\nHere are some conclusions that we can draw from the map:\n\nThe graph and the map are similar, meaning that adjacent countries tend to be more related to each other than distant countries.  You can also see which geographic barriers, such as the mountains between Iberia and the rest of Western Europe, formed meaningful barriers to gene flow.\n\nPC1 aligns with the North-South axis, so North-South variation is larger than East-West variation.\n\nItalians come in different types.  One group (which I believe to be Sardinians, based on other information) are particularly divergent.",

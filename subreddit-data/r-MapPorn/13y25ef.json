                    "comment": "I'm actually fairly pro-abortion and don't much care about fetuses (feti?) AND cognizant of flaws in the criminal trial process, yet somehow can recognize a distinction between killing unborn innocent humans (presuming one considers them humans, they are certainly innocent) mostly for reasons of personal social or economic life goals, and killing adult guilty humans for actual crimes following a trial. \n\nHeck, they even keep the convicted around for decades and through extremely prolonged appeal processes and open also to challenge by independent activist groups, all at public expense, before actually getting around to executing them. Far longer than was the case a century ago, or was the case right until the end in countries like the UK which formerly practiced capital punishment (often mere months). \n\nEven with all the flaws, and while they put a decent number of people on death row innocent of the particular crime for which they have been sentenced, rare indeed they seem to get around to actually executing someone innocent of said crime. If ever. Whenever I check in on this kind of news, usually someone has been executed who might have been legitimately released on a process violation made by cops or DAs which, I repeat, is a legitimate part of the judicial system, but who is usually still understood guilty of the charged crime. That can be chalked up to a failure, but it's not a moral problem. Rarer, someone is executed who might really be innocent of the charged crime, but has committed plenty of others as serious. That's both a process failure AND a moral one, but still not much of the latter. An actual innocent person who didn't commit the capital offense convicted or any other crime remotely as bad, let alone never committed any crime at all, and still not only gets convicted but actually executed, would be the gold standard.\n\nNone of which, of course, means a person can't take a firm stance that capital punishment is wrong in toto, but it still wouldn't really be comparable to abortion. I don't get that at all.",

Given how Arizona and Georgia have been changing over the last five years, I would expect the death penalty to no longer be used there in the near future (I hope).  \n\nOf course, the usual suspects are the states with the most backward policy approaches. Strange enough, many of these states are also some of the most religious \"Christian\" states. Funny how states with lots of fundamentalists and \"anti-government\" folks are okay with state-sanctioned death penalties.",

Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's. \n\nCaesar certainly did practice capital punishment. Lots of it. As a rule, the Romans thought prolonged imprisonment to be the crueler punishment. They'd probably endorse those states executing people AND using penal labour, but not long sentences in solitary.",

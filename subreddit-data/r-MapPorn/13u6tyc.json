Did we ever invade their territory? Did we coup their governments? Did their presidents work for our intelligence agency? Do we support a internal conflict in Mexico by dealing with their drug cartels in their country? \n\nEven France and England are more enemies of Mexico than we are.\n\nThis is the same old divide-and-conquer strategy the Anglo-Saxon world has used to dominate the Hispanic world, just like all the Black Legend propaganda they push on the Anglophilic and Francophilic elites of our countries. \n\nThe Anglo-Saxon Protestant world will pay with their medicine. Just like the person that sells their soul to Dracula for immortality, eventually they will suffer the same fate of their victims. \n\nOur Two Centuries of Humiliation will end with the unity of the Iberophone peoples.",

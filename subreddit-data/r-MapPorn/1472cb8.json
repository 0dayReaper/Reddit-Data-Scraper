Hence why the data might be a little skewed, a lot of daily border crossing going on there and no hard border enforcement.",

The borders are very loose with no customs or check points, but the cities do feel separate. Rivera is just one big city with half being in Uruguay and half being in Brazil. The border is just a street.",

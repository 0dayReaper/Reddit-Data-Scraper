Anywhere in the country could get fresh that day fish if there was simply more cultural interest and demand for it. 50-66% of fish landed in the UK is exported.\n\nI think the reason may be that in prior generations fish was seen as cheap, (jellied eel, kippers) and so people today have cultural preferences for meat like beef because it is seen as fancy. A lot of fish consumption is still \"cheap\" meals like fish and chips rather than more staple meals.",

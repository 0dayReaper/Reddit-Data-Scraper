The Shiites and sunni's never held strong political power in Lebanon specifically but in neighboring Damascus and Palestinian areas yes, look up fahkreddin and so on even pasha al atrash in the 1920s fighting against france",

The names were not related.\n\nThe city in Libya was originally named Oea and was part of a group of Phoenician colonies (with Sabratha and Leptis Magna) called the three cities, Tripolis. At some point in the late Roman period the name Tripoli became ascribed to just one of the three cities, and the other two eventually fell into ruins.\n\nWhereas Tripoli in Lebanon was so named because it was a single city settled by colonists from three different other Phoenician cities.",

There's a decent argument to be made about where it's even a form of Islam, kinda like Mormonism and Christianity. \n\nThey believe that God consists of a divine Trinity of three different aspects, each of which has been re-incarnated multiple times in human form 7 times, with the latest incarnations of them being Muhammad, Ali (the fourth Caliph, cousin and son-in-law and companion to Muhammad), and Salman the Persian (companion of Muhammad). They celebrate a mass with consecrated bread and wine. Some believe in human reincarnation. They celebrate Christmas, Epiphany, and the feast days of John Chrysostom (early Christian church father) and Mary Magdalene. They seem to have holy writings other than the Quran (\"seem to\", because they keep them secret).",

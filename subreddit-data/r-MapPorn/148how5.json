So it makes sense that some things are inaccurate (such as Florida's coastline) if it's based on what people back in the 1740's might have thought.  But for all the research that went into creating it, they included some things such as Fort Duquesne (modern-day Pittsburgh, PA) and Fort Cumberland (modern-day Cumberland, MD) which didn't exist yet in 1746.  They were both built in 1754.",

It was probably not he who drew the map each time, which is also copied from a dozen different plates. It is therefore possible that locations that did not yet exist appeared with an earlier dated map, and that the names were a phonetic approximation into French from their original languages. Even the locations may be approximate, since it was not usual for a Frenchman to visit the British colonies at that time.",

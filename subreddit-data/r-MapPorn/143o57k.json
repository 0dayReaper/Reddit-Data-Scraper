Oil production represents 60 percent of government revenues.\n\nEquatorial Guinea (The World Factbook) has a GDP per capita of $25 700 (2013), proven oil reserves of 1.1 billion barrels and a population of 722 254. Oil production represents over 90 percent of government revenues and 98 percent of exports.\n\nEquatorial Guinea started oil production at a significant level in the late 1990s, while Gabon's started about twenty years earlier. Oil production in Gabon has dropped since its peak in 1997 due to aging oil fields.\n\nBoth countries suffer a very high income inequality, with many people remaining very poor. Their current wealth is in contrast with their less recent past, when the countries lacked almost everything.",

In Africa, it's true that Europeans drew borders without consideration for where various population groups lived. But in the Middle East, look at the borders of the Ottoman, Persian, Umayyad/Abbasid and Roman Empires. None of them were ever based around where various ethnic groups lived either. You'd probably have to go back to the Bronze Age to see a large variety of local kingdoms.",

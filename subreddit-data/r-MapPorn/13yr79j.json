Remember, there\u2019s a lot of super small counties and religious conservatives may have passed from Covid at 3x the rate of more socially liberal individuals.  Plus, those who are older are more relgious today in general.\n\nIt would take a lot of checking but I bet the whole chart country is lighter today.\n\nblue would also take over from purple in some cases, it\u2019s missing ten years of hispanic immigration.

Children through age 17 make up about 22% of the population.  it\u2019s as close to a usable ratio as we have.  Across the average of a group it\u2019s probably correct to within a few percent.  Let\u2019s round down to 20% to make children a smaller percent of the faith\n\nso children of record are half of 20% of members\n\n89,000 \\*10 is 890,000 members.  Now, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true today what it shows is child bearing membership is either\n\n1. gone\n2. not having kids\n\nWith a claimed 17 million membership there should be 1.7 million children of record for the faith and 3.4 million total to be maintaining its numbers.  That\u2019s the needed replacement value.\n\nthose youth numbers are 19x lower than expected\n\none can argue there\u2019s all these children not being recorded, but that\u2019s telling too.  Can you imagine most your families not being enough into the faith to tell them the names of their kids?\n\nthere\u2019s isolated signs out of wards and stakes that attendance is about 20-30% what their listed membership is per location.\n\n3.4-5.1 million would be a lot closer to 178,000 children.  That feels much more realistic, especially if top heavy on older members.\n\n3.4 million would still imply 340k children of record but being 3-4x off seems like a likely birthrate drop off within the faith,  families didn\u2019t suddenly have 19x fewer children but moving from 6 to 2 kids would be and I doubt 18 in 19 members of childbearing quitting is reality, but those who remain still having big families but 2 in 3 quitting before having kids makes more sense.\n\nYou have to assume their total membership is a big fat lie for their numbers to be realistic.",

Sure, more children for the one man in a polygamous relationship, but more children are born in total (by a large margin) if all of the women would have had a monogamous husband. Ironically, the church would have grown faster if polygamy hadn\u2019t ever been a thing. You\u2019re correct though that immigration was a huge driver of church population growth in the 1800\u2019s\u2026especially expanding into Idaho, Nevada, and Arizona",

Being far from any coast and the land being poor, Utah was a pretty terrible place to settle with the state of technology at the time, but it was all that was left. The US government allowed it, until it realized that it actually DID want Utah after all, and so banned polygamy and absorbed the area. However, they were already settled there.",

There have been so many ebbs and flows in how religion looks like in America. \n\nTo illustrate this, consider that the North-East was also the centre of the Enlightenment. When America was founded, Christianity had experienced a significant decline in America. The states with the highest church membership amongst colonists were New Hampshire and South Carolina at just 6%, the lowest was North Carolina at 4%. Today, 4/5ths of North Carolina are associated with a church, and 75% have a church they go to. \n\nFour of the early presidents were Unitarian's, who do not believe in the divinity of Christ. Harvard was Unitarian. Thomas Jefferson was sort of Unitarian too. \n\nWashington, Jefferson, Franklin, Madison and Monroe were all Deists, which is sort of belief in the supreme being and reason and rejecting the Bible. \n\nAlso the main answer is that South = African American's, English and Scottish protestants and the North has a lot of Irish, Italian, Portuguese, Hispanic and French immigrants",

Only 1% (1 person) in the senate despite being about 23-26%~ of the population. But we can even make it better there is only ONE person in congress that is an Atheist, that's 0.2% despite 1/4th of the population being Atheist.\n\nEDIT: I used Atheism as a collective for everyone non-affiliated and could've worded that better (English isn't my native language so bare with me). I call myself Atheist but i'm more Agnostic and this post was just to show that the percentages are very off. Even if we replace \"Atheist\" with \"non-affiliated\" we still have a 24.8% gap, why aren't those people represented?",

[https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/4/13/15258496/american-atheists-how-many](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/4/13/15258496/american-atheists-how-many)\n\n&gt;First is the Pew Research Center. Most recently, Pew found that around 3 percent of Americans say they are atheists. It also found that a larger group \u2014 around 9 percent \u2014 say they do not believe in God or a universal spirit. (Which goes to show that you may not believe in God but could still be uncomfortable calling yourself an atheist \u2014 because that term implies a strong personal identity and an outright rejection of religious rituals.)\n\nAll of those 9% are atheists, they just didn't want to call themselves atheists.\n\n&gt;So if you can\u2019t ask people outright whether they\u2019re atheist and get an honest response, how do you go about finding them?\r  \n\r  \nGervais and Najle set up a very subtle test. They sent a nationally representative poll to 2,000 Americans, who were randomly assigned to two conditions.\r  \n\r  \nThe first condition asked participants to read through a bunch of statements like, \u201cI am a vegetarian,\u201d \u201cI own a dog,\u201d and, \u201cI have a dishwasher in my kitchen.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nAll the participants had to do was simply write down the number of statements that were true for them.\r  \n\r  \nThe value of this method is that participants don\u2019t have to directly say, \u201cI am a vegetarian,\u201d or, \u201cI\u2019m a dog owner\u201d \u2014 they only have to acknowledge the number of statements that apply to them. That alone should zero out any embarrassment or hesitance to admit to a particular item.\r  \n\r  \nThat\u2019s important because the other 1,000 or so participants saw the exact same list \u2014 but with one statement added: \u201cI believe in God.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nBy comparing the responses between the two groups, Gervais and Najle could then estimate how many people don\u2019t believe in God. (Because both groups of 1,000 poll takers should, in theory, have the same number of vegetarians, dog owners, and so on in each group, any increases in the number of agreed-to statements from the first group to the second should be reflective of the number of people who don\u2019t believe in God.)\r  \n\r  \nOne thing is clear from the results: Much more than 10 or 11 percent of the country (as assessed in Gallup and Pew polling) does not believe in God. \u201cWe can say with a 99 percent probability that it\u2019s higher than \\[11 percent\\],\u201d said Gervais.\r  \n\r  \nHis best estimate: Around 26 percent of Americans don\u2019t believe in God. \u201cAccording to our samples, about 1 in 3 atheists in our country don't feel comfortable disclosing their lack of belief,\u201d Najle explains in an email.\n\nSo, 26%, or around 1 in 4 Americans are atheists. Even with the margin of error, the result is far more than 9%.",

There\u2019s also those with no explicit religious creed but still a belief in the supernatural/some form of higher power, who would answer \u201cnone\u201d if handed a list of religions but definitely aren\u2019t atheists. \n\nThe *nones* do occupy a fairly surprising and growing population chunk, but atheists at 25% does not sound correct to me either. If it were correct, then given the religious leanings of most of the Republican Party\u2019s followers something around half of the Democrats would be atheists, which would be a *massive* influence on secularism (in the sense of the French concept) at the city/county/state level.

Some use of the term as you described, but if that's not explicitly clear from the context it's probably best to assume the broader definition.  For one example, I prefer the term atheist even though I'm more of an agnostic by your stated definitions.\n\nLikewise, agnostic doesn't just mean a person who is in the fence, it also refers to anyone who believes that its impossible to know if God exists.  By that definition, a lot of religious people  would also be agnostic and simply say that they have faith in God even if we can't know anything about his existence or nature.",

I'm British so not knowledgeable on specific state constitutions but Catholicism which was the principle religious exclusion in Britain at the time was removed as a barrier for voting and office in 1829 with the Emancipation Act. Other Protestant denominations that met the property requirements to stand office and vote had been free to do so since the 1680's and the start of several Toleration Acts.\n\nThe British can't talk about not having weird old laws on our books. Apparently I can go to Chester near the Welsh border and shoot a Welshman with a bow and arrow and I'm all good so make of it what you will.",

There's like 3 states listed as being illegal to put ice cream in your back pocket. I don't believe there are actually 3 states with that law. I don't believe there's any. I am willing to believe that there's some old case in some state where someone did it to steal a horse or whatever, the story got telephone gamed into \"its illegal to put ice cream in your back pocket\", instead of \"its illegal to steal horses even if you use a silly method\". Then authors of \"silly law books\" in the 20th century wrote that shit down. And it's been regurgitated as truth ever since.\n\nI've looked into other silly laws, like the beating your wife in front of a court house on Sundays in certain cities, and there's absolutely zero evidence of them in the city code, the state code, online case law, or anything like that. So odds are high that they're at best, wildly distorted claims.\n\nYou're right about unconstitutional laws though, especially if politically charged. Easier to let them be than raise the ire of a loud and obnoxious interest group",

Asked for the words to be stricken through/lined out and all parties to date and initial it or I wasn\u2019t closing that day. I was told no, no alteration to text deed was permitted, and that the seller could sue me for failure to close. I said fine. Called our family friend friend, an attorney, and asked for advice on how to proceed. He said strike through the text, leaving it still visible behind the lines struck through the text, then everyone dates and initials that change and it\u2019s all good. \n\nRealtor and title settlement  rep both said not everyone sees it, some who do remark on it, but nobody ever asks for it to be removed.

It's called the \"supreme law of the land\" for a reason, it defines itself as such via the Supremacy Clause.\n\nThe 10th Amendment states \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" This (a religious test for public office) is a power prohibited by the Constitution to the states. In fact, anything actually in the Constitution bypasses the 10th Amendment.\n\nThe 10th Amendment really doesn't do much, it's too vague. Basically it's just a catchall for things the Constitution didn't predict, so if the Constitution doesn't mention something the federal government can't do it (which actually covers very little because it turns out it's very easy to justify almost any national policy with the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause), and if the Constitution doesn't ban states from doing something or grant that power to the federal government, then the power reverts to either states or the people.",

Even if those rights should win out in the end.  \n\nOr even more indirectly, atheists growing up in these states may move to more welcoming states after realizing there are explicit laws discriminating against them/their friends/their families.

There is a specific constitutional protection for persons of any faith to not be barred from public office on account of their faith.

No person who acknowledges the being of a God and a future state of rewards and punishments shall, on account of his religious sentiments, be disqualified to hold any office or place of trust or profit under this Commonwealth. \n\nAlso, the PA constitution protects any one from being compelled to support a religion or worship against their will.\n\n\u00a7 3. Religious freedom. All men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences; no man can of right be compelled to attend, erect or support any place of worship, or to maintain any ministry against his consent; no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience, and no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishments or modes of worship. \n\n[PA Commonwealth Constitution ](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/CT/HTM/00/00.HTM)",

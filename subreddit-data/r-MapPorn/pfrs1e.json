Anything to help the former Yugoslavia.\n\n**Clinton Deploys Vowels to Bosnia**\n\n(originally appeared in The Onion, Number One In News)\n\n**Cities of Sjlbvdnzv, Grzny to Be First Recipients**\n\nBefore an emergency joint session of Congress yesterday, President Clinton announced US plans to deploy over 75,000 vowels to the war-torn region of Bosnia. The deployment, the largest of its kind in American history, will provide the region with the critically needed letters A,E,I,O and U, and is hoped to render countless Bosnian names more pronounceable.\n\n\"For six years, we have stood by while names like Ygrjvslhv and Tzlynhr and Glrm have been horribly butchered by millions around the world,\" Clinton said. \"Today, the United States must finally stand up and say 'Enough.' It is time the people of Bosnia finally had some vowels in their incomprehensible words. The US is proud to lead the crusade in this noble endeavour.\"\n\nThe deployment, dubbed Operation Vowel Storm by the State Department, is set for early next week, with the Adriatic port cities of Sjlbvdnzv and Grzny slated to be the first recipients. Two C-130 transport planes, each carrying over 500 24-count boxes of \"E's,\" will fly from Andrews Air Force Base across the Atlantic and airdrop the letters over the cities.\n\nCitizens of Grzny and Sjlbvdnzv eagerly await the arrival of the vowels. \"My God, I do not think we can last another day,\" Trszg Grzdnjkln, 44, said. \"I have six children and none of them has a name that is understandable to me or to anyone else. Mr. Clinton, please send my poor, wretched family just one 'E.' Please.\"\n\nSaid Sjlbvdnzv resident Grg Hmphrs, 67: \"With just a few key letters, I could be George Humphries. This is my dream.\"\n\nThe airdrop represents the largest deployment of any letter to a foreign country since 1984. During the summer of that year, the US shipped 92,000 consonants to Ethiopia, providing cities like Ouaouoaua, Eaoiiuae, and Aao with vital, life-giving supplies of L's, S's and T's.\n\nhttps://64.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l4fol69tKY1qaajseo1_500.gifv",

The Actual religion is Sanatan Dharma. There are many categories of Is ldol worshipping people even now in India who do not suscribe to any philosophy, Ritual or practice  of Sanatan Dharma they also call themselves Hindu .\n\nThe Sanatan Dharma had an name based on myth or part myth and part history of a king called Bharat. And the land or people he commanded as Bharatvarshi.\n\nDuring the writing of constitution the communal characterstics of Sanatan Dharma majority got the name of Bharat in the constitution .\nIt's named as ' Bharat that is India'.  Though the cultural name of Hindustan remains popular probably more popular than Bharat. However official name is India and Bharat. Both can be used interchangeably\n Its usage is india in English and bharat in hindi. We have 16 other national languages they at times use India or Bharat in official documents. However the most popular name is India..\n \n.",

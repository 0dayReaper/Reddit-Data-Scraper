In some cases for the name of a country  they take the demonym of the country and write it according to their own pronunciation: Spain: Spanyol (from Spanish \u201cEspa\u00f1ol\u201d, Spaniard). England: Inggris (from English \u201cEnglish\u201d), and France: Perancis (from French \u201cFran\u00e7ais\u201d,  French). but it seems, like in Philippines\u2019 Tagalog, Bahasa Indonesian originally lacked the sound /f/, only present in loanwords, and it tends to be pronounced as /p/ (Fran\u00e7ais= Ferancis = Perancis)\nNot in other cases, such Finlandia, that probably entered the language much later (contact with colonial powers)",

Yes.\n* Did Poland had any terrain advantage, technological or economical superiority, larger population than its adversaries? No.\n* Did Poland fought them regardless and bravely? Yes.\n* Did Poland lose as expected? Yes.\n* Was it possible to change the result of the war by any means like applying a different military strategy? No.\n* Was it extremely costly to Poland that they lost half of its territories in the East, most of its ability to resist in Katyn massacre, as well as the destruction of its infrastructure? Yes.\n* Did the Polish resistance to invasion cost more damage to Poland during and after the occupation, in contrast to capitulated nations like Czechoslovakia? Yes.\n* Could Poland suffer from less if they played it like Czechs, and save more of their people, lands etc? Yes.\n\nWe all like and admire the heroic stories of the Polish Cavalry fighting against Nazi tanks but in the end Poland lost half of its territories, most of its intelligencia, and became a \"vassal\" state to the Soviets for 44 years.",

The Polish cavalry charging tanks with sabers and lances was a propaganda created by the Nazis, and it was **fake**. Germans wanted to present  Poles as stupid people, and themselves as superior.\n\nHowever, the main anti-tank unit of the Polish Army was its cavalry equipped with 35mm anti-tank rifles. Actually, it was a good hit and run strategy but 35mm rifles were not good enough to penetrate the new German tanks. \n\nHere is a picture of one anti-tank cavalry:\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Polski\\_u%C5%82an\\_z\\_karabinem\\_przeciwpancernym\\_UR.jpg",

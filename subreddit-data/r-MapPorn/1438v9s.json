                    "comment": "In this timeline the last Jagellon on Czech throne wasn't killed and Kingdom of Bohemia created union with Poland... Later when Ottomans invaded Hungary, Slovaks rebelled against Hungarians and and together with Ottomans defeated Hungarian King. Slovaks were the first in Budapest while Austria annexed some western portions of the country including Croatian and Slovene part of the country...\n\nLater when the German question was being solved they chose the Gro\u00dfdeutsche L\u00f6sung instead of the Kleindeutsche L\u00f6sung favored irl and Germany was unified, including Austria, because of this the German Empire was more decentralised and thus became a democracy granting Slovenia and Croatia their independence. \n\nLater, war broke out between Ottomans and Commonwealth (Czechia, Slovakia, Baltics including Prussia and Kashubia, Poland, Ukraine and Belarus). Ottomans were followed by Italy, Occitania and Spain and the commonwealth was followed by Germany. By this time Ottoman empire was unstable and rebellions broke out in the Balkans so they promised Crimea to Ukraine in exchange for backstabbing the commonwealth...\n\nUkraine accepted and swiftly conquered Belarus, but this was the last won battle for the Mediterranean league. In the next few years the Ottoman empire falls into bloody civil war while Occitania already surrendered and Spain and Italy was about to lose as well...\n\nThe peace finally come and nations were granted the right of self determination. Brittany was granted independence from Occitania. Catalonia, Basque country and Galicia seceded from Spain. South Tyrol was annexed by Germany and Dalmatia and Istria were annexed to Croatia and Slovenia. Ruthenia was granted independence from Ukraine and some western parts were annexed to Poland. Armenia, Greece, Bulgaria, Albania, Montenegro, FR of Northern Caucasus, Serbia, Montenegro and finally Romania got their independence too. By this time it was almost 500 yrs since the defeat of Hungary a because Hungarians were split between 3 powers they got mostly assimilated to the respective majorities in that or surrounding area.",

Later Dutch arrived and alongside them Frisians who colonized big part of the east coast including England. England (mostly Celtic) later in the 19th century declared independence and because Dutch weren't able to defeat them and English didn't wanted that many Dutch people in their state, because of fear of losing newly gained independence, they agreed to settle borders where they're. (This kind of refers to today's Ireland where the north is owned by UK) and rest is independent. In this timeline Dutch are the dominant world power.",

In 1841 a Russian army engineer wrote a paper stating that such a danger did not exist since railways could be made dysfunctional by retreating or diverting forces. Also the construction of the Warsaw\u2013Vienna railway in 1,435 mm (4 ft 8 1\u20442 in) was precisely so it could be connected to the Western European network, in that case to reduce Poland's dependence on Prussia for transport. Finally for the Moscow \u2013 Saint Petersburg Railway, which became the benchmark, the choice of track gauge was between 5 ft (1,524 mm) and the wider 6 ft (1,829 mm), not standard gauge 1,435 mm (4 ft 8 1\u20442 in). However, it was just not selected with that in mind. When a railway has wooden sleepers, it is fairly easy to make the gauge narrower by removing the nails and placing them back at a narrower position, something Germany did during WWII. Destroying river bridges had a larger effect.",

I also took a night train north to south in Thailand, and that was dirt cheap as well.\n\nBut granted, when it comes to covering massive distances spanning all of Eurasia, surely, one expensive plane flight is probably cheaper than all the accumulated cheap train fares.",

We also get some incredibly \"cheap\" train services for certain routes and certain times, like a Paris-Bordeaux for 18 euros, but only at particularly less-convenient times. Still pretty good. And I think it's thanks to the fact that our trains are subsidized by the government to make them cheaper.",

I get there at 2:40. Wait and find out Train doesn\u2019t depart until 5:30. Fuck. I\u2019m tired out of my mind since I had just gotten off a cross pacific flight. Train boards at 4:30. Customs check. Sit on train for an hour waiting for it to depart. Hear these Germans complaining in the booth over. Finally the train departs. We\u2019re going! After 10 minutes it stops. Freight traffic. 20 minute wait. Ok, it\u2019s going again. Then the train legit stops on the border while border agents walk across a field to the tracks to do a passport check in each car. Takes about 15 minutes. Train gets going again, it\u2019s pretty slow but whatever, the scenery is nice. Finally at 10:00pm we arrive in Seattle. The ticket stated we would arrive at 6:30. Never doing that again.",

But then it looked like I'd miss the next possible connection an hour later, also the ac broke. Accepted that and it went on and on until we eventually stopped 1 station before mine. Even if we had gotten that far there wouldn't have been a connection until the day after. The train stopped not at the station but like 10 meters before that and it was hot (was this summer). We eventually reached the next station got out and had to wait for a few trains before we could take one that wasn't overcrowded. When I finally arrived at the station where I had to take my connection it was 3 am. Still 1 1/2 hours away from home, nocturnal buddy was there to pick me up luckily.\n\nSecond time this happened. Miss my most frequent connection 4/5 times and have to wait an hour on the next bus. No mobility warranty for delays that occur during the train ride. Only for those you know about before.

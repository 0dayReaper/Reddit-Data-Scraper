(They were granted full citizenship in 1917.) Puerto Ricans pay taxes to the federal government and can participate in the presidential primary process. \n\nShould Puerto Rico become the 51st US state, or should it remain a territory of the US? \n\nThe 2020 referendum was the sixth time that Puerto Rico held such a referendum on the status of Puerto Rico.",

Any Puerto Rican nationalists will probably dislike this for instance. They\u2019d likely have to adopt English more in general, and it\u2019s possible the native population will be made second class citizens, like what happened to Hawaii.\n\nHonestly tho, I don\u2019t think the current situation is working. We should either have them (and our other territories) join as states or make them independent. It seems odd to have this weird middle ground that pleases no one.",

But I do remember that during one of these votes that wasn\u2019t that long ago IIRC many who were against statehood ended up abstaining from the vote entirely. So if you look at the actual number of votes for whichever that vote was, it\u2019s drastically lower than other votes. It was a widespread protest. I forget exactly why tho. But even without that, this is pretty close. N I believe that this wasn\u2019t like an official vote, but the gov did it more so to gauge the public. And if this wasn\u2019t the one w the protest then it\u2019s a p close call, so I could see them waiting for a tiny bit more public support. The us really isn\u2019t against giving them statehood. It\u2019s not the gov that\u2019s preventing them. It\u2019s really that they themselves haven\u2019t been to interested in becoming a state",

Culturally, really, they are a separate nation that happened to fall into the US orbit because of the Spanish -American War and never went independent during decolonization. While the USA would survive adding such an alien state, I don't know if it is a good fit.",

You actually support independence and becoming a state makes that even harder (see the US Civil War for what happens when states try to leave).\n2. You lose a number of tax advantages and have to pay more federal taxes. Some argue it would also lose current federal aid subsidies, but that is less clear and more likely a scare story.\n\nThe main reason for getting statehood is actually getting proper representation in Congress and a say in presidential elections, and the federal government losing the right to be able to veto laws passed by the local legislature.",

However, they would pay more taxes overall since states collect a separate tax\n\nEdit: this is actually a lot more confusing than I thought. They pay most federal taxes, but not federal income tax, but only for income made in Puerto Rico. This is due to the 1917 Jones-Shafroth Act, which granted Puerto-Ricans citizenship, but also this weird tax status. The reason for the tax exemption was to attract businesses to Puerto Rico\n\nSo they do pay federal tax, just less than the average American in a state. However, the exemption isn\u2019t due to them not being a state, but rather a special rule for them. I couldn\u2019t find anything saying whether or not this exemption would end upon statehood (I would assume it would)",

If it were an independent nation, it\u2019d be as poor and underdeveloped as the rest of the surrounding islands. As an American state, it can access more funds than any of its neighbors and considerably improve their living standards. But of course, the ultime decision depends on the US Congress, not the people of PR",

While it is not good for you, it is virtually impossible to expose yourself to  levels of it from firing ranges that will affect your health at all. But I think people overreact when they hear the word \"uranium,\" like depleted uranium shells is the equivalent of Hiroshima or something.

Or should the US change its constitution to allow territories to have a say in the federal government?",

PR has over 127 BILLION in outstanding public debt for less than 3 million people.\n\nSo 10%+ of PR has moved to the states and more come every day.  \n\nIts a downward spiral and will require an act of congress to resolve it, but don't expect congress to act.",

Some Hawaiians may be annoyed by crowds of tourists getting in their way, hotels being built along the beach, or just be bigoted against outsiders, but its hard to say that tourism is a net loss to the people of the state.\n\nPuerto Rico is already economically integrated into the US as if they were a state, there are few barriers to investment that would go away with statehood, if anything, the certain exemptions from US taxes that they currently enjoy are an encouragement to open hotels there. The ability to move freely back and forth has actually resulted in mass emigration from the island, the population has declined by half a million people since peaking in the early 2000s. If anything, the island would benefit from wealthier mainlanders moving there and increasing their declining tax base.",

We further recognize the historic significance of the 2012 local referendum in which a 54 percent majority voted to end Puerto Rico's current status as a U.S. territory, and 61 percent chose statehood over options for sovereign nationhood. We support the federally sponsored political status referendum authorized and funded by an Act of Congress in 2014 to ascertain the aspirations of the people of Puerto Rico. Once the 2012local vote for statehood is ratified, Congress should approve an enabling act with terms for Puerto Rico's future admission as the 51ststate of the Union.\"\n\nSo yeah Cons, if you support Trump, you support PR becoming a state.\n\nMaybe you should have read what you were signing up for, hmm?",

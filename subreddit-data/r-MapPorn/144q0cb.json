You are a bigot who is celebrating an empire on par with the Japanese and German ones, one which has committed countless genocides and massacres, deliberately starved dozens of millions in avoidable famines by pumping out food to your own wars, destroyed entire regions of the world for your own shit.\n\nFortunately you are now an insignificant island with an economy decreasing by the year and with active movements to split your country, take solace in that.\n\nYou will soon be uninteresting and completely insignificant on the global scale, to cope with this you are looking back upon an empire of pain and misery, an empire which can never come back but can still shrink as which it will continue to do.\n\nMaybe if you actually tried to contribute something to your country it's economy would reduce at a slightly slower place than it is now. Not to mention that your country headed by a man from one of your former colonies lmao).",

            "comment": "The autonomy was built in 1994 to preserve the gagauz culture and language and prevent a bloody separation like in 1992 with Russia backed Transnistria. After over 30 years it has become clear to anyone in R. Moldova that the purpose of the autonomy has failed miserably. People there stopped talking their own gagauz languge from their own free will, only used russian language in the day to day life and only taught russian to their kids. As a consequence they got heavily russified (more than before the autonomy was created), they only watch russian propaganda (they do not watch tv channels from R. Moldova, just from Russia), they support Putler and his invasion in Ukraine 100%, they consider themselves to be a different ''country'' part of the ruski mir. They are anti-Chisinau and anti-romanian, anti-EU, anti-US, anti-west in general.\n\nThey love to get significant funds from Romania, R. Moldova, EU, US, Turkey for roads, schools, kindergartens, etc. (its the region in R. Moldova that gets by far the most funds from the state and from foreign aids, the region has more rights and benefits than any other regions) but they simply take the money, then spit towards west and open their tv sets to watch Soloviev, Skabeeva or Simonyan and their toxic propaganda.",

                    "comment": "So the autonomy has failed based on the fact they made choices you don't like?  Most Irish have English as their first language a century after independence.  Clearly they've also failed beyond your ability to tolerate them.  Lol.  I hope these gagauz people realize they've crossed you before they get in big trouble.\n\n\n They prolly don't give two shs about your opinion on what TV shows they watch, what language they teach in their schools, or their feelings about the United States.  I feel you might be missing an essential distinction about where your business ends and theirs begins.  They could start teaching their kids swahili and worshipping the goddess kali if they want.  They're autonomous.  I don't think all cultures are equal, but as far as these \"these people love Russia too much - while on their own land\" - you might want to reflect on your chauvinism.  Gagauzia was created so they could pursue their own interests, even sending flower bouquets to putin if they feel like it.  Get off your high horse.\n\nEdit - 3 spelling errors",

Its administrative center is Comrat, a vibrant city known for its unique blend of Gagauz, Russian, and Moldovan influences.\n\nIf you like my work you can visit my website to see my other maps.",

You are really claiming that the gagauz and Bulgarians aren't natives on their territory?\n\n\nLol, I'm a hundred percent certain you're right there are no ukrainian plans to offer either group autonomy.  You only have to listen to ukrainian politicians comments regarding Crimea (with a russian majority who dont want to be ukrainian) to know they have no interest in ethnic minorities rights to decide their own future.",

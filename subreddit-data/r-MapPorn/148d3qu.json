The way trends were going, the Negev was going to be Jewish majority unless Jews were explicitly forbidden from moving in. Also from my understanding (Arab) Palestinian nationalism was more of a Fellaheen thing than a Bedouin thing, so there wasn\u2019t a strong compulsion to join either state. Even to this day Bedouins are the most likely group of Arabs within Israel to identify as Israeli Arabs, even if they don\u2019t identify particularly strongly with the state or nation and are frequently subject to state oppression.",

Also people who are conscripted have a military training, it's not like they draft some random people. They have had a some kind of military service when they've turned 18-19 and then they're set to reserve and ideally have re-training periods. You remain on reserve until 55-60 years old but of course soldiers who are at the frontline are usually in their twenties or thirties.\n\nA conscription army also doesn't mean that they're automatically worse than a professional army. I'm bit biased as a finnish person, but I'm pretty sure that average conscripted Finnish Defensive Force soldier (that something like 90% of finnish male are) are more well trained and perform better than average Russian professional soldier.",

While there were some massacres perpetrated by the Arabs (such as the Hadassah medical envoy's murder and the Haifa Oil Refinery massacre), overall, in Benny Morris' words, \"Arab armies committed few atrocities and no large-scale massacre of prisoners took place when circumstances might have allowed them to happen\".\n\nOne mustn't also forget the massacres of Arabs by the ~~IDF~~ Irgun (an Israeli paramilitary group), such as Deir Yassin. In total, around 800 Arab civilians in total were killed over the 10-month war. However, according to Benny Morris, the \"1948 [war] is noteworthy for the relatively small number of civilian casualties both in the battles themselves and in the atrocities that accompanied them\" in comparison, for example, \"with the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s or the Sudanese civil wars of the past fifty years\".\n\nEDIT: I should note that the rhetoric by the Arab leaders was certainly genocidal. For example, Azzam Pasha, the Secretary-General of the Arab League, [said](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azzam_Pasha_quotation) in 1947 that \"I personally wish that the Jews do not drive us to this war, as this will be a war of extermination and a momentous massacre which will be spoken of like the Mongolian massacres and the Crusades.\"",

Most of the people who left were the wealthier ones who could afford to relocate leaving the remaining Arab Palestinian population without much if its civilian wealth. \n\n2 ) The war began because  the Arab League didn't agree with the plan and attacked the Jews in Mandatory Palestine as the British left. War breeds crisis. \n\n3) Jordanian and Egyptian propaganda made Arab Palestinians flee all Jewish forces even when it was not necessary. Most famously the mayor of Haifa begged his Arab citizens to stay but they left fearing the Haganah  \n\n\n**They also claimed that the Haganah was involved in Deir Yessin which was on the Irgun and Lehi but was not perpetrated by the far larger Haganah. That's also on Israel not dealing with extremists until after the war ended. (nor today apparently since Ben-Gvir exists but that's a rant for a different post)** \n\n\n4) The Arab armies were so assured of victory many Arab Palestinians left their homes assuming they'd come back after the Jews were gone. When the Israelis won (ish) they were made refugees overnight \n\n5) Which leads to #5 where the Arab States demanded Israel take in Palestinian refugees (in addition to Jewish refugees from Europe and Arab states) despite starting the war. Israel refused and the Arab states didn't deal with the crisis then and continues to prolong it even today. \n\n\nIn my opinion: 6) International support for Hamas and Hezbollah allows them to stay in power longer. But the longer Hamas controls Gaza and other terror groups exist there is further Palestinians will be from an independent state since nobody wants to give terror groups more power and Israel will never compromise its security for chance at Palestinian statehood. At least not again.",

In June of 1948 ( 75 years almost to the day) the Irgun brought arms to Israel during the merging of the defense forces into the newly created IDF. The Irgun wanted to arm its own troops within the IDF essentially creating a sub-military within the IDF \"an army within an army\" according to Ben-Gurion. Fighting broke out at Kfar Vitkin near netanya when the Altalrna first tried to land and Israelis died in the initial fighting. After the ship to land in Tel-Aviv it was shelled by IDF forces (different accounts say either once or a few times.) Begin the head of the Irgun surrendered the ship in order to avoid a full blown civil war. \n\n*the tragic part of this is how many soldiers refused to fight each other until it was absolutely necessary. Many of them were survivors of the Holocaust and/or antisemitism and couldn't bring themselves to kill another Jew.",

The Treaty of S\u00e8vres gave Greece quite a bit of land in Anatolia, Greece overplayed its hand by trying to conquer land up until Ankara after the Treaty, Greece eventually lost the war (and its allies) despite having better momentum initially, and thus lost the aforementioned regions of Anatolia permanently. The saddest moment in the entirety of Greek history, and it's even sadder that it was caused by our own stupidity.

The reality is actually even worse than what OP describes. \n\nPalestine has actually accepted multiple peace deals, the most notable being the Oslo Accords (culminating in the Madrid Conference), the Camp David Accords, and the Road Map for Peace. The problem is that Palestine never actually abides by the terms of these deals. The Oslo Accords and Madrid Conference triggered a decade-long wave of Palestinian terrorism, culminating in the Afula and Dizengoff Center massacres. The Camp David Accords were ended by the Second Intifada. Road Map for Peace eventually resulted in a Palestinian civil war that splintered Fatah and culminated in the Gaza War. At the end of the day Palestine has broken every peace treaty it's ever signed. \n\nMost of these deals explicitly gave the Palestinians everything they said they wanted, leading to the [accurate](https://www.usip.org/blog/2023/01/how-do-israeli-and-palestinian-youth-view-prospects-peace) perception that there is no serious political will for a long-term peace within Palestinian leadership or in the general population.\n\nYou don't have to like how Israel treats Palestinians within its borders - Israel's occupation is an unceasing human rights disaster - but there's simply no intellectually credible way to pretend like the Palestinians haven't made their own bed on this issue.",

The fact is, Arabs don\u2019t want to live in a world where Israel is a thing. It\u2019s never about fairness, justice, or anything of the like. They are just upset that every time they started a war against Israel they lost. And each time, Israel offered peace, but Palestine kept attacking again, and again, and again, in hopes of finally getting what they wanted: the death of the idea of the State of Israel. Because the combined strength of Syria, Iran, Palestine, and extremists in surrounding countries is nothing compared to Israel\u2019s, they switched to a PR campaign in hopes of smearing Israel, like that time in 2021 where Hamas hid military equipment in residential buildings, hoping Israel would blow them up and look bad(doing this makes the buildings military targets). I mean, who does that? They sacrifice their people in hopes that Israel would look bad.\n\nAll this talk about \u2018free Palestine\u2019 is so misinformed. If Palestine were free, 10 million Israelis would die. Regardless, everyone on Reddit would probably rejoice. \n\nWhile Israel isn\u2019t perfect, the alternative is literally another Iran, a country whose entire identity is literally based on hating non-Muslims(and even then they hate most Muslims for being Sunni).\n\nMost of these things are done by Gaza. They\u2019re the ones that elected Hamas, attack Israel, and make up a sob story later. I don\u2019t really have an issue with the West Bank(I\u2019ve been, and it\u2019s pretty chill), my issue is with Gaza being so insane even Egypt puts a border wall with them. And yet, the majority of people here defend both Gaza and the West Bank. I\u2019m surprised your comment has done so well, these things are normally downvoted hard.\n\nThis is exactly why people need to do their own research before forming an opinion anout something. Because then they find themselves arguing for a reality where there is actual mass genocide and ethnic cleansing.",

I also get that the Palestinians are having the very same battle.

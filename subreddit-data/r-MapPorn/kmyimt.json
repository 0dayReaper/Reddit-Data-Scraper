You are still Aruban, and when you come to the mainland (European) Netherlands, an immigrant. \nBut, if you life on St. Eustatia, Bonair or Saba (the other 3 Caribbean islands in the Kingdom) you are Dutch. This is because these 3 are municipalities of the Netherlands (but not part of the EU). \n\nIt is a bit like the British island Man was. Part of the UK, but not of the EU (of course now no part of the UK is part of the EU).",

The region of Holland was/is mainly characterized by the original Hollandic dialect, and some social aspects that were/are unique to the Hollandic people, who were distinct 'tribes' from other Middle-Frankish societies in the early history of the Netherlands. Because Holland was the most populous region, and because the Dutch language was standardized based on mostly Hollandic dialects, the language and country are often still associated with the term 'Holland'. It's mostly just a matter of perceived importance, which can be a bit unfair towards the many Dutch people who do not actually live in the region of Holland. The adjective 'Hollands' is however more commonly used by Dutch people to refer to things that are actually 'Nederlands'/'Dutch'. Even for the Dutch, this is very confusing stuff.\n\nTo make it more confusing, Dutch is a Germanic language, but not a 'German' language. So it's correct to say in Dutch: \"Nederlands is Germaans, Duits is ook Germaans\", which translates to \"Dutch is Germanic, German is also Germanic\" in English, or \" Niederl\u00e4ndisch ist germanisch, Deutsch ist auch germanisch\" in German. Now if you can remember that, you are bound to win at least once in a game of Trivia. Also, Pennsylvanian Dutch is not a Dutch, but German daughter language.",

Other provinces like Brabant, Friesland, Guelders, Li\u00e8ge and Groningen seemed to have had less notoriety with foreigners. \n\n\nNowadays, in Belgium itself, the meaning of Flanders has expanded to encompass the entirety of the Northern, Dutch-speaking part of Belgium. Which also includes the parts of the historical/cultural regions of Brabant and Limburg that are situated in Belgium. Confusing? You bet your ass. \n\n\n\nAlso fun fact: Belgica used to be the Latin name for the Netherlands (or Low Countries, or modern-day Benelux region), and it was inherited from the name of a Roman province of Gaul that corresponds more or less with modern day Belgium and Luxembourg, but also a big chunk of France and Germany and a small part of the Netherlands.",

It's also sometimes used as a handy shorthand to refer to Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg as a cultural or geographical region.\n\n\nThe \"Low Countries\" is another term that is used as a collective term for Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. In football (soccer) you have the \"Derby of the Low Countries\", which is the name for a football match between Belgium and the Netherlands. \n\n\n\nHistorically, in the Middle Ages, Renaissance and Baroque era, \"the Netherlands\" was the term that was used to refer to those \"Low Countries\" (which also included parts of what is now Northern France and Western Germany). The Latin name that was used for this area was \"Belgica\".  \n\n\nIt started out in the Middle Ages as a loose collection of duchies, counties and fiefdoms that were collected like Pok\u00e9mon by a branch of the Burgundian Habsburgs (always those damn Habsburgs!!) and turned into something that [almost resembled a coherent country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_Provinces).\n\n\nThen it came into the hands of the Spanish Habsburgs and the Northern part (which mostly corresponds to the *current* Netherlands) managed to secede, creating the [Dutch Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Republic). Meanwhile, the Southern part (which mostly corresponds to current-day Belgium and Luxembourg) stayed under the influence of the Spanish, and later the Austrian, Habsburgs. They were henceforth known as the Southern Netherlands, until the French Revolution broke out and the Revolutionaries annexed it into France. \n\n\nAfter Napoleon was defeated in 1815, the European powers decided it would be nice to reunite the two parts of the old Netherlands to have a buffer state against the French, creating the [United Kingdom of the Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_the_Netherlands). Unfortunately, it didn't work out great, as the two parts had grown estranged in the preceding centuries, and the Southern part seceded in 1830 to form the Kingdom of Belgium. \n\n\n\nHolland and Flanders were both provinces that were situated in the Western parts of the Low Countries. They were by far the wealthiest parts of the region and among the wealthiest regions in Europe during the Late Middle Ages. So foreigners started to use \"Holland\" and \"Flanders\" in a haphazard fashion to refer to the whole area. \n\n\nNowadays Holland is also used widely as a synonym for the modern-day Kingdom of the Netherlands, while Flanders is used as a name for the Northern, Dutch-speaking part of Belgium. \n\n\n\nThis shit's confusing af",

It is an attitude that exist throughout all layers of society, some politicians and civil servants are even openly outspoken about it. Regional policy makers have on occasion even refused using 'Holland' in documents.\n\nIt is a really weird attitude and depending on the location and people you meet it can get really confrontational and unfriendly.",

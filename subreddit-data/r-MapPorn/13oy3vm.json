Exactly four cities have metro (U-Bahn) networks in Germany: Berlin - the biggest and foremost network, Hamburg, Munich and Nuremberg.\n\nA few more cities *claim* to have U-Bahnen in Germany, but those are mostly using that as a marketing term, where in reality their \"U-Bahn\" is a mix of of tram/light rail systems better called \"Stadtbahn\" (city rail). Those include networks like Frankfurt, Cologne, Dortmund and many more.\n\nThus, a [more complete version of this map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/OePNVSystemeDeutschland.png) can be found here, albeit it less nice illustrated.",

Berlin and Hamburg have large parts of it run as overground lines on viaducts, the Hamburger operator is even called \"Hamburger Hochbahn\" but the network is without a doubt a full metro/U-Bahn.\n\nNo, the definition of a metro is (in Germany at least) a closed mass transit train system, running on its own track, decoupled from any individual traffic without intersections with street-level traffic.\n\nMost city rail networks (Stadtbahnen) in Germany fail to meet that last criteria, Stuttgart included. That does not mean that larger parts of the tramway/city rail couldn't run underground nonetheless, giving it in segments characteristics of an actual U-Bahn (another example for that would be Dortmund or Vienna's underground tramway). \n\nSee [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadtbahn](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadtbahn) ([English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadtbahn)) for the type of mass transit Stuttgart's tram lines fall into.",

Even before the Deutschlandticket, I would take the RB to visit my brother with my normal tram ticket.\n\nThe distinction used in the Map up there is completely arbitrary and has no practical application.

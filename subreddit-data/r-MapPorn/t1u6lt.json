The weather in the Med basin is controlled by two phenomena: cold fronts in the winter, which bring rain, and subtropical high pressure systems in the summer, which bring drought. Now, there are two kinds of subtropical high that can interest the area: the first kind develops over the North Atlantic and is known as the **Azores high**. To meet the Mediterranean, it needs to migrate north-eastwards. The second HP system is the **Saharan high**, much bigger, stronger and more brutal, which develops over North Africa and needs to migrate northwards to meet Europe.\n\nUp to about 25 or so years ago, the Saharan high was a very rare occurrence, and the typical mediterranean summer was dominated by the Azores high, which retreated back to the Atlantic in the winter to allow for cold fronts to bring rain to the area.\n\nBut global warming has made the Saharan high much stronger than it used to be,  much more prone to migrate northwards, so now we have Saharan heatwaves practically every summer. The Saharan high is a bully, it pushes the Azores high out of the way, towards the UK, causing unusual summer drought there. Not just that, but when it's winter, and the high pressure is supposed to retreat to allow for cold fronts to do their thing, because it has been pushed so far north, the Azores high fails to retreat completely. Instead, it sits over southern Europe all winter, preventing any cold fronts from reaching the area.\n\nThe east Med is further away from the North Atlantic, so it's safe from the influence of the Azores high.",

I worry about the future of our state. I'm glad my kids got to see snow... This might be something they tell their grandkids about mythically.",

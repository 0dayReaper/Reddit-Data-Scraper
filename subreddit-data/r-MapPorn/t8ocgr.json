It has not sent new shipments of arms and materials to Ukraine either.* \n\n&gt; *The rhetoric coming from Ankara is that Turkey is a loyal member of NATO but also has to take care of its national interests. What this means in practice is that Erdo\u011fan is still angling to be a mediator between Moscow and Kyiv, an offer he first made during a visit to Ukraine in early February. Now that the first round of talks between the two sides, held at the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, have yielded no cease-fire, he is discussing the matter with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, too. More importantly, Zelenskyy already mentioned Istanbul as a potential site for negotiations.* \n\n&gt; https://www.politico.eu/article/turkey-between-a-rock-and-a-hard-place-on-russia\n\nLooks like Erdogan is gunning to be the eventual peacemaker in the conflict.",

At the onset of the war these 2 cargo planes had made it to Kiev and my bet is that they were carrying military advisors or even drone operators. Losing Ukraine's black sea coast to Russia would be a geo-political nightmare for Turkey and thus Turkey have every interest in supporting Ukraine. However, this has to be done in relative secrecy in order to secure the, already mentioned, economic ties with Russia which are deeply embedded in Turkish economy. Zelensky thanked Erdogan many times and I can confidently state that Turkey contributed to the Ukranian war effort more than most countries that are highlighted here.",

So for example Turkey was neutral in ww2 as well. Turkey also tried to be neutral when USA decided to invade Iraq etc. We are now neo-swiss haha.\n\nEdit: for Syria comments: What are you even talking about? Turkey haven\u2019t \u201cinvade\u201d Syria to damage it or gain lands. There was a Kurdish state propaganda and Turkey worked with Syria and Russia to no let them do that. Again, worked with Syria. Also a little note, Turkey holds 8+ million Syrian refugees. That\u2019s far much than your pro-Syrian countries I\u2019m sure.\n\nfor Armenia comments: Again what? That happened during ww1, I said after ww1. If you are talking about the recent thing is just the same as Ukraine, we just sold weapons and tried to be a peacekeeper.\n\nFor Cyprus comments: There was a Greek aggresion going on and Turkey helped another Turkish people to balance it. Northen Cyprus is not even Turkey, it\u2019s an entirely different independent state. That happened because entire world kept their mouth shut just like they did for Bosnia. Turkey was the only nation that could help them and we got sanctions for it. Turkey stopped the aggression and gained nothing, but we are still proud that we have humanity. Just ask it to any Turkish person, everyone approved that. Again Turkey wasn\u2019t there to gain anything, it\u2019s an entirely different and independent country.",

But during neutrality in times of war the Black sea is closed to everyone other than black sea nations. But if One of these nations is the warring side they also lose their chance to use it. Right now I am not sure if it is a big bother to Russia as they clearly have whatever they need in Black sea. \n\nThe real problem that pushes Turkey towards neutrality though is the coopetation in Syria and Russia being a very important trade partner. So yes, we wont be buying gas from them due to embargo but russian tourists bring billions of dollars to the country and that will probably continue for now. And our fledgling economy needs every cent at the moment.",

They might not be unfriendly but that doesn't make them friends.",

So there is nothing economically Turkey can do on Russia BUT Turkey has armed the Ukrainian military before the war which is what they need-. Equipments, Drones, Corvets and also Ships proceeding in Turkish shipyard for Ukrainian Navy. TR declared its full support to Ukraine.  \n So as an ally Turkey did what it could do and for avoiding Economical effects, it prefers to get a peacemaker role between the sides which Ukraine also needs. THAT'S WHY Zelenskyy talks positively about Turkey. You mad Europeans that has DEVELOPED countries need to DO something as a sanction. Europe should stop providing Gas turbines -to Russia- which has a key role in Russian Defence Industry.  Europe should stop supporting Russia in Libya instead of Turkey. Then talk about it.",

The cheese we mostly eat is usually quite mild and I think most Europeans generally like more strong tasting cheeses.\n\nCheeses like Edam and Emmental are really common in Finland. The most popular cheese in Finland is however [\"kermajuusto\"](https://www.vastavalo.net/albums/userpics/19242/normal_IMG_4336.jpg) which stands for cream cheese but has nothing to do with what English call \"cream cheese\". It is a very mild tasting creamy and soft cheese. If I understand right it is somewhat popular Finnish product in Russia as well.",

                    "comment": "Tbh our cuisine is not that similar. Irish cuisine is even more meat &amp; dairy heavy than British cuisine with regards to traditional recipes &amp; in general with regards to modern food we are very novelty seeking &amp; experimental. \n\nModern Irish cuisine includes the following: \nThe jumbo breakfast roll: a full Irish breakfast stuffed into a French baguette with grated cheese on top\n\nChicken fillet roll: southern fried chicken stuffed into a French baguette with salad &amp; often coleslaw &amp; grated cheese\n\nJambon: a flaky pastry nest filled with ham &amp; cheese \n\nSpicebag: Chinese crispy chicken strips tossed in with lumps of chilli peppers, assorted spices &amp; assorted vegetables (mostly carrots &amp; onions) with chips &amp; served in a brown paper bag. \n\n4 in 1: a Chinese curry hybrid sauce served over rice, chips &amp; (sometimes tempura battered) chicken served in a plastic or aluminium takeaway box \n\nWe went through a short phase of adding wasabi to everything including multiple brands of crisps. \n\nBlack &amp; white pudding (lightly spiced pigs blood, oat &amp; barley sausage, lightly spiced fatty pork meat, oat &amp; barley sausage) pizza with plenty cheese \n\nScampi (Irish recipe of battered prawns) in multiple forms including in limerick city in tacos &amp; burritos \n\nSeafood chowder: a thick creamy mixed seafood, bacon &amp; cheese soup \n\nWe also use such copious amounts of garlic even the Mediterraneans cry for restraint. There is also at least 1 if not 2 whole large onions in every family meal. We are also now enormous fans of chilli. \n\nThere is also a French lad (tbh i think North African actually) doing a flying trade in Cork city selling us \u201cFrench tacos\u201d which tbh are mostly just a brick of ground meat &amp; copious amounts of Brie or blue cheese encased in a tortilla. \n\nDon\u2019t get me started on the wraps. \n\nAs well as that we have wholly embraced South American food &amp; continue, as touched upon by this comment to hybridise it with everything. We shall soon, please god, have perfected Irish-Chinese-French/French Canadian-Mexican fusion food in the Atlantic corridor up to cork as we are working hard on it in Limerick &amp; Galway aided by the international pharma &amp; aeronautical workers bringing us new &amp; strange flavours \nCork city, aided by the tastes of the tech workers should shortly have Irish-Italian-French-Polish-German-Turkish fusion cuisine down albeit us further west are already widely serving ours. \nBig shout out to the Pakistani lads for fusing Italian food with kebabs, ye have been an inspiration &amp; in Limerick we are looking forward to the addition of the Koreans with the bubble tea fusing Korean, Franco-Belgian &amp; Italian on the much neglected deserts sector. Also in the deserts sector we have massively expanded what the Americans were doing with donuts &amp; what the Mexicans were doing with churros to the degree that the line between donuts,churros &amp; cakes is completely blurred beyond recognition. We haven\u2019t figured out how to incorporate French pastry yet but we are working tirelessly on it. \n\nAlso for some reason we have both flavours of South Africans coming to roughly the same areas seemingly trying to get away from each other &amp; failing miserably. Kerry mostly. They are making an impact on a house party level in Kerry, Cork, Galway &amp; Mayo but have yet to make a commercial impact rather than teaching teenagers slurs in Supermacs in Tralee after the pubs close. Biltong is taking off well though in the snack sector.",

The difference between them would be comparable to the differences between Spanish and Japanese or English and Swahili. The various Inuit languages have been influenced variously by other Native American languages, Danish, English, and French. Yakut, on the other hand, has been influenced by other Siberian languages, Mongolic languages and Russian. The Inuit languages (including Inuktitut, Greenlandic, Innuinaqtun, etc) ultimately derive from Proto-Eskaleut (Proto-Eskimo-Aleut) while Yakut ultimately derives from Proto-Turkic.",

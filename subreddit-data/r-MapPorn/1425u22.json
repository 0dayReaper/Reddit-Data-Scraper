The Exclusive Economic Zone is only an economic zone, for fishing, oil and windmills, but they are international waters nonetheless. US customs has no say about what happens on ships outside 24 nautical miles offshore (12 nm territorial sea + another 12 nm 'contiguous zone' for specific causes), even when it is still their EEZ.\n\nAnyone, even your worst nuclear armed enemy, is free to sail in an EEZ up to 12 nm offshore. They can't catch a single herring, but they are free to patrol in a different country's EEZ, and even lay cables and pipelines. \n\nIn international straits like the Channel, where two countries' sovereign borders meet (ie no EEZ between them), a special regime applies that also grants right of transit passage by ship, submarine or aircraft.",

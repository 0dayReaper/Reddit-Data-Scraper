In that extreme case, it's more like:\n\nAbout 5 months of sun (though never high in the sky, peaking at ~23 degrees above the horizon)\n\nAbout two weeks of sunset, with the sunset travelling around the horizon once per day.\n\nAbout two months of slowly dimming twilight, with the brightest part likewise travelling along the horizon.\n\nAbout two months of unambiguous night.\n\nAbout two months of slowly brightening dawn.\n\nAbout two weeks of sunrise.\n\nRepeat.",

The top, 90\u00b0 N, is the North Pole, the middle, 0\u00b0, is the equator, and the bottom, 90\u00b0 S, is the South Pole.  \nDetermine what part of the year it is (for me, today, it's May 27th, so almost halfway across the image), then determine your latitude (for me, its 30\u00b0 N, so just above the tropic of cancer). The point where these intersect shows you how much sunlight you'll see (for me, just about 14 hours).",

On June 21st at the north pole, it's daylight all day, hence white.  On that same day at the south pole, it's dark all day, hence dark grey. I'm in orange, which is a pretty bright color, meaning I have more daylight than dark time. In Australia, it's blue, indicating that it's dark more than it's light outside at this time of year.",

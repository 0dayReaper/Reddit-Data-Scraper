                                    "comment": "The source is some **1897** manual made by an english atheist who just wanted to shit on religion ( I am an atheist myself, but this is ultra biased ). This is to say this is NOT a historical text. It is NOT a historical source for anything \"battle\" or \"war\" related. It is purely about religion, theology-philosophy and ethics.\n\n\\[ Wikipedia claims the Source is The Rationalist\\`s Mind 1897 by M. D. Aletheia \\]. \n\nWikipedia also doesn\\`t give a page-number, which it usually should. This is just pure fantasy and made up. **I don\\`t know why Wikipedia allowed that as source.**.... It\\`s friggin INSANE:\n\nI tried to search for the exact sentence where it claims that 7 million died in the Reconquista, I haven\\`t found it that statement, the google preview allows to watch ALL pages, so even the citation is wrong. The only time spain and 7 million are mentioned : \n\nThe numbers are absolutely ridiculous :\n\n&gt;*\"Let us look for a moment at the number of victims sacrificed on the altars of the Christian Moloch :* ***1.000.000 perished during the early Arian schism***\\*;\\* ***1.000.000 during the Carthaginian struggle***\\*;\\* ***7.000.000*** *during the Saracen slaughters. In Spain* ***5.000.000*** *perished during the eight Crusades;* ***2.000.000*** *of Saxons and Scandinavians lost their lives in opposing the introduction of the blessings of Christianity;* ***1.000.000*** *were destroyed in the Holy Wars against the Netherlands, Albigenses, Waldenses and Huguenots;* ***30.000.000 Mexicans and peruvians were slaughteed*** *ere they could be convinced of the beauties of the Christian creed;* ***9.000.000 were burned for witchcraft***\\*; Total : 56.000.000\"\\*\n\nThis is page 88. [https://books.google.de/books?id=b1I2AQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=de#v=snippet&amp;q=Spain&amp;f=false](https://books.google.de/books?id=b1I2AQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=de#v=snippet&amp;q=Spain&amp;f=false) \n\nSo someone clearly didn\\`t read that properly. The 7 million is about the Saracens ( i.e. middle eastern Crusades ), the text mentions 5 million for the Spanish Reconquista, and even that is wrong. ( So not only is the source wrong, whoever used that source didn\\`t read it properly ).   \nThere is no other mention of Spain, or any historical casualties. This paragraph is everything, the rest seems to be about religion, christianity, ethics and so on. Again it\\`s a criticism of christianity, not a text that you can or should use to claim 7 million died in X conflict. \n\n*To correct some these ridiculous numbers.* \n\n1. Instead of 9 million, only 35.000 ( 35 thousand ) up to 50.000 were killed during the 350 years of witch-persecutions. Of those 12.000 were executed in witch trials ( there were about 125.000 witch trials, 64% ended in an innocent verdict, and only 10% in execution ), the rest perished during violent mobs attacking so-called \"witches\". The author claims 9 million. This is by far the most eggregious error and should disqualify him as a source for any numbers he give ( another aspect why he should be disqualified IS THAT HE IS NOT WRITING A HISTORICAL TEXT. It\\`s an anti-religious essay, he doesn\\`t give any source for his few paragraphs where he uses historical examples. He just flat out claims \"this many millions died due to Christianity\"\n2. There didn\\`t even existed tens of millions of people in all of North and South America at the time. And the author, from the late 19th century, still believed the myth that the Natives were slaughted en masse. While the European colonization was certainly not \"gentle\" in any way, the vast, vast majority of Native Americans perished due to their lack of resistance to the bacteria and viruses the European brought ( who had more resistance due to their urban-history ). There was no massive genocide of 30 million Mexicans and Peruvians. The time where Americans actually slaughtered natives happend in the 1800-1900 ( trail of tears, forced migrations,\n3. He claims 1 million died during the Arian Schism. This was a purely theological schism that happend in the church. There were no countries that fought between the Creed of Chalcedon versus the Arian Creed. So he doesn\\`t even know anything about the topic he talks about...\n4. I don\\`t know what he references with the Carthaginian struggle. It would not surprise me if he believed the early Roman Empire was also christian when it fought against the Carthaginians/Punic Wars, because he knows fuck all about history.\n5. 7 Million during the Saracen struggles. Now Saracen was a historical term used for all Muslims of North Africa, the Levant and Arabian peninsula. Even during his own time ( Victorian England ) the term fell out of use, it was mostly used during the 11th - 16th centuries. And the number 7 million, is again utterly ridiculous. The Saracen struggles most likely references to the Crusades targeting the Holy Land. However in total about 1.5 - 2 million died in those crusades. ( there are many problems with that number aswell, i.e. the lack of Arab sources, as contemporary Arabs didn\\`t care about the Crusaders and focused their attention on the various competing Muslim empires, whereas the Christian contemporary sources liked to inflate the numbers to talk about a great holy struggle ). But honestly I don\\`t care, even the 1.5 - 2million number is several leagues away from the 7 million.\n6. The 2 million of the Saxon and Scandinavian conversion is also wrong. Both went mostly entirely peaceful. Charlemagne did invade the Kingdom of Saxony, where about 30.000 died and massacres were committed by the Christian Franks, i.e. the Massacre of Verden where 4.500 Saxons were murdered and their holy Irminsul was burned.\n7. The 1 million number against the Netherlands ( dunno what that references ), Albigenses, Waldenses and Huguenots is mostly accurate, perhaps a bit overblown, but several hundreds of thousands died in the Albigenses Crusade alone.\n\nThe author is very much a product of his time, 1890s Victorian England. So his absolutely insane propaganda should not surprise anyone.\n\nThis is one of the examples where Wikipedia is just completely unreliable. Because someone allowed that source, an ultra-biased anti-religious essay with no historical accuracy or any sources from the late 19th century is taken as fact for the Reconquista.",

However Draper did NOT give any information on the number of casualties in any of these religious conflict... \n\n[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1185/1185-h/1185-h.htm#](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1185/1185-h/1185-h.htm#) \n\nLooking at various keywords, Draper did not give any information on the number of casualties in any conflict. The various mentions of \"Spain\" or \"Spanish\" don\\`t talk about casualties. \r  \n\r\n\nSo the author of the Rationalist Manual literally made these numbers up. (  I really like catching these idiots on their faulty articles/sources :P )\n\nSadly this led to the wrong casualties on Wikipedia, and sadly various other articles just uncritically use Wikipedia as a source. And the nationalinterest doesn\\`t even give Wikipedia as a source ( it doesn\\`t have any ), but it should be Wikipedia because nobody else mentions these 7 million. \n\nSuch as this article [https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/4-most-destructive-conflicts-all-human-history-162752#:\\~:text=The%20Spanish%20Reconquista%2C%20which%20began,accounted%20for%207%20million%20dead](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/4-most-destructive-conflicts-all-human-history-162752#:~:text=The%20Spanish%20Reconquista%2C%20which%20began,accounted%20for%207%20million%20dead). ( literally first link when you google \"how many people died during the Reconquista\" )\n\nKinda sad. Not only that websites uncritically use Wikipedia, or that Wikipedia allowed such an insane source to exist for several years.",

Some research says it was as high as 112 million, and others say it was 8 million. Myself, I think it's likely somewhere in between, towards the low side, like 30 or 40 million. You had entire vast cities and empires over here. They are just finding evidence of large cities in Mississippi and other areas suggesting large trading hubs that were never found by Europeans because the disease whipped them out, and the natives just placed out and moved west. \n\nI would agree most of the 56 million who died from 1492 to 1600 were killed by disease, but millions were killed by Spanish slave labor practices at the time. They did not see a problem with treating slave or infidels in this way as the Bible doesn't say not to, only you can't have Christian slaves. This was a raging theological debate of the time. Some said, You shouldn't evangelize slaves / natives because then they can't be slaves. Others,  but spreading the word of God is our mission as Christians.  Enter Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas.  \n\nWell done on your research though and excellent post! Appreciate what you did and agree with the notion that the casualty clicker here being silly. Many times people try to inflate numbers of history to make it sound like more modern numbers. It is more impactful to speak in terms of % of population dying.  Say like the first wave of black death, it killed about 50% of Europe, and likely Asia too... today that would be billions of people.

That's about a third of the population. And that's a modern population with high life expectany and low child mortality.\n\nNow ofc medieval Spain did not have 80 million inhabitants, but if we take the floated number of 9 million. Assume at least half of the population died every 25 years and that would be a low figure, i would i think it would be much higher rate, thanks to child mortality.\nBut even still 4.5 million every 25 years over 800 years gets us to 4.5 x 32 = 144 million.\n\n7 million deaths over 8 centuries is only 8750 deaths per years, that's an easily believable conflict related death rate.",

Muslim kingdoms fought each other as much as they fought the Christians. Sometimes Christian kingdoms would ally with Muslims against other Christians if it suited them and vice versa.\n\nThe same thing happened in the Balkans. The idea of \"Christianity uniting against Islam\" may have been true in a few specific circumstances, but it's mostly a modern rewriting of history.",

The muslim armies reach (and took, assault and/or sack) parts of the actual basque country, also the actual Galicia, the actual Asturias, etc. several times. They reach the north coastline and they even named governors for this area (read about Munuza [here](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munuza)). What they never were able to do was retaining these territories for a long time, because they needed to hold all their military power in Cordoba and the distances for that time between the capital and that mostly useless part of the peninsula were too big to excert a complete control over them. By that time the north peninsula in terms of richness and resources wasn't worth the effort and the only reason they go there from time to time was because all the people there had the bad manners to uprise from time to time and were a danger for their northern border.",

To avoid his defeat, the king of Granada signed a treaty with the king of Castile, where he would cede Ja\u00e9n and become a vassal of Castile in exchange for peace and recognition.\n\nAs part of this treaty, the Muslims of Granada helped the king of Castile to conquer Muslim Seville, the most important city of Andalusia.\n\nThey survived as vassals for two centuries, because Castile wasn\u00b4t interested in an arduous fight in a very mountainous region with little profit, when the tributes were easier. Also, Castile was more occupied with their own civil wars and against Portugal.\n\nThe only fights were around the Strait of Gibraltar (where there were multiple alliances between Castile, Granada and the Marinid Sultanate from Morocco, in all possible combinations).\n\nWhen Isabella of Castile came to the throne in 1474, she and her husband Ferdinand decided in a politics of ethnic unity, conquering Granada (much weaker by now due to its own civil wars) and expelling the Jews.",

Spain wasn't even a thing officialy until the start of the 17th century, before that it was a personal union lead by Castille over Aragon, Navarra and Naples, so hardly a basis for an empire because that assumes a unified realm with strong centralisation. Which was not the case at all. It is true they became a major power through colonialism and expanded from there on out. They also got into the whole Habsburgs mess with Austria, which made it even harder because of later on inheritting territories in Italy and the Lowlands. They might be seen as an empire by then, but because of bad centralisation and management of other territories outside of the Iberian peninsula and being on the verge of economic collapse all the time, they are the worst example of an empire in this era.",

You may opine on how much power the King had in reality, but that is a comment on the internal power dynamics of the Kingdom itself, not that it existed as a Kingdom and was recognized as such.\n\n&gt;They didn't last even a century in there. At the point the Reconquista started, Muslims had, historically speaking, more legitimacy than the Christians.\n\nThat's just not correct. The Visigoths had territory in the peninsula since early 400s, by late 400s already controlled the vast majority of the peninsula, and were only defeated in early 700s. That is over 200 years of being the main polity of the Iberian peninsula. Even if we're being generous and we count the start of the Muslim rule in the peninsula from the year that they invaded in 710s, the first expansions of the Kingdom of the Asturias took place in 730/740s, when they already had control of Galicia and Asturias. So it's not like the Reconquista only started after the Muslims had ruled the peninsula for centuries.\n\nBesides legitimacy is subjective, as what weight to factors that give legitimacy, arguing that X has more or less legitimacy than Y because of Z is bound to lead to disagreements.",

We had our own people there before they came in. The nature of medieval influence is counts and dukes trying to get more influence and power.\n\nReligion played a huge part in the conflict! The pope would not have called a crusade and we (you Spanish cunts) wouldn't have the French helping out on the fighting.",

I\u2019ve read anout the Reconquista and its history is waaay more complicated than just Moros vs. Criistianos killing each other constantly. There were entire centuries when borders didn\u2019t move and the Muslim rulers made pacts with the Christian ones and life went on for years until something would trigger an advance by the Christians or the Muslims, triggering a war campaign here and there. Also, the overwhelming majority of Muslims lived in cities in the southeastern part of what is now Andalusia, with entire swaths of land completely uninhabited.",

When England unified the system of shires as established in Wessex was applied to the rest of the country, so the land that was Jorvik formed a single shire county with three 'ridings' to subdivide it. Back then the North was very sparsely populated so it wouldn't have seemed so strange as it might to us.",

I wasn't curious at all, you believe me, right?\n\nEngland's historic counties were created by the Normans, generally based on existing administrative areas.\n\nScotland's historic counties (Shires of Scotland) were administrative counties until 1975, some of which date back to the 11th century. They seem to have changed more over the years, but I didn't go into great depth.\n\nThe Historic Counties of Wales are similar to Scotland, but they were replaced a year earlier.\n\nThere are also ceremonial counties of England and preserved counties of Wales, which appear to be the traditional rather than administrative counties. They're a bit different and there doesn't seem to be a Scottish equivalent.\n\nI looked up Ireland too - both parts. It's too complicated to summarise here and I'm too ignorant to pick out the important bits.\n\nThe knowledgable should feel free to correct me, I did my best within my (low) limits of enthusiasm.",

But many places did remain in the same county for centuries.\n\nThe current administrative divisions for many areas have the same name as these historic counties. There are some people who feel an attachment to these traditional divisions, particularly in the form shown here, which gives the borders from roughly 1889 to 1965. This appears to be from a campaign group which argues that they have some sort of continuing existence and should be signposted and used for more purposes.",

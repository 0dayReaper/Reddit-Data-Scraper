The socialist party got 4% up and the Communists got another 2% or 3% although those are more reactionary votes. The fifth party has an ethnocentric policy as opposed to the 3 parties above it and it's a bit more decisive than the current government,a bit more nationalistic. They got around 1% more. The radical leftists are out of the parliament but so is another nationalistic party,they both got close to 3% but were unable of crossing the threshold. The nationalists were actually 0.07 of the threshold so maybe they'll go through at the 2nd round. Around 42-48% didn't vote",

I also think that the 2 patriotic parties will help in the parliament to start taking action in our external affairs so we can at least protect the Greeks abroad. It's good that the radical left is out (the man was stupid,when asked what would he do if Turkey landed troops in a Greek uninhabited Island he said he'd call the west) and that the leftists are weakened since they didn't have any good candidates for ministers and their politic was basically \"do the opposite of government\". The communists are going up but I am not really worried many of their votes are not real and I don't think their program will ever come into fruition.",

The more I age and learn about politics, the more I love the idea of multi-party systems (actual MULTI) and the need to form coalition governments to get anything done. That way you can't have a 51/49 senate and 218 in the house and run with dictatorial powers if you also have the presidency.",

Although they said they wouldn't do that again maybe Erdogan is hoping to get rid of some of his migrants and cause more problems to Greece.\n\nBut that's just assumptions.

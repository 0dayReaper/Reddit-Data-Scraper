He does not realize that these early mosques could not face Mecca in the modern sense and that it is foolish to expect that they should. Nor could they face toward Petra in a modern sense. Anyway mosques do not face Mecca; they face the Kaaba. How does one face a distance edifice that one cannot see? The first generations of Muslims had their own way of doing this, which was fully in keeping with their knowledge of simple folk astronomy. The methods they used have been documented in scholarly literature. Gibson compares the HISTORICAL mosque orientations with MODERN directions of Petra and Mecca from these mosque locations. He does not realise that historical qibla directions cannot be the same as MODERN  qibla directions, except by coincidence. In fact, the earliest mosque orientations were not calculated at all, but relied on astronomical horizon phenomena, not least because the Kaaba itself is astronomically aligned. Astronomical alignments are found elsewhere in Arabia, particularly in monumental pre-Islamic Nabataean architecture.",

And worse than that,  \n&gt;  \n&gt; (h)  both  his  activities  in  a  field  which  he  does  not  master  and  his  false conclusions have already contributed to somewhat dubious causes.",

(if you want we include Jerusalem since its close by). even if in guahngzou china they got the direction to petra pretty acurrate, what a lucky coincidence isnt it.\n\n\\-They couldnt point them even in the general direction towards mecca because they couldnt tell the difference between the cardinal points.\n\nAll the while they navigate vast deserts for centuries without roads and any other points of reference except for the sky.\n\nSo conclusion for you to make it clear If they can point them generaly to Petra, they could have done the same with just pointing it at Mecca. And there is no argument that these both cities are in the same general direction 1000km difference makes this impossible. E.g. A mosque build in Baghdad (as shown on the picture) facing west should face south as a general direction even with rudementary technology.\n\nEither they had the knowledge and deliberitly faced petra in the first islamic century or they didnt and were just coincidently accurate towards petra.",

And why would most mosques build after 822AD suddenly face Mecca pretty accurate, they didnt invent GPS in this 150 years did they ?\n\nIf you consider as this reply also does that the nabatean and other carawan/trader cultures used astronomy to find directions in an everchanging(wind changes the dunes) desert enviroment in wich you have to know the direction or you are lost.\n\nThis confirms more than denies that the early builders exactly knew wich direction the mosque has to face. Consider also that \"modern\" petra is 1km west of \"historical\" Petra so in case of degrees that is not a big difference. So even If they couldnt get the degrees as exact as we can today, Petra is still around 1000km further north and that makes a big difference in degrees that cannot be explained by coincidence.\n\nSo make of it what you want and i am not claiming to know the truth.",

There are no olive trees on the arabian peninsula they grow only in the meditarenean area further north.\n\nThere is no parallel valley in mecca but in Petra.\n\nThere is no stream in Mecca just the sumsum well wich in itself wouldnt be able to hold a population larger then 100 people and certainly no carawans. It\u00b4s just to dry. Petra has a sophisticated water system fed by a natural spring becoming a stream.\n\nSo these informations are taken from the Quran and checked with modern knowledge about these areas and their geographie. \n\nDan gibson is not really relevant as far as his credibility since its just an aspect of the theory (qibla). So you yourself can open your quran and write down everything you read about the descriptions of the places where the prophet lived and than you go and check what you can find out about Mecca. You can even do a quick google maps and compare the two with the despriction. So the \"Dan Gibson is an Amateur\" argument is polemic and doesnt solve the issue at hand. Thats enough Fitna from me today.\n\nI hope i can spark some second thoughts to yourself and not some blind following of what someone tells you anyway.\n\nhave a good one",

So even if they had more he just decided what to take and what not. All this 200 years later.\n\nIf you really were clever you would argue like every knowlegable muslim would and say there is  chain from the sahada to bukhari (isnad) and here i have to admit it is difficult because it might be that everyone in the chain gave the saying truthfully and correct.

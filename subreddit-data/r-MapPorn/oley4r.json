Athens is practically geographically centered in Greece!\n\nBut there's a reason that Ankara is the capital of Turkey and not Istanbul; Rome the capital of Italy and not Milan; Riyadh the capital of Saudi Arabia and not Jeddah; Abuja the capital of Nigeria and not Lagos. In large countries, having a centrally-located capital is vital to making sure no given region feels too far away from the center of government. In smaller countries, like Slovakia and Lithuania, it's less important; in extremely large countries, like China, Russia, and the United States, people are going to feel far away from the Capital no matter what, so you might as well put it wherever is most convenient.",

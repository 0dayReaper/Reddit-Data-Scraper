Also the scale isn't even defined.\n\nI'm assuming blue means that the country almost exclusively sees people immigrating to the USA rather than people from the USA immigrating there, while mixes of grey and yellow mean different degrees of people moving to or from the US.\n\nIt would probably be helpful for this map to be paired with a map of overall number of immigrants to and from the US, because this map shows a major lean towards people immigrating from the US to Libya, but I can't imagine there's actually that many Americans deciding to move to Libya. \n\nFar more Americans probably move to Mexico than Libya, but this map doesn't convey that information, and even can be misinterpreted as suggesting otherwise.",

I wanted to place a definate change in color at 0% (I used yellow) and didn't want to use any colors generally associated with \"bad\" (ie. red). So I went with green = more out than in, yellow = 1 for 1 trade, and blue in more in than out. Most nations, as you can see, are functionally 100% immigration vs emigration (not that many people are moving out of the US).",

Erdo\u011fan's re-election just fuels this already existing brain dain, meaning that more doctors, engineers, you name it, are going to move to the US in the coming years",

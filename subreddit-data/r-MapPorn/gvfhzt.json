I've been a big proponent of Oceania instead of Australia but it seems that the continental landmass is Australia (and doesn't include some of the further outlying islands) and Oceania is the name of the region. But identifying the landmass as Australia leaves a bunch of islands not included in any continent so I would say that OPs teacher is both correct and incorrect - correct in that technically French is not spoken on the continent of Australia, but it is in the region of Oceania, which otherwise would have been totally excluded.\n\nI think Oceania is still a more effective way of distinguishing, as every country should be included in at least a region, but I was today years old when I learnt that not every country is actually in a continent (and I'm Australian lol).",

Guyana received more Hindus as they were moved within the British Empire from India, although it received a decent migration of Muslims as well.   Suriname has the largest concentration of Muslims in South America to this day.  Also the country had factions that couldn't agree on which direction was appropriate for praying toward Mecca. Some new migrants wanted to continue praying toward the West like they always had and others argued that to the North East was more appropriate as it was closer. This led to conflict between the groups.",

There\u2019s a cool story about a couple who spent over 2 years without any support vehicles and actually made it in their jeep cj-5. There is still the shell of an old Chevrolet Corvair in the jungle from when GM thought it would be a good idea to try and make it through with a few family sedans. Most people that drive the pan American highway find another traveler and share a cargo container with; taking a boat ride around it.",

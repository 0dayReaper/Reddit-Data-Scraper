An example of what needs permanent DST is Las Vegas with a solar noon of around 11:35 during winter (6:50 sunrise and 16:20 sunset), but making both of these an hour later (7:50 sunrise and 17:20 sunset) makes a lot more sense. That's why I am trying to create a time zone map which doesn't have pre-11:50 solar noons and fewer time zones.",

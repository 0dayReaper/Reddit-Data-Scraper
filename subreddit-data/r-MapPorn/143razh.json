Dresden and Leipzig are the only ones that are big enough to make a Bundesliga team seem natural, so teams in the states other than Saxony would need to overachieve to make it happen. Teams like Hansa Rostock or Energie Cottbus were mainstays in the 2000s but fell on hard times in the last decade in some kind of regression toward the mean.",

Freiburg, Wolfsburg, Hofenheim, Augsburg, Heidenheim, Kiel... Cities at the size of Rostock +/-... So doesn't apply that much speaking of the size of city in connection with not having a team in the bundesliga..  Could even put some of the \"Ruhrgebiet\" teams into the picture.. though the area is heavily populated.. the cities have not that huge population.. like M\u00f6nchengladbach and Gelsenkirchen (Schalcke)..",

There are certain cities that naturally have the economic and structural capacities to have a first division teams, teams from other cities have to overperform to reach that level. If there are not a lot of cities in the first place, that makes it even harder.",

The Treaty of Verdun is way overrated, as all 3 \"Francias\" were subdivided and ultimately the entire empire was reunited under Charles the Fat. It's around 887-888 that the empire collapsed. But it was a very progressive event.\n\nFrom 888 up until the 12th century, Germany was slowly becoming its own thing, developping its own identity distinct from the Franks from the 10th century onward. German scholars of the 12th century considered Henry the Fowler to be the first German king.\n\nOn the flip side, the Franks lost most of their conquered territories, only keeping the West. The Capetian dynasty began rulling France after they replaced the last carolingians. They still considered Clovis to be the first king of France.\n\nSo the Treaty of Verdun is not the birth of France and Germany, nor the birth of what would become France and Germany. France was already a thing, and Germany would only become a thing a bit later.",

I mean sure you can claim that France as we know it today was created in 1958 and that Germany as we know it today was created in 1990, but their earliest forms are still France and Germany...\n\nSure there was no real rivalry between France and Germany prior to the 30 years war.

And it is misleading if not wrong to equate Francia with France. Are the Bretons not French for you? Or the Aquitaines? Am I French - because I definitively was born in a region that belonged to Francia - even before Charles le Magne? \n\nFrance as a nation has a much longer history and identity than Germany. I say that as a German. It is a common misconception and it is a myth created on NATIONALIS PURPOSE. That\u2019s why it is bad to \u201csimplify\u201d just because Francia and France are derived from the same Latin term.\n\nThe German identity did not emerge in the 10th century. Asking an 12th century Saxon which nation or people he belonged to the answer would have been \u201cSaxon\u201d. No one in their right minds would have said German. That\u2019s a thing - at the earliest - in the 16th century.",

Because you can hardly find a successor state this obvious. \n\nAnd no Francia **is** France. Just because the borders changed through time that doesn't mean that it's not the same country. I mean there is a continuous line of rulers from Clovis up until Macron, only the regimes changed. You can ask any french guy who the first king of France is, and the answer will be Clovis every time. And that's not modern nationalistic revisionism, as this is consistent with what scholars said in the 10th, 12th, 17th, 19th centuries...\n\nAnd about German identity, it depends who you ask. If you ask a 12th century peasant, he will mostly only care about his region. But scholars and elite will give you different answers. Sure they wouldn't say that they are from \"Germany\", they would say that they are from Teutonia. Which is basically the same thing under a different name.",

But it is really hard to see the 30 Years War that created the political situation for that to happen in that light.\n\nI don\u2019t dispute the changing hands of border territories here - just the narrative of \u201cFrench vs Germans\u201d. That is 19th century historic fantasy driven by nationalist impulses and widely used by NS propaganda.",

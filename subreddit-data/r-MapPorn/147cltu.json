Despite the attempts of Czech and Slovak goverments, a lot of families don't send their children to school while teen pregnancy runs rampant. Czechia for instance has a government fund that helps young couples start families, by basically giving them kindergeld for every child born. This leads to abuse by gypsy 'benefactors', rich gypsies that move in couple of families into small flats or homes (living conditions in these places are terrible) and collect tribute from these families (who are sustaining themselves with   \ngovernment aid). I live in central Czechia so problem is not as pronounced as in eastern Moravia, but my neighbour is Roma that was adopted by Czech family. Completely normal and fun to be around person, working in retail. He was taken away from his family along with 10(!!!) of his siblings.",

I think OP should've at least clarified that\n\nEdit: OP kindly provided the methodology https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/w/ddn-20230424-2\n\n&gt;The child-specific deprivation rate is the percentage of children below 16 who suffer from the enforced lack of at least three items out of the following 17 (unweighted) items: \n    Child: Some new clothes \n    Child: Two pairs of shoes \n    Child: Fresh fruits and vegetables daily \n    Child: Meat, chicken, fish daily \n    Child: Suitable books \n    Child: Outdoor leisure equipment \n    Child: Indoor games \n    Child: Leisure activities \n    Child: Celebrations \n    Child: Invite friends \n    Child: School trips \n    Child: Holiday \n    Household: Replace worn-out furniture \n    Household: Arrears \n    Adults in the household: Internet\n    Household: Home adequately warm \n    Household: Car \n\nI disagree with #16: car. My family didn't have a car but we were still very comfortable because there was an adequate public transportation in my city. European cities are the best to live without a car. \n\nOther than that I think it's pretty comprehensive, although I'd put more weight on certain criteria and not in others. Ex: outdoor/indoor leisure equipment can be replaced by school activities, shared bikes etc. It's better measured by \"Invite friends\"",

Then again for cars I think a lot of people have a bias that owning a car is symbol of social status, etc., so they might want a car but not really need it (there's definitely people who do tho, like those living in sparse rural areas)",

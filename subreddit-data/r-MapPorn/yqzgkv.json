I saw it a few years ago and couldn't figure out how to find it again. \n\nIt's a great representation of not only population density, but it really highlights how stupid winner takes all races are. In most electoral maps, a county won by 1 vote looks exactly the same as a county that was a total rout. Not even getting into how it shows how votes for the candidate that lost are essentially just thrown away in our current system. \n\nThis is truly a great map.",

Our republic whether proportional or not is ranked down near Panama on both global scales. You probably didn't know that our primary system is not in the constitution and was put in place in Florida in 1901. Then other states joined in effectively controlling who runs and the rules to get in these primaries. This is in Wikipedia. Our system needs to be replaced. If the people were not so stupidly divided by their political leaders, they could come together and force real change. Not to put any one person in power but the real proportional power of a parliamentary systems and the many parties to represent the people.",

But I also recognize that I live in a very small country, not the vast expanse and populous United States.\n\nEven here the rural folk feel incredibly underrepresented in parliament, which is part of the reason (not the main one tho) for the recent problems.\n\nAdditionally, my country is a unitary state, so having a parliament on national proportional representation does not deal with issues such as \"state rights\" or things like that.\n\nI can also understand that a rural person living in Wyoming might feel powerless against East Coast urbanites who decide how their state should be run.\n\nAdditionally, you anglos (in particular Brits or Americans, not so sure about the rest) would have a nervous breakdown if a coalition would need to be formed. Just look at the panic when the British parliament required a coalition. Or when compromise needs to be struck between two parties for that to happen. *The horror* (It's normal where I'm from).\n\nSo proportional per state, or the Argentinian System as I like to call it, is a compromise between proportional representation and state representation/rights. It allows for smaller parties to win votes and thus have a voice without the general fear of a minority/coalition government that would scare the bejeezus out of the average american, but doesn't drown out large amounts of votes within a state. It works easier on the federal system and is a far easier/cheaper reform of the American system that would not scare the establishment too much into vehemently opposing it. It would also test the waters better to see if Americans could actually deal with a proper proportional system rather than just plunging in blindfolded.",

The Supreme Court ruled in 1893 that states can form compacts without the consent of Congress as long as they do not potentially interfere with the \"just supremacy of the United States,\" then it needs the consent of Congress. That means, federal law and constitution supercedes state law and constitutions. So states can't sign legislation that overrides federal legislation. \n\nBut also, I'm not sure if this arrangement would be legally binding or just an agreement between states. And what it does is that when enough states join for 270 electoral votes, they will all pass laws that their electors would go to the winner of national popular vote. That doesn't seem unconstitutional because states can choose how to assign their electors.",

Every issue winds up with only 2 solutions considered; the one the \"Left\" advocates for, and the opposite view the \"Right\" advocates for.\n\nI feel like this was considered much more acceptable many years ago, because both parties were likely to compromise -- making solutions that everyone was universally \"meh....\" about but would grudgingly accept. In modern times, both parties found you can go really far by being much more polarized. Promise \"no compromises!\" and attack the opposition at every opportunity. Lots of drama, which gets you lots of media coverage/airtime and popular zingers of quotes to pass around. America loves their sports teams. It's just an extension of that now. Red vs. Blue in the semi-finals leading up to the big general election showdown! \n\nI keep voting for the Libertarians myself, and they keep getting 1% to 3% of the vote. I think \\*so\\* many more people than that could get behind their views though. They just give up supporting a third party in the current electoral system and either abstain from voting at all, or vote for the Democrat or Republican they hope will side with a few more of their views.",

The best case is that they get slightly more attention in the first round, but they won't amount to anything if they still can't hold any office due to elections still being winner-takes-all. In some ways RCV would hurt third parties, because at least in FPTP if a third party gets big enough the most aligned major party is incentivized to adopt some of their platform (think UKIP pre-brexit or the Conservative party of Canada merging with the Reform party). In non-proportional RCV, the nearest major party doesn't have to make as many concessions to get the votes of third parties.\n\nTo break up the two party system the only way is to implement a truly proportional system (proportional, mixed-member proportional, single transferable vote) because third parties have to be able to walk away with some power without needing a majority, but nowhere in the US is implementing that. Instead states are, at best, just implement IRV to appease people who want reform while empowering establishment politics.",

Why? this isn't the land of huge factory farmers who can afford burdensome legislation. Higher gas and diesel taxes mean they can't transport, they can't feed their animals. Propositions for \"clean air and water\" means nothing in their operation will change, but another tax will be levied. The act says it will \"protect farmland\" but it never says HOW. and after years and years of families losing their farms and having to downsize under democratic rule it's no wonder they don't trust. \nThese things always sound nice on paper but the push for \"green\" has been a nightmare for farmers who rely on old equipment that they can fix themselves (no longer, hey now you need a \"green\" combine that's a million dollars for your 200,000 family farm) oh you can \"write it off\" but good luck. \n\nHonestly, I know it's filmed in the UK but Clarksons farm touches on the endless legalities farmers face and the costs and how they end up broke season after season. It's very similar in NYS. \n\nIt's funny, i'll be downvoted to hell and i'm sure some \"unverified farmer\" will chime in who only benefits from all the great things democrats do for rural areas, and then they'll say \"it's education, rural people are just stupid\" but the reality is. They aren't uneducated or stupid, their way of life is valid and they deserve representation. They feed you. I've known endless NYC folk who move to wine country to start a vineyard and within a couple years go HARD right. They end up being more vocal than the farmers who've been dealing with it all along and are just basically giving up. \n\nleft vs right isn't all \"abortion\" and \"racism\" like the media wants you to believe. A huge portion of it is a valid difference between people who rely on socialism because they live in cities and it makes more sense, and rural people who rely on themselves and their neighbors and have absolutely no use for the taxes they pay. \n\nThanks for listening",

It required an amendment to the constitution to be legal.  Today, the fed sets rules and standards on everything. Seatbelts are not a federal law at all.  However, the fed forced states to adopt it by threatening to withhold federal dollars for states that didn\u2019t pass the law.  Sounds good for safety, right?  Does congress really need to be engaged in seatbelt use or can states handle that?  In essence, the federal government uses the money it obtains from taxpayers in every state  to force compliance with federal mandates on everyday lives. While it does not appear to be a huge deal, let\u2019s think about what it can be used for. What happens if congress decides to withhold federal funding for unapproved medical procedures like abortion?  How about withholding federal funding from states that don\u2019t follow federal rules on gun control?  How about illegal immigration?

Rural Nebraskans can decide on the residents of Brooklyn, as their vote has more power.\n\nAlso interesting how this reads like a 2-sides argument. People from Iowa are very different to Nebraskans, even if they vote majority for the same party. You also ignore that there is a minority of Nebraskans supporting the same ideas as a majority in Brooklyn. None of these groups are monoliths.\n\nUnless there finally is a system allowing for more than the current 2 parties I would argue, that nothing of this even matters. If given a fair chance it might be likely that a majority would support neither democrats nor republicans.\n\nAlso I'm pretty sure you probably live on land that was stolen from native Americans in the past (as that's most of modern America). So by the \"people are connected to the land\" people could reasonably argue for some drastic changes.",

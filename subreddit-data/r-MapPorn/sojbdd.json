The other person has a point in that Carthage was more metropolitan than other civilizations of the time, but there still was an agrarian portion of the population that was Punic. ~350 years after the destruction of Carthage a man named Septimius Severus became Roman emperor. We know for a fact that Severus was at least 1/2 Punic, and spoke the Punic language. There is evidence for the survival of Punic as a language until the 8th century CE almost 1000 years after the destruction of Carthage, even St. Augustine spoke Punic as his native tongue in North Africa during the sixth century",

And the smaller countries (Lesotho, Eswatini, Rwanda, Burundi) do due their size I suppose. But I cannot work out what the countries that are mentioned did that would not include the others. \n\nMoz, Angola and the DRC all had protracted wars, but so did Zimbabwe. They don't speak English as a national language, except South Africa which does get mentioned. Moz and SA drive on the left, Angola and DRC on the right.\n\nPerhaps the British colonies are mentioned as a block, with South Africa made as an exception because of its Dutch links as well as Nelson Mandela. Yeah I think this is the case",

Maybe Guevara, maybe some music (I heard *funk carioca* on some tik tok videos, and of course the famous flute song). But ask anyone to point at Uruguay in a map and I don't think most people would know. Which is weird because our education of History is divided into history of our country + history of europe and their process of colonization that lead us to be what we are today.",

It was a really great class that they tied in with our literature class as well, when we studied Japan in history we also studied japanese literature. It was definitely eye opening and something more schools should do.",

Its not called South America, you probably meant Latin America. \n\nSouth America is anything below Central America.\n\nIf you\u2019re learning about the Aztecs then you\u2019re learning about people in North America, since Mexico is in North America.\n\nI noticed this weird thing where everyone outside of Latin America calls any Spanish speaking country in Latin America, \u201cSouth America\u201d? I don\u2019t know why, since South America is one region of Latin America.\n\nExample: \n\nPerson 1: \u201cOh yeah my friend is from Mexico.\u201d\n\nPerson 2: \u201cWhere is Mexico?\u201d\n\nPerson 1: \u201cOh, it\u2019s in South America.\u201d\n\nIs it something in the education systems in other countries that call any country south of the United States \u201cSouth American\u201d? \n\nBecause if so, do they call countries under Russia \u201cSouth Russian countries\u201d",

Just put the distance you want to see in the \"range.\" It also shows the same circle projected on a globe on the right. You may be amused that Leaflet.js does not, by default, implement true circles, so I had to write my own plug-in to do it (it does Euclidean, flat-plane circles, which look fine when zoomed in but won't work well for ICBM ranges).",

Looking at the ephemeris of where we could pick up transmissions it seemed odd that from the SF bay area Hudson Bay was closer than where I am from in Pennsylvania. We had a map with our station at the center and a circle that showed reception limits. I had bumps because of mountains but was mostly round. A map application that does this should be out there somewhere.",

Historically they were really only used for navigation but I think we can agree that the world map in a child's classroom was not put there to help that child navigate an ocean.\n\nEvery 2d map will have pluses and minuses to it and some people feel navigation just isn't a very useful plus.",

In other projections if you go up you might actually be going northeast or northwest, and not simply North. \n\nThe latitude and longitude lines are always 90 degrees in mercator, which is a trait it preserves on perfect spheres",

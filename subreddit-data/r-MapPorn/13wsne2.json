There's actually been a huge decline in US prison populations, largely because of covid related backlogs in courts.  Some individual states have dramatically cut back their drug related imprisonments.  \n\nNumber I'm seeing is 572 including those awaiting trial and 388 without. I didn't check every country, but for Russia at least their ~300 does include those awaiting trial.\n\nRussia source: https://www.prisonstudies.org/country/russian-federation",

It's na\u00efve and simply wrong to characterise western countries as \"caring about human rights\" abroad. You might as well talk about how Russia cares about the right of peoples to self-determination. Sure they do, when it's in their interest! So\nYes for Crimea, no for Kosovo. And vice versa for the west.\n\nAlso, the reason the West takes a hands off approach to Armenia is because Armenia is a CSTA/EAEU country and Russian ally, and seen as largely a Russian proxy in the region, whereas Azerbaijan is a Turkish ally (the Turks practically view it as an exclave) and therefore NATO ally. And Turkey, also a relatively authoritarian state, is a NATO ally because it controls the bosphorus.\n\nThe diaspora connection and resulting pro-Armenian lobby does complicate the situation somewhat, and make a bit of a dent, but ultimately it just doesn't trump the geopolitics of it, the west is not going to back a Russian ally at Turkey's expense, not in a million years.",

Then China would have 3.7 million prisoners. Divide that by 1.4 billion and China would have 388 prisoners per Capita AKA still about half as many as the US",

Not the case.\n\nThe US has much harsher sentences than a lot of other countries. You hear about stories in Canada and the UK where murderers get 5-10 years in prison. In the US they will automatically get a life sentence or the death penalty for a first degree murder conviction.",

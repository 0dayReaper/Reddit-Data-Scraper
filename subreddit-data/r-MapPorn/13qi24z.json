They were all smoking hash and dealing drugs not just the brown kids. The black kids had it harder than the white kids but I was shocked by the treatment of the North African kids. \n\nIt breeds a lot of resentment and I don\u2019t blame them. Similarly you\u2019ve got white kids in the class announcing that immigrants are causing all the problems in the country, when they\u2019re sitting next to a Moroccan kid. Not a great environment to grow up in. This is coupled with systemic crime and a lack of opportunities. I\u2019d have been screwed. All this leads to a real disrespect of France and the French establishment. \n\nI personally don\u2019t respect how they integrate their migrants. I found it to be a lot more peaceful back home in Manchester and London. There are still problems here but the country is less segregated and more harmonious. France will burn before they have an French Algerian President while we have had an British Indian one without much issue.",

But culturally we are people that tend to keep to ourselves so most of the time no one bothers you in the streets, you might have a homeless person ask you for some money but they\u2019re not going to harass you is you don\u2019t give them anything. \n\nIt might have something to do with assumptions/racism ? So if you assume you will be unsafe you might have a sort of frightened look and that makes you more easily victimized? Idk, I\u2019m not trying to victim blame. I\u2019ve lived in brussels now for a year and a half and I\u2019ve never had any issues, I\u2019ve only once been followed out if a bar by tourists trying to hit on me and my friend when they wouldn\u2019t take a no for a no.

Add to it the natural inclination of the brain to confuse how often X is mentioned with how often it actually happened.   \n\n\nEventually, it led to the current situation where people are convinced that crime is increasingly prevalent, against every rational estimation that shows it decreasing every year.   \n\n\nTL;DR : Fear of crime is linked to how much crime is in the media, not how much there is in the streets.",

We're in public!\"\n\nMe: \"???\"\n\nHer: \"Don't act like you don't know!\"\n\nMe: \"I honestly have no idea what you are talking about.\"\n\nHer: \"Oh, so you think it's okay for you to feel me up in public!?\"\n\nMe: \"Wait, what!?\"\n\nHer: \"On the bus, you were feeling me up under my dress, like the WHOLE time!\"\n\nMe: \"Uhhh...that wasn't me...\"\n\nHer: (she stops dead in her tracks) \"Wha...I can't...AHHHHGH!\"\n\nShe turned on her heels and went straight back to the hotel.

Italy used to be notorious for catcalling (by native Italians) but I never felt unsafe there. There was a huge difference between some guy smiling his best smile, \u201cCiao, bella!\u201d and walking away happily and the aggressive following and shout-whispering by young men in groups in Paris. I stopped going to France without ever having read a single newspaper article about crime there.",

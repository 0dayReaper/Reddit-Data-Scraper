It's not even close.\n\n[There are about 30-40 venomous spider bites a year, but there have been no deaths from spider bites in Australia for almost 50 years because we created highly effective anti-venoms for them in the 80s.](https://australian.museum/learn/animals/spiders/spider-facts/).\n\n[Fatal snake bites are more common in that they do happen, a couple a year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fatal_snake_bites_in_Australia#21st_century) which is more common than the USA which also has a couple of fatal snake bites a year but has more than 10x the population. But still, overall it's very rare.\n\nIt's funny that foreigners focus so much on Australia's supposedly deadly spiders, which don't kill people, and nobody mentions the sharks. We also have a few shark fatalities each year, as well as several non-fatal attacks which range from 'no serious damage' to 'lost a limb'.",

The Katipo (native) and Redback (introduced). Katipo is endangered, hasn't killed anyone since 1901. Redback has only killed 1 person in the past 60 years, but that was an Australian. Both species can be spot from a mile away cause they're little black spiders with a red stripe on the back.\n\nThere's also the white-tailed spider, who can be aggro little fuckers sometimes, but that's more like being stung by a bee. They're a bit more common.\n\nSo yeah, if you hate dangerous animals, come to New Zealand. All we have are birds. Most dangerous creature out there is probably a cow or a wild hog.",

            "comment": "I think Australia\u2019s dangerous fauna is overstated. \n\nLet me clarify. First of all, Australia is a country as well as a *continent.* It is massive and has so many varied ecosystems, from dry desert to scrub, to grazing land, vast sugarcane plantation and other agricultural land, to sub-tropical, alpine, and cloud forest, sub-tropical broadleaf forest, tropical forest, tropical rainforest, marine island ecosystems dominated by migratory seabirds, Tasmania\u2019s unique landscapes, as well as what remains of the Great Barrier Reef, tropical waters, temperate waters, epic swamps, wetlands, brackish estuaries, mangroves, river deltas, tide pools, and border areas where these ecosystems meet. It has urban, suburban, and town/small town landscapes, fairly pastoral parts, and coastline often characterized by vast sand dunes that stretch for thousands of kilometers. I\u2019m sure Australians could add to this list of ecosystems which, in and of themselves, should be expected to have tremendous biodiversity. \n\nBecause most of Australia\u2019s climate is quite harsh for human habitation, the vast majority of the population are concentrated in a few pockets where venomous animals do co-exist with humans, but in relatively small numbers compared to the areas of the country that are largely uninhabited. There are relatively few humans living in the range of the Inland Taipan or Saltwater Crocodile, or Box Jelly, etc. If you live in the five or six largest metro areas of Australia (which probably encompasses close to 90% of its total population), you probably face a few common venomous animals in your region that you grow up around and therefore know how to identify, avoid, and be safe around. Like the Sydney Funnel Web Spider or Eastern Brown Snake.\n\nFinally, there are the statistics. Do you have any idea how many people die from snakebite alone in India every year? It\u2019s in the tens of thousands. That does not count the tens of thousands more who lose digits, hands, feet, limbs, or develop organ failure and lifelong kidney disease, heart trouble, etc. from these encounters. Australia has quite a few more venomous creatures (even just snakes) than India, but it is extremely high on the human development index by comparison, has excellent access to healthcare, antivenin, and treatment for things like Irakandji syndrome, and so on. Very few people - relatively speaking - die from encounters with venomous and dangerous animals in Australia each year. \n\nSo for those people who always look at Australia\u2019s dangerous fauna and say \u201cthanks, but no thanks,\u201d if you moved there, you are likely to go years without anything more than a huntsman spider posting up in a corner of your ceiling, minding its own business, keeping your room pest free. They aren\u2019t dangerous to humans and don\u2019t really leave their webs either. \n\nSo, Australia\u2019s got the numbers, but the danger is pretty low for the average resident.",

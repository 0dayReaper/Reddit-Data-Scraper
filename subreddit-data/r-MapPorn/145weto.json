In this case, all French-based Creoles are counted as \"French Creole\". In New York City this is primarily Haitian Creole, but the same term is used for Louisianans, Martinicans, etc.\n\nThere's a similar problem with designations like \"Chinese\" or \"Arabic\", in the sense that two New Yorkers who are identified here as speaking the \"same language\" wouldn't actually be able to understand each other. A proper Chinese languages map of New York City would probably be really cool, since different waves of immigrants have come from regions speaking different \"dialects\", but this is the data we have.\n\nSo, the census data is not ideal from a linguistic point of view. But the flip side is that the US Census is the only organization that attempts to poll literally every resident of the US, so in other ways it may be more complete.",

Today there's 800,000 russian speaking people in NYC (with about 500,000 in brooklyn), by far the largest concentration of russian speaking people outside of eastern europe. \n\nThis map actually kind of doesn't really show the full extent of how widespread russian-speaking people are in brooklyn. They are very common in midwood, gravesend, bay ridge, bensonhurst, kensington, ditmas park etcc as well, even if not the majority.",

Rural towns started emptying in the 1950s and 60s. Many citizens left for places like Germany, Belgium, France, and Canada. However, chain migration to the United States led to residual immigration to places like the New York area through the 1980s. Everyone seemed to have a relative in America who would share their home, help them get a job, etc. Many of these people only learned Italian in school. Sicilian was their 1st language and the language of the home. It continues to be that way for many, both in Sicily and abroad. While every generation since the 1970s has developed a better command of Italian than the generation before, the Sicilian communities in places like New York or Hamilton, Canada are more bilingual in English and are not using Italian as their primary language. They will consume Italian-language media because that\u2019s all that exists. They will use Italian for government purposes back home or to deal with the airlines. However, they will get off the phone and speak to their spouses and children in Sicilian. The lack of acceptance of regional languages in Italy is why everything gets lumped as \u201cItalian,\u201d when they are all completely different languages.",

So the transition here is a much more recent thing. I'm super curious to learn more about who the early Japanese restaurant pioneers were, and how and when much of the industry came to be run by folks from other Asian nations.\n\nI will say that for the highest-end Japanese places here, the chefs are often still Japan-born or of Japanese descent, [such as Sushi Yasuda](https://sushiyasuda.com/restaurant.html).",

While Italians were a large group in the past, it's a bit of a Hollywood trope that all of Brooklyn is Italian.\n\nItalians, like other European groups, have stopped coming in large numbers by the 1980s. Like other European groups, they're just white Americans now, often intermarries with other Europeans, often 2nd/3rd/4th generation, and often moved to the suburbs.  The pockets of Italian speakers that still exist are elderly immigrants from Italy that arrived *by* the 1970s, or their American-born children that can speak some level of Italian or dialect.",

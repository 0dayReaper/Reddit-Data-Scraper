It's a style that he spent many years developing and working his way up to.",

For example, here is a [still life](https://collections.artsmia.org/art/4504/irises-piet-mondrian) by him, and you can see how he starts to devolve art into it's fundamental colors and shapes. Even this painting shows his interest in the flatness of painting as there is very little dimension in the flowers and the flatness of the table basically causes it to blend with the background.",

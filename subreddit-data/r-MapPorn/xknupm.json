They were annexed during WWII and never returned to China unlike everything else, due to a loophole in the treaty they signed when returning stolen land (Japan claims they annexed the islands in a seperated incident). Their claim wasn't disputed until the 70's because the islands were considered valueless, but now China wants them back because they massively extend the ocean that falls under Japan's control. Interestingly, Taiwan also claims ownership of those islands, and probably has the best claim from a legal standpoint, though they have no means of enforcing it.",

Post-WWII, when Japanese Imperial conquests (including those from the first Sino-Japanese War) were returned, they mostly used the old treaties as a basis, but did not explicitly return the Senkaku/Diaoyu, as those hadn't been part of the treaty. America had de facto control, and then returned them to Japan (since China was Communist) in 1971 along with Okinawa.\n\nChina (both the People's Republic, the mainland, and the Republic of China, Taiwan) do not recognize this, as they see it as having been seized from China alongside Taiwan, and it being a theft abetted by America, and that the timing of the annexation proves it was not an island owned by Japan, but a Chinese territory that was a victim of Japanese imperial expansion.",

Nobody cared about those islands until the 1971 UN report that claimed the potential for undersea oil reserves there... prior to that, ROC maps even labeled them as the Senkaku Islands and as part of Japan.\n\nJapan and Taiwan however have been able to work together on the issue for the most part. There is a shared resource and patrol agreement in place, which allows the Taiwanese Coast Guard and fishermen into the area.\n\nAlso local opinion is very mixed on it... Former Taiwanese President Lee Teng Hui was somewhat famous for going to Japan and declaring those islands as being Japanese (saying so while speaking Japanese even): https://thediplomat.com/2015/07/taiwans-former-president-causes-controversy-in-japan/",

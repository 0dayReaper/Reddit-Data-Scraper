Im guessing the author made educated guesses based on the census data, or possibly referred to other maps/sources.",

And from my point if view, as far as I remember th history and the census datas from this time, the map is very correct. At this time, the people were divided by the languge they spoke and the montenegrins were speaking \"serbian\" at this time. As it was said. this huge \"serbian\" dominated area is mostly uninhabited.... look at other maps from tis time ....",

You put ingots which were not good before my messenger (Sit-Sin) and said: \"If you want to take them, take them; if you do not want to take them, go away!\"  What do you take me for, that you treat somebody like me with such contempt? I have sent as messengers gentlemen like ourselves to collect the bag with my money (deposited with you) but you have treated me with contempt by sending them back to me empty-handed several times, and that through enemy territory. Is there anyone among the merchants who trade with Telmun who has treated me in this way? You alone treat my messenger with contempt! On account of that one (trifling) mina of silver which I owe(?) you, you feel free to speak in such a way, while I have given to the palace on your behalf 1,080 pounds of copper, and \u0160umi-abum has likewise given 1,080 pounds of copper, apart from what we both have had written on a sealed tablet to be kept in the temple of Shamash.  How have you treated me for that copper? You have withheld my money bag from me in enemy territory; it is now up to you to restore (my money) to me in full.  Take cognizance that (from now on) I will not accept here any copper from you that is not of fine quality. I shall (from now on) select and take the ingots individually in my own yard, and I shall exercise against you my right of rejection because you have treated me with contempt.",

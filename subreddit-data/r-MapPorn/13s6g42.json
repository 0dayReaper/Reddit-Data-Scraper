Most big crops need big industries of scale to compete with foreign farms. Thats why it evolved this way.\n\nI dont know if there are interesting alternatives except energy-intensive glass-culture. Not that I\u00b4m against decreasing the livestock, it needs to be controlled because the nitrogen is killing our nature, but alternatives should be provided.",

They were successful to an extent but did not meet the level that would become catastrofic for the ground and closeby nature. They did this mostly with technological advances. Now those advances stopped following the downwards trend years ago.\n\n2, It is not at all about global emissions. It is about the health of the ground and local nature. Yes it has a sizable impact on the global emissions but not major relative to the world.",

They feed countless countries around them that don't have the same amount of arable land or food production. \n\nSurely it makes sense to innovate so there isn't a negative polluting effect? The reason the dutch do greenhouse agriculture and stuff so much better is because of the insane amounts of money the govt has poured into r&amp;d. Granted this map is about livestock, but the comparative advantage the dutch have surely means they should help livestock farmers transition to greenhouses instead of just stripping them of their land and livelihood?",

Thank god there are now EU rules which have to be followed or else there will be massive fines, which means the government is finally trying to tackle this issue. \n\nBig problem however is that two of the four coalition parties (VVD (RENEW) and CDA (PPE)) still don't want to take the measures which are needed: forcibly buy out the highest polluting farmers, while the other two coalition parties (D66 (RENEW and CU (PPE) want to adhere to the EU's biodiversity rules. This will probably results in another government crisis which will lead to the collapse of the coalition.",

It is helpful to know that the network chart (bottom left) and the grid-with-dots (bottom centre) show the exact same thing, so if you understand one of them, you can ignore the other.\n\nI find the grid chart to be easier to understand: The major legal models are listed along the left hand side, and the bottom represents hybrid or combination systems, with the dots above each hybrid indicating which of the major legal models influenced the creation of that particular hybrid system. Then each of the legal systems (both the major models and the hybrids) is assigned its own colour, and map is painted in accordance to what legal system is in place in each country/sub national entity. The letter codes (listed to the right of the grid chart) add additional information in some countries.\n\nFor example: Canada is red, which means it has a conventional Common Law system (Common Law being one of the major legal models, listed on the left of the chart), except for Quebec, which has a purple hybrid system. If we find the purple hybrid on the bottom of the chart, we can see that its system is a combination of Common Law and Civil Law principles. The letter \"N\" in Quebec also tells us that its Civil Law component specifically comes from the Napoleonic Law.",

Just a few examples. \n\nI bet almost every legal system has some elements of customary law, not only those coloured in yellow here. Also it is not clear why angloamerican common law is not just coloured yellow, I think they are prime example of legal systems with huge elements of customary law.\n\nMany countries adopted for example the German civil code as a basis for their civil law, but they often did it before the huge number of EU legislation was adopted in the German civil code. Can we still say that those legal systems are related?",

First by Napoleon then by BGB and other countries copying it.\n\nFor example Poland is mixed as we pretty much copied Swiss civil law in 1930s which was a mix of both systems. Polish Civil Code has the same \"bee rule\" as German BGB. Japan straightway copied BGB and added local customary elements which were to hard to remove. \n\nEven if systems are somehow connected you can still see minor differences even within single countries. In Poland appeals practice is different in Northern Poland (longest Germans influence) and Center Poland (Russian partition and less formulaic approach). Legal education is as much know how as much university education and know how tends to stick to tradition.",

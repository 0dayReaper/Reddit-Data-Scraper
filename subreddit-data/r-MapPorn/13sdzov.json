Unsurprisingly, this was the breakthrough moment for the Labour Party. The 1928 act made suffrage conditions equal for men and women. And the UK was already arguably the most democratic major country in Europe, with the possible exception of the French Third Republic--the share of eligible voters was similar in both countries, but turnout in the UK was usually higher, and political rights were stronger than in France. The early Third Republic (really until the 1890s) was largely preoccupied with the question of whether or not to reinstate the monarchy.",

The Bolsheviks agreed to a fair election, then overturned the results when they came in second to SR. I wouldn't call that democracy. There was a window of opportunity for a true socialist democracy there, but they didn't take it.\n\nSocialist-led governments had already been elected in France and Italy by then, and had actually gotten to the point of governing.",

Even threatening to use Russian force against their detractors and moving the meeting place of the Parliament to Norrk\u00f6ping instead of Stockholm, because it would be easier for Russian forces to come. \n\nThis state of the Parliament led to the eventual self coup by king Gustav III who reestablished an absolute monarchy which lasted until his son lost Finland to Russia in the Finnish war.",

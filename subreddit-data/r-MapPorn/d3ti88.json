I'm imagining a post-global-warming doomsday scenario where only the northern half of the continental US is inhabitable, the grain plains are basically desert, and the Olympic peninsula has a tropical rainforest instead of temperate. Florida and the Eastern seaboard basically cease to exist, the biggest cities are Minneapolis, Fargo, Omaha, Spokane, Denver, and SLC, and there are just ghost town desert outposts in Phoenix and San Antonio. DC has flooded, leaving the government to take up residence the place they think is safest: a new planned city near Fairbanks. High seawalls/levees are built to protect Anchorage, turning it into the New Orleans of the north, and becomes the center of trade of the \"new republic\". \n\nThere is an ongoing war with Canada for the best farmable land on the continent: the plains near Edmonton and Calgary. The Central valley in California can barely produce enough for what's left of the continental US, and it's all very warm weather crops. We have turned to fishing as our primary source of sustenance, having hunted the moose and bear in Alaska to extinction. As the world collapses, we retreat to older and older needs, giving up on new technology except that which improves crop yield, and money is nearly worthless, overtaken by a simplistic bartering system for food.",

Even if it was a White state it would have been ripe for invasion by a country like Japan and it's unlikely that the US would want to get involved in a war with Japan just because some Russian towns were attacked to the far North. Fighting a frozen war in a foreign land over 50,000 or so people who don't even speak English would not have been popular with the US.",

We don't really have much of that here (Fairbanks). \n\nTrader Joe's is awesome though.",

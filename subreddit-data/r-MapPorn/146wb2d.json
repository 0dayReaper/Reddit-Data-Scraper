And it's true that many of the safest are white suburbs. But that's not a sufficient explanation for this entire map. After all, a lot of the southern counties are far from being the blackest in their respective states. Why is 60% white Covington County Mississippi more dangerous than 70% black Sharkey County, if race is the only relevant factor here?",

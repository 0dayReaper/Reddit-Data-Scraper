In those post-colonial groups, vast majority has \"some\" hispanic ancestry. Additionally you should add the roughly 40% descendant of XIX-XX century transoceanic mass migration, from which 33.4% of the finally settled were spaniards according 1947 census AND the mixing with other origins since then... There is no way that less than 75-80% of argentine population would have at least one hispanic ancestor despite general share of hispanic ancestry could be just 40% or so.\n\nIt's the same case with bolivians and native american ancestry. Only 40% of bolivians is part of a native american group currently, with a slightly higher percentage considering themselves mixed, but over 70% of the general bolivian ancestry is native american according genetics and more than 90% of all bolivians have at least \"some\" native american ancestry independently of how high is the share in each individual.",

There's stories of defected NK's temporarily jumping back over the wall on election day, so that the regime doesn't suspect they're missing and retaliate on the family members left behind.",

That isn't hard to accomplish, it's when you start with 62% to make it look natural and 8 opposition politicians that your fixers start making dumb mistakes like having a 102% of people voting in the election. The trick is to make it stupid simple so you have deniability and the ability to fix it in your favor with simple numbers. Remember, there is usually a lot of people involved in fixing an election, and all you need is one mistake for everyone to realize what a freud you are, and from the disillusion to open rebellion its merely a foreign armament supply away. Isn't it amazing how all these rebellions always chance upon old Soviet equipment?",

[How elections work in countries like North Korea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFjh8lBB6T4) is that you're given a pre-filled ballot which you drop into the ballot box. But you're totally allowed to vote for someone else, you simply enter a highly-conspicuous designated booth at your polling center, write in whatever name you want, and then place that in the ballot box.\n\nDon't worry though, voting for someone other than the official candidate definitely won't result in the secret police coming after you. And it's so nice of you to volunteer to only receive half rations, you're really helping to keep North Korea strong.",

Germany has the largest democratic lower house in the world, it would seem. Particularly surprising given that Germany is a federation so you've got all those state legislatures as well.\n\nSmallest are:\n\n* Vatican City (LOL): 7 seats\n* St. Lucia: 11 seats\n* Belize: 12 seats\n* Grenada: 13 seats\n* Palau: 13 seats\n\nLooking at it *per population*, the *relatively* smallest are:\n\n* India: 1 seat per 2,192,000 people\n* USA: 1 seat per 723,000\n* Pakistan: 1 seat per 537,000\n* Indonesia: 1 seat per 467,000\n* Bangladesh: 1 seat per 467,000\n\nAnd *relatively* largest are again all microstates: Vatican, Nauru, San Marino, Tuvalu, Palau. Nauru has one MP for every 521 citizens!\n\nThe Bundestag has one seat per 128,500 citizens, roughly on par with the lower houses of Spain, Malaysia and South Africa.\n\nNorth Korea's lower house has one seat per 36,400 people.",

            "comment": "Temesv\u00e1r was not a part of Romania in 1775. \n\nThe city was originally a part of the Hungarian Kingdom but ruled by the Turkish Ottoman Empire after the fall of the Hungarian Kingdom. Unlike two Romanian vassals of the Ottoman Empire, Wallachia and Moldavia, the city of Temesv\u00e1r was ruled directly from Constatinople as a part of Banat region from 1552-1716.\n\nTemesv\u00e1r, as its name indicates was never culturally, economically of politically was Romanian.\n\nUnfortunately, the city was given to Romania after WW1 as war reparation whose citizens believe Timisoara have been an ancient Romanian city but unaware of the origin of the name Timisoara.\n\nI visited Temesv\u00e1r once. The city was quite different than other Romanian cities in the east culturally and architecturally but it was very similar to Hungarian cities.",

There is no evidence for such a claim expect for the nickname of one of the members of the family. The father of this member also had Cuman Turkic nicknames. Does this make Hunyadi's Cuman Kipchaks?\n\nTimisoara is in Banat which is in the Pannonian Plateau. Transylvania, which was also a historically Hungarian land, is mountainous.",

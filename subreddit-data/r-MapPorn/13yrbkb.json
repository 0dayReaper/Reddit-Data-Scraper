                    "comment": "The Brittonic areas have Ogham Stones because they were settled by Irish people during the early middle ages. Especially south Wales, where Irish warlords established the kingdoms of Dyfed and Brycheiniog. It's around that time that they first appear in Wales and Cornwall. I don't think it was a native Briton practice or anything. Though some of the stones in Wales are bilingual, written in both Irish and Brittonic.\n\nThere are different theories about its ultimate origin. One theory is that it was a cypher designed to keep communications secret from the Romans. Another is that it was invented by early Irish Christians, who found the Latin alphabet wasn't really suited to writing Irish and came up with Ogham as an better script for it. A less widely accepted theory is that Ogham actually descends from the hand signals of Gaulish Druids in the Alps.\n\nWe don't know exactly where they come from, but they're strongly associated with an early medieval Irish presence.",

But it has since been lost, and no one ever created a drawing of it or translated its inscription, so we don't know what it said. All we know is that it was carved into a Roman millstone, and found near a Roman well. \n\nThat's similar to the other one found further south in England, The Silchester Ogham Stone, which was carved into a sandstone pillar of Roman make, and dates to the late 3rd or 4th century. This one was found inside a Roman well. It's still around, but it's damaged. All se can make of the inscription is \"Ebicatus, son of the tribe of\". \n\nThese two stones in England are interesting because most are carved into natural rock, but here both are carved into objects leftover from Roman usage, and both were found in or near Roman-era wells.",

            "comment": "Definitely a very interesting map! I usually heard some stories but never really had visual data on these. It shows one of the multiple conflicts that (re-)surged when Suharto's downfall created a short-term power vacuum in the country: one that was filled up by new presidents but with the sudden end of Suharto's tight grip, the new ones couldn't solve the problems overnight. \n\nThe more stable the democracy became and the more the economic downturn was reversed, the less of these conflicts remained. Timtim (Timor-Leste) being released, the Aceh conflict settled, Maluku conflicts settled, and those with ethnic Chinese people as well. \n\nWhat remains currently is parts of Papua. And of course there are a few other deep-lying tensions that for now remain under the surface. It's not easy to bring and keep together such a massive nation with such diverse demographics.",

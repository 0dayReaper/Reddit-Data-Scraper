There's going to be a big bulge between mean BMI and \"dead from malnutrition\". A malnourished population will have narrow SDs because of this, and as the population becomes less malnourished, the bands will widen and the BMI that corresponds to obese will increase - so is a BMI of 25 healthy or unhealthy? Well, this system may label it as unhealthy one year and healthy the next year. \n\nAlso, using the median like this, assumes that the median is healthy, and not over or underweight. Childhood malnourishment is a big problem globally and tends to be worse in the most populous places.\n\nBut the next question is... What is a better solution?\n\nBMI is a surrogate measurement tbh. What would be more interesting is obesity-related health problems and their prevalence - eg type 2 diabetes in childhood.",

Either a map is utterly perfect or it's trash. \n\nThe WHO uses reference data of median BMI from 1977 and the countries are compared against that, as noted in another person's comment. Is it perfect? No. But all countries are being compared to the same data and we can still recognize trends. The map still shows us that the Gulf Arab states, especially Kuwait and Qatar, have a major childhood obesity problem. BMI is also not a perfect measurement, but in the aggregate it is useful to show general trends and population differences. Like I doubt that Kuwait just has 100,000 underage bodybuilders throwing off the BMI data.",

With a total population of 25.39 million that year, that means there were 3.52 million people 19 and under. Using the 8.5% rate of childhood obesity, that means 299,120 North Korean children were obese.\n\nWith a birth rate of 1.87 kids per woman, you're looking at a total of 559,354 government officials, which is 2.20% of the population. I don't think that makes it super likely to be the reason behind an 8.5% childhood obesity rate.\n\nThe number of elites that would have to have enough children to even affect the rate by a percent or 2 is super substantial. Are there a number of people who are more privileged than the rest on North Korea? Probably, but that number is likely in the thousands, not hundreds of thousands.",

All served at one time. And if they can\u2019t afford everything I mentioned, no worries! They\u2019ll grab a huge pot the size of a table and serve one mega dish just for you. You really come close to fighting them to be excused because they take food offerings so seriously. You\u2019re seen as an especially nice person if you feed people but they also like insisting that you eat more lol\n\nThere\u2019s memes about this amongst Arabians: a western guy arrives skinny, leaves overweight",

One common problem with newly married couples is that neither of them ever had to do any household chores whatsoever, so they argue or neglect them or don't do them well.\n\nAnother symptom is there's a fair amount of fat kids because they get whatever they want, and what a lot of kids want is good food.",

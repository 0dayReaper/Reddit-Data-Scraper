The Democratic Party supported FDR\u2019s liberal policies, but many of the conservative Southern Democrats did not. These Southern Dixiecrats would form an unofficial coalition with the conservative Republican Party members in order to block FDR\u2019s New Deal policies. This conservative coalition would dominate congress during not only FDR\u2019s presidency, but also Truman\u2019s, Eisenhower\u2019s and Kennedy\u2019s. Democrats still dominated in the house for many decades, eventually losing the House in 1994 during the \u201cRepublican Revolution\u201d.",

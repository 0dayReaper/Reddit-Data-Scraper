    "postText": "Israel is one of the only nations in the world that entered the 21st century with more trees than it had 100 years ago. Since its inception, Israel has been devoted to sustainable forest management and afforestation, planting trees mostly in areas with arid and semi-arid climates.\nKeren Kayemet, the Jewish National Fundm was founded in 1901 to purchase land for Jewish agricultural communities, as well as to carry out development, reclamation and afforestation projects in the Land of Israel. By the time Israel became independent in 1948, the JNF had planted about 4.5 million trees on the country's rocky hillsides.\nToday over 200 million trees in forests and woodlands covering some 300,000 acres provide Israelis with a wide range of opportunities for outdoor recreation and appreciation of nature.\n\n \n\ud83c\udf32\ud83c\udf32\ud83c\udf32\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf34\ud83c\udf34\ud83c\udf34",

Problem solved. What is the use of crying with no power. Justice does not hold without power. \n3. The third article did not make sense with respect to the original post. Loss of trees is a negative right and that too 800 years old olive trees right, but the original map was for forest increase. It seems rather than talking about tress, you are talking about israeli settlement action. But then hey it is Reddit, you can post what ever you want just like I just did.",

Its a natural process, but it doesnt need to start with non natives.\n\nAn imbalance of nonnatives will stunt succession.\n\nBeing that this is an arid mediteranean climate, an increase of trees means an ecological imbalane. I suspect heavy irrigation and other adverse environmental conditions.\n\nTrees arent always \"good\", especially in arid areas.",

I work as a freight conductor and I have waited for hundreds upon hundreds of hours for Amtrak and if we cause them to have to slow down even a little the dispatcher gets asked why. It's not uncommon to sit in a siding for 3 or 4 hours waiting for them. A few years ago when they were having such delays it was during the peaks of the Bakken oil boom. They were literally running out of places to put trains.\n\nAs to the speed, hi-speed trans-continental service really isn't on the table for the US in the near future. You would have to build a completely independent line since the current routes are already in heavy use and simply not built for speeds over what is currently run. Topography plays a big part in certain areas, mainly through the rocky mountains, and the viable routes through those mountains are already occupied.",

This has never happened in the history of Amtrak, so the net result is that there are no consequences for freight trains ignoring the rules. Some operators are worse than others. Amtrak puts out a scorecard every year about how good hosts are about respecting the rules, but the naming and shaming is really all they can do. \n\nHere's 2019's: https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/corporate/HostRailroadReports/Amtrak-2019-Host-Railroad-Report-Card-FAQs.pdf",

There was a law (guideline maybe) that the RR's used to be fined based on delays but that was overturned. \n\nMy father spent 40 years as a trackman and he always had to clear his track and time well before Amtrak got close to ensure no delays, and I've been a Trainman for 8 and we get shoved out of the way all the time. I can count the number of times that my train got priority over Amtrak on one hand and most of those were when they were running ahead of schedule so a quick dip into a siding doesn't hurt them.\n\nAlso remember that if they can't make a good meet, ie the freight train can't be fully into a siding and clear of the track, it is often much much faster for everyone involved if amtrak takes the siding and the freight holds the main. Freight trains have to slow way down when turning into a siding and have to start slowing down far earlier than amtrak does. \n\nAmtrak makes our run in 4.5 hours and it routinely takes me 12 on a freight train.",

Still, this isn't a binary thing - trains and planes can share a market over the same routes. People will choose the train at the expense of planes (i expect even more so with climate conciseness increasing - train holidays are becoming very popular in Europe) and any route will impact aviation. Build it and they will come.",

You can extend services all you want but it's not going to be considered a viable form of transportation for most people if it's more expensive than taking a car. Here in Vermont we've got two Amtrak lines, and one of them is about to complete a major expansion. I'd be happy to pay like $20 more in state taxes a year if it meant minimum wage workers could ride the train from Burlington to New York or Montpelier to Boston at a cost they could actually afford.",

There are many benefits to trains (long-term economic, environmental, etc.). There is also a difference between short and long distance trips to consider. However in its current state, Amtrak is ridiculously slow outside of the Northeast. Certainly much slower and often more expensive than taking an airplane anywhere.\n\nExample #1: Long distance trip. New York to Los Angeles. As of this post, a flight will cost ~$120 and take roughly six and a half hours. Amtrak will cost ~$250 and take roughly sixty four hours. Rail needs a lot of work in order to become economically competitive and viable compared to flying.\n\nExample #2: Short distance trip. New York to Boston. As of this post, a flight will cost ~$55 and take roughly an hour and a half. Amtrak will cost ~$45 and take roughly four and a half hours. Rail is doing better here as an economically competitive and viable option but still lags behind flying in my opinion.",

Improving rail reliability in the BosWash corridor, the Texas Triangle and the California coast as well as the many other large metro areas within that distance range should be top priority if we actually want to reduce carbon emissions and congestion and improve transport equity.

            "comment": "For those with limited rail knowledge reading this map:\n\nRail is really only competitive when it can offer conveniences that other modes cannot. \n\nFor example traveling by plane requires padding your journey by significant margins in order to account for all the ancillary activities (getting to/from airports, security, etc.) A two hour flight is probably a five hour time commitment. However, the amount of time padding needed is independent of the flight time. The advantage tips towards flight for longer journeys. \n\nTraveling by car has the benefit of taking you just about anywhere you want, at a moments notice, with no upfront cost, but it requires effort by the traveler. You cannot rest and be on the move at the same time. The advantage tips towards roads for short journeys (&lt;2.5 hours).\n\nWhere train travel really shines is on journeys of &lt;6 hours during the day, or &lt;12 hours overnight, to destinations where travel **without a car** can be easily facilitated. \n\nTake \u201cChicago-Louisville-Nashville-Atlanta\u201d as an example; a route that someone suggested as being an obvious oversight. That\u2019s probably a good 17-20 hours using tracks that already exist. The vast majority of Americans are ***not*** going to spend 18 hours on a train when they could spend 3 hours on a plane, and maybe 5-5.5 hours total door-to-door.",

I doubt that this could be completed by 2035 and kept both up to expectations and standards and within budget.\n\nFurthermore, I worry about how much it will cost people to use the service. This is the USA and Amtrak is a profit-driven, subsidized organization. If kept private, I think that could lead to a lack of users and other general issues.

They also address many of those concerns in the PDF.\n\nI agree that Amtrak needs to be a division of the USDOT instead of a government-owned corporation, but it's honestly very unfair to compare it to the British Rail privatization efforts. Amtrak is not a fully private entity. It's much better to compare it to USPS -- the United States Government owns nearly all of Amtrak's assets, despite it being managed as a for-profit corporation.\n\nI understand that there are a lot of concerns, but let's be honest, the U.S. and Canada have been starved for good, comprehensive rail transit for decades. This is a long overdue start, so I'm hesitant to criticize it.\n\nA lot of it actually looks really good and some of the stuff mentioned (like increasing frequency and adjusting timetables, as well as giving passengers priority over freight) could be done overnight with the requisite funding.",

Especially pick up games, and especially outdoors.\n\nThe NBA guys make it look graceful but when you\u2019re playing with a bunch of casual players there\u2019s A LOT of unintended contact because the game moves so fast and people are out of position or don\u2019t realize what\u2019s happening fast enough. Also, defense in the paint becomes a ton of elbows and knees flying everywhere and dudes flailing around in the air together coming from different angles.\n\nAlso, NBA players can pretty well predict teammates and opponents movements because 1. they have thousands of hours of repetition 2. they have defensive schemes and cohesiveness with their team so they know where everyone is going to be and 3. they study the tendencies of other players and play against them fairly regularly.\n\nWhen you throw a bunch of guys of varying athleticism and playing experience on a court together, no one really knows where anyone is going to be and a lot of guys all just go for the ball at the same time. \n\nYou\u2019ve essentially got 6-10 guys running full speed, stopping and jumping towards the same point (the ball/the basket) at all times. It\u2019s extremely physical. Even NBA is physical and it\u2019s just hard to tell because the guys are so big and the game moves so fast, but especially pickup ball. Most people that don\u2019t play don\u2019t think of bball like that.\n\nEdit: it\u2019s also on hardwood or concrete instead of grass like other fast and physical sports. Ups the consequences significantly.",

Dolgors\u00fcrengiin Dagvadorj was into Mongolian wrestling and became interested in sumo as an exchange student. He excelled and became the highest ranked, a very difficult task. He changed his name to  Asash\u014dry\u016b Akinori per sumo culture (even the Japanese ones take a ring and sometimes legal name). Thereafter, the sport became dominated by Mongolian born, 4/5 yokuzuna since have been Mongolian. There have also been Polynesian ones though.\n\nHe's pretty controversial though.",

Skiing is becoming increasingly a thing for elites, seeing as the prices have been rising astronomically in the last few years. Ski resorts are getting bigger and bigger and more exclusive (all while taking on huge debts for new investments). A week long skiing holiday for a family of 4 is hella expensive. You can spend much less money and go somewhere south.\n\nAlso, the snow situation is becoming more and more insecure each year due to climate change.\n\nSooner or later the house of cards that the tourist associations in Tyrol and Salzburg have built over the past decades will crash down.",

An English professor from the US named Horace Wilson was hired for that role - he introduced baseball to his students as a way to get them physical exercise\n\nThough he left Japan not too long after that, the tradition of baseball as a school game spread, and was accelerated in the 1890s after some Japanese student teams played and defeated some foreign student teams, which got significant national press. Part of the reason it grew in popularity was that it was a relatively accessible sport - the average person couldn't participate in other popular Japanese sports like sumo wrestling or horse racing. It was the first sport to be played widely in the new model of universal education, and lots of people playing a sport usually means lots of fans of the sport\n\nDuring the 1910s-1930s, the first inklings of a professional league began along with the rise in mass media. American professional teams (including Negro League teams) toured Japan and embarrassed amateur Japanese teams. This led to the creation of the first Japanese professional league in the 30s - to emphasize that media connection, the first and oldest Japanese professional team was owned by a newspaper mogul, the owner of the Yomuri Shimbum, one of Japan's largest newspapers\n\nAfter WW2, the sport found favor among American occupation authorities and troops, in addition to the Japanese public. Unusually compared to  American sports, Japanese baseball teams are largely owned by corporations, and saw the teams as great ways to do advertising, which put a lot of money behind the sport and ensured it would be the biggest sport in Japan",

Or the sport with the highest TV viewership? National team or club teams? Or is it the sport that the most people play themselves?\nNot very many countries will answer the same sport for all these questions.\n\nEdit:\n\n(1) I see football/soccer would be the answer regardless of the definition in many countries. Still we need a better definition to answer the question for many other countries.\n\n(2) Guys, I think Archery is for Bhutan (look for the small yellow country between India and China) and Australia is understandably labeled Australian Football.

This can be a complex question to answer. While some countries have sports that are clearly popular \u2014 judging by TV viewership or other metrics \u2014 it\u2019s sometimes difficult to quantify. That is to say, some people might disagree on what the most popular sport in a country is. Indonesia, for example, is most successful at badminton, but its most popular spectator sport is association football. In any case, we did our best to find the most popular sports in every country.\"\n\nFrom here: [https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/most-popular-sports-by-country](https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/most-popular-sports-by-country) \\*\n\n\\*The \"World Population Review\" cited in the map takes its data three different sources, with Babbel being the most recent one.\n\nEdit:\n\nThe second sourced used for this map, [this](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/82112-226-countries-cant-be-wrong), doesn't explain how it got its results either.\n\nFor the last source, [this](https://mostpopularsports.net/by-country), either I couldn't find how they explained their results, or they didn't explain them.",

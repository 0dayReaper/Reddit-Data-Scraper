Like you see a dark blue region and assume it's mostly old people, but it can just be the \"largest age group\" by a thin margin and there may also be many children here. I'd stick with average / median to compare aging in different regions.",

Don\u2019t underestimate the power that a housing market that is when put in context of the entire island is far less fucked can have on the birth rates and in keeping young people in the area, most of whom will go on to have children. \n\nhttps://www.nisra.gov.uk/sites/nisra.gov.uk/files/publications/live_births_1887_2021%20-%20COMPLETE.xlsx\n\nThe demographic collapse seen in the rest of Western Europe hasn\u2019t really happened on the island of Ireland. The total amount of births in the 2010\u2019s matching several years in the 1910s, 1920\u2019s and even coming close to the baby boom in post war welfare state NI. \n\nThe same trend can be seen in the republic, with a sharper decline in recent years. I can\u2019t prove this but I\u2019d argue that this is due to the rental and housing market down here as opposed to what is seen in Northern Ireland and especially west of the Bann.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why Northern Ireland, a country set up to never even entertain a nationalist majority, now has a majority of people who while may not be nationalist or Catholic, come from a nationalist or catholic background. \n\nThe lobsided employment in NI can also account for the difference between east and west NI but I\u2019ve no source for this so again just me spitballing.\n\nTLDR: Catholics pump out babas and the conditions in traditionally nationalist areas are more attractive to raising a family in the current context.",

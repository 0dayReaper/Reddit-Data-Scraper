The province of Hatay, on the Turkish border, is shown on Syrian territory, reflecting ongoing disputes over claims on Hatay beginning after the end of the First World War. Similarly, Israel is designated \"Palestine\" in the Palestinian territories.",

So it doesn't explain why all arab countries (and sub-saharian african countries : ps they are not arab), most countries in Asia and many in South America are facing challenges establishing and maintaining a ''democratic'' regime. There must be some other predominan factor than the ''intrinsic'' trend you can't prove in countries like Tunisia Egypt, Saudi Arabia ...",

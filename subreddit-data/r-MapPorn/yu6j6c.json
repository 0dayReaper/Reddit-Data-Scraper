Are those also Kurdish separatists or is that the work of al-Qaeda and ISIS?\n\nKurdish separatists are responsible for most of them. Radical Islamists like Al Qaeda, ISIS, Hezbollah are responsible for some. Communists are responsible for older attacks. And some were done by the MIT, Turkish intelligence.\r  \n\r  \nWe know that MIT involved many bloody attacks to make others scapegoat. They worked for many parties' interests: sometimes government, sometimes Turkish Armed Forces and sometimes USA (under Operation Gladio).",

Investigators believed that the fuselage, with Vulovi\u0107 pinned inside, landed at an angle in a heavily wooded and snow-covered mountainside, which cushioned the impact. Vulovi\u0107's physicians concluded that her history of low blood pressure caused her to pass out quickly after the cabin depressurized and kept her heart from bursting on impact.",

The blast and a resulting fire destroyed the office and killed 29-year-old Henrik Christensen. It has been presumed to be a political attack, but no one has been convicted. Theories concerned the possibility that the victim was killed by right-wing opponents, by a bomb of his own or by another left-wing group.\n \n**[1985 Copenhagen bombings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_Copenhagen_bombings)** \n \n &gt;On 22 July 1985, two bombs exploded in a terrorist attack in Copenhagen, Denmark. One of the bombs exploded near the Great Synagogue and a Jewish nursing home and kindergarten, and another at the offices of Northwest Orient Airlines. At least one more bomb, planned for the El Al airline offices, was discovered. One person was killed and 26 people were injured in the attacks.\n \n**[2015 Copenhagen shootings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Copenhagen_shootings)** \n \n &gt;On 14\u201315 February 2015, three separate shootings occurred in Copenhagen, Denmark. In total, two victims and the perpetrator were killed, while five police officers were wounded. The first shooting took place on 14 February at a small public afternoon event called \"Art, Blasphemy and Freedom of Expression\" at the Krudtt\u00f8nden cultural centre, where an armed gunman killed one civilian who tried to stop him and wounded three police officers.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

                    "comment": "I'll give you a very very brief summary in as impartial a way as I can. \n\n - After the Protestant Reformation, Ireland remained Catholic while England became Protestant. Around five hundred years ago, England invaded and conquered Ireland. The most infamous leader to do so was Oliver Cromwell. He committed quite a few crimes. English and Scottish Protestants began settling in Ireland during the 16th and 17th centuries, and setting up Protestant communities, which were especially strong in the area which is now Northern Ireland.\n\n - Irish Catholics were disenfranchised and oppressed for quite a long time. The Irish language was gradually pushed out and British culture was established throughout much of the island. Dublin became the UK's second city, and was the hub of British influence in Ireland. \n\n - In 1707, Scotland and England (and Wales) combined to form Great Britain. In 1801, Ireland was added to form the United Kingdom.\n\n - In the 1800s, Ireland was divided among British barons and Irish people were forced to rely on the most nutrient-rich crops, potatoes. When a potato blight hit, the island fell into a catastrophic famine. The rest of the British Isles was also in famine, but nowhere nearly as bad. At best, the British neglected to help the Irish because they thought free market economics would best fix the problem. At worst, some of them thought that it was a punishment aimed at the Irish by God for being Catholic. A million Irish died and two million left for Britain and North America. \n\n - Around the same time, a group called the Fenians appeared, which was an insurgent group intent on splitting Ireland from the UK. This developed into the IRA - the Irish Republican Army. This gradually escalated until 1919, when the Irish War of Independence broke out. The end result was that Ireland was given self rule under British control. \n\n - Most of Ireland was in favour of becoming independent. Some areas in the North were in favour of remaining in the UK. In 1921, 26 of the 32 counties left to become the Irish Free State, and later 'Ireland' (known as the Republic of Ireland to differentiate from the island itself). The remaining six counties formed Northern Ireland, which was part of the UK and had its regional capital in Belfast. \n\n - Separatist groups continued to operate in Northern Ireland, and this came to a head in the late 60s into a decades long civil war known as the Troubles. The IRA made attacks on civilians, military personnel, government institutions, figures and buildings. Numerous other paramilitaries formed. \n Some were in favour of joining the Republic - such as the PIRA, the OIRA, the CIRA, the RIRA, the NIRA, Saor Eire, Cumann na mBan. Others were loyalist, such as the Ulster Volunteer Force, the Ulster Defence Association, the Red Hand Defenders, Orange volunteers, and so on. The British military entered Northern Ireland in large numbers with the goal of maintaining order, but on several occasions they were responsible for violence too. \n\n - Republican organisations have historically associated with Palestinians, Soviets, Communists, and the descendants of Irish people living in America. Loyalist organisations have historically associated with Capitalism, Israel, and the Monarchy.\n\n - The troubles continued to escalate, with large terrorist campaigns which frequently spilled out into the UK and Europe. The worst bombing, the Omagh bombing, killed 29 people. Several bombs detonated in cities like Manchester and London, dealing a large amount of damage. One managed to kill Lord Mountbatten, a senior Royal, and another almost killed Margaret Thatcher. During the Troubles, 1,049 British servicemembers were killed, as well as 368 republican fighters and 162 loyalist fighters. 1840 civilians were killed too. The total death toll was 3532, with tens of thousands injured.\n\n - Many people throughout the UK and Ireland still hold on to deep grudges, and these are strongest of all in Northern Ireland. Northern Irish people use a variety of images, colours, sayings, place-names, and historical events to identify themselves, which is why Northern Ireland has no flag of its own and why there's a town on Google Maps called 'Derry/Londonderry'. People still get very passionate about these things.\n\n - In 1998, the Good Friday Agreement was signed, and the Troubles came to an end. There was still violence here and there, but it was largely over. Nowadays, Northern Ireland is safe to visit. According to the agreement, NI would stay part of the UK, but would have its own devolved parliament called Stormont. There would be open borders between NI and Ireland, and all Northern Irish would have a claim to Irish and British citizenship. Also Northern Ireland had the power to hold a referendum to secede from the UK whenever it chose. \n\n - Northern Ireland developed its own political parties, which were totally separate from the rest of the UK. The main two are Sinn Fein (Republican) and the DUP (Loyalist). They hate each other and often refuse to cooperate, forcing the UK government to intervene. \n\n - In 2016, the UK held a Brexit referendum. Northern Ireland votes majority to stay the EU, but some mainly unionist areas voted to leave. As a result of leaving the EU, the UK was forced to do something about its border with Ireland. Ireland and the UK struggled to come to a compromise. This became a big sticking point which made a lot of people angry, and delayed Brexit for several years, because there wasn't a good option. In the end, they agreed to keep the Irish border open, but put a customs border in the sea between the UK and Northern Ireland - a decision which angered unionists. But the UK's government has since reneged on that decision, which is currently causing tension with the EU. \n\n - Many Irish people still hate the UK (as can be seen by just looking at /r/Ireland), and many British people still hate Ireland (especially in the military). A small majority of NI continues to be in favour of the UK. A minority still wants to leave and join the Republic. As a result of the Troubles stifling investment and trade, Northern Ireland became the poorest area in the British Isles, and is economically propped up by the UK. At the same time, Ireland adopted policies which won over American corporations, and dramatically raised their GDP per Capita.\n\n - At some point in the future, NI may vote to leave the UK, and no one really knows for sure what the fallout would be if that happened. But there is a strong chance that it would reawaken many of the issues that were settled by the Good Friday agreement.",

It had been under the same monarch since the Normans conquered the British Isles.  The pope granted the title Lordship of Ireland to the monarch.  Then when Henry VIII broke with Rome he became King of Ireland.\n\nAlso I don't think it's correct to say many people in Britain hate Ireland",

It was 56/44 remain in Northern Ireland.\n\nEdit: Major correction to this: \n&gt;Votes were held, and found that large portions of the north were in favour of remaining in the UK. In 1937 Ireland was split. 26 of the 32 counties left to become the independent Republic of Ireland. The remaining six counties formed Northern Ireland, which was part of the UK and had its regional capital in Belfast.\n\nMost of this is wrong. There was no vote held on whether or not to remain part of the UK, and the Irish Free State and partition happened in 1921, not 1937.\nAnd partition was done on the basis of a boundary commission who didn't care what the locals thought. Hence Derry becoming part of Northern Ireland despite being overwhelmingly Nationalist.",

            "comment": "Weird case with Poland. According to Global Terrorism Database there were four attacks that resulted in death on at least one person (in all of them one person was killed). In 1996 Shell gas station in Warsaw was bombed. One person was killed and mysterious GN-95 group assumed responsibility. However many suspected that the mafia was behind it. In 1997 there was an explosion at the veterans gathering in Rudna. One person died and four were wounded but I would not classify it as a terrorist attack because the Police established that the victim who was also a perpetrator wanted to commit spectacular suicide. He left a suicide note in which he apologized to his family and there were no indications that he wanted to hurt anyone other than himself. The site also claims that there was a terrorist attack in 1997 in Warsaw but I wasn't able to find anything about that. And lastly there was a well-known case of 2010 attack on Law and Justice party office in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. Anti-government extremist Ryszard Cyba armed with a handgun, a knife and a stun gun killed party member Marek Rosiak and wounded another man.",

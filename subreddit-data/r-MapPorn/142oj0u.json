All we know for sure is that he was born in the Waxhaws, which is a sub-region that straddles the NC/SC border. This map is a little misleading because it purports that one President was born in Mecklenburg County (NC) and one was born in Lancaster County (SC). In fact, it's really just one and we don't know which of the two counties he was born in.\n\n*But* James Polk was born in Mecklenburg, so that makes it more complicated in terms of assigning colors. I guess the map maker is just going with Polk in Mecklenburg and Jackson in Lancaster.",

Martin Van Buren, born in New York in 1782, is considered the first president to have been born as a citizen of the United States.   It was a bit before the U.S. Constitution was written and ratified, but the United States *did* exist at that point, post-Declaration of Independence, and under the Articles of Confederation.\n\nSide bit of trivia: Martin Van Buren's birthday, 12/5/1782, is also the same day that George III formally recognized the new country's independence, a little over a year after Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown.",

The consensus of early 21st-century constitutional and legal scholars, together with relevant case law, is that natural-born citizens include, subject to exceptions, those born in the United States. As to those born elsewhere who meet the legal requirements for\u00a0birthright citizenship, the consensus emerging as of 2016 was that they also are natural-born citizens.[2][3][4]",

It doesn't specify how a person was born into this world as a citizen.\n\nAnother way to think of it is someone who is a citizen was either born one or went through the naturalization process to gain citizenship. If someone did not have to go through that process then they are a natural born citizen.\n\nAnd Amendment 14 section 1 pretty clearly says there are only two types of citizens the natural born and the naturalized. No middle type mentioned.\n\n&gt;All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.",

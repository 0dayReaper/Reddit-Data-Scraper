            "comment": "The central excise duty accounts for 20% of the petrol price and 17.6% of the diesel price in India. Specifically, for petrol, the components of the excise duty include a Basic excise duty of \u20b91.80, a Road and Infrastructural Development Cess of \u20b98, an Agricultural and Infrastructural Development Cess of \u20b92.50, and an Additional excise duty of \u20b97.60, resulting in a Total Central Excise Duty of \u20b919.90.\r  \n\r  \nThe government collects a significant amount of revenue from central excise duties on petrol and diesel. For example, the amounts collected (including cesses) in different years were \u20b92,10,282 crores in 2018-19, \u20b92,19,750 crores in 2019-20, and \u20b93,71,908 crores in 2020-21. The government officially states that these excise duties are levied to generate substantial revenue, which is then allocated for development purposes.\r  \n\r  \nAlthough excise duty remains consistent throughout India, state taxes such as sales tax and value-added tax differ based on the rates set by individual state governments. These taxes contribute to the increased cost of fuel for consumers. The significant rise in fuel prices nationwide has been a subject of extensive discussion and debate for quite some time.",

                            "comment": "The best way to do that is for the Central Government to underwrite the loans (not 100%, but up to a certain value) for commercial EVs like autos, taxis and cargo vans. Right now financing is the major issue and banks are hesitant to give out large loans to working class people for these vehicles.\n\nOnce financing is solved, we all know that the savings in fuel cost would enable most of them to pay back the loans on time.",

I live in Madhya Pradesh (third highest excise rate of all the states) and my city has the best public transport in the state but is not good when compared to cities in lot of the other states. Duties are by states and not cities. Every state governments agenda for this is different and mostly focused towards political gain, which are not very understandable at times",

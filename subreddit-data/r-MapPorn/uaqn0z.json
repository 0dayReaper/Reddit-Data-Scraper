However, I'd actually recommend a different extension, which is made by a former developer of Privacy Badger, [Privacy Possum](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-possum/), which \"monkey wrenches common commercial tracking methods by reducing and falsifying the data gathered by tracking companies.\"",

There are a series of web standards that define what things a web browser should do (e.g. when a page contains an element `&lt;img&gt;`, render it as an image). Ideally, these standards should be settled a priori and then implemented by vendors (i.e. browsers), but more often than not it's the other way around: browser implement experimental features that they themselves come up with, and eventually website programmers expect those features to be there and then a standard is created to support such feature.\n\nIf Chromium holds the majority of the share, it is very easy for them to get away creating new features without anybody being able to stop them in a practical manner. This is fine for most features (although, still, they shouldn't bear this power alone), but there are more controversial ones like things relating to DRM and privacy in which it is dangerous that one single entity can decide what is valid in a website and what isn't.",

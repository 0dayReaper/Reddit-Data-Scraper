Linguists generally respect native speakers' assessments about this sort of thing, so they are either referred to as dialects or varieties in linguistic literature.",

Convention translates this term in English to be \u201cdialect(s)\u201d, but what it is really referring to (usually) is much more macroscopic and conglomerate. \n\n\u201cChinese dialects\u201d is basic equivalent to \u201cIndo-European dialects\u201d. \n\nSimilarly, the ethnolinguistic classification \u201cHan Chinese\u201d is basically equivalent to \u201cEuropean\u201d in terms of broadness &amp; internal diversity",

From your experience with Chinese, is the Chinese linguistic category term for, say, English or French the same as that for the body of Chinese fangyan?",

There is, in fact, plenty of criticism towards venezuelan policies from left oriented perspectives.\n\nIt's, however, quite the difficult, if not impossible, task to judge the performance of Venezuelan economy without taking into considerarion the huge pressure applies by the sanctions. Ignoring them will make for a less than honest and very imperfect evaluation. It's the same for Cuba, North Korea and any other nationalist left oriented regime who sought to avoid US/EU exploitation (not meaning that this alone makes them heroes or anything) and got economically/militarily attacked by these hegemonic powers. Without this context, no judgement is for real, it's just a floating and usually morally/ideologically charged speech.",

And, again, I'm not saying it wouldn't be bad, I'm saying without removing the actual sanction variable properly, there is no science-oriented way of doing that, as the sanctions have an impact on everything, enough to make it, afaik, impossible to calculate. Everything gets more expensive due to the sactions, for example.\n\nHope I made clear this is not about defending Maduro, bolivarianism or whatever.",

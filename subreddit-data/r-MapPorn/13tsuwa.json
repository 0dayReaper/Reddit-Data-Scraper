Rather the issue was that constitutionally the Twenty-first Amendment (the one that repealed prohibition), Section 2 implies that the states are ultimately in charge of regulating the sale, manufacture, and transportation of alcohol. So to get around this, they said \"yes states have the right to regulate alcohol\",  but if you don't meet the requirements of a general age limit of 21, you will see a reduction of 10% of your highway funding. The courts ruled that there was sufficient nexus between highway funding and age limits on alcohol, mainly due to intense lobbying from insurance companies which provided copious amounts of data showing that younger drivers who drank were more dangerous (duh) so the drinking limit was really a road safety law, with a reduction in road funding for not adopting it. (This being their logic, not mine).",

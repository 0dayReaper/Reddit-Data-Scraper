It's led by the radical-right Brothers of Italy, a party with a neo-fascist lineage. \n\n The second largest party in the coalition is Lega, who are right wing populists.\n\nThe other two parties in the grouping can reasonably be described as ideologically centre-right, but they represent less than 20% of the seats held by the coalition. And frankly, if you're supporting a neo-fascist Prime Minister, you don't get to call yourself a centrist.",

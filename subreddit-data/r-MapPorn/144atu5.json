It's mostly specific zones that are always having issues. \n\nThe thing with Tijuana is that it just grew up exponentially in a relatively short period of time, without any planning, no infrastructure, and people keep coming and coming nonstop despite being overpopulated already, not just from other places of Mexico, but now from other countries as well.\n\nBut to your original question, the state or two states, are rather new compared to the rest of Mexico. For the longest time they were considered just a \"territory\". It wasn't until the 1950's that it became officially a state. Tijuana itself, as a city, is maybe twice as old as that, but still for a long time was dependent of the other municipalities, Ensenada and Mexicali. So I suppose it wasn't until they became equal to other states that people started to migrate here. \n\nI think that had Europeans started an urbanization of this area along with the oldest cities of Mexico, by now we would have a bigger populated area despite the rough environments. But in a way I'm glad we have bigger natural areas instead.",

So based on this map I would assume Mexico City has far less people living close to each other and that they're spaced out over a much larger area than Monterrey.\n\nAnd inversely it would be assumed on this map there's way more people in Monterrey living in smaller areas BUT over a much larger area than Mexico City? But the data I'm finding online says the opposite that Mexico City has twice as high of a population density as Monterrey, so that doesn't make sense.",

Relativity at the time was still relatively new and most of its claims were unproven. Einstein died in 1955 and Nobel prizes can\u2019t be awarded posthumously.\n\n&gt; It skews very Germanic and Anglo Saxon, as you can see by the ratio of Top scientific papers to nobel prices, south Korea has significantly fewer than they deserve, while the UK more\n\nThis is a pretty bad analysis of the facts. The UK had a much older scientific practice than South Korea in centuries old universities such as Oxford and Cambridge. South Korea was a war torn country only about 70 years ago and it had never industrialized. It was poorer than North Korea up until 1968 and was poorer than Mexico up until 1987. South Korea had an economy miracle starting in the 80s that allowed it to develop rapidly. The problem is Nobel prizes take a lot of time to be awarded. Scientist usually wait 20-24 years after publishing to win their prize. \n\nhttps://www.nature.com/nature-index/news-blog/chemistry-fastest-path-nobel-prize \n\n&gt; It is not an objective institution, it's actually pretty far from it\n\nIt\u2019s pretty good all things considered.",

Argentina wasn't the only country where Nazis ended, but it wasn't even the top destination (USA and Russia come to mind) They flee here to hide, meanwhile they were taken to the USA and Russia for their war machine",

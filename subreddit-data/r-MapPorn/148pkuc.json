Portugal, Luxembourg, Monaco, Montenegro, San Marino and Liechtenstein are genderless.\n\nOne says:\n\n\"Vou para a Fran\u00e7a\" = I'm going to France, feminine article.\n\n\"Vou para o Vaticano\" = I'm going to Vatican, masculine article.\n\n\"Vou para Portugal\" = I'm going to Portugal, no article.",

Blue for masculine, pink for feminine, gray for genderless.\n\nIt's interesting that the normal rule in Portuguese that words ending in \"a\" are feminine doesn't necessarily apply to countries. Panama and Canada are masculine, while Cuba is genderless.",

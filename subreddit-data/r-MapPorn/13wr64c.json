Italy switch sides after Austria-Hungary agreed to cede South Tyrol\n3. Portugal joined to support their ally Britian against Spain, since this is based on the book I made with the help of God, Spain joined after Germany sunk one of it's passenger ships.",

Also strange how Britain gained land in Brittany and Iberia even though they would have lost.",

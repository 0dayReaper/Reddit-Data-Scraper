Would have saved three years of war which featured massive death and destruction\n\nBut then, if McClellan had won the decisive victory. I don't think Lincoln would have issued the Emancipation Proclamation, so maybe the death and destruction for the rest of the war was worth it? Some awful choices there...",

The enemy can stay in their trenches and behind their barriers, while you have to go out into the open to take more land. That's why the Civil War took so long, even though the CSA was smaller and had worse technology. Generally, it was the Union on the offensive, trying to occupy territory in the south. It wasn't until Lincoln started authorizing the targeting of southern infrastructure that the north started making major strides towards winning the war.",

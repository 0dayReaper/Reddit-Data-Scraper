But\u2014 they have law enforcement nearby. They have criminals nearby. Someone in the middle of nowhere doesn\u2019t really see the impact of firearms being used for violent crimes all the time... and the police are not nearby. \n\nIt\u2019s not that either of their lived experiences or opinions are wrong, just that they are different. \n\nIt truly is not \u201cfair\u201d for one group to establish a forceful way of living for everyone involved- considering the dramatically different variables affecting the lives of all parties.",

People who claim a lack of intelligence or education in their political opposites are actually ignorant and should probably travel the country to visit some of these people they claim are extremely racist and uneducated.  \n\nSure its easy to pick a caricature of villainy on the other side but a majority of Americans no matter where they come from just want a decent living and uphold their values.  Im a minority and an immigrant.   I remember visiting Mississippi for military training thinking that place was ass backwards initially.  I had a family host me for thanksgiving there and they were the kindest most hospitable people I have met.  That wasn't an isolated incident either.  I generally found that to hold the same across parts of the country I was able to visit.  \n\nPeople should understand their neighbors before passing judgement on them.  Bigotry and bias exists on both sides of the political spectrum.",

The electoral college only applies to the presidential election, and the duties of the president are far more broad than focusing on the specific needs of rural areas. Should rural areas have a larger say in choosing who will lead the US in terms of global politics? I don't think so. Rural areas still get representation at the local, state, and federal levels, and rural areas should still be valued as a part of this country, but I for one don't agree that they should have a disproportionate voice in choosing the president and vice president.",

            "comment": "Sort of.\n\nI live in Tarrant County, Texas, which other than voting for Beto O'Rourke in 2018's Senate race, is the most populous Republican stronghold in the US. Our largest city is Fort Worth and by now there are an estimated 2 million people living here.\n\nOriginally I am from New Hampshire; our two most urbanized counties have gone red the past few elections, but most of the rural counties are blue. Many rural counties in New England go blue nearly every Presidential election. A lot of those blue counties in California are rural, as well. Hawaii has pretty much only one fully urbanized county - Honolulu - yet the entire state is very reliably blue for Presidential elections.\n\nIn Texas, the urban/rural divide is many times true until you reach the southern border region, which tends to lean blue.\n\nYou also did not show many Southern states where rural counties are heavily blue.\n\nMany times, it is not a urban/rural divide, but a white/nonwhite divide. In the Deep South, those blue rural counties are majority black. In Texas, the border region is majority Hispanic (Mexican, specifically). Dallas, Harris, and Travis counties are urban but also majority-minority. In California, many of those rural blue counties are heavily Hispanic. In the same vein, Staten Island in NY is usually red and just so happens to be majority white. All of the cities labeled in this map have large populations of ethnic minorities.\n\nOf course, Tarrant County is quite diverse, and rural New England is almost entirely white (when not part of an Indian reservation). But New England's political culture is a different beast compared to the rest of the US and Tarrant County is not so much red anymore, but purple. Biden lost by less than 1% here.\n\nWhen the Democratic Party and the Republican Party evolved to their current form, back in the mid- to late-20th century, Southern whites went from voting almost entirely Democratic to almost entirely Republican, and Black Southerners did the opposite. You can examine the histories of constituencies and identify when an incumbent senator, representative, etc. switched their political affiliation; it's usually during the Reagan administration. The same political legacy of the Old South remains, yet under different labels. It was only during that transition period, e.g. when Clinton was elected, that former Democratic whites could be swung back to the blue. West Virginia was reliably Democratic... until it wasn't.\n\nWhile an urban/rural divide is an important aspect of US American politics, it cannot explain everything. US cities are typically much more diverse than the surrounding areas, but the exceptions to this are highly visible. On top of this are the unique political cultures of each state, income levels, and economic activity.\n\n*Travis county is majority non-Hispanic white; thank you for the correction, r/striker169",

Fiscally it's very conservative to the degree of having a borderline libertarian streak, but socially it's pretty far left. On foreign policy, I wouldn't say there's a clear cut lean one way or the other. Strangely NH is the one New England state that hasn't legalized pot, and on top of all that, NH has one of the highest standards of living in the country. It's really not all one thing or the other.",

It's still very much a working class borough compared to the other boroughs. Lots of police, firemen, sanitation, and union tradespeople live there. All of which tend to align themselves with the republican party these days.\n\nCompared to the rest of the boroughs, there are a lot fewer 1st generation immigrants, who overwhelming tend to vote democrat. A huge portion of Staten Island's population is Italian-American, most of which are 3rd or 4th generation by now. Staten Island does have a good amount of relatively recent russian immigrants but they then to be well off economically, and tend to align themselves with the republican party as well.\n\nThere are also way fewer transplants from other parts of the country, compared to the other boroughs. Many NYC transplants move to NYC specifically for the liberal society and mindset. For example, think about members of the lgbt community that grow up in small town america and move to NYC to escape their oppressive home town. These transplants are not moving to Staten Island \n\nThe last big point is the minority population in Staten Island, or the lack thereof compared to the rest of the boroughs. Staten Island is still overwhelmingly white. And the type of white, as I mentioned earlier, that tends to align themselves with the republican party.",

Well. The programs mentioned above are now taken for granted (that\u2019s what happens with time), and that sentiment of self reliance,  which led to places like Saskatchewan to invent such programs for the rest of Canada (because nobody else was helping the rural folk) also is a sentiment which conservative parties play into. \n\n Self reliance from government intervention is a powerful sentiment.\n\nJust as rural areas flipped from left to right in Canada over decades, don\u2019t think it can\u2019t happen elsewhere.",

The traditional left (that has never been so left-ish as today) is slowly being destroyed between the hammer (socially conservative populism) and the anvil (cities voting for right economic policy). The conservatives are a curious case, for they are deeply divided both on social issues as well as on economic issues. The only way they are able to survive is by presenting themselves as the only 'real' patriots and the only stable party, basically.",

It's like that episode of It's Always Sunny, where they think Brazilians are like \"Los Angeles Cholos\". Brazilians aren't hispanic and have a much more nuanced culture than just bossa nova and beaches. \n\nPeople also don't know very basic things about geography, like how most of Mexico's population isn't right below California and Texas, but in central southern Mexico, not bordering on the United States. Like 90%. Very few Mexicans live near the border, other than Tijuana (and kinda) Monterrey. And besides having the same language, Mexico and other places like Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, etc all are quite different with different dialects and cultures. Not even including Caribbean islands. \n\nSo In this aspect I feel like calling people Latino is like calling everybody from the east Asians and expecting them to all look Chinese.",

France before 2017 still had a pretty strong divide between historic rural labor strongholds and anti-labor rural areas.\n\nSome countries have stronger regional divides where both cities and rural areas in one section of the country will favor a particular party while another geographic area of the country will vote for another party. It doesn't even have to be with explicitly regional parties. In Italy, the 5 Star Movement just does really well in Southern Italian cities/countryside but not the North. Poland has a general urban-rural divide but has a stronger divide between what is called [Poland A and Poland B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland_A_and_B). Also, the more traditionalistic and rural PiS party in Poland tends to be more supportive of expanding the social safety net than the more socially liberal party",

Urban counties contain about a third, and suburban counties over half. If suburban counties voted like urban ones, Republicans could win rural counties at 100% and would still lose most elections. The typical Republican is a suburban homeowner.\n\nAdditionally, the red/blue color coding is always a bit misleading. In the 2018 midterms 46% of people in rural counties voted Democrat. That was 52% in suburban counties and 61% in urban counties. So if you're in a rural diner with 20 people in it, you'll typically have 9 Dem voters; if you were in a city, there'd be 12. It's not as if it's 1 and 19. The rural-urban divide is a general trend, but neighbors are divided in their politics everywhere, just at slightly different rates.",

It is defined by a characteristic lacking of economic activities as they are residential extension of urban cores, a.k.a. sleeper towns, not by what they look like.\n\nThe Anglosphere's style of detached home suburbia is unique among the world. It is much, much more rural than urban; American style of homeowning is a direct descendent of, and deliberately mimicking, homesteading; and with it, the values associated with this lifestyle like traditional big families, functional independence (DIY much?), and even agrarianism (weekly lawn mowing) All of them promote and reproduce conservative and traditionalist values. There is a reason here in China we call the American landscape \"the great farmland\", because American suburbs are homesteads in the eyes of people unfamiliar with this culture. \n\nIn comparison, suburbs can totally look like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdistrict), or even [this](https://www.insauga.com/major-development-with-boutique-hotel-proposed-for-one-of-mississaugas-busiest-neighbourhoods) for a North American example. (Mississauga is specifically chosen because few City Centre residents work there, it's either Toronto or industrial areas of Peel that's a 30 minute drive away. I used to live there. It's slowly transitioning into a self-sustaining core but it's a suburb for the time being) While also sleeper towns, they are more urban than rural: they foster totally different activities like commuting via public transportation, small businesses, and new technologies like online shopping, and so they promote a more diverse range of values.\n\nIf we can see this level of connection, then yes, the American political divide can be interpreted as urban-rural divide, and it's an interesting way to approach this problem.",

They cause massive traffic and use massive amounts of energy, on top of homogenizing vast areas. Furthermore, they are causing cities to essentially be nothing more than commuting destinations. Look at a map of an American downtown, you'll see skyrises and parking lots. Lots of parking lots. And they keep getting built.\n\nSuburbs don't have to be like this. In Germany, 78% of people live in Urban areas, but the portion that lives in suburbs is rather small. Here's a few examples.\n\n[Neutraubling, suburb of Regensburg](https://www.google.de/maps/place/93073+Neutraubling/@48.9799815,12.1871639,5869m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x479fc31147ac63d3:0x377d97f27a09f68b!8m2!3d48.9854354!4d12.1959296)\n\n[Puchheim, suburb of Munich](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Puchheim-Bahnhof,+82178+Puchheim/@48.1722972,11.3346828,5964m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x479e7f4b55addb19:0xa1e48b04c02afe0!8m2!3d48.1743749!4d11.3565176)\n\n[Fellbach, suburb of Stuttgart](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Fellbach/@48.8205292,9.24341,11776m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4799c5ebcf911453:0xc0d8309bb209acd4!8m2!3d48.8215653!4d9.2702944)\n\nCompare that to American suburbs. Vast areas of nothing but housing, without any amenities. No Transit, shops are only big box stores near highways, schools have big parking lots etc. The average American urban lifestyle isn't urban.",

Service roads and postal routes were usually along section boundaries.\n\nIt all helped with land management when it was all empty.  It helped them divvy it out during the homestead era.  If it stayed rural, it is pretty boring.  If it got settled it is interesting to see the remnants of this system.  The main thru streets in the suburbs near me tend to be old section boundary roads with the winding residential streets being platted in between.",

The other group that includes both rural and urban residents are small business owners for the majority of the same reasons. Then the sprinkling of folks that that agree with these folks.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of the negative talk about red VS blue is simply not true.  Both sides have extreme leaning groups that are shitty. Unfortunately, the media and our politicians use those folks as examples n both sides to scare the other side.  Nazis VS Communists, etc..  Most folks are mostly just too lazy to look beyond the narrative spoon fed to us by our media.\n\nThe underlying good news is that both sides actually want very similar outcomes.  Its HOW to get there that they disagree on. For example:\n\n\\-Kids in cages at the border. No reasonable person actually wants this. Its a horrible result of an outdated system being overwhelmed.\n\nDems - make the process easier, smoother and faster, stop unnecessary separations. Allow for easier migration while maintaining security. Trust people to complete the process (because if you make it easier more people will comply willingly).\n\nRepubs - have process points , rather than an unregulated border. Wall=no need to process so many at a time to make the process smoother and faster, stop unnecessary separations, while maintaining security.  Controlled processing and screening will help to stop human trafficking through migration points (the reason for separation during the validation steps) and reduce the flow of drugs.",

The former-urbans want the same services they had in an urban area and the rurals are like \"Who's going to pay for that?\"\n\nThe rurals live where they live by choice.

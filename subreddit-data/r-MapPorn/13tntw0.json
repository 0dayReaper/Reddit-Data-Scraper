It\u2019s Mexico in the US, but the surprising bit is how large the margin is. That site says the runners-up are Canada-USA (15), Japan-USA (14, plus one in Guam), Chile-Argentina (14), and Turkey-Germany (14).",

The embassy is the main mission, almost always in the capital, and then consulates are smaller ones in other cities. \n\nThere's also permanent missions, which are countries' diplomatic missions to the UN. And commonwealth countries call their embassies in other commonwealth countries \"high commission\".",

Embassies provide more than just consular services, they also may be involved in diplomatic, trade, military and other discussions.  The Ambassador is usually the highest ranking representative from that country and is based out of the embassy.\n\nConsulates are usually smaller, located in cities other than the capital, and are more involved in consular services such as visas, permits, assistance to citizens of that country, culture, trade and tourist propagation/information etc. Consulates may not provide all the services, and requestor may be directed to a Consulate General or the Embassy.\n\nConsulate Generals are usually larger than consulates and are in the more important non capital cities, especially those cities where there are many citizens of the country or that city is important for other reasons such as trade.\n\nAgain, there are many exceptions, in some cases you have charg\u00e9 d'affaires, where the diplomatic relationships are lower level than an ambassador.",

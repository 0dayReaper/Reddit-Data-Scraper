I mean it\u2018s probably doable in some way if you live quite a bit outside but you\u2018d have to live a very very humble lifestyle.",

Yes its expensive but 3.4k Eur isnt a small amount of money. \n\nSo i just googled for rooms in Z\u00fcrich, took the first link that google gave me and i found a couple of rooms below 1k, many below 1.5k. \n\nIf you dont need an entire apartement for yourself and you dont eat out a lot im very sure that you can live a reasonable student livestyle on that budget.",

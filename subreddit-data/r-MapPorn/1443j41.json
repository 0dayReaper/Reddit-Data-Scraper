Trenches MIGHT stop attacks. A suddenly much wider, faster flowing, debris filled, muddy, too deep to walk through, too shallow to get a heavy landing craft through, unexpected river will almost CERTAINLY stop attacks, at least for the time being. This definitely does not make an attack in that area easier for Ukraine. Even if they could somehow get the water back down to normal levels tomorrow, the damage to local infrastructure, bad ground conditions, and displaced positions will hamper any Ukrainian attack for months.",

Dams take a lot of explosives to breach, being made of reinforced concrete.\n\nThe only people who could have breached the dam without a large bombardment (something that's readily observable and which we see no evidence of) are the Russians. Now it's still possible that they fucked up and did it accidentally, but if they were worried about a Ukrainian attack across the Dnieper then the start of the counterattack is the natural time to do this to preclude that and and free up Russians forces for redeployment north and east.",

Break of the dam damaged Russian side a lot more + Crimea water supply + a lot more work with dealing with evacuation, and washing away mine fields. Only advantage I can think of for Russian side, is that Dniper is now harder to cross, but it was already a huge river",

Conversely the flooding prevents a crossing in the short term which coincides with Ukraine\u2019s Southern offensive. The facts of the matter are that we don\u2019t know who did it and we probably won\u2019t know until this war is over.",

It is their best hope of holding the territory they have invaded. \n\nDid Russia care about the infrastructure in Mariupol or Bakhmut, which it also claims as its territory? Absolutely not - it completely destroyed everything. Infrastructure and civilian lives do not matter to Russia in this war. If they win, areas can be repopulated with Russians, and infrastructure can be replaced. \n\nDestroying the dam also floods the ground on the left side of the river and makes it far more difficult to cross, thus reducing the chance of an offensive in that region meaning they can redirect some of the troops occupying that area to other sectors of the front.",

Plus tremendous ecological damage as well as damage to their own people, while possible for them to consider as they are at war, on this scale is just absurd as it ruins so much of their country.\n\nAlso it's not like Ukraine could blow it up without it being very clear it was them, and Russians would be screaming from the top of mountains about sustained bombardments and showing videos of it as these dams are no joke. And we see none of that, which means it could only have either been a maintenance fuck up or deliberate sabotage.\n\nUkraine is also on the attack, not defense, so blowing up the dam while washing away Russian positions, still doesn't let them capitalize on it for a long while in which the Russians have time to fortify.",

And its also the reason why nobody is going to declare war with Russia because that'd mean that Russia can attack their own territory as well. \n\nEveryone is helping Ukraine while keeping their distance from Russia because they dont want to start shit with Russia directly. As i said if push comes to shove west will leave Ukraine to dry because they cant risk starting a war with Russia because nobody wins if that happens, its gonna be a pyrrhic victory for whoever wins its just not worth \"saving\" Ukraine if it means we all get fucked.",

This war could escalate very quickly, any day. \n\nI agree that it\u2019s wrong to make direct parallels between Ukraine and world wars (not that it stops anyone comparing anyone else supporting negotiation to Chamberlain and Putin with Hitler), but to illustrate this, the allied and central powers in WW1 were very very close a ceasefire and peace agreement early in the war. They had to abandon it because populations in both sides were so riled up, full of war hysteria, and wanted victory at all costs. How many lives were lost because of this?",

Remember when Turkey accidentally shot down a Russian jet in Syria and the trouble that caused and the huge diplomatic effort made to prevent further conflict?

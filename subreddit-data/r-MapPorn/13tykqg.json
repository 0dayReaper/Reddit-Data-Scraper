I don't understand it. \n\n\"Homeless\" is a matter of fact that doesn't go into how and why, while \"unhoused\" implies someone is responsible for \"housing\" them, but hasn't done so. Nevertheless, we're told to say \"unhoused\".",

However, I think it's important to think about why and from where the change comes. It's not (at least, not always) woke for the sake of being woke. The way we speak about things including the terminology we use _does_ matter and, if we're talking about groups of people for example, I think it's important to listen to them and what words or language they prefer. And that's not because anyone is forcing you to do so (they're not), but out of a bit of common decency. Different language can make some people feel more comfortable and welcome in society, can make important issues more transparent and understood, and can challenge those issues. Think about how important language around gender has been in beginning to destigmatise being transgender, for example. In cases like that, inventing language or reusing existing language (words like \"queer\", or the use of pronouns) are part and parcel of an important and significant social change. To me, it's just part of the way we should always be challenging ourselves and society to be better.",

Next time don't go so fast into attack mode even with opposing views and just ask a question. \n\nHomeless vs. houseless. First of the charter of human rights acknowledges housing as a fundamental right, which nobody should be denied. So yeah, somebody should take care of their citizens. It is a hard problem to solve but especially in countries with less protection for renters homelessness can be real quick. But back to the topic why those words. A home is much more than shelter, it's a place where people like to be and feel protect, it's an idea so to speak. Especially for homeless people who lived a long time without it, a simple apartment or house will not be a home for a long time. But as studies and projects have shown time and time again, if you give them a house (apartment in most cases) first without any strings attached, they begin to get their life back on track. Not all, and most need additional help but giving them a place and taking care of rest later is the surest way to help them. So yeah the home is an ideal and a house something concrete that's why there is a shift.",

I've decided to edit all my previous comments as an act of protest against the recent changes in Reddit's API pricing model.    These changes are severe enough to threaten the existence of popular 3rd party apps like Apollo and Boost, which have been vital to the Reddit experience for countless users like you and me. The new API pricing is prohibitively expensive for these apps, potentially driving them out of business and thereby significantly reducing our options for how we interact with Reddit.  This isn't just about keeping our favorite apps alive, it's about maintaining the ethos of the internet: a place where freedom, diversity, and accessibility are championed. By pricing these third-party developers out of the market, Reddit is creating a less diverse, less accessible platform that caters more to their bottom line than to the best interests of the community.  If you're reading this, I urge you to make your voice heard. Stand with us in solidarity against these changes. The userbase is Reddit's most important asset, and together we have the power to influence this decision. r/Save3rdPartyApps -- mass edited with https://redact.dev/",

This is much simpler than signing a contract with an underage person that will still require their parents or guardian to cosign.\n\nAs for work - you do not need to have a bank account to work, cash payments are allowed (and popular) for smaller amounts and kids are very limited in how much they can work. They can also provide a parent's bank account (which in fact may be their own account on the name of the parent). Also, school students (that is, people under 19 ) very rarely work. \n\nAnd lastly, if kids work, they most likely work illegally, just like many adults. The grey economy is quite significant - sometimes it can be that the official salary is smaller, to avoid taxes, but in some very basic jobs it's all cache and no contracts (like repairmen, builders, etc)",

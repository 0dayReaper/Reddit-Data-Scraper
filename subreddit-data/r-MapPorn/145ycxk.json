There were 15 countries in the Union, and Russia wasn't even the last one to leave (it was dissolved by Kazakhstan)\n\nBecause it's the way it's done in international relations. Nations recognize the state as the successor state. In this case Russia the succesor to the USSR. It's the way its one to keep loans etc. being paid etc.. Here you can see [US government recognizing Russia as the successor to the USSR](https://history.state.gov/countries/soviet-union). Likewise you would find among most goverments around the world.. It's a bit of the same with west- and east-germany.. internationally governments around the world recognize east-germany disolving/incoorperating into west-germany as germany... meaning that the loans and other stuff. relating to east-germany being taken over by the united germany..\n\nThough surely a lot of the substance of USSR football was in Ukraine at the time of the USSR.. though it doesn't affect regarding what is considered a successor state.. That's more political stuff.",

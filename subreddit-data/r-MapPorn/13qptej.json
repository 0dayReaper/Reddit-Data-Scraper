The Chinese word for \"Mexico\" is \u58a8\u897f\u54e5, which is pronounced \"M\u00f2-x\u012b-g\u0113\" in Mandarin, which sounds *nothing* like \"Mexico\", no matter how you slice it. Buuut, in Cantonese, it's pronounced \"Mahk-s\u0101i-g\u014d\", which sounds an awful lot like the English pronunciation. The word was probably borrowed from English into Cantonese (or a closely related variety of Chinese), and from then on to Mandarin. And Mandarin drops final \"-k\"s, so it kind of randomly ended up with a pronunciation slightly closer to Nahuatl.\n\nChinese loanwords are sometimes funny like that because what happens is they get loaned into one variety of Chinese. The speakers of that variety approximate the pronunciation of the word within their own phonology, and then choose Chinese characters that have the closest pronunciations. But when the word gets passed into other varieties of Chinese, the speakers of the other variety look at the characters and pronounce them how they would normally pronounce them, which might be completely differently than the original word. \n\nFor an example of the other direction, Lithuania is \u7acb\u9676\u5b9b, which is pronounced \"L\u00ec-t\u00e1o-w\u01cen\", pretty close to \"Lithuan(ia)\" (it's actually based on the German \"Litauen\"). But in Cantonese, the country is pronounced \"Laahp-t\u00f2uh-y\u00fan\", which I don't think anybody would recognize as \"Lithuania\".",

But we still have some traditions from it, when comes to e.g. naming things. Latin language isn't about Roman speakers ;)\n\nFrom [Name of Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_of_Mexico):\n\n&gt;In 1821, the continental part of New Spain seceded from Spain during the Trienio Liberal, in which Agustin de Iturbide marched triumphantly with his Army of the Three Guarantees (religion, independence, and unity). This was followed by the birth of the short-lived First Mexican Empire that used the \"Mexico\" name according to the convention used previously by Roman Empire (Latin: *Imperium* ***Romanum***) and the Holy Roman Empire, whereby the capital gives rise to the name of the Empire. This was the first recorded use of \"Mexico\" as a country title.\n\nThat's why ***Mexicum***.\n\nYou are aware that there is Latin Wikipedia, right? ;) With MODERN concepts.\n\n[*Mexicum*](https://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexicum) \\- the first link about name (from 16th c.) - 'related to the city: [Mexico](https://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexicopolis)', like *Romanum* 'related to the city: Rome'.",

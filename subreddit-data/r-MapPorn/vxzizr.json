Add to that the ever changing sands and tides, and the scale you compare it at (1 meter width, 1 km, 1000 km) and you can make near infinite coastlines for comparisons. Not detracting from the original comment- I'm sure there is enough in space to make reasonable comparisons for any coastline too. Just adding a fun bit about fractal coasts.",

In fact, I think it was his book about the fractal patterns in nature that got the scientists to buy in that then got the math world to buy in. Bunch of gatekeeping euclideans.\n\nBut now, this is pretty obvious. The interesting thing is that the shape of a coastline is often formed by erosion. Maybe there is erosion of a sort in space. Or, coastline are shaped by volcanic eruptions that blast out and cool rapidly in water, and then more lava bubbles over the first it repeats again and again, and this nebula sort of looks like an explosion of gas. I don't know much about Algeria's geology or this nebula, but either process could produce similar shapes if they were similar. I think Algeria is sedimentary and erosion is the primary shape making process. So I guess the nebula could be losing gas as stars are formed and space \"wind\" ([torrents of radiation created by the celestial newborns are driving out the remaining gas.]( https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/dec/03/astronomers-mystery-universe-missing-stars)) take material away.",

Probably because the south is so sparsely populated and exerces so little influence or contribution to the North's culture, the latter being the core of the country, both historically and contemporaneously, that it's often completely ignored, geographically for instance.",

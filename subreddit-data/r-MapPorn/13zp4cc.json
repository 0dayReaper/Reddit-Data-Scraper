The rebellion started in 1960, and only ended in 1974, after the portuguese dictator Salazar was deposed. Many people forget that the rebellion, in several colonies, was supported by the USSR, PRC, Cuba, etc, with the support of the USA. Many portuguese vets still live everyday with the nighmare... fighting, killing, and being killed in the \"colonies\".",

They provided education programs as well sanitary, economic and religious aid to the local populations, which gave them better living conditions. These local populations would then support Portugal and often turn on their own countrymen.\n\nPortugal could do this because it had more money and more \"brain power\". All the revolutionary forces had was weapons and guerrilla tactics, which could do little against unfriendly populations.\n\nThe US and the USSR weren't only supporting the independence movements. They also had interests in Portugal and both the CIA and the KGB were operating there. They were pretty much financing everyone involved in the war.",

This was carried out either by air bombing by the air force or ground raids by the army.",

All the \u201coppressed\u201d are migrating like crazy to live by the rule of their former \u201coppressors\u201d and so on\n\nPortugal was the ethical player in all of this story even if this buthurts modern people\u2026 They focused on the development of their territories, they ensured equal access to voting to all citizens, they fought against foreign governments who armed and created rebellions just to get economic access to those regions. Funny enough until oil was discovered in Angola no rebels were financed\u2026 And the first one to finance was the US in 1961. In one weekend the rebel group killed 1500 civilians, mostly black people who refused to rebel and a lot of women and children\n. The pictures are sickening. Women with breasts removed, children with squashed heads. Their crime? They were white civilians, many of them living there for centuries\n\nPortugal had occupied and administered its territories for longer than Ukraine has crimea\u2026\n\nPeople taking about international conflicts is a joke\u2026",

These programs and aids were all short term and isolated events done out of pure military interest. \n\nPortugal did develop its overseas territories, but mostly for its own Portuguese people and most times at the expense of the local population, which was handled like slaves (similar to Asian minorities in the Emirates nowadays). You can still see the effects of this today if you go to Angola or Mozambique - the locals automatically call you doctor, engineer or boss if you\u2019re white. \n\nI\u2019m Portuguese and I have several African friends whose parents lived under colonial rule. They don\u2019t like the current state of things, but they didn\u2019t like it back then either.",

Virtually no one lived under that period. I\u2019ve lived in Angola and Mozambique in recent years. Nearly all the elderly spoke well of the old regime and say they were tricked.\n\nThe reality is that almost all governments don\u2019t do shit unless there is public unrest.  Portugal until de 1950s was busy trying to survive two world wars and political unrest. Colonial improvement was the least of the priority and even with that the people under Portuguese rule lived no worse than anywhere else in African and virtually no worse than today (apart from technology improvement\u2026 there was no smartphones in 1950)\n\nIndia today also didn\u2019t developed the sentinel islands\u2026 People are living in the Neolithic there\u2026 are you or anyone complaint about it? Most of Portugal overseas had virtually no enforcement of Portuguese customs until 1950. People were \u201cfree\u201d\n\nThen throughout the 50s until the 70s Portugal elevated its overseas territories more than mainland Portugal. Even a por black worker in Angola had electricity in his house while in mainland Portugal most of the people lived by candlelight\u2026\n\nSo the modern narrative is BS. It\u2019s anti European defamation. Our ancestors did amazing things. They held out against imperial America and imperial Russia at the same time. They prevented millions of deaths for nearly 15 years of war. They prepared those countries with infrastructure and institutions to become regional powers.  And it was all for nothing. Worse than nothing, it was all to be defamated by the new spoiled generations (which include everyone born in 1960s onward)\n\nJust for you to see the cognitive dissonance, Portugal had black women in the frickin parliament!!! In the 1960s!!! The supposed \u201cracist\u201d regime had more black representation than todays government. Not even the US, France or UK had that level of integration, and they were the \u201cdemocratic west\u201d\n\nPlease see the documentary \u201ca guerra\u201d of Joaquim Furtado . One of the best episodes is about the economic and social development. And the MPLA terrorists being interviewed explained how affraid they were. They said that people were living so much better it was hard to convince them to rebel because they knew how the \u201ccongos\u201d worked after independence\u2026\n\nPortugal should walk with its head high for its role until 1974 in the African continent.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/xqyWMVc9Gus\n\nThis was Maputo in 1970\u2026 It\u2019s chilling. This was far far more advanced than Porto, Braga Viseu or any city in mainland Portugal. That was the \u201coppressive regime\u201d\nAnd remember, it was true that white people were at the top of the economic ladder as they had an educational advantage over black people Portugal started its big education reforms in 1930s in mainland and only in 1950s it started in the overseas colonies so everyone there was 20 years behind in primary , high school or university. \nUniversities that the regime built in Angola and Mozambique to support the emerging local middle class in the 1960s \n\nI really don\u2019t blame you. Most people have been told a lie and correcting it was considered a crime\u2026",

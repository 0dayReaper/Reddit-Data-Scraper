This tree of comments is how the ROC considers itself to be the legitimate government of all of China, and has not recognized anyone else as the representative of the Chinese people.\n\nComparing it to the UK - US relationship makes no sense. The US was a part of the UK, they fought a war and at the end of the war, the UK recognized the US as legitimate sovereign entity, and therefore no longer claimed sovereignty over US territory.\n\nSuch a thing has not occurred in regards to ROC/PRC. Both do not recognize each other's sovereignty. That fact does not somehow mean that the UK is the legitimate government of the US as u/Hambeggar was somehow suggesting, as the UK has signed a treaty specifically stating that the US is its own legitimate entity and the representative of the people of the USA.",

Taiwan isn't a country and to the best of my knowledge, it doesn't claim to be, nor does the US government officially recognize it as a country. The situation is far more nuanced than that. Taiwan is China, it's the official governing body of mainland China. Hence why the US fully recognizes the \"One China\" policy as is stated on the US government website. The Democratic government of China, which resides in Taiwan ever since the CCP took over the mainland, still remains the legal governing body of Mainland China, they just don't currently have control of all of the land atm. If I'm wrong about any of this I'd appreciate the correction but I don't believe I am.",

Mainland China, the PRC, would almost certainly take Taiwan by force if they announced independence. And, as you stated, Taiwan does still claim mainland China. From what I understand, the PRC is fine with this because it strengthens their narrative that there is only one China and no difference between the two. That they're just having a little relationship spat, and it will resolve itself with time. \n\nSo It's not that Taiwan is holding onto the hope of reclaiming the mainland, that ship sailed a long time ago. It's that If Taiwan stops making that claim, they will have to either announce independence, or submit to the PRC. They have to go through this charade just to prevent invasion.\n\nBut on paper, Taiwan is completely independent from China and functions just like any other country with their own president, laws, economy etc.",

Then in 1949 it lost the Chinese Civil War and retreated to Taiwan where it launched 40 years of repression under martial law.\n\nThe description you gave in your first comment really describes the view that the Republic of China dictatorship had when it ruled Taiwan. However that wasn\u2019t necessarily the view of the Taiwanese people.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1987 that freedom of speech was respected by the Republic of China and they didn\u2019t have democracy until the mid 1990s. \n\nSince then, the elected governments have been restrained in what the can do by the threats from the PRC and the fear of losing support from the USA (the USA basically tells Taiwan not to change the *status quo*).",

You also know that you're either in the Republic of China or the People's Republic of China, both of whom claim to be the actual leader of the WHOLE of China.\n\nThe ROC has not claimed sovereignty or jurisdiction over the \"Mainland Area\" in decades...\n\nHere is the \"national\" map \"at all levels\" directly from the ROC Ministry of Interior: https://www.land.moi.gov.tw/chhtml/content/68?mcid=3224\n\nHere is the current status quo, [as explained by our Minister of Foreign Affairs](https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1328&amp;s=114527): \n\n&gt;The Republic of China (Taiwan) is a sovereign and independent country. **Neither the R.O.C. (Taiwan) nor the People\u2019s Republic of China is subordinate to the other. Such facts are both objective reality and the status quo.** Taiwan will continue to work together with free and democratic partners to firmly safeguard universal values and beliefs.\n\n----\n&gt;The UN, the US and most of the rest of the world accept the One China policy and do not recognize the Republic of China nor Taiwan as a sovereign country.\n\nThe United Nations isn't a government. They don't have the ability to recognize who is and isn't a country... they are just a group of \"members\". [Directly from the UN](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/about-un-membership):\n\n&gt;The recognition of a new State or Government is an act that only other States and Governments may grant or withhold. It generally implies readiness to assume diplomatic relations. **The United Nations is neither a State nor a Government, and therefore does not possess any authority to recognize either a State or a Government.**\n\nThe United States does not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but they legally recognize the government based in Taipei as the \"governing authorities\" of Taiwan. The Taiwan Relations Act which is binding public law defines Taiwan and the governing authorities as:\n\n&gt;\u201cTaiwan\u201d includes, as the context may require, the islands of Taiwan and the Pescadores, the people on those islands, corporations and other entities and associations created or organized under the laws applied on those islands, and **the governing authorities on Taiwan recognized by the United States as the Republic of China prior to January 1, 1979, and any successor governing authorities** (including political subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentalities thereof).\"\n\n----\n&gt;Start with being honest about that. Then maybe start demanding a renaming of the Republic of China to Republic of Taiwan. Dropping the claim on all of China would make independence for Taiwan MUCH easier.\n\nChanging the name gives China an excuse to invade... keeping the Republic of China name is taking a pragmatic position. It is to not rock the boat... as it does not change the fact that Taiwan is already independent. As I already pointed out, ROC does not claim effective jurisdiction over the Mainland Area.\n\n----\n&gt;What else would make it easier? Not using Taiwan as a propaganda tool against China. It's in the interest of China and Taiwan (you see how easy it would be to turn the colloquial name into a real term?) to not have a war, but an actual solution.\n&gt;\n&gt;China (the People's Republic, which is the ACTUAL China according to 90% of nations on the globe and the UN) could easier negotiate an independence if that doesn't trigger Western dreams of \"China falling apart\" and \"colour revolutions\" and what not.\n\nWhat world do you live in where you think China would accept the Republic of China declaring itself the Republic of Taiwan, and not start a war?\n\nThere is only one party threatening war over the Taiwan issue, it is the PRC.\n\n----\n&gt;Maybe make Taiwan about Taiwan, not about China and the fear of the West of the bad bad Communists. Taiwan is a neat little place and a technological powerhouse, as long as it isn't turned into the battlefield of Western interests against China.\n\nWho is making this about China?\n\nI don't give a shit about China. Fuck China. Taiwan (ROC) is completely independent and separate from China (PRC). If Taiwan becomes a battlefield, that is the result of the PRC not respecting our sovereignty and independence. Don't blame anyone else... China is the bully here.\n\n----\n&gt;So - greetings to the Chinese province of Taiwan. May you find a successful way to avoid regional conflict and an actual way to independence.\n\nI don't live in a Chinese province.\n\n----\n&gt;By the way... I am writing from Scotland, where we fight a very similar battle for an own nation.\n\nThe situation in Scotland versus Taiwan are nothing alike.",

It's what irks me so much about West Taiwan comments as well, Taiwan is the name of the province, and the RoC is the name of the country. If you want to support their sovereignty, at least call their country by their actual name and call the PRC West China.",

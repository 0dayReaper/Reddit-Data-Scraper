Everyone else had a more hardline position on Ukrianian soviegnty. So the territories most endangered by a continued occupation of Donbass (because war with Russia directly really didn't seem like something that would happen back then) voted for the option for a negiatated settlement. \n\nThis is also why basically there is no compromise position left among the Urkainian people since Russia invaded. Russia escalated and invaded and committed mass murder in Urkiaine with the independent politician government most likely to diplomatically settle the Donbass and Crimea issue. And the Eastern regions of Ukriane have borne the burnt of the assaults on the civilian population. So the typically Russophlic Russian Speaking Ukrianians feel completely betrayed and all civilian good will toward Russia is just straight up gone among the population. \n\nIf Zelensky signed an easy peace with Russia now (ir carving to Russian demands) I'd expect him to be hanged publicly by a mob within a month. Even though he ran and won on negoiations and anti corruption to begin with.",

After all, he had grown up Russophone himself (he was \u201cZelensky\u201d before he de-Russified his name to \u201cZelenskyy\u201d) and produced many of his films in that language. Much of that very area is part the part of the territory that Russia recently annexed.\n\nSo, tying back to your original question: there are relatively few ethnic Russians or Russophone Ukrainians in the western part of the country, which is traditionally where Ukrainian nationalist sentiment ran the strongest.",

Majority of them are ethnic Russians who were moved to Ukraine by the Russian government during the USSR/RI eras. Picturing all Rusophones and Eastern Ukrainians as pro-Russian is what Russian propaganda does.\n\n**Zelensky openly stated that he wants Ukraine to join the EU and NATO before he was elected, he wasnt elected on pro-Russian platform and pro-Russian voters didnt vote for him in the first round.** Zelensky closed the most pro-Russian Russia-owned propaganda media after he was elected(and long before 2022), something Poroshenko never did.\n\nNow to the West: unlike most countries, Ukraine has not a single far-right or alt-right party in the parliament. Far-right views arent popular in Ukraine. Go look at your own country, mr.Sicilian, Italy has a right-wing leader from Musolini's party. Poroshenko is himself from the region labeled as pro-Russian by people like you and was won majority of votes in eastern Ukraine in the previous elections.\n\nNazism being popular in Ukraine is a popular myth made by Russian propaganda. Russia literally pays people to pretend being Nazi to have soemthing to report on: https://www.timesofisrael.com/businessman-paid-for-nazi-graffiti-in-ukraine-ahead-of-russian-invasion-report/",

Savchuk won an electoral district as a person. She is the only representative of Svoboda to do so among hundreds of districts.

Trump, who was elected the president of USA, and has a chance to repreat it and/or grow tons of other influential far-right politicians. Le Pen, far-right politician, is currently the most popular politician in France, she finished at 2nd place in French presidential elections with 41% a year ago. Im sure there is similar shit in many other countries.\n\nIf you want to say that far-right ideology is strong in Ukraine because of Oksana Savchuk, then how about all those other countries where far-right ideology is far far stronger.",

It was eventually annexed by Poland in the Middle Ages, and then it went on to have its own cultural, political, ethnic and religious history. Austria annexed it during the First Partition of Poland. \n\nThe 19th century rise of nationalism created a strong sense of solidarity between Poles and Ukrainians, who both lacked a state, although pro-Russian sentiments also still existed in some circles in Galicia, specially among Orthodox Christians. World War II brought a lot of mayhem to the region, which fought a multilateral war (including Bandera) culminating in a violent annexation by the USSR.\n\nBottom line is Galicia has its own history that's even more separated from Russia than most of the rest of Ukraine, which was annexed earlier on. They're closer to the West than the rest of Ukraine, there are more Catholics than Orthodox Christians, etc.\n\nEdit: This reply is as neutral and balanced as anyone can be, don't mind the downvotes. I changed some words that someone might misinterpret if they're looking for a reason to be angry",

The real answer is Poroshenko was a populist approaching the elections from the position of having been in power, with a baggage of failures and less of ability to promise something (\"why didn't you do that already?\"), Zelensky was a populist approaching the elections from never being in politics - all the rest had their run already. Also, Poroshenko angered the owners of many mass-media outlets, so a lot of Zelensky votes are \"anti-Poroshenko\" votes. As one-sided as that map looks, remember, Poroshenko pulled off a pne-tour win in 2014. Zelensky needed the second tour and all other candidates gone for this landslide.\n\nNot only could Zelensky make wilder promises as usual with opposition politicians, he also very carefully tried not to antagonise anyone. Mostly by avoiding any polarised stances himself and having multiple \"spokespeople\" who carefully said different things to different groups of people. If any such person got strong negative response (usually by carelessly antagonising the neighbouring bubble of voters) they were quickly cut loose.",

I hated both of these candidates (still do) sometimes for similar reasons, sometimes for different ones. My main red flags for voting for Zelenskyy were 1) lack of any political experience; from the way he talked about all of his reforms and how he saw his future rulership it was clear the guy had no idea what he was doing and was simply going by the idea of \"I'm not a real political but a peoples person, therefore I will not be corrupt\" (which later turned out to be false with how his party became known today as one of the most blatantly corrupt parties in the whole history of Ukrainian parliament); I am sorry, I don't care how pure your intentions are, but being a president requires more than just good heart which one of our former presidents, Victor Yushchenko (no, not the one that fled the country), has proven, being the most honestly yet the most passive Ukrainian president ever; 2) he is a populist, much like Poroshenko, and given his actor career I'd say even more; I wanted to vomit when I heard that Zelenskyy called Poroshenko to a live debate on a stadium; the way the whole thing was presented made me sick, presidency is not a reality show, this is not how future president should behave (the debate was not even interesting or productive); 3) complete disregard of Russian threat and lack of understanding of the issue; he wasn't doing it out of evil, I don't think, but him saying that he would \"go with Putin out to nature and settle everything\" made my jaw drop; you don't need to hate Russia, Russians, or be anti-Russian full stop, you just need to look at the things logically \u2014 Putin is an awful human, not only he does not care about other nations, he barely cares about his own country; he is a weak, naive, corrupt authoritarian, nothing more; and this war only proven his impotency.\n\nSo for me it was a decision between two evils. Poroshenko being an oligarch and a populist who at least had political experience and (tho for personal reasons) wanted to push further from Russia and closer to EU, and Zelenskyy, another populist, with no experience,  sponsored by an oligarch (Kolomoiskyy), with unclear motives.",

The corruption there is another level and DEEPLY rooted into the society. I paid a bribe 5 times in my life and all in Ukraine and I traveled to USA, Europe (a lot of EE and Balkans too) and Asia. \n\nI can confirm that it changed, because I didnt pay a bribe in last 5 years in Ukrainian border control (it was expected to put some cash in passport so the control does not search your car for 30 min (and the border line is sometimes 5+hrs of waiting). \n\nI got to the doctor because I needed stiches, you put some money to a lady otherwise you wait 6hrs to see a doctor. \n\nCovid - in my GF family all of them got covid passports saying they were vaccinated, but non of them got a vaccine. \n\nWhen crossing a border I also got a fake covid test with my gf... you just needed to pay a little extra on top of the test to not wait in line and get a guaranteed negative test and this was a month before the war. \n\nIs it better in Ukraine corruption wise? I would say yes, things improved. However it is VERY FAR from normal. Imagine how bad it is on top when day to day people paying few bribes a year there. I am deeply concerned when the war will end and the money for rebuilding will pour into Ukraine. There will need to be a very high supervision of these founds in order for them to not go away into the pockets of individuals.",

The Hungarian-Ukrainian border is a mess, but it's always the Hungarian side that slows things down. To me it seems that the Ukrainian state functions way better than the Hungarian, and advancing in a rapid phase. I am currently in Lviv, last time I was here was about 5 years ago, and I'm amazed every day how much it improved since.\n\nI was in Ukraine during covid as well, and there was no covid test at all. Went to the doctor too, never experienced anything of what you wrote. To be fully honest your comment seems very disingenuous.\n\nDoes Ukraine have corruption issues? No doubt, but remember: they have been under Russian rule or in the Russian orbit for the past 400 or so years, and only trying to distance themselves from them since 2014. 9 years will not change 100s of years of societal corruption, it needs time, but they are definitely on the right track.",

Pretending it's 2014 and Poroshenko is still president was much easier for them from a narrative perspective given their shock at the scale of the invasion.\n\nIn some sense the invasion could be said to have prevented a Poroshenko comeback by making Zelensky extremely popular - though the massive, permanent surge of anti-Russia sentiment might make Poroshenko's politics more widely appealing when one gets past personalities.",

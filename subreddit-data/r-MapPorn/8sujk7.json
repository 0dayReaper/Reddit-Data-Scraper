I also dated another girl by that name in my late 20's after my first marriage. The girl I dated for two years before I started seeing my first wife was a 'Brittany'', and the first I girl I dated after the separation was, too.\n\nI talked to my best friend and former roommate a couple months ago that still lives in our hometown and he said, 'Man, you wouldn't believe who I ran into a couple days ago; one of your ex-girlfriends.'\n\nBefore I could say anything, my wife just says, 'Aww, well that's nice. Brittany who?'",

I had this super cool plan: I would probably end up dead before I was like 30-ish, cause I didn't really take care of myself and was a bit self-destructive. And not one bit of that's to sound edgy or cool or r/iamverybadass. It was sad.\n\nI had all kinds of health issues and addiction issues and had already had a heart attack (23-years-old) and I *knew* I'd never take care of myself well enough to last too long. \n\nBut along came this woman. This non-Brittany, nothing-like-my-first-wife woman. I'd have done anything for a woman like that, and I started trying. Trying for her, but *really* trying for me.\n\nThen, along came this other woman. My darling baby girl. The night she was born she fell asleep on my chest and cried like hell if she couldn't keep her little hand in my beard. Now there's three sets of hands pulling on Dad's beard.\n\nShit, now I'm gonna try to live forever.\n\n",

I'd bet you any amount of money in a few years time, we'll be able to see the same sort of trends occurring more recently, with the names of the main characters in \"50 Shades of Grey\".\n\nI guess I'm somewhat lucky in that if I ever have a daughter, the name I'd pick would be \"Hildegarde\". Something tells me that one is gonna continue to be considered obscure until the sun burns out.",

She has such great statistical and sociological insight, while also apparently doing a good job communicating with young expectant mothers. (I'm a gay male professor with no plans for kids, who studies the foundations of probability theory, so I can't really directly comment on the latter part, but I'm guessing she does a good job because that's how she makes her money. I just discovered that [Randall Munroe, of XKCD, also likes her blog](https://blog.xkcd.com/2014/01/31/the-baby-name-wizard/).)\n\nThe biggest general trend is a growing pattern of individuality, where people aim at names that are less popular. You can see this a little bit in that recent years don't have the same name first in every state, but the bigger thing you can't see is that the most popular names in every state now gets given to a smaller fraction of babies than the fifth or tenth most popular names did back in the era of Mary.\n\nSome other particular naming trends she has picked up on in recent years - [raindrop names](http://www.babynamewizard.com/archives/2013/6/raindrop-names) (this is where you get Emma, Sophia, Olivia), [boys ending with -n](http://www.babynamewizard.com/archives/2007/7/where-all-boys-end-up-nowadays) (the Aidans, Jaydens, Cadens, and also the non-rhyming Ethans, Jaxons, Masons, were part of this), [\"andro-girly\" girls names](http://www.babynamewizard.com/archives/2012/9/style-spotlight-andro-girly-names) (this is a spinoff of Madison, turning into Maddyson and the like), and so on.\n\nOne thing she often points out - while a soap opera or TV or movie character can often jump start a name, it'll only catch on if it fits with the current sound/style trends. And even [villain](http://www.babynamewizard.com/archives/2005/3/satans-stylish-spawn) [names](http://www.babynamewizard.com/archives/2011/6/villain-names-so-evil-so-stylish?page=1) will do if they fit the style.",

I'm glad people at least sometimes appreciate the time I spend procrastinating on work by writing comments like this.\n\nAs for American media and it's pro-independence messages, I think that's part of the trend. But I think there's some sense in which that messaging about independence has been relatively constant since at least the early '60s, while the name patterns have undergone major changes since then.\n\nProbably the bigger thing is that parents these days have a lot more resources to figure out what names are common or uncommon, and also to provide suggestions. I'm guessing that in the 1960s, most soon-to-be parents didn't go to the local library or census office to find the list of the 30 most common names so that they could avoid them. And if they wanted a list of baby names, it needed to come from a book publisher, which would mean that a lot of conventional people with conventional jobs and money to invest in a printing press would have to have made the list.\n\nSince the 1990's, it's been easy to get the full Social Security and Census list of the 1000 most common names on the web, so that once you start thinking of a name, you can see that it's actually the 25th most common name in the country right now (which you wouldn't have seen if you just saw a top 20 list published in your local newspaper on the day the list drops in May). Furthermore, once people start seeing that full list (and also starts watching media aimed at niche markets, on cable or the web) people start to realize the full diversity of names that actually do exist out there, both from other languages and from some creative parents that they might love or hate.\n\nAnd after writing this, I realized I should check what Laura Wattenberg has said about it, and I found [this post](http://www.babynamewizard.com/archives/2005/4/the-cultural-accelerator-are-names-really-changing-faster) from back in 2005 that specifically mentions three things - the Black Power movement of the '60s led a tenth of the country to come up with a new set of names that no longer goes along with the rest of the mainstream; creative spellings of existing names have become accepted; and increasing ethnic diversity broadens the pool of names (both because there are tradition-minded people from more different traditions than their used to be, and because Anglo and other traditional American groups are willing to use crossover/cosmopolitan names).\n\n[Also, it's notable that baby names are a place where red staters embrace diversity and creativity while blue staters thump their Bible (names) and ridicule the snowflakes for wanting to be special.](http://www.babynamewizard.com/archives/2008/9/of-names-and-politics-the-palin-story)",

I\u2019m in the U.K. and we had very different naming trends over the decades, e.g the androgynous Madison etc have never been that popular. But just like in the US, more recently feminine and semi- old fashioned girls names have risen even more than usual: Olivia, Sophia, Isla, Ava, Ella, Charlotte, Poppy, Evie (not Eve), Florence, all in the top 20. In general there has been a broader trend of nature/flower names, e.g in the top names list are Poppy, Ivy, Daisy. This is compared to the top names in 2000 in the UK which include Megan, Lauren, Courtney, Caitlin, Jade, Page. In fact out of the top 40 names  -a and -ie, \u2018cutesy\u2019 names and highly feminine names are coming back into fashion. So this must be a rejection of -lynn, -son and general\u2019y non-stereotypical feminine names from the early 2000s?",

You put the **entirety** of the territory solely controlled by the SDF (I see what you did by ignoring their shared control with the Syrian government) as \"US occupation\". This alone utterly destroys your argument and makes me *mighty* suspicious of your agenda.\n\nIt doesn't help your point that, by your linked article, they are 900 hundred soldiers in all of Syria (so also the southern region of **actual** US occupation), and they are only occupying oil fields in the Deir ez-Zor Governorates, not all of the SDF held territory.\n\nSo. No. Outside the Southern region there's no US occupied territory in Syria.\n\nThere are oil fields occupied by the US. But that's a **very** different thing to occupied territory, which is what tou're saying with this map I suppose as a way to discredit the SDF as US puppets and little else (ignoring the fact that they are allied with the Syrian government since the Turkish invasion of Northern Syria).",

If that was the case then Southern Spain and all of Poland would be occupied y the US. The direct control of the territory through these bases is what would constitute a military occupation.\n\nAnd, in the territory shown in your map as \"US occupied\", the territorial control is done by the SDF, not the US. Thus not making it an occupation.\n\nIf anything, not  showing the entirety of  the SDF territory as occupied breaks your argument entirely. If the SDF control of a territory isn't \"US  occupation\". Then the rest of the SDF-controlled territory shouldn't be considered as such. As they are literally the same exact organization.\n\nOr do you think that they are two completely different institutions by some deranged reasoning?\n\nAnd. Yes. The DPR/LPR  were (and still are) occupied territories because they were directly controlled by Russia. Transnistria and South Ossetia aren't occupied by Russia because their governments still have some level of autonomy that the DPR/LPR didn't have.\n\nThey are unregnozied **satellite states**. Not occupied territory.\n\nSomething that you cannot even say about the SDF, as they are literally aligned with the Syrian government.",

Nobody is suggesting that the US is stealing Syria\u2019s oil to take back to the US; but it\u2019s likely true that they are deliberately occupying them in order to prevent the Syrian Government becoming energy independent and to deny them a source of income, along with stopping the spread of \u201cIranian influence\u201d.\n\nYou\u2019re right about IS tbh; there are still fighters out there but mostly concentrated in the desert controlled by Syria. The primary victims these days are Syrian soldiers (conscripts, 18-21 mostly) being kidnapped and murdered in the desert. If the US\u2019s biggest priority is to eliminate IS, their refusal to work with or even talk to the Syrian Government is absurd",

You *could* take the position that the Syrian Government is not legitimate and therefore Russias presence is illegitimate, but the vast majority of the world, the UN, and the practical realities on the ground would disagree. The world has moved on from \u201cAssad must go\u201d\n\nBut again, thanks. I do appreciate the sentiment. I think the truth is inconvenient for people. I never mentioned Russia, although I think people (rather sensitively) assumed I was justifying one occupation with another.

To say that territory has been annexed in plain English is to say that it has now been incorporated into the domain of the occupier. The administration of civil law and not martial law is a good standard for when the occupier has now defacto incorporated the territory in terms of administration. However if I still don't accept that the territory is now a part of the domain of that country then I still wouldn't say that they (edit: have legitimately) annexed it. Borders are not unilateral divisions and it matters when other countries start recognizing an annexation as such.\n\nYou claim this stuff to be well-defined and regulated by international law and yet in the instant example we have here, the Golan Heights, has been administered by Israel since 1981, and yet still the UN's perspective is that it is Syrian territory which has has been under Israeli military occupation since 1967.

Let\u2019s simplify things, shall we?\n\nOccupation vs Annexation ( we are talking about de-facto, here) has nothing to do with international support and everything to do with the legal system the area is under. If it is under the civil law of the country controlling it, it is annexed; if it is under military law, it is occupied.\n\nThe Annexation of the Golan was rejected by the world, that is true, but the citizens of the Golan don\u2019t live under Israeli military law, but rather under civil law. That means it was annexed without being recognized. \n\nThe Palestinian territories are either under no Israeli law (Gaza), or Israeli military law (the West Bank), therefore they are occupied. The only exception is indeed East Jerusalem, but you were talking about \u201cthe annexation of palestina\u201d - would you like to argue that all of Palestine is only East Jerusalem? You would make the Israeli right incredibly happy.",

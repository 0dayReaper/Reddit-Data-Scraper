    "postText": "Of Israel\u2019s many accomplishments, one of the most impressive may be the reforestation of the land. From the turn of the twentieth century a huge amount of work has gone into planting trees and turning the land green.\n\nSince 1900 roughly 250,000,000 trees have been planted across Israel and it is the only county in the world that ended the 20th century with more trees than it had in 1900. In 1948 roughly 2% of Israel was covered in trees and this has now grown to around 8.5%.",

Whole forests of just Aleppo pines would destroy the other plant life because the pine needles would cover the entire forest and make other plants grow impossible \n\n2. Aren\u2019t like other native plants like the oak and the pistacia Aleppo pines can\u2019t regrow after fires so when Israel was hit with giant forest fires the pines wouldn\u2019t regrow \n\nToday the JNF tries to plant more diverse varieties of trees and is cutting sick Aleppo pines",

Sometimes that war flares up and sometimes it simmers, but it\u2019s all one war. Similar to say the Korean War. Hamas is a very new organization, as you say they only won an election in 2007 (and then never again). Yet there was violence for decades before that and have continued to be violence since then. That violence was started by one thing: Israel\u2019s colonization of the Levant, and continuing expansion onto Palestinian lands and expulsion of the indigenous population. Everyday Israel continues this violence by stopping these people from returning to their homes through state violence. \n\nThe Gaza Strip elected Hamas because they\u2019d been radicalized by this war for generations, and the 2005 pull out only served to confirm their claims that violence was the only way to stop Israel. Hamas was the only option for most people at the time, because Israel systemically destroyed left wing groups and organizing in Palestine and supported radical right wing Islamist groups instead\u2026 like Hamas. While the PLO was openly corrupt and seen as ineffective and useless. This is not to say Hamas is good or even effective, they aren\u2019t. I\u2019m not here to defend them. However I am saying that they don\u2019t exist in a vacuum, and are simply the result of Israel\u2019s actions over the past 80 years and refusal to stop their colonization. And now because the only people left to stand against them are a terrible fascist terrorist group, they basically have no opposition to colonize the entire West Bank, which most of the current government wish to do. That\u2019s not going to bode well for peace there. And it\u2019s all on Israel.",

But the Islamic groups were far worse.\n\nThose expulsions only happened because of the founding of Israel, they were reprisals for Israel\u2019s expulsion of the native peoples of the region. Now those expulsions were awful and shouldn\u2019t have happened, and the Arab states bear responsibility for that, but they would not have happened had Israel not been created. Jews and Muslims lived in relative peace for most of their history in MENA. It wasn\u2019t perfect obviously, but it was a lot better than Europe. There\u2019s no reason to believe that this decent relationship wouldn\u2019t have continued and improved had Israel not been created.\n\nFurthermore, one wrong doesn\u2019t justify another. Imagine if in 1948 million of Jews moved to millions like Guyana or Somalia: kicked most of the people living there out, and stole their homes. That wouldn\u2019t be justified. It doesn\u2019t just become justified because it happened in the Levant instead.",

They weren't committing any attacks or trying to leave Gaza, they were just minding their own business in their own fucking country and Israel still murdered and maimed thousands of them. That's not border policing, it's state terror.\n\n&gt; And Hamas isn't fighting occupation\n\nGaza is not an independent city state and it was never granted independence, Israel withdrew the IDF and relocated the settlers to the west bank because they figured out during the 2nd intifada that Gaza was an unviable target for colonialization due the population density. Israel kind of let Hamas run wild within Gaza during the disengagement but began the blockade pretty much immediately, the border walls were built right before the IDF pullout, tax theft, and sweeping sanctions were put in place against all of Palestine after Hamas's victory during their parliamentary elections but before they started lobbing rockets and Israel. If you look up a timeline of the pullout and blockade you can see what happens was less \"Israel frees Gaza then Gaza attacks Israel\" and more \"Israel gives up on colonizing Gaza but continues the occupation indirectly and uses economic pressure to force Fatah into attempting a coup against Hamas, Hamas preempts this and gets mad at Israel/USA, Israel/Egypt blockade Gaza\".\n\n&gt; (which, if it really were peaceful, would later probably been joined by the West Bank to form the country of Palestine)\n\nThey're literally not allowed to do that without Israel's say so because of the Oslo Accords. Right now all of Palestine is technically under the rule of the Palestinian Authority which is a state like entity that's supposed to become a proper Palestinian state after negotiations with Israel complete. Fatah controls the west bank and effectively runs the PA because they won the presidential elections and sidelined the parliament which alongside Gaza is still controlled by Hamas. They're not divided because one side is peaceful and one side is violent, they're both violent as fuck, but because of ideological differences and because the west will economically kneecap Palestine if Hamas takes over.",

The IDF would have been allowed to maintain bases in the west bank while the Palestinians would have been granted basically zero control of their foreign policy, airspace, international waters, borders, or be allowed a military. American states have more independence than that. The Palestinians backed the Arab Peace Initiative which is basically what every other country in the world has called for at the UN, two fully independent states along the 1967 borders with some refugees getting back the land that was stolen from them during the Nakba. A far cry from the \"all Jews must die\" caricature. \n\n&gt; Here are some other noteworthy peace meeting or proposals from Israel to the rest if the Arab world, which were rejected\n\nThis is a pretty laughable thing to go on about in 2023, the Arabs have all normalized ties with Israel besides Syria.

Rabin explicitly stated that his plans were for Palestine to become \"[something that is less than a state](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/pm-rabin-speech-to-knesset-on-ratification-of-oslo-peace-accords)\" annexations of land beyond the legal 1967 borders. Every leader Israel has had since has demanded more land and less autonomy. Olmert was not an exception, his early offers not only involved a demilitarized Palestine but one that would be [occupied by America as well as Israel.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehud_Olmert#Prime_minister_of_Israel) It was only after everyone said no to this he \"offered\" to unilaterally annex 10% of the west bank and east Jerusalem while giving the finger to Nakba refugees. This \"offer\" was widely unpopular in Israel and made right before election season which is why the Abbas was hesitant to accept it since if he agreed to go along he could have been left holding the bag as the guy who gave away Jerusalem and stuck with an Israeli government unwilling to go through with it. \n\n&gt; (and we Israelis don't want to be those that manage those)\n\nYou did until they started bombing you. After the intifadas you people went from \"palestinians don't exist, Gaza and the west bank are ours forever\" to \"ok wow everyone needs to chill out we just want to coexist maaaaan\". Fatah was an Egyptian student organization before the occupation of the west bank, Hamas was a non violent charity org before the occupation of Gaza.

Arafat starts the second intifada and a year later changes his mind.\n\n2008 - Olmert offer, rejected\n\nHere's a video (in the article) where the chief palestinian negotiator explains what was offered in 2008. Hamas have tried to agree to boundaries Despite media attempts to portray it as a new Hamas charter, it is not. The new 'policy document' accepts the creation of a Palestinian state in 1967 borders, but still rejects Israel and claims its territory.

But many states did that mistake and similarly Israel will learn from that mistake. Hopefully it will also learn from other mistakes. In many cases you cannot call it re-forestation, since there were villages on that ground, and one purpose amongst others was to avoid the natives to re-settle and erase the history. Looking from the view of the zionist movement this was reasonable to do back then. But it still has a non erasable aftermath.",

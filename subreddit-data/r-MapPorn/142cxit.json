Some of these places still have ancient forests. This is also the reason for the small population in the old days.\n\nAs a resident of Kazan (the capital of Tatarstan), I will say that we (residents of Kazan) like to go to Mari El precisely because of the forests. They are pristine and very beautiful there. That is, we live in a large developed city, but literally 80 km to the north - and there is no civilization, there is only a dense forest around. I don't know English well and I can't find the right word to describe what forests are in Mari El.\n\nThere are many hills covered with agricultural fields in Tatarstan. Forests are much smaller than in Mari El. Although if we compare with the average Europe, we have a lot of forests :)\n\nThere are even fewer forests in the Samara region and the Ulyanovsk region, and the steppe begins in the south of these regions. There are also chalk mountains in the south of the Ulyanovsk region.\n\nIn the Perm Region and in the Sverdlovsk region, the ancient Ural mountains are overgrown with forest. That's very beautiful. There are really a lot of minerals there, but I would not want such beauty to be ruined for the sake of their extraction.",

We are American and went on this trip with my family to Norway (beautiful country) that summer, and she and I broke off to visit our friends in Seoul. It was their last year living there so our last chance to visit. Anyway, we traveled to the DMZ and as we were looking out to North Korea, I joked and said we'd only be one country away from my family in Norway.\n\nWe also flew to Korea via Moscow which was mildly scary, but we basically flew over one country most of the day.",

That doesn't make sense.\n\nCanada and Denmark/Greenland could come to an agreement and split the island in half. This is what Sweden and Finland did with the island M\u00e4rket; until Finland messed it up and built a lighthouse on the wrong side, so now the border is weird. But still; that's the choices:\n\n* Claim the whole island and be in a dispute with Denmark/Greenland and **not** have a border\n* Claim half the island and give away the other half, and hopefully come to an agreement with Denmark/Greenland and then have a border with them.\n\nThe tradition of sharing drinks and switching flags can still remain. You got for example the Pheasant Island which for half the year is Spanish and the other half of the year is France. Having traditions like these are possible. But to have a border, it must be split, so the France\u2013Spain method does not work here.",

The result is the overall continent roughly retaining its shape as continent. Countries that are much more exposed to the sea like Japan or Italy are much smaller than say China or Iran, so impact the map less. Russia and India are exceptions, but they are still surrounded by a fair number of countries so our mind maintains that mental image of the original map over them.\n\nThen there is the US, Canada, Mexico and Australia, which just take the entire continent from coast to coast, and barely touch many other countries. That's where this land/sea balance breaks down.",

One of Spain's divisions is called \"Basque Country\" so there's that too.\n\nThey also claim that they were split in the past and are part of a union now.

Higher infant morality, meaning you have more children to ensure some make it to adulthood, less access to family planning and birth control, more reliance on subsistence farming which requires kids to assist with farm work, and no or weak social safety nets meaning you need children to support you in old age. \n\nAs living conditions improve, people have less kids. Over the last half a century Africa has improved significantly, and as a result life expectancy is rising and fertility rates are falling.",

Meanwhile economic growth is lacking, resulting in a GDP per capita loss when the region should be absolutely booming economically like the Asian tigers did in the 20th century.",

Since most of the land mass on earth is in the northern hemisphere, having a projection focused on the north pole removes a lot of distortion for the the majority of land on earth. Granted the southern hemisphere gets tweaked to look like there is an ice wall, but I have always thought it was interesting to see just how close the continents are centered around the arctic ocean.",

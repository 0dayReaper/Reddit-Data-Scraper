The way they move energy is less by raising the surface of the ocean, and more by transmitting a wave through the entire water column.\n\nAs the Tsunami approaches the shore, the water gets shallower and that energy is concentrated. Since the energy has nowhere else to go, it forces the water upwards and onto land.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm a hydrographer not a physicist, so this explaination might not get an A+ on a physics exam. I think it has to do with the waves being pressure waves. Surface wind waves are a different type (don't remember the name, but they have orbital motion).",

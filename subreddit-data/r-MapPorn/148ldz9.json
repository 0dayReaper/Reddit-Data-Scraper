Because it effectively stops unwanted births you get a compounding effect over time and a pretty huge normalization at a higher average age over time. \n\nNot saying we should do differently but there are long term economic and social consequences of this that probably haven\u2019t been fully realized.",

Let's accept this for a moment. What about men who don't have families? Should they be paid less? Won't that make it harder for family men to find employment since their services are more expensive? \n\n4) What about married but childless men? Should they get paid more than bachelors? What use is their hike in salary if their wife also earns?",

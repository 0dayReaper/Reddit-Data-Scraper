It's not just a straight line that someone drew on a map. \n\nI think you're being pretty arbitrary in saying that the connection between Africa and Asia doesn't count because it's smaller. The point is that it's there. And if you want to take culture into account, North Africa and the Middle East are far more similar than Europe is to surrounding regions of Asia. \n\nGoing by any definition of continent aside from continental plates is arbitrary to some extent. The definition of Europe is fairly arbitrary, but it's not much more moreso than the others.",

But it has also changed throughout the centuries, at one point it was considered the Don River or the Irtysh River, or the Volga River. It was constantly changing *because* there is no clear border and the idea of Europe as a continent is based on culture rather than geography. \n\nThat is far more arbitrary from a geogrpahic standpoint than drawing a border at a 120 mile wide strip of land connecting Asia and Africa or a narrow isthmus connecting North and South America",

If you do it that way, you have the Americas, Africa, Eurasia, Antarctica and probably just Australia (instead of Oceania), to stay consistant with the chosen definition. So 5 continents (not sure why you'd have Eurasia but keep South and North Americas).\n\nBut there are other things to geography others than just purely purely physical concepts. Continents as ideas have a long history. This is the reason why we consider Oceania to be a continent for instance. But it's also why we talk about \"middle east\", and formely about \"far east\", \"levant\", \"near east\", east and west Europe, Mitteleuropa, etc etc.\n\nI don't think it's a very good idea to just ignore the history of how we divide the world, unless of course there's a reason for it. Like if you're making a map about coastlines, it doesn't make sense to separate Europe and Asia.",

Conceptually it makes as much sense to grant the Indian subcontinent or the Middle East/North Africa the status of a \u201ccontinent\u201d as it does Europe, it just so happened the people in charge of making those divisions coming into the modern era were European",

I think this has to do with the way IMF considers costs. \n\nThe IMF uses FOB for exports and CIF for imports, while I believe standard practice is to use FOB for both (the IMF also has a paper from 2020 on why FOB should be used for both but doesn\u2019t follow it). So data is skewed due to shipping price discrepancies (ie. it\u2019s cheaper to ship from China than from other places, etc.) and other extraneous costs. \n\nExcluding all those costs, and looking at total economic volume of goods traded, China appears to be the largest trading partner for Germany, with the U.S. at #2.\n\nEdit: I cross referenced with the World Bank and the WB does exclude these costs in determining the largest trading partner. So the raw IMF data that was used doesn\u2019t actually display \u201clargest trading partner\u201d. It actually shows \u201clargest trading partner + costs of trading with them\u201d. As the post title is \u201clargest trading partner\u2026\u201d, using the raw IMF data is incorrect.\n\nTLDR: Map is wrong.",

Although there are many reasons why the government is close to Russia and far to the west, I can count three main reasons.\n\n1- to get the support of the people (watch the second article)\n\n2- The West supports many terrorist organizations in the Middle East and wants to dominate the Middle East.\n\n\u00b0 Support to PKK, YPG, PYD.\n\n\u00b0 ISIS, founded with the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n\u00b0 The anti-Western, Ayatollah-led Iran that emerged as a result of their exploitation of Iran led by Reza Pahlavi.\n\n\u00b0 interfering with the internal affairs of many countries is the biggest reason for these\n\n3- the invasion of Anatolia during the great war and the treaty of sevr\n\nAnother reason is that Turkey is in a really bad economic situation and western countries impose sanctions on Turkey.",

I just mean; What did the Turkish people think?\n\n\nHere are the answers to your statements:\n\n&gt;Turkey is supporting the terrorist in syria\n\nThe only organization that Turkey supports in Syria is the FSA, and this organization is supported many western countries, and many people from within Turkey support the withdrawal from Syria because Turkish soldiers have losses. If the government changes in the near future (second round of elections), we will completely withdraw from Syria by making an agreement with Assad and returned all refugees in our country by agreement.\n\n\n&gt;withoud their support the war would be over years ago\n\nthe war would not end because the FSA is not the only organization inside Syria. The war is not over yet, but fighting has stopped.\n\n&gt;it also carries military activitied without iraqs permision\n\nWhoever said that operations are being carried out without Iraq's permission have deceived you, my friend. The operation is carried out together with the Kurdistan Autonomy, within the framework of the permission of the Autonomy.\n\n&gt;and supported Azerbaiy\u00e1n and their warcrimes not to mention their involvement in cyprus\n\nI don't want to get into this topic because if I do, this discussion really won't end\n\n&gt;lybia\n\nwe are there under the permission of the government by the government fully recognized by the UN.\n\nIf you don't like our government, I don't like it either. You just don't love what you see from the outside but these people have been making life hell for me since I was born\n\n\nfuck Erdogan",

I'll add the bit that comment needed for context, and I'll try to walk through some of the more general stuff to answer your question after.\n\nBack before the EU, Ireland was much more dependent on the UK for trade - and the UK used it as a weapon in politics (see the Anglo-Irish trade war for a fairly nasty example of slapping crippling tariffs onto Irish goods because the Irish wanted independent arbitration on a treaty term to do with debt). As a result, there was a distinct and necessary emphasis on broadening trade ties once Ireland moved out of its protectionist economic phase.\n\nThat covers off the intentional \"diversification\" bit.\n\nThough that's only part of the answer - the more general stuff you need to round it out properly follows. Bit scattershot, but hopefully of use.\n\n11% isn't really a low number. That's still quite a lot - both Ireland and the UK have each other in their top 10 for both exports/imports despite not being massive markets on a global scale. It just looks disproportionately smaller than the counterpart export because of what gets wrapped up together into the figures.\n\nWithout getting into the fine detail of it too much, government figures on imports/exports (which these look like to me) typically include both goods and services not just goods. Around half of the UK's exports to Ireland are in the form of services rather than goods (traditionally you'd have a lot of UK companies not setting up an Irish office, or supporting their Irish office from the UK and billing back because of the difference in population). \n\nIn trade goods terms, Ireland and the UK actually have a relatively equal import/export balance with one glaring exception. That glaring exception is fuel - Ireland's fuel supply for gas and petrol predominantly comes from the EU through the UK, and it's massive at around 10 billion or so.\n\nExports/Imports are done on cash value. There's a lot of trade links between the UK and Ireland but once you get outside a handful of industrial ties, it's a laundry list of small value goods - food, paper, textiles, and consumer goods. Stuff you'd notice if it disappeared, but not stuff that has big impacts on trade balance individually. \n\nIn contrast, the USA buys something like $50 billion of Irish Pharma/Chemicals, another $10 billion of electronics and a bunch of high value prestige drinks/foods (which don't sell for as much on the UK market). Same story in the UK - the UK sells a lot of heavy industry gear/vehicles to the USA (like $25 billion worth) as well as a list of weird niche specialist things in big quantities (antiques and jewellery are both multi billion quid industries). Neither Ireland nor the UK could serve as a market for that much of the other's specialist goods.\n\nSo, yeah, it's not that the UK and Ireland lack trade ties or are particularly imbalanced. It's just there's a lot more to it than the raw % suggests.",

Even if the goods are transported per ship you will anchor in the Netherlands and then transport goods by train or truck to the north, east or south through Germany. If it goes to Hamburg, or Bremen it arrives directly in Germany. Due to the terrain of the Alps in the south and the booming economy in the region of Westgermany, France, GB and Benelux all ways go though Germany at some point. Why are people even surprised? lmao\n\nQuit your tinfoil hat crap and realize that there is nothing surprising about this. Germany has by far the biggest population in the EU, the infrastructure is massive and the economy rises since WW2. Take Germanys many many big companies and huge workforce into account and you will realize that this picture is just logical.",

The vast majority of which are users not dealers.\n\nThailand has one of the harshest drug related laws in the world. The justice system is so clogged up that many inmates spend months in jail before their trial. The over incarceration is so bad that pardons are handed out left and right to make room for incoming inmates. \n\nI know this is anecdotal, but I have a relative which had their sentence knocked down to 4 years for \u201cgood behavior\u201d and royal pardons. The crime? Premeditated double murder, triple if you want to count the pregnant one as a double.\n\nWe even had a serial killer get released early not too long ago who, surprise surprise, immediately went back to killing the exact same kind of people as before.\n\nAll so we can pay ourselves on the back for putting the junkies in prison\u2026",

Apart from that there was/is a big push by some businesspeople for the legalization of weed for medicinal, tourism, and economic reasons. \n\nTo be honest the way the previous Thai government decriminalized weed was soooo bad that the new government (which some consider to be the progressive camp, but Thai politics doesn\u2019t fit into the Anglo-centric left-right politics that well; it\u2019s more of a democratic vs military and elite kind of deal) are seriously considering criminalizing weed again so they can properly regulate it. Or just make it completely illegal again, it\u2019s really up for debate at this point.\n\nThe issues I see being brought up often in the media and politics are:\n\n- Time and point of sale (having a weed dispensary next to a school is not great look)\n- Creating a standard for what diseases and symptoms can be treated with weed (in addition to modern medicine)\n- The import and export of weed\n- Taxation and licensing (like alcohol, tobacco, and sugar)\n- Advertisements of weed products or products containing THC and CBD\n- Public health education on how to consume weed responsibly \n\nThe list is quite long because current regulations are purposefully left vague because they weren\u2019t meant to be permanent. No legislation could really be passed because parliament was too busy dealing with Covid and by the time the situation had become *normalized* the previous governments approval ratings were taking such a nose dive that parliament became dysfunctional from finger pointing and infighting. Hence the lack of proper legislation concerning weed, heck the Narcotics Bill hasn\u2019t even been amended. \n\nBut it\u2019s such a controversial topic and the stance on weed doesn\u2019t follow coalition lines (both camps have parties which are either pro or anti legalization) it will probably be hit with a quick fix which isn\u2019t complete criminalization. I\u2019m short everyone agrees the current status quo is not great, but no one agrees what the correct approach should be.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m very obviously in the decriminalization camp and a lot of people within my social and professional circle agree. I do think the sale of weed should be more like sex toy shops in some European countries. It\u2019s obvious to a customer, but discreet enough that the general public doesn\u2019t care.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention that it was a key campaign promise from the BJT which is the slimey opportunistic snake of Thai politics. The \u201cconservatives\u201d had to cave in in-order to have a functional parliament.",

It's an umbrella term for the native religious practices and beliefs of much of the Indian subcontinent. I think the better conclusion to draw is that no matter what religion is popular, a good chunk of its followers will be shit at following it, and a dangerous chunk of its followers will use it for their own gain.",

Or get pissed off at Chinese international students when they're not suddenly converted to liberalism when some debate bro shouts 'whattabout weeger socialcredit xinnie the poo tianmen?'. \n\nWhen people in the west criticise America, there's a bit more nuance. 'Oh, it's because of xyx, not because America itself is the problem'. That benefit of the doubt is never given to China, and as a Chinese social media user, there are MUCH more nuanced takes on the US than they grant to China. But still, the news about attacks on Asians is well known, the clips of right-wing nutjobs ranting about China taking away their penises, or even just clips of Kensington, Philly can paint a picture of a country that is mentally unwell and not a country that China should be looking up to (as they once did). \n\nThe freedom to go to school, walk down the street in any part of the city, or even gathering in public without fearing for your life is a different kind of freedom. The CPC isn't going anywhere any time soon. There is no silver bullet to solve China's problems, and most Chinese people have no trouble with the government. \n\n&gt; If China is such a prison, it's weird that people go on vacation and come back home. And they're free to immigrate too. Some do, but obviously the vast majority doesn't.\n\nTo the point where there was even a hate sub called r/chinesetourists that got banned. In fact, the biggest barrier for exit for Chinese people is the visa for the destination country.",

One aspect to consider, though, is that the shape of the arrays affects ones perceptions of the area contained, that is, a 2x10 array has a different perceptual size than a 4x5, even though both arrays have the same square count (20).",

The reason I like it so much is that it retains the familiar shapes of the US states while emphasising their relative importance in the electoral college. People have posted quite a few distorted maps and I can see the appeal, but as a non-American I have a really hard time recognising states when they're not their usual shape.\n\nThe other thing I like is the way this map shows up the disconnect between land area and electoral college votes. The big empty spaces around the coloured squares in the middle remind us just how misleading the maps which simply colour whole states are.\n\nNice work, keep it up! I hope you get to have a good break now that the election is called.",

The election that happened on November 3rd was not a single election it\u2019s 50 election to elect electors. These electors are referred to as the electoral college. These individuals will travel to DC around mid December and cast the votes that actually elect the President.\n\nI believe about half the states have laws requiring their electors to behave in a certain way, most they do demand all the electors vote in accordance with the states popular vote, some like main split it. Traditionally electors will vote in accordance with their states popular vote even with out a mandate by law. \n\nSo to answer your question we do not have 50 different voting system for a single election, we have 50 elections that is masquerading as a single election. \n\nPlease tune in next week where a non expert explains things.",

They send the results with paperwork to DC. \n\nCongress looks at the paperwork and adds its own round of certification and paperwork on top. On January 6th congress meets to look at the results. If one candidate gets an absolute majority, congress declares him the winner. \n\nIf there's no absolute majority, congress is free to totally disregard any and all results of the election, and elect anyone they think should be president and vice president according to whacky rules. \n\nhttps://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11641\n\nSeriously, the Holy Roman Empire had a simpler and more effective system than the United States",

The 4/6/4 above doesn\u2019t feel strange on the tongue, only feels weird if you count them out and are a stickler for the 5/7/5. \n\nThe system is developed for a language that doesn\u2019t have the same length as English, and is used more as a way to teach about syllables in English than about the spirit behind what makes a poem a poem. Hard to quantify but some things feel like haikus even if they might not strictly be.",

Sometimes they're not pronounced clearly or they combine with another symbol to form one syllable, and sometimes kanji are used which can have more syllables.\n\nBasically the rule isn't to do with 'syllables,' but a part of Japanese grammar that has no real equivalency in English.",

If elections went directly by popular vote, slaveholding states would have had far less influence than Northern states over elections because an enormous portion of their population was enslaved and unable to vote. Keep in mind for context that [by 1860 roughly 60% of the population in South Carolina was nonwhite](https://www.sciway.net/afam/slavery/population.html) and therefore unable to vote, and in cities like Charleston enslaved people outnumbered white people by something like 3:1.",

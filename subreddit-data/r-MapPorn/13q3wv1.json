There's been a century, if the Irish elite wanted it preserved they could have adopted any number of methods that other countries used for language revivals.\n\nThe Irish talk a big game about their heritage and cultural institutions but they leave for other countries whenever the going gets tough. There's legitimately not the mentality there for them to properly adopt the culture necessary for it. The government cares more about housing foreigners than the Irish youth, and recent polls have 80% of under 30s planning to leave the country. There is just not the societal will to actually have conditions to adopt Irish, let alone get a million foreigners to learn English AND Irish.\n\nSingapore has had mass adoptions to where society has switched languages 2 times since independence. Southern Chinese Dialects -&gt; Mandarin -&gt; English\n\nIsrael invented modern Hebrew through an artificial language revival to get Arabic, French, Ladino, and Yiddish speaking Jews to learn a common language.\n\nThese were both scenarios where there was kind of no where else for them to run and they had to adopt a common culture and I don't think Ireland's foreign focused government will ever respect or value its commonfolk enough for that.",

I attribute the whole thing to misguided assumptions that people would speak the Gaelic they learned out of pure nationalism, and laziness on the part of the authorities in terms of trying to implement any kind of comprehensive plan for linguistic revival. Irish became a symbol rather than a practical form of communication.",

They had 40 years to drill Gaelic into the school system in an effective way, and instead they largely relied on rote memorization and beating you with rulers if you failed to pay attention to their extremely boring and unhelpful linguistic program. Reminds me a lot of Japanese English classes, in that these programs were designed by academics who didn't actually speak the language they were designing curricula for all that fluently. Few if any native speakers were consulted on the curriculum, it was basically the equivalent to learning a language from a textbook and never engaging with anyone who spoke it.",

In Ireland it's just called Irish, as you say. \nIt can be called \"Irish Gaelic\" when stressing its status as a Gaelic language, but \"Irish\" on its own is unambiguous, whereas \"Gaelic\" on its own is no longer the conventional English name for the language.\n\nHowever, when you say \"no one calls Scots Gaelic just Gaelic\", that's simply wrong. It's quite common (especially in Scotland, and to some extent in England) to refer to Scottish Gaelic simply as \"Gaelic\". The reason for the different convention is that you can't abbreviate it to \"Scots\" or \"Scottish\", because this would be confusing, given the existence of the Scots language.",

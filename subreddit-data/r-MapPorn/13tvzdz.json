Mate is drunk either cold in hotter regions or hot during the Southern winter, but isn't the breakfast and office staple coffee is. Unlike coffee, it's kind of a ritual, it takes time to prepare and to consume. You can bring mate to work, but it's a bit weird.",

And the quality is really expensive. All while there are plenty of ego centered pseudo coffee experts who exploit a FOMO industry to sell shit beans as \"specialty\".\nTea on other hand has long lasting tradition in quality and you can clearly taste the difference. That's why for example the best coffee nations atm are again in the east, where tea was and is still tradition and quality. Western is like hipster looking dudes with tattoos on a bike pretending to know what a good coffee is \ud83d\ude05",

In Brazil the South drinks a lot of mate and even elsewhere it is a common drink, specially cold. Add that to the fact Brazilian's coffee serving sizes are small, I can believe that \"tea\" is drunk more than coffee.\n\nBut that is just misleading and a result of grouping different things when they shouldn't. Brazil doesn't have a tea drinking culture. When you go to someone's house you will be offered coffee, not tea. At work you will have a coffee break.

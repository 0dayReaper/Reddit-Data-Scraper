We were visiting Scandinavia with my family and spent most of the trip in Norway. For the next half of the trip we flew from Bergen to Seoul via Moscow to visit friends who have been living there for the past five years. It was the last few months of their time there so we decided to go then or it would never happen. On that leg of the trip, we visited the DMZ, technically touching the North Korean border. I laughed and told my wife my family was just two countries away.",

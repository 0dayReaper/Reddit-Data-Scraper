And right-wing people are far more likely to be ready to fight for their country(in any country). While liberal Russians who are against Putin rarely are ready to fight, they just move to the West and criticize Putin from there, often criticizing Ukraine and the West as well.\n\nIf you know any Russians with perfect political views who are ready to fight for Ukraine, please contract Ukraine, Ukraine will be happy to have them. If you are ready to fight for Ukraine yourself and help guard the border, for example, this is also easily done. For example, here is an interview with a British dude who fought for Ukraine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3mm5OXS1mY\n\nUntil then Ukraine will have to do with inperfect soldiers that are available.",

Example of them bombing civilians before 'the escalation into Russia': https://www.timesofisrael.com/21-killed-in-russian-missile-attack-on-ukraines-uman/\n\nRussian 'partizans' attack Russia for a month already. Where is the Russian response? Why no escalation and consequences? Russia already fights as hard as they can.\n\n&gt; The only way this will end is at the negotiating table. Ukraine is currently in a very good position; we need peace\n\nThen go and negotiate with Russia that they return to the internationally recognized borders. Or you want Ukraine to just give up the territory that Russia conquered by starting a war?\n\nThat kind of negotiations happened in 2014, guess what happenes next? Russia makes ethnic cleasings of territory they conquer(so they can claim that the new demographic situation supports them) and then make a next attack after some time when they are ready. If Russia broke the previos 'peace deal', what makes you think they wont attack Ukraine again in few years? Are you ready for you yourself and your country to join the war on Ukrainian side if Russia just breaks the 'peace' again? No? Then why the fuck what you suggest should matter?",

Afghanistan no longer houses any US soldiers, while in Iraq their presence is limited to 3 military bases, with no control over environs.\n\nThe US doesn't occupy a substantial part of Syria, where did you get that idea? Their occupation is limited to Al Tanf and supposedly some oil fields in East Syria. I do think that their occupation there is illegal and should end as soon as possible though. Syrian oil belongs to Syria, not the US.",

The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are over, so you\u2019re indifferent to American soldiers, and so when the war is over in Ukraine (either way) you\u2019ll just magically stop being racist and bigoted? Bigotry and racism can be justified now? That\u2019s news to me.\n\nAnd yes, the US occupies about 1:4 of Syria. If you give me 5 mins I can post imgur links of their substantial bases in Syria and their airbases under construction. Make no mistake; it will prove you wrong. So, you want to dead Americans too?",

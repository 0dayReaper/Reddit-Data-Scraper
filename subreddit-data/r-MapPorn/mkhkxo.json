At one point you see a road (leading to a highway) is available on the right side of the road you're on. You would get a sign \"Small Town\" showing the direction of the road you're on, and a sign \"Autres directions\" pointing to the road that intersects with the one you're on.\n\nHope this helps.",

But only when, like, you're in London and want to head to Nottingham, or Dublin and want to head to Limerick, so there's only a small selection of roads and one goes North, and then more roads happens and another is the road South out of eg Dublin and then you'll reach the point where it divides into roads going to Waterford or Cork or Limerick. But initially its just telling you that if you want to go somewhere that is in the northern half of the country this is the wrong road to be on because there won't be any branches or minor roads splitting from this that will ultimately head north.\n\nThough my personal favourite was in Lyon, where there was a sign saying \"&lt;=All Directions - All Other Directions=&gt;\" \ud83d\ude02 Well, in French, but ykwim.",

However in this case the smaller circle is inside the bigger circle and they only intersect in exactly one point.  \n\n\nHow do we know this? Well streets usually don't go all over the place and span an entire area, they are usually a single line.  \nAlso when viewing a street sign it shows the cities in one direction only.  \nThis means you are actually looking for the point at which both of those circles intersect with the line that is the street. (well sort of... road signs show street distances not direct distances so on a street that is not jsut a straight line things get even weirder)",

As in it specifically refers to road signs giving information on the distances to the locations, whereas you can find other signs that don't offer distance information and are simply there to tell which lane you need to be in, or \"take the next exit for A B and C\", which sometimes aren't listed by distance.\n\nFor example, the Belgian \"distance\" signs are clearly in the [farthest first format](https://i.imgur.com/8SMmN4s.png), but this other \"stay in lane for these destinations\" sign is in [no discernable order](https://i.imgur.com/oiJHOAH.jpg)... Antwerp is furthest (55 km), then Brussels (51 km), then Kortrijk (36 km).",

On the one sign the city that\u2019s furthest away is at the top and then the closer cities are at the bottom while the other sign states the closest city first (which I guess would make sense so you see when you\u2019re close). Now the countries that use the first type of sign are marked red, the other ones blue. However the map is wrong as Germany for example uses the second type of sign but is marked red.\nEdit: Apparently I\u2019m wrong about Germany which I don\u2019t even know how I got that wrong",

Look [here](https://verkehrszeichen.kfz-auskunft.de/verkehrszeichen_richtzeichen3.html) for Zeichen 453.\n\n/u/gauna89 has a good list of examples that contradict this though. My next best guess would be according to [this Wiki page](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildtafel_der_Verkehrszeichen_in_der_Bundesrepublik_Deutschland_seit_2017#Richtzeichen_nach_Anlage_3_(zu_%C2%A7_42_Absatz_2_StVO\\)) (again Zeichen 453). It seems that this are the rules since 2017.\n\nDigging a further deeper it seems that [in 1974 the signs were changed](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildtafel_der_Verkehrszeichen_in_der_Bundesrepublik_Deutschland_von_1971_bis_1992#1974) and then [again in 1988](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildtafel_der_Verkehrszeichen_in_der_Bundesrepublik_Deutschland_von_1971_bis_1992#April).\n\nSo my best guess is that it used to start furthest to closest in the same highway and then from furthest to closest again through other highways. Since this was confusing they first removed it and then somewhen redesigned it to include the white line. In any case old signs are still valid and were not updated",

The latter also hailed from other regions though, too, including Normandie and \u00cele-de-France (Paris).\n\nSo there was overlap, though the Acadians were more likely to come from that one region of the central west.",

They did a poutine festival in Lewiston a few summers ago at the Franco American center or whatever it\u2019s called, I\u2019d say 75% of the people aged 50+ were speaking French. The trends are not good going forward when it comes to preserving that culture but it\u2019s still there.",

Not in Denmark however, where there was already freedom of religion at the time the Mormons arrived. Here they were allowed to stay, so all the missionairies that were sent to Scandinavia ultimately ended up in Denmark.\n\nAs a result, Denmark sent disproportionally many immigrants to Utah compared to other European countries. There were simply so many missionaries gathered in one country to speak of Zion and its glory. Danish surnames are still very common among Mormons.",

Interestingly, the branch that was set up in Preston by those early missionaries remains (according to wikipedia) the oldest continuously functioning branch of the LDS church. Established in 1837, it predates even the Mormons' arrival in Utah; at that point in time, Mormons were established in Ohio and had not yet made the cross-country trek to Utah. Lancashire's history with Mormonism, then, predates even Utah's history with Mormonism.",

The name comes from a diminutive of *marquis*, a French title of nobility, ultimately from a Germanic root meaning \"border\" from which we also get the word \"March\" as in \"the Welsh Marches\"\n* Nisula - last name of an early Finnish settler. Not sure about the etymology, but *nisu* means wheat and *-la* tends to denote a place name, so I'm guessing it's something like \"wheat farm(er)\".\n* Vulcan - Named after a local iron ore mine, which was named for the Roman god of fire &amp; the forge (for obvious reasons), from which we also get the word \"volcano\". \n* Cheboygan - shares its name with the Cheboygan River and Cheboygan County. Thought to be of Ojibwe origin. As with many place names of Native American origin, the etymology is uncertain. It could be from *zhaabonigan*, \"sewing needle\", or it could be from *Chabwegan*, \"a place of ore\".",

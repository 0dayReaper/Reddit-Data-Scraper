(e.g. who is considered a \"French deceased person\", basically)\n2) wouldn't it make more sense for the colour scheme to correspond to the percentage of the population that died instead of the absolute number? I feel like the percentage might have been more significant during and after the war, but I'm speculating.\n\nEdit for 1): I can't read, apparently, since the map literally says it counted the colonies too for France and Britain. I'll see myself out lol",

Unless you wish to extend the use of 'colony' to the point of it being a sloppy, vague term which is applied without proper consideration. England is a colony of Normandy?

Then each country is given the percentages they earn by having implemented those laws.\n\nBelgium has a high percentage, but they haven't made it to 100% because they didn't ban conversion therapy, among others. Turkey is very low because their legal system has less of those laws in place. However, they earned a few percentages by allowing people to change their name, among others. \n\nhttp://www.rainbow-europe.org/",

If it is, their religion is wrong and in fact, unconstitutional.\n\nNo one said that this map is constrained to institutional and formalized governmental actions, part of the discrimination can come from homophobic private members of society and it's still considered a relevant factor.

Even if it punish them in some way, this is not going to change their beliefs.\n\nYou could apply this ironclad logic to anything in life, really. Why would the government try to educate people about the risks of having unprotected sex? Why would you try to discourage smoking? The government has a power to set the tone of public discourse, and the signals they send matter a lot in discouraging vile people from being vile just for the sake of it.\n\n&gt;It's just an opinion as long they don't cause any violence.\n\nAbsolutely no point to making these statements without knowing the actual nature of the 'hate speech' in question. You are blindly defending something here, and you don't even know the first thing about it. That's pretty much arguing in bad faith. Yes, someone could have expressed their opinion that homosexual couples should not receive church blessings on their marriage. That would be freedom of speech. Or someone might have said that according to them gay people should be killed. That would be hate speech. Hate speech is not part of the freedom of speech because inciting violence against other members of the community is in itself violence and a criminal offence. You don't know what happened, what they are referencing, you are just pig-headedly defending your country.\n\n&gt;Churches are free to exercise their freedom of speech according to Patriarch of Constantinople.\n\nThe Patriarch pf Constantinople doesn't make the laws of Greece.\n\n&gt;I declare their research as a bs. \n\nYou are free to do so, as it falls within the freedom of speech to express your opinion but if you want people to actually take you seriously maybe publish your own research first. It's very clear that you couldn't even be bothered to open the actual report, so it's hard to understand based on what you believe your opinion matters.",

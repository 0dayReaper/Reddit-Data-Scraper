Intuitively I feel that it IS wrong, but logically I can't find a reason.\n\nAnd as for genetic defects, see my comment below. Genetic defects (apperently) only occur if incest is done repeatedly over multiple generations, so incest in a single generation doesn't produce them.",

Which is just absolutely stupid. You could say the same thing about homosexuality. It's the 21st century, it's time for society to realise that just because we condemned something for the past doesn't mean we were right to do so.\n\n&gt;There\u2019s often other problems with incest that commonly exist, abuse, coercion, manipulation, power imbalances, age differences, financial reasons, and while that doesn\u2019t make up 100% of cases, they coexist enough that we can make a pretty general assumption that relationships between closely related people don\u2019t end well for those involved, especially if one is in a victimized position.\n\nThat's why it's super important to say \"consensual\" incest. Abuse, coercion, manipulation, power imbalances, age differences, financial reasons, all of those are valid concerns, however in no way do they apply to incest exclusively. They apply to all relationships. Even when you partner is not your sibling you can be abused, manipulated, there can be power imbalance, age difference etc. I don't think that's a valid reason to make this specific kind of relationship illegal and allow all the other ones where this issue happens.",

I again don't see how that proves that incest is wrong though.\n\n&gt;Other than that, that\u2019s one of the times where \u201cthink of the children argument\u201d is 100% valid\u2026 children from incest aren\u2019t exactly healthy.\n\nSee I used to think this as well and used this as an argument for why incest is wrong, because it leads to genetic defecrs if it produces offspring. However, it was pointed out to me recently that incest only produces genetic defects if it's done repeatedly over mutliple generations. So if you have kids with your sibling, those kids have kids with each other and then those kids have kids with each other, THEN genetic defects would start showing up. But if you have kids with your siblings, they are fine and as long as they don't do incest as well, their kids will be fine too.\n\nTo be honest though, I haven't actually read any studies about this, it was just said to me in a discussion and I took it as a fact because I trust the person who said it. Feel free to fact check me on this and if it turns out it's not true, then the children argument is absolutely valid and I'll admit that incest is wrong. If what I've said is true though, I don't see any reason why consensual (emphasis on that) incest is wrong.\n\nAlso if children is the only reason, then same-sex incest should absolutely be legal, right?",

Although I don't entirely see the difference between that and raising a 12 year old in a house where their parents are fucking each other. Or in a house where their sibling is fucking their partner for example. But I will admit that these situations aren't probably fully analogous to the one you gave.\n\nSo okay, I'll give you that, incestual relationship is problematic in a family where multiple siblings live in the same household and only some of them practice incest. But let's say the situation is different, we have two adults who already live on their own and they are siblings. Is there anything wrong with the having a relationship?",

Even the Weimar Republic was not sanguine about Poland, and once the Nazis were in power no real accommodation was possible. And of course none would have been possible with the USSR without conceding national independence. Better than national extinction under Nazi rule, but that required a little foresight. \n\nTheir position would only have been tenable if they had succeeded in both getting bigger right away and there had been a prospect of faster industrial development. Even then, they did probably all that was possible. Without real French commitment to war with Germany when the time came, Poland was always screwed.",

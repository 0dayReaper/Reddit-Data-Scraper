Even then that person won't have anything left to save for retirement or unexpected medical expenses or a vehicle breakdown. The dollar has lost a tremendous amount of value due primarily to two very bad decisions: \"quantitative easing\" and rushed business loans with virtually no credit checks in the wake of COVID, and the economic sanctions put in place against Russians after the Ukraine invasion. First we flooded the country with easy money, and then the sanctions meant to cause Russia pain ended up hurting us more when a large portion of the global wealthy who trusted the dollar for many reasons saw what might happen to their dollar stored wealth when the US disagrees with them politically. They watched as the Russian oligarchs could not access their US dollars stored in Swiss or other countries banks, and those who could would convert from dollars to yuan or yen. After watching that happen, most decided to swap out their stacks for a better currency. So now the dollar is no longer the most trusted store of value across the globe it once was. Everything we import will cost more and exports will sell for less. Weaponizing your currency only ends up hurting you, and for a long time.",

I can take a train and be in Austria in 2 hours, enjoy the Alps, from there take a train to Rome, and then Paris. All pretty close to each other, completely different cultures, beautiful cities and so much history. I just wouldn't trade all that for money.\n\nPlus a lot of Americans don't like immigrants, and you're always a foreigner in that country. Honestly I'd rather be a foreigner in another EU country, stay closer to my family and friends, and keep all the things I love about Europe. Other Europeans would probably treat me more like an equal than Americans. A friend of mine fell in love with an American and married him, but he didn't want to move to Europe so she ended up living in NYC, and people aren't really nice to her.",

US is divided into 3000 countries, almost all crime happens in just 2% of them, the other 98% are unbelievably safe.\n\n-US has amazing natural beauty and a population of 330 million, different states have completely different cultures. For natural beauty, look at the Grand Canyon, Rocky Mountains, Sierra Mountains, Lake Tahoe, Yosemite National Park and hundreds of other landmarks, it\u2019s truly the most beautiful country in the world.\n\n-For treatment of immigrants, you have the exact opposite understanding. US right-wingers are definitely xenophobic but nothing compared to Europeans. US is incredibly diverse and accepting.

I was just trying to provide some context because I think some of your assumptions are a bit off the mark about Americans' perceptions of foreigners and especially New Yorkers.\n\nI'm also sorry for your friend's experience, although I find it quite hard to believe that all the Americans she's met think she married for a green card. Perhaps a few said an offhand remark that stuck with her - doesn't seem like a basis from which to conclude that New Yorkers of all people don't like foreigners. Especially considering that there's an absolutely massive Slav diaspora here (literally entire neighborhoods of the city speak primarily Russian interspersed with Ukrainian). And especially these days, Americans in general are massively supportive of Ukraine. \n\nI'm sorry if she has felt in any way unwelcome, however.",

If Alabama was an independent country, it would do far worse than Greece without all the effect from places like Cali and New England.

You said that only Norway and Switzerland are better than the US.\n\n&gt; than eastern and southern Europe by every metric\n\nThis is not really true. Your mentioned Greece has a life expectancy of 80 years, Italy and Spain have it at 83, while its only 77 for the US. Even Croatians and Czechs live longer than Americans. How much of your salary would you give to live 5 years longer?\n\nThen the difference in salaries isnt as big as raw numbers suggest. You compare average income instead of median income. Cost of living is lower. Expenses like healthcare or cars for each adult family member. Then Americans are expected to work more and longer for that pay, often outside of their working hours, and have no paid vacations. And if something happens to you, then you are just fired and on your own.",

Professional jobs often have just as much as in Europe - it is just not mandated by law. If you are fired for anything except gross misconduct, you will be eligible for unemployment, and you can collect for quite a long time, although not indefinitely as it seems in some EU countries. \n\nProfessional jobs also generally come with paid medical insurance. The expense comes in deductibles, but it's not as if most professionals are paying out of pocket completely - they aren't.\n\nIf you are truly poor in the US, you will have completely free medical care. You will pay nothing at all. In the Northeast, the cutoff in most states is somewhere around 23k per year for an individual. \n\nThe safety nets are not as good or robust as Europe, but they tend to be misunderstood by Europeans, as well.

Just as your comment was implying that **nobody** in the US has that.

We have a shitty social policies (although not a total absence of them, as seems a popular misconception here), but alleviating these issues is not a snap-of-the-finger type of job. If you know anything about US politics, you know that it's not exactly a direct democracy \u2014 it is quite flawed and the will of the electorate is not often put into motion very easily. \n\nI also don't really take your point that European cities are so gloriously integrated. We have vast hotels being used to house migrants and homeless in New York City in some of the more expensive parts of town. Most new development is required to have low income units. I personally live on a decent Brooklyn block, in a building of mostly young professionals, but at one end is a public housing project (people paying nearly free rent), and at the other is an entirely Hasidic Jewish building in which the avg family income is also extremely low by NYC standards. \n\nI've been to most European capitals and lived in two. Most countries with decent diversity there have somewhat ghettoized capitals. Berlin, Brussels, And certainly Paris and London are not paragons of integration. I'm not saying the crime-filled areas of certain US cities are comparable; I'm simply saying that a lot of Europeans on Reddit very obviously don't have much real experience with the US, yet seem to see their own social failings through a special kind of rose-tinted glasses.",

Most Orthodox people in Estonia are from the immigrant populations from the Soviet occupation, namely Russians (74% of all Orthodox), Ukrainians (6.5%) and Belarusians (3.5%).",

The population of the largest city, Auckland, is ~1.5 million; half the population of the North Island, and a third of the whole country. The second largest city is Christchurch which is ~350,000. If New Zealand is listed as without a primate city, the definition seems quite ambiguous.",

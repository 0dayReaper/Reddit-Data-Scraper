IIRC It has to do with diet, culture (running to school/ general toughness instilled by the culture), and their ankles. Apparently having slightly smaller ankles means they have to move less weight with each step which really adds up over 10,000m. I don\u2019t have time to listen again so I might be off. It\u2019s been a while.\n\nHere is the episode:\n\nhttps://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/runners",

All these combined make for good runners.",

                    "comment": "**There's a lot of misinformation and weird correlations presented in this thread, so as someone who has lived in Kenya for a while, lets get down to the truth and what we can actually prove.** \n\nThe truth is, it is that reality is complicated and there are likely a few large factors that help East Africans excel at longer distance running. \n\n1. Genetics: Long distance running is a game of efficiency. A 1% advantage in running efficiency will make the difference between a Gold Medal athlete and someone who barely qualifies for the competitions. \nHuman physiology is highly adapted to the locations and environmental factors that different cultures evolved in. For example people who lived in colder climates favoured a stockier build that can conserve heat, whereas people who evolved in warmer climates favour a lankier and thinner frame that has better heat loss capabilities and ability to sweat more effectively.\nCompare the build and features of someone from Mongolia or an Inuit/ Greenland native to Nilotic people from Sudan, Cushitic People from Somalia  or the Kalenjin from the Rift Valley in Kenya. \nA thinner build with lighter ankles, feet and smaller torsos really help runners to be efficient and shave off that one percent in running efficiency. There is a reason sprinters look like bodybuilders and marathon runners look almost malnourished\n\n2. Location: People in these areas in Ethiopia and Eastern Kenya especially live and train in high altitude areas above 2000m or ~6000ft. Growing up there and living there in a location where children and teens are free to run around a lot more than if you lived in a dense city helps develop better running form and talent from a young age. \n\n3. Support: Distance running is a serious cultural entity and taken on as a sport by many children growing up. When you see and hear about marathon runners from your area excelling at the world stage, you are pushed to try running from childhood and it becomes a viable life path for many young runners. Government support and training camps continue to bring in more talent and keep the medaling history going.",

Therefore you will find both unusually short and unusually tall people in sub-Saharan Africa, for example.\n\nAnd you will find people with great genes for sprinting and different people with great genes for long distance running (they are not the same genes). This is also true of people with sub-Saharan heritage who no longer live in Africa, like Jamaican sprinters.\n\nThere should also be people who have unusually *bad* genes for running, but you'll never hear about them. The average should be the same, but the bell curve is bigger and the extremes are more distant from the center. And in running, if all else is equal, even a tiny genetic advantage can be the difference between 1st and 16th.",

            "comment": "\u201cSince the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, Kenyan and Ethiopian runners have dominated the middle- and long-distance events in athletics and have exhibited comparable dominance in international cross-country and road-racing competition. Several factors have been proposed to explain the extraordinary success of the Kenyan and Ethiopian distance runners, including (1) genetic predisposition, (2) development of a high maximal oxygen uptake as a result of extensive walking and running at an early age, (3) relatively high hemoglobin and hematocrit, (4) development of good metabolic \"economy/efficiency\" based on somatotype and lower limb characteristics, (5) favorable skeletal-muscle-fiber composition and oxidative enzyme profile, (6) traditional Kenyan/Ethiopian diet, (7) living and training at altitude, and (8) motivation to achieve economic success\u2026\u201d \n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22634972/",

I'm not paying the $25-30 for the full-text, but from the part of the abstract where they *do* discuss their findings (emphasis mine):\n\n&gt; In general, it appears that Kenyan and Ethiopian distance-running success is *not based on a unique genetic or physiological characteristic*. Rather, it appears to be the result of favorable somatotypical characteristics lending to exceptional biomechanical and metabolic economy/efficiency; chronic exposure to altitude in combination with moderate-volume, high-intensity training (live high + train high), and a strong psychological motivation to succeed athletically for the purpose of economic and social advancement.\n\nFrom what I can gather without paying $$, \"somatotypical\" just means they're long &amp; skinny, which probably has some genetic basis, but nothing they could pin down. So a few environmental and social factors that they're fairly confident of, and some physical characteristics that don't have a *definitive* genetic basis.",

Its just physics; for a bipedal organism, there exists a spectrum of shapes &amp; ratios that will be better at specific actions than others.\n\nIts also different to talk about running versus other sports. \n\nTo say that \"all X people are better at Y sport\" is reductive and likely to be untrue, especially because more complex sports, like football, basketball, etc., have a variety of roles and a variety of ways you can excel in those roles. \n\nRunning, by contrast, is literally doing exactly one motion again and again and again. \n\nThere *will* be body types, shapes and compositions that will be better at that than others.\n\nIn areas where there isn't much genetic drift in the gene pool, and the gene itself (like running) had a strong evolutionary advantage (humans hunted by running down larger prey over long distances), you're going to see that set of genes expressed and continue to be expressed.\n\nTo me a combination of genetics and the culture that teaches stoicism and resistance to pain primarily explain this. \n\nThe resistance to pain absolutely comes into play, which we can see in individuals with CIPA, people who are born without the ability to experience pain. \n\nThey can be extraordinarily effective distance runners, regardless of their body shape and ratio, because a huge part of why we slow down &amp; stop isn't a limitations of the muscles, but a psychological reaction to the pain the body feels.  \n\nPeople who don't feel pain will just, run, continuously, without that limitation.  They're very, very rare, and AFAIK there's no one with CIPA in the Olympics, but there are reports of dominant high school distance runners with CIPA, because they just simply never slow down.",

Hell, Prefontaine would've come 4th in the NCAA 10,000m final in 2021.\n\nTraining methodology, understanding of nutrition and recovery, equipment, and even track surfaces have changed way too much for a PB in an endurance event set in 1974 to still stand. Also, Prefontaine was obviously an incredible athlete and may have had an international career to put him in contention for the GOAT American distance runner, but he wasn't really a generational talent who was all but guaranteed to dominate internationally, and even the folks who were generational talents of his era have been eclipsed by subsequent generations and so on.\n\n[https://worldathletics.org/athletes/\\_/14352946?competitorid=14352946](https://worldathletics.org/athletes/_/14352946?competitorid=14352946)\n\n[https://www.worldathletics.org/records/all-time-toplists/middlelong/10000-metres/outdoor/men/senior?page=6](https://www.worldathletics.org/records/all-time-toplists/middlelong/10000-metres/outdoor/men/senior?page=6)",

It'd have placed around 40th in the Mens olympics at Tokyo - and would have won every marathon before 1952.\n\nHe's got an unreal capacity for recovery &amp; training.

Although the circle is much larger and doesn\u2019t encompass 100% of the runners, I think it is arguably more impressive. Being that gold medals are not given to the \u201cbest players\u201d of the sport but only to the one winning country. Silver medalists from Russia, USA, Italy, and Greece were certainly some of the best at their sport but are not represented on that map. That is not the case for All-Time 10,000m map which includes a time recorded in 1993.\n\nAn interesting similarity, which was the top comment on the [Repost](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/mksc58/all_mens_olympic_gold_medal_winners_since_2000_in/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) , is that there is only 1 country that is completely confined within the circle but contributes no athletes to the map (Djibouti, Bosnia).",

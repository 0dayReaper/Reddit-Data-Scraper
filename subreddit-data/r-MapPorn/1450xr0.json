(Yes, a shortage. In case you didn't realize the day the invasion strated the length was almost as wide as the length for Operation Barbarossa. The Axis had 3 million, compare that with Russia's 200k. With casualties and retreats, Russia still needs more soldiers to hold frontline).\n\n[With 1 &amp; 2, Russia basically can afford putting few manpower along the Kherson front]\n\nNumber 3: Ukraine had begun multiple probing runs, determining where were Russia's weak points in the frontline (can be signaled as the start of the counteroffensive).\n\n&gt;but if their forces were caught the hardest then it would make no sense for them to have been the ones to blow it in the first place. No military force is that stupid.\n\nThey friendly fired their own plane with jamming devices, they time and time again made an offensive in a zone that resulted in devastated casualties in Kharkiv oblast, they had their AA weapons being destroyed by small drones (later BT2 turkish drones), they had few radios some even relying on their cellphones (making possible for Ukraine to locate their positions), they took a photo of the HQ where a russian lieutenant was... put it on social media and got Himars'ed... \n\nThey are learning from their mistakes... At least that much is evident.",

Pakistan wasn't a thing any more or less at the time than India, but bringing up bronze-age civilization along the Indus river and trying to apply a reference to that separately to either India or Pakistan is a fool's errand.

The Bible is full of Sanskrit and Tamil loan words including that of - cinnamon, emerald, sapphire, topaz, ivory, peacock, rice, mulberry, cotton, millet, pepper and other various spices. Other comments here are obsessed with the semantics of how the Indus Valley Civilization has little to do with modern India. But pointing to literary analysis highlights the connections between the regions. As you can see much of this has to do with trade given the nature of the loan words. Some scholars even argue that King Solomon was particularly interested in Queen Sheba as it would help shore up the trade route to India. Whatever the case - India and the Levant are closer than you think. \n\nSource: My Masters Thesis\n\nFurther reading: https://www.jstor.org/stable/42942895?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents",

However, the history of the lands that compromise the idea of \u201cIndia\u201d stretch back to the dawn of history. And indeed, some of these lands are mentioned in the Bible. \n\nThe important thing to keep in mind is, India as a consolidated nation or country has never existed until the modern day. Historically, it was always a world unto itself- a subcontinent comprised of a myriad of related, but distinct, nations and cultures which at times were joined under the banner of some far flung empire or another. Really quite similar to the popular conception of \u201cEurope\u201d. I hope that puts into context some of the conversation about India and Pakistan in this thread, and why the references in the Bible pertain at the same time to both and yet neither specifically.",

This was originally written in Hebrew, but we only have the Greek translation. The word is something like \"Galatians\" in the Greek, I assume that the context makes it clear that these are \"French\" Celts, and not some other Celts.\n\n&gt;...when I go to **Spain**. .... So, when I have completed this, and have delivered to them what has been collected, I will set out by way of you to **Spain**;  (Romans 15:24, 28)\n\nAgain in Greek: \"Spania\". Seems to have been used for the Iberian peninsula.",

If it would be about specific mentions many of these countries did not exist when the Bible was written and are most likely not mentioned in new translations of the Bible either. These include Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and France. Yes, you could argue that Arabia is mentioned, but that could refer to many other areas of the Arabian peninsula.\n\nIf it is about specific places, then why is there no Jordan? The river is mentioned numerous times, often when someone is crossing it. If you cross it you would have been in modern day Jordania at either end. The kingdoms of Ammon, Moab and Edom (partially) are all parts of modern day Jordania. There is probably plenty more. \nAlso Armenia is also missing with mount Ararat.\n\nI like the idea of the map, but it needs to be more consistent.",

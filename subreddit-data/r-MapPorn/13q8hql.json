If spent any time in that office I owned income tax to that state for those days. My company issued me a W2 for both states. \n\nIf your home state has income tax and your work state does not, then you probably end up paying income tax to the state you live in but if both your work state and state of residence have income tax then your state of residence will typically not tax you again if you already paid income tax to the state you did the work in. \n\nSome of this varies state to state.",

Austria is, as far as countries go, rather on the tiny side. *Maine itself* is a bit larger than Austria, despite having less than a seventh of Austria's population. Maine, compared to the subdivisions/provinces of most countries, is rather on the small side worldwide. That said, both have a city named Vienna (or the local transliteration). Maine's is more of a crossroads with a goofy sign, but that's about right for central Maine.\n\nI lived smack dab in the middle of the state and still drove to New Hampshire to buy liquor once a month. You can cross coastal Maine in about 3 hours. You can cross Austria's lowland areas in about the same time. It's not a big place, as far as places go.\n\nThere is much about the US worthy of critique, to be sure. But folks finding basic geography facts as a reason are just grasping at straws.",

And people from elsewhere, especially those who have never been have a super negative opinion on it. But once you talk to people from alot of those states there are alot of things besides the weather that are better than other places. Many of the Great Lakes states are also known as the rust belt. They also have alot of large, highly ranked public universities to recruit from. So there is a tendency to associate those places with high competition for limited numbes of jobs (even if this isn't always the case). I've never heard someone say they are moving to Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, or Illinois because that is where all of the jobs are (you do hear that for Georgia, Nevada, Utah, Texas, Arizona, etc.). \n\nI live in Michigan, and like a good Midwestern acknowledge its faults and don't have the reflexive my state/region is the best like most southerns seem to have.

Plus, it's not like innocent people in Gensokyo are eaten regularly either, I doubt Yukari kidnaps innocent humans (maybe rarely) and she's not really evil or malicious either- as some Youkai only do this to survive, keeping the natural order of things while also protecting Gensokyo's humans and keeping the peace with them. While some victims truly deserve it, at least in their eyes.\n\nThey're not complete sociopaths either, except for a few- go read the official mangas, they're somewhat wholesome and show that most of the human, lunarian and youkai girls are good and caring people deep down.\n\nTouhou is just equally dark as it is lighthearted.",

(Although he would have been right on top of that ridge, just NE.)\n\nHe was among the USGS vulcanologists studying the mountain, successfully resisting official pressure to reopen the park. He believed that the eruption would be lateral, rather than straight up like a Hawaiian-style volcano, based on measured bulging on the mountain\u2019s flank. He was right. On May 18, 2.6 cubic kilometers (!) of rock collapsed down the slope, releasing a massive pyroclastic flow. Johnston got off a radio message, and disappeared.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t even supposed to be there that morning. He was filling in for a colleague.",

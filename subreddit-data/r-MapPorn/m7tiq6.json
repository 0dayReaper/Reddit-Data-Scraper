I.e. there's no reason to think \"John of Patmos\" is in any way related to John the Apostle brother of James the  Greater, other than that they both had the extremely common name \"John.\"  Plus there's \"John the Elder.\"  Similar things happen with Mary (Mary Magdalene getting conflated with Mary of Bethany just because they're both named Mary).  \n\n\nThere seems to be a typo on this map, I think John is supposed to read \"know for being the brother of James\" not \"the brother of Jesus\"?  Perhaps the mapmaker has confused James the Greater (brother of John) with James the Less (brother of Jesus) and thereby thought John and Jesus were brothers?  Or maybe it's just a typo?",

And then the writing style and quality of the Greek in the Gospel is way better than the Greek in Revelation, so it could have been two separate authors.",

The writer of the Gospel, on the other hand, was writing in Greek and utilizing very sophisticated, highly educated themes that the disciple John simply would not have been able to convey. \n\nOn top of this, the practice of writing texts while identifying as historically important people (the pseudonymous tradition) was very popular in early and Medieval Christianity and resulted in a large number of gospels written, supposedly, by basically everyone in Jesus' social orbit.",

And I agree with the \"sophisticated, highly educated themes\" that you mentioned, which is evident in the opening verses of John called the \"Hymn to the Word\", among other features of the text. \n\nAnd yes, that does explain the many gospels that are non-canonical, as well as the many other books of the canonical Bible (which varies by denomination). There's Deutero-Isaiah, and the question of whether Saint Paul did write the Epistle to the Hebrews or if it was a disciple of his (I read that it was possibly even a woman who wrote that particular one).",

Here is a rough age of death for the ones I found...\n\nThomas was supposedly 71 years old when he died in India. Peter lived to his late 60's in Italy. Mark made his early 60's at minimum. Paul was mid to late 60's. Matthew was writing letters from Egypt in his 70's. Andrew was in his late 50's or early 60's. Bartholomew doesn't have a specific date of death but supposedly went to India with Thomas and returned to Turkey after Thomas's death, so he was likely in his late 60's or early 70's. John, big boy, made it to over 100 depending on what source you pick.\n\nIn short, they mostly lived long lives.",

The church in China was founded by a Persian named Alopen in 635. \n\nMarco Polo described going to mass in churches all along his route through Asia, and condemned them for adhering to Nestorianism, the belief that Christ was both God and Human, rather than a unification of God and Human, a distinction which apparently mattered back then, and which the Western church deemed heretical in the 400s. \n\nMongke Khan was a follower of Christianity, and several Yuan emperors after him until Ghazan converted to Islam and the Ming emperors banned foreign religions.",

                    "comment": "Aethiopia is modern day Ethiopia, not Georgia.\n\nOK, so I and I'm sure a few others are pretty confused about the different names for seemingly the same things. So, let's make some things clear:\n\n* The continent of Africa as a whole was called *Libya* by the ancient Greeks and Romans. The Romans called what is now modern Libya and Tunisia *Africa*. \n\n* *Aethiopia*, basically, refers to the region south of Egypt. This includes Kush/Nubia (modern Sudan) and Ethiopia in ancient times; eventually, this would include most of Sub-Saharan Africa (I vaguely remember seeing an old map with *Aethiopia* being used to name central Africa).\n\n* *Abyssinia* and Ethiopia was used interchangeably as names for the \"modern\" country of Ethiopia throughout history. *Abyssinia* was more widely used in Europe until modern times.  \n\nedit: looking at the Wiki article for Matthias, it says:\n\n&gt; \"The tradition of the Greeks says that St. Matthias planted the faith about Cappadocia and on the coasts of the Caspian Sea, residing chiefly near the port Issus.[4]\n\n&gt; According to Nicephorus (Historia eccl., 2, 40), Matthias first preached the Gospel in Judaea, then in **Aethiopia (by the region of Colchis, now in modern-day Georgia)** and was there stoned to death.[2] An extant Coptic Acts of Andrew and Matthias, places his activity similarly in \"the city of the cannibals\" in Aethiopia.[a][5] A marker placed in the ruins of the Roman fortress at Gonio (Apsaros) in the modern Georgian region of Adjara claims that Matthias is buried at that site.\n\n&gt; The Synopsis of Dorotheus contains this tradition: \"Matthias preached the Gospel to barbarians and meat-eaters in the interior of Ethiopia, where the sea harbor of Hyssus is, at the mouth of the river Phasis. He died at Sebastopolis, and was buried there, near the Temple of the Sun.\" \n\n~~So, the Wikipedia article is likely wrong. The region of modern day Georgia has never been referred to as Aethiopia in any source I'm familiar with, and none of the sources for the article say so either. It should probably say that Matthias *went* to Ethiopia and died in Georgia.~~\n\nTurns out I didn't read the article fully. The Aethiopia mentioned here refers to an account by Herodotus in which there was ancient Egyptian military outpost in modern Georgia. Thanks u/BegbertBiggs and u/Konstiin for pointing that out! :)",

Rabbit hole, here I come!\n\nEdit: Alright so there's a paper by Hyde Clarke about an egyptian colony in the Caucasus, and I no longer care enough to keep reading it. But it's neat. it seems that there's a possibility that scholars believed that there was an egyptian (and therefore Aethiopian) colony in the caucasus, and thus may have called that area Aethiopia because of that; but it also sounds as though modern scholars have found no actual proof. Some of the 'evidence' in the original paper is phonological, though, so who knows! Interesting read if you want to take the rabbit hole I'm sure.",

Crucifixion kills basically by slow suffocation and fluid fills up around the heart and lungs. This was their primitive way of telling whether the criminal was dead. \n\nE: \u201cThis\u201d being the lance stab to the side. If clear fluid instead of blood came out that indicated they were dead\n\nIf they wanted to kill them faster they would break their knees so they couldn't pull themselves up. This didn't happen with Jesus as he had died, but his two friends had their knees broken.\n\nThe real excruciating bit was the nails though. Despite popular art it was through the wrist, not the hand. The nerve this went through is the same nerve that makes your funny bone hurt when you hit your elbow and would've hurt... bad.",

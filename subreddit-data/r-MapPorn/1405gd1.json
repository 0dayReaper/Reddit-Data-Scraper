            "comment": "Hi Shevek99\n\nThis atlas is one of the finest pieces of cartography I am aware of. I've used mine so often for teaching that the binding let go of a number of pages. Myself neither speaking Czech nor Slovak, most of the time the maps are so good that I won't even have to bother google translator with the legends, as the cartography is self-explicatory.\n\nI have no idea who holds the copyright for the magnificent collection of map art, but a re-print and perhaps translated into English would most likely be a guaranteed success.\n\nI got mine at a flee-market in the Czech-German borderlands in the early 1990ies. It is one of my biggest treasures ever.\n\nBest regards,\n\nPhil",

Published in 2 volumes, The atlas published in 1965, and the name list published in 1966, this might be one of the most complex post WW2 atlases produced in Europe. The 210 000 names in the separately published in 256 pages, name register prove the amount of data present in the atlas is enormous. Bound in red covers with title in gilt on front cover and spine. The atlas is in 376 pages, in red covers and paper colored dust covers with map of the world and title on front sheet and spine. Atlas divided into two main sections, first part includes world geographical, political, physical and statistical maps, and the second part depicting military historical and the geographical anatomy of the most important battles of history as well as showing battle formations and war strategies from many thousand years B.C. until the Cuban revolution in 1959. Atlas includes color maps, descriptive text, index to and 2 sheets of legends, with separate loose sheets of legend and Supplement to the Map of Asia- Language Division of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic p. 161. Atlas provides a rich assortment of thematic as well as hundreds of physical and political maps,depicting in full detail the topography, coastlines, islands. water system, administrative divisions, roads, railroads, subways, agriculture, industry, energy, population and economic development, Relief shown by gradient tints, shadings, contours and spot heights.

Around 300 people from Czechoslovakian Ministry of Defense, Charles University in Prague and Czech Academy of Science participated in making of this atlas, including Jane Klim, Editor in-Chief, Josef Paxa, Deputy of the editorial board, Bohuslav Simak, Editor of the Geographical section, Karel Blazek, Military historical section, and Josef Vlastnk, technical editor.

There is evidence for contact with Roman Britain as an amphora was discovered at the settlement on the South Barrule; it is hypothesised this may have been trade goods or plunder.",

When the Romans landed on the beach, they got attacked by the women so they fought back. The women retreated to other shamans, and it was something to be doing with a ritual sacrifice. When the Romans found out it was a sacrifice for the enemies Gods and they were the ones that helped it happen, they retreated (because the Romans believed every God from every culture was real) thinking they allowed the shamans to receive help from their Gods and the Romans Gods would think poorly of them and not help them.\n\nEdit: People have mentioned druids so I\u2019m guessing they are called druids not shamans, sorry.",

Purple dye was very expensive to produce back in the day. The process required tons of pain-staking work gathering and extracting dye from a marine species of snail.Tens of thousands of these snails were necessary to create one purple toga. Also, It didn't help that the extraction was very smelly and toxic. This is reason behind the lack of purple in flags and purple being the prefered outfit color of Roman emperors. Perhaps, subconsciously, we see purple and gold as 'nice' a color combination because of the lengths needed to make and wear them. \n\n(I'm quite proud of this little paragraph for some reason) \ud83d\ude05",

Most of the black sea coastline is pretty rainy all the time, esp. the east, tho they are between mountain ranges and the sea so it's way warmer. The touristy regions of Aegean and Mediterranean coasts are again downhill from huge mountain ranges, so they are very hot and extremely humid. Marmara sea region, where Istanbul is, is hilly, but overall way lower than the rest of the country.\n\nIf you want to enjoy the sights of the plains, the steppes and the mountains, take the intercity trains.

Of course, Rome wanted it too, and conquering it back was something Rome struggled doing for centuries. They even won the First Punic War against Carthage before they reconquered that valley, and even though the Carthaginians cost Rome far more casualties than the Gauls ever did, the \"vicious Gauls\" were an imprint in the Roman cultural and historic mythos, and scarier to most ordinary Romans than the Carthaginians ever were up to that point, at least until Hannibal showed up in the Second Punic War.",

Even if you win, it'll cost you more in the long run. \n\nThe Roman military was mostly infantry based, which was *excellent* in mountainous/hilly terrain, but at a severe disadvantage to cavalry on the open plains. If you look at the Roman Empire's borders, you'll mostly notice they're situated on one of the following:\n\n* Coast (most of northern and western Europe, Iberia, and the entire Mediterranean basin)\n* Mountains (Anatolia/Turkey, Middle East, Balkans, Alps, north-western Africa)\n* Desert (northeastern Africa and the Arabian peninsula)\n\nAny of the above is an effective barrier to the tactical mobility as well as logistical movement and supply of large cavalry-based armies, the bane of the Roman army throughout its existence and the reason for some of its most spectacular defeats, from Cannae to Carrhae. \n\nBeyond tactical considerations, swaths of rough terrain also provide a natural geographic limitation to population density in general. On such borders, the Romans were less likely to have a lot of the enemy population living close to the border to begin with, meaning a thinly-stretched garrison could defend a large section of the border as far as local border skirmishes went, while also having more time to organize a response to any large invasions, before they could breach the defensive perimeter.\n\nWhenever the Romans had a stretch of border which *didn't* meet at least one of the above criteria, they had a constant source of trouble which they couldn't permanently solve, and any conquest just pushed the boundary a bit further without actually removing the threat, only over-stretching their supply lines in the process. In the East, almost all of those involved defeats to cavalry and especially cavalry archers, hence the eventual abandonment of most of Mesopotamia east of Anatolia and the Levant. The other place which had flat, poorly defensible land borders coupled with strong enemies were stretches of Dacia and Germania, which unsurprisingly are the locations from where Rome was eventually invaded and overrun by the Huns and Goths respectively. But unlike Mesopotamia, Rome couldn't withdraw from these borders without compromising the defensive line and territorial integrity of the entire Empire, so they had no choice to but to stay.\n\nThe only notable exception to this rule I can think of is Britannia, where, contrary to the usual style of the Romans, they did well in the English plains yet couldn't conquer the Scottish Highlands. But in the grand scheme of things, this exception is rare enough to prove the rule, and was likely driven by economic and logistical factors (too far-off and not worth the trouble) rather than military considerations.\n\nP.S. The threat of over-extending oneself into indefensible terrain and unsustainable supply lines, as well as destroying enemies which otherwise would've acted as buffer states against *other* enemies, is not unique to Rome, and is a cautionary tale to any would-be empire. For example, that's exactly what brought down the Assyrian Empire circa 600 BC, which had been one of the strongest and most ruthless empires in the Ancient World.",

But not really, beyond the tiny Graham Island off of Sicily, which would be too small to appear on the map. \n* The exact paths of the rivers would be a bit different, but the general topology would be similar enough that it's not a problem.\n* If the Romans had gone to the Baltic Sea then Strand might have needed to be checked.",

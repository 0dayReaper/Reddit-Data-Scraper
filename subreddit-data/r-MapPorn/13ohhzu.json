When the attack started, Hitler was asleep and nobody dared to wake him up, so the German tanks couldn't be used in the crucial first hours of the landing. Rommel didn't have authority to use the tanks in his own divisions without Hitler's approval.\n\nHitler did so much to damage the German war efforts that there's a theory that the Allied high command refused to consider any plans to assassinate him. They feared his eventual replacement, G\u00f6ring, would be a much better strategist.",

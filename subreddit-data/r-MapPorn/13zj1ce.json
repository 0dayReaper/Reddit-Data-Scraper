The one above is rather rare as 00-XX-00 was used between 1973 and 1978 but was depleted right at the moment that dark blue (the color that can still be seen in Indonesia) was replaced with our signature black-on-yellow. From that time we used XX-00-XX and the like (XX-XX-00/00-XX-XX) as they deplete slower, however, we now have strung up ourselves so much in imposed limitations (a lot of letters and combinations being unused for whatever reason) that this one, and any with three letters in the middle and three numbers on the side (at least one left and one on the right, the two series laster for merely a decade) already got depleted too. And I believe the three numbers in the middle+three letters on the side (at least one on the left and one on the right) is depleting rapidly too.",

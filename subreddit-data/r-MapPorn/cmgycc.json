Australia would have to hold a constitutional referendum beforehand to prevent it.",

The final draft passed in the British Parliament and was signed off by Queen Victoria in July 1900. It was after these amendments were made that WA signed on. New Zealand hasn't.\n\nPersonally, I prefer to think that Australia is in fact one of the oldest countries in the world; just that it's people didn't know or much care that the rest of the world was out there. It was conquered by the British and its descendents for a century or two, but is slowly finding its way to a balance of old and new. It is going to take us a few more generations to get there I think. But, what's 300 years in 60,000?",

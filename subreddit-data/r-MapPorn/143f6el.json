If you want to look at provincial subdivisions, hilariously the best map I could find is [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Assyrian_Empire#/media/File:Territorial_organization_of_the_Assyrian_Empire_in_times_of_Ashurbanipal.svg) one which looks like it was drawn by a child. There is actually a book containing detailed maps of Assyrian geography (mountain names, kingdom names etc) but I'm no historian and I ain't paying for that, also it's only in German\n2. Georeference this map to satellite imagery in ArcGIS by matching coastlines\n3. Draw an outline around this map to create a polygon whose borders match the empire\n4. Use this polygon to clip a world elevation DEM file \n5. Give that file a cool color gradient (the blue/gold color scheme was inspired by the Ishtar Gate of Babylon)\n6. Follow [this youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9CH-cg8scc&amp;t=455s&amp;ab_channel=4DResearchLab) that allows you to import georeferenced rasters into Blender using the BlenderGIS plugin. Mess around with lighting settings until it looks just right. Export as very high resolution png\n7. In GIS, plot the location of cities. Add a online database of the world's largest rivers\n8. Add render png back into ArcGIS, make sure alignment is correct. Export to Inkscape\n9. In inkscape, add text &amp; export as high resolution png",

That area has been conquered so many times, it\u2019s insane to think there\u2019s millions of history that\u2019s straight up missing due to conquered destruction. One of the coolest places on the planet. Kind of sad what\u2019s happening to it now.",

I was in the Basque Region 4 years ago and you see [ikurri\u00f1as](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikurrina) everywhere so I find it odd that there is low attachment to the region. The French Basque region is located in the region of [Nouvelle-Aquitaine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouvelle-Aquitaine) which also has low region and country attachment, but that could be due to people either feeling Basque, [Occitan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occitania), French, or some other regional identity",

If it's someone from the US or another farther away country I'd say I'm Italian, but if it's with other Italians or people more familiar with the different regions I'd say I'm from FVG/Gorizia province.\n\nIn general the order for me would be FVG, my town, and then Italian",

And despite the fact that the Bavarians label everyone north of the river Main as \"Prussians\" or \"Northern Germans\", that's too much of a generalisation, not more than a stereotype. The \"real\" north consists more or less of the coastal regions, and some of them (as can be seen on the map) habe a strong identity of their own, but the rest is very different, both from the North and the South and from each other. A Rhinelanders, Saxons, Hessians etc. are not much less different from each other than from Bavarians, Swabians, etc. And speaking as a Saxon, calling us Prussians is an offense.

It\u2019d just be too ridiculous to do so.\n\nJust because we\u2019re born and live on the same continent (which is arguably just a subcontinent of the greater Eurasian landmass) doesn\u2019t mean I have much of anything in common with, say, a Finn. Our native languages aren\u2019t even in the same tree, we live in considerably different climates, our cultures evolved under different circumstances and may uphold different sets of values. Other than the fact that we\u2019re both from a landmass west of the Urals, that\u2019s where the similarities end.\n\nIf some day my country does end up joining the EU (which I\u2019m not opposed to at all), none of the aforementioned differences will change. So why should I identify with an area stretching from Iceland to the Caspian Sea?",

And more with my country than the rest of Scandinavia, Scandinavia before the rest of Europe ect. But I can be danish, Scandinavian and European all at the same time. I definitely identify more with a European than someone from the Americas or Asia.\nIf the Americans can build an identity across 300+ million people and a massive landmass then so can Europe (and so does Europe need to do, to have a strong union that can defend itself from other superpower\u2019s influence)",

It's a mish-mash of Arabic dialects spoken by Jews from Arabic countries but when they were ethnically cleansed and escaped to Israel they stopped speaking Arabic and changed to Hebrew (change was pretty fast since both are Semetic languages).\n\nAnd Israelis/Jews learning Arabic just learn the Levantine/Palestinian dialect (Palestinian dialect has many slang words in Hebrew, and Hebrew has many slang words in Arabic)\n\nThere were times in the middle ages when Judeo-Arabic had more speakers than Yiddish.",

A speaker of \"pure\" Moroccan Arabic and a speaker of \"pure\" Gulf Arabic cannot really understand each other. In practice most know also at least some standard modern Arabic (as this is what it's used in schools) and they can adjust in order to understand each other. At the same time some \"dialects\" like the Egyptian ones are also a bit more well known due to influence they have in media (music, movies).",

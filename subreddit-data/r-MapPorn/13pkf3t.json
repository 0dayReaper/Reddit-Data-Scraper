And so closer to the equator you get the more accurate the size is.\n\nOf course mexico is still smaller than the US but it's not small.\n\nKeep in mind mexico city is one of the most populace cities in the world.\n\nBut land mass it's like the 14th largest.

Your logical inconsistency is so bizarre that you don't even have a logical fallacy, since no logic was made at all. You seem to label me as \"the enemy\" \"the other\" \"imbecile Russian advocate\" which is nothing close to the fraction of reality but a phantomized notions that exist nowhere but inside few cubic centimetres of your pink brain. You have confined yourself to the space now your entrapped.   My whole argument was that Crimea has Russian historical and enthnical background and hence more reasonable to be held by Russians in the sake of enthnic autonomy. You are a shmuck. An Incapacitated of ideology, the rind licker. I can enumerate your faultiness all day. Population of your kind is generally the vivid representation of degeneration of the very civilization. When mankind itself were to finally perish some day on its sepulcher your name will be on it.",

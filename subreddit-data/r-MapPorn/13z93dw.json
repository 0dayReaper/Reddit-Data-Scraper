But even if we expand to the so-called 12 (I\u2019d say 11) \u2018world religions\u2019, the larger, traditional, established, scriptured ones, *all* come from Asia. Being:\n\nFrom the Levant, Abrahamic: Judaism, Christianity, Islam\n\nFrom India: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism\n\nIf we generalise to include Indo-Iranians as well as geographic India we can add: Zoroastrianism\n\nFrom China: Confucianism, Taoism\n\nJapan: Shinto\n\nSome people add Baha\u2019i, another Persian religion, so still Asia. But it\u2019s not as old as the rest, and it\u2019s a bit difficult to justify including it but not several other \u2018new religions\u2019 from Brazil, the U.S., Vietnam, etc. \n\nEven then, it\u2019s telling what qualifies a religion to be on that list, and it\u2019s quite subjective and iffy:\n\nOther older religions of a similar category include Mandaeism (in Iraq), Samaritanism (in Israel) but these are very small. Arguably Druze, but about half of the Druze claim it is a branch of Islam, and then various Kurdish religions like Yazidism, but these are far less formalised despite recent modern sects doing so. \n\nMany other larger religions that are either quite young (younger than Sikhism, so from the \u2018modern\u2019 period, usually since the 1800s), or claim to be true forms of established religions (like Mormons claiming Christianity).\n\nThen you have all the traditional folk religions, often less formalised, from Africa, SE Asia, Chinese folk religion, Korea\u2019s analogue of Shinto, New World religions\u2026 Most don\u2019t quite have the official status or vast old literature that Hinduism and Shinto have, and Chinese and Korean folk religion are in many ways seen as absorbed into others.",

To be honest, they\u2019re quite different categories and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to say that Hinduism is a collection of many religions in the same way that the \u2018Abrahamic religions\u2019 are, since Abrahamic religions tend to be very definitive about being right where others are wrong, those cordoning themselves off from each other, while Hindu sects mostly don\u2019t do that at all. \n\nRather, there\u2019s \u2018religion\u2019, and the notion of \u2018a religion\u2019, specifically demarcated, tends to make more sense in an Abrahamic context, and maybe Zoroastrian too. \n\nInstead, a bit like pre-Christian Europe, Hinduism is a religious world or umbrella for many different sects that seem very different but are somewhat compatible. But it\u2019s a bit more nuanced than that, as Buddhism and Jainism were seen as fundamentally different (nastika) from early on, and beyond not recognising the Vedas the extent to which this is true is itself a whole thorny question, as \u2018astika\u2019 Hindu schools of thought are very diverse. There are a few key precepts common to them (though *not* the ones Westerners might expect, like which gods to worship) and a few points of difference from Jainism and Buddhism even today. \n\nSimilar could be said of China, with Chinese folk religion and mythology taking the role of folk Hinduism and Hindu mythology, and Taoism and Confucianism taking the role of different Hindu philosophical schools. But China also has its own tradition of categorisation, not imposed by foreigners, and its history of more state unity and enforced belief systems makes it different again\u2026",

(The north is mostly Muslim, the south is mostly Christian.)\n\nBut Muslim birthrates in Nigeria are higher than Christian birthrates, so even if it's close to 50/50 now, Muslims will eventually be more numerous. So I coloured it green to future-proof my map.",

I do not make any effort to show that Russia has Buddhist-majority areas (including the only Buddhist-majority polity in Europe), or that India has the world's third-largest Muslim population, even though I find those facts quite interesting.\n\nI hope the reader understands that countries are not homogenous.",

In other words, they follow Mahayana Buddhist doctrines while worshipping Shinto deities, with Japonization of Buddhist practices here and there. \n\nBuddhist nations seldom practice Buddhism alone but usually mix it with local or localized deities. The Theravada Buddhist nations (Singhalese, Thai, Burmese, Khmer, and Laotian) mix their Buddhism along with Hinduist deities; Mahayana nations (Chinese, and Korean until present day) adopt Buddhism along with indigenous pantheism (such as ancestral worship and heroic worship) and Taoism; Japanese Shinbutsu Shugo Buddhism is mentioned as above; and Vajrayana Buddhist nations (namely Tibetans, Mongolian, and Manchurians) mixes Buddhism with Tibetan Bon Religion, and/or their own shamanistic pantheism.",

Moat Japanese people have shinto weddings and Buddhist funerals, as shinto deals with life, renewal, cleansing and the 'new', blessing things in the realm of the living, there is no dogma per se. Buddhism deals more with death and such things are more associated with it in Japan. So most people will go to a shinto shrine say, on new years, weddings, getting a new car blessed, etc. But will have buddhist funerals.\n\nSource: I lived and worked at a shinto shrine for over a year as an assistant to the priest.",

My understanding is that the idea of world religions or the big five was more of an educational technique than a sophisticated understanding of religion, and it was also used mainly by scholars comparing religions rather than experts in particular religious traditions. Still, proponents of using this model are fitting all religions into a Protestant-inspired system of denominations and hierarchies that doesn\u2019t apply to most religions.",

That is, Jews have an *immensely* disproportionate representation in (North American) media compared to their actual population. There are approximately 16 million Jews in the world. That's it. There are cities larger than that (albeit, those are among the largest cities in the world and they number in the single digits, but still). \n\nOf those 16 million, just over 7.1 million live in a single country, Israel. Another 7.6 million live in the US. Just 2 countries contain 14.7/16 million global Jews, with the remaining 1.3 being scattered around the world (330,000 live in Canada, 370,000 live in the UK, 440,000 in France, only 5 others have more than 100,000). \n\nComparatively, there are 26 million Sikhs. \"Chinese traditional religion\" counts 394 million,  Shinto is actually kind of weird because, depending on your definition of \"being in a religion,\" it is either 3 million people or like 80% of Japan. Either way, point being, aside from its diasporic nature, Judaism is very very far from being a major religion. It is the faith of a single ethnic group that lives primarily in just two countries but has smaller populations around the (mostly Western) world.",

Overall. Europe had nearly 9 million Jews.  There were only about 1 million Jews in the US.   \n\nCompared to 1900, India today has nearly a quarter as many Jews.  The Jewish population of Europe today is literally less than half of what it was in 1970.  The Jewish population of Tunisia was over 100k in 1948, but less than a thousand today.\n\nI don't disagree that calling Judaism a major world religion is being generous, and mostly comes out of eurocentrism.  However, it's worth pointing out on the subject of media representation that the diaspora used to be significantly more widespread. \n\nThere's a lot of people who might not have grown up near many Jews, but grew up near a  synagogue built centuries ago that's now a museum.",

In the States, Protestants have many of the most progressive denominations that have been LBGT affirming for years or even decades in some instances. I\u2019m thinking of the UCC, PCUSA Presbyterians, UMC Methodists, many Lutherans (the appropriate acronym aludes me), and others.\n\nWhat most people think of as Evangelicals has more to do with their politics than their doctrine. Because within that camp are both non-Protestants such as Pentecostals and Non-Denoms plus the more conservative Protestants such as Baptists and those from the right wing of the already mentioned Protestant traditions. \n\nIn America, an evangelical used to mean those who were attempting a middle ground between the fundamentalists and the liberals at the beginning of the 20th century. Evangelicals wanted to hold to orthodoxy, but also didn\u2019t want to abandon the culture and academics altogether. The fundamentalists over the course of the 20th century however either withered away like the IFB or for the most part just came into Evangelicalism and pulled them further toward their camp. If you go back to the 1970s then you would find that pro-life was by no means a given stance among self proclaimed evangelicals.",

Even inside the EU there are countries that don't allow it (although that isn't that big of a shock, as Poland, hungary and basically all of eastern Europe exist).\n\nEdit: [this map](https://ilga.org/sites/default/files/downloads/ENG_ILGA_World_map_sexual_orientation_laws_dec2020.png) is even more detailed.\nI find it kind of funny how gay people can't marry in Bolivia, Nepal, Fiji and Kosovo, but they are constitutionally protected against discrimination.\n\nEdit 2: take this map with a grain of salt, as apparently the US, India, Ireland and Nepal are all wrong.",

There was recently a petition in Indian supreme court to allow same sex marriage and court actually pushed back with the advice that since constitution does not prohibit the case should be filed if such a marriage is actually not permitted by any officials.",

Keep in mind the current party in power are mostly descendants of Taiwanese people who arrived on the island anywhere between 1600 to 1945 and view themselves as Taiwanese only rather than both Chinese and Taiwanese.\n\nThis is in contrast to the KMT which is the China-friendly party of Taiwan. They fled to Taiwan in the mid 1900s after losing the Chinese Civil War and want eventual reunification. I think if given the opportunity, the KMT would jump at the chance to install their own government in Beijing.",

After WW2, the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) fought the ROC, who eventually retreated to Taiwan, moving the capital to Taipei. Since Taiwan is a difficult to invade island, active hostilities came to a standstill, but no peace treaty or armistice was ever signed between the ROC and the CCP.\n\nTherefore, the official position of both the ROC and the CCP is that \"they\" own both the mainland and Taiwan. This is also what the CCP is proclaiming, all of China is one big country, Taiwan just happens to be controlled by a government in Exile that doesn't respect the real leader of China, the CCP.\n\nWhat this ignores is that many Taiwanese would be okay with just being an independent nation which does not lay any claim to the mainland. Note that there is some difference in opinion about this within Taiwan, some Taiwanese want independence, others want reunification in some way (peaceful or not, CCP-led, ROC-led, ...), based on my understanding, wanting reunification or independence is a major theme in Taiwanese politics. All that said, the CCP prefers the current status quo and have repeatedly stated that a Taiwanese declaration of independence would cause the CCP to invade. To prevent this, the official position of Taiwan is still that they are the legitimate ruler of all of China.\n\nNote that you should take all of this with a grain of salt. This is all just based on my fairly limited knowledge of the entire situation. Look up the Chinese civil war if you want more information.",

The Chinese nationalists, the KMT, established the ROC in 1911. Most of Taiwan felt that they were separate from the Chinese revolution and at the time felt disconnected to the Chinese revolution and subsequent Chinese Civil War. \n\nIt doesn't help that when they first received Taiwan the ROC essentially treated it like a colony and exploited the people and resources. When the ROC fled to Taiwan they had an authoritative rule and a 38-year long martial law (second longest in world history). Taiwan eventually democratized and KMT influence in Taiwan has been waning (the KMT when they fled to Taiwan at most made up 25% of Taiwan's population). \n\nThe KMT and their descendants lean towards eventual reunification, but for most of the Taiwanese that experienced Japanese colonial rule and their descendants, they would prefer independence, especially if there's no threat of Chinese invasion.",

It wasn\u2019t just about him, it was about every single person with a stake in the series. Which is a lot of people. And of course if he says Taiwan\u2019s a country and \u201cdenounces\u201d China he will not be able to take part in anything that\u2019s directly involved in the future. It\u2019s a lose lose situation with pretty massive consequences for either a lot of people or just him, and he said the words he needed to say. Not like I haven\u2019t lost some respect for him but it\u2019s not the end of the world in my opinion.",

So, pretty much anyone who wanted to obtain a civil marriage outside of religious marriage had to leave the country. But in recent years, I think the Israeli courts have allowed a limited number of civil marriages to be performed domestically for people who can prove they don't fall under any religious authority. If a same-sex couple qualified, they might be able to obtain a civil marriage license in the country (I'm not sure).\n\nThe problem is, all the religious groups authorized to perform marriages refuse to recognize same-sex marriage. They also generally refuse to recognize interfaith marriages. The vast majority of Israelis support same-sex marriage rights. But the marriage system is antiquated.",

The border between the North American tectonic plate and the Eurasian plate for example runs through the middle of East Siberia, not through the Aleutian Islands like you'd maybe expect from looking at a map.\n\nIf you go by tectonic plates OTOH you get new oddities like [Zealandia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zealandia), which is increasingly recognized by geologists as a continent because it's made up of continental crust and has almost the size of Australia, even though the vast majority of it is covered by ocean.\n\nIf you go back in time, about 400 million years ago it was actually Europe and North America that were attached to each other, not Europe and Asia, forming Euramerica (also called Laurussia). Over the following 200 million years the Pangaea supercontinent was formed, which proceeded to progressively break up about 175 million years ago into the continents that we know today.\n\nIn the end \"continent\" just isn't a very strictly defined term but rather a relatively loose concept that depends a lot on the context. Geologically Europe and Asia are one continent, politically, culturally and historically not so much.",

But again, due to the religious nature of Israel's marriage laws, this is the case for most heterosexual marriages, as well, since many do not want to be wed through religious circumstances.\n\nSomething of note is Israel's recognition of unregistered cohabitation between same sex couples, performed within Israel, giving same sex couples the same benefits of marriage in the form of civil union, making Israel effectively the first Asian country to recognize same-sex unions in any capacity arrangers within its borders, as well (since 1994 IIRC).\n\nBut Taiwan is the first to recognize same sex marriage arranged within it's boundaries (I assume there are no asterisks).",

Currently, our US marriage isn\u2019t recognized in Japan. I can\u2019t wait for it to be, so I don\u2019t have to worry about us getting separated while we\u2019re in Japan (like not being able to visit each other in the hospital or me not being able to enter Japan during quarantine, etc.).",

However, specifically people that have paternal surnames of Prussian origin tend to get curious and dig deep enough. (famous example being Tolkien - though JRR Tolkien was made aware late in his life he ultimately didn't seem to care - thankfully the same can not be said about his descendents thereafter)  \nMost modern Prussians live in Lithuania as Baltic culture prevailed there and Prussian is ultimately much easier to learn for speakers of Baltic languages. There is a new Kriwwi (high priest) of Romowe as well - a branch of Baltic paganism that continued in Lithuania.  \nThere are more Baltic languages where revival/preservation efforts are made but it's mostly up to volunteers to do so.",

If to generalise more widely as \"Baltic-Prussian\" it becomes more ambiguous. Understandably a pure and 100% authentic revival is impossible, as such nawa - new. Using the legacy of the past we try to build a new legacy into the future which is as authentic of a continuation as sources allow - new elements and change being part of that continuation. As such feeding a \"modern nationalistic sentiment\" has little to do with rewriting history - all that is in the past has happened and all we can do is interpret historical accounts as accurately as possible.  \nI'm not entirely sure why you seem so hung up on an extinction to be the end of a given culture.

Farul has always been Constanta's team and has the overwhelming support of the city. Hagi's Viitorul was a completely new team, and although they were good they never had significant support. His intention wasn't to necessarily take over Constanta's football scene, but to rather start a youth academy in the city. Merging the two clubs results in all the fan support of Farul and the quality of Viitorul so it's a win win really for them.",

Your question should be: \"Why do Swansea City, Cardiff City, Newport County, Wrexham and Merthyr Tydfil all play in the English pyramid and not the Welsh one?\"\n\nAnswer: They were playing in English leagues long before the Welsh football pyramid was established. Because Wales is a small country with a small population, some of its top clubs represent villages, with attendances that are a small fraction of the gates in the EFL or even some top tier non-league grounds. The 'big five' will therefore not be joining the Cymru Premier, as it would result in a sharp drop in gate receipts.\n\nIt's also not unheard of for a club to play in another country's league. Europe has several examples; the current Welsh champions are based in Oswestry a few miles over the English border, but Welsh culture has always been part of Oswestry's make-up.",

Countries like Malta , Luxembourg , Andorra , Montenegro , Kosovo ( and territories like Faroe , Northern Ireland and Wales ) just have their own functioning leagues , with football clubs playing each other in a round-robin format just like in every other league.\n\nThe only micronation that does it differently is Lichtenstein where the teams play in a cup format.",

Their clubs actually play in the Swiss leagues with the best Liechtensteiner team (Vaduz) even playing in the Swiss top tier in recent years\n\nEven the UEFA microstates like San Marino, Gibraltar and Andorra have national leagues.\n\nHistorically Wales was in a similar situation to Liechtenstein. No national league and all their main clubs played in the English system. They founded their league in the 90s but all of the biggest Welsh teams still play in England",

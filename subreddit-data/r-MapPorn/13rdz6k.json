If you adjust HDI by taking inequalities into account, it loses more than 30% of its HDI.\n\nThe north has rich ore deposits so it looks like the HDI is higher, but that's just on average. In reality there are fewer people (because it's a desert), and among those few people, a small minority are very rich. Which makes the average HDI higher, if you don't take inequalities into account.\n\nIt is true for other countries on the map, such as Gambia or Lesotho.",

Which is for instance why Equatorial Guinea has such a low HDI even though the state is oil rich. So for HDI to be high in northern Mauritania, the average person needs to have a decent standard of living there, which is the question why.\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/African_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita_in_2017.png\n\nSome nations do a lot with very little, while others are still bad in spite of their wealth.\n\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/grapher/exports/hdi-vs-gdp-per-capita.svg",

There is no boost given to IHDI scores for having high equality. The only adjustment is that a country's HDI is reduced by the proportion of inequality present.",

We can consider that Al Shabaab reduced HDI even in regions of Somalia not under their control, but one of the reasons why Al Shabaab is so powerful is because of how Somalia is politically and socially structured. It's similar to the situation in the Sahel - yes, jihadists bring the HDI down, but we're looking at very tribal/clanic and warlike societies too.",

East Africa was for example very much interconnected with West Asia.\n\nAnd doesn't the Bantu migration  already disprove the theory that: \"West to East means a more homogenous culture?\"",

It's of course also geography and the enormous landmass itself causing there to be many areas that are very inaccessible.\n\nHowever it's definitely the case that there were many nomadic societies / groups that preyed on sedentary groups for the slave trade, and this can be linked to climate to an extent.\n\nAnd sorry, I don't really follow what you mean with the Bantu expansion disproving anything?

Most of the colonial infrastructure was focused on resource extraction, so you have a situation where most of the roads and railways connect from resources in the interior to ports, rather than connecting cities with each other. In most countries in the world, their biggest trade partners are their neighbors, but in Africa, the biggest trade partners tend to be former colonial countries. I remember hearing a quote about Nigeria: more schools and hospitals were built in the first 10 years of independence than during decades of being \u201ccivilized\u201d by the British as a colony.\n\nAlso, much of Africa has had terrible, terrible leadership. Some of it was by design: France kept in place puppet rulers friendly to their interests, and launched numerous military interventions to install dictatorships into power. Gabon for example had a dictatorship installed by France that lasted for decades, and sold cheap uranium to France to power their nuclear industry. Most of Francophone Africa is also shackled to the African Franc, maintained by France\u2019s central bank, which also dictates the monetary policy and holds about 75% of the currency reserves for African countries involved. The central bank makes a profit from loaning these other countries\u2019 reserves back out to them with interest, and the African Franc\u2019s monetary policy tends to be guided by French interests, not African ones.",

Thus, due to this, and also followed by the opening of China to Capitalism by Deng Xiaoping by the late 20th Century, means that Indo-Pacific will remain the manufacturing powerhouse of the world for the rest of the Century. \n\nAnd so, the countries that were under Communist or military dictatorships had an easy time opening up (e.g. China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand) and attract MNCs from the 4 Tigers and then from China. \n\nIt's much cheaper for businesses to move to countries w established infrastructure. The 1st business will pay a lot, and the 2nd will pay less than the 1st, and the 3rd will pay less than the 2nd, and so on. And moving away from China to SE Asia is cheaper and more practical than moving from China to Africa. \n\nIn contrast, sub-Saharan African history was also riddled with pro-autarky right-wing and left-wing dictatorships, and now that they are opening up to Globalism, they lack the proximity to Asia.",

God I laugh whenever I see a westerner say something as profoundly ignorant as this. \n\nWhat do you think we are, some kind of different species or something?\n\n\n&gt;Personal wealth in the Western world and personal wealth in third countries or among countries that have had their own culture since centuries, are widely different. I lived in one of these countries, give me 1 dollar and I have a meal for the day. \n\n\n&gt;The local production thrives enough to support the population, and it equals less exportations, also for many other reasons. Which equals to less wealth on an international level, and thus, the red marker everywhere.\n\nIf you actually lived amongst locals and not some expat enclave from which you visit \u201cwe native\u201d you\u2019d realize this is very much not the case. \n\nWealth is wealth please. Weather it\u2019s in hectares of land, herd of cattle, number of houses, size of family or amount of zeroes in your bank account it is the same freaking thing. And we appreciate wealth the same everyone from East Asians to middle easterners do. We want it for ourselves , we want it for our children. \n\n&gt;But otherwise people are not starving in streets or something, unless there is wars going on. \n\nThis is perhaps the most true thing you\u2019ve said. Starvation is actually a VERY rare thing in the modders world anywhere outside of war zones. \n\n\n&gt;It seems like Africans aren\u2019t quite interested into the massive, wasteful consumerism that is currently blowing up the planet, and the lifestyle of their ancestors is really put above everything, the neocolonialism and imperialism helping into depicting many Western fantasies as inherently evil or manipulative. \n\nAnd this is perhaps the most untrue thing you\u2019ve said. Like wow \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. I don\u2019t even know where to begin with such BS.\n\nDo you think we see Iphones, laptops, video games, flights to interesting places and we go \u201cEvil western fantasies\u201d ? You think the Okada man on the street having his kids hawking refreshments to local professionals so he can send his kids to school is concerned about his impact on the natural environment. Please get out of here with such Bs. \n\nPOVERTY is real. \n\nAnd it is fucking crippling. It\u2019s why thousands of our brothers and sisters decide to cross the fuking Mediterranean every day just to die in it. \n\nIt\u2019s why the brightest minds on our continent borrow form everyone they can to be able to go to school in the US and Canada never to return. \n\nIt\u2019s why some of our youth(not all) go on to defraud fault or westerners and spend the money to manifest themselves on a station superior to their peers. \n\nHell it\u2019s why our bastard leaders would take in IMF loans, use it to buy luxury villas in California or Apartments in London, open Swiss banal accounts and never pay off those debts. \n\nDon\u2019t bullshit yourself, and don\u2019t bullshit the casual viewer here who\u2019s not African cause you sure as hell aren\u2019t bulshitting us. We don\u2019t want to be fucking poor. We consumes just as much as the Chinese, Arabs, Europeans and anyone else would if we had the resources to. However we straight up are just limited in economic opportunities and resources to live the kind of lifestyles that we want. Same with everyone else on the planet including you westerners. Why ? Cause we\u2019re freaking humans just like you all not some \u201cunique beauty spoilt by western fantasies\u201d\n\n\n&gt;All in all, I think these maps are going to be red until the end of time,\n\nBy God we fuking hope not\ud83d\ude46\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. Hell this is why we don\u2019t like you environmentalist westerners\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. Cause you say shit like this. You literally think this is ideal as it satisfies some dispicable fantasy you all have about how we somehow enjoy high child mortality, poor maternal outcomes, high unemployment, workplace violence, gender violence and shit like this. About how not being able to buy toys for our children is somehow something we choose. About how not being able to afford to live our towns, not to talk of our countries to see the rest of the world is simply cause we\u2019re concerned with the impact of air travel on the environment. \n\nPlease. Stop presuming to speak for Africans. Please just don\u2019t. It comes of as more insulting than the idiots who claim it\u2019s cause fight too much. Atleast they recognize we actually want to solve the endemic poverty on the continent and not pretend this state of being is somehow noble. \n\nPlease we do not wish to be in the red till the end of time. We are not freaking aliens. We are humans just like you lot.",

This take is incredibly offensive to almost a billion people. Africa is made of up 52 countries that are very different in culture, economy, and security. It is anything but unlivable. It is beautiful, full of rich culture AND has a thriving  middle class across the continent. Are some places on the continent unsafe or underdeveloped? Sure. But it\u2019s impossible to walk around Cape Town or Rabat and find it unlivable. \n\nSource: I LIVED IN AN AFRICAN COUNTRY FOR SEVERAL YEARS",

South Africa is a good and bad example since it's very unequal but generally has a higher standard than many countries in Africa.

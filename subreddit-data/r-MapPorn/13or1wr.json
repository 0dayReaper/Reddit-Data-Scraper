But it's rare enough to hear one, that a person on the street gets shocked by hearing one and would give the middle finger to the honker. Unsolicited honks are bad, and even worse was when I was shielding my left ear from a loud truck, but then he sounded the horn on an empty street *because* I shielded my left ear. Sorry but yes of course then you deserve a middle finger.\n\nAlso, you'll seldomly hear a train horn. They are only tested once a day in rural terrain, and besides that are only used in case of emergency. This is vastly unlike some countries where they honk for every single level crossing.",

It's literally a video of driving in Beijing and Shanghai. If it truly was so noisy you should hear the constant honking in these \"driving in city\" videos, but you barely hear any honking at all.\n\nNah honking is *way* worse in India. Look up any video of driving in India. Right at the start there's honking already.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Af0SUwah1bQ\n\nWatch any tourist vlogger going to India, the amount of honking you hear is insane. There's no silence. ASEAN is also worse with honking than China, except Singapore, but not as bad as India or South Asia in general.",

Higher rates of prescription of anti depressants doesn't necessarily mean worse quality of life.  \n   \nThis could mean higher rates of depression, doctors more eager to prescribe medication, patients more willing to accept medication, etc. \n   \n  It's impossible to say with the data given. And kind of a waste, because again, this data is 13 years old.",

You\u2019ll see one for every 20 churches\u2026 oh, forgot how people measure distance outside of this state; one every 30-ish minutes of travel.\n\nSurprisingly a lot of these are actually good places to be treated as well, though an important minority still treat anxiety/ocd/depression as something shameful or dangerous to the community and lock you away like a child in the suicide watch of a hospital (I assume other places have those, too?).\n\nI bring this up because SSRI\u2019s are still very popular in treating that whole mess of mental stuff. They are sometimes used for things outside of being prescribed as an anti-depressant, which is important to note. Finally, we have a pretty large medical infrastructure/\u201cindustry\u201d movement going on down here which helps contribute to those numbers in Utah.",

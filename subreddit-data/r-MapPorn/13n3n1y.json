It was the students choice if they wanted to sign up for extra work and join one of the courses where you could learn more because there was an extra book in the curriculum, so slightly quicker pace. You had to have a certain GPA to qualify for joining the honors courses. Honors was kinda nice because it filtered out the stoners asking idiotic questions on repeat, but Regular had a nice chill to it (I went back and forth over the years). I wasn\u2019t about to sign up for AP (which would\u2019ve gotten me a college credit), I was already struggling to keep up with homework and those kids were always stressed but they covered a lot more stuff than we did.",

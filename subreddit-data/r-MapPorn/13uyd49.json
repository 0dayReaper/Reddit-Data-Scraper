I know there's a massive dam there, but is that a sufficient explanation on its own? \n\nDid the southern settlements get flooded and no one bothered repopulating the new river banks, or is it that the southward spread of population stopped at the dam for some reason, for example, the reservoir having unstable fluctuating banks?\n\nI don't know the history of the dam, and don't care enough to google. :P",

Your first guess is essentially right, past the high dam to the border the inhabitable parts of the Nile River valley are pretty much all flooded. In exchange Egypt is able to manage how much and when water flows through the rest of their downstream population centers in order to mitigate flooding and increase development potential. The latter worked almost too well as illustrated by this map",

After the dam was built, the land that was a source of livelihood was submerged, so logically, people don't live there unless they have a specific reason to (like working at the dam).",

What you see in the map is it going straight trough a desert, the Sahara, the largest desert on the planet. The Nile gets its water from massive lakes bigger than many countries in the rainy equatorial central/eastern parts of Africa covered in rain-forests, mainly from lake Victoria, which is the second largest fresh water lake on the planet.\n\nEdit: [See that thing in the upper right? That's Egypt. See those massive blue blobs in the center of the continent? That's where the water comes from, mainly lake Victoria. See that orange-ish upper third of Africa? That's the Sahara.](https://www.brgm.fr/sites/default/files/images/2020-08/references-carte-hydrogeologique-afrique-001.jpg)",

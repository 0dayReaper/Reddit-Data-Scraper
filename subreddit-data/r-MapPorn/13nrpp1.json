But yes, it should be \"broc d'eau\".\n\nFor me if it's glass and transparent, it's a \"carafe\" (though actual carafes are more bottle-like and don't always have a handle) or a pichet. If it's made of terracotta and opaque, it's definitely a \"pichet\". \"Broc\" is not a word I use often and I usually picture it as made of plastic or metal. And if it's made of terracotta and has 2 handles and no \"bec verseur\" (sprout?), it's a \"cruche\".\n\nEdit; the possible anwers were:\n\n- un broc\n- un broc d\u2019eau [prononc\u00e9: brodo]\n- un broc d\u2019eau [prononc\u00e9: broKdo]\n- un broc \u00e0 eau\n- une carafe\n- une cruche\n-  un pichet\n- un pot (d\u2019eau)\n- autre (pr\u00e9cisez) :\n\nSee https://francaisdenosregions.com/2018/10/10/vous-dites-pot-deau-cruche-ou-carafe/",

But on the south they say also \u00abpitxer\u00bb, so pichet would be acceptable, too.\n\nAnyway, \u00abbroc\u00bb is just the hole from which the water goes out, not the whole recipient. And \u00abpot d'aigua\u00bb would be just the explanation, not the name.\n\nWe have not word (AFAIK) related to cruche.",

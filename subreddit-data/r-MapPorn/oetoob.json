We were expecting a bobcat or something but it sounded like a woman stuck her head in the car and screamed at the top of her lungs. Scared one of my friends so bad he actually pissed himself, granted we were trashed.\n\nThe only mythical beast I remember anyone talking about is lots of people claim to have seen giant cats in the woods at night.

I googled it but there\u2019s not even as much as a Wikipedia article on her, and every other link is to websites like blogs that are talking about the Huggin Molly\u2019s restaurant in Abbeville.

They were brought over for their knowledge of rice cultivation and were largely left alone, so they\u2019ve retained more of their west African culture than other African Americans in the US. This includes a syncretic religion \u201cHoodoo\u201d (or rootwork, idk the proper term), similar to Santeria/Vodun/Voodoo. Boo hags will suck your breath out of your body but you can prevent them from coming into your house by leaving newspaper or things with lots of holes by your door, because they have to read or count anything they come across. (I think, it\u2019s been a while).\n\nGullah people are pretty unique and have their own language and cuisine, but are dying out. My grandmother was Gullah and a lot of rootwork is illegal to practice and the culture was looked down so a lot of practices aren\u2019t documented. Things like ring shouts, woven baskets, Brer Rabbit/other animals, and blue ceilings are distinctively Gullah. Most people are familiar with Gullah dishes like Shrimp and Grits, Red Rice, and Hoppin\u2019 John.",

Here's the pertinent part with the full story linked below:\n\n&gt;In a dramatic example of frontier justice, Wallace beheaded Vidal then lashed him firmly into a saddle on the back of a wild mustang. Tying the\u00a0[outlaw\u2019s](https://www.legendsofamerica.com/outlaws/)\u00a0hands to the pommel and securing the torso to hold him upright, Big Foot then attached Vidal\u2019s head and sombrero to the saddle with a long strip of rawhide. He then turned the bucking horse loose to wander the\u00a0Texas\u00a0hills with its terrible burden on his back.\n\n&gt;Soon, stories began to abound about the headless rider seen usually in remote country, with its sombreroed head swinging back and forth to the rhythm of horse\u2019s gallop.\n\n&gt;As time went on, more and more cowboys spotted the dark horse with its fearsome cargo, and not knowing what it was they riddled it with bullets. But the horse and its rider rode on and the legend of El Muerto, the headless one, began. Soon, the South Texas brush country became a place to avoid as El Muerto was credited with all kinds of evil and misfortune.\n\n[source](https://www.legendsofamerica.com/tx-elmuerto/)",

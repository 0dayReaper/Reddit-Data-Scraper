            "comment": "Here is my first take on a Japanese system: a very minimalist and abstract schematic representation of the subway and streetcar networks in the municipality of Sapporo, Hokkaido\r  \n\r  \nThe Sapporo municipal subway is a rather conventional underground rubber-tyred railway system and consists of three lines:\r  \n\r  \n\\- the Namboku line \u5357\u5317\u7dda (green): 14.3km/8.89miles, 16 stations, opened in 1971\r  \n\r  \n\\- the T\u014dzai line \u6771\u897f\u7dda (orange): 20.1km/12.5miles, 19 stations, opened in 1976\r  \n\r  \n\\- the T\u014dh\u014d line \u6771\u8c4a\u7dda (blue): 13.6km/8.5miles, 14 stations, opened in 1988\r  \n\r  \nAll lines radiate outward from a central point at \u014cdori (\u5927\u901a) and also serve railway stations, offering connection to JR Hokkaido main line services at Sapporo (\u3055\u3063\u307d\u308d) station for both the Namboku and T\u014dh\u014d lines and at Shin-Sapporo (\u65b0\u3055\u3063\u307d\u308d) on the T\u014dzai line\r  \n\r  \nIn addition to the subway, Sapporo boasts a charming streetcar system -also known as \u2018shiden\u2019 (\u5e02\u96fb) by locals. Sole remnant of a once larger network of streetcars opened in 1909 and electrified later in 1918, the Sapporo Shiden travels along a circular route serving 24 stations all located within the central Ch\u016b\u014d-ku (\u4e2d\u592e\u533a) area and offer multiple connections to the subway\r  \n\r  \nDesign-wise, my intention was to make a visually playful map -almost \"kawaii\" if you will- with the use of soft, gentle colours, while keeping it as compact and schematic but also esthetically coherent as possible\r  \n\r  \nNot going bilingual here and showing only Japanese text was obviously a sweet trick as I was then allowed to use its flexibility to be written either horizontally or vertically to help get that \"compact\" but also definitely Japanese feel I was looking for",

My partner's eyes have even itching whenever we open the windows. She explained the smoke smell and airborne irritants are due to various fires hundreds or thousands of km distant.

One driver (i.e., media) remains ambivalent insofar as its dynamics are volatile, both supporting and undermining decarbonization.\"\n\n\"We conclude that reaching worldwide deep decarbonization by 2050 is currently not plausible, given the observable trajectories of social drivers. The select physical processes of public interest only moderately, if at all, inhibit the plausibility of attaining the Paris Agreement temperature goals, although they can substantially modify the physical boundary conditions for society. Meeting the 1.5\u00b0C Paris Agreement temperature goal is not plausible, but limiting the global temperature rise to well below 2\u00b0C can become plausible if ambition, implementation, and knowledge gaps are closed.\"\n\nhttps://www.fdr.uni-hamburg.de/record/11230/files/cliccs-hamburg-climate-futures-outlook-2023.pdf",

I hope I have made it a bit clearer. \n\nI understand your confusion with use of quotation marks instead of markdown on a Reddit post, but they do the trick here",

The mountains that are 5km from my window are certainly not clear, just hazy white, but we don't have that dark-orange 2pm sky style smoke.

First it already caught Spain unseasonally in April instead of July/August. The unusual cold and moist in March and April set the drought counter here in the Netherlands to zero, the severe drought from the last 4 out of 5 years seemed to be gone. But now I notice I keep my pillows outside for weeks on end, the grass turns yellow again, and now most of Europe sees insufficient rainfall. I'm not sure if the Rhine will fall dry like last year but that was a haunting sight. Orange skies are pretty rare though given there's not a lot of forested land around here. But in worst case: Scandinavia is drying up too and especially Sweden and Finland are forest-heavy. But the closest danger for orange skies is probably the Ardennes. They caught the same drought and it is a miracle we didn't have orange skies over them since 2018.\n\nAnd in Asia we saw the pictures of the dry Yangtze last year, I don't know how wildfires were over there but the drought definitely didn't go unnoticed. Farther south, Jokowi promised Singapore it won't be as bad as all other years with their orange skies but I remain skeptical, September is usually a pretty bad month in Singapore due to practices of farmers (or should I say oligarchic corporations) on Kalimantan in Indonesia.",

People go about an hour north of my hometown to fish and kayak, then cook the fish in local beer. We prepare for frozen water of all types, not a lack of water. It sounds like sci-fi.\n\nI also lived in Los Angeles for four years. I learned the difference. I still wouldn't expect an Angeleno to know the different types of snow shovels and their uses, the best use of an ice chopper, good rock salt stockpiling. It's impractical knowledge for the region.\n\nPlease allow the east coast to be in shock about today's smoke from local wildfires. It never looked like Arakis in the Mohawk Valley before.\n\nThey don't have the blessings of taco trucks, either. They have no idea how good pickled carrots can be.

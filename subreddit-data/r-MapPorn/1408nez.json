            "comment": "[Antonio Zatta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Zatta) (includes source).\n\n[\"Fusang\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusang) (here called \"Fou-Sang\") originally referred to a tree in Chinese mythology believed to be either mulberry or hibiscus. In the west the term is more famous though as a location talked about in the 7th century Book of Liang that (among many other things) chronicles the journeys of one Hui Shen. A Gandharan (roughly modern day Afghanistan) Buddhist missionary who according to the text visited China in 450 AD and then went by ship eastwards to a place where \"many Fusang plants grow\" and reported about the place to the Chinese emperor when he returned in 499 AD. \n\nThe place was said to have been located 20,000 li (An unit of measurement which nowadays refers to half a km. But at the time was closer to ~400m, so roughly 8,000km) to the East of the country of D\u00e0h\u00e0n (ie, \"Great Han\", which has also never been located) and like Atlantis many historians have been trying to locate the place based on his pretty detailed description of it. America being a common one though other claim Sakhalin, Kamchatka or even Japan. Assuming the place is (again, like Atlantis) isn't just made up for the sake of a narrative. In this case buddhist propaganda. \n\n(his descriptions of the place)\n\n&gt; Fusang is 20,000 li to the East of the country of D\u00e0h\u00e0n (lit. 'Great Han'), and located to the east of China (lit. the 'Middle Kingdom').\n\n&gt; On that land, there are many Fusang plants that produce oval-shaped leaves which are similar to paulownia and edible purplish-red fruits which are like pears. The place was rich in copper deposits and it also contained traces of gold and silver but it did not contain iron. The native tribes in Fusang were civilized, living in well-organized communities. They produced paper from the bark of the Fusang plants for writing and they also produced cloth from the fibers of the bark, which they used for robes or wadding. Their houses or cabins were constructed with red mulberry wood. The fruits and young shoots of the plants were one of their food sources. They raised deer for meat and milk, just as the Chinese raised cattle at home, and they also produced cheese with deer's milk. They traveled on horseback and transported their goods with carts or sledges which were pulled by horses, buffalo, or deer\n\n&gt; An emperor, or a main chief, with the help of several officials, governed the country. The majority of the people were law-abiding citizens. The country had no army or military defense but it did have two jails, one jail was located in the north and the other jail was located in the south of the country. Those people who had committed serious crimes were sent to the north and they stayed there for their entire lives. However, these inmates could get married. If they got married and produced children, their sons became slaves and their daughters became maids\n\n&gt; The marriage arrangement was relatively simple. If a boy wanted to marry a girl, he had to build a cabin next to the home of the girl and stay in it for a year. If the girl liked him, they would get married; otherwise he would be asked to go away ... When a person died in the community, his or her body would be cremated. The mourning period varied from seven days for a dead parent to five days for a dead grandparent and three days for a dead brother or sister. During their mourning periods, the people were not supposed to consume food, they could only drink water. They had no Buddhism.\n\n&gt; In former times, the people of Fusang knew nothing of the Buddhist religion, but in the second year of Da Ming of the Liu Song dynasty (485 AD), five monks who were from the Kipin (Kabul region of Gandhara) traveled to that country by ship. They propagated the Buddhist doctrine, circulated scriptures and drawings, and advised the people to relinquish their worldly attachments. As a result, the customs of the people of Fusang changed.\n\nGoing against the place being real is the fact that he then talks bout about another kingdom located \"1,000 li beyond Fusang called \"Land of Women\" and whose description sounds more like something from a fantasy novel. Also the first text explicitly mentions horses. Which had been extinct in NA for a good 10k years at this point.\n\n&gt; \"Where its female inhabitants were completely covered with hair, walked erect, and chattered a lot among themselves but were shy when they saw ordinary human beings. They gave birth to their young after six or seven months of pregnancy and nursed them on their backs. The babies were able to walk within 100 days and were fully grown in three or four years",

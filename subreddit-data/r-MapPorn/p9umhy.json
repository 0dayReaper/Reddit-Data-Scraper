You will go to a man(like traditional doctor) that will chop it. Then he will give you a cloth that have a hole in the middle of it (you will put your penis inside it) and some guave leaves. You will then line up with the other boys (You will hear their screams every blow of the hammer). When it your turn the man will tell you to look up and will put the blade above the foreskin and blow it with the hammer. And you will put the guave leaves and go to a river or lake.\n\n\n\nIf you have a bad luck then your penis and testicles will Swell. \n\n\n\nMost of the patient will dress (daster) like woman for atleast two weeks or during recovery time. \n\n\n\nSorry for bad explanation, I am really bad at things like this.\n\n\n\nThe woman clothing part is for comfort and to avoid the pain if the clothes touch the penis. And not for anything like shaming.\n\nOkay for saving grace the traditional is already outdated. But still some kid on countryside do it.",

Other part of Indonesia has different custom regarding circumcision, some do it on infants, some waits until the kids ask it by themselves. But more importantly, thanks to modern medical practice, hopefully no one needs to get dipped into a cold stream at 2 am and get circumcised with a piece of bamboo by a villager elder anymore.\n\nForgot to mention that there are big leeches living in the stream. My grandma lose her toenail to a leech in the stream. I guess if you're really unlucky you could get circumcised by a big leeches instead.",

By the time they arrived in Luzon in 1570s, they met Tagalogs (particularly those from Manila and Batangas) that has adopted some Muslim practices like adopting Muslim names, circumcision and not eating pork. Of all influences mentioned, only circumcision persisted to this day. Arab and Malay words (like *sonat* from Malay *sunat*, *catan* from Arabic *khatna/khitan*) used to be present in Tagalog vocabulary when referring to circumcision, along with the native terms *tuli* and *boslog*, but has sinced faded into obscurity and can only be found in Spanish-era Tagalog dictionaries.\n\nTagalogs were initially called 'Moros' (Moors) in early Spanish documents, but by 1590s, the Spaniards realized that Tagalogs were only partially Islamized and were easily converted to Catholicism.\n\nAs to how it became widespread to the rest of non-Muslim ethnic groups, I don't know since it's practiced virtually everywhere in the country today.",

I think most ethnic groups in the Philippines would have had some Muslims, some Hindus, some Buddhists, and some with a traditional religion.\n\nWith the African countries they had circumcision before Islam and Christianity.\n\nWith the USA and other Anglo countries it started as a medical thing but younger people are less likely to be circumcised.\n\nWith South Korea its mostly adult circumcision for the same reason as the big amounts of plastic surgery there, AKA it is seen as cute and porn also always has circumcised penises. But it started during the Korean War when koreans became more acquainted with american culture and circumcised penises became the standard of beauty.",

As just one data point, I looked into the source they used for reporting circumcision rate in my country (Belgium) as 22.6%, which seems way too high to me.

Yes, these authors had 22.6% circumcised men in their sample but their goals are completely different: it's a self-selected sample for a survey on penile sensitivity in circumcised vs. uncircumcised men. It's pretty wild to assume that that represents the overall average in the country.",

To obtain the best results one must cut away enough skin and mucous membrane to rather put it on the stretch when erections come later. There must be no play in the skin after the wound has thoroughly healed, but it must fit tightly over the penis, for should there be any play the patient will be found to readily resume his practice, not begrudging the time and extra energy required to produce the orgasm. It is true, however, that the longer it takes to have an orgasm, the less frequently it will be attempted, consequently the greater the benefit gained... The younger the patient operated upon the more pronounced the benefit, though occasionally we find patients who were circumcised before puberty that require a resection of the skin, as it has grown loose and pliant after that epoch.\" \n\nE.J.Spratling,\u00a0*Masturbation in the Adult*, Medical Record, vol. 24.

A long foreskin is irritating per se, as it necessitates more manipulation of the parts in bathing... This leads the child to handle the parts, and as a rule, pleasurable sensations are elicited from the extreamly sensitive mucous membrane, with resultant manipulation and masturbation. The exposure of the glans penis following circumcision ... lessens the sensitiveness of the organ...

It has been argued that the practice of circumcision, by freeing the penis of a phimotic foreskin, may have conferred a selective advantage that aided sexual intercourse and thus reproduction, so enhancing the competitive success of our species as it evolved [Cox, 1995; Cox &amp; Morris, 2010]. As such it most likely existed before our species radiated out of Africa 70,000 years ago. This is more plausible than it having arisen independently in different parts of the world. Those cultures that do not currently practice circumcision are most likely to have stopped doing in in more recent times, rather than the other way around.\n\nThere's more of this!

                            "comment": "He's kinda well known for that. He spams academic literature on the subject and consistently uses himself as a source\n\n[\u201cTwo of the authors, Morris and Waskett, both internationally recognized circumcision activists,6,7 forget to declare their conflicts of interest. Even in situations that are out of context, Morris promotes himself as a neutral \u2018authority on the extensive medical benefits of this simple surgical procedure\u2019,8 whereas at the same time he argues that neonatal male circumcision \u2018should be made compulsory\u2019 and that \u2018any parents not wanting their child circumcised really need good talking to\u2019.\u201d](https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/41/1/312/647866) \n\n[\u201cLike in critical letters to the editor following other recent studies that failed to support their agenda, Morris et al. air a series of harsh criticisms against our study. As seen, however, the points raised are not well founded. It seems that the main purpose, as with prior letters, is to be able in future writings to refer to our study as an \u2018outlier study\u2019 or one that has been \u2018debunked\u2019, \u2018rejected by credible researchers\u2019 or \u2018shown wrong in subsequent proper statistical analysis\u2019. This in spite of the fact that our study was carried out using conventional epidemiological and statistical methods, underwent peer-review and was published in an international top-ranking epidemiology journal.\u201d](https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/41/1/312/647866) \n\nFrom Robert Van Howe \u201dExpertise or ideology? A response to Morris et al. 2016\u201d: [\u201cIt will not come a surprise that an analysis that fails to portray circumcision in an unmitigatedly favorable light will provoke criticism from Brian J. Morris, a molecular geneticist and \u2018long-standing advocate mass circumcision\u2019, along with his colleagues. It is evident that nearly every such paper I have published on the topic of circumcision has been followed by a letter to the editor, attempted rebuttal, or other \u2018critique\u2019 from Morris and his colleagues. This pattern has been noted as well by other researchers with respect to their original work on the subject, and the present case is no exception. Whatever else their merits, it could be argued that these rebuttals have proved useful to the authors in that they are liberally cited in their subsequent publications.\u201d](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17441692.2016.1272939) \n\nFrom Ethicist Earp: [\u201cFor well over a decade, Professor Morris has been waging a quixotic campaign against the foreskin.[2] Although he has \u201cno involvement in clinical medicine\u201d[3] and \u201ccannot claim any more expertise on the topic of male circumcision than any other scientist,\u201d[4] Morris has sought to demonize the humble prepuce. So dangerous is this particular part of the normal male anatomy, according to Morris, that it must be removed from a child\u2019s body before he can form his own opinion.\u201d](https://www.skeptic.org.uk/magazine/onlinearticles/infant-circumcision/) \n\nMore from that same article: [\u201cThere is also a series of pamphlets by Morris,[6],[7] published in 2006 and 2007 with the controversial circumcision advocacy group, The Gilgal Society.[8] These pamphlets, designed to convince expecting parents to circumcise, openly extol the virtues of foreskin-removal while trivializing drawbacks and risks. Circumcision should be \u201cmade compulsory,\u201d[9] according to Morris, and \u201cany parent not wanting their child circumcised really needs a good talking to.\u201d These views are far outside the mainstream.\u201d](https://www.skeptic.org.uk/magazine/onlinearticles/infant-circumcision/) \n\nFrom physician Daniel Summers\u00a0 [\u201cHaving reviewed Dr. Morris\u2019s study, I find his statements about the benefits of circumcision as a routine procedure overblown, and the comparison with vaccination baseless. ... Implying that declining to circumcise one\u2019s son is as irresponsible a threat to public health as failing to vaccinate him is frankly preposterous\u201d](https://www.thedailybeast.com/circumcision-has-health-benefits-but-doctors-should-leave-the-decision-up-to-parents) \n\n[\u201cBy selectively citing Morris\u2019 own non-peer-reviewed letters and opinion pieces purporting to show flaws in studies reporting evidence of negative effects of circumcision, and by failing adequately to account for replies to these letters by the authors of the original research (and others), Morris and Krieger give an incomplete and misleading account of the available literature. Consequently, Morris and Krieger reach an implausible conclusion that is inconsistent with what is known about the anatomy and functions of the penile foreskin, and the likely effects of its surgical removal.\u201d](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274710223_Does_Male_Circumcision_Adversely_Affect_Sexual_Sensation_Function_or_Satisfaction_Critical_Comment_on_Morris_and_Krieger_2013) \n\n(More from Earp)\n[\u201cWe have covered just a few of the distortions, misrepresentations, and inadequately referenced claims in Morris\u2019s hymn of praise to childhood circumcision. To pile on more examples would lead us away from the central point. The most one can say about the medical evidence concerning circumcision is that it is contested and inconclusive. On a global scale, there is a strong balance of opinion among experts in paediatric medicine that the foreskin is not inherently harmful to health, and that the circumcision of infants is entirely unnecessary.\u201d](https://www.skeptic.org.uk/magazine/onlinearticles/infant-circumcision/) \n\n[\u201cThere are a couple of researchers who spend their entire careers pumping nonsense studies into the literature to try to make it look like circumcision is the best thing ever.\u201d](https://youtu.be/pwWhyef-5-Y?t=46m27s) \n\n[\u201cThese views are far outside the mainstream. In response to Morris\u2019s latest publication[10]\u2014comparing circumcision to childhood vaccination\u2014the paediatrician and vocal proponent of actual childhood vaccination, Dr. Russell Saunders, wrote: \u201cHaving reviewed Dr. Morris\u2019s study, I find his statements about the benefits of circumcision \u2026 overblown, and the comparison with vaccination \u2026 frankly preposterous.\u201d[11] Other experts called the analogy \u201cabsurd.\u201d[12]\u201d\u201d](https://www.skeptic.org.uk/magazine/onlinearticles/infant-circumcision/)\n\nHe also promotes female circumcision on his website. http://archive.is/rqfR6 (NSFW)",

            "comment": "As a male growing up in the US uncircumcised it was absolute hell once I became sexually active. American women that I personally had sexual interactions with had varying responses to it. All of them except 1 were \u201cgrossed out\u201d by it to some degree. They all asked the same question in one form or another \u201ccan\u2019t you get diseases and stuff?\u201d My first serious gf refused to give oral bc of that even though she said she wasn\u2019t against oral she just didn\u2019t want to do it with me. Many other women later in life similar responses wouldn\u2019t put it anywhere near their mouth. \n\nWent to Australia and spent 6 months there for my job about 5 years ago. Met a young woman there and shockingly she was so surprised I was uncircumcised and actually said \u201cI thought all Americans were circumcised I really wanted to see what that was like.\u201d Then repeated the same question many others had \u201ccan\u2019t you get diseases and stuff.\u201d My reply was always well no not if you take regular showers\u2026. \n\nRegardless it was pretty tough on me mentally. I literally gave up dating after my experience in Australia. Even though I knew there was nothing wrong with me, watching women get so grossed out by my body part made me feel like something was wrong with me and I wasn\u2019t \u201cworthy\u201d in some way. Eventually I went to a Dr to talk about circumcision and just get some info on the process if I ever did want to have it done. Some how he convinced me it was such an easy process and even had an opening the next morning for surgery\u2026 I signed up. Within 24 hours from speaking to a doctor I was circumcised and the 6 week recovery was absolutely miserable. Horrible pain. Couldn\u2019t walk for at least 3 weeks. Couldn\u2019t work. It really sucked. At the end of the day I completely regret my decision. All bc of how a limited amount of women I\u2019ve had personal experiences with were uneducated on the matter completely messed my head up. It\u2019s a fucked up subject for me to even talk about but seeing this map kinda opened my eyes. I had no idea it was such a normal thing around the world to be uncircumcised.\n\nEdit to answer some questions: I am 33 now. Had the surgery when I was 31. Cost was $2,500 US. Haven't had sex since then so I cannot compare before and after sadly as of yet. I would NOT recommend getting this surgery done as an adult. None of the women whom I had bad experiences with were bad people. All of them I had relationships with, had sex with, everything was fairly normal except the fact that oral sex was off the table and there was often conversations about if I had cleaned myself recently and if I get checked for diseases etc etc etc. The one woman who wasn't phased by me being uncircumcised at all was always playing with the extra skin and asking questions but different positive types of questions she just made me feel a lot more like I was normal.",

The king wants to legitimise things and offers the brothers anything to allow him to marry their sister. The brothers say \"impossible, unless you and all your men get circumcised\". The king was like \"yeah OK, me and all the boys will get circumcised\". They do the deed, then while they are all recuperating from the penile surgery, the brothers sweep in and kill everyone.\n\nGenesis 34 in case you were interested.",

Literally seen thousands and thousands of penises over 10 years in the industry.\n\nI really doubt the Australian statistics. Circumcised men exist, especially in the jewish community and some caucasians... but overall, I would have thought it'd be more like 10-20%. I'm also pretty shocked about middle eastern countries. The ones that came to Australia (and a lot do come to study or work) I do not remember many being circumcised from that part of the world. Even the ones who were very religious, would want a \"marriage ceremony\" before proceeding with intercourse with a girl lol. Maybe there is a reason that the ones who travelled abroad tended to almost be uncircumcised..? I really don't know.\n\nI met the occasional guy who wasn't circumcised as a child, yet decided to get it done as an adult. All stated they were very pleased with that decision, but they also had medical reasons for deciding to have the procedure. Apparently it can make you a bit hyper-sensitive at first but you quickly get used to it.\n\nI also met a lot of guys from abroad who actually probably should have got the operation, because they couldn't properly pull their foreskin down and thus it wasn't very clean down there. An older sex worker told me this is what happens when they're have not been taught as children to retract it and clean it when they are young... no idea if that is factual, but it makes sense. Men from the subcontinent tend to have TERRIBLE sexual education. So many times they would come into our Australian brothels simply wanting an anatomy lesson, trying to work out where the \"hole\" is, does the pee come out of the same hole etc. lol. They'd usually return to lose their virginity (if they didn't lose it on he first visit), because they wanted to know how to properly have sex with their girlfriend, or they had an arranged marriage coming up and wanted to be prepared for after the wedding ceremony. Of course, these are generalisations, but it really made me thankful for the type of sex education we get in Australia.\n\nOh man I had so many weird stories from those years, they were fun times.\n\nedit: Some commenters have explained to me that the explanation regarding retraction of foreskin as a child is not true - the woman who told me this had two sons, who knows what she taught them... Good to know that its not the case/an outdated belief!",

            "comment": "PSA: Be very cautious about the world circumcision map being shared around reddit, both in terms of trusting the data, intent, and how to in\n\nThe author of this [paper the map is from](https://pophealthmetrics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12963-016-0073-5) is Brian Morris, a well-known known pro-circumcision fanatic and professed circumsexual. He regularly publishes and partners with people who publish pro-circumcision papers. See here: https://en.intactiwiki.org/wiki/Brian_J._Morris\n\nThe data on this map is exaggerated, and given Morris's long history of this disgusting BS we should question why he would publish it and see it widely spread -- on first glance, the rates in these countries are WAY higher than they should be. Anything in the 95%+ range is absolutely absurd, especially in African countries that only started mass circumcising as a result of the campaigns in the past couple decades to allegedly \"combat HIV\"\u3002\n\nYes, there have been massive campaigns in Africa to circumcise, including those funded by the WHO (ugh). But to reach rates of 95%+ of all men is virtually mathematically impossible, even if EVERY baby born since 1990 in Africa was circumcised, as you still have a ton of adult men who never got circumcised at birth. Or do you think every remote village in Africa magically had someone qualified or even interested in performing a circumcision, and that 95%+ of all of the men submitted to it?  (Consider how long and hard it has taken for the U.S. to get to 50% fully vaccinated, and that's way less invasive and far more accessible/easy to administer than a circumcision -- keep in mind that many of these countries that don't even have fully developed health care systems or staff to administer the procedures!!\uff09\n\nMeanwhile, I've regularly seen porn videos of men online from countries like Turkey or Egypt or Philippines or South Korea who are uncut, especially younger generations. To suggest that 90%+ or 95%+ of the country is cut is again somewhat outlandish, especially in Muslim countries or the Philippines where it's not traditional to be cut at birth, but instead later in childhood or early puberty. There's no way 95%+ of parents remember to bring their boys in to be cut, or have the ability to pay/access to the procedures, or even want to have it done in a modern, more secular era. Not to mention, several of these countries listed in the darkest red have non-Muslim minority populations that don't even traditionally cut.\n\nSame with the 9% in Japan -- what, nearly 1 in 10 men?! My experiences in Japanese bathhouses (where men of ALL ages walk around completely naked) beg to differ. When I visited, I usually would be the only cut Asian guy in the entire bathhouse of 50-100 men.\n\nTake this map with a HUGE grain of salt and anger. Yes the general color trend is generally accurate, but the figures are exaggerated as if normalize circumcision/MGM as a good thing.\n\nThis guy totally gets off (literally, sexually) on more and more boys being circumcised. We should question his motives and only share this map VERY cautiously. Morris is fucking fanatic and literally I would not be surprised if many of the members of this community are literally cut BECAUSE of the fake and disgusting pro-circumcision science he peddles, like creating this map and getting it published.",

Their gross income due to tourism are similar (France a bit higher), but while in France it represents just a 8.4% of GDP, in Spain it amounts to a 14%. That means that the French economy is much more robust than the Spanish one. When the pandemic hit, Spain lost that 14% of its GDP, so the blow was more severe than in France.\n\nA smaller percentage means a smaller reliance in a very volatile source of income.\n\nThe strong dependence on tourism in Spain, Portugal, Greece... has other perverse effect: the degradation of human capital. Instead of industrial workers or high value tertiary sector, the countries become a place for waiters and hotel personnel, many with very low qualifications and living on a very unstable income.",

And it shows!\n\n\nGreece does the tourist thing really really well, they\u2019ve had a lot more practice! Every little village has a charming little hotel or two. Restaurants have pictures in the menus or just have the food out in trays for you to point at. \n\n\n\nTourism isn\u2019t something new that makes the locals grumpy like in so many other places, it\u2019s just a regular part of the local economy, and has been for a very long time.\n\n\nAnd the weather is spectacular!",

The hotels, restaurants, bars, transportation infrastructure, etc, all have *drastically* improved.  But I think we were also grumpy in the 80s and 90s.  There are several reasons why I think tourism industry workers have changed dramatically.\n\nLike you said, it takes decades to build a large tourism industry.  The modern-day mass tourism started gradually in the late 60s.  Tourism arrivals were 1.6 million in 1970.  34 million in 2019.\n\nBut part of it is also competition with Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, Croatia, Turkey, etc, that has forced innovation.\n\n&gt;Every little village has a charming little hotel or two.\n\nOh, the tourism industry has been a huge friend of historic preservation. Depopulated historic-architecture towns in the Peloponnese region (like the Mani peninsula) or in Corfu, have been revived and restored by the tourism industry, and now it's starting in Crete's interior.  Some of these depressing towns I remember as a kid in the Peloponnese region 30 years ago, and it blows my mind how transformed they are today.  After the destruction of neoclassical Athens in the 60s, I'm beyond ecstatic to see tourism incentivizing historic preservation (and revival) in other parts of the country.\n\nHappy to hear positive input!",

That said there was never much of   anything historic there to be destroyed. But it does happen.\n\nMostly I just came here to say times have changed. Even here in the U.S. there is a move away from homoginized and franchised tourism and toward authenticity. Real authenticity that cannot be faked. And what that means is real localism, conservatorship, pride and development of what makes a place unique wheter that be food and drink, history, natural beauty or all of the above.\n\nI started joking about pigeon forge but it is the gatway to Great Smokey Mountains National park. A very real and authentic and wonderful place.  So in a way its existence is a wonderful foil.  As soon as you step out of the town you are in national park and all of the cheap flimsy carnival fake stuff is gone. That said even Pigeon Forge is changing. Impossible for me to explain as I have only been through there twice in the last 30 years. On the one hand its more ridiculous then ever  on the other hand there are some parts that are actually... nice. LOL.",

The market was dominated by the Holy See and well-to-do customers outside Italy, primarily royal houses and nobility.\nPurchases were made in conjunction with the almost obligatory educational journeys that were made, \"le grand tour\".\nThe Swedish King Gustav III also made such a journey southbound, heading for Italy and Rome. The trip took place quite late in his life and lasted from September 1783 to August 1784, approximately half of which time was spent in Italy.\nEven though he travelled incognito as the Count of Haga, it was already known that the Swedish King was a prospective buyer of marble sculptures and art objects.\nOn New Year's Day in 1784, Gustav III and his entourage were shown the collection of ancient sculptures in the Vatican, Museo Pio Clementino. Their guide was no less than Pope Pius VI himself.\n\nhttps://www.kungligaslotten.se/english/articles-movies-360/the-royal-palace/2019-06-07-gustav-iii-and-the-museum-of-antiquities.html",

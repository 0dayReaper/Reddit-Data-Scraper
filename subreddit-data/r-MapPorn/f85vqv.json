Linked-in, Facebook, and Twitter being the easier ones to get information from.\n\nCross reference the employees of companies at the work end with their respective public data on the other platforms and you would probably get a very short list (using just the assumptions from above).\n\nThere's likely a heap of useful information in the history of the reddit account.\n\nIf you wanted to get super creepy, it's London, there's almost certainly publicly available surveillance footage at or around either end. Even if there isn't, there's publicly available surveillance all around London, and they've been everywhere.\n\nMy original point about the endpoints was incorrect, it's not enough data on it's own, but given all of it, maybe.\n\nFucking creepy though.",

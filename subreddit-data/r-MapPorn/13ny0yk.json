            "comment": "The most important thing is that there's no formal distinction between cities and towns in Poland. This differentiation, commonly found in the Anglosphere, is irrelevant in many Continental European countries, including Poland. In this country, all urban settlements are governed by the same type of city charter. There is only one official term for them: \"miasto\". We also have a diminutive word, \"miasteczko\" (a small town), but it's very informal and typically refers to towns with no more than several thousand residents.\n\nInstead, we have two types of mayor titles: prezydent miasta (literally: the president of the city) for cities or big/mid-sized towns and burmistrz (from the German word 'B\u00fcrgermeister') for smaller towns. This is only a ceremonial distinction, as both have exactly the same responsibilities.\n\nIn general, translating Polish administrative terminology into English can be challenging without further explanations. It's often easier to find more accurate analogies in languages such as German or French.\n\n\"Municipality\" may be the most neutral translation of \"miasto\" (especially if we don't know its size), although this term sounds formal and it refers rather to the local government than to the city/town itself, but seems valid as there are no unincorporated urban settlements here, because the law excludes such a possibility.",

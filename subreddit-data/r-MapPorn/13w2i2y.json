While most colonies had little to no direct control Leopold had a standing army in the tens of thousands spread out over the entire colony, and he carried out extensive infrastructure works so it could intervene wherever he needed them. He even was in direct competition with the British Empire to annex the Katanga region, and he won.\n\nedit: This myth that Leopold somehow stumbled his way into the Congo simply because other countries wanted a \"buffer\" takes away the agency Leopold had in every step of the process, and the resulting atrocities. He had his eyes set on the Congo long before he got foreign recognition, he actively worked towards it for a decade, and by the time the other powers did recognise his control it was already a fait accompli.",

They wouldn\u2019t have direct control over ever km2 or every person, of course, but it was enough to have a rule of terror and horror and crimes against humanity over the populace.",

History lessons are typically biased in the West due to anti-western storytelling, which doesn't put the events of history such as colonialism &amp; slavery in the historical context while portraying the west as the boogeyman instead of the ones that dismantled slavery in the world. Colonial empires such as the Omani empire, Ottoman empire, and the Khedivate of Egypt, which have weakened Africa with colonialism, imperialism &amp; slavery before the Europeans came. The use of Sudanese in agriculture has become fairly common under Muhammad Ali of Egypt and his successors, but these are the facts we cannot tell the world.",

You *volunteered* that 'actually POC countries are just as bad' from virtually no prompt. So you'll excuse me if I find that explanation somewhat unpersuasive.\n\n&gt;Shine light on understudied cases such as the genocide and expulsion against the Germans after ww2.

We couldn't tell their stories because politics, similarly how colonialism and slavery became a 1-sided topic to hate certain groups of society that are low on the intersectionality ladder solely for the way they are born, not for who they are...\n\nI have no idea what the 'intersectionality ladder' is, but as someone from a country bordering Germany (as you are) - whose biggest movie 5 years ago was a WWII story about the horrible treatment of Germans in my country after WWII (which was nominated for an Oscar), I have no idea what you're talking about when you say \"we can't talk about that.\" We do talk about that. Again this year the biggest budget movie made in my country is about German refugees being treated horribly after WWII. These are stories we tell in books, in film, that gain international attention and praise. If these were things we \u2018couldn\u2019t talk about\u2019 that wouldn\u2019t be happening.\n\nAnd we can tell stories about slavery outside of the West. Or colonialism outside of the west. Because it's important to understand history in its totality. But when someone volunteers - without being prompted - that \"did you know non-white countries are just as bad?\"...my spider sense tingles a bit.\n\nBecause the reality is that while slavery has existed everywhere, and colonialism has existed everywhere...the horrors inflicted by European powers in the transatlantic slave trade, or imperial colonialism spanning the globe...are in a league of their own. And that's why I talk about making a false equivalency. By all means, let's talk about it, but let's not pretend Japanese Imperialism from 1890-1945 or Ottoman Imperialism holds a candle to that of the centuries of worldwide subjugation and oppression at the hands of British, French, Spanish et al. It's a difference of kind, not degree.",

We couldn't talk about the struggles of the Germans in the past due to politics. Politics have changed, and the new topic we can't fully talk about without unilateral examples is colonialism and slavery. Furthermore, for a long time, the topic of the German expulsion has been silent and still is not recognized as a genocide nor taught in Germany either. That's not without a reason\n\n\n\n&gt;the horrors inflicted by European powers in the transatlantic slave trade, or imperial colonialism spanning the globe...are in a league of their own\n\nWere they? Why is the trans-Atlantic slave trade more horrible than the trans-Saharan slave trade? I find it always hard to compare the cruelties in this world but I think it can be safely argued that the experience of the trans-Saharan slave trade might be worse due to the travel through the Sahara during the cold nights compared to traveling by boat. These kinds of nuances aren't usually considered. \n\nAlso, considering the causulties of the trans-Saharan slave trade might be higher, although we will never be sure since other slave trades weren't as researched well, above all, Europeans wrote it all down but that doesn't mean that the unwritten did not occur or is not of importance. This is a typical case of survival bias. Estimates are between 10 to 18.5 million (including European casualties). They are both tragedies. I don't think you can rank or league them. Horrible things occurred everywhere in history. Notorious slavery rules such as the castration of male slaves in the Ottoman empire aren't a league on their own for you? Again, I think it's immoral to compare. Everyone did bad things\n\n&gt; let's not pretend Japanese Imperialism from 1890-1945 or Ottoman Imperialism holds a candle to that of the centuries of worldwide subjugation and oppression at the hands of British, French, Spanish et al. It's a difference of kind, not degree.\n\nWhy is it different? Conquering someone else's land to expand your own has always occurred in worldwide history. Countries oppressing each other, forced convertions, genocides and taking slaves. It all happened in all parts of the world, including Africa and the America's, and they are all tragedies. But why is it not the same? Lastly, the Ottoman and Japanese empires were absolutely massive. Arguably, we could add the overseas Omani Empire empire too as well as China conquering many foreign lands, including Tibet and definitely Indonesia, who tried to unify their 'greater indonesia' plan and committed many genocides. I don't see your point, but you might enlighten me.",

The post you responded to said nothing about this.\n\n&gt;I'm curious: What's the name of this movie?\n\nThe Oscar nominated one 5 years ago was [Land of Mine (Under Sandet)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Kao3t0NBMU), and the new one is [N\u00e5r Befrielsen Kommer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt20519254/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). That one doesn't have a trailer yet.\n\n&gt;Were they? Why is the trans-Atlantic slave trade more horrible than the trans-Saharan slave trade? I find it always hard to compare the cruelties in this world but I think it can be safely argued that the experience of the trans-Saharan slave trade might be worse due to the travel through the Sahara during the cold nights compared to traveling by boat. These kinds of nuances aren't usually considered.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Also, considering the causulties of the trans-Saharan slave trade might be higher, although we will never be sure since other slave trades weren't as researched well, above all, Europeans wrote it all down but that doesn't mean that the unwritten did not occur or is not of importance. This is a typical case of survival bias. Estimates are between 10 to 18.5 million (including European casualties).\n\nPutting aside the fact that an estimated 12 million slaves were freighted across the Atlantic in a span of 400 years (vs 6-10 million slaves over the course of 2000 years in the case of the Trans-Saharan slave trade), The Transatlantic Slave Trade is generally considered unique because of the structural racial component to its chattel slavery. You were a slave because you were of a race that was meant to be slaves, and there was no way for you or your descendants to get out of slavery.\n\n&gt;They are both tragedies. I don't think you can rank or league them. Horrible things occurred everywhere in history. Notorious slavery rules such as the castration of male slaves in the Ottoman empire aren't a league on their own for you? Again, I think it's immoral to compare. Everyone did bad things.\n\nWith respect, you think it's immoral to compare because if we *do* compare it's clear which powers have more blood on their hands.\n\n&gt;Why is it different? Conquering someone else's land to expand your own has always occurred in worldwide history. Countries oppressing each other, forced convertions, genocides and taking slaves. It all happened in all parts of the world, including Africa and the America's, and they are all tragedies. But why is it not the same? Lastly, the Ottoman and Japanese empires were absolutely massive. Arguably, we could add the overseas Omani Empire empire too as well as China conquering many foreign lands, including Tibet and definitely Indonesia, who tried to unify their 'greater indonesia' plan and committed many genocides. I don't see your point, but you might enlighten me.\n\nSo. Like I said, the difference is one of of *kind*, not degree. That means that at some point the scale and scope of your 'moral ill' enters a new category. If this is a moral concept you aren't able to grasp intuitively, then I think we're at an impasse here. If you think there's no difference between Nazi Germany and The US in WWII because they *\"both did bad things and we can't compare the severity of those bad things\"*...I don't know what to tell you, or how to enlighten you.\n\nFor instance, in the case of French of British Imperialism the entire world was more or less subjugated and and oppressed in ways that still to this day impact those countries in devastating ways. Wealth, resources and people was taken and destroyed to such an extent that even a hundred years later the effects are ruinous.\n\nAs bad as major powers like Japan and China have been to their regional neighbors, you cannot show me a map of the world with Chinese colonies on every continent for hundreds for years. You cannot show me borders in South America, or Africa or The Middle East that were permanently redrawn by the Japanese. You cannot show me entire continents that were left permanently impoverished because of the concerted efforts of Chinese colonialism.\n\nThe difference is of kind. Not degree.\n\nAnd pretending like we cannot compare moral ills, in my opinion, is what's immoral.",

Like I said before, it's hard to really pin it down because only Europe was educated enough to write it all down, it could easily be over 12 million considering the length. Even after the Europeans banned it out, which is hardly ever credited due to selective storytelling\n\n&gt;The Transatlantic Slave Trade is generally considered unique because of the structural racial component to its chattel slavery.\n\nSo you argue it's the racial component that makes it unique? Why wouldn't this apply to the Trans-Saharan slave trade? Or the Barbary slave trade or any slave trade that fetishized white women? But it is true that there was a racial component mainly because of their resistance to tropical illnesses and the availability by African slave sellers. \n\n&gt;You were a slave because you were of a race that was meant to be slaves, and there was no way for you or your descendants to get out of slavery.\n\nNot exactly, this is what I mean with seeing everything black and white without historical context. This is the BLM version of history, which creates polarization within our society by defining one's value based on skin color rather than all the nuances in the world. The main nuances are that there were in fact black slave owners and there were also white slaves. Even if this rule of yours were to be true then it wouldn't be applied to all geographic locations because chattel slavery in Europe didn't even exist by 1200, so it wouldn't be universal. What is universal is the concept of slavery regardless of skin color.\n\n&gt; you think it's immoral to compare because if we do compare it's clear which powers have more blood on their hands.\n\nI don't think it's clear. I don't think comparing is inherently immoral, like it depends on the context.\n\nIf I find time (prolly tomorrow) I'll reply to the rest. There's a lot to unpack",

For instance south of Ankole and north of Rwanda there was Ndorwa, Rujumbura, Kinkiizi, Kayonza, Rukiga, Kabale and Rubanda; these were small clan confederations and independent of the autocratic kingdoms that surrounded them. Around Rwenzori there are the Bakonjo/Banande. \n\nWest of Lake Kivu there was Bahunde, Bahavu and Bashi polities. Rwanda spent a lot of time attempting unsuccessfully to conquer the Bashi but succeeded with Idjwi Island as they had done previously with the clan confederations of the southern flanks of the Virunga Volcanoes. \n\nEast of Lake Tanganyika and west of Mwanga was Uvinza, a salt-based kingdom similar to Katwe kingdom (until Bunyoro tried to conquer them), which is also not referenced. \n\nAlso note that the Tippu Tip's lands were a Zanzibar colony founded in the 1860s for the purpose of slave trading. \n\nSome clan units could be very small for many different reasons, perhaps descendants of previous rulers, or, by contrast, those whose livelihoods depended on gathering and hunting in forests, swamps and marginal lands supplemented with crafts.",

Let me burst your bubble and bring you back to reality.\r First of all, relying on ancient maps to justify Morocco's claim to the Western Sahara is about as logical as using a crystal ball to predict the weather. We live in the 21st century, my friend, and international law and diplomacy have come a long way since the medieval ages.\r Secondly, just because Morocco may have controlled some territory centuries ago doesn't mean they have a valid claim over the Western Sahara today. This kind of thinking reeks of imperialism, which, in case you haven't noticed, isn't exactly considered cool or acceptable these days. The world has moved on from the days of colonial powers carving up maps for their own selfish interests.\r It's high time you understand that the principles of self-determination and respect for the rights of indigenous populations are far more important than outdated maps or power-hungry ambitions. The people of Western Sahara have the right to determine their own future and not be subjected to some nostalgic fantasy of Moroccan domination.\r So, instead of indulging in cringe-worthy fantasies of past imperial glory, how about we embrace progress and support the self-determination of the people living in the Western Sahara? It's time to let go of the imperialistic mindset and start respecting the rights and aspirations of all people, regardless of their history or geography.",

The European colonizers in Africa worked incredibly hard to prevent the emergence of a native land or capital holding class, whereas in the East those classes already existed and had to be adapted into the political and economic structures of colonialism.",

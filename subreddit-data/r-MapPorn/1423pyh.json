I wouldn't call these \"immigrants\" in the same way most people in the world perceive the word. These people essentially have the same culture &amp; speak the same language, and they were all a part of the same country until the war. Most of them even have the same nationality to begin with, Croatian.\n\nOr something has drastically changed there in the last 10 years, some major immigration wave that I'm not aware of.",

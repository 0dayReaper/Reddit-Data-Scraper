I believe the reason that most cities are built within the interior of Mexico is because back in the day most of population already lived in in the central part of Mexico where Mexico City is located. Trade and travel was so difficult because of the monstrous mountains that people just stayed close to the interior. Monterrey Tijuana and Juarez are a little bit of a different story.",

Despite the massive size of Mexico City, the population of the country is relatively spread out. For comparison, Tokyo alone accounts for approximately 30% of Japan's population. \n\nOther interesting notes: of the top ten, 6 are in central Mexico and 4 in the north. None in the south.  The area that they cover is in reality smaller than what is depicted, as an entire municipality's surface area will be considered part of a metro area, even if portions of it are unpopulated. The top ten cities had kept their same positions for some time until the last few years, where the growth of Monterrey meant it would surpass Guadalajara as the second most populous, and Quer\u00e9taro would surpass two other spots with an incredible population growth rate of 20.66% over the last census.",

That being said, I have full faith that the current toxic parties that control Bihar will die lose their stranglehold before the end of the decade and BJP will form a pro-development govt there like they have in UP.  \n  \nAs for West Bengal, the party in power there is literally islamist thugs who rig elections and use street muscle power to remain in power, but since they oppose Modi and BJP they get media backing and manage to continue their reign of terror, corruption and anti-development.  \n  \nIt might not be apparent from maps like these, but the Bengal economy is falling so far backwards that RBI data shows that Bengal is more dependent on federal funding than even UP (although Bihar is obviously no 1)",

Majority of Bengaluru is populated by outsiders, and most tax contributors are from north, because iirc, Karnataka doesn't have a single disctrict where they export goods nearwhere 750 crore. Therefore most of economy is dependent on services, on top of it, IT services specifically\n\nAnd IT personnel are from north, when I went there, was surprised how much Hindustani/Hindi is used in IT sector companies. Which are the biggest tax paying entities in Karnataka\n\nAnd i think overall Hindi/Urdu used in Bengaluru itself is proof enough for it. I mean the city is deep in the middle of southern India, you wouldn't expect those languages to be used there.\n\nNot to forget the crime and violence against north Indian IT workers, which has been going on for more than a decade. So Bengaluru isn't much of a \"star city\", but Hyderabad actually is, no one can deny that. Cuz it'll be the biggest beneficiary from all that hate and violence.\n\nCuz the opposition recently won elections, and they'll find any topic to garner votes, including Amul-Nandini shitfest, or recent re-selection of Waqf Board members by Congress",

I am aware that Bengaluru has many north indians, but not sure how deeply entrenched they are in its IT industry, since the majority population (something like 2/3rds) is still mostly south indians, and hindi speakers only comprises like 5% of the state population while urdu speakers are at 15% and tamils are at like 20%.  \n  \nI'm not from Bengaluru or ever spent enough time there so I might sound a bit ignorant, but just going by what the data says about linguistic and demographic prevalence of hindi speakers.  \n  \nAnd while Bengaluru is the economic epicenter of it's state, there are many other regions with economic activity too, like Mangaluru which is home to major petrochemical refining industry, Belagavi with its aluminium and aero industries, Bellary district home to JSW's biggest steel plant, not to mention the auto, agro and textile industries spread all over the state. Sure Karnataka might not be the richest south state without Bengaluru, but it would at least be on par with Andhra Pradesh.  \n  \nAnd yes the rising racism of kannadigas to outsiders might go on to hurt its appeal as investment destination compared to Hyderabad, Mumbai, Ahmedabad and NCR, but it remains to be seen until what extent that happens.",

And within IT, you will observe that Hindi is common in the sector, you can ask your dad if he has worked with as much companies as me in projects.\n\n\n\n&gt;And there are almost no northeies (except in coaching institutes) in any other sector.\n\nThere isn't any scope for jobs in Karnataka, except in IT sector. IIRC, Karnataka doesn't even have a single district which is exporting finished goods over 750 cr.\n\nSo financially, everything in Bengaluru is dependent on IT, and thus, everything in Karnataka is dependent on outsiders, except Infosys and Wipro, which, again, has majority of workers from non-karnataka region",

The most common dowry and western nurse mindset is the one where the husbands family will pay to bring in a bride. While in south Asia, the most common is where the brides family will pay the husband\u2019s family to take the bride. this comes down to a difference in mindset most dowries, see the woman as an valuable asset so they\u2019re willing to pay for her. A woman is looked at in south Asia as a negative asset. This is because the family now has another mouths to feed. The brides family will also provide some kind of jewelry for her to keep in private in case she needs to sell it for some money for whatever reason.",

They take exception to the word in the national anthem that states we are a young nation. Most Australians won't sing that anymore they'll say one rather than young. It's a contentious issue to call them new. \n\nThe native Americans have nothing to do with that\n\nEdit. Downvote me all you want people. Homo sapiens only truly became a global species during a later migration, spreading out across much of Asia and down into Australia after about 60,000 years ago. Even then, the earliest dates for the arrival of modern humans in Europe come in at roughly 42,000 years ago.",

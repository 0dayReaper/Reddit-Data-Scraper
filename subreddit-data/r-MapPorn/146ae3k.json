There are also schools in which all lessons are in Irish all over the island referred to as Gaelscoil.\nThe reason why so many people are using Duolingo for irish is down to how Irish is taught in schools, which is to say badly. Duolingo is a much better, more enjoyable way to learn a language you will eventually have to sit an exam on.\nAlso it\u2019s Gaelic or Irish.

I (based on absolutely no knowledge of the subject) would have expected those two countries to study another Western European language, like French or German. \n\nI understand the attraction to learning Spanish in North America, particularly in the US. Mexico is big and populous and we share a border. We have a vibrant and thriving Central and South American immigrant population, the vast majority of whom come from Spanish-speaking countries. \n\nAnd, IIRC, Spain is a huge vacation and expatriation location for Brits, so I understand it there, too. \n\nPNG surprises me less because there is still a large Spanish-speaking community in the Philippines, if what I\u2019ve read is legitimate. They\u2019re not that close to each other but they\u2019re not very far apart, either. \n\nThat English has such a huge swath makes sense to me. The places French has the hold make sense to me. Everything else makes sense to me after, at most, a quick Wiki read about early 20th Century global political situations. \n\nBut Australia and New Zealand primarily studying Spanish doesn\u2019t make that much sense to me. But, again, that\u2019s based on knowing little to nothing about the cultures of those countries besides what I\u2019ve seen in movies and TV.",

Also France has promoted the likes of Alliance Francians to set up shop in Anglophone countries like South Africa and Kenya where they strongly promote High Schools to teach French as a foreign language subject rather than say German(Both Kenya and South Africa), Mandarin(both)and  Arabic(Kenya). Over time though, I see Mandarin overtaking French in many of those countries.",

Bengali people already understand spoken Hindi really well but are not interested at all in travelling to India for future prospects. India does not have very good prospects for Bengalis in that regard anyway.\n\nOn the other hand, young Bengalis are more interested in going abroad in western countries like USA. Duolingo is mostly seen as a tool to learn new languages. Why use it to learn a language you already know?\n\nAnd speaking from personal experience, bollywood interest seems to be dwindling now. My family and my friends don't watch bollywood at all these days compared to 5 years ago. Not sure what happened, but everyone just suddenly lost interest other than for the classics.",

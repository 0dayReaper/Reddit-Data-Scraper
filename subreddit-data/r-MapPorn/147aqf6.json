[This link](https://www.djfood.org/brian-eno-ambient-2-music-for-healing/) shows notebook drawings for the album covers including an unused one for Ambient 2. These apparently are from the book \"Brian Eno: Visual Music\". \n\nThe locations are completely fictional it seems.\n\nElements look similar to cropped photos of real locations of an atlas created by [Italian artist Luigi Ghirri](https://www.thewalkman.it/luigi-ghirri-atlante/) in 1973. I don't think there's any relation between Luigi Ghirri and Brian Eno, but given the time period, I wouldn't doubt if Eno consciously or unconsciously saw this or something similar and was inspired to create his album covers that resembled  this style.",

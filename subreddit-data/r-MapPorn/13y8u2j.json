Tatars were banned to move back to Crimea until Ukraine became independent.\n\nIf you want to learn about actions of Russia under current leadership, you can start from the fact that the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant against Putin for ordering mass kidnapping of Ukrainian children, moving them away from their families and educating them with Russian propaganda: [https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-ukraine-icc-judges-issue-arrest-warrants-against-vladimir-vladimirovich-putin-and](https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-ukraine-icc-judges-issue-arrest-warrants-against-vladimir-vladimirovich-putin-and)",

And even when DNR and LNR claimed to be independent states, they always were fully controlled from Kremlin.\n\nYou show a border between Crimea and the rest of Ukraine. There is literally nobody who would claim that there is a border there. Ukraine and anybody who understands the political geography a bit recognizes Crimea as part of Ukraine. Russia claims Kherson(the region north to Crimea) to be part of Russia, so no border there from Russian viewpoint. The line of control also isnt there.\n\nSo what exactly that \"border\" is based on? Well, it aligns well with pre-2022 Russian propaganda. Your viewpoint is clearly based on Russian propaganda, I guess your head just didnt update it to the current version yet.\n\nThis is likely because Russia invested tons of money into propaganda all around the world, while the UN/international/Ukrainian point of view didnt enjoy so much money. And media supported by Russian money were successful to put their propaganda in your head. Now when the active war is going on and lots of media cover it, its much harder for propaganda to make you think that Russia is right.",

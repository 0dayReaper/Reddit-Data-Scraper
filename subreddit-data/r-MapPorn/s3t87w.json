Blind Faith's cover seems alright, although the jury's kinda out on it. She's certainly posed as an adult, and it seems her lips are painted, which kinda defeats the \"innocent naked child\" argument. The Scorpions one is just all kinds of fucked up. Like straight up child pornography. Incidentally, I know for a fact that Germany and Denmark had *huge* amounts of child pornography being produced at the time (probably other countries as well, this is just my national shame shining through). Point being, it seems a *lot* like Scorpions or their management just contacted a child pornographer and asked him to do the cover for them. If anyone is looking for some cursed knowledge, try diving into the prevalence of legitimate, open and legal child pornography that was produced in that era. Denmark decriminalized porn in 65 but didn't criminalize child porn until 85.",

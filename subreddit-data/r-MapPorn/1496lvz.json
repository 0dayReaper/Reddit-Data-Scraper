            "comment": "This kind of map is always misleading by nature, because a lot of people naturally tend to speak several languages, and this kind of map also puts emphasis on minorities.\n\nBut for south america it's even worse. For example, looking at this map, you'd have no idea that a majority of paraguayans are actually speakers of spanish (74% of Paraguayans) and guarani (77% of Paraguayans), with only a tiny minority of monolinguals (4% only speak spanish, 8% only speak guarani).\n\nAnd only 1% of the total population speak other native languages. The rest speak mostly brazilian portuguese or other colonial languages (german mostly).\n\nAnd this is a situation that you'll find in many other regions. This map shows a lot of native languages spoken by very few people who also, almost always, speak spanish/portuguese and maybe even another native american language (such as Quechua).",

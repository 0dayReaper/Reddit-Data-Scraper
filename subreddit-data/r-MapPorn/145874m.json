And that it's only really after they acquired guns and horses that they made the area around the Dakotas and the Southern Canadian Prairies their home. Displacing the prior inhabitants in the process.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux\n\n&gt;They were dispersed west in 1659 due to warfare with the Iroquois. During the 1600s, the Lakota began their expansion westward into the Plains, taking with them the bulk of people of the O\u010dh\u00e9thi \u0160ak\u00f3wi\u014b. By 1700 the Dakota were living in Wisconsin and Minnesota. As the Sioux nation began expanding with access to horses, the Dakota were put in a weakened position to defend the eastern border: new diseases (smallpox and malaria) and increased intertribal warfare between the migration of tribes fleeing the Iroquois into their territory of present-day Wisconsin",

The most logical theory was that he was from the crown of Arag\u00f3n, a part of the Spanish Empire so he would have no problem in working closely with Castilla, and linguistically, his errors of Spanish could be due to him having Catalan as a native language according to linguists.\n\nEdit: he could also be Galician or Portuguese.",

In these writings, Columbus claims that he was born in the city of Genoa.\n\n&gt;Although some scholars question the document\u2019s authenticity, the vast majority of historians agree that such documents are genuine\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;Columbus's early life is obscure, but scholars believe he was born in the Republic of Genoa between 25 August and 31 October 1451. His father was Domenico Colombo, a wool weaver who worked in Genoa and Savona and owned a cheese stand at which young Christopher worked. His mother was Susanna Fontanarossa. He had three brothers\u2014Bartholomew, Giovanni Pellegrino, and Giacomo (also called Diego)\u2014as well as a sister, Bianchinetta. Bartholomew ran a cartography workshop in Lisbon for at least part of his adulthood.\n\n&gt;His native language is presumed to have been a Genoese dialect (Ligurian) as his first language, though Columbus probably never wrote in it. His name in 16th-century Genoese was Cristoffa Corombo, in Italian, Cristoforo Colombo, and in Spanish Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n.\n\n&gt;In one of his writings, he says he went to sea at 14. In 1470, the family moved to Savona, where Domenico took over a tavern. Some modern authors have argued that he was not from Genoa, but from the Aragon region of Spain or from Portugal. These competing hypotheses have been discounted by most scholars.\n\n&gt;In 1473, Columbus began his apprenticeship as business agent for the wealthy Spinola, Centurione, and Di Negro families of Genoa. Later, he made a trip to Chios, an Aegean island then ruled by Genoa. In May 1476, he took part in an armed convoy sent by Genoa to carry valuable cargo to northern Europe. He probably visited Bristol, England, and Galway, Ireland, where he may have visited St. Nicholas' Collegiate Church. It has been speculated he went to Iceland in 1477, though many scholars doubt this. It is known that in the autumn of 1477, he sailed on a Portuguese ship from Galway to Lisbon, where he found his brother Bartholomew, and they continued trading for the Centurione family. Columbus based himself in Lisbon from 1477-85. In 1478, the Centuriones sent Columbus on a sugar-buying trip to Madeira. He married Felipa Perestrello e Moniz, daughter of Bartolomeu Perestrello, a Portuguese nobleman of Lombard origin, who had been the donatary captain of Porto Santo.",

Tribes to their east referred to them as \u201cfoxes,\u201d a custom the colonial French and British continued. [source](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Fox-people)\n\nIt's a strange artifact of Europeans' westward push that the European names assigned to them correspond to the names nations to their east gave them. Presumably nations to their west called them by other names.",

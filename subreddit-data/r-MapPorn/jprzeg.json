The People on reservations in SD (and I'm assuming, AZ) are mostly full blood and often live lives very separate from the general population.  Also, Oklahoma was mostly de-reservated in the early 20th C., while reservations in other states are still very  distinctive places.",

Mostly de-reservation was because of the Dawes Act of 1887, the stated goal of which was to integrate American Indians (most of the Indians I know would rather be called Indian than Native American) into the general American culture.  The actual purpose of the Dawes Act was to take Indian lands away so Americans could continue moving westward and settle those lands themselves.  The Dawes Act assigned acreage to specific individuals so that land could no longer be owned by the tribe communally, which was tradition.  There were actually several OK land rushes as various parts of Indian Territory then Oklahoma Territory were opened to White Settlement after de-reservation.  You should really read about the Dawes Act; it's fascinating, and screwed up the lives of Indians for generations.  Even now some tribes require that to have tribal membership you have to prove that you descend from someone who was listed on the Dawes Rolls.  So someone who is mostly \"white\" can claim membership in some tribes purely because they descend from 1 person on the Dawes Roles (each tribe has different blood quantum rules.)  Kahn Academy has a good article about it but the URL is crazy long.",

The [1866 Treaties](https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/u-s-treaty-creek-nation-1866/) are quite brief and easy to read. They affirm the reservation boundaries and also say that the tribes have a say over any non-tribal member who wants to enter their land (and this summer's *McGirt vs. Oklahoma* upholds these treaties).\n\nBut yes, the second half is correct, the Dawes Allotment Act was to facilitate land theft. The Oklahoma Historical Society is a good, short source on such topics: [Dawes Commission.](https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=DA018)\n\nLand runs affected tribes throughout Oklahoma, including Plains, Plateau, Southweat, Great Lakes, Prairie, and Northeastern Woodlands tribes, not the just the Southeastern tribes.",

My use of the word \"stolen\" was probably too extreme. The tribe was REQUIRED to sell the land to other Indian tribes, then those tribes lost control of the land after oil was found.",

There are also multiple, distinct nations in the state and the way that the Navajo Nation relates to state and national politics might be very different from how the Tohono O'odham Nation does (the latter is currently being cut in two by the border wall, which is destroying land &amp; life that's sacred), but there are probably at least some commonalities as well. I can't speak at all to life on the reservation. I'll try and keep this strictly to what I can actually say for sure. \n\nSome of the reservations are pretty rural, with the Navajo nation being the biggest example, but many Navajo people live down in Phoenix or up in Flagstaff while still having strong ties to family living on the reservation. Some of the communites/nations are in or directly adjacent to the Phoenix Metro area itself like the Gila River Indian Community &amp; the Salt River Pima Maricopa Community. \n\nI really can't say much that wouldn't be guessing, but it seems at least that reservations being distinct places with distinct populations isn't mutually exclusive with people being integrated into broader society in Arizona.",

My wife and I stopped at one of those rode side shops for Native American jewelry.   Its crazy how night and day the reservation is to all the towns that surround the reservation.\n\nThere is virtually no farming happening in the Navajo area.  A few cattle farmers but thats basically it.  The land is not good for farming.  It gets cold in the winter and hot in the summer (unbearable on both ends).   Its not a good place to live.     I doubt there is clean water to many of the areas.",

There were back-and-forth lawsuits between the tribes and the US government about who could be admitted to the rolls. Their applications were marked as \"rejected,\" so it's funny on genealogical discussions when white people say, \"My great-great-grandmother was one the Dawes Rolls and it says 'rejected.'\" Uhhh... that means they weren't Native. [More info](https://www.powwows.com/final-roll-of-the-cherokee-nation-and-freedman/).\n\nGenealogical forums are also full of stories of \"$5 Indians,\" i.e. white people paid $5 to enroll. Those stories are horseshit.\n\nThat being said, Intermarried Whites (marked as \"IW\" on the rolls) was a designation for white people who married into tribes, but they are not enrolled and their non-Native descendants (from other marriages) are not eligible for enrollment.\n\nYes, there are many so-called \"thinbloods\" in several Oklahoma tribes. The majority of tribes in Oklahoma don't have a minimum blood quantum (don't want to marry your cousin), so they grow exponentially. Many Native people here have European, African, and even Asian and Middle Eastern ancestry, and that diversity will likely increase over generations. On the flipside many people enrolled in tribes here marry Latino people of Indigenous descent.",

If a lot of \"Latinos\" took a DNA test  they'd see they were at least 50% Indigenous to this continent making them *Native Americans*.  There was push for Latinos to identify as Native in the 2020 census.    In my experience when you say this to Latinos they respond with kind of an imposter syndrome as though they don't have the right to claim their race because they are so culturally disconnected but having your cultural identity taken away from you is a part of the genocidal tactics the US government used and it's a central part of our experience.    \n\n\nHowever, you don't need a DNA test.  You just need to ask yourself which continent your people are from as no other race in America is asked for proof of their race or for registration papers as proof as if humans are dog breeds.  No other race in America is asked to be pure.  You know what group of people is obsessed with racial purity? White nationalists.   Black people aren't less black because they aren't into their African tribal culture.  A white person isn't less European because they don't know their ancestral customs. \n\n\nSo any of you  Latinos out there who are obviously not the European ones (ex Ted Cruz), don't let people make you think you aren't Indigenous.  Your ancestors are from the **American continent** and it is your homeland.",

But blood qauntum is a pretty sensitive issue amongst various tribes. The United States government set out to do their best to disenfranchise as many natives from their treaty rights as possible by creating the concept of blood quantum. So you can't be Lakota if you are like, Araphao, even if you are both. And blood quantum is not how many tribes, specifically plains indians pass on membership to their tribe, lineage and traditions. It's really crappy that a lot of kids being born have get kicked out of their tribe because of this. And it also forces natives in a particular tribe to have to consider whether they should only date and marry within their own tribe, so their children can stay enrolled member. Okay? Then think about the math....you are constantly trying to figure out how to not date a relative as your tribals enrollment dwindels as a result. That's Genocide. Right there. I'm white, but I have native family. My niece, can't be enrolled. She still gets a 25 cent check in the mail from a random place she owns rights to with like 500 second cousins that a white farmer probably is living on and leasing. Fuck the Dawes act.  Fuck what the US government did and is still doing. That's what the Dine said with that vote because so many people died from Covid on their reservation. With none of the promised help from Trump.",

Affiliated with the larger Liberal Democrats, and broadly similar in their views. Which is to say centre or centre-left.\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party: Hardline Unionist and Eurosceptic, and ranging from right to far right. Aside from opposing Irish Unification, they're just generally very socially conservative. Opposing gay marriage, abortion, etc. Members often caught saying extremely bigoted shit.\n\nUlster Unionist Party: Unionist and somewhat more centrist overall. Often affiliated with the larger Conservative Party, and are similarly centre-right. They were the dominant Unionist party for most of Northern Ireland's history, but lost most of their support to the DUP.\n\nTraditional Unionist Voice: A newer Unionist party founded by people who thought the DUP wasn't extreme enough. Pretty much everything I said about the DUP is also true of them, except somehow less subtle.\n\nIt's also important to note that while Sinn F\u00e9in is obviously a nationalist party first and foremost, they're also the primary leftist party of Northern Ireland in general. Which is part of why they've had so much growth in recent years. A lot of their voters aren't necessarily nationalist, but still vote for them because they campaign for things like same-sex marriage, abortion rights, etc. \n\nSo this isn't all down to the nationalist/unionist divide, but also the standard left/right one.",

Both were leftist and had similar overall goals, but Sinn F\u00e9in was affiliated with the IRA and endorsed the armed campaign against British rule. They were (and are) also abstentionist, meaning that they refuse to take their seats in Westminster when elected. The SDLP was always opposed to that and was for many years led by John Hume, who was all about non-violence. Even won a Nobel Peace Prize. They're also non-abstentionist, so they've got a fundamentally different approach to participation.\n\nIn short, Sinn F\u00e9in was militant and utterly non-cooperative towards the British government while the SDLP took a more moderate approach. During the Troubles the SDLP was the bigger nationalist party specifically because Sinn F\u00e9in was so controversial and defined by their ties to the IRA. But since the end of the armed campaign, they've gradually been eating the SDLP alive.",

This is especially true of the more extreme elements of either side. Hardcore Unionists are almost always far-right while hardcore nationalists are almost always far-left. \n\nWhich you can see clearly in their associated paramilitaries during the Troubles. Unionist paramilitaries have a strong history of association with far-right/neo-Nazi movements like the BNP. Whereas on the nationalist side you had communist groups like the INLA and IPLO. The IRA itself had a strong communist element up until 1969, when the communists were basically booted out. After which their ideology was more like democratic socialism, which is still the ideology of Sinn F\u00e9in.",

Due to the fallout and investigation nationalists pulled support and collapsed the assembly(government) as part of returning to the assembly they insisted previous promises would be honoured Irish language act, gay marriage and a few others. This was seen as 'standing up' to unionist arrogance.\n\nAn underlying reason is demographic change as seen in the most recent census the nationalist community has a faster rate of population growth. It's hard to quantify how much this plays out in the electorate but in total population(&gt;18s included) there are now more people from a Catholic background than protestant. We should see a steady increase in nationalist vote in each election going forward this has been visible for the last 4 years.\n\nThe above map shows local election results which usually have a lower turnout so I wouldn't read too much into the results.

I believe 40-45% is accurate but I'm biased. As long as the Republic of Ireland maintains a strong economy and improves public services support should grow. \n\nI don't think there will be unification this decade unless there is a significant political development such as Scottish independence. The demographic change is likely accelerating and contrary to popular belief Sinn f\u00e9in and Irish identity are stronger among young people(&lt;25) than the current generation(25&lt;).\n\nIn short the current trend is towards unification in the 2030s but major political events could change things.",

            "comment": "1) The map maker says that they didn't have sources for Madrid (he relied on linguistic maps), and so clearly states that the map is incomplete. I'm assuming that the remaining empty spots are for that reason.\n\n2) The map maker said that they purposely excluded the most common used terms, like mariquita, sanant\u00f3n, sanatonio, as well as more uncommon and widely spread out ones, like \u00e1ngel, virgen, sapo, rana santarrita. I'm not in agreement with this choice, I would have liked to see them as well, but I'm not the map maker.\n\n3) These names are often accompanied by a second name, e.g. perr\u00edn de dios,  perr\u00edn de san antonio de llantones etc. For the purpose of clarity - at the disadvantage of completeness - the map maker has excluded all second or third names, leaving only e.g. perr\u00edn.",

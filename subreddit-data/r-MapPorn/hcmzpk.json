Having a fuel efficient vehicle will make a difference over time when you're doing thousands and thousands of miles in a trip, especially in state with expensive fuel. \n\n\nUse your network of friends and family to find places to crash for free throughout the country. Wherever this is lacking you can use hospitality exchanges like Couchsurfing to find places to stay for free. And then there's camping on public lands which is easy and free, although less prevalent in the eastern half of the US. Not the coolest thing in the world to do but you can arrive late at night at established campgrounds, which charge fees, and leave super early in the morning without having to pay. I recommend everybody pay their fare share but I was younger and on a tight budget before so who am I to judge. \n\n\nFood can be prepped at any homes you stay in. You can cook over a fire or with a small propane or butance stove whenever you're camping. Eating regional specialties is a huge part of why I love traveling. You'll undoubtedly end up doing some of that so budget accordingly. Just like cooking at home, eating cheaply on a road trip is certainly feasible and doesn't have to be anymore expensive than it would be at home.\n\n\nThe last longer road trip I did was about 5 years ago. It was a little over two months, ~13000 miles and cost me maybe $2500 max. And it didn't feel I was denying myself many experiences along the way because of this small budget. I'd argue you certainly don't need to be anywhere close to rich to do this. I'm not naive enough to say it's possible for everyone. If you have a lot of debt or financial obligations you probably won't have the means to take that much time off and sustain yourself. However, I do think it's possible for most people with a bit of planning and frugality, and those with little to no major financial or social obligations (kids, sick parents, etc).",

If you drive 100km/hour and do 6 hours of driving per day it will take you 12 days alone.   When you factor in stopping for gas, washroom, and food , that 600km day ends up being a 7+ hour day. It is not realistic to drive all day and into the evening for ever day, you will burn out.\n\nThe Arctic/Tundra is also a nasty place to drive. Both gravel and paved roads are in rough shape. You can get terrible weather and even snow in the summer. Assuming you can always do 100km is not realistic, and road repairs will have to happen every summer.",

Most of the journey will be through southern Russia where the roads are shit, but its not arctic/tundra by any means. That being said, 115-120km/hour is totally doable there and pretty much all of the continental US. Furthermore, in the open road driving is very peaceful, i think the average person can drive at the very least 8 hours pretty consistently. I definitely think 900-1000km daily on average is a much more reasonable amount for your everyday person.",

                    "comment": "Okay. So. I did some math. According to [this article from CNN](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/trans-siberian-road/index.html) the distance from London to the tip of Alaska would be 8,064 miles. Doing some rough estimation of the route based on OP's map in Google Earth gives a distance from Alaska to New York of 4,257.53 miles for a total travel distance of 12,321.53 miles. The average miles per gallon for new cars in the US is 24.9 mpg, so let's use that. Assuming you're driving highway speeds the entire distance, we end up with:\n\n12321.53 mi / 24.9 mpg = 494.84 gallons of gas\n\nAccording to [this document](http://www.patagoniaalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/How-much-carbon-dioxide-is-produced-by-burning-gasoline-and-diesel-fuel-FAQ-U.S.-Energy-Information-Administration-EIA.pdf), each gallon of E10 fuel (the most common in the US) creates 17.68 lb of CO2 when burned. So...\n\n494.82 gal \\* 17.68 lb/gal = **8,748.78 lb CO2 for the trip by car.**\n\nUsing more Google Earth estimations, the distance between New York and London is about 3,500 miles. According to the second table on [this post](https://paullaherty.com/2015/01/10/calculating-aircraft-co2-emissions/) (which I don't care enough to independently verify), a coach seat for 3,500 miles on a 777 (which is the first aircraft I found that does make nonstop flights between London and New York) generates a total of 889 lb of CO2.\n\nAccording to [this chart](http://www.worldshipping.org/industry-issues/environment/air-emissions/WSC-CarbonDioxide.png) which is provided by a shipping company, so take the accuracy with a grain of salt, a bulk carrier generates 7.9 grams of CO2 per tonne-kilometer. What this basically means is that for every ton *and* every kilometer, 7.9 grams of CO2 are generated. So, to find out the total amount of CO2, we need to multiply 7.9 by the weight of the car (in tonnes) and by the distance from New York to London (in kilometers).\n\n* Distance: 3500 mi = 5570.77 km\n* Weight of car (assuming passender sedan): 4094lb = 1.857 tonnes\n* CO2 emissions for shipping car: 7.9 \\* 5570.77 \\* 1.857 = 81724.87 g = 180.17 lb\n\nSo, your total CO2 emissions for shipping our car and flying (assuming both the ship and plane were going anyway and you're only counting your individual contribution) is:\n\n889 + 180.717 = **1069.717 lb of CO2**\n\nCompare this to the **8,748.78 lb CO2** for driving the trip, and it's pretty clear the flying and shipping your car is *way* more CO2-efficient.",

Everything else is connected by rail: you have to change gauges somewhere in Eastern Europe and then back presumably at the Bering Straight Bridge, but the rest of the way is already built. And there is an argument to be made that those areas are going to become a lot more populated once global warming makes the winters less soul-crushing, the road maintenance less impossible, and the possibility of self-sufficiency slightly less than completely out of reach: some day soon, livestock will be able to live in Alaska and Siberia, for example. And we have food storage techniques; if those areas go from USDA zone 0/1 to zone 3/4, you have a lot more options and the cost of living isn't completely outrageous.",

Trains would also have a lower cargo capacity than a cargo ship.  So trains would be an intermediate cargo class compared to air freight, and would be an express option for items that cant be air freighted or would be completely uneconomical to do so.  Say you needed a giant transformer right now, you can get one from china in 4 weeks or you can get it in a week.  Its costing your customer $1million a day of downtime.  How much are you willing to pay to ship by rail?",

The North American plate actually extends into the Russian far north-east, making the Bering Strait crossing easier than, say, Gibraltar or even the much much narrower strait of Messina (also because the Bering Strait is very shallow).",

No.  \n\nConservatively a project of this scale would cost in the trillions of dollars, and there simply isn't an economic justification for something like this.  The hardest part about the future is realizing that just because something is possible doesn't mean it's going to happen.",

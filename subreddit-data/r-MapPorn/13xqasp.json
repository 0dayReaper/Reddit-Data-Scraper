            "comment": "The Founding of Tenochtitlan was created by tlamatinime (the male and female scholar-artist-philosopher class) of the city. Rather than convey only space, the map conveys spacetime over a period of 52 years, explaining Tenochtitlan's sociopolitical landscape, demographic data, military prowess, and agricultural output. Each illustration contains vast data, and is an example of picture writing unique to Mesoamerican culture, where drawing and writing is combined to communicate information in a three dimensional landscape. This map contains equivalent information to perhaps a 2000 word essay. \n\nIf anyone's curious I can explain the meaning of each glyph and how it works, or provide information about Nahua philosophy and cartographic tradition, which according to Barbara Mundy (1998), and James Maffie (2014) is more complex than contemporary Western cartography, because it is capable of rendering spacetime. The Founding of Tenochtitlan is particularly time-inflected. Other maps resemble more closely western maps, so not all of the maps looked like this. \n\nIndigenous scholars were baffled by the European incapacity to understand such illustrations (De La Cadena), as for them temporal abstraction was as logical as photorealism is to western culture, or minimalistic landscape maps are to Sinitic Japanese culture.\n\nMesoamericanist scholars argue adopting Indigenous cartography today would be conducive for communicating ecological data more efficiently. I love this topic!",

I see them often, simply for their beauty. Forgive me if I do not use the correct words\u2026Please explain more of its meaning. This is fascinating. I am curious about the circles, both with and w/o dots in their centers and how they affect meaning of the repeating imagery (rabbit w teeth or __ animal that is represented) w the placement of them in the squares around the outside? Also, what is the meaning of the 4 stories\u2014the bottom looks like they won a military battle over two other groups (?), but am sure it\u2019s much more complex than that\u2026\nHand drawn floorplans were, at least by those who taught me eons ago, was considered (a much simpler) language with its own symbols &amp; documentation most outside the industry would not recognize (like the type of window that would be used in an opening). I was one of the last classes taught hand drafting &amp; design strictly by hand. Computers were quickly taking over &amp; were advanced enough they drew many things automatically already. (How I got out w/o more computer time baffles me, but I am grateful!) Students could use a directory to choose a widow and the software would draw it automatically. They did not have to learn them, at least not immediately.\nI can certainly understand how the scholars were baffled at the Europeans inability to understand! When doing residential work or giving a presentation in a public setting like a small town city council or board room, we almost always took in much less detailed floorplans with many more realistic perspective hand drawings, *often watercolored*, on how spaces would look, so not to overwhelm the client(s) with what plumbing fixtures were hidden in walls. We put the focus on the aesthetics and function of space and materials one would see in those meetings. However, the City Building Department got the notated and complex versions with both barrels. They DID NOT want coloring.  Lol\nBut how specifically are they notating TIME?\nAlso, what did they use for the blue paint\u2014that is one of the most difficult colors to produce. During that time period, many minerals and ground stone were used. But this is so PRISTINE with little fading. Incredible.",

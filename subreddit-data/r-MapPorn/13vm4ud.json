How they're able to survive is a mystery to me.\n\nEven as a software engineer, I had to move back with my parents(luckily I can work remotely) because I can't afford living by myself. At this point working on-site costs more than being a NEET.\n\nWe earn 1/5 of what they earn and everything is 1.5-2 times more expensive compared to Europe.  We're doomed.",

In the Netherlands schooling basically remains compulsory up to the age of 23 until you have qualifications that make you employable according to the government. In countries that periodically have experienced high youth unemployment the concept of being 'employable' probably carries a lot less weight, because they rarely hit the bottom of the barrel.\n\nThere are some exceptions. Some Eastern European countries can apparently have a high number of NEETs and low unemployment. That is probably an artifact of how both statistics are counted and the large number of young people that work abroad. These may be NEETs for the statistics.",

Pennsylvania may have more dense urban areas or higher poverty rates than other states, which could lead to more instances of theft. California may have larger populations, more tourist areas, and more retail outlets which could lead to an increase in theft. Arkansas may have a large population of young people and high unemployment which could also lead to more instances of theft. Additionally, there may be less effective prosecution policies or law enforcement resources in these states, leading to higher rates of retail theft.",

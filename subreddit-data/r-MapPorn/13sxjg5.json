You're splitting a city in half. People that live in Gatineau, Quebec, but work in Ottawa proper (in Ontario) have to deal with *two* time zones.\n2. Likewise, you're splitting the NYC metro.  You're splitting off southwest Connecticut from the rest of the NYC metro area. And *all* of Connecticut is economically intertwined (Hartford and New Haven to Bridgeport to Stamford to New York).  So, this is another fail.\n3. Splitting metro St Louis, because -again- of an arbitrary state line\n4. Splitting the Quad Cities metro area, which straddle Iowa and Illinois.\n5. There's probably lots of other examples.\n\nThis is why the current time zone borders are where they are. They have to be drawn *around* metro areas, and not split them. State lines are arbitrary.  You have to go by settlements and metro areas, and draw time zone borders through the least-populated *possible* path.\n\nAlso: North America isn't just the USA and Canada.",

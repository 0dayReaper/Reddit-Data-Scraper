Specifically I'm talking about the coal mining of Appalachia,  Northern England/Wales/Southern Scotland and northern France/Wallonia/Western Germany. IDK if there is anything to it but just felt noticable to me.",

Because of millions of years of erosion they are not 'real' high mountains any longer like the Alps or Rockies for example.\n\nNot sure about the coal part. I guess because of erosion the coal deposits might have been partially exposed or less deep under ground and easier to excavate than other places? But early coal mining has a lot more socio-economic and historical context to it too. \n\nOne theory is that the English already adopted coal powered ovens as early as the 17th century because they were constantly running out of firewood on the British Isles, so the search for alternatives started sooner than other places in the world. Which in turn accelerated the developement of other early industrial technology.",

I will say that the mountains being eroded meant they were closer to the major cities on the coastal plain that were settled because of easy access to maritime trading routes; needing to pass over the Pennsylvania Appalachians to move your coal to factories in New Jersey was less a logistical hurdle than it otherwise would have been.\n\nBut, the largest and most productive coal producing state in the US today is Wyoming. The coal there was formed much more recently and as such is practically right on the surface, in formations/seams that are over 100 feet thick (very large for a coal seam) and snake around the entire state. \n\nIn this case, less erosion is good for ease of access to the coal and kept the seam almost perfectly intact. It was just inconveniently located in the middle of the continent (also why it formed in the first place) so it wasn\u2019t mined extensively until it could be sufficiently accessible by railroad in the mid-20th century.",

Which in turn accelerated the developement of other early industrial technology\n\nAlso apparently the constant insufficient supply to meet all the firewood demand in Britain forced the state (or the power structures that preceded the modern centralized state, which were local feudal lords) to set up fairly sophisticated systems of forest management (controlled logging, replanting, growing the right species for making efficient use of the land)  so as to have a more or less sustainable supply of the precious resource for heating, cooking, producing charcoal for running smelting furnaces and ship building. It was a level of resource management and economic policy that was in itself a huge step forward for Britain to keep growing its economy.\n\nThere's [an episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/409Ov1v3chhzSurUUukWry?si=e73733a3233348a9) of the podcast Tides of History where the host interviews an expert on these matters.

During this time trees had just evolved, but bacteria that could eat and break down wood had not. So when trees died, they just sat on the ground and slowly were compressed by the dirt and other trees above them. This mass of carbon eventually was buried deep enough that it was heated to form coal. \n\nSo, during that time the Appalachian mountain range and the rest of these were just forming. They were created by NA, Europe, and Africa slamming together in the process of forming Pangaea. Many of the densest forests today form on or near mountains, due to the rain shadow effect: mountains stop clouds from going further so they dump all their rain onto them, which then trickles down on one side of the mountain while the other is left dry. I think it could make sense that these mountains had a similar effect and therefore had large lush rainforests along them, similar to the Himalayas creating the jungles and plains of India or the Andes feeding water to the Amazon.\n\nBut again, not a paleontologist, this is just a guess and could be totally wrong.",

At that point it was still Gondwana, the breakup of Gondwana started initially about 180 to 200 million years ago during the Jurassic period and continued until the end of the Cretaceous period about 66 million years ago.\n\nWhat this map shows is 1st: Disintegration of the supercontinent Pangea: Around 200 million years ago, the supercontinent Pangea, which encompassed most of the earth's continents, began to split up.  The departure formed new continents such as Laurasia (North America, Europe and Asia) and Gondwana (South America, Africa, India, Australia and Antarctica).\n\nAnd 2nd: Formation of the Atlantic Ocean: The Atlantic Ocean was formed by the drifting apart of the continental plates of North America and Eurasia on the one hand and South America and Africa on the other.  This process began about 200 million years ago and continued for millions of years",

It's been tweaked and moved a bit over time and formalised in the 1530s but that border didn't cease to exist with the laws in wales act in the same decade. This was about ending the marcher system and making wales centrally goverened and represented in Parliament. \n\nWales had already been legally annexed in the 1200s.",

It did not become part of England, it remained a separate realm until Henry VIII. Well, several realms, the Principality and the Marcher Lordships.\n\nThe 1746 Wales and Berwick Act confirmed that the term 'England' also legally covered Wales, so the border had indeed disappeared. The 1967 Welsh Language Act repealed that and so the border reappeared again.\n\nIndeed, at that time there was some wrangling about the border regions and what exactly should be in Wales and what in England, so the border was not as set in stone as you suggest.",

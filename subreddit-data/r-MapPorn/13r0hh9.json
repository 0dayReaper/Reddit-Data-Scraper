Unfortunately, Bihar's ruling politicians are more concerned with petty politics through prohibition, caste census, handing out govt jobs to lazy fuckers and more caste politics than implementing policies that encourage economic development.  \n  \nI hope the likes of Nitish and the Lalu family get wiped out and a BJP govt can come in and start developing Bihar like they have been doing in UP.",

The biggest party of its time, the secular Congress (India's first ruling party) was against the zamindari system and wanted it abolished once in power. The result was that Muslim feudal lords and businessmen threw their support completely towards the separatist Muslim League. A large part of their leadership were zamindars or royalty. Their funding and influence ensured a large part of ML's success across Muslim reserved seats that became pivotal in creating Pakistan.",

Even though not all ingredients in the pot do accept us, it is economically in favor of the state to no longer criminalize our deeds, and let corporations do rainbow capitalism.\n\nThis might come off as rather cynical, but I also believe, even as a socialist, that it's good when capitalism, for once, plays out in favor of marginalized minorities.",

All commercial traffic going to Mumbai will be diverted to Gwadar and Mumbai will fall into despair.\n\n2) Pakistan economy will grow at a faster pace than India's. Companies will pull out of India and invest in Pakistan because then they have direct access to Chinese markets as well.\n\n3) Pakistan will become a major energy hub as Chinese oil that goes through Malacca will all flow via CPEC. In addition to many new Oil and Gas Pipelines which will connect to Pakistan\n\n4) Indian IT industry will crumble as Pakistan overtakes it in IT exports (?? Never understood this one)\n\n5) Pakistan will isolate India in South Asia as all countries in South Asia will participate in CPEC.\n\n6) Due to Pakistan's new economic and diplomatic might, they will be able to pressure India to free Kashmir (because of course it all comes down to Kashmir for the average Pakistani)",

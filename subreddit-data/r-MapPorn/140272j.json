De exemplu, in engleza \"broadcasting\" era la inceput o metoda de aruncat semintele in agricultura.\n\nUn caz interesant este la porumbel\n\nla primele limbi indo europene era un cuvant care insemna gri &gt; apoi, la romani, cuvantul ala a devenit palumbes pentru a descrie porumbelul, de la palumbes la noi a aparut porumb, porumb putea insemna atat ceva colorat gri, dar si pasarea in sine, dupa a aparut porumbul din america si cred ca, oamenii, vazand \"porumbii\" mancand noua cereala, au numit planta dupa pasare si apoi pasarea porumb a devenit porumbel, totusi pentru animale gri inca se mai foloseste \"porumb\" cateodata (desi acum pe mine ma face sa ma gandesc la galben). \n\nScuze, am luat o pe aratura :))\n\nSol e neologism si de tarana nu stiu exact cum sta treaba, dar nu cred ca a venit pamant mai tarziu fiindca in toate limbile din zona nu e niciun cuvant similtar pentru pamant de la care sa provina. \n\nDar vad pe wikipedia ca in limba sarda pamentu inca inseamna podea",

A notable exception is Romanian: the most common expression for Earth, P\u0103m\u00e2nt, is derived from Latin pav\u012bmentum (\u201ca floor composed of small stones\u201d, related to English \u201cpavement\u201d). Note that I was not able to find any information about the origin of the Walloon word Daegne.\n\nSlavic and Baltic languages are also very uniform.

And that's a great loss.\n\nFrance is the last country to not have ratified the EU chart on minority languages. Bravo.",

Occitan (of we consider all its variants as single language) has according to estimations between 1 to 4 million speakers, Arabic has around 2M speakers.\n\nDarija is indeed spoken a lot but isn't widely spoken by descendants of immigrants,  they would know common words, understand it but not speak it commonly much like what's seen in most regional languages (I am a Basque speaker myself, know it, we use it in family but not outside, much like darija speakers). And you're omitting the ones speaking Berber languages not Arabic.\n\nAnd Arabic isn't a regional language of France. Not even in Mayotte. English, German and Spanish are all more spoken than Arabic.",

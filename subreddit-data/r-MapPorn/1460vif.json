With a bit of money, you can convince a driving instructor to waive most requirements. \n\nAs mentioned in an earlier post, I know many, many people whose road tests consisted of little more than \"turn on your vehicle and take a left turn without crashing.\" \n\nHaving said that, there are many unwritten rules. Once you understand these rules, navigating Indian traffic is easy (and, once you're outside of a large city or town, there's rarely any significant traffic anyway). \n\nThe key to surviving on Indian roads is to 1. assume that everyone else is an incompetent idiot, and 2. act like an incompetent idiot who's oblivious to everyone around them, since that's what you're expected to do. \n\nLegit, following standard traffic rules in India is a great way to endanger yourself. See pedestrians about to cross the street? Better fucking accelerate, because nobody--including the same pedestrians, who've already started walking into highway-speed traffic while staring at their phones--expects you to exhibit an ounce of courtesy.",

The different markings on roads signifying dedicated lanes for U turns/ Regular Left or Right turns is also hard to find in India.\n\nIf you learn these rules then driving wouldn\u2019t be that hard for any driver from India in the US or other countries.\n\nWhereas in India you have to be really mindful of your surroundings, like lose focus for a few seconds and you could crash into someone. Also due to quite a few roads being narrow as hell (sometimes only 1 lane for both incoming and outgoing traffic) you\u2019ve got to have a very clear understanding of your blindspots, because you\u2019d need to deal with very narrow clearances. \n\nSo there is both an advantage and a disadvantage for an Indian driver to drive in foreign countries",

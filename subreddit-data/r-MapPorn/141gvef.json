There are currently \\~24000 identified soldiers.\n\nblack and red = higher losses per population in a region  \nblue and green = lower  \nsize in squares = total population of this region\n\n**Lowest rate per capita**:\n\n^(Moscow - 1.31)  \n^(St Petersburg -4.13)  \n^(Tyumen O. - 6.12)  \n^(Moscow O. - 6.28)  \n^(Ingush Rep. - 7.82)  \n^(Tula O. - 9.98)  \n^(Kaluga O. - 10.07)\n\n**Highest rate per capita**:\n\n^(Tuva R.- 92)  \n^(Buryat R. - 72.97)  \n^(Nenets AO - 65.11)  \n^(Zabaykalski K.- 57.21)  \n^(Magadadan O.- 55.89)  \n^(Chukotka AO. - 53.96)  \n^(Altai Rep. - 45.13)\n\n**A comment on Muscovites**\n\nMoscow has \\~12.6m people, but contributed 166 dead ID'd soldiers. Tuva has \\~0.3m people, but contributed 306 dead soldiers. Southern Fed District is similarly sized to Moscow at 14m - it has 2531 dead ID'd soldiers.\n\nIt's tempting to think Muscovites (i.e., people from Moscow) are sending those troops, but Russian elite is not especially Muscovite. Just 4 of the top-30 most influential Russians are Moscow-born in 2018 Forbes' list. It's 3 in a less econ-oriented top-30 list from Centre of Political Technologies.\n\nMeanwhile, the opposition is extremely Muscovite. Moscow accounts for \\~9% of Russia's population, but between 25% to 73% people convicted for protests, depending on the year. (OVD Info)\n\nA disproportionate amount of anti-war opposition leaders are from Moscow. Navalny, Yashin, Kara-Murza, etc. are also from the area. This is especially true for the liberal opposition. But holds for armed opposition (like the Russian Volunteer Corps as well as individual actors).",

To Russians this is entirely reminiscent to the build-up of the other invasions, they are entirely convinced NATO will invade them in the near future.\n\n2014 was the breaking point, their largest European neighbour was now Western alligned and seemingly more and more likely to host NATO troops and even join the alliance, and now with the War being in full swing if Russia loses then NATO will 100% be stationed in Ukraine and Ukraine will join the alliance.\n\nImagine if Canada had an anti-American revolution tommorow and made steps to host Chinese troops on the US border.\n\nTheir whole mode of thinking is outdated, as long as Russia has nukes it will never be invaded, but state propaganda and a national trauma lend itself to perpetuate the idea that Russia is under threat and must be defended by disarming Ukraine.",

Its not a treat to Russia itself, its only a treat to Russian imperial ambitions to invade other countries.\n\n2. &amp;#x200B; Russians arent idiots like you picture them. Some of them are, but vast majority understands that NATO wont invade them. They support this war simply because they are imperialists and want their country to control Ukraine, Eastern Europe, and whatever they can control. They feel that Ukraine is their colony and they have a right to control it.\n\nRussians do NOT view it as WW1, WW2, Napoleonic. And this map is another proof for that. You think Tuvinians and Buryats are better Russian patriots than Russians themselves?\n\nRussians want to occupy Ukraine and are ready to pay some price, but they dont want to risk their own lives for it. Thats why Moscow doesnt have tons of volunteers like Kyiv has and its mostly the poorest Russian citizens who fight because the government promises crazy money.\n\nAnd Putin clearly knows all of this. Nobody knows what happens if people in Moscow get mass drafted to the war, but Putin clearly has zero desire to find out.\n\nAnother dimention is that its not just about people. Weapons matter a lot. Europeans were able to colonize so much not because they had more people or cared to win some war in Africa, America, or Asia more than natives, its because they had better weapons. Russians had full support of weapons from Americans during the WW2.",

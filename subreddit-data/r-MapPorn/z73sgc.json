The top 5 most wanted places right now are: North Korea, Bouvet Island (which had a failed dxpedition a few years ago), Crozet Island, Scarborough Reef, and San Felix Islands. Most of the top 30 are islands but Turkmenistan and Syria are both in that range.\n\nBut yeah, so that is how it happens. They raise money to go on a dxpedition and hopefully they are successful and run their radios nonstop for their alloted time.\n\nTechnically I'm a ham (extra) and know a bit about the culture by association, but mostly did it so my FIL didn't disown me. I'm a very good test taker and not a great concepts person....",

Part of putting out a radio signal is that you never know where your signal will make it to.  So we try to explore that and push the limits.  So even someone just chiming in and say \"Bonjour, you're making it into France\" or \"Hi, I'm across the state from you, so groundwave is looking good\" teaches us about our signals and propagation.",

Or Chile. One of the countries down by the tip. He put a pin in it after some conversation. A few English conversations, mostly pleasantries and location sharing. Some more general, some down to the city. But always friendly and willing to chat for a few minutes at least. There was one guy in Montana he talked to regularly, never exchanged contact details but talked weekly for years.\n\nMostly if there wasn't any chatter, and he wanted to try someone new, he'd spend a few minutes doing a call/response for his \"station\" before moving on, sometimes he'd get a response but often it was just silence.",

I suppose the reason I added that was to help people understand it takes barely any power at all to communicate around the world.

Higher frequencies tend to either punch through the atmosphere or get absorbed by moisture.  \n\nSomething else people usually are impressed with; you can literally talk to an astronaut on the ISS with just a handheld ham radio. \n\nThere\u2019s no age restriction to get your license.

They would go to various locations across the UK with their massive aerial setup and see how far they could get replies from. They got a reply from Germany once. \n\nThen they decided to drive up to the Scottish highlands one weekend and see if they could get even further. My Dad was in the van plugging in cables etc as Ray and my uncle Tony were outside putting the aerial together. It was a particularly foggy day and they lifted the aerial directly onto electrical pylon cables in the sky above. Ray and my uncle Tony were killed instantly and my Dad was pretty frazzled with his hair sticking up and black fingernails. My Dad had to walk miles in the cold to get help. \n\nPossibly the only time being into CB radio has killed people.",

Sometimes it seems like magic but it's all physics.\n\nThe sun has an 11 year cycle of activity. We just came out of a period of low activity into a period of high activity. During periods of high activity, the sun ejects more charged particles, which excites the earth's ionosphere more.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle\n\nWhen the ionosphere has more charge density or becomes thicker, it will propagate signals more easily, and at higher frequencies.\n\nChoosing the right frequency band for the current conditions is part of the skill of making long distance contacts. We call that \"DXing\" where DX is an abbreviation for \"long distance\".\n\nThis is one part of the hobby that really interests me. Learning about geophysics and solar dynamics was not something that I expected to participate in, but it seems like there is a lot to learn and there is ongoing research in these areas.\n\nLet me know if I can clarify further. 73",

PJ2 is the [ITU prefix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU_prefix) for Curacao, and his home callsign is LA9DL.  So when operating in Curacao there is an international agreement that he doesn't need a local license and callsign, he can just stick a PJ2 prefix on the front and his callsign becomes `PJ2/LA9DL`.\n\nSecond is his maidenhead grid square when operating in Curacao: `FK52mc` -- Hams use a system that abbreviates location to 4 or 6-character grid square.  This is known as the [Maidenhead locator system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maidenhead_Locator_System).  You can use this map link to see what this grid square covers, and to click around to map to discover your own grid square.  https://k7fry.com/grid/?t=t&amp;qth=FK52mc\n\nThird is the date that he was operating there, January 2010.\n\nLastly is the \"Islands on the Air\" number for operating from this location, `SA-006`.  \"Islands on the Air\" (IOTA) is an award program where people try to make verified contacts with as many islands around the world as possible in order to make a personal achievement and receive awards. See more here: https://www.iota-world.org/\n\nSo he is providing this information so people can make appropriate updates to their contact logs, and can work towards awards for contacts.  Hams have programs to encourage operating and provide personal achievements.  So for example, if you contact 100 different countries, you can apply for the \"DX Century Club\" award, which has been an ongoing since 1937.",

If you want to go up north from the coast, the easiest way is to follow Le Rh\u00f4ne (big river), since going a tad more east means dealing with The Alps, and going more west means dealing with The Massif Central . So being close to that river is kinda major, especially for a port city with a lot of exchanges (Look at a French topography map if I'm not super clear, my point will be more obvious).\n\nIf your trade routes can dodge the mountains, it's easier, less dangerous, and you'll win some time. It's actually the reason Lyon (also a huge density on the map), is also a big french city. You pretty much had to traverse it to go up north (and it's also a hard city to take militarly speaking, protected by those same mointains). Lyon was also the Gaul capital, meaning having \"direct\" access to it was valuable, and once again, Marseilles (Massilia back then if I'm not mistaken), was well placed for that job.\n\nOfc, this is not the only reason but the big tldr is, super old , extremely well placed to go up north.",

Hurtful language about body image can have significant negative impacts on an individual's mental health and self-esteem. It may also be triggering. When someone is subjected to derogatory comments about their appearance, they may begin to feel ashamed or embarrassed about their body, leading to feelings of low self-worth and poor body image. This can result in harmful behaviors such as disordered eating or excessive exercising to change their body in an attempt to conform to societal beauty standards. Moreover, hurtful language about body image can also contribute to the development of anxiety and depression, leading to long-term consequences on an individual's mental health. Therefore, it is crucial to promote body positivity and refrain from making negative comments about someone's appearance.

Also, within EU you don't need the passport. I guess that the main reason for US citizens not having the passport is simply because the distance between US and other countries is far bigger than in Europe. For us is way cheaper to travel to north Africa, western Asia or eastern Europe or UK. You can usually travel for 200-300\u20ac to most of these regions, and with patience you can find the tickets even cheaper. I once traveled from Spain to Croatia for 20\u20ac\n\nProbably it's the same for Australia.",

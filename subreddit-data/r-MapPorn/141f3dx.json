People raised catholic as children may answer feeling connected to \"catholicism\" even though they previously answered that they were non-believers, agnostic or indifferent. Only 35% of respondents in total declared that they were \"believers\" (croyants).\n\nThe pie chart and percentages on the English Wikipedia page are misleading as they are presented, because the exact question is not explicitly mentioned.",

There are exaggerated displays of \"healing\" and \"devil removals\" on people, which makes it seem like it's all theater and that they are false prophets.\n\nAnd also the fact that evangelicals are the most politically intolerant group in the country. To them everything which doesn't conform to their views must be the devil's work. So people end up getting very annoyed by that, the evangelicals lack charisma.",

Of course it has its share of nutjobs, but most Catholics are not religious zealots, at least where I live (I hear in Poland Catholics are a serious threath). A lot of them don't even go to church. Their churches also are not loud and don't bother the neighborhood. \n\nEvangelicals on the other hand are a pain in the ass. They will go out of their way to push their god on you, their churches are loud as fuck, and most importantly they vote together in masse in far right politicians. They are really a problem with no solution. They make fucking lobbies in Congress to make sure the people they don't like don't get any rights. It's fucking disgusting.",

(Basically, they have been a swing vote in the past, sometimes voting Democrat, sometimes voting Republican. This makes national politicians focus more on issues important to Floridians than say New Yorkers or Utahns since those states are reliably Democrat and Republican, respectively.)\n\nSince winning the Cuban vote in Florida goes a long way to winning the state, and therefore the White House, lots of national politicians that otherwise have no reason to push to uphold the embargo wind up being politically forced into it, lest they torpedo potential presidential aspirations.\n\nOf note, President Obama significantly eased the embargo right before he left office. This was an easier political decision for him since he couldn't run for office again, but obviously handed some ammo to the Republican party to use against the Democrats in 2016. Unfortunately, Trump reversed a lot of the changes Obama put through.",

It cannot be. But this is not because of communists, marxists or any other flavor of \u2018ists. Just a fact of life. After 60 years absence, your school chums are not who you knew at all. Better now or worse than you remember? That\u2019s a value judgment made using today\u2019s lenses. Much like a telescope reaching back years because of light speed, what you actually see today in Cuba 2.0, is not what exists and may be warped by what todays generation was told about the past.\n\nBeing born and raised in Florida I have well over 60 years experience in observing the \u201cCuban Experience.\u201d It was reasonable early on - displaced people, bad men, property seized, etc. Fleeing injustice and oppression for freedom. Everything we were taught as children of the Greatest Generation to oppose. And then, Viet Nam.\n\nBoth groups (Vietnamese and Cubans) fled for the same reasons, basically. Both group exoduses started with the landed gentry and upper middle class who could afford to leave and had experience with Americans and America itself in some way. The Vietnamese refugees became different. They tried (or were forced by circumstances) to assimilate more than Cubans. They disbursed to larger areas and by that fact, diluted their own impact. In many ways this forced the next generations to adopt the new culture. Cubans, by in large, did not even attempt this.\n\nI returned to my notes from years back and found a May 25, 1975 NYT article: \u201cIt is true that the early Vietnamese arrivals, like the early Cuban arrivals, are middle class people with professional skills and some ability in English because of earlier associations with Americans,\u201d said Manuel Rodriguez Fleitas, a Cuban exile who helps direct the Cuban Refugee Program of the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d he hastened to add, \u201cthat is where the similarity ends. We Cubans came by the dozens over a period of 16 years, not by the tens of thousands over a period of less than 16 weeks.\n\n\u201cWe came to a country that many of us understood and had previously visited. We were able to settle in large groups so that we could maintain our culture, particularly here in Miami, where you can live in Cuban\u2010type weather in a \u2018Little Havana\u2019 and never speak anything but Spanish, never eat anything but Cuban food and never work for anybody but another Cuban.\u201d\n\nIt is possible that much of the Cuban 1.0 generation created and lived their internal and existential despair by choice. By looking back and longing for what was, and self isolating in Greater Miami and Tampa, they may have simply made a self fulfilling prophesy the \u201ctruth\u201d as they know it. There was no need to assimilate if you could simply move 90 miles and recreate Cuba 1.0 as Cuba 1.1?\n\nMy point is, doesn\u2019t the Cuban diaspora have Cuba now? There re 3 or 4 generations - Cuba 1.3? Isn\u2019t this iteration in the US \u201cTheir Cuba?\u201d What purpose would returning to the Motherland be? If the Cuba 1.0, 1.1 , 1.2 and 1.3 generations returned to today\u2019s Cuba 2.0, would they be happy? Or would they have to take another three generations to re-educate the \u201cnatives\u201d to drive out the evil? Wouldn\u2019t they have to reassimilate, again? And in doing so, would they be any better than the \u201cbad\u201d leaders of Cuba 2.0? I don\u2019t know. But they refuse to let the past go and refuse to let anyone in Florida and the US even try. It\u2019s a zero sum game. All communists must go and there is no compromise possible. And everything we lost, no matter what, must be returned to us.\n\nI could easily imagine wealthy Cubans returning, buying land and businesses, while maintaining the homestead in Miami and sending the kids to UM and UF. It could be a United Fruit, Cuban Telephone, and Standard Oil redux. This is a philosophical issue to debate (a debate that started earnestly after a 1964 Rand study by L. Johnson (U.S. Business Interests in Cuba and the Rise of Castro).\nhttps://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2008/P2923.pdf\n\nWe can (and have) debated this for years, but I would fear that all Cubans would be on the losing end as multiple generations rejigger the playing field politically, militarily, economically, mentally and educationally for years.\n\nI am not advocating surrender. I am trying to say that the issue is not the zero sum game that politically powerful Cuban 2.0s have advocated. Cuba 1.0 was not a well rounded society and had many severe systemic problems. Cuba 2.0 has all the hallmarks of the American social dysfunction we have today. Neither is what I would want to see in control. However I have never seen a plan to integrate the Cuban 1.x generations with Cuba 2.0. Rather it has appeared to be a \u201cthrow off the yoke of [insert here] and then we fix what\u2019s wrong.\u201d",

Back in 2016 you could go to Cuba on a cruiser, enter the island as an American tourist and even go to one of the hotel resorts. You could fly to any of the cities in Cuba, not just Havana, and if you were European, there was no risk of you being denied a visa for travelling to Cuba. Visas for Cubans were generally stable and Cuban Family Reunification Parole (CFRP) was present. Cubans abroad could send their families in the island  $1000 per month if necessary, and multiple foreign banks could be found in the island.\n\nUnder Trump all of these policies were taken away, along with an innumerable amount of other benefits our country benefited from. Only recently with the Biden administration were some of these measures reverted, or they promised to remove them in the near future. Regardless, we are no were near the levels of \"opening\" seen during the Cuban Thaw. We were reclassified a state sponsor of terrorism, Americans can't go to Cuba as tourists, international bank services are absent in Cuba, and most importantly, open hostility continues against our government. \n\nCuba is in a state of economic warfare with the United States, there might be cracks in what is a dome to shut off and suffocate the Cuban people but the fundamental laws which have prevented Cuba from functioning like a normal country in the international economy remain. Cuba is still deprived from all kinds of essentials that any third-world island country with limited productive forces needs for it not to fall to a humanitarian crisis and economic depression after its economic production kerplunks from it being denied access to oil, raw materials, and modern-day machinery and technology. \n\nThe pandemic has proven that the blockade is still firmly in place. Here I list a few examples from last year, when Cuba was in the peak of the pandemic:\n\nThe donation of masks and diagnostic kits from Chinese businessman, Jack Ma, founder of the Alibaba Group and the foundation that bears his name, did not reach Cuban territory because its carrier, a US company contracted to do so, declined its order at the last minute under the argument of the blockade's regulations. At the same time, it was impossible to buy pulmonary ventilators from the US company Vyaire Medical Inc.\n\nLikewise, the Swiss companies Imtmedical AG and Acutronic Medical Systems AG, world leaders in the development and manufacture of medical equipment and which had previously done business with Cuba, were acquired by Vyaire Medical Inc. and have been forced to suspend all commercial relations with the Cuba.\n\nSwiss banks, UBS, Bank Cler and Basler Kantonalbank refused to transfer donations made to Cuba by Swiss solidarity organizations MediCuba-Suisse and Asociaci\u00f3n Suiza-Cuba to support the country's work against SARS-CoV-2. These donations were intended to raise funds for the shipment of reagents, necessary for diagnostic tests, and protective equipment used in the fight against COVID-19.\n\nThe common supplier of blood bags, UNFAMED, informed that the company Terumo BCT of Japan was blocked from its bank account, since it must have an additional license that allows it to sell to Cuba products that are not produced in the United States, causing shortages.\n\nMEDICuba SA, a company that imports and exports medical products, contacted the seven companies that are part of its suppliers portfolio requesting to update the documentation to continue commercial relations. Only Eli Lilly issued a response, rejecting to continue as a supplier of MEDICuba, which has ratified this 2021.\n\nLikewise, more than 70 US companies were contacted by MEDICuba to inquire about the possibilities of importing medicines, equipment and other supplies needed by the National Health System. The vast majority did not react and three responded arguing that they could not establish commercial ties with Cuban entities due to the blockade.\n\nAmong the companies that did not respond to the request were:\n\nJansen, a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson, which was asked for Abiraterone Acetate, for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer. PFIZER was asked for Palbociclib, for the treatment of breast cancer, as well as Sunitinib for the treatment of renal carcinoma, and Crizotinib, for the treatment of lung cancer. \n\nIllumina technology, which allows sequencing the entire genome of a malignant tumor and defining molecular alterations related to specific treatments, and is also used for the molecular diagnosis of other diseases, was requested from Nanostrign Technologies.\n\nPembrolizumab (antibody) was requested from Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, lung cancer, bladder cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma and others. Golimumab was also requested, which is the most advanced biologic drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.",

The Cuban intervention in Angola is what you are actually thinking about, which is when the Cubans flooded Angola with tanks, planes and Cuban troops to combat a South African lead anti-communist insurgency which paradoxically lead to South Africa greatly scaling up its involvement in Angola. Cuba is definitely responsible for Angola having never fallen, but the communist regime was extremely brutal in the following years, which resulted in a horrific civil war later on.",

At the airport, they said \u2018we do not recognize your country\u2019 but then let her enter (this is the known standard interaction). Interestingly, the next room was a hall full of flags of the nations of the world, and included flags of both Israel and Palestine. We were there for 7 days all in Havana (no resorts) and spent lots of time talking to locals (the Israeli especially because she was the only one in our group who spoke Spanish). Encountered precisely zero hostility towards Israelis (though it could be influenced by the rest of us being Canadians, and Cubans have a very positive view of Canada). \n\nIf I had to guess, think the Israel vote in the UN has nothing to do with Cuban fighter jets in the October \u201873 war and has everyone to do with \u2018dance with the one that brung ya\u2019 i.e. the US is Israel\u2019s principal defender at the UN and so Israel votes with the US at the UN unless there is a really compelling reason for them not to.",

This is a really common UN misconception. The US has veto power over the security council. Only the security council.\n\nBut in a sense, they still do in this case, because the UNGA doesn't have any legal power. The US is under no obligation to lift the embargo because of this vote. The UN just recommended that the US do it. The article from the UN explains this correctly, quote:\n\n\"While the Assembly's vote carries political weight in terms of international diplomacy, only the US Congress can lift the economic, commercial, and financial embargo in place for five decades.\" [https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/06/1094612](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/06/1094612)\n\n*Every country ignores the UN when they disagree with it.* The UN is a diplomacy body, not a world government. The only body of the UN that doesn't get ignored is the security council (and the IMF I guess as well), because the rest of the UN has no legal power.",

But it's [2018, if you're wondering](https://www.reuters.com/article/cnews-us-usa-cuba-un-idCAKCN1N65UX-OCATP). (Not 2021 as some people have said - last year the abstentions were[ Colombia, Ukraine, and Brazil](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/06/1094612). \n\nThe UN has passed a resolution condemning the embargo *every single year since 1992* (except 2020 bc Covid). That's 29 times so far. There has never been more than 4 countries voting against it. The only countries to have ever voted with the US are Israel (every year), Marshall Islands (2000-07), Palau (2004-09, 2012), Brazil (2019), Uzbekistan (95-97), Paraguay (1993), Albania (1993) and Romania (1992). \n\nSo why does it still exist? There's not a good humanitarian argument for it. There's obviously not an (economic) left-wing argument for it. Right-wing economists generally agree that if you want to rope Cuba into capitalism, you try to get them trading with you (not prevent them from trading). It's basically just petty spitefulness because they're commies just off the coast of the US. \n\nAnd...because the popular political wisdom is that if you thaw relations with Cuba, you'll lose Florida. Is it true? Probably not nowadays.",

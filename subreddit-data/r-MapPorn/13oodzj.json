The cityscape depicted is actually only ~800m in length, with around 3000 inhabitants.\n\nBack then Oslo only consisted of a small settlement in what is now called \u00abOld Oslo\u00bb, the adjacent fortress called Akershus festning is visible at the top left in the picture.\n\nIn reality the distance between the fortress in the far distance and Old Oslo is only a 20 minute walk.",

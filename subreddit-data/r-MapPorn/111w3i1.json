So from the 161 MW power figure, we can easily calculate the total energy consumed.\n\nIf you want to get the total energy consumption of the Theater District in a year, you have to multiply the power by time. A year contains 8760 hours, so:\n\n161 MW \\* 8760 h = 1,410,360 MWh (megawatt-hours)\n\nOur inputs are way too imprecise for this level of accuracy, so we round that off to 1.41 TWh (terawatt hours; 1 TWh = 1,000,000 MWh)\n\nMegawatt hours are the typical unit used for electricity consumption. Though for the scale of your typical monthly household energy consumption, kilowatt-hours are more practical (1 MWh = 1,000 kWh).\n\nTL;DR: The annual electrical energy consumption of ~~Times Square~~ the Theater District is 1.41 terawatt-hours.",

That person is a billionaire, how do you prevent them being a billionaire without seizing the thing they've created from them?\n\nYes- that is a hypothetical, and no, most billionaires aren't like that. Yes they should all pay massively high rates of tax, and wealth taxes are probably correct for super wealthy people. No, the system won't change.\n\nEdit: maybe I should just have said that it's not the 'best' answer, probably just the best which is remotely achievable without a systematic overhaul.",

If we assume each flys about 1,000 hours a year, that\u2019s 30 million tons of CO2 per year. ^(([Edit: I looked through this 733 page EPA report and I was spot on, 30.9 in 2018 (page 150)](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-04/documents/us-ghg-inventory-2020-main-text.pdf#page150)\\)) Meanwhile, there is about 300 million tons of trash produced each year in the US, with a theoretical limit of about 1/3 being recyclable. It\u2019s hard to know how much CO2 that saves because there\u2019s a lot of different materials and steps involved, [but this site estimates about 1600lbs of CO2 per American,](https://changeit.app/blog/recycle-matters/) so about 265 million tons of CO2. That\u2019s about 9 times as much as the jets.\n\n\nSo yes, everyone recycling does also matter. It\u2019s even more important if we use world wide numbers. 23,000 private jets, and 2 billion pounds of garbage, is 46 million, and &gt;1 billion tons of CO2 respectively. Also, we should be making a push for more materials to be recyclable, further upping than number.\n\nMost Redditors seem to fall into this trap. This ultra wealthy do this thing 100,000 times as bad, so they must be most of the problem! They forgot that there\u2019s 1 million times as many non ultra wealthy people. Sure, the ultra wealthy are worse per capita and we should do something about it, but they typically aren\u2019t the highest total. For example, who do you think has ~8x as much money, the billionaires, or the millionaires? A lot of people don\u2019t realize it\u2019s the latter; they focus solely on billionaires when we should also be taxing millionaires more.",

On whatever transit you can scrape together it's an 11 or 12 hour journey. Terrible.\n\nLets say you flew your PJ. With decent traffic you're looking at 30ish min to the airport, plus 45 while you're there to get onboard and taxi out. About 90 minutes in the air, 70 if you go direct to John Wayne International. Another 30 to get off the plane, 20 to get to your car and another half hour (say 45 to an hour in bad traffic) to get to your mansion in Laguna Woods. That's 4-5 hours total travel time with good traffic, which lets be honest, is not a reality.\n\n-------------\n\nFrom Olympiciastadion in Berlin to central Munich it's about a 6 hour drive OR a 5.5 hour train ride. Basically the same amount of time to take a PJ from Phoenix to the LA 'burbs.\n\nIf you want the rich to stop taking PJs there needs to be a tangible reason for them to not take them. That's time. If it's the exact same (or less) amount of time to take high frequency, high speed transit, then EVERYONE will use it.",

                    "comment": "&gt;\tThe Democracy Index is an index measuring democracy compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit of the Economist Group, a UK-based private company which publishes the weekly newspaper The Economist. Akin to other democracy indices, such as V-Dem Democracy indices or Bertelsmann Transformation Index, this index attempts to measure the state of democracy and is centrally concerned with political institutions and freedoms. The index includes 167 countries and territories, of which 166 are sovereign states and 164 are UN member states. The index is based on 60 indicators grouped in five categories, measuring pluralism, civil liberties, and political culture. In addition to a numeric score and a ranking, the index categorizes each country into one of four regime types: full democracies, flawed democracies, hybrid regimes, and authoritarian regimes. The first Democracy Index report was published in 2006. Reports were published every two years until 2010 and annually thereafter.",

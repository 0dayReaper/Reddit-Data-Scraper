I once heard that some right-wing parties in the west will be considered leftist in India, but it's been a while so I don't remember where I heard it.\n\n\nAs a Levantine, I haven't met one person here who isn't extremely nationalistic. I know a guy who is a liberal and gets lib-center if we use the political compass, but is still one of the most nationalistic people I know.",

Even if, according to opinion polls, many Republican voters also support it, but the issue is portrayed as left of center. In Europe, it's as apolitical a subject as state funding for the military.",

It can have different flavors of socialism in the societal and cultural realm but socialism none the less.\n\nA fun experiment is to open up the manifestos of the BJP(so called right wing party) and the Communist party of India, side by side and guess which manifesto belongs to which party. Because they pretty much overlap on most points.",

That includes communists, socialists and social democrats. \n\nIf this map gets a lot of attention, then I will be doing another such map on fascist/neo-nazi/extreme right-wing seats.",

They have never been in government in the Republic, because for a long time they did not recognise the D\u00e1il (Irish parliament) as legitimate, because Northern Ireland is still under British control.\n\nIt should noted that all three major Irish political parties were at some point tied to the IRA. Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il were up until 1921 the same party (original Sinn F\u00e9in) but split over the peace deal with Britain during the war of independence. Both parties are mostly neo-liberal, centre-right (kind of like two flavours of the German CDU). Modern Sinn F\u00e9in came out of Northern Ireland and were the political wing of the Provisional IRA. Terrorist links have faded since. But they lean into socialist populism.\n\nThere are more uncomplicated definitively left-wing parties in Ireland, but they are much smaller and are divided, the Green Party, Labour, the Social Democrats and Solidarity-People before Profit are all left wing parties with different angles, greens are environment, labour are trade unions, etc. The greens and labour have both been minor coalition members of government, though. \n\nTLDR; No left-wing party has ever led an irish government, and the closest to being in a position to do so are basically the most viable anti-establishment option.",

When i say right-wing, I mean *anything* to the right of centre.\n\nWhen you say \"actual right wing\" you mean far right.\n\nConsider [this](https://imgur.com/eAKBq9M) very shitty MS paint diagram.\n\nConsider also: if you went to a hotel and the reception told you that your room was in the left wing of the hotel, you wouldn't assume it meant the extreme end of the left wing -- no, just the entire left wing of the bulding. So you'd ask her to clarify what part of the left wing.\n\nI do agree with what you're saying in terms of *content* though. You just have a somewhat unusual set of definitions.",

They are quite obviously not at the extreme right of Germany's political spectrum, that's clearly where the AfD and various small outright right-wing extremist parties sit. I keep forgetting what the NPD call themselves these days, but you know who I mean. Although the AfD would probably dispute that and claim to be a 'b\u00fcrgerliche' party, which a lot of the more fringe parties probably wouldn't even claim. But CDU and CSU are also certainly not partys of the centre. They certainly cover quite a bit of the political spectrum, and some parts are undoubtedly more centrists. Which is also true for the SPD, by the way. I'd say there's quite a bit of overlap between the right wing of the SPD and the left wing pf the CDU. But there can be no doubt that CDU and CSU also have a right wing which is quite a bit removed from the centre. They are obviously not fascist, but they are also not centrist. Calling S\u00f6der a centrist, for example, would be more than just a stretch. And let's not forget that Alexander Gauland used to be a CDU politician, as was Erika Steinbach. And Hans-Georg Maa\u00dfen is still a CDU member (although admittedly they are working hard on rectifying that). Not saying these people are in any way representative of the CDU,  but there can't really be any doubt that the CDU also covers quite a bit of the right spectrum (even if extreme right positions are outliers, and have mostly left for the AfD anyway)",

Although the EU does have requirements for new member states joining, it has no hard mechanisms to correct authoritarian tendencies -- including fascism. One notable example is *Golden Dawn*. They were banned recently, but only by virtue of the Greek government. The EU has little to do with it. And although Golden Dawn has been stripped of its seats, it is still an active underground political party. The *de facto* ideology of *Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland* has also been called into question.",

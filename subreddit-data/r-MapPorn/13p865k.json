If not a little pink. \n\nBut, as far as the groceries people are buying, I guess this is fairly accurate. Coles and Woolworths are by far the most popular grocery stores, and european-esque food is the most available food. \n\nLarge Asian Grocers are becoming more popular and Asian-style groceries (veges, spices, Asian branded sauces ect) are also becoming more available in common supermarkets, so I would think this data would slowly be changing to more SE Asian in the coming decades.",

Personally, in my opinion, the cuisine of Russia and Ukraine is very similar (I would say that the similarity is 99%), if we do not take into account the cuisine of the indigenous peoples inhabiting Siberia, Altai, Chukotka and Kamchatka. This is due to a common culture and a long existence as one state.\n\nEverywhere people love meat, bread, vegetables, fish, fruits. In some places, the kitchen may contain dishes from local cuisine (horse meat sausage in Tatarstan, koumiss in Kalmykia, bear meat dumplings in Siberia, seal meat dishes in Kamchatka or Chukotka), etc. But these are unusual dishes that not even all locals eat.\n\nWhy did I write a sarcastic message? One Briton here tried to take me into account how to speak Russian correctly. For some reason, he believed that he knew Russian better than a person for whom this language is native. I also often see foreigners trying to prove to me or other Russians that we don't know our country well. At first it was insulting and annoying. Then it started to cause laughter.\n\nI just can't imagine a situation where I will convince a resident of some country that I know his country better than he (she) does.",

If some British wanker wants to school you on Russian language nuances - that makes him a dickhead - not me. \n\nOf course Russian food and Ukrainian food (and many eastern Slavic peoples) is so similar. My point being, that I could see how the Russian cuisine would be more aligned to the Australian cuisine than Ukrainian cuisine - whilst still being much much much more similar to Ukrainian overall. The map isn\u2019t saying Russian food is *more Australian like* than it is other foods - just that comparatively there may be more similarities *in australia* to Russia than say Ukraine. I don\u2019t think neither Russia nor Ukraine would have an actual national cuisine as similar as each others at all. \n\nI say this as an Australian-born Russian. I have been to Russia many, many times. My parents and grandparents come from Russia. I cook - lot of  russian foods regularly, and have also been to Ukraine a couple of times.\n\nVareniki for example have no known counterpart here. People are not familiar with them. But pelmeni are very common here. Not always known necessarily as *pelmeni* (though sometimes they are) - but many people love meat dumplings. Certain fish - be it salmon, herring, etc are all available (and various levels of popularity) and of course the standard meat and vegetables. You mention Siberia - Pozi (which I love and make as my Deda was from Ulan Ude) are similar to foods available here from nearby cultures. So again food that is \u201cRussian\u201d would be more identifiable to the typical Australian - if you know what I mean. \n\nAgain, I wasn\u2019t trying to be an Anglo explaining to a Russian how to Russian. I was an Anglo with significant exposure to Russian culture, language, religion and cuisine - and exposure to Australian cuisine - making a comment to no one in particular! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nHave a great day",

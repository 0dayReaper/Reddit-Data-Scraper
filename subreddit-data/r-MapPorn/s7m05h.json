Coloured people (not derogitory just the name given to mixed race people here in Namibia/South Africa) tend to speak primarily Afrikaans as a first lanaguage and English as a second language. Black people speak their native language depending on their tribe (e.g. Ovambo, Herero, Damara) and English and most likely also speak Afrikaans.",

I did it and it was great. Controversial but when I went to the Netherlands, it was very helpful to know German, when I learned Dutch because the way the grammar works is quite similar, e.g. ik ben vs ich bin, er sie es ist vs hij zij het is, etc. My Afrikaans didn't help me AT ALL in the Netherlands in terms of speaking. I could read the train signs though, that was helpful.\nI was in Windhoek in Namibia and the 3 languages there are Afrikaans, German and English. It was such an interesting experience, shopping for kekse (cookies) in what felt like an Afrikaans/South African shop!",

Because West-Flemish is closer to it's midieval root than any other Dutch dialect, by some it is even considered as a seperate language.",

Like, really unpleasant and angrily correcting my grammar, never come across anything like that before.\n\nI called my Danish friend who I just said goodbye to and he came back over and talked to the woman, no idea what they said back then, think I just recognised 'storbritannien'. She immediately was smiling and laughing as if it was all one big misunderstanding.\n\n&gt;So sorry, I thought you were an immigrant\n\nThat derailed but yeah, I speak Danish semi-fluently but with a somewhat rare English accent, and everyone under the age of 40 just speaks to me in English, proving my waste of time learning lol",

Nowadays she can only really speak in it at a basic level, because she never regularly speaks it anymore.",

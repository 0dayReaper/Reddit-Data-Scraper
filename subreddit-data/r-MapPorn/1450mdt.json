If Climate Change is an emergency as Obama said and we cannot have our air on 72 anymore or drive your SUV then Obama has several choices\n\n1.  He can choose not to make any unnecessary travel while president because it requires TWO giant 747s and not to mention the dozens of cars and other climate polluting vehicles. \n\n2. He can choose to not be President anymore so he can travel commercial to Hawaii\n\n3. He can choose to spend his vacation at Camp David.  A short helicopter ride away.  Or at a local beach resort near DC.  \n\nBut since he chose to fly those two giant 747s to Hawaii and everything that came with it Im going to assume he doesnt really think its an \"emergency\"",

It shows how complicated people are as individuals and how difficult it is to effect, real structural change.\n\nDemocratic presidents have tried to lead by example on the climate issue, but they get punished by voters and the GOP. Jimmy Carter put up solar panels on the White House, and Reagan went and took them down out of spite. Which political party do you think is actually serious about climate change and not just owning their opponents? Get a grip.",

Basically someone who barely at all emits any carbon, but who is probably feeling the direct effects of climate change because of heat waves/droughts/flooding/whatever.\n\nNow they see a westerner, who says they are helping the environment by using paper straws, or by turning the air conditioning down a bit, or flying commercial instead of private to their overseas vacation.\n\nThat person is going to look at all of that and say the same thing you're saying about Larry David's wife. They would call us all hypocrites and yell that not doing nearly enough. And they do in fact do this at international conferences and meetings. And they are right.\n\nAnd that's the entire problem with the finger-pointing here. It's totally counterproductive and ignores everyone's own personal contributions to the problem.",

Idk just had to vent bc it's just insane how we continue to treat this Earth with all that we know. Corporate America and my \"locality\" America act like climate change is not real. It really, really sucks to witness.\n\nIs it very different in Europe than this?

In a 1 hour trip at 60 mph, the car travels 60 miles, burns 2 gallons, and emits 40 lbs of CO2 total, or .666 lbs of CO2 per person-mile.\n\nThe 76-seat jet I fly will burn roughly 600 gallons per *hour* enroute, and travel around 500 miles in 1 hour of still air (so about 0.83 MPG).  With jet fuel yielding around 21 pounds of CO2 per gallon, that's a total of 12,600 lbs for the journey and 25.2 lbs per mile total, translating to .33 pounds per person-mile.\n\nSo yes, assuming a full flight and equal distances (along highway for the car, in cruise flight for the jet), aviation can be at double the carbon-efficiency of the average economy car until you add multiple passengers in the car.  Newer and larger jets like the A220 or A330neo should see even better efficiencies.\n\n\nEdit: some additional factors... jet engines burn through lubricating oil way faster than a gas car engine.  Aviation must also account for APU fuel usage (usually 45 minutes per flight segment at 10-30 gallons per hour) and the impact of additional systems that contribute to carbon emissions through use and maintenance (ground service vehicles, hydraulics, oxygen service, fire extinguishing agents, etc)",

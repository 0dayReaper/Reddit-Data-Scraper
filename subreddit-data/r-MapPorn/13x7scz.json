            "comment": "Most maps of Pre-Columbian North America that I've seen are by cultural region rather than language, and the ones that are tend to show where groups were when they encountered Europeans, NOT where they were in 1492 (for instance, the Comanche are almost always shown on the Southern Plains, even though they didn't come to the Southern Plains until they got the horse and probably didn't exist as a separate ethnicity from the Eastern Shoshone at all in 1492).    The specifics involve a lot of guesswork, but we know that Europeans caused a cascade of migration inland when they started contacting coastal peoples, and some groups had been displaced for a couple hundred years by the time they actually made direct contact with Europeans.\n\nThis Wikipedia map, from a 1960s textbook, was my starting point, but it follows the \"where they were when Europeans arrived to that specific area\" model, plus some of the language classifcations are outdated:  [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Early\\_Localization\\_Native\\_Americans\\_USA.jpg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Early_Localization_Native_Americans_USA.jpg)\n\nFor the current-day map, I used the map in this report from the US Census: [https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2011/acs/acsbr10-10.pdf](https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2011/acs/acsbr10-10.pdf)\n\nNotes on methodology: For the pre-contact map, I took a generally \"lumping\" approach to language families, mostly to make the map easier to read--if there's reasonable consensus that two langauges belong to the same family, I put them together (e.g. \"Hokan,\" which definitely includes the Yuman families of western Arizona but might not include the Californian languages).  To reflect the uncertainty about precise locations, especially in the interior, I blurred the lines, but even with that this map presents things as more certain than they actually are.  There are almost certainly some individual isolates and whole groups that just went extinct without ever being recorded.  Furthermore, some territories weren't really \"inhabited\" in any meaningful sense; others were shared hunting grounds; others were being actively fought over.  Because of all that uncertainty, this map can't be said to represent a particular moment in time, but is an impressionistic view of where native languages were spoken in the 16th century.For the modern map, I mostly approximated the shape of the reservations where these languages are mostly spoken, but it's important to note that many reservations don't have a lot of original speakers of the language, and conversely that (especially near large reservations) the language is also spoken outside the reservation.  There are also a couple urban areas where Native languages are spoken in considerable number: Anchorage, Fairbanks, Honolulu, Sea-Tac, Los Angeles, Tulsa, and Minneapolis (but not New York City!)Note that this is not indicating areas where a majority of people in the area speak the Native language it (that would reduce it to a couple areas in Alaska, and maybe the Pueblos and the Navajo Nation) or even a plurality (which would only slightly expand it) but anywhere more than 500 people speak it in one place.  Nor does this indicate where it' the \\*only\\* language spoken (maybe Niihau, maybe some particularly remote spots on the Navajo Nation) or even the \\*primary\\* language (which would add bits of southwest and interior Alaska, some of the pueblos, and more of the Navajo Nation)--just that it's spoken at all.",

            "comment": "Notes on Content:   \nNa-Dene:   \nTHEN:  Northern Athabaskan in the Alaskan interior; Eyak and Tlingit in Southeast Alaska; California Athabaskan in northern California and Southern Oregon; Navajo in and around the Four Corners; Apachean on the Southern Plains and into the desert southwest.  Note that pinning down the location of Southern Athabaskans is tricky; they almost certainly migrated from the Alaska/Canada borderlands in the 1100s but other than that it's a moving target because they left such a light archaeological trace.  Navajo, who probably migrated over the Rockies crest, were probably in the Four Corners by 1492; the Apache are less certain.  The Na-Dene patches in the Central Plains represent the \"Dismal River aspect,\" an archaeological culture associated with people who were almost certainly ancestral to the Jicarilla Apache, which dates to the mid-16th century but with indicates that they'd been there for a while.  It's also not clear they'd gotten all the way into the Southwest; they may not have been there until the Comanches displaced them in the 18th century.  But the Comanche may have just reduced their territory than pushign them into new areas.  IN general the patchy Apachean presence on the Central Plains is intended to indicate a migration that was maybe still in progress.   \nNOW: Navajo is by far the most commonly spoken indigenous language and the borders of the Navajo Nation approximate (and maybe even go beyond) the traditional boundaries of Dinetah.  Apachean languages are spoken on several reservations in New Mexico and Arizona, and one in Oklahoma.  All Californian Athabaskan languages are extinct or nearly so.  In the Alaskan interior, Northern Athabaskan languages are still spoken in many small villages and there is a sizeable Athabaskan-speaking population in Fairbanks.  Eyak is basically extinct; Tlingit is highly endangered but undergoing active revitalization efforts.\r  \nEskaleut:  \nTHEN: Inupiat on the northern coast of Alaska, Yup'ik on the west and southwest coast, Sugpiaq (Alutiiq) in the Kodiak Archipelago and along Prince William Sound, Unangax on the outer Alaska Peninsula and in the Aleutian Islands  \nNOW: Yup'ik is very widely spoken in southwestern Alaska and the other languages are still extant, but less common, in their traditional territories.  There is also a significant Yup'ik-speaking population in Anchorage  \nSalishan:   \nTHEN: Coast Salish along the shores of the Salish Sea and across most of the Olympic Peninsula; Tillamook, a southern outlier on the Oregon Coast; Interior Salishan on parts of the Columbia Plateau (Columbia, Okaganagan) and into the Rockies in Idaho (Coeur d'Alene) and Montana (Selish/\"Flathead\")  \nNOW: Thanks to the Puyallup Reservation, America's only truly urban reservation, in Tacoma, a sizeable Lustosheed (a Coast Salish language) population can be found in and around Sea-Tac, plus the Flathead Reservation in western Montana.  \n\r  \nPenutian:  \nTHEN: A variety of languages spoken in California's Central Valley (touching the coast at San Francisco Bay with Miwok) and parts north (Modoc), the southern Columbia Plateau/Spokane Plains (Sahaptin, Nez Perce).  \nNOW: Sahaptin and related langauges on the Yakama Reservation in Washington.  Tsimshian might be Penutian and is now spoken on the Metlakatla Reservation in Southest Alaska, but was (probably) only spoken in Canada in prehistoric times.  \n\rUto-Aztecan:  \nTHEN: A widely spoken language group in the Great Basin (Ute, Paiute) with eastern extensions probably cresting the Rockies and touching the Eastern Plains (Shoshone, Comanchi), as well as in the Hopi Pueblo and parts of Arizona (O'Odham)---and, as the name implies, in Mexico.  The Jumano people of the lower Rio Grande Valley, who were displaced by the Apache and Comanche, may have been Uto-Aztecan--or may have spoken an unrelated language group, or may not even have been a coherent linguistic grouping.    \nNOW: Hopi still spoken on the Hopi Pueblo; the two O'Odham languages still well-attested on their two reservations in Arizona.  Ute on several reservations in Utah and one in Colorado.    \nYuman: A couple languages in Southern California  \nHokan:   \nTHEN: The Yuman branch was spoken along the Lower Colorado River (Yavapai, Yavasupai) and into Southern California, including Baja California (Kumeyaay/\"Diegueno\"); possibly related to languages in Northern California (Shastan, Pomoan).  \nNOW: Spoken on the Yavapai Reservation in Arizona plus small populations in San Diego County (and in Baja California); all northern branches are extinct or critically endangered.  \nKeresan  \nTHEN AND NOW: Either one Puebloan language with two dialects, or two Puebloan languages, spoken in the Rio Grande Valley and parts west of there\r  \nTanoan:   \nTHEN: Three closely-related Puebloan languages, plus Kiowa. The Kiowa are known to history as a small but formidable Plains group, but do not appear to have reached the Plains until the post-contact era.  Their tribal lore puts them in the Yellowstone Valley prior to entering the Black Hills of South Dakota, so that's where I put them on the map.  \nNOW: The Puebloan languages are still spoken in most of their traditional territories, although they were pushed off their southernmost pueblo by Apaches; Kiowa on the Kiowa Reservation in Oklahoma.  \nSiouan:   \nTHEN:  I hold with the theory that Siouan-speakers, in particuarly the Osage (whose tribal lore says so) were the children of Cahokia, who for reasons unknown abandoned Cahokia and started migrating outwards along the major rivers.  They seem to have gotten the furthest up the Missouri (Absaroka/\"Crow\", Hidatsa, Mandan) with a southern group going along the Arkansas and Platte (Kansa, Osage, Quapaw) and the Sioux Proper (Lakota/Dakota/Nakota, the \"Seven Council Fires\") and Ho-Chunk (Winnebago) in the Big Woods region.  I also have Siouan-speakers still in the vicinity of the American Bottom, in the Ohio up to the Falls of the Ohio and the Wabash up to Terre Haute, indicating that the departure from Cahokia was perhaps still in progress in 1492.  One large eastern outlier, Catawban, east of the Appalachians; and a possible small southern outlier, Biloxi, on the Gulf Coast.  \nNOW: Sioux Proper spoken in a variety of reservations in South Dakota; everything else is extinct or critically endangered  \nAlgic:  \nTHEN: The only really continent-spanning language group, with one western outlier in the Alberta/Montana borderlands (Niitsitapi/\"Blackfoot\") plus two extreme and distantly-related outliers in northern California.  The main body ranged from the Red River Valley (Arapaho and Cheyenne, who may have been a single group in 1491) and western Great Lakes (Menomini, Ojibwe) through the Midwest (Potawotami, Meskwaki, Sauk, Kickapoo, Shawnee, Miami, Illini) and down the East Coast from Maine (actually, New Brunswick) to the Outer Banks of North Carolina (Passamaquoddy, Massachusett, Narragansett, Mohican, Mohegan, Pequot, Lenape/\"Delaware\", Nanticoke, Powhatan).  \nNOW: Passamaquoddy on a small reservation in Maine; Ojibwe on several reservations in northern Minnesota, plus a sizeable community in Minneapolis; Niitsitapi on the Blackfeet Reservation in Montana; Arapho on the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming; Crow on the Crow Reservation in Montana; Meskwaki in the Meskwaki Indian Community (not a reservation) in Iowa.  \nIroquoian:  \nTHEN: Haudenosaunee or Iroquois Proper, spoken in the famous Five Nations in the Eastern Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Valley; Susquehannock in the Susquehanna Valley; Tuscarora in the Carolina uplands; Cherokee in the Southern Appalachians  \nNOW: Seneca and Mohawk on two smallish reservations in New York; Cherokee widely spoken on the Cherokee Reservation in Oklahoma plus a small remnant community in western North Carolina  \nMuskogean:  \nTHEN: Spoken broadly across the Southeast from the Missisippi (Muscogee proper/\"Creek\") to the Gulf Coast (Apalachee)  \nNOW: Mostly spoken on the Muscogee, Chickasaw, Chocktaw, and Seminole Reservations in Oklahoma, with one remnant Chocktaw population in Alabama  \nZuni:  \nTHEN AND NOW: A language isolate spoken only at the Zuni Pueblo  \nAustronesian:  \nTHEN: Hawaiian was the only language spoken in the Hawaiian Islands until European arrival in the 18th century  \nNOW: Hawaiian is a minority language and somewhat endangered but still well-attested across the islands  \nEvery other language family on the first map is extinct or nearly so.",

            "comment": "Just as an FYI:\n\na) these are all language families, most representing a bunch of languages each. Under say Siouan, we already have Dakota, Lakota, Crow, Catawba and more.\n\nb) this map does conble a lot of distributions from many different time periods so do take the colouring at a grain of salt. Siouan is especially telling since many of their ranges in this map was not reached until after European contact and I remeber hearing the same for the Comanche.\n\nc) some of these groupings are\u2026 controversial to say the least. I think the biggest ones are Hokan and Penutian both are which aren\u2019t widely accepted and are divided into lang more smaller families. Some of the colouring is also a bit debetable esp in the Southeast due to a lack of documentation of many of the languages there\n\nd) There should be a splotch of Chimakuan in Eastern Olympic Peninsua in the first map where Chemakum was spoken. The current map only shows the location of Quileute",

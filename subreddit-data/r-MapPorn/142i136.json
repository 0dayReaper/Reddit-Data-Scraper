            "comment": "The assault began shortly after midnight on June 6, 1944, with an air bombardment consisting of more than 2,200 allied bombers attacking targets along the coast and inland.  Clouds hindered the air strikes, however, and the coastal bombing at Omaha Beach was particularly ineffective.  More than 24,000 American, British, and Canadian airborne assault troops and 1,200 aircraft followed the air bombardment.  At 1:30 a.m. the 101st (U.S.) Airborne Division began landing behind Utah beach to secure the exits from the beach, and the 82d (U.S.) Airborne Division began landing at 2:30 a.m. to secure bridges on the right flank of the beachhead.  Thick cloud cover also hindered the air insertion, and many of the units missed their landing zones, often by miles.  On the coastline, the second phase began at 5:30 a.m. as forces when six Allied divisions and numerous small units began landing on five beaches.  The Allies landed more than 160,000 troops at Normandy, of which 73,000 were American.  There were also 83,115 British and Canadian forces who landed on Gold, Juno, and Sword beaches.\n\nBy the end of the first day, none of the assault forces had secured their first-day objectives.  Allied casualties on June 6 have been estimated at 10,000 killed, wounded, and missing in action: 6,603 Americans, 2,700 British, and 946 Canadians.  Over the following days the Allies gradually expanded their tenuous foothold.  When a failed German counterattack on August 8 resulted in more than 50,000 German troops being encircled by Allied forces near the town of Falaise, the tide turned, and the Allies broke out of Normandy on August 15.  Once out of Normandy, Allied forces advanced quickly and liberated Paris on August 25.  German forces retreated across the Seine five days later, marking the end of Operation Overlord.\n\n[source](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/06/06/fact-sheet-normandy-landings)",

Large flat beach with no where to take cover, leading to hilly bluffs full of German fortifications. \n\nI tried to google an actual answer and it\u2019s complex. The British and Canadians landed veteran forces with experienced leadership. They designed specialized beach assault tanks to help clear the beach. The Americans decided to only utilize the DD tank, an amphibious tank that could be launched in the water and make it to shore. These tanks were meant to land with the initial waves to help clear the beach. Due to rough seas at Omaha the commander in charge launched them too far from shore and most of them sank, leaving Omaha with no early armor support. The bombers assigned to Omaha basically completely missed their mark and insufficient naval barrage left German defenses at Omaha largely intact. German forces at omaha included a veteran infantry division which wasn\u2019t the case at every beach.\n\nUtah beach in comparison had some lower flying bombers that hit their targets and they managed to land most of their tanks in the initial waves. The current pushed the first wave a mile off their landing target, which ended up being less defended than their planned landing site. The commanders in the initial waves directed subsequent troops to the new site and they were able to secure the beach and push inland with light resistance",

France has always struggled in part to come to terms with accepting or having to have some 'respect' for Britain for what its troops did during that time period. \n\nDe Gaulle even refused to attend any D-Day memorials during his time as president of France.\n\nIt's quite common to see French people online downplaying Britains role in the war or insulting their war effort. It's just a reaction to them trying to cope with what they view as the embarrassment from having their nation fall in such circumstances and the shame of Vichy collaboration. Like I said DeGaulle did a lot to try and rehabilitate their image internally away from Vichy regime etc and more onto the resistance.",

French people visit London all the time and love it. Brits come to Paris on romantic weekends and take their kids to Disney or go skiing on the french alps.\n\nAnd more importantly, I don't know one french person who doesn't recognise that they got their ass kicked in WW2 and were saved by the conjoint effort of the brits, canadians, americans, and russians. There's a ton of memorial places in Normandy for the fallen in WW2 from all the involved countries. Look at parisian metro stations: there's Franklin Roosevelt, Stalingrad,... In Bayeux they have a huge monument honoring the brits that landed on D-Day.\n\nThere's rivalry but nothing like the hate between other european countries that have been at war in the past (Turkey - Greece, Armenia - Azerbaidjan, etc.).",

So France should not be especially ashamed; the Germans made asses out of every army it faced.\n\nAnd what we should also recall that in WW I, it was the French who were most responsible for defeating Germany. Not to diss the contributions of the others (especially the Brits and Canadians), but the French fought with determination and skill and paid dearly for the win. Thank goodness for them!",

I think it was also a large number of American troops who were garrisoned in France post-war.\n\nAlso like, you go to Omaha Memorial, the only difference between American and French stuff are the insignas. You go to Utah there are little open air museum with trucks and jeeps. There's a Sherman tank as a monument in the center of my town. I think it matters on how it make people remember things.\n\nAs an aside, to mention De Gaulle since the other dude's obsessing on it, he was still absolutely pissed off 20 years ago about not being told about the plans of Overlord or how the US had planned a temporary American government over France led by Eisenhauer that he never went to a D-Day Memorial. But it was pretty much a De Gaulle thing, the begging and bargaining following presidents and their aides did to try to mellow him could make a sitcom",

All along the coast, remnants of the Atlantic Wall remain. Every village has at least a monument devoted to the liberators in a seafront sqare. American, British and Canadian flags are everywhere, part of the landscape. Allied cemeteries and museums are also legion. Not to mention our broader cities such as Caen and Le Havre that were literally annihilated by bombing.\n\n80 years after the war still lives and breathes in us, so it's impossible to live in ignorance of it.\n\nEven though this memory is surely less vivid for French people living elswhere, it seems clear to me that school programs place particular emphasis on WWII. The role of the Allies is explained, as much as possible, in a historically rigorous way.",

The Canadian First Army took heavy casualties initially after weather made coordinated landing difficult, but they were ultimately able to clear out the German shore defences in 2 hours.    \n\nThat quote in the post above incorrectly says none of the D-Day assault forces achieved their first-day objectives, but The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada did succeed in their objective of establishing a beachhead and pushing it 7 miles inland and taking Big Two Hill.  This is from a memoir by Lieutenant P.R. Rae, who was there:\n\n[Link](https://qormuseum.org/history/timeline-1925-1949/the-second-world-war/d-day-pr-rae/)\n\n*A sunken road led into the next village, Basly, and we were very happy to duck into it; losing the \u2018shooting gallery\u2019 target feeling that had been ours while racing across the open ridge. With better coverage we kept moving forward toward our objective. The Carrier Platoon occupied a height of land \u2013 our destination for this first day. This slight prominence became known to us as Big Two Hill. Battalion Headquarters paused beside the brick walls until the tanks came back. Then we moved into a small orchard on the edge of the village. The Queen\u2019s Own Rifles of Canada had reached its D-Day objective and a defensive perimeter to hold it had been established.*\n\nThe Third Canadian Infantry also succeeded in pushing further inland than any of the other D-Day forces managed to.",

The only similarity is a dam getting busted. Its natural in that case that people are going to feel differently. \n\n\nOperation Chastise was launched against a power (Germany) that was occupying most of Europe for the purpose of inhibiting its industrial capacity. \n\nRussia is currently occupying a large portion of Ukraine and if they destroyed the dam, they did so for no reason other than terror and destruction. They messed up their own defensive lines doing it, so you can hardly say its for a military purpose. \n\nSo in one case you have a daring strike against an aggressive occupying power and in the most recent case you have an act *by* an aggressive occupying power.

In the years since WWII ended, Americans have managed to convince themselves that they won the war themselves, and that Operation Overlord was an impossible mission against an invincible enemy with the men storming the beaches facing near-certain death, rather than an operation explicitly intended to rapidly overwhelm a weak defensive point on the neglected Western front against an enemy that had already lost *millions* of soldiers thousands of kilometers away.",

The five beaches are codenamed Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword. \n\n1. **Utah Beach:** This was the westernmost landing site and was tasked to the U.S. 4th Infantry Division. Utah was added to the invasion plans at the request of General Eisenhower to secure a beachhead on the Cotentin Peninsula to facilitate the capture of Cherbourg. The invasion on Utah Beach was successful with fewer than 300 casualties.\n\n2. **Omaha Beach:** This was the most heavily fortified beach, defended by the experienced German 352nd Infantry Division. The U.S. 1st and 29th Infantry Divisions faced strong resistance, and it became the deadliest landing site, with about 2,000 U.S. casualties. \n\n3. **Gold Beach:** This was in the center of the five beaches and was assigned to the British 50th Infantry Division. They were tasked with linking up with the Americans from Omaha Beach to the west and Canadians at Juno to the east. The invasion was successful, with the troops securing the beach and pushing further inland.\n\n4. **Juno Beach:** The 3rd Canadian Infantry Division landed here. Despite facing heavy resistance and dealing with obstacles on the beach, the Canadians were able to secure the beach and push further inland, although they faced over 1,000 casualties.\n\n5. **Sword Beach:** This was the easternmost landing site and was tasked to the British 3rd Infantry Division. They were also tasked with linking up with airborne troops who had landed earlier inland. They faced resistance at strongpoints along the beach but were able to secure it.\n\nEach of the landings played a crucial role in weakening the German Atlantic Wall and was a significant step towards the liberation of France and Europe in World War II.\n\n~ I, Joshua",

The Soviets would've been using horses (like the Germans had to) across the vast expanse of Eastern Europe during Barbarossa, and the British would've starved without us. \n\nThe US Navy was not decimated, not even close. Many of the ships sunk at Pearl Harbor were refloated shortly afterwards, and not a single aircraft carrier was even damaged during the attack. The Japanese themselves knew the attack was a strategic failure. \n\nAnd hmmm, I wonder why the Americans were so hesitant to get involved, was there perhaps a European debacle we got dragged into about I dunno 20 years before WW2, where we were lied to intervene in a pointless war? Ring any bells?",

Because it's really cringey, and you're just backtracking on things you said earlier while acting like I misinterpreted them. You said the Japanese sailed right into America's backyard and \"roflstomped\" us. That is just painfully untrue, the US Pacific Fleet was able to sink 4 Japanese carriers months later, our carriers were not even touched at Pearl Harbor, and calling Hawaii our backyard is ridiculous. \n\nYes everyone still used horses, but without American trucks (go ahead and google how many we gave the USSR) they would've needed to use many more. \n\nAlso the Blitz(google it, I'm sure you have no idea what that means) did not do much damage to British factories, they initially targeted airfields, and then they targeted civilian city centers to attempt to demoralize them. It's really like you have no fucking clue what you're talking about.",

The Dieppe Raid showed that coastal cities are heavily defended and even if the Allies manage to capture them, Germans will sabotage harbour infastructure.\n\nThat's why they decided to build two artificial harbours (called [Mulberry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulberry_harbour)) on the beaches. Cherbourg was besieged and surrendered later.\n\nEDIT: Also the first action of the invasion was the [attack on the bridges near Ranville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_the_Caen_canal_and_Orne_river_bridges) (on this map marked as \"Pegasus Bridge\") and it's purpose was exactly what you are saying - to prevent the German counterattack from the east.",

The Germans were expecting the main assault to land near Calais.",

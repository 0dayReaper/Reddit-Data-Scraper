Spanish is also behind French (9,130, not counting people who listed French plus another language), Italian (7,765) and about tied with German (5,270). \n\nAh, I've realized the discrepancy: the Mexican consulate is located there because of thousands of temporary farm workers who come in during the harvest season. Since they aren't residents of Canada I assume they wouldn't show up on the census. Given how many Arabic speakers are though I'm not even sure of counting all the temporary workers would put Spanish ahead.",

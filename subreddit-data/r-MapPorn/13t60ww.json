The curonian spit is more like a giant sand dune with a lagoon on one side. Something similar would be the lagoon of Venice and the Lido of Venice.  \n\nIf you want to know what the Dutch coast would be like with much less human intervention, look at the wadden sea and the North Frisian islands in Germany.",

Ethnic cleansing is not an ethical think to do. It's like you oppose Russia and the same time supporting what they do in Ukraine. With same logic we should send Turks in the red apple tree. Because some day in the past Kaliningrad was under different kingdom doesn't mean that it is and today. So Russians are doing good to retake Crimea since they took Control of Crimea from Turks? Or wait maybe give it Turks then, or wait maybe give to Greeks then. You see my point right?",

Sardinia of Italy? Or the countless other examples where countries have islands or territories outside the mainland.\n\nIt's nothing special, it's nothing new, you're just trying to sound smart but you're coming off like a jackass. There's nothing technical about any of that shit.\n\nNot an anomaly in any shape or form. Most countries have some sort island or territory not connected to mainland.\n\nIf you really wanted an anomaly and something strange you could look into the -stans where you have places where there's an enclave in an enclave in an enclave (basically just looping enclaves between 2 countries)\n\nThere also are enclaves which are the size of a single town of like 12, or even half a town. And so on. Those you could call anomalies as they're not as common (still happen outside the stans as well, just what is weird of how many you have over there)\n\nKalingrad isn't even a true enclave as it's bordered by the ocean.",

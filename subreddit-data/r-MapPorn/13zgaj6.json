Until the 2000s, we didn't have life imprisonment, and the maximum term was 20 years.\n\nIn the single case of a serial killer where this was not enough, his other crimes were prosecuted separately, so another 10 years were added. In the end, he committed suicide in prison, but even if he hadn't, he would never have been released. Instead, he would've been committed to a mental institution forever.\n\nSince the law was changed, the maximum sentence extended to 40 years and life imprisonment introduced (despite lower crime rates and despite opposition from layers and judges), quite a few people have been sentenced to extreme sentences.\n\nAll those people were indeed vile criminals with whom it's very difficult to sympathise, but it has also had a knock-on effect on other sentences. So now it's normal for people to be sentenced to 20 years for crimes that would've carried 8 or 10 years before the law was changed.\n\nThe consequence is a larger prison population and all the problems that come with that, without any benefit to public safety.",

Breivik is an extreme case by an order of magnitude, but most \"normal\" severe crimes lead to early release, when people are no longer a threat (e.g. due to age). Scandinavian justice culture is less obsessed with retribution and focus more on incapacitation, then rehabilitation.",

Here it is called \"forvaring\", which basically translates to containment, and works just as mentioned above. However we also have life imprisonment, so in a sense you can argue that we have two \"kinds\" of indefinite punishments. In regards to forvaring / containment I would agree that yes, it does often in fact mainly manifest itself as a slightly more convoluted way of passing a normal life sentence.",

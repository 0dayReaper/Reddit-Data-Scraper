The ancient Greeks that encountered these steppe tribes were in awe of the horsemanship of these people and probably told tales of how the riders were virtually \"one\" with their horses, and through the generations this became the myth of Centaurs.",

Or am I misremembering that?",

That is incorrect.\n\nSyene was on the Tropic of Cancer and every year on the solstice when the Sun was at it's zenith there was no shadow and the Sun shone on the bottom of a well. Eratosthenes knew this. He could take his shadow measurement in Alexandria on the solstice at the same time and know the Sun's exact postion in Syene. No shadow there so no measurement required.\n\nAs far as the distance goes, the most common story is that he hired a Bematist, who were profession surveyors to measure the distance but this may have been unecessary. The land between Alexandria and Syene was the most surveyed land in the world at the time. Because the Nile flooded each year farm land was resurveyed every year to reset farm boundaries. The distance could have actually already been known to Eratosthenes or he could have consulted existing surveys in his role as Chief Librarian in Alexandria.",

They had to know people lived far south of them. And Herodotus reports a Phoenician expedition circumnavigated Africa around 600 BCE and he doesn\u2019t doubt it because they would\u2019ve burned up, he doubts it because he failed at astronomy. They reported the sun was to their North, and he said this was ridiculous, the sun is always to the south. Curiously, it is exactly what you\u2019d expect if you reached the southern hemisphere, suggesting the expedition may have been real. If it was real it would not be (to my knowledge) replicated for 2100 years, until Bartolomeus Diaz\u2019s sailors made the reverse voyage around 1500.",

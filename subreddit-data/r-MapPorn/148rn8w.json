I think a lot of models use the current size of the complex around the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque as markers for how big it was. Although the destruction of the temple might have widened the 'hill' it was standing on because of the rubble. So could have been a little smaller in size than what the current temple complex is built on.",

Nowadays its spread so far out from an influx of folks from NY and LA.  Housing prices have hit all time highs due to high demand and not enough supply.  Even the houses in rough shape get sold.     \n\n\nEven if our societies, values and systems have evolved, I believe we have a lot more in common with people from a couple millennia ago than we do different.",

Remember how Herodotus wrote about his own people beating 5 million invading Persians? Like that. \n\n6 Million people in roman era Israel with antiquity era agriculture and logistics ain't happening, and at the idea of a million people going to a festival the thought of \"humanitarian catastrophe\" comes to mind. Even today that would be a major challenge. Caesars mere 11 legions, some 60.000 people, in Gaul at around the same time needed the entire territory of modern day France to support them with food, a major hassle that he wouldn't shut up about in his writing.",

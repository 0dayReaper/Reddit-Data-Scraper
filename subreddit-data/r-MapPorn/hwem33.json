It even went into a whole bit about how it plays a part in dabbawalas which is one of the coolest fucking things I've ever seen logistically and blew my fucking mind. Highly reccomend watching if you can find it since I think they took it off Netflix.",

Ports would already be the biggest cities but you would also likely have junctions and your workers have to live near the resources. And those workers need supplies and entertainment and all sorts of things. \n\nIn the US, there's tons of cities that started out as simple railway workers' settlements or developed around important junctions. Where there that many pre-existing (large) settlements in colonial Africa that the railways had no impact like that?",

Taking Congo as an example railways connect pretty much all the major cities in the southeast and the northeast. In the rest of the country the Congo river (and later ordinary roads) were the main way of transport so rails were only build to fill in the gaps (places with rapids and waterfalls, not accessible to boats). Also the rainforest made it hard to build railways there anyway.\n\nThe actual problem with African railways are that they are very linear and sparse, so while there's service within the core region the periphery has little to no railways.",

Chicago is at the site of the shortest overland connection between navigable parts of the St. Lawrence watershed (i.e. the entire Great Lakes and every river that feeds them), and the Mississippi watershed (the entire middle third of the U.S.)\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Portage\n\nThe Illinois and Michigan Canal was built in 1848 to connect the Chicago River and the Illinois River and as a result a huge amount of cargo was moved through Chicago. It became a big market town (most agricultural futures and options are still traded there today at the CME). Chicago's population went from a few hundred in a tiny trading fort village in 1805 to over a million people by 1905.",

It is mainly focused on foreigners as ticket price is too high for normal Indians to afford.\n\nIf you want to take normal trains, then my suggestion would be to take AC ticket, and also to travel with atleast one friend.",

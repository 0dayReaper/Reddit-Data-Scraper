This does presume complete accuracy for the map, which may not be guaranteed with stuff like name changes and declarations of independences.\n\nI managed to narrow down the date to 1971 to 1975 using the dates of the Republic of Zaire beginning in 1971 and Republic of Dahomey ending in 1975, though this is more obviously indicated by the Vietnam War being shown.\n\nI managed to narrow it down to 1975 by Timor Leste which declared it's independence that year, before being annexed by Indonesia the following year.\n\nBefore that, my thought process was noticing that it was a Cold War map, then focusing on Africa for name changes. Upper Volta was the first I noticed, them I looked at Dahomey, Zaire, Rhodesia, and Eritrea (as it was still part of Ethiopia on the map).\n\nLeaving Africa with a 4 year time frame, I finally noticed the Vietnam War before seeing Timor Leste which got me the year.",

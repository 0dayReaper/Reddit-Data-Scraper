            "comment": "**Jut** is an indicator I developed to quantify how sharply or impressively a mountain rises above its surroundings, considering both its *height above surroundings* and *steepness*.\n\nLooking at the highest-jut mountains in the Alps, we discover incredibly impressive summits that score lowly on traditional elevation-based rankings. An example is the [**Eiger**](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/North_face.jpg) (jut: 1660 m), whose North Face rises 1800 meters at a near-vertical angle above its surroundings, almost double the local rise of El Capitan in Yosemite. Perhaps even more remarkable is [**Monte Agner**](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Sunset_Study_-_Flickr_-_rachel_thecat.jpg) (jut: 1584 m) in the Italian Dolomites\u2014despite having a fairly low elevation of only 2872 m, it looks like something straight out of Skyrim.\n\nFun facts about jut:\n\n* The highest jut in the contiguous U.S. goes to [Mount Rainier](https://d9-wret.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/palladium/production/s3fs-public/styles/full_width/public/thumbnails/image/Rainier89_mount_rainier_puyallup_daffodil_field_04-08-89.jpg?itok=mwl6U_hJ) (jut: 1332 m), a massive stratovolcano in Washington State ([contiguous U.S. jut map](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/12bm08v/oc_mountains_in_the_contiguous_us_by_rise_above/) for comparison). The highest jut in the entire U.S. goes to the North Peak of Denali (jut: 2548 m). In comparison, Mount Everest \"only\" measures a jut of 2211 m. However, the highest jut in the world goes to [Annapurna Fang](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mountaineering/comments/xeba6s/unclimbed_southwest_face_of_annapurna_fang_the/) (jut: 3395 m) in Nepal, whose southwest face could rightfully be deemed the biggest mountain face on this planet.\n* The Alps feature a very high jut for their elevation. In comparison, the Colorado Rockies, while having a similar elevation, measure a maximum jut of below 850 meters. Mountain ranges with both similar elevation and jut as the Alps include the Canadian Rockies and Patagonian Andes.\n\nFor more info on jut, feel free to check out [**How Jut Works**](https://peakjut.com/about) or my [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01600). To search up the jut of a mountain you know, or find high-jut mountains near you (or in your country / state), you can use my site [**PeakJut.com**](https://PeakJut.com).\n\nPlease let us know if you have any questions or comments\u2014I'm happy to address them!",

            "comment": "nice map. haven't been to the alps; but your map shows clearly the Swiss Alps (and just over the Swiss border) are way more impressive than the rest of the range. Looks like there's two ranges that stand out: one from Mount Blanc to around Zermatt and continuing eastward following the Swiss-Italian border, another further north from Mount Blanc through the Lauterbrunnen valley. with a low area in between. And the Dolomites make another separate small cluster rather distant from the main part of the highest part of the Alps.Whenever I make it out to the Alps, I'll make sure to visit those parts.\n\nI'd say the Colorado Rockies have low jut for their elevation rather than just the Alps are very high. Norway's peak stands out even more relative to their elevation, imo",

                    "comment": "Your observations are very perceptive! There are three jut hotspots with very impressive mountains in the Swiss Alps:\n\n1. Jungfrau / Eiger / Lauterbrunnen region (jut: 1856 m)\n2. Mont Blanc / Grandes Jorasses region (jut: 1785 m)\n3. Weisshorn / Matterhorn region (jut: 1664 m)\n\nThe Dolomites are also very impressive, with the highest jut values measured at [**Monte Agner**](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Sunset_Study_-_Flickr_-_rachel_thecat.jpg), [**Croda Marcora**](https://web.archive.org/web/20161013023304if_/http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/10156670.jpg), and [**Monte Antelao**](https://dolomitimountainresort.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Monte-Antelao-Panoramica-e1467129294751.jpg).\n\nYour comments about Norway are accurate - the highest jut values in Norway just exceed 1200 meters, which is very impressive considering lots of these mountains measure an elevation below 2000 meters. Generally, jut-to-elevation ratio tends to increase as you go near the poles, as glaciers tend to carve out deep valleys and steep slopes.",

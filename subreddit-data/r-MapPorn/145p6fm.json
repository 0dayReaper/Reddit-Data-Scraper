            "comment": "&gt;Will it be the death of Hong Kong?\n\nLol, who comes up with these bogus, politically charged ideas? The rise of Shenzhen and Guangzhou will only uplift Hong Kong, especially as the 3 cities become more integrated in terms of economics and transportation. \n\nShenzhen is the largest tech hub of the second-largest economy in the world. Hong Kong is the financial capital of Asia. The investment capital from Hong Kong helps to propel the innovation and development happening in Shenzhen's hyper-competitive tech ecosystem. Meanwhile, Guangzhou is the cultural and population capital of all Southern China. \n\nProbably the only thing I did not like seeing when we visited in 2019 was the lack of spoken Cantonese. But with dialect erosion, you also have the added benefit of less tribalism, especially with young people, so some good does come with the bad. In any case, we hope to have the opportunity to live there in the future.",

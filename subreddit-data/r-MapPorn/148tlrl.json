No external nation intervened on the revolution, the people fighting for independency were the local population (I mean people that lived there for 300 years), the independence of Central America was held by the local governments, not some foreigner militia. I also would like to clarify that this \"union\" lasted two years.\n\nIn conclusion, what happened in central America was a revolution, what happened in the north of Mexico was an invasion.",

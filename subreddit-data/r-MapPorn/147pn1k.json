Spotify entered the Russian market very late, so he had to compete with local services for customers. I used Spotify and the service from Yandex. In the end, I went back to Yandex again because its music selection algorithms turned out to be better.\n\nA subscription to Yandex services costs 399 rubles (about $ 5 and if you pay for a year, there is a discount) but it includes music, movies, a place in the cloud, a discount on taxi and food delivery. They also have their own smart speaker. VK Music also has other services besides music. Spotify had nothing to oppose such competitors, so they tried to capture the market at a price. My opinion is why they left Russia - it's easier to save face. It's easier to say that thay left because of the war and other things than because of a loss in the competition.\n\nBut it would be better for users if they stayed. The more competitors, the better for users.",

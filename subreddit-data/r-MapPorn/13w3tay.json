And a lot of it is institutionalized corruption, unfortunately. \n\n(From speaking with an acquaintance who worked in relief care after the recent floods in Pakistan, this is what he observed.)",

Which is why if you do want to help, take some extra bit of time and find NGO's doing the actual work. Don't pay directly to the governments. During the floods here in Pakistan, the NGO's actually did their job and helped people. There's always a bunch of aid organizations working hard to help people. We should appreciate them more.",

The author albert smyzansk wrote a great book on the matter called \"human right in the USSR\".\n\nFor Mao, the number of death of the cultural revolution given by dieng xaoping was around 16 million death since the chinese revolution, wich is nowhere near the 45 million death uniquely for the cultural revolution spread in the west. The cultural revolution was indeed not usefull and even critisized by Mao succesor.\n\nKilling people is always a bad thing, but there is some time where it is necessary like when a bounch of high position people in your country fear your country losing to the nazi and make deal whit them to stay alive, if the purge didn't happen, the USSR wouldn't have survive the nazis. Wich in Mao's case he didn't had this excuses, and such this was indeed a bad thing to do, but we are in fact not mindless and don't need to agree and support 100% of what they did and represent. \n\nThese leader were democraticaly elected and such claim of being undemocratic comes from the lack of comprehension of their system. My longer comment on Staline will go more specific in these claims, but i must admit that in Mao's case i do even myself don't know enough about their system, but i think remembering them using a similar system then the soviet. \n\nThose country were very much democracy, not perfect as any country, but better then the west. Claiming them or us being fascist painted in red is not understanding what we want and fascism, i think that Michael Parenti explore this question in his book \"Blackshirts and red\", but i didn't read it yet. In fact fascism is the total opposit of communism and is very close to liberalism. Communism is a society whitout class, money and stat while fascism (the marxist definition is when the governement abandone the facade democracy and openly use violence to maintain profit rate) a hyperclassified society where the governement is all powerful and where the state protect profit at any cost, even at the end of WW 2 nazi germany was still running a market economy while all other country including the USA had turned to a command economy like the soviet. Liberal always loved fascism, the UK helped put mussolini in power because socialism was gainning ground, before WW 2 all country signed none agression pact whit germany while refusing to join the soviet anti-fascit league. And still after WW 2 they supported fascism, no capitalist country ever had any problem trading or interacting whit Franco's Spain. They were even still putting fascist in power (chile and argentina), supporting already in power fascist (Guatemala, south korea, south Vietnam,  philippines, Ta\u00efwan and previously mentioned Spain) and helping different fascist organization (the contrats in latine america).\n\nWasn't able to copy and paste it so here is the source about Stalin.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GenZJosephStalin/comments/p7p3lv/masterpost_on_joseph_stalin_sweeping_away_the_dust/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button",

They claim the Gulag system was primarily used to imprison and exploit political dissidents, suspected enemies of the state, and other people deemed \"undesirable\" by the Soviet government. They claim that prisoners were sent to the Gulag without trial or due process, and that they were subjected to harsh living conditions, forced labour, and starvation, among other things. According to them, the Gulags were emblematic of Stalinist repression and totalitarianism.\n\n# Origins of the Mythology\n\nThis comically evil understanding of the Soviet prison system is based off only a handful of unreliable sources.\n\nRobert Conquest's *The Great Terror* (published 1968) laid the groundwork for Soviet fearmongering, and was based largely off of defector testimony.\n\nRobert Conquest worked for the British Foreign Office's Information Research Department (IRD), which was a secret Cold War propaganda department, created to publish anti-communist propaganda, including black propaganda; provide support and information to anti-communist politicians, academics, and writers; and to use weaponised information and disinformation and \"fake news\" to attack not only its original targets but also certain socialists and anti-colonial movements.\n\n&gt;He was Solzhenytsin before Solzhenytsin, in the phrase of Timothy Garton Ash.\n&gt;\n&gt;The Great Terror came out in 1968, four years before the first volume of The Gulag Archipelago, and it became, Garton Ash says, \"a fixture in the political imagination of anybody thinking about communism\".\n&gt;\n&gt;\\- Andrew Brown.

Until 1952, the prisoners were given a guaranteed amount food, plus extra food for over-fulfillment of quotas\n&gt;\n&gt;2. From 1952 onward, the Gulag system operated upon \"economic accountability\" such that the more the prisoners worked, the more they were paid.\n&gt;\n&gt;3. For over-fulfilling the norms by 105%, one day of sentence was counted as two, thus reducing the time spent in the Gulag by one day.\n&gt;\n&gt;4. Furthermore, because of the socialist reconstruction post-war, the Soviet government had more funds and so they increased prisoners' food supplies.\n&gt;\n&gt;5. Until 1954, the prisoners worked 10 hours per day, whereas the free workers worked 8 hours per day. From 1954 onward, both prisoners and free workers worked 8 hours per day.\n&gt;\n&gt;6. A CIA study of a sample camp showed that 95% of the prisoners were actual criminals.\n&gt;\n&gt;7. In 1953, amnesty was given to 70% of the \"ordinary criminals\" of a sample camp studied by the CIA. Within the next 3 months, most of them were re-arrested for committing new crimes.\n&gt;\n&gt;\\- Saed Teymuri. (2018).

With the collapse of the USSR and the opening of the Soviet archives, researchers can now access actual archival evidence to prove or disprove these claims. Predictably, it turned out the propaganda was just that.\n\n&gt;Unburdened by any documentation, these \u201cestimates\u201d invite us to conclude that the sum total of people incarcerated in the labor camps over a twenty-two year period (allowing for turnovers due to death and term expirations) would have constituted an astonishing portion of the Soviet population. The support and supervision of the gulag (all the labor camps, labor colonies, and prisons of the Soviet system) would have been the USSR\u2019s single largest enterprise.\n&gt;\n&gt;In 1993, for the first time, several historians gained access to previously secret Soviet police archives and were able to establish well-documented estimates of prison and labor camp populations. They found that the total population of the entire gulag as of January 1939, near the end of the Great Purges, was 2,022,976. ...\n&gt;\n&gt;Soviet labor camps were not death camps like those the N@zis built across Europe. There was no systematic extermination of inmates, no gas chambers or crematoria to dispose of millions of bodies. Despite harsh conditions, the great majority of gulag inmates survived and eventually returned to society when granted amnesty or when their terms were finished. In any given year, 20 to 40 percent of the inmates were released, according to archive records. Oblivious to these facts, the Moscow correspondent of the New York Times (7/31/96) continues to describe the gulag as \u201cthe largest system of death camps in modern history.\u201d ...\n&gt;\n&gt;Most of those incarcerated in the gulag were not political prisoners, and the same appears to be true of inmates in the other communist states...\n&gt;\n&gt;\\- Michael Parenti. (1997). [Blackshirts &amp; Reds: Rational Fascism and the Overthrow of Communism](https://archive.org/details/michael-parenti-blackshirts-and-reds)\n\nThis is 2 million out of a population of 168 million (roughly 1.2% of the population). For comparison, in the United States, \"over 5.5 million adults \u2014 or 1 in 61 \u2014 are under some form of correctional control, whether incarcerated or under community supervision.\" That's 1.6%. So in both relative and absolute terms, the United States' Prison Industrial Complex *today* is larger than the USSR's Gulag system at its peak.",

Even Conservative and anti-Communist historians have had to acknowledge this reality:\n\n&gt;It turns out that, with the exception of the war years, a very large majority of people who entered the Gulag left alive...\n&gt;\n&gt;Judging from the Soviet records we now have, the number of people who died in the Gulag between 1933 and 1945, while both Stalin and Hit1er were in power, was on the order of a million, perhaps a bit more.\n&gt;\n&gt;\\- Timothy Snyder. (2010). *Bloodlands: Europe Between Hit1er and Stalin*\n\n(Side note: Timothy Snyder is *also* a member of the Council on Foreign Relations)\n\nThis is still very high for a prison mortality rate, representing the brutality of the camps. However, it also clearly indicates that they were not *death* camps.\n\nNor was it slave labour, exactly. In the camps, although labour *was* forced, it was not uncompensated. In fact, the prisoners were paid market wages (less expenses).\n\n&gt;We find that even in the Gulag, where force could be most conveniently applied, camp administrators combined material incentives with overt coercion, and, as time passed, they placed more weight on motivation. By the time the Gulag system was abandoned as a major instrument of Soviet industrial policy, the primary distinction between slave and free labor had been blurred: Gulag inmates were being paid wages according to a system that mirrored that of the civilian economy described by Bergson....\n&gt;\n&gt;The Gulag administration [also] used a \u201cwork credit\u201d system, whereby sentences were reduced (by two days or more for every day the norm was overfulfilled).\n&gt;\n&gt;\\- L.

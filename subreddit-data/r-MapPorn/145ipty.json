The British certainly tried to (the infamous \"Black Line\" being part of it) but there are thousands of palawa people still around today.\n\nPeople often get confused because it is true that there isn't anyone of 100% palawa descent anymore, but that doesn't mean they are extinct. It would be ridiculous to claim, for instance, that an enrolled member of the Cherokee tribe of partial European descent but raised in Cherokee culture and of proven Cherokee heritage was not Cherokee.\n\nA lot of palawa culture and language was lost forever due to genocide and colonisation, but there were small groups that continued practising parts of their culture and held onto their identity. Often this was in secret until very recently because of intense racism against them, and ironically because it was widely accepted that Tasmania's First Nations peoples were \"extinct\", ergo anyone claiming to be palawa was ridiculed and not believed.\n\nOf all Australia's states and territories, Tasmania actually has the second highest proportion of the population identifying as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander (5.4%, compared to 3.2% for the whole country). Not everyone who identifies as Aboriginal in Tasmania is palawa, but the First Nations of Tasmania definitely aren't \"extinct\".\n\nEdit: To be clear, I'm *not* suggesting the palawa were not subjected to genocide or that the British \"weren't that bad\" because they didn't manage to totally annihilate the palawa (not from lack of trying). I'm trying to address the common misconception that the palawa are \"extinct\", because it is a cruel irony that acceptance of the fact they were genocided has led to constant questioning and undermining of continued modern palawa identity.",

People were appalled by what happened and ownership was transferred to the Belgian state which started developing the country and its population, profiting greatly from Congo's resources while trying to prove to the world it was bettering the Congolese.   \n\nThen in the 60s Congo became independent and Belgium was afraid of the communist leaning prime minister and losing influence so they offed him and put dictator Mobutu in place. Belgium continued to destabilize the country so it could make profitable deals with Mobutu for Congo's resources, and also to prove to the world and its people how much better things were under their control. This mostly so reparations would not be a discussion, as then you can make the case the Congolese were benefitting greatly from colonization as it brought stability and development.  \n\nBelgians in the sixties were basically brainwashed with the image of Leopold II who drove away the Muslim slave traders and started developing Congo, bringing riches to the Congolese as well as the Belgians. And how the Belgian state continued that trend. Most of the Leopold II statues in Belgium are from that time. It's the same as the confederate monuments in the US, they exist only to support a history that didn't happen. Anyway, those 18% are the uneducated brainwashed folk raised in the sixties.",

They\u2019re typically very vocal when it comes to racism/slavery in the US and its impacts on wealth inequalities, how we need to pay reparations, etc. But when you bring up how Europe colonized Africa and kind of destroyed it, took artifacts to display at European museums, etc\u2026many of them will tell you that those ex-colonies are unstable and in poverty because of their own corruption and bad decisions. Which is interesting.",

They were taken from existing slave trade stations in these African nations. Slavery has been a part of humanity since forever in all parts of the world. The only reason slavery is now banned worldwide is because Britain waged a war against it for centuries. For no profit motive and costing Britain mind boggling sums of money to the point that the last money paid to settle the debts was paid by tax money in 2015. Britain spent 40% of it's national budget in 1833 to buy freedom for all slaves in the empire. It's one of the proudest moments of British history and people are trying to blame them for slavery instead, it's honestly disgusting.",

My parent were still taught that it was a civilizing mission and that we freed the slave of the Congo from the Arab trade slaver (well its kinda true but that doesn't negate what came next) and shit ton of other propaganda that were kinda hitting that Congo would probably be better of if we took over again.\n\nAnd even a few years ago in school, it was still kinda a weird chapter in history class where the chapter talked about the atrocities but like, minimizing them. Obviously now that everyone has internet, the lie is crumbling but yeah it's still very recent for us.\n\nIn class we even learned about an independence song of the Congo, it's kind of catchy so with my friend we sang it randomly and he told me he sang it when he was at his grandmother place and she got angry because \"it's the song that made us loose the Congo\"\n\nThe great thing about ruler that do a lot of atrocities is that they love doing a ton of propaganda about how great they are and Leopold II propaganda's was never really dismantled up until recently. So there is almost a century worth of people who have been taught how great Leopold II was for getting us the Congo",

If you ask a white Brazilian they will likely tell that they suffer from the consequences of colonialism as well, although acknowledging that pardos, blacks and Indigenous Brazilians suffer more with that.\n\nWhy that? Because in Brazil the structures created in colonial times permeate the whole society (you gringos love to talk about corruption in Latin America, right? So, here is an appropriate time to talk about it).\n\nOf course different groups are affected at different levels, but in Brazil the bad consequences of colonialism are so pervasive that they affect almost everyone. For instance: when slavery was about to be banned, the state of S\u00e3o Paulo started to receive loads of Italian immigrants to work for people who had just recently owned slaves in the coffee farms. Their work conditions were atrocious (of course, their bosses were such nice people /s), although corporal punishment was forbidden in their case.",

If you live in a country that speaks a language no one else understands even remotely, and your school system tells you how grand and pure-blooded your 'race' is day in and day out, you're just bound to more or less assume that something about what they're saying must be right, since no one's chiming in going 'But I've heard..!'. \n\nSame thing happens in the US, so not surprising. Even the most educated Americans I've met so far held onto certain beliefs and rights (hereditary nationality, gun laws, ...) which to Europeans can only be described as literal cave man IQ. I can only assume that's because of their education system over there.",

That's all connected, and that's what they're proud of.\n\nBut when you ask them if the people that were colonised were better off (mainly Indonesia), they know they were worse off, and know that the wealth of the Dutch golden age actually partly came from exploiting other people.\n\nAbout the people who still want an empire, I'm as baffled as you are. I'm hopeful people didn't think about it enough and just like the romanticised idea of an empire and being powerful, and don't think about the human rights violations that would be involved.",

They seemed to have beleived \"Papist races\" where racially incapable pf supporting democracy and republic government and would religiously try to overthrow such structures to create pro papal monarchies.

The core tenets of Christianity  were not established buy the Bible,  though they are justified by what's in the Bible,  just as Mormonism's core beliefs are justified buy the Bible.  But Christianity's core doctrine of the Trinity and the definition of the nature of God was established in the 4th century by the Nicean Creed and later supported by the apostles creed and athanasian creed. Prior to the 4th century,  the core beliefs of modern Christianity were unclear and disagreed upon. Some claimed the trinitsrian view, some the godhead, some that Christ was just a prophet and not the son of God, and many other disagreements.  Once Constantine converted there was a need to standardize church doctrine so a bunch of scholars and factions came together to hash out all out. At this time there was no claim of Priesthood, no claim of prophets, nor claim of any revelation directly from God either being sought or occurring. Essentially there were a bunch of men using the wisdom of their day to try and define true doctrine with limited resources and lacking agreement.  At this point the New Testament didn't even yet exist, that would come a couple of decades later.  \n\nSo let's be honest here,  \"Christian\" or \"Catholic\" claims as to what real Christianity is had no more validity to it than the Mormon definition, aside from time.  Simply because it's older,  you all think it's right. \n\nNow the Mormon definition of Christ, like traditional Christianity, is fully justified by the Bible.  Both religions can go back and forth all day proving their beliefs with the Bible and get nowhere. The Mormons claim their definition of Christ came directly through revelation from God and Christ himself. Compared to how Christian doctrine came about,  the Mormons have a powerful claim there.   Now does that mean it's automatically true? Of course not,  but it's not any less believable as a source of truth than how modern Christian doctrine was established.  The reality is the Mormons are just as likely to be right about Christ as the Christians and Christians are just as likely to be wrong as the Mormons. \n\nAlso, Let's not forget that many Christians don't even consider Catholics to be Christian, which is utterly preposterous as they are the ones that established the Christian definition of Christ in the first place. \n\nAlso your comparison of Mormons to Muslims in relation to Christianity is silly and ignorant. Muslims believe Christ to be a good man and a true prophet but not the Son of God, not the Messiah, not the Savior of the World. ( which in and of itself is its own logical fallacy,  but I digress). Whereas Mormons agree fully with Christianity that Christ is the Son of God, the Messiah,  and the Savior of the World. Very much inline with traditional Christian beliefs.",

You can try and justify it any way you want, but the reality is that it\u2019s not a Christian denomination, it\u2019s one man\u2019s book from the 1830s he wrote himself and one in which he decided to cast out Christian doctrine that had been established for literal millennia to be replaced with his own. It\u2019s not Christianity, full stop. The Christian Bible absolutely does not support the book of Mormon\u2019s depiction of Christ, and is very clear about the Trinity. \n\nYou can believe what you want to believe, I\u2019m not going to question the validity of your faith, but to assert its Christian is grotesquely incorrect and every modern theologian agrees. Nobody but Mormons recognize Mormonism as Christianity.",

Have you ever actually debated the Trinity vs Godhead using the Bible only? I suspect not,  because if you did you'd learn that it's an unwinnable debate. Both beliefs are easily justified by the Bible.  I've actually debated both sides, I've had friends scofging at the trinitarian view and I debated it with them using the Bible and obviously I've debated the Godhead with traditional Christians. It's a fruitless endeavor.  \n\nAnd clearly you didn't read my whole post. Because you replied too fast.  The foundation of the Trinity doctrine and its origins are at best as shaky as the origins of the Godhead doctrine.  \n\nAll that said,  I too fully respect your faith and am thrilled you believe in Christ and accept him as your Savior.  I too have done the same. And like you I fully accept the Bible as the word of God and as canonized scripture. \n\nBut please stop going around on Reddit acting like you have any sort of accurate understanding of Mormonism when you clearly don't.  And I recommend spending some solid time researching the origins of your own beliefs.",

They teach the Bible which every other Christian community has is corrupted. And they also reject the authority of established church communities. Basically, Smith came along and said \u201cthe church has lost its way\u201d and \u201cthe Bible has lost its way\u201d and then wrote his own text to start a new religion. Sure, it borrows a lot from Christianity. But it is so very different. Might as well be Scientology with paintings of Jesus.",

We respect and honor Joseph just as we, our Jewish, and other Christian brothers and sisters honor and respect Moses as a prophet. \n\nBut Jesus Christ is at the core of our religion. We, like other Christians, believe Christ to be the son of God, the Savior of the World, and that the grace of Christ saves all mankind. Without Christ all would be lost. \n\nNow regarding the \"golden tablets\", those are what we have today as the Book of Mormon. The Book of Mormon is a Testament of Christ. The entire book points people to Jesus and teaches of him. I highly recommend anyone who loves Jesus and has a desire to understand him better to read it. \n\nThis verse from the Book of Mormon puts it best:\n\n\"And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.\" -2 Nephi 25:26",

I\u2019m curious if the tablets were found in the 1800s by Joseph Smith in New York where are they today? For it to be the added foundation of a religion and it be so recent in the term of History why is it gone? We still have locations artifacts and literature from the days Jesus walked with us.",

The red Catholic areas are quite nice, but they also have some of the worst off counties in the country in South Dakota, New York's North Country, and along the Mexican border. The green LDS areas on the map are also very nice, but there's also some very desolate locations there as well. \n\nI see no strong correlation between the locations of different forms of the Christian faith and parts of the country that should be generalized as \"shitty.\"",

At first glance, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, virtually all of Africa, Indonesia, Southeast Asia, both Korea\u2019s and Iraq is wrong. \n\nIt\u2019s like you just made it all up\n\nEdit: 118 isn\u2019t even the low end of people gaining lawful permanent residence. It\u2019s the Maldives and Comoros each with 4 people",

Further more there\u2019s countries on here that are shaded wrong. Here\u2019s another example. South Africa is dark colored and Yemen is light gray. But Yemen had more people gain lawful permanent residence in 2021. Same for Thailand and South Africa. Thailand had more. \n\nYou should probably get a source than questioning the one I provided. You know the one from the US department of homeland security. It\u2019s all in table 3 on that pdf",

Czech-Austria from 1918, should be yellow.\n\nSlovak-Hungary and Poland 1918, also yellow. \n\nOtherwise, OP how do you calculate the age of the borders? For example, the border between Czech Republic and Slovakia in its current form existed already in 907, when the Great Moravia under attack by the Hungarians fell apart and western territory joined to Bohemia and its eastern territory known today as Slovakia was conquered by the Hungarians.",

These changes may even happen without anyone noticing. Just like changes that are essentially 'discoveries' as outcomes of conflicting interpretations of primary sources. The Netherlands and Belgium are just extraordinarily fussy about such things. \n\nThe map is pretty arbitrary with granularity and how it deals with borders that temporarily disappeared but generally follow an old division. In this sub we regularly see map of the mess of enclaves and exclaves at the border between Belgium and the Netherlands in the Baarle area, the feudal origins of which date back to the 12th century, and which officially follow 1347 borders between Turnhout and Breda (on opposite sides in the 1568-1648 war). Arbitrarily these are classified as more than 100-199 years old. Of course these were temporarily not official state borders for a few decades between Napoleon and Belgian independence, but in some other places very young countries are awarded with red pieces of border.",

Scotland didn't cease to be a country when its parliament voted for the Act of Union; Wales, in contrast was treated after annexation in 1536 as part of England until official recognition as a separate country in 1974, at which time the border was redrawn to return Monmouthshire to Wales.",

The majority of Brits wanted to either remain or have a soft Brexit. The other large parties in the Commons wanted to either remain or have a soft Brexit. Instead of cooperating with them to get that done, she shut the opposition out, presented a hard Brexit plan to the Commons, repeatedly failed to get it passed, and then resigned leading to Johnson pursuing a no-deal Brexit.",

It's also odd that you grouped ''soft Brexit'' and ''remain'' together, without defining what a ''soft Brexit'' would be, or considering the fact that voting for a ''soft Brexit,'' would still be voting for Brexit. The referendum only contained the options of leaving or remaining, there were no options of ''soft Brexit'' or ''kinda remain but not really'' etc..",

Anyone paying attention to the role of German naval policy in shaping British attitudes would have been unsurprised. Doesn't mean I can't see why Germans would think they were entitled to a big navy and a colonial empire, but if you're going to build the former for the specific purpose of destroying the British in a giant sea battle more or less right on their doorstep and undermining their entire empire and probably national survival, maybe expect them to switch sides and turn against you. Germans of the day were playing for high stakes and all their public media lines made that clear, and yet they seemed to lack self-awareness about it.\n\nAlso, they really had only collaborated against the French during a couple of brief periods in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Before that, although Anglo-French enmity had been broadly consistent for centuries and broken by alliance only periodically, it hadn't really been an Anglo-Imperial partnership.",

She was born in the polish part of the Russian empire and then went on to spend most of her youth in the polish part of the German empire. Poland was participating in a way, just not as an independent nation, because it wasn't an independent nation back then but partitioned between the German and Russian empires but polish soldiers fought under both flags",

A whole chapter is about the pacifist intellectuals in Switzerland during the war, even though not every one of them became communist as you mention it. I think he refered to the whole West European intellectual world, in an effort of generalization. As It is said in the book, before 1917, the majority was bellicist, and then in 1917 the pacifist intellectuals started to organize themselves and to be valued in the public opinion\nI would say that Zweig focuses more on the pacifist intellectuals that didn't want to take a party. He talks a lot about Romain Rolland, Rilke, etc, who are closer to Zweig than the communist intellectuals I suppose. And they actually are very important historical figures, so even though there might be a bias, I think you're wrong by saying that the pacifist intellectuals were basically communist. But I suppose that your sentence is pertinent if you want to understand the history of socialist intellectuals specifically",

(And, yes, envy over Britain's colonial Empire). Hitler, however, did *not* hate Britain but rather admired them for what we would now consider as the worst aspects of its Empirical history and actually sought to ally with Britain to further its own Empirical ambitions.\n\nIt's quite a fascinating study of the power of propaganda actually, especially how Goebbels switched the narrative in 1938 after it became apparent that Britain would oppose rather than ally with Nazi Germany.",

Hint, it was not very British.\nIn the past, Britain had also been a natural ally of Germany against France. France that possessed, the third-largest fleet in the world, something the British had been very aware of.\n\nJust a few years before WWI, any European power had been ready to ally themselves with and against any other European power, well maybe not France with Germany. That it turned out the way it did was not a given.\n\nAlso, just prior to the outbreak of the war it was not a given that Britain would join the war, at least not in the public imagination in Germany. That Britain joined the war was seen as betrayal by the German public. That is why the post card calls for the punishment of England.",

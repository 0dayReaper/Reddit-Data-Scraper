Thats an area of about 65x65 kilometers or 40x40 miles. That means that all of earth's population would snugly fit into Los Angeles.\n\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowloon_Walled_City\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population\n\nhttps://www.worldatlas.com/articles/largest-cities-in-the-world-by-land-area.html",

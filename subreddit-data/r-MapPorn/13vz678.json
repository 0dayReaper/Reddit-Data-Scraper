The entire Israeli Air Force, with the exception of just 12 fighters assigned to defend Israeli air space, took off at 7:14 a.m. in Operation Moked (aka Operation Focus) with the intent of bombing Egyptian airfields while the Egyptian pilots were eating breakfast. The day before the attack, Rabin visited several air bases and told the pilots:\r  \n\r  \n**Remember: your mission is one of life or death. If you succeed \u2013 we win the war; if you fail \u2013 God help us.**",

If a few million Japanese people moved into America and suddenly they and the UN decided to carve out half the USA to make a new Japanese state, the first reaction of most Americans would be to resist by any means necessary and not negotiate to have 30% or 40% of your land taken away instead of 56%. A federation wasn't on the table either, the Israelis wanted a Jewish ethnostate and had stated intentions of expanding into the rest of biblical Israel. This was more or less the entire point of Israel's existence, if they had agreed to federate the population would have split roughly 70-30 in favor of the Arabs. Which would make \"Israel\" basically indistinguishable from any other Arab country and rendered the entire zionist movement pointless. Even if the Palestinians played nice they would have been forced to make unbelievable concessions that no other people in the world would have been ok with given the circumstances and would still probably gotten screwed by the Israelis anyway.",

Then, Israel was a young nation surrounded by enemies only 20 years after the holocaust and bravely struck first against a much larger force. It's easy to see it as a triumphant underdog story. Nowadays, Egypt is gone from Gaza and Jordan is gone from the west bank. The Palestinian government is a schismatic mess and their territory is peppered with an increasing number of Israeli settlements. Israel no longer appears to be existentially threatened while Palestine very much does and so popular sympathies have shifted.\n\nAlso, most people don't know much about the conflict and just kinda go with whatever opinion if it's upvoted and has an authoritative tone, so basically whatever the vibe of the first 20 people who interact with the post is will have an outsized impact.",

People both online and offline look for social cues when faced with a topic they're not very knowledgeable about, trying to work out which is the \"right\" side to be on. Pro-Israel arguments, when written well and put across in an empathetic way, resonate with people as much as pro-Palestine ones do, and ultimately a lot of people do not have a firm opinion either way.",

As I recall, it was widely expected that the Israelis would probably prevail or at least hold their own. This map makes it look like it was a gross mismatch with the Arabs certain to overrun Israel, which was not the thinking at the time among the well-informed.

All I'm saying is that maps are powerful narrative tools, and that you should think critically about them. Ask questions, such as: Who made this map and for what purpose? What is emphasized and what is left out? How is the available information presented? For example, why is the military equipment of Israel not shown? What equipment is included in and excluded from what is presented on the map? This map seems to be made with the intent to maximize showing the threats posed to Israel and to thus justify the Six Day War. Again, I'm not commenting on the conflict itself. I'm just bringing attention to the fact that maps are used to push narratives. Awareness of this fact is important when discussing especially these types of maps, and doubly especially when tensions in the region are high to the present day.",

Israel had only one superiority coming into this war- brain power. You sound like such a brainwashing machine, the information here in the map is factual and you can\u2019t disprove it, meaning that the obvious conclusion- Arab countries were murderous, but super incapable, and Jews were amazing and saved themselves, IS the right conclusion. The fact you hate Israel and hate the truth shows. Get over your hate for Jews and Israel and chose peace, than you won\u2019t mind maps that show how great Israel is.",

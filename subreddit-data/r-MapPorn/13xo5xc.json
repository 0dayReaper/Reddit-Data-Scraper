What we can do is use verifiable information to make certain assumptions about the war.\n\nMonths ago, Biden said providing Ukraine with F16s was an unnecessary escalation, much like most defense experts suggested. Yet this month they committed to providing some. Why does this matter? Russia has air ~~supremacy~~ superiority, which is virtually impossible to reverse once established. F16s are extremely resource intensive to set up, train pilots, and actually operate. But they can launch long-range weapons. \n\nUkraine, considering it\u2019s already being invaded, does not care about escalation; in fact, they want escalation because it means more western involvement. The F16s are not to take back air ~~supremacy~~ superiority, they\u2019re to set a precedent for Ukraine receiving weapons capable of long range strikes into Russia. The US is obviously aware of this, which is why they previously refused to provide Ukraine with F16s. \n\nPerhaps this is a stretch, but the US must have intel that Ukraine is fighting a losing battle and Russia needs to deplete resources at a faster rate. Which is why the US is providing Ukraine with F16s - they know that air ~~supremacy~~ superiority is not going to be taken back, if they wanted Ukraine to take back air ~~supremacy~~ superiority, they\u2019d provide them with cheaper, less sophisticated planes that are easier to teach Ukrainians how to fly. What the F16s are for is for the war to be escalated and to prompt Russia to mobilize further and to hurt Putin\u2019s domestic audience by threatening Russia with long range strikes. But the US needs to maintain plausible deniability, much like with the Nordstream bombing, so that the US doesn\u2019t actually have to use its own troops. For the US, Ukraine is doing an excellent job at being cannon fodder for its geopolitical goals. \n\nSo we can go back and forth debating dubious intel sources regarding who\u2019s winning the logistics battle but it\u2019s pointless, that will only be known once the war is finished. What we know for sure though is that the US is now more comfortable with escalation, which is not something that signifies that Russia is months away from being pushed out of Ukraine. It likely signifies that Ukraine is losing resources and manpower faster than needed to thwart the invasion. \n\nBut of course, rational discussion on this topic on Reddit is not allowed, so this will fall on deaf ears for most, but I have faith in your intelligence, unlike many pro-Ukraine commenters.",

First the US says \"only IFVs, no MBTs\". Then another country in NATO gives Ukraine MBTs. And Russia doesn't escalate. So now the US says, okay a few MBTs, since we're already giving them MBTs it's not an escalation. Then it's no Cruise missiles. Until the UK gives them Storm Shadows. And Russia does nothing to escalate. Then the US says, okay, well since we're already giving them medium-range cruise missiles, maybe we can look at ATACAMs. And so on. Same with F-16s.\r\n\nThey've not being supplied because the US thinks Ukraine is 'losing the war' - whatever that means - because the last thing the Western allies want to do is throw good money after bad. Ukraine has to continuously show that they're making good use of the weapons they're being supplied for them to get more. That's why there's such a heavy focus on the Patriot PAC-3s right now, and you will most likely see more similar AD systems be sent to Ukraine in the coming months because of how successful they've been. If the US analysis was the Ukraine was losing, and giving them F-16s wouldn't change that situation... they wouldn't be greenlighting F-16s.\r \n\nThe narrative you're pushing is \"this \\[WEAPON OF THE WEEK\\] is escalation!\". And I suppose I'm wondering what kind of escalation you think is coming as a result of F-16s? More mobilization? If you think Russia has been holding back sending a million more mobiks into the fight because of \"escalation\", I really don't know what to tell you. [Here's Michael Kofman just last month](https://twitter.com/KofmanMichael/status/1654572418705289225).\n\nNo, Russia is not months away from being pushed out of Ukraine. The counter-offensive isn't gonna deal any decisive blows in this conflict. This thing will run for at least a few more years. But presuming western support doesn't waiver - and there's nothing to suggest that it will right now - Russia is looking at a ticking clock. \n\n\rBut I think in general when it comes to strategic analysis of war, lay people like us shouldn't form opinions based on our own gut feeling or biases.\r So if anyone is interested in the analysis of someone actually working in the military procurement space here's [a good video on the 'escalation' of long range weapons being sent to Ukraine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVNjqX5HQGQ).",

If the war was inevitably going to be lost by Ukraine, why would you funnel money and resources there? \n\nRegarding the boiling frog play, I pretty explicitly mentioned that in my comment.

It's like saying \"your current bank account is insufficient to pay for rent for the next 6 months\" but not taking into account that I get a salary every month. Yes, without the salary, I would lose my apartment. But seeing as I have tenure and am guaranteed employment for the foreseeable future, we should not be extrapolating from the scenario that I will lose my income anytime soon.\n\nThat is not the likely scenario.\n\nThe thing I take issue with is this statement:\n\n&gt;It likely signifies that Ukraine is losing resources and manpower faster than needed to thwart the invasion\n\nFirst of all, the invasion has already happened, and cannot be thwarted, but I assume you mean \"decisively repel the Russian invaders\"? So does sending F-16s signal that Ukraine is running out of manpower and materiel? Well. No. What it signals is we've *boiled the frog* so much that sending F-16s is no longer considered an 'escalation' by Russia in any meaningful way, and can therefore be done with little to no pushback. The US and the west never had an ideological objection to sending F-16s. They always knew they would have to eventually. Same with MBTs. In two years Ukraine will be fielding hundreds of Abrams, even though until very recently that step too was considered 'escalatory' by Russia.\n\nBut so long as Russia doesn't actually do anything except launch missiles at Kyiv...then Ukraine will be given more and more modern equipment to fight off the invasion.\n\nBecause the question remains...escalation to what? There seems to be a trhust of 'condemnation' in your post (correct me if I'm wrong) in how you describe the West as \"escalating the conflict\" by giving Ukraine more weapons and materiel. That's generally speaking a Russian talking point, and it begs the question: is giving Ukraine MBTs or 4th generation fighters or Medium Range Tactical Missiles *escalatory?* And if it is, what is it escalating to?\n\nWe've already seen *mobilization*. More mobiks isn't escalatory. Russia has been bombing civilians since the war began. More Kalibrs or Kinzhals into Maidan Square isn't an escalation. So when I see the framing of \"the west is escalating the conflict\" it feels like what's implied is that the west is \"warmongering\".\n\nWhich I hope isn't your position here.\n\nAt any rate, Ukraine will be given what it needs - peacemeal - so long as no one believes it will trigger a nuclear strike. And it's clear that F16s won't. Abrams won't. ATACMs almsot certainly won't.",

But the more Russia feels threatened (and yes, giving Ukraine aircrafts that are capable of carrying nuclear weapons deep into Russia is threatening, regardless of whether or not you think that is plausible), the more they\u2019re going to seek a complete annexation and dismantling of Ukraine as a nation state via a full-scale mobilization and war. I recognize what you\u2019re saying with the boiled frog approach the West is taking and you\u2019re insisting that \u201cescalation\u201d is nothing more than a dogwhistle, but let\u2019s not so quickly forget that the \u201cboiled frog\u201d approach to escalation is exactly what prompted Russia to invade in the first place, albeit that frog was boiling for 30 years. \n\nThis is why it\u2019s important to understand the causes of the war. It doesn\u2019t mean that you have to agree with Putin\u2019s justifications, but finger wagging at Russia and treating the war as a manic episode by a lone tyrant like most people do on Reddit is the most ideologically lazy stance to take. \n\nFor Russia, this invasion is of crucial strategic importance to the security of the country (again, you don\u2019t have to agree with the merits of this, but acknowledge that this is how the war is viewed by Russia). For Ukraine, the war is existential; Ukraine does not care about any global implications of the war, they only care about defeating Russia at any cost. Arming Ukraine will not make Russia back off, and Ukraine is unconcerned with turning this into World War 3 if that means defeating Russia. Therefore, providing Ukraine with advanced weapons can only be escalatory, no matter what the stated purpose of those weapons are. \n\nThe US knows this very well, and they don\u2019t care because Ukraine is a good laboratory to test US military equipment in a real ground war without actually deploying American soldiers, plus there\u2019s ample public support for it. The US has a vested interest in prolonging this war as much as possible because it\u2019s draining Russia\u2019s economy and making defense contractors rich, and considering Ukraine does not have the capacity to fight Russia on its own, the best way to accomplish that is, as you said, to boil the frog\u2014see how far you can push the envelope without having to sacrifice a single American life.",

It doesn\u2019t mean that you have to agree with Putin\u2019s justifications, but finger wagging at Russia and treating the war as a manic episode by a lone tyrant like most people do on Reddit is the most ideologically lazy stance to take.\n\nI'm not treating it as such. But as someone who has been opposed to every major western invasion of a sovereign country since I was 18 in 2003, I find this to be an odd talking point that's inconsistently applied. At least when I did hear a realpolitik argument like this for The Iraq War it came from Neocons.\n\nSo for my money the most ideologically lazy position to take is the one where we have to twist ourselves into knots to make sure we're in opposition to whatever thing the US is supporting at any given moment.\n\n&gt;For Russia, this invasion is of crucial strategic importance to the security of the country (again, you don\u2019t have to agree with the merits of this, but acknowledge that this is how the war is viewed by Russia). For Ukraine, the war is existential; Ukraine does not care about any global implications of the war, they only care about defeating Russia at any cost. Arming Ukraine will not make Russia back off, and Ukraine is unconcerned with turning this into World War 3 if that means defeating Russia. Therefore, providing Ukraine with advanced weapons can only be escalatory, no matter what the stated purpose of those weapons are.\n\nYour premise is flawed.\n\nYou're arguing that this might turn into WWIII if we keep supporting Ukraine with arms because Ukraine is locked in an *existential* fight and doesn't care about the ramifications beyond its  borders. Yet obviously every other western nation that's not Ukraine *does* care about this not turning into WWIII. So if it was even remotely in the calculus of the US or the EU, or any other NATO country, that supporting Ukraine in the way they currently are would would escalate to nuclear threat levels, they wouldn't do it.\n\nYou cannot apply 'rational actor logic' selectively and only when its convenient. If we're asked to consider the motivations and self-interest of Russia, we should also consider the self-interest of the West. And the West, broadly speaking, is not interested - not even a little bit - in a nuclear conflict.\n\nWhat it is interested in is the preservation of international order. Especially in its backyard. If we drop support from Ukraine, and Russia annexes the country, a precedent will have been set. And that's when we can play the game of \"what happens next?\" Do you think Russia will stop at Ukraine? If the west, broadly speaking, signals that major powers can annex smaller neighboring countries with force...what do you think will happen next? Well we can open a history book and look at the 18th and 19th centuries of adventurous imperialism to get an idea.",

I don\u2019t claim to be a clairvoyant, so I won\u2019t make predictions about the future, but the provision of military aid is not the escalation, it is how they are used. Only time will tell, but I imagine the US didn\u2019t provide Ukraine with F16s under the assumption that they will be used in small scale combat to try and regain air superiority. \n\n&gt;So this is where I'll need to see some receipts. You claim that the more Russia feels threatened (due to having 'nuclear capable' F-16s - though since Ukraine has no nukes, how exactly does this alter the nuclear threat-level?) the more likely Russia is to seek a complete annexation of Ukraine - which I'm presuming you don't believe they already were for some reason? \n\nI\u2019m confused about what you\u2019re asking for receipts for. Are you asking me to provide proof of something that is inherently speculative? Unless an \u201cexpert\u201d has access to information that I don\u2019t have, their analysis is a good as mine, I\u2019m not swayed by the appeal to authority fallacy. \n\nBut to respond to your questions: Russia has not fully mobilized, that\u2019s pretty much a consensus. No, Ukraine doesn\u2019t have nukes, but if they were part of NATO they would. They do have access to long range high capacity missiles though. And yes, Russia is not seeking annexation of Ukraine, they are seeking to install a new government, which could be seen as a de facto annexation, and fairly so, but of course materially different. Putin has been a steadfast critic of the Soviet Republic model, and it\u2019s not as though Ukraine is very pro-Russia, and certainly not if they were annexed. Russia\u2019s strategic goals are just as easily realized by installing a government similar to Lukashenko\u2019s.\n\n&gt;Is this the \"actually NATO forced Russia to invade by letting Ukraine decide whether or not it wanted to join NATO\" argument?\n\nNo, it\u2019s much more complicated than that. Happy to elaborate if you\u2019d like, but this point is irrelevant to our current discussion.\n\n&gt;So for my money the most ideologically lazy position to take is the one where we have to twist ourselves into knots to make sure we're in opposition to whatever thing the US is supporting at any given moment.\n\nI won\u2019t take it personally that you think I am currently tying myself into knots.\n\n&gt; You're arguing that this might turn into WWIII if we keep supporting Ukraine with arms\n\nThat is not what I said, I said Ukraine doesn\u2019t care if that happens.\n\nOf course the West doesn\u2019t want a nuclear conflict. That\u2019s why we just had a whole conversation about boiled frogs. I also explained the \u201crational actor logic\u201d  for the West\u2019s behavior in the last paragraph of my comment, so I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re accusing me of applying it selectively. \n\n&gt; What it is interested in is the preservation of international order. \n\nDidn\u2019t you just say you opposed the Iraq War? How do you still believe this? \n\n&gt; Do you think Russia will stop at Ukraine?\n\nPeople always apply the slippery slope fallacy to international affairs as it applies to \u201cbad\u201d countries because they believe bad countries to act out of evilness and not out of trying to achieve strategic interests. States will do what they want when they can, precedents have never mattered before, and no \u201cinternational order\u201d can prevent that, I thought that was sufficiently proven a long time ago.\n\nEdit: the guy I\u2019m replying to blocked me lol.

This is the primary point in this list. They are the ones who determine when and what sort of peace they will settle with. They design and choose their own military actions. This does involve US intelligence and support yes but Ukraine are the ones at the helm so to speak.\n\nThe second is that Ukraine shows it is able to keep fighting in an effective manner. As long as NATO believes it is worth providing Ukraine with heavy equipment they will continue to do so. If not then Ukraine will be forced into guerrilla warfare to slowly drive out the Russians over the course of years to possibly a decade even.\n\nThe third is US elections. Though unlikely, if trump wins I don\u2019t think anyone has any sort of misconception as to wether US support will continue. This could lead to a gradual knock on effect across NATO where others slowly withdraw their own support. Though I doubt Poland and the Baltics will follow this will undoubtedly create a difficult situation for Ukraine.\n\n\nThis is Ukraine\u2019s war not NATO\u2019s. if it were it would\u2019ve ended back in April 2022.",

China sent literal human waves against a relatively small US force and in the end they were pushed back after suffering heavy losses.\n\nNumbers alone just don\u2019t matter if they\u2019re not properly supplied and supported.

Ukraine suffered heavily trying to keep that place and it obviously affected their offensive plans since spring passed and we got none of it, so Russia did a really impressive urban warfare job there. \n\nNot to mention the fact that Ukraine sent only the best troops in Bakhmut since 2014, which also means that they also lost big chunk of the most experienced and the best trained soldiers there, so they are left with unexperienced and \"green\" soldiers for counter-offensive against extremely well prepared defense by Russia (on most of the front line Russia have 3 lines of fortified defence lines, even crossing one is borderline impossible, especially since Russia have upper hand in artillery).",

Do you also realize that there are nazis fighting on the Russian side too? Wagner alone literally has members with Swastikas and SS chevrons tattooed on their chests so unless you're a massive hypocrite i dont see what you are basing your morals on. Do you also realize that most of these nazis have appeared after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and sent their proxies into Donbass? That Azov officialy formed a month or so after the annexation of Crimea, the relations between Ukraine and Russia were fine before Russia started its military aggression against Ukraine. Seems to me like most of those who cry about Ukrainian nazis like you are wholefully ignorant to any of the context or most likely simply pretend to be ignorant.",

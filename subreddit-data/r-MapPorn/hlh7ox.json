It is actually too late to really do anything about the islands - which will mostly be gone by 2050.  The problem is that there is no international recognition of such a thing as a \"climate refugee\", so as the people try to leave the island, there is literally no where that will take them. No nation wants to set a precedent that refugee status can be determined by climate.  \n\nI highly highly recommend the documentary film [*Anote's Ark*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anote%27s_Ark), which chronicles the President of Kiribati as he tries to bring attention internationally to his people's plight, and their refugee crisis.",

For the US, those numbers are 2 and 6. Who wants to figure out if the majority of countries are those close to a 1:2 (50%) ratio?",

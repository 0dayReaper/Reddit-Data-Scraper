The town itself is also not especially ugly and is very well connected to the Urban area. The only unusual thing there is a very low percentage of  Roman Catholics (a lot of Old Catholics - Mariavites live there). The only explanation I have in mind is that many farmers sell their properties for a considerable amount of money, so \u0141\u00f3d\u017a suburbia are growing rapidly and abuse alcohol soon after. The same thing can be related to Zgierz county, so the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Hills Landscape Park is also located there, attracting people to settle.",

Doesn't reflect the datas here.\n\nI checked this one and it seems to have quite a history. \n\nMaybe the best proof is a French proverb, \u201eivre comme un Polonais\u201d, which means \u201edrunk as a Pole.'' There is a whole mythology around it now when it comes to French and Polish soldiers during the Napoleonic Wars drinking together and then only Poles being able to stand, fight and win the battle. Napoleon supposedly commented on this phenomenon saying: \u201eif you drink, drink like Poles\u201d. That\u2019s of course to show how Poles can handle alcohol and how brave it makes them (what really happened \u2013 during a campaign in Spain, Napoleon gave an order which one of his officers commented \u201eyou must be drunk to carry it out\u201d; Poles actually followed the order and won, which then Napoleon commented \u201eI wish all my armies were drunk as Poles'' - so it\u2019s all within the world of metaphors).\n\n\nSo it looks like the data could still be correct. They get drunk as hell but still do what needs to be done.",

I noticed it only after seeing people abroad being so drunk, they were just spending most of the party laying down on the ground. Meanwhile the average Pole would be twice as drunk and still trying to run some errands after the party lmao \n\nOf course, our reputation precedes us as well. I've been told many times OHHH SO YOU'RE NOT POLISH CAUSE YOU DON'T DRINK.... \n\nHad a funny situation with an old Cypriot speaking very broken English but he was very determined to talk to me and ask me about my tattoos. He brought me an orange juice from the fridge and after that he learned that I was Polish - \"*Polish? So you want a beer? Not a juice?\"*",

To give a crude and relatively awful example, if you've got a kid and you unfortunately lose it to illness or whatever else, it's not \"hardship\" for a day or two or a month, you'll remember your kid and always feel pain to some degree.  \nIn our case, despite the deportations being over with after stalin's death, the russification continued as well as attempts to move in more russians here, with which they try to make your language obsolete, useless and try to replace it.   \nThere's reasons why multiple people burned themselves alive in city centers here in protests, even though they were born around/post death of stalin.",

In general, places that drink beer will always be healthier than places that drink vodka. I'm what westerners could call an alcoholic but my health has changed dramatically since I switched from vodka to beer. \n\nVodka literally kills your brain and fucks you up permanently. It's disgusting, degenerate, and flat out the most embarrassing Polish invention (which we invented to destroy Russia but that's another topic.)  Beer is better because it fills you up quickly so you literally can't drink more or you'll vomit and you can drink less percentage versions after an easy day of work. So yes, drink beer, not vodka.",

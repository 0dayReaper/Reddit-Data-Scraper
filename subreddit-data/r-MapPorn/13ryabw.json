A is for the first half of January, B for the second half, C for the first half of February, and so on. I is skipped since it sometimes looks like 1. V therefore means that the asteroid was discovered in the first half of November.\n\nThe rest indicates how many asteroids were discovered before this one in that half month. The first asteroid gets an A, the second a B, I is skipped again. The 26th asteroid gets an A\u2081, the 27th a B\u2081, the 51st an A\u2082, and so on. P is the 15th letter in the alphabet without I, and there were 113 rounds before this one, so P\u2081\u2081\u2083 indicates that our asteroid was the (113*25+15 = 2840) 2840th asteroid discovered in its half month of the first half of November 2012.\n\nNow, we can look up the precise date of the discovery. It was the 5th of November 2012. Meaning, in the first five days of this half-month they had already discovered several thousands of new asteroids, and that was over ten years ago. Astronomers are really good at discovering new asteroids.",

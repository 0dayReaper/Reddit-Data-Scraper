It's eliminating polling places which causes long lines and now voting isnt a 5 minute in and out thing like in the burbs or rural areas it's a multi hour ordeal. It's making early voting only available on certain days and times which disproportionately impacts lower socioeconomic brackets and their ability to cast a ballot when they're able. Like if the government gave everyone a federal ID and was like cool you're good to vote there are plenty of things in place to suppress the vote in progressive bastions.",

Go to the poverty finance sub and you can see people trying to find out how to make small amounts of money like $30 buy enough food to last two weeks. $30 isn't much to me now, but there was a time in my life where $30 would have seemed like a $1k and there's people out there who would feel the same now.\n\nSome people are either very delusional how poor some people really are, or they just don't want those people to vote and are too chicken shit to admit it.",

Of course, Obama won Harris by less than a thousand votes in 2012 and Biden net 200,000+ votes eight years later. Give it a few more cycles.\n \nCorrection: San Antonio is the second biggest city. Austin is the 4th largest, but is the bluest.",

Therefore every year more people retire than enter job market. \n5. Large number of people left Poland after 2004 (when we entered eu).\n\n\nWhat that means is that we have growing demand for workers coupled with low supply. Thus the unemployment rate is down. What is also important to note is that a lot of these factors influence the youngest workers. That is crucial because people in that age group usually suffer from unemployed the most. Policy wise we also have tax breaks for workers under the age of 26, so it's cheaper to hire someone young for the employer and the young employee pays less taxes, so that don't die earning minimal wage.",

            "comment": "Someone in r/linguistics requested that I include the names of specific languages, so I added them both the current map and--to illustrate the displacement as well as the reduction of language areas--included \\*only\\* currently-spoken individual languages by name on the pre-Columbian map.  \n\n\nIn the course of so doing, I figured out that the indigenous languages spoken in the LA area likely aren't Uto-Aztecan but those spoken by immigrants from southern Mexico and Guatemala: Oto-Manguean (Mixteco, which has a big population in Bakersfield; Zapotec; Chimantec) and Mayan (K'iche).  There are a couple others--Mixe (a Totozoquean language, possibly related to  now-extinct Chitimachan, the indigenous language of the New Orleans area) plus a decent-sized Navajo population in LA--but in the interest of readability I kept it to the two most common ones.    \n\n\nFinally, added the additional dab of Chimakuan on the east side of the Olympic peninsula to represent now-extinct Chimakum.",

And I think everyone from the US will find it interesting. After all, just a few hundred years ago, everyone spoke these languages where we live(and we can still learn about them today!).",

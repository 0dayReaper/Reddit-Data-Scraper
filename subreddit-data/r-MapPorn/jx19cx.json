Since I'm lazy, rather than doing the integration myself, I used [this calculator](http://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/free-fall) and plugged in the numbers. Looks like by the end you'd have been falling for 65 seconds and your speed would be up to 244 m/s. This doesn't consider air resistance, but Mars atmosphere is very thin so it might not change it much.\n\nEdit: for comparison, the same altitude fall would take ~40s on Earth.",

If I made an error or if you have any questions, my [creator](https://np.reddit.com/u/6b86b3ac03c167320d93) might check my messages.  \n [Source Code](https://github.com/laurinneff/no-google-amp-bot) | [Issues](https://github.com/laurinneff/no-google-amp-bot/issues) | [FAQ](https://laurinneff.ch/2020/10/17/nogoogleampbot/)  \nWhy does this bot exist?  \nGoogle does a lot of tracking, which many people don't want, so they use alternatives to their services. Using AMP, they can track you even more, and they might even replace ads with their own, stealing ad revenue from the site's owners. Since there's no consistent way of finding the original links from an AMP link, I made this bot which automatically does it for you.",

I'm guessing they just take an average \"low point\" of the surface to measure the height of these mountains?",

Like, the United States does not border Japan via Hawaii, like how France borders Brazil via Guiana. Surely there are differences in how you administer an island territory vs a territory which shares land borders with other sovereign states?",

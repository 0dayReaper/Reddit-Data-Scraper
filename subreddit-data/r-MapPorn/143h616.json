I remember hearing that once in junior high after knowing for a fact that there are 4 oceans, and I thought \u201cwow, where\u2019d they find the 5th one?\u201d\n\nI also read two years ago that we discovered an 8th continent!\n\nI thought with the invention of the internet that the world was getting smaller, but maybe that\u2019s not the case.",

Clearly all the oceans are a single body of water, but the existing names are useful as they relate to the continents (i.e. an American can think of 'Atlantic' to encompass American-European relations and 'Pacific' to talk of American-East Asian relations).\n\nFrom the perspective of human geography, it has no practical value as a designation. From a hydrographic perspective, is it useful?",

There is a strong current that completely encircles Antarctica, making the water there both chemically and biogeographically separate from any other body of water. Despite the landmasses separating them all the other oceans flow into each other, and thus really lack any traits that would give any of them a unique identity apart from where they are relative to land",

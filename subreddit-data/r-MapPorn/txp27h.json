And how could Russia hold down Europe, and make a massive assault on the US at the same time?\n\nThey don't have the infrastructure in place for a true blue water navy. And even if they did, the US coastal defenses are absurd. You'd have to somehow make a landing, without the US knowing, which they can see you coming from thousands of miles away.\n\nThe oceans are the USs greatest natural barrier, it'd be nearly impossible even if the American army wasn't absurdly powerful. The US civilian base is even well armed.\n\nI get that it's fiction, but I can only suspend my disbelief so far. Like it's so out of the realm of possibility it's stupid.\n\nThe US couldn't even do that to Russia or China and they DO have a blue water navy and forces they could deploy.",

So in order to take the east coast in a matter of.. days..\n\nThey'd have to take every beach head on the entire eastern seaboard at the same time. From Maine to Florida. Which would take millions of troops, which would take I don't even know how many thousands of ships..\n\nThen they'd have to immediately destroy every resistance and move hundreds of miles inland. Then stop, retreat, go back and shortly after do the same thing in Europe..\n\nEven if they invaded the US with ten million troops they'd still struggle against the geography, and the you know.. 120 or so million people that live in the red.\n\nLike it's so far beyond far fetched. I'd have at least made it so they found ultra powerful alien cyborg tech or something. Then I'd be like, okay I can see that, they've got the power of aliens on their side.",

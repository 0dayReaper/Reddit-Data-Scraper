So please just stop spamming \\*Constantinople every time you see the word \"Istanbul\"\n\n\nIt isn't since that wasn't the commonly used name of the city back then. If you disregard the example of Istanbul, it should be pretty clear. It is the battle of Stalingrad not Volgograd, siege of Leningrad not Petrograd or St Petersburg, it is the city and battle of troy not hisarlik, etc., etc. \n\n\n\nThe only reason some Turks have an aversion to the name is because Greek fascist refuse to use the new names of some Turkish cities, namely trabzon, istanbul and izmir, and want to, or at least say they want to, conquer them. \n\n\nHowever using the correct name for the time period is at least never incorrect and is usually the best way to refer to something.",

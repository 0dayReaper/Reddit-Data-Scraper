This was the same type of rice brought to Madagascar.\n\nWest Africans didn't domesticate their local variety of rice (Oryza glaberrima) until around 3,000 years ago, and today, African rice is quickly being replaced in African markets by Asian rice because African rice yields less food.",

Heck, Swahili is spoken in Northern Madagascar while it does not exist in Mauritius at all.  \nThere are a lot of similarities between Madagascar and its Eastern African neighbors than there are between Mauritius and its Eastern African neighbors. However, Mauritius is becoming East Africanized in part because just like itself, some of the neighboring East African nations have large Asian populations(in addition to South Africa) so through them, they are slowly linking to the mainland. For example, a lot of Kenyan corporations are incorporated in Mauritius these days.  \nMadagascar despite having a largely Austronesian population does have a lot of similarities to its neighbors because it still has a large mixed and African population from East Africa.",

I wonder if they mean cooked or dry, that's a ton of dry rice for a person to consume.\n\nEdit: looking it up online,  dry rice is typically a third of the weight of cooked rice. So if this map is saying nearly a pound of dry rice is consumed by every person in Madagascar, that's saying that they're eating nearly 3 pounds of cooked rice per day. On *average*, meaning some would be much higher.\n\nI'm 6'6\", I can put down 5-6000 calories a day no problem, but 3 pounds of rice per day sounds like a fckin challenge.\n\nLil skeptical of all this.",

Little is known about the mechanisms of spreading innovative ideas in past societies. Here we investigate how well the spread of Christianity can be explained as a diffusive process constrained by physical travel in the Roman Empire. First, we combine a previously established model of the transportation network with city population estimates and evaluate to which extent the spatio-temporal pattern of the spread of Christianity can be explained by static factors. Second, we apply a network-theoretical approach to analyze the spreading process utilizing effective distance. We show that the spread of Christianity in the first two centuries closely follows a gravity-guided diffusion, and is substantially accelerated in the third century. Using the effective distance measure, we are able to suggest the probable path of the spread. Our work demonstrates how the spatio-temporal patterns we observe in the data can be explained using only spatial constraints and urbanization structure of the empire. Our findings also provide a methodological framework to be reused for studying other cultural spreading phenomena.",

The biggest number of Muslims in Al-Andalus was in 1050, after the fall of the Caliphate in 1031.\n\nThe territories south of the Duero were part of the Caliphate, a semi-cohesive entity, for 300 years, and the people under them were Christians that slowly converted to Islam. It's just a big coincidence that the biggest number of Muslims coincided with the fall of that same Caliphate, and the subsequent Christian conquests. \n\nIt's easier to conquer divided taifas than a unified kingdom. Just because those territories were quickly conquered by Christians doesn't mean they were mostly Muslim, because they had been under Muslim rule for four centuries, and people tend to adapt. Those same Muslims would convert to Christianity in a few centuries. \n\nEverything north of the Duero was not important to Cordoba. So those territories were left, semi-abandoned, and that was used by the Christians in their favour. And Aragon was not fully conquered till the 13th century. El Cid stayed in Zaragoza when it was still under Muslim rule, and that happened in the 12th century.",

Just as it's cringy that some people say Islam has always been peaceful, and those Christian Crusaders were \"colonizers\" (for defending / trying to take back the Holy Land, which the Muslims took by force from the Christian East Roman Empire). It's just as cringy to say, without evidence, that the pre-Islamic inhabitants of the Levant or Egypt were massacred, which goes against all evidence. *Sometimes* \\-not always- societies undergo religious shifts, and sometimes they undergo linguistic shifts as as well. Was the Islamization of Egypt peaceful?  No; it was an expansion by war. Was it genocide? There is no evidence of that. The Islamic Caliphate wanted to rule and convert people; the concept of ethnic \"others\" and wiping them out doesn't appear to be present here.",

And you know it\u2019s absolutely intellectually dishonest to say otherwise.\n\n\u201cWhy Have Some People Adopted BCE/CE? An important reason for adopting BCE/CE is religious neutrality. Since the Gregorian calendar has superseded other calendars to become the international standard, members of non-Christian groups may object to the explicitly Christian origins of BC and AD.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Does CE Stand For? CE stands for \u201cCommon Era.\u201d It refers to the same years as AD does, just in a more secular way. The year 2022 CE is the same year as 2022 AD. The Gregorian calendar, which is the dating system we use to measure years today, was created by a pope of the Catholic Church.\u201d\n\n\u201cProponents of the Common Era notation assert that the use of BCE/CE shows sensitivity to those who use the same year numbering system as the one that originated with and is currently used by Christians, but who are not themselves Christian.\u201d\n\n^ the first three results when you search \u201cwhy do people use CE instead of AD?\u201d\n\nStop being obtuse.

Famous Irish monks were Columbanus, who founded numerous monasteries on the continent, and Columba, who introduced Christianity to Scotland. Some time ago I had also heard from a historian on YouTube that Celtic Christianity was perhaps also influenced by the earlier Druidic religion, but I wouldn't put my finger on it.\n\nThe Irish monks, however, contributed to the re-Christianisation of England, so much so that in the following centuries from England came such figures as Bede the Venerable, a famous historian, or Boniface, born Wynfrith, who made the greatest contribution to the Christianisation of Germany.",

Sure, we cannot prove Jesus existed and walked on water, but the cultural, historical, and political context in the New Testament is accurate. Whereas Mormonism, written in the 19th century, gives history lessons (*human* history, not the creation of the universe) about millenia, that can be easily disproven.\n\n(The Old Testament gets fuzzier, but a lot of that is treated as allegorical by Christians today).\n\nDoes the way I described Mormonism also define Scientology?  I have a little familiarity with the basic tenets of Scientology.  But does it also provide human history that can be disproven?\n\nA second question is: were Christianity *and* Islam filling some sort of void that polytheistic and animist societies were looking to fill, a situation that cannot be replicated today or in the upcoming centuries?",

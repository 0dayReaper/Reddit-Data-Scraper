            "comment": "Nice fact for those who are into this stuff: South Korea\u2019s authoritarian rule ended largely thanks to the blue area near Gwangju, due to an uprising. Until the mid to late 1980s, the country wasn\u2019t really a full democracy. (The left and right wing divide in the southwest and southeast isn\u2019t a new thing.)\n\nThere is a good movie called \u201cA Taxi Driver\u201d about this, starring Song Kang-ho, who played the poor family\u2019s dad in \u201cParasite.\u201d",

What does the left in Korea actually stand for? Serious answers please.",

Looking at the map in wiki for the 2022 South Korean presidential election, Lee Jae-Myung carried over 90% of the vote in Cholla (the southwest). Over 90% is just unreal, like I have never seen that level of regional support for a candidate in a free and fair election anywhere... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Okay, just checked, Biden won 92% of the vote in Washington DC in 2020, but DC is kind of a tiny slice of a place while Cholla is a full blown region with 5 million plus people, like a mid-sized American state.)",

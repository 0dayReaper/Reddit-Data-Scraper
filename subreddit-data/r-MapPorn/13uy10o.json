Tiberius did exile His successor Caligula there though. I don't think Tiberius ever exiled Nero there considering the latter was born 9 months after Tiberius' death.",

AD 6\u201331) was the adopted grandson and heir of the Roman Emperor Tiberius, was exiled to island of Ponza. and this Nero was never an emperor.  \n2 diffent Tiberiuses and Neros,  \n**The fact above is totally wrong, thanks for noticing**  \nbut map is accurate :)",

The big difference I'm seeing is that the Soviet claims didn't include Erzincan.",

The actual reason why Russians focused so much on Turkey after the WW2 was the Bosphorus strait which is the only entrance to the Black Sea. The Soviet army controlled Bulgaria after the WW2 and was just 150km from Istanbul, once the war was started, their main goal was to take Bosphorus and make the Black Sea fleet able to enter the world ocean without anyone controlling the entrance.\n\nThe fears the USSR gets Bosphorus were also the reason why Turkey was able to join NATO so fast. Remember, initial rules of NATO wouldnt allow Turkey to join, NATO had to change its treaty to make it happen.",

In the XIX century the excuse was that they want to save Orthodox brothers in Balkans from Muslim overlords.\n\nFunny part is Russia was about to get the strait for basically free in the WW1 if not the Bolshevick revolution. They just needed to wait till the West wins the war and participate in post-war treaties. Then, with Russians involved, Ataturk wouldnt be able to reorganize the Turkish army and state the way he did it(with help from the USSR, btw!).",

All serious documentation could only be made in Russian, which means that all educated workers had to work in Russian languages. In fact, higher education was available only in Russian. Even in western Ukraine, you could only study in the university in Russian language. Movies were only available in Russian language. All cities were heavily russificized.\n\nThe USSR only promoted the Ukrainian culture in the 1920s, after that it was just pure Russification.",

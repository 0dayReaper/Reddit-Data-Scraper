They dehumanized others and in the process had to shed something of their decency and humanity.\n\nFor Jewish Holocaust survivors, the question \u201cHow could this have been allowed to happen to us?\u201d is haunting. Equally haunting is the German \u201cHow could we have done this?\u201d Both questions could be reworded as \u201cWhy did God leave us?\u201d\n\nYou take that and then add the Communist regime, which suppresses religion and does not offer redemption to the Individual, and it sounds like perfect breeding ground for a secular/non religious society.\n\nWhy are Poles and Ukrainians, having been under Communist regimes for the same time or even longer much more religious than East Germany? Even under many years of oppression, they do not believe God left them.\n\nFor West Germany, the Marshall Plan allowed them to recover from their destruction in WW2. The economic progress and liberating Western influence allowed them to return to and retain their traditional Christian faith.\n\nI\u2019m no historian, but this is my take on explaining how history and understanding the human condition could explain the religiosity difference between East and West Germany.",

Stalin's USSR did this during the height of its paranoia, but even that was episodic; in the DDR, it was a constant drumbeat.\n\nThat reporting culture helped shatter community bonds and generate anomie (that's a technical term). Broken community bonds, plus a government actively invested in secularism, is what caused it.",

After 1956 they became openly friendly with those criminals, and introduced religion indoctrination sessions in public schools, which are in the curriculum to this day - most of their \"secularism\" and fights with the church was since then theatrical, like \"controversially\" not allowing the church to build some new churches (without closing the older ones)\n\nIn modern poland the media is frequently astonished that the west is more hostile to the church than the communist regime was, that should be enough said",

Nazis didn\u2019t perceive themselves or their actions as evil. They\u2018d go home and have fund with their families after work. \nAnd if you think dehumanizing others would lead to lack of religion, religion would\u2019ve ceased to exist a while ago or do you think Medieval Christians weren\u2019t dehumanizing people constantly?\nBtw just based on reputation East Germany is a lot more friendly, hospitable and with a greater sense of community. If you run out if sugar while baking you rather wanna be in the East then the West.\n\nThe real and only reason for that lack of Religion in the area was because being Christian in the GDR could actively harm your future as the government didn\u2019t like it. So many Christians kept it to themselves and didn\u2019t teach it to their kids. So these kids wouldn\u2019t teach it to theirs either obviously and now you have a lot of Atheists that are Atheist because they simply grew up without Religion",

A lot of people in China might practice elements of Taoism, Confucianism, Mahayana Buddhism, and Chinese Folk Religion all at the same time, some might do this while still maintaining that they're irreligious.  None of this is perceived as contradictory since these religions are mostly perceived as just being parts of Chinese culture that complement each other.  In Japan you can replace the Chinese Folk Religion and (mostly) the Taoism with Shinto and you've got a similar situation.  In Korea, Confucianism, Mahayana Buddhism and Korean Shamanism often get mixed up, though there's also a much more substantial Christian population there (many of whom retain some Confucian and Shamanistic practices since they're perceived as philosophical or cultural rather than exclusively religious).  Same deal with Vietnam.  Religion is more complicated than it's usually credited with everywhere, but it gets especially complicated in East Asia.",

Obviously Shinto, Taoism, Chinese Folk Religion, Korean Shamanism, and Vietnamese Folk Religion are all very distinct from each other but these four countries share Confucian and Mahayana Buddhist traditions which blend in similar ways with more unique local traditions.

It's about actively practicing and/or identifying with more than one distinct religion simultaneously.  As you say, some people celebrate Easter and Christmas without calling themselves Christian or call themselves Christian without really believing in it, but there are very few people in Europe who would simultaneously call themselves both Christian and Muslim, while in Asia being both Taoist and Confucian or both Shinto and Buddhist is commonplace.  \n\nThere's even a motif in traditional Chinese art known as the Three Sages, where Confucius, the Buddha, and Laotze (Also sometimes transliterated as Lao Tzu or Laozi, legendary founder of Taoism) are represented as three old men hanging out together in various contexts. One specific version of this trope is called The Vinegar Tasters, where the three of them are sitting around a pot of vinegar and the expression on their faces after tasting it illustrates their teachings' attitudes toward the world.  In that one, Confucius is represented with a puckered face, reacting to the sour flavor because Confucianism views the world as sour and in need of correction through strictly followed rules. Buddha reacts as if the vinegar is not sour but bitter, because Buddhism sees the world as essentially a place of suffering that we must find a way out of through the achievement of Nirvana.  Laotze has a smile on his face because he perceives the sweetness in the vinegar and Taoism is more positive about the world than the other two.  Some interpret the motif as being mostly about illustrating the differences between the religions, but it's fairly common to interpret it as saying that all three are correct and that following all three leads to a balanced view of the world.  \n\nIt goes without saying that this is a very different dynamic from the way religion is perceived in the West. You're not going to walk into a Western Christian's home and find a painting on the wall showing Jesus, Muhammed, and Zoroaster breaking bread together.",

There are three separate censuses, one in Scotland, one in NI, and one that covers both England and Wales. In 2021 a census took place in NI and in England &amp; Wales, but the Scottish Government chose to delay their census until 2022 due to Covid and consequently the Scottish results have yet to be published. \n\nThe results from Northern Ireland and England &amp; Wales have been published. The NI census allowed people to record Catholic, Presbyterian Church in Ireland, Church of Ireland (Anglicanism), Methodist Church in Ireland, Other Christian, Other Religion,  or No Religion, with a write in option for those choosing Other Christian or Other Religion, so the type of data on this map might be mapped from the 2021 NI census. However, the only options for the E&amp;W census were Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, Other Religion or No Religion and only those who answered \"Other Religion\" had a write-in option). The map, on the other hand, shows varying levels of Protestantism in England &amp; Wales plus a few areas of irreligion and a few of Catholicism so it shows data that is simply not available from the 2021 E&amp;W Census\n\n[https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/religion/bulletins/religionenglandandwales/census2021](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/religion/bulletins/religionenglandandwales/census2021)\n\n[https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/census-2021-main-statistics-religion-tables](https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/census-2021-main-statistics-religion-tables)",

I did wonder if there were any local authorities in England where Muslims or Hindus were the largest single religious group in terms of the available options in the 2021 Census and checked some of the obvious contenders. In fact, Hindus are not the single largest group in Leicester, nor are Muslims the largest single group in Bradford (although it's close). The only one I could find where Christian or No Religion were not the largest individual group was Tower Hamlets, where it was Muslim, and there might in fact be a green dot in the East London area, but the scale is too small to really see. (Figures are all in the link in my previous post).\n\nHowever, my point is not that I think the map is baseless with regard to the UK, just that the previous poster can't be correct in their assumption that the UK data is based on the most recent census. It may well accurately reflect the stats the OP used - I just don't know what those stats are. FWIW,  I suspect there are only a handful of areas in England where Catholics are a plurality, so the map doesn't look wrong to me as long as the stats are somewhat older. However, the 2021 census shows No Religion is the plurality in more areas than the map seems to suggest and on that basis I'd say it's out of date.",

The only group that would have taken longer to input was Other Religion as that required a write in, but that only applied for the 1% or so of residents who couldn't record one of the fixed options of Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, or No Religion.",

Then Islam spread through North Africa and through the Middle East.                                          \n\n\nThere was persecution in Iran to replace their original religion (*Zoroastrianism*) with Islam. Afghanistan, Pakistan and Indonesian were all Hindu or Buddhist but then became muslim. Many statues of the Buddha were destroyed. I saw videos of muslims in India trying to take over Hindu temples and breaking statues of Hindu gods. There are conflicts between muslims and Hindus now.                                      \n\n\nChristianity forced itself on the world through the Roman Empire. Persecution against other religions (*Pagans*) was done under Theodosius and anti-gay laws were enforced and spread. As Rome collapsed, christian European empires arose, trying to colonize the world and spread christianity to replace other religions and spread anti-gay laws around the world.                                  \n\n\n\nIt makes sense that those two Abrahamic religions became so powerful. They are the religions that took over governments and force themselves on others through colonizing, doing forced conversions, and killing those who won't convert so that their slaves can pass the religion down through generations. Their governments claimed that they were doing colonizing and genocide for \"*the one true God*\".",

They are the same religion, just different denominations/sects.     \n\n\nIslam is a different religion that promotes belief in a new book that they see as superior to the bible (*Quran*) along with other writings that christians don't believe in (*Hadiths*).                   \n\n\n\nJudaism has the old testament (*Tanakh/Torah*) but rejects the christian new testament and muslim Quran.                     \n\n\n\nThey are all Abrahamic (*god of Moses*) religions, but they are 3 different religions. christians (*whether Catholic or Protestant or Orthodox*) believe in the old and new testament with Jesus as the son of God, while muslims believe in Muhammad as the greatest prophet with the Quran being the supreme book, while Jewish people believe in Moses as the greatest prophet without Quran and New Testament.",

But written by many many different writers. \nOf course the Jews don't consider Jesus the son of god. He didn't exist around the time (100 BCE). And when the bible was assembled, in the fourth century CE. the stories were told though, when the Quran was written. \n\nAlso, the contents of the bibles also differ. The Catholic old testament contains more books than the protestant bible. Also the Eastern Orthodox and Ethiopian Orthodox have different contents. [YouTube link](https://youtu.be/HYlZk4Hv-E8) At 25:38 there's an interesting concept on which one of the Judaistic religions switched to Christianity. \n\nBack to the topic; what I tried to state is that there are a lot of resemblances in the Abrahamic religions, but a lot of differences as well. Same goes for the religions within Christianity. There are so many denominations today, that for a detailed map it should be okay to distinguish.",

They were using caissons to construct it. Basically if you put enough air pressure in a box it will keep the water out. But the workers started getting sick, they were getting the bends. The new chief engineer doesn't think this is real, gets the bends and almost dies and is bedridden. Second story, said engineer realizes that he cannot guarantee the quality of the steel wires for the cables. He just says fuck it and doubled the amount of wires per cable from the original plans",

Certainly more than zero, but there's a strong trend for NIMBYs to call any old building \"historical\" when there's no true value in that building.\n\nThe building for the local church in my town could easily be from the 19th century (I cannot find any record from a quick and lazy search). There is zero, zilch, and no cultural value to the age of that building. It's not special. It's not the last remnant of a special kind of architecture. It's not an artistic design. Nothing important happened there. It doesn't represent anything. There's no value behind its age, unlike e.g. the Paul Revere house. All it is, is old.\n\nHow many of those \"historic\" churches are actually in that bucket? Old but lacking historical significance to that age? I'd dare say it's the overwhelming majority of them.\n\nWe need housing more than we need old churches.",

New York had the luxury of being planned almost from the very start to be grid based. It was the major trading hub of the New World and got a lot of organizational support from back home.\n\nCompare NYC to Boston, which is slightly older but more importantly grew naturally over time without much concerted planning effort. It looks a lot more like London - winding streets, asymmetric intersections, roundabouts, etc.",

It still has soil issues today, actually. Initially it was a site of nice middle class housing, but then the poor fill job became apparent, so one of the reasons it was a poor neighborhood at the time of Gangs of New York is that the buildings and streets were literally sinking into the ground because they didn't adequately plug up the springs that fed the pond. They also buried a lot of vegetation that produced methane and the standing water led to mosquitoes and malaria.",

It's useful for getting the feel of the place and what goes on there. Satellite imagery or geometric projections aren't the only way to render a map nor the be-all and end-all perspective. Maps and artistry have been linked since the first maps were drawn. You don't have to be so bold as to think any depiction of a human place or natural landscape is a map, but this work is definitely far from being \"not a map.\"",

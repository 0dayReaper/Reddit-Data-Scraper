It also lubricates the bit, cleans the cuttings from the hole, and stops the hole collapsing on itself. If the well flows uncontrollably that's what's called a blowout.\n\nWhen the \"pay zone\" is reached we'll pull out, and a final section of casing is run and cemented.\n\nThen the process of \"completion\" begins. They'll displace the dense mud with a less dense \"completion fluid\" before running smaller diameter tubing in, [isolate it with packers](https://www.slb.com/-/media/images/insights/oilfield-review/pdf-03151-02-hi-res.ashx?h=856&amp;w=502&amp;la=en&amp;hash=374F5849DB1F2FA0495C2ED6C503EE57) so the oil will flow up the tubing and not the casing, and install valves and control equipment on the surface. At this point the well is still isolated by the casing and should not flow unless there's a major fuckup like Deepwater Horizon. Then run a perforating \"gun\" to shoot tiny holes through the casing, cement, and reservoir (different from fracking) and expose it. \n\nBecause the fluid inside the well is at a lower pressure than the oil in the reservoir the oil will start to flow out and up the tubing. They'll let the oil flow for a couple days to clean up, and then the well will be fully operational.\n\nIdeally the reservoir should be at a high enough pressure that the oil will flow without \"artifical lift\" for a couple years. \n\n[Here's an ancient but very detailed video on how the whole process of drilling and completing a well works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBty_TqyXcQ)\n\nEdit: I may have gotten the completion steps in the wrong order because it's beyond my pay grade but you'll have a rough idea how it works",

You do go down in the same cage as the miners and walk 2km to the lab  through the main drift. Everything around the lab itself is   overbuilt to withstand essentially anything that comes its way.",

The gist of it was that after digging really deep basements with very heavy diggers, way way under street level, the driver just parks his faithful digger at the bottom and gets lifted out. They fill in the concrete base around and above the digger.  It was really sad.  One of the numerous shows with people like Bill Bailey, Ross Noble etc.  I do tend to anthropomorphize inert objects, especially ones that drive, like the Mars Rovers. Wish I could find that again.",

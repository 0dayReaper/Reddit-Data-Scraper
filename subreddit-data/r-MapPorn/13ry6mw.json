I will stand by my India placement, especually because their biggest competitor, China, and their biggest enemy, Pakistan, are both on the enemy side so they have large incentive to join NATO allies. Jordan I'm sure I'm wrong about because I know nothing about that country.",

As for military practices it currently only has maneuvers with NATO. \n\nIt would be neutral rather than joining any side. Its not connected with any CSTO member and would be a suicide if it decided to join it since it is surrounded by NATO members",

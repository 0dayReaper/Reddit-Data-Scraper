They're still red at their core. However, Georgia politics has always been a weird dark red with a casual, non-aggressive demeanor. Well-educated suburbanites have usually been more after tax cuts and a pro-business environment over social causes usually pushed by rural America.\n\nThe personality differences between Kemp (GA) and DeSantis (FL) make alot of sense to me.",

Some of that might just be that Biden, being from the area had more appeal than Hillary.\n\nBut I suspect some of it is that Trump 2016 was very focused on immigration and not so much the culture wars beyond immigration. His initial fan base really was relatively unreligious northeastern right wingers (Chris Christie really pioneered this kind of more in your face politics at the national level) But within his term Trump really began to suck up to Evangelicals and didnt mention immigration nearly so much.\n\nSo that likely got him some support among religious Hispanics, but lost him support among more secular whites (which the Northeast has many of).",

It's interesting to correlate with another comment on this thread talking about loosing secular Northeasterns but gaining religious Hispanics. So the map might give off the impression that central Texas is more Democratic than south Texas which couldn't be farther from the truth.",

Progressives were the only ones pushing Biden to do something in those areas (remember all the negotiations for Build Back Better that failed because they were sabotaged by centrists/moderates and we got next to none of it). I get the hate for Dems though, since Dems in general have gotten nothing done on big things since Biden got elected, except maybe infrastructure and climate change, but not soooo much else. It\u2019s just\u2026that\u2019s not because of their progressive wing. \n\nIt\u2019s not like the centrists we\u2019re saying \u201cno build back better unless you &lt;insert social thing they really don\u2019t like&gt; and we\u2019ll give you &lt;insert economic priorities - education, taxes on corporations, capital gains, the wealthy to pay down debt, drug prices,\u2026&gt;\u201d and Progressives refused. Progressives asked/begged repeatedly for those things and moderates said no. The moderates and centrists weren\u2019t open to any of that. And if they agreed on drug prices, childcare, education, taxes on the wealthy to kill the deficit, I don\u2019t see Progressives just refusing to work with/vote with someone who they disagree with strongly on social issues. They just got rolled/overwhelmed. I don\u2019t see Republicans doing much on any of these issues either though, save maybe immigration, especially given how they are even more obsessed with social issues right now (I mean, DeSantis is making it his entire campaign basically). Likely they will pass more tax cuts benefitting almost exclusively the rich, running up the debt (they did w/Bush and Trump at least), but I don\u2019t see them tackling health care costs, really tackling the debt, cost of college or training for the various trades, etc. Heck, the child tax credit being allowed to expire was hugely bad for parents financially, but Republicans and moderate Dems wanted to end it, unlike Progressives, but they got rolled/overwhelmed and it expired. I don\u2019t see Republicans putting it back. I hope some blue state progressives will find a way to re-implement it through state taxes in their own states.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m curious how things have gotten worse for you all in Maryland too. I\u2019m not from the area, but what specifically? Where I\u2019m at in Ohio things are worse, but mostly as just a continuation of things that we\u2019re getting worse under Obama and Trump too.

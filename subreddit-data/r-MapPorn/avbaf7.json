Depends on what your interests are.\n\nAncient historical sites? Shiraz, Esfehan, Yazd,...\n\nBreathtaking nature? Anywhere North or West of Iran.\n\nDiving and swimming? Coastline of the Persian gulf, Kish, Qeshm.\n\nDeserts and dunes and off-road driving? Anywhere in the middle.\n\nThe list goes on, I'm sure a simple google search will give you enough info. If you ever decided to come and had questions or wanted a companion you can DM me. There are nice people on the couchsurfer site too if you want to save some more money. Hotels are cheaper and nicer than other countries tho.\n\nEdit: added swimming",

I recently met a polish girl on a trip and she was having a good time. She did have a polish guy with him tho. \n\nWe had some smuggled whiskey with us and they were delighted to have some drink after staying in Iran for two weeks. \n\nSo yeah, another negative point is the no legal alcohol thing.\n\nEdit: a word",

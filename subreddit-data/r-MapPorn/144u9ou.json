I would say that Maine(4), Michigan(16), Wisconsin(10), Nevada(6), and Arizona(11) are the most likely to pass this, out of the states that are pending. That would get it to 242 electoral votes. It's still not enough.\n\nIt's odd that New Hampshire(4), Pennsylvania(20), and Virginia(13) aren't pending. Those states have trended more liberal than the country as a whole. They would be enough to get above 270.",

            "comment": "The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC) is an agreement among a group of U.S. states and the District of Columbia to award all their electoral votes to whichever presidential ticket wins the overall popular vote in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The compact was drafted in 2006 and has continued to gain support. The compact is designed to ensure that the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide is elected president, and it would come into effect only when it would guarantee that outcome.  There have been 5 instances of elections in which the popular vote winner lost, which this coalition is attempting to prevent. As of June\u00a02023, it has been adopted by sixteen states and the District of Columbia. These jurisdictions have 205 electoral votes, which is 38% of the Electoral College and 76% of the 270 votes needed to give the compact legal force. The threshold for activation (270 votes) only needs 65 more electoral votes which could be completed in as little as 3 more states ratifying this coalition.\n\nThe goal of this coalition is to bypass a constitutional amendment to modify the enshrined electoral collage that has been used for the countries entire history. Once in effect, in each presidential election the participating states would award all of their electoral votes to the candidate with the largest national popular vote total across the 50 states and the District of Columbia. As a result, that candidate would win the presidency by securing a majority of votes in the Electoral College. Until the compact's conditions are met, all states award electoral votes in their current manner.\n\nCertain legal questions may affect implementation of the compact. Some legal observers believe states have plenary power to appoint electors as prescribed by the compact; others believe that the compact will require congressional consent under the Constitution's Compact Clause or that the presidential election process cannot be altered except by a constitutional amendment.",

                    "comment": "The 2020 Supreme Court unanimously reaffirmed the power of states over their electoral votes, before elections begin.\r  \n\r  \nThe decision held that the power of the legislature under Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution is \u201cfar reaching\u201d and it conveys the \u201cthe broadest power of determination over who becomes an elector.\u201d This is consistent with 130 years of Supreme Court jurisprudence.\r  \n\n\nMaine (in 1969) and Nebraska (in 1992) chose not to have statewide winner-take-all laws\n\nAs a result of changes in state laws enacted since 1789, the people have the right to vote for presidential electors in 100% of the states, there are no property requirements for voting in any state, and the state-by-state winner-take-all method is used by 48 of the 50 states. States can, and have, changed their method of awarding electoral votes over the years. \n\nIn 1789, in the nation's first election, a majority of the states appointed their presidential electors by appointment by the legislature or by the governor and his cabinet, the people had no vote for President in most states, and in states where there was a popular vote, only men who owned a substantial amount of property could vote, and only three states used the state-by-state winner-take-all method to award electoral votes (and all three stopped using it by 1800).\r  \n  \nIn the nation\u2019s first presidential election in 1789 and second election in 1792, the states employed a wide variety of methods for choosing presidential electors, including\r  \n\u25cf appointment of the state\u2019s presidential electors by the Governor and his Council, \r  \n\u25cf appointment by both houses of the state legislature, \t\t\t\r  \n\u25cf popular election using special single-member presidential-elector districts, \r  \n\u25cf popular election using counties as presidential-elector districts, \t\t\r  \n\u25cf popular election using congressional districts, \t\t\t\r  \n\u25cf popular election using multi-member regional districts, \t\r  \n\u25cf combinations of popular election and legislative choice, \t\t\t\r  \n\u25cf appointment of the state\u2019s presidential electors by the Governor and his Council combined with the state legislature, and\r  \n\u25cf statewide popular election. \t\t\t\t\t\r  \n  \nThe current statewide winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes is not in the U.S. Constitution. It was not debated at the Constitutional Convention. It is not mentioned in the Federalist Papers. It was not the Founders\u2019 choice. It was used by only three states in 1789, and all three of them repealed it by 1800. It is not entitled to any special deference based on history or the historical meaning of the words in the U.S. Constitution. The actions taken by the Founding Fathers make it clear that they never gave their imprimatur to the winner-take-all method. The state based winner take all system was not adopted by a majority of the states until the 11th presidential election. - decades after the U.S. Constitution was written, after the states adopted it, one-by-one\r  \n  \nThe constitutional wording does not encourage, discourage, require, or prohibit the use of any particular method for awarding a state's electoral votes.\r\n\nThe Interstate Compact on Placement of Children is one of the many interstate compacts that do not require (and never received) congressional consent.\r  \n\r  \nCongressional consent is not required for the National Popular Vote compact under prevailing U.S. Supreme Court rulings. However, because there would undoubtedly be time-consuming litigation about this aspect of the compact, National Popular Vote is working to introduce a bill in Congress for congressional consent.\r  \n\r  \nThe U.S. Constitution provides:\r  \n\"No state shall, without the consent of Congress,\u2026 enter into any agreement or compact with another state\u2026.\"\r  \n\r  \nAlthough this language may seem straight forward, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled, in 1893 and again in 1978, that the Compacts Clause can \"not be read literally.\" In deciding the 1978 case of U.S. Steel Corporation v. Multistate Tax Commission, the Court wrote:\r  \n\"Read literally, the Compact Clause would require the States to obtain congressional approval before entering into any agreement among themselves, irrespective of form, subject, duration, or interest to the United States.\r  \n\r  \n\"The difficulties with such an interpretation were identified by Mr. Justice Field in his opinion for the Court in \\[the 1893 case\\] Virginia v. Tennessee. His conclusion \\[was\\] that the Clause could not be read literally \\[and this 1893 conclusion has been\\] approved in subsequent dicta.\"\r  \n\r  \nSpecifically, the Court's 1893 ruling in Virginia v. Tennessee stated:\r  \n\"Looking at the clause in which the terms 'compact' or 'agreement' appear, it is evident that the prohibition is directed to the formation of any combination tending to the increase of political power in the states, which may encroach upon or interfere with the just supremacy of the United States.\"\r  \n\r  \nThe state power involved in the National Popular Vote compact is specified in Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 the U.S. Constitution:\r  \n\"Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors\u2026.\"\r  \n\r  \nIn the 1892 case of McPherson v. Blacker (146 U.S. 1), the Court wrote:\r  \n\"The appointment and mode of appointment of electors belong exclusively to the states under the constitution of the United States\"\r  \n\r  \nThe National Popular Vote compact would not \"encroach upon or interfere with the just supremacy of the United States\" because there is simply no federal power -- much less federal supremacy -- in the area of awarding of electoral votes in the first place.\r  \n\r  \nIn the 1978 case of U.S. Steel Corporation v. Multistate Tax Commission, the compact at issue specified that it would come into force when seven or more states enacted it. The compact was silent as to the role of Congress. The compact was submitted to Congress for its consent. After encountering fierce political opposition from various business interests concerned about the more stringent tax audits anticipated under the compact, the compacting states proceeded with the implementation of the compact without congressional consent. U.S. Steel challenged the states' action. In upholding the constitutionality of the implementation of the compact by the states without congressional consent, the U.S. Supreme Court applied the interpretation of the Compacts Clause from its 1893 holding in Virginia v. Tennessee, writing that:\r  \n\"the test is whether the Compact enhances state power quaod \\[with regard to\\] the National Government.\"\r  \n\r  \nThe Court also noted that the compact did not\r  \n\"authorize the member states to exercise any powers they could not exercise in its absence.\"",

All you need is a thin and contested margin in a single state with enough electoral votes to make a difference. It's much less likely that the national vote will be close enough that voting irregularities in a single area will swing enough net votes to make a difference. If we'd had National Popular Vote in 2000 or 2016 or 2020, no recount would have been an issue.\r  \n\r  \nThe idea that recounts will be likely and messy with National Popular Vote is distracting. \r  \n\r  \nNo statewide recount, much less a nationwide recount, would have been warranted in any of the nation\u2019s 60  presidential elections if the outcome had been based on the  nationwide count. \r  \n\r  \nThe state-by-state winner-take-all system is not a firewall, but instead causes unnecessary fires.\r  \n\u201cIt\u2019s an arsonist itching to burn down the whole neighborhood by torching a single house.\u201d Hertzberg\r  \n\r  \nThe 2000 presidential election was an artificial crisis created because of Bush's lead of 537 popular votes in Florida. Gore's nationwide lead was 537,179 popular votes (1,000 times larger). Given the minuscule number of votes that are changed by a typical statewide recount (averaging only 274 votes); no one would have requested a recount or disputed the results in 2000 if the national popular vote had controlled the outcome. Indeed, no one (except perhaps almanac writers and trivia buffs) would have cared that one of the candidates happened to have a 537-vote margin in Florida. \r  \n\r  \nRecounts are far more likely in the current system of state by-state winner-take-all methods.\r  \n\r  \nThe possibility of recounts should not even be a consideration in debating the merits of a national popular vote. No one has ever suggested that the possibility of a recount constitutes a valid reason why state governors or U.S. Senators, for example, should not be elected by a popular vote. \r  \n\r  \nThe question of recounts comes to mind in connection with presidential elections only because the current system creates artificial crises and unnecessary disputes. \r  \n\r  \nStatewide   recounts   WERE   rare before the Big Lie of 2020.\r  \nMargin  shifts  are  smaller  in  larger  elections\r  \n\r  \nWe do and would vote state by state. Each state manages its own election and is prepared to conduct a recount. \r  \n\r  \nGiven that before 2020, there had been a recount only once in about 160 statewide elections, and given there is a presidential election once every four years, we expected a recount about once in 640 years with the National Popular Vote. The actual probability of a close national election would be even less than that because recounts are less likely with larger pools of votes. \r  \n\r  \nThe average change in the margin of victory as a result of a statewide recount was a mere 296 votes in a 10-year study of 2,884 elections. \r  \n\r  \nFrom 2000-2019, statewide   recounts  resulted  in  an  average  margin  shift  of  only 430  votes between the frontrunners, representing 0.024% of  the  vote  in  those  elections.\r  \n\r  \nThe common nationwide date for meeting of the Electoral College has been set by federal law as the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December. With both the current system and the National Popular Vote, all counting, recounting, and judicial proceedings must be conducted so as to reach a \"final determination\" prior to the meeting of the Electoral College. In particular, the U.S. Supreme Court has made it clear that the states are expected to make their \"final determination\" six days before the Electoral College meets.\r  \nThe Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022 made the sixth day before the Electoral College meeting into a \u201chard\u201d deadline for states to issue their Certificates of Ascertainment (whereas it was merely a \u201csafe harbor\u201d under the Electoral Count Act of 1787).",

Electors should be awarded proportionally in all states; you could use the same method used to apportion seats in Congress after each Census.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about no candidate getting a majority in the Electoral College, you could make that less likely by restricting the allocation to the top two vote-getters in each state.",

As long as each state treats people within its own borders equally, there is no equal-protection issue\u201d \u2013 Vikram D. Amar\r  \n\r  \nThere is nothing incompatible between differences in state election laws and the concept of a national popular vote for President. That was certainly the mainstream view when the U.S. House of Representatives passed a constitutional amendment in 1969 for a national popular vote by a 338\u201370 margin. That amendment retained state control over elections.\r  \n\r  \nThe 1969 amendment was endorsed by Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and various members of Congress who later ran for Vice President and President such as then-Congressman George H.W. Bush, then-Senator Bob Dole, and then-Senator Walter Mondale. \r  \n\r  \nThe American Bar Association also endorsed the proposed 1969 amendment. \r  \n\r  \nThe proposed 1969 constitutional amendment provided that the popular-vote count from each state would be added up to obtain the nationwide total for each candidate. The National Popular Vote compact does the same. \r  \n\r  \nUnder the current system, the electoral votes from all 50 states are co-mingled and simply added together, irrespective of the fact that the electoral-vote outcome from each state was affected by differences in state policies, including voter registration, ex-felon voting, hours of voting, amount and nature of advance voting, and voter identification requirements. \r  \n\r  \nFederal law requires that each state certify its popular vote count to the federal government (section 6 of Title 3 of the United States Code). \r  \n\t\r  \nUnder both the current system and the National Popular Vote compact, all of the people of the United States are impacted by the different election policies of the states. Everyone in the United States is affected by the division of electoral votes generated by each state.  The procedures governing presidential elections in a closely divided battleground state (e.g., Florida and Ohio) can affect, and indeed have affected, the ultimate outcome of national elections.\r  \n\t\r  \nFor example, the 2000 Certificate of Ascertainment (required by federal law) from the state of Florida reported  2,912,790 popular votes for George W. Bush and 2,912,253 popular vote for Al Gore, and also reported 25 electoral votes for George W. Bush and 0 electoral votes for Al Gore. That 25\u20130 division of the electoral votes from Florida determined the outcome of the national election just as a particular division of the popular vote from a particular state might decisively affect the national outcome in some future election under the National Popular Vote compact. \r  \n\r  \nThe 1969 constitutional amendment, endorsed by Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and members of Congress who later ran for Vice President and President such as then-Congressman George H.W. Bush, then-Senator Bob Dole, and then-Senator Walter Mondale, and The American Bar Association and, more importantly, the current system also accepts the differences among states.",

It'd actually be impossible for every state to conduct a recount because some states do not provide for recounts for elections in any circumstances. Some states also require the margin to be slim (with laws ranging from 1% to only a literal tie), and it's not at all clear that the margin at issue is the nationwide one when only that state will conduct a recount, or that the answer would be the same in every state. I'd be willing to bet that a state not in the compact and whose laws only provide for an automatic recount (no requests), would not be compelled to recount just because some other states are looking at their results.\n\nNot to mention, states can just pass laws making requirements for recounts more stringent if they become so common to be burdensome. And that's not likely considering there have only been two presidential elections where the popular vote margin was less than 0.5%",

If Texas changed to popular-vote electors and a Republican won the popular vote then the Republican would still carry Texas. If they did a congressional-district system then yes, I understand what you're saying.\n\nThe purpose of a popular vote election is already to remove the influence of states over a national election. The typical EC complaint is \"a Wyoming vote is worth 5x a Californian vote\". Without the EC, a full 1/6 of the US electorate lives in the Northeast Megalopolis (Boston-NYC-DC axis) alone, not even considering other cities across the country all leaning Dem. Because \"land doesn't vote, people do\", the populations of these cities will always heavily weight the popular vote. If a red state like Texas adopted popular-vote electors under the EC system, and a Dem won the popular vote nationally, then Texas's electors would go to the Dem. If enough states did this, the results would be the same as a popular vote election. No interstate compact needed unless you want to spring this on an unsuspecting population that doesn't want it.",

Any of the states' that are in the compact legislatures, if controlled by the opposite party than the popular vote getter, will have every incentive to pull out after the election but before the Electoral College meets. And if the other states in the Compact go to federal court to try to enforce the agreement -- it will be ruled unenforceable due to the clause in the Constitution that says state legislatures have the right to structure their own elections.",

                    "comment": "it will be ruled ENFORCEABLE precisely due to the clause in the Constitution that says state legislatures have the right to structure their own elections.\n\nStates with 270+ electoral votes combined are agreeing to award them to the winner of the most popular votes of all 50 states and DC, by simply again changing their state\u2019s law.\n\nThe 2020 Supreme Court unanimously reaffirmed the power of states over their electoral votes, using laws in effect on Election Day.\r  \n\r  \nThe decision held that the power of the legislature before Election Day under Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution is \u201cfar reaching\u201d and it conveys \u201cthe broadest power of determination over who becomes an elector.\u201d This is consistent with 130 years of Supreme Court jurisprudence.\r  \n\r\n\nThe National Popular Vote bill mandates: \"Any member state may withdraw from this agreement, except that a withdrawal occurring six months or less before the end of a President\u2019s term shall not become effective until a President or Vice President shall have been qualified to serve the next term.\"\r  \n\t\r  \nThis six-month \u201cblackout\u201d period includes six important events relating to presidential elections, namely the \r  \n\u25cf national nominating conventions, \r  \n\u25cf fall general election campaign period, \r  \n\u25cf Election Day on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, \r  \n\u25cf meeting of the Electoral College on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, \r  \n\u25cf counting of the electoral votes by Congress on January 6, and \r  \n\u25cf scheduled inauguration of the President and Vice President for the new term on January 20. \r  \n\r  \nAny attempt by a state to pull out of the compact in violation of its terms would violate the Impairments Clause of the U.S. Constitution and would be void.  Such an attempt would also violate existing federal law.  Compliance would be enforced by Federal court action \r  \n\r  \nThe National Popular Vote compact is, first of all, a state law. It is a state law that would govern the manner of choosing presidential electors. A Secretary of State may not ignore or override the National Popular Vote law any more than he or she may ignore or override the winner-take-all method that is currently the law in 48 states. \r  \n\r  \nThere has never been a court decision allowing a state to withdraw from an interstate compact without following the procedure for withdrawal specified by the compact. Indeed, courts have consistently rebuffed the occasional (sometimes creative) attempts by states to evade their obligations under interstate compacts.\r  \n\r  \nIn 1976, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland stated in Hellmuth and Associates v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority:\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhen enacted, a compact constitutes not only law, but a contract which may not be amended, modified, or otherwise altered without the consent of all parties.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nIn 1999, the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania stated in Aveline v. Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole:\r  \n\u201cA compact takes precedence over the subsequent statutes of signatory states and, as such, a state may not unilaterally nullify, revoke, or amend one of its compacts if the compact does not so provide.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nIn 1952, the U.S. Supreme Court very succinctly addressed the issue in Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Commission:\r  \n\u201cA compact is, after all, a contract.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nAn interstate compact is not a mere \u201chandshake\u201d agreement. If a state wants to rely on the goodwill and graciousness of other states to follow certain policies, it can simply enact its own state law and hope that other states decide to act in an identical manner. If a state wants a legally binding and enforceable mechanism by which it agrees to undertake certain specified actions only if other states agree to take other specified actions, it enters into an interstate compact.\r  \n\r  \nInterstate compacts are supported by over two centuries of settled law guaranteeing enforceability. Interstate compacts exist because the states are sovereign. If there were no Compacts Clause in the U.S. Constitution, a state would have no way to enter into a legally binding contract with another state. The Compacts Clause, supported by the Impairments Clause, provides a way for a state to enter into a contract with other states and be assured of the enforceability of the obligations undertaken by its sister states. The enforceability of interstate compacts under the Impairments Clause is precisely the reason why sovereign states enter into interstate compacts. Without the Compacts Clause and the Impairments Clause, any contractual agreement among the states would be, in fact, no more than a handshake.",

How long would that case take? How likely is it that would just go past the December Electoral College meeting date?",

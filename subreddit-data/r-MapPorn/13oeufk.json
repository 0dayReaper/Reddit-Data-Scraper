Imagine the meridians being fixed at the poles and slowly rotating east to west.   The amount of landmass in each hemisphere A and B are two continuous functions. If you can find a point where hemisphere A has more habitable land than hemisphere B, and then a different orientation where hemisphere B has more habitable land than hemispheres A, then the two function must cross at some point (because they are continuous).  But you definitely can find two such orientations, because if you rotate the meridians 180 degrees then A is now where B was before.  QED. Not sure I explained that very clearly.",

Let's do it like you propose, you have a meridian that splits the globe in half, with both halves A and B that have the landmass right? Now let's find the parallel that splits landmass equally in hemisphere A. Will it also split population equally in hemisphere B? Probably not.\n\nI'm not really sure what you're proposing with the different orientations, I feel like you're saying it would work if the two lines that split the globe are not perpendicular, and/or one of them is not parallel to the equator. Maybe, but that was not what was proposed IMO.",

So in the first half we found some meridians that divide the globe in half perfectly.  Now take the two points 90 degrees from these medians.  They are your new \u201cpoles\u201d. An infinite number of great circles run through these two points, all of which will be perpendicular to your meridians, in the same way that all meridians are perpendicular to the equator. So we can repeat the proof with this set of great circles.",

You split your circle in half with a meridian. You try to find a perpendicular great circle that gives you four parts with equal landmass. You rotate said great circle. You can plot, in each hemisphere, how much more landmass one quarter of the globe has vs. the other. The two plots you get are continuous, and they cross, but for this to work you need them to cross at 0. Which might not happen?",

I thought this would work if you did this to split the earth into two hemispheres with equal population and then again cutting it in half with a great circle perpendicular to your first one. But then you get 4 populations A, B, C, D. where A+B=C+D and A+D=B+C. This only means that diagonal quadrants are equal. \n\nI think it is true though and a proof would probably use some generalisation of Borsuk-Ulam but we would end up with (probably) only one unique solution if at all.\nI think we can always pick a point where every great circle passing through it cuts the population in half. A sort of centre of mass. I don't know is this is definitely the intersection of the two cuts but I suspect it is necessary.\n\nIt may also be similar to the ham sandwich problem although with the resrictions of cuts being in perpendicular planes.",

Due to there being infinite, one is guaranteed to work\n\nHere is the reason one is guaranteed to work.\n\nImagine you chose a random one. Let\u2019s say it divides the world 70% 30%. Now as you slowly rotate that around, they will swap so that it is 30% to 70%. Since it is a continuous motion, there has to be a point in which it is 50% to 50%.\n\nAnd if two lines that divide the world 50/50 are perpendicular, then it ALMOST works.\n\nExcept the 4 quadrants could have different landmasses.\n\nLuckily since there are ignite circles to start off with, in a similar fashion to the other method, you can do the same thing, and find the 25%-25%-25%-25% point.\n\nGenerally there will only be one, but there can be multiple.",

If you're going to have a zero it makes sense to do it from where you're making accurate observations of the night sky.\n\nThere were a bunch of meridians and in 1884 there was a conference in Washington to pick just one. London was used by two thirds of all shipping at the time, so was picked. France abstained and continued to use the Paris meridian for a few more decades.\n\n(For various reasons it's actually 102m out from current GPS based 0\u00baE)",

By that point everyone was already using maps made for John Harrison's chronometer and set by the Greenwich Observatory (hence Greenwich Mean Time).\n\nIt just makes more sense practically than any other option at the time, Britain had the largest navy, the most accurate clocks and the Thames River is tidal, so all ships leaving London do so at the same time twice a day. The Greenwich Observatory is on a hill next to a bend in the river so all ships leaving would be given the correct time as measured by the sun and stars at the observatory. The Seine does not have these natural qualities, nor anywhere else. Conveniently it does a good job of dividing the continents along the Bearing Straight, which probably helped it's international adoption.",

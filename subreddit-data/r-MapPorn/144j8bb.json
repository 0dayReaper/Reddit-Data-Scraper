You\u2019ll see that the dark red area is a densely packed residential (and presumably poor) area right next to an airport. \n\nI\u2019m willing to bet that the airport (and lifestyles) caused more cancer than a spec of radiation 44 years ago.",

            "comment": "There was only a very tiny amount of radioactive gas released outside the containment building... less than a x-ray's worth. There was certainly a good amount of contamination within the containment building - which was cleaned up. While this industrial accident was an important learning experience, there was no danger to the public. The entire incident, in terms of risk to public safety, was dramatically inflated by the anti-nuclear political lobby who had no understanding of the technology or the accident. Unfortunately, this hysteria did great harm to our country's nuclear energy program, and only hurt our environment worse by reducing nuclear as a clean energy source. Our world needs clean nuclear energy to replace fossil fuel energy production.\n\nHow do I know what I am talking about? My father was a technical adviser and subject matter expert on Nixon's Presidential Task Force At Three Mile Island, the official investigation. He was a world recognized expert in radiological waste, and was the first chairman of the seven state Southeast Low Level Radiological Waste Compact Commission (https://secompact.org/). After WW2, as part of the Manhattan Project at Oak Ridge National Lab, he was responsible for measuring and studying the radiological fallout of our nuclear weapons testing in Nevada and elsewhere to understand the environmental and public health impacts of nuclear weapons. I do have direct knowledge of the working environment as I myself worked for Florida Power &amp; Light at Turkey Point Nuclear units 1&amp;2 during a steam generator overhaul in the 80's. There I worked inside the containment buildings doing data analysis of the 6000 horsepower reactor coolant pumps.",

The actual amount of radiation released from Three Mile Island was tiny\u2026. it moved the background radiation up by an amount equal to a whopping 1/6th of a chest X-ray",

Also makes a case for nuclear, or at least against coal and natural gas, whose particulate emissions are a huge cancer risk, especially for lung cancer.",

The engineering problems are solved such they newer designs can't melt down, and can be fueled on the waste of older designs. Any beating the table about green environmentalism that does not offer full-throated endorsement of nuclear as part of the green energy solution is fraudulent and charlatan. Its been heartening to see politics fall to the wayside as politicians on both left and right in the US get up to speed on the state of research in this area and start endorsing it.",

Then construct non-profits dedicated to solving social issues, with the solution reliant on your portfolio of patents. If adopted you magnify your wealth dramatically while collecting pats on the back.\n\nYou see the daggers come out when a kid in their college dorm creates a better solution to the problem their non-profits were supposed to guide. When that happens it becomes a very expensive snake oil venture.\n\nAs discerning readers of news and information we are not great at spotting these frauds.

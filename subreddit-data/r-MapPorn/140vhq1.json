Irish is taught in schools in Ireland, and it is common for people to have to learn it there, but rarely if ever use it outside of school.

He had a fairly heavy accent so it wasn't always 100% clear to me what he was saying but at one point I just totally lost the plot of his story, turns out he'd switched to Irish mid-sentence at some point as a joke.  What really struck me about that conversation was just how well the Irish language and the Irish English accent blend together.  It's like the rhythm of the ancient language survives even in areas where no one actually knows how to speak it.  \n\nThen he shared a joint with me at the gas station when the bus stopped for a bathroom break and invited me to go to the Hill of Tara for a Neo-Pagan celebration of Imbolc.  It was definitely the highlight of my visit to Ireland.",

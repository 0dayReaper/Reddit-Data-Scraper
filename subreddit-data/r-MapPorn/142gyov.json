So the pension age needs to increase to at least 73.",

Most of the mature European schemes have had to introduce something like that.  And many are trying to adjust minimum age pension ages, like France \ud83d\ude02\n\nYou could say that pensioners of the 1950s era never lived long enough to get the full benefit of their contributions.  It wasn't that uncommon for men, especially to retire and die not long after.  If there were survivors, they got something of course, although often at a reduced rate.  \n\nI still revolt against articles seeming to cast a picture of the poor young workers struggling to support a horde of non-contributing elders.  In my country \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa, with another hybrid system, little is said of the billions being paid for childcare support, so that both parents can work and acquire their own home.  Not saying I don't support that, more that I'd like to hear less complaining about the aged from that cohort.  The total picture of government transfers is extremely complicated with vested interests everywhere.",

First is what you mentioned: people are living much longer after retirement, so they are withdrawing more years of pensions/benefits. Second is collapsing birthrates so much fewer young people to support them. Worse still, elder care is much more expensive, time-consuming, and long-term than it used to be. 50+ years ago you would get a heart attack or cancer or something and be dead quick. Now you can linger for years or even decades with chronic problems that need constant care.\n\nIt's going to be a giant clusterfuck unless we come up with healthcare robots.",

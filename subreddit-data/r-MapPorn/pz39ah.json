However we don't need a supermaterial for this, we actually have stuff for that. The curvature looks pretty big, but you have to remember that the earth itself is really big, so the asphalt you use for bridges would probably suffice with a couple of tweaks\n* Have you seen the mountainrange at the Argentian-Chile Border? It's one of the highest in the world! The Aconcagua is almost 7 km tall, and while it's not exactly at the border, there are plenty of peaks that are at around 6000 meters tall. I could not find the highest point at the bordery but one I passed by 2 years ago was 5838 m tall (San Lorenzo, south of Paso Agua Negra) if it was a clean cut, the jump into the sea from there would be the highest in the world by far.\n* Depending on how the coiling works, there would be new ocean floor of various depth where chile used to be, so any marine life that settles in the sea would be kinda destroyed if they aren't careful\n\n\nHowever, you could actually practicall use this for multiple reasons:\n\n* The coil would reduce the earthquakes, because to break up a continent you would need several break points and stop the waves\n* In summer it could coil up in the south to decrease heat, and in winter it could do the opposite. Now, Chile isn't a country where the cold is a huge problem, but just sayin\n\nFuck it, Imma write a fanfiction about this silly idea",

Bolivia might have deserved it but it seems like everyone back then was kinda just backstabbing each other constantly. Jumping to conclusions like I did here is exactly what leads to the sort of misunderstanding that leads to decades of fighting!",

Now, Chile was more than happy to use that excuse because we had expansive intentions and the territory was (and is) very rich, but Bolivia fucked up because otherwise we wouldn't have had a justification. They thought that their secret alliance with Peru was going to be enough to deter Chile from attacking but in the end Chile defeated them both and took a lot of land. \n\nThen they signed the treaty of 1904 giving up their coast on a permanent basis. But obviously such a treaty is very hard and they have been pushing to negotiate some kind of arrangement to recover their access to the sea. The closest they were was in 1978 when Pinochet had reached an agreement with Banzer, but Peru (who has to be consulted in any negotiation on the matter) refused and in the end everything just stayed the same. \n\nNow by the same 1904 treaty Chile has the obligation of letting Bolivian trade through our ports, maintaining a railroad from La Paz to Arica (the main Chilean port of the region) and not put tariffs on Bolivian products, that has been for the most part respected (although there's always some frictions here and there, for example when workers from the ports are on strike and the Bolivian products cannot be shipped). Still I think that in the end Bolivia will recover some kind of sovereignty over the sea, probably through a exclave.",

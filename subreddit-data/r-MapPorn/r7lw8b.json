In network terminology, the subreddits are nodes, and their links are edges.\n\nThe edges are where most of the work is. This graph is based on which subreddits are in each subreddit's \"Related Subreddits\" sidebar, so it reflects moderators' choices rather than community activity. This may not be the best method!\n\nAnother potential metric is subreddits sharing links with each other: list how many times two subreddits featured a post with the same URL. This is a content-based approach which tries to reveal which subreddits have the most similar material. Or you can do the same thing but with *users* who post in multiple subreddits, creating a map of which subreddits have the most similar *audiences*.\n\nYou also need to do some edge pruning: there will be an impractical number of subreddit connections, so you have to remove the unimportant or insignificant ones. One approach is to limit yourself to the top number or percent of edges, but this has issues because huge subreddits will have a lot more shared links than you expect, and thus strong but spurious edges. \n\nThe alternative is to extract the 'network backbone', which is a subset of the set of *statistically significant* edges (i.e. an edge of weight X is more likely to be significant between two tiny subreddits than two massive subreddits). /u/rhiever has [a really good Python script](https://github.com/rhiever/network-analysis-scripts/blob/master/subset_backbone_network.py) for performing this analysis. I also know /u/minimaxir has previously done some work on which subreddits share links, it's not something I've looked at in probably 4-5 years.\n\nUm, where was I? Oh yeah: basically if you're able to provide me with the required material to update this chart, you're probably capable of creating it yourself! It *could* utilise praw but in the past I've used BigQuery dumps that I'm not sure are still updated.",

However, he is also claiming that he credited the author before pasting the explanation, which is not true (I checked his comment history before I commented).  It _is_ true that OP never explicitly took credit for the map as far as I know.  \nIn any event, I suggest we reserve our pitchforks for a bigger fish.",

Interestingly enough, statistically the vast majority of Chinese Thai are native speakers of Teochew also.\n\nI remember one time we were in Chatuchak maybe it was 2010? And he overheard a shopkeeper of a noodle shop speaking his dialect just barely in earshot. He dropped what he was shopping for, jogged over there (he was about 62ish at the time?) And started chatting away. My MIL was from the Philippines though and their kids and obviously myself had no idea what he was saying but he eventually shooed us off to go shop while he made a new buddy lol.

The moment you balkanize China into X different countries, you've now got X different Chinese countries and all that you need to do is wait for one of them to grow stronger than its neighbors (or weaken some of them enough) and then they'll get unified again.\n\nIt makes me laugh when you see those Balkanized China maps where each province is a separate country. People have no idea all of those will be Han ethnostates who will probably either just vote to reunify immediately or form something like the Chinese Union.",

People there would willingly consume a lot of Russian culture and media, with the disdain for Russia and everything it does being a refugee of marginalized nationalists.

No one did more to stoke the fires of Ukrainian nationalism, no one made Ukrainians desperately cling to their own culture and language more than Putin and his cronies did.",

And they were hoping that others such as those who considered themselves han/hua would want to become Manchurian.\n\nThat was wishful thinking and this identity politics backfired, and they ended up isolating themselves as Manchurian, instead of creating \"the new han/hua\".\n\nThe identity politics of previous Chinese histories have always played a big role in shaping social discourse and frictions.  Actually imo, today's China is relatively very inclusive when compared to previous dynasties, and funnily the most exclusive ones are those influenced by the West such as in HK and TW.\n\nThe previous and major Jurchen established dynasty as you might know, was the Jin dynasty.",

This is partially because the Chinese imperial infrastructure was so good, and Manchurian didn't have an alternate structure to replace all that. \n\nThis is in juxtaposition with European style warfare, which was more oriented on expanding into and conquering opposing power structures.",

                            "comment": "Technically, yes. It depends on which pocket you're talking about tho.\n\nThe pocket of \"Kalmyk\" (The correct term for the ethnic group is actually Oirat. \"Kalmyk\" refers specifically to the Oirats of Kalmykia in Russia.) closest to the center of China are descendants of the Khoshut (eastern) tribe. They are not the ancestors of the Kalmyks in Russia today.\n\nThe eastern tribe broke off from the Oirat heartland in Xinjiang around the same time as the Torghut (western) tribe. This western tribe is the real ancestor of the Kalmyks. **So, the most accurate statement would be to say that both the Kalmyks and the Khoshut originate from Xinjiang.**\n\nIf you're curious:\n\n[The reason that these 2 tribes migrated away was because they were unhappy with the settlement efforts of the Choros (central) tribe. The central tribe was the largest tribe at the time and their Khan was trying his best to regroup all the Oirat tribes and get them to try farming and using bureaucracy, with the end goal of forming a kingdom to rival the Mongols and Chinese. These were very new ideas at the time for the almost entirely nomadic Oirat, so many said \"this guy sucks\" and just straight up galloped away.\n\nThe eastern tribe left for Tibet, as they were very religious Buddhists, and figured they would be welcomed by the Dalai Lama. They were, and they went on to found the Khoshut Khanate in Tibet, protecting it from Qing rule for several decades.\n\nThe central tribe did eventually found their kingdom: the Dzungar Khanate. They managed to implement their new modern policies, they conquered the whole of the Xinjiang region, and they eventually did kick both the Mongol's and China's asses, and they even conquered the Khoshut Khanate for abandoning them earlier. Soon after though, the Chinese kicked the Dzungars' asses even harder and they died.\n\nThe western tribe left for the Volga Steppes of Russia, a place they figured they could raid for good plunder, as they knew the Russians had money after trading with them for decades. They adopted the new name of Kalmyk (originally it was Torghut), and they founded the Kalmyk Khanate. They successfully raided the Russians, kicked out the native Turks, warred against the neighboring muslim Khanates, and generally had a great time pillaging the whole region. Eventually though, they allied themselves to the Russians, and this unfortunately led to their downfall, as the Tsars slowly but surely tightened their grip over the next century, reducing Kalmyk autonomy and eventually genociding them.]",

So from 1965 until Deng Xiaoping's reforms in the 80s, a large portion of the chinese people who emigrated to the US were from Hong Kong and spoke cantonese simply because it was very difficult for the majority of people who spoke other dialects to even get the opportunity to leave.",

Chinatowns are commonly still Cantonese, but more recent economic immigrants are even spread across the country and thus are much more likely to speak a Mandarin dialect.",

                    "comment": "I speak both Cantonese and Mandarin. While most Cantonese and Mandarin words share roots with each other, pronunciation sounds different enough to each other that they\u2019re not understandable.\n\nA handle of words sound almost identical between the two: \u5e36\u5b50 (scallop) is pronounced daizi in both, \u6771 (East) is pronounced \u201cdong\u201d; \u8cb7(buy), and so on.\n\nSome roots are very similar in a predictable way, and this is roughly 25%:\n- Cantonese \u201c-oi\u201d is almost always Mandarin \u201c-ai\u201d, e.g. \u6d77 hoi/hai, \u4ee3 doi/dai, \u4f86 loi/lai, \u84cb goi/gai, \u83dc coi/cai, but there are exceptions and it doesn\u2019t always work in reverse (see \u201cscallop\u201d and \u201cbuy\u201d examples above).\n\nSome roots are similar, but the unpredictable enough that converting back and forth can be unpredictable, these are probably another 25%:\n- \u96e3(difficult) is nan/nan, but \u5357 (south) is nam/nan and \u7537 (male) is nam/nan, so sound conversion from M-&gt;C is unpredictable.\n- \u96de (chicken) is gai/ji, which seems very different, until one realizes that many g/k sounds become j/q in Mandarin: \u4eac (capital) ging/jing, \u89e3 gai/jie, \u6c5f gong/jiang\n- Mandarin has only -n and -ng ending sounds, so Cantonese roots that end in -p, -t, -k tend to end in diphthongs or falling tones in Mandarin: \u767d (white) bak/bai, \u767e (hundred) bak/bai, \u4f2f (uncle) bak/bo, \u9ed1 (black) hak/hei \n\nWhen several of the above rules are combined, even words that share the same roots can sound completely different, and this is probably another 25% of words:\n- \u5b78 (learn) hok/xue, \u96ea (snow) syuet/xue, \u8840 (blood) hyuet/xue. Notice the same sound in Mandarin but 3 different pronunciations in Cantonese.\n- \u9db4 (crane) hok/he, \u5b78(learn) hok/xue, \u4fe0 (hero) hap/xia, \u76d2 (box) hap/he. Opposite example with roots that sound same in Cantonese but different in Mandarin.\n\nFinally, the remaining words might have different roots or diverged meanings between Cantonese and Mandarin.\n- diverged meanings: \u96c0 zuek/que is a generic word for \u201cbird\u201d in Cantonese, but means \u201csparrow\u201d specifically in Mandarin. \u98df sik/shi means \u201ceat\u201d in Cantonese and ancient Chinese, but in Mandarin is used in compound words to mean \u201cfood\u201d. \u767d\u83dc bokcoi/baicai means \u201cbok choy\u201d in Cantonese but \u201cnapa cabbage\u201d in Mandarin. Words with same roots but slightly diverged meanings tend to be in greater frequency for domestic, everyday vocabulary rather than educated vocabulary, meaning low in number but high in usage frequency\n- Non-Chinese roots: Cantonese has a handful of words that make up a small part of the vocabulary, but are very common in everyday, domestic vocabulary: words for \u201ccorrect\u201d, \u201ccover\u201d, \u201cscalding hot\u201d, \u201csquat\u201d, \u201ctake\u201d, \u201ccry\u201d, and a few others that might have been borrowed from some non-Chinese language (probably some form of proto-Tai or proto-Zhuang) some thousand+ years ago. There\u2019s only a handful of such words, but since they\u2019re part of everyday life they\u2019re used with high frequency.\n\nThis is just different in pronunciations of the same roots, I haven\u2019t touched yet on how the two can have different vocabulary preferences, or the differences in grammar.",

A lot of ethnic Koreans from Yanbian are reportedly moving to South Korea, Japan, the US, or to places further into China's interior. \n\n[Here's a recent Yonhap News Agency article](https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20220829130300371#:~:text=2020%EB%85%84%20%EA%B8%B0%EC%A4%80%EC%9C%BC%EB%A1%9C%20%EC%98%8C%EB%B3%9C,%EC%A0%88%EB%B0%98%20%EC%9D%B4%ED%95%98%EB%A1%9C%20%EC%A4%84%EC%96%B4%EB%93%A0%20%EA%B2%83%EC%9D%B4%EB%8B%A4.) on the topic, although it is written in Korean. \n\nI first learned about Yanbian from a friend whom I met while attending a university in South Korea between 2016 and 2020, who is originally from Yanbian, and whose mother and older brother moved to Jiangsu province -- which is near Shanghai -- sometime after her father died. \n\nShe used to give me revision tips for essays that I wrote in Korean, and revised my entire senior thesis in Korean language and literature for me, while I translated the abstracts for several academic papers that she wrote -- as well as for her PhD dissertation -- into English for her.\n\nFrom what she has told me, the economy around Yanbian is not that great, and lots of people, especially younger people, tend to leave for greener pastures. She grew up on a farm near there, but it seems that she knew that she had to leave.\n\nShe actually just completed her PhD in Korean language and literature, and is now trying to become a university instructor or something back in China, maybe in Shanghai.",

If you wander around in Guangzhou, Dongguan and the countryside, you will definitely hear Cantonese, even spoken by kids. It's not like in e.g. Toulouse where only the subway speaks Occitan.\n\nI also noticed from personal experience that my fellow colleagues from Mandarin area tend to say what you said, while my friends from other places don't.",

His grandson Kublai would complete the conquest of Southern China, but also lost control of the western mongol khanates. To solidify his rule over China he would proclaim the Yuan Dynasty, in line with Chinese imperial tradition, which would rule over both Mongolia and China for most of the next century. In the mid-14th century, a bunch of Han Chinese rebellions broke out eventually culminating in the Ming dynasty overthrowing the Yuan and pushing them out of China back to Mongolia. Ming would be able to exert influence over what is now Inner Mongolia, but not Outer Mongolia, separated by the Gobi desert. Finally, in the early 17th century, the Manchus would form the Qing Dynasty, and along with conquering Ming China, would conquer  Mongolia, ruling it until they were overthrown in 1911.\n\nThe new Republic of China would claim all Qing lands, including all of Mongolia. It was only with the People\u2019s Republic of China, being initially dependent on the Soviet Union, that Outer Mongolia was released as a independent state (but really a Soviet satellite). Inner Mongolia continues to be part of China today, and there are in fact more Mongolians living in China than there are in the state of Mongolia today.",

Ppl from Yunnan wanting to communicate with someone from Manchuria would find it extremely difficult to constantly translate the two languages, so ppl have accepted the need for a national language to simplify things \n\nSimilar to the French Canadian model, french is emphasized in areas that utilize it, like Quebec and eastern Atlantic islands, but it's just become the norm that English replaces french and indigenous languages in all other territories.",

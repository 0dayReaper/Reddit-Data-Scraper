For the last two years there has been mostly a cycle of elections with similar divided vote, failure to form a government, new elections. \n\nWe had a government that lasted six months, but it seems the coalition agreement was not respected and one of the governing parties (populist-reformist) called a vote of no confidence. \n\nWe are now again in a stage where a government is being discussed, and the old corrupt populists and the reformist oppositions had an agreement for a coalition (though they specifically avoided calling it so), but it seems it may be tanked by some internal recordings leak that puts an edge in the already fragile partnership (the reformist parties have sworn to put the old government leadership in jail, even arrested the leader when they had their six months, but had not.prepared a case). Also, the recording can be interpreted as leaders of the coalition expressing intent to allow chiefs of state security services to be appointed by foreign governments, which is a treason. Or not really, but the optics are terrible in any case.\n\nMy feeling is that if there is a government at all, it won't last long. I also don't see anything much different happening on the next few months down the road - maybe the parties on the recordings tank and different reformists take their share, but nothing major. It's a genuine deadlock.",

It has no declared political position and no major actions that would qualify it in practice. Maybe if you review the political positions of the ministers you can come up with some kind of aggregate qualification. But without a parliament that passes laws, I don't think I can say that a government is left or light. This division is usually mostly a parliamentary one.",

And tbh they don't really exist anymore with only 4 MP's still claim to be in the party.\nInstead you should add the Republican Party which was made by the PiS inspired revolt in Porozumienie. And maybe Kukiz'15 but they are not part of the coalition but are supporting the government. But so is \"Polskie Sprawy\" which are made from former Kukiz'15 and PiS members that have left the PiS but are supporting them again.\nYes it's complicated in details but can be simplified to the actual coalition of PiS and Suwerenna Polska(Solidarna Polska just changed their name to \"Sovereign Poland\"  to be more Anti EU) and rest is just to have the majority and don't exist outside of Sejm(Parliament).",

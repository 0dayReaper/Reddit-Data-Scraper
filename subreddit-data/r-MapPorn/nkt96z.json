Behavioral and economic analysis conducted by authorities and independently shows no change and no duress in the Captains behavior that could\u2019ve caused him to down the plane intentionally (this is noted in the official investigation report and others). I understand why you say most likely but in reality the pilot suicide theory has as much evidence as anything else, which is almost nothing conclusive.\n\nEDIT: With Sources:\n\nPilot behavior analysis: 1.5.11 \nBehavioral Events \n\u201cThere were no behavioral signs of social isolation, change in habits or interest, self-neglect, drug or alcohol abuse of the PIC, FO and the cabin crew. The CCTV recordings at KLIA on 07 March 2014 were evaluated to assess the behavioral pattern of the PIC, and the FO from the time of arrival at KLIA until boarding time. Three previous CCTV recordings of the movements of the PIC in KLIA were also viewed to see the behavioral pattern and were compared with the CCTV recordings on 07 March 2014. The PIC\u2019s movement was captured on CCTV at KLIA on the following days: \u2022 07 March 2014 - To Beijing SAFETY INVESTIGATION REPORT MH370 (9M-MRO) 38 \u2022 03 March 2014 - To Denpasar \u2022 26 February 2014 - To Melbourne \u2022 21 February 2014 - To Beijing On studying the PIC\u2019s behavioral pattern on the CCTV recordings on the day of the flight and prior 3 flights there were no significant behavioral changes observed. On all the CCTV recordings the appearance was similar, i.e. well-groomed and attired. The gait, posture, facial expressions and mannerism were his normal characteristics.\n\nHome Flight sessions: \u00a0\"There were seven 'manually programmed' waypoint coordinates, that when connected together, will create a flight path from KLIA to an area south of the Indian Ocean through the Andaman Sea. But a forensic report concluded there were no unusual activities other than game-related flight simulations\u2026 These coordinates were stored in the Volume Shadow Information (VSI) file dated 03 February 2014. The function of this file was to save information when a computer is left idle for more than 15 minutes. Hence, the RMP Forensic Report could not determine if the waypoints came from one or more files. The RMP Forensic Report on the simulator also did not find any data that showed the aircraft was performing climb, attitude or heading maneuvers, nor did they find any data that showed a similar route flown by MH370.\u201d Page 73 in the final investigation report \n\nLink to final investigation for above two: http://mh370.mot.gov.my/MH370SafetyInvestigationReport.pdf\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, the Team is unable to determine the real cause for the disappearance of MH370.\u201d That is the last words of the investigative section of the full final 495 page report released July 2nd, 2018.",

Yet, *someone* did all those things, and it\u2019s tough to assume those actions were all hypoxia-induced. \n\nFurthermore, the first sharp nearly 180 degree turn occurred right after the plane vacated Malaysian ATC, and just before it was due to enter Vietnam ATC. In other words, the perfect time to turn off the transponder and disappear with little fuss. \n\nDid the captain act with nefarious intent? I don\u2019t know.

Although I think that as a general rule, most (long-haul) planes in active service today have longer range than your typical plane during the cold war. So these days, you'd probably skip the Anchorage stop, and go more like: directly over the pole - just skirting around the edge of Russian airpsace.\n\nAt least that would be the case for northern Asian destinations (Japan, etc.).\n\nSouthern destinations would probably take you south, over the Middle East. Some contentions airspace regions there too (thinking Syria), but still generally doable.",

Are they that much fragile and inept to accept some basic criticism? Yeah, we're worse off in 99% of the metrics, but one of the few odd things communism has done better was the inclusion of women in the workforce and promoting gender equality, is it that hard to accept that fact?\n\nI'm currently in Germany in my masters in a STEM area, applied physics. Back home we would have around 50-50 the number of women and men in my physics program, even a bit more women I would say. Here you have literally only 1 girl from western Europe and 15 guys. A similar thing in other \"neighboring\" STEM programs. Whereas the ratio of males and females from eastern Europe, India, Iran and the rest of Asia is around 50-50",

This has been especially noticeable since the 1940s, when the male population declined sharply due to the war and women began to be attracted to work even more often. Therefore, even now you can very often meet a lot of women in \"male\" specialties. Now it has nothing to do with feminism and wages. It just happened that way historically. But it is more difficult for a woman to get a leadership position. In this regard, little has changed. There are female managers, but there are fewer of them as a percentage than male managers. This can be explained both by gender inequality and simply by ordinary everyday or physiological reasons. For example, it is difficult for a woman to become a high-ranking military officer, simply because there are very few women in the army. But in some areas, on the contrary, it is more difficult to meet male bosses (education, medicine, economic departments of enterprises).\n\nThere are also many women scientists in Russia and the countries of the former USSR. But they write fewer scientific papers. Why there is such a situation I cannot answer, I am not a scientist.",

In countries like Iran &amp; India, women often choose STEM because it allows economic/financial independence\u2026while in more developed nations, women often choose subjects like psychology or English.\n\nBut it goes beyond just STEM: the more developed a country is, the more likely it is that a woman will work part-time and instead will revert to traditional gender roles!\n\nMore generally, there are 3 phases:\n\nPhase 1 (not developed): This is an agrarian society where education is not the norm. Women only have a rudimentary education level (reading/writing/math) and many end up as housewives.\n\nPhase 2 (developing): This is a rapidly industrializing society\u2026women now have access to higher education and pursue subjects which can improve their financial status (ie STEM).\n\nPhase 3 (developed): this is the industrialized society. Women have rights/basic needs met, so they have no need to pursue highly demanding careers. So they often revert to traditional roles.\n\nI\u2019ve seen all three phases in my own life. My grandmothers (housewives who grew up in rural India) only have a basic middle/high school education level. My mother has a masters degree in EE and is a workaholic. Many of my cousins have a bachelors degree and are planning for FIRE (financial independence, retire early).\n\nI hope that in the future, my kids will have the financial freedom to pursue music or art or whatever they want to do.",

I would argue that this kind of phase 3 must be occurring in countries for which phase 2 did not last long enough or for which financial development was not enough to kill stereotypes and social pressure for filling in the traditional roles. For example some post-communist countries, e.g. Poland, I would definitely classify as developed (maybe fresh according to some standards but if you want to prove me wrong point to statistics that show an increase in number of women realising the traditional gender roles there that is not correlated with financial downturn in the country) and they present themselves much better on the map.",

So when the comparison is so close, it's entirely possible that the trend doesn't appear due to simple statistical aberration. When the difference is actually significant you see the paradoxical trend.\n\n&gt;can it be in one hand that no matter how much a person love for high energy physics if faced with expending their whole day with hostility in the field, little chance to be considered for advance and the possibility of somebody else taking credit for their work that they may want to chose other fields where their chances are better?\n\nWouldn't that be more prevalent in countries like Iran and other Middle Eastern countries where it turns out women are a greater percentage of stem workers compared European countries even? So this point doesn't make sense. You can't honestly say the women face more hostility in Europe as compared to Iran...\n\n&gt;and in the other hand, people (not just women) not wanting to chose stem because the area being undervaluated vs other areas like social sciences and law practice....i.e. more chance of a higher paid position, hence making the issue even more prevalent\n\nWhat? STEM careers are the highest value careers out there... Social sciences and education for example are actually valued even less. So what you are saying is contradictory to reality. And as far as I know, law is not a female dominated profession.\n\n&gt;in any case I don't see it as when \"women\" having the choice deciding to chose the \"easy\" way out, lots of people regardless of gender will do that and if women face even additional obstacles obviously many will want to avoid the missery in favour of let's say law or teaching to make their ends meet where it was decided for them to be a more suitable role\n\nNo one said anything about the easy way out... They could just be choosing the careers they do out of genuine person interest... Besides there is also the monetary value of careers, which is more important to men and hence they are likely to gravitate towards fields that pay more (Like STEM).\n\n&gt;no one is trying to \"force\" women or anyone into stem, what happens is that we acknolege the need for people in the field and to make it more popular and studies trying to explain the reasons why women were under represented in those fields indicate that they face difficulties due to gender bias that needed to be addressed if we want for them to chose such field, nobody like to be treated with contempt or be ignored or see a colleague acnoledged preferibly over oneself because gender bias or any other bias for that matter\n\nI think you have the meaning of 'force' wrong here. No one's forcing individual women into stem. But there is an artificial push to get more women into stem. And that push is a heavily misguided one. Instead of focusing on grassroots problems, they try to make a foolish quick fix that harms other people's opportunities.\n\n&gt;The bias against acknowledging the achievements of female scientists in favour of male colleagues is so common that there is even a word for it: 'The Matilda Effect,' and its corollary, 'The Matthew Effect.'\"\n\nIs that even a thing? Cuz I don't think there's any case where that happened without confounding factors. The most famous examples are Rosalind Franklin and Lise Meitner and they didn't lose out on the Nobel prize due to being women.",

From what I\u2019ve heard talking to people it very much depends on where you are from. In the US I\u2019ve heard plenty of stories from women physicists about experiencing some degree of discrimination or harassment from both prominent physicists and people I personally know.\n\nThat being said, at one point last year I was talking to two of my classmates, who were women from Germany and Iran (for those who aren\u2019t aware Iran actually has a very highly educated populace, higher than many European countries, including among women *even though they very clearly have huge gender discrimination issues outside academia*), and they were arguing that from what they\u2019ve seen if anything men face discrimination when it comes to people being picked for educational programs and jobs. *I* was the one arguing that sexism towards women is still fairly rampant in physics, which was a weird position for me to be in. I don\u2019t know if these two people are a good representation of most people\u2019s experiences in their countries, but it was really interesting to me that they not only seemed to feel like they had not faced (gender) discrimination, but felt that it was in the other direction for the current generation.\n\nAlso the program we are in is about 50/50 gender-wise, might even have more women than men but it\u2019s very close regardless.",

I understand that you never got into causality.  What I was telling you is that your now-repeated claim about the numbers is an interpretation ***not*** shared by all researchers, many of whom dispute its existence.  Of course causality is not widely accepted for something that isn\u2019t even widely accepted to occur.\n\nFor starters, metrics used to support the theory of a paradoxical trend are not very convincing as they don\u2019t control for, or regress out, important relevant variables (to be fair, the most interesting variables have no great metrics eg how does one measure socialization of women I to caretaking roles).\n\nThe most popular study claiming the existence of this paradox (Stoet and Geary) actually got quite a bit of heat, which was well deserved IMO since the authors misstated (and some claim purposefully misrepresented, which is plausible but a bit of a stretch and more importantly undemonstrated) the data for their analysis, which is a fairly large thing to miss (they developed their own index for the gender ratio in STEM occupations but said that they were just analyzing the gender difference, failing to mention their invention and inclusion of this index which was itself a fair attempt to control for gender ratios in tertiary ed but is completely untested as such a metric).  Richardson et al went back-and-forth with Stoet and Geary on this and were ultimately unable to replicate the findings using other metrics of gender inequality.\n\nOn top of those who doubt the existence of the trend, there are others who think that the relationship as demonstrated is specious, and that the real trend is between other (non-paradoxical) variables.  Some possibilities include the privilege of the wealthy to pursue gender stereotypes in ways that may be financially unsound for poorer classes, the role that restricted access to education may have in selecting for only the most motivated STEMers, and the relationship that may exist between societal involvement in STEM education and the prevalence of corresponding gender stereotypes.\n\nAnyway, Stoet and Geary are not the only authors who claim to see the trend and I want to be very clear that I\u2019m not claiming otherwise or coming down hard against it (though obviously I remain skeptical and unconvinced).  All I\u2019ve been saying is that while some do see this \u201cparadox\u201d, other authors do not see it and a third group of authors note that what \u201ctrend\u201d they do see may not be particularly paradoxical at all but rather related to other phenomena (ie not gender equality).  \n\nSo in sum, claiming that the \u201cnumbers themselves\u201d are some foregone \u201cfact\u201d is at absolute best premature.  Thorough demonstration of causality for a phenomenon that isn\u2019t even accepted to exist, to say nothing of a consensus on the topic, is something that *even you*, u/RyukHunter, wouldn\u2019t be expected to find.",

When one has freedom to chose they also need inspiration and role model to promote a choice. And that often lacks for women to chose STEM. I recently wrote a letter about inclusion in space industry and STEM in general. For me personally, inspiration to go into STEM was sci-fi shows and cartoons. And while writing the letter I found out almost none of those shows that made me interested in science had women or girl as lead character except for Powerpuff girls and Kim Possible. Not only that, cartoons like Dexter's Laboratory were kind of sexist and toxic for equality. Another, being media's portrait of being a nerdy girl/woman as something bad and sad pushes young girls and women away from STEM. And for those who do make into STEM, there is harassment and hostile conditions in men dominated workplace discourage them.",

Anecdotally, I have seen an absurd amount of boys whose future plans were influenced by video games and cartoons when I was growing up. 'I'll build an exoskeleton like this!' is just one somewhat impractical dream that my loved one had as a kid, probably with an idea that it would make him indestructible soldier and he would be op like in the games. Video games themselves, especially from a girl's perspective are a big topic that I will skip this time.\n\nOverall, I don't think those fields need to be made more inviting. Primarily because I have not heard of sexual harassment, sexist remarks, employers avoiding hiring because of possiblity of pregnancy (jk), social pressure to change profession, and unfair pays for men in those fields. I might be wrong here. Those kind of things shouldn't be happening no matter which gender is involved. Rather, I think that first the 'invitations' should be given out more broadly, equally. This is something that should happen during childhood. \n\nAlso, given finite amount of men and women with almost equal split if one area has 'too many men' then the other will have to have 'too many women'. Provided that both genders are equally likely to have studious personalities and aim for STEM in general, this is what you end up with.",

I seriously doubt there are any real barriers to women entering STEM in Western Europe any more than in North America. By \"real barriers\" I mean laws or inability to access STEM education.\n\nAlso, considering most of the range here is between 49-58 %, I'm going to call it \"same\". That is a range that suggests equivalent freedom to pursue employments.",

But when one has freedom to chose, they also need inspiration/motivation and role model to promote a choice. And that often lacks for women to chose STEM. I recently wrote a letter about inclusion in space industry and STEM in general. For me personally, inspiration to go into STEM was sci-fi shows and cartoons. And while writing the letter I found out almost none of those shows that made me interested in science had women or girl as lead character except for Powerpuff girls and Kim Possible. Not only that, cartoons like Dexter's Laboratory were kind of sexist and toxic for equality. Another, being media's portrait of being a nerdy girl/woman as something bad and sad pushes young girls and women away from STEM. And for those who do make into STEM, there is harassment and hostile conditions in men dominated workplace discourage them.\n\nSo saying, more freedom means less women in STEM is not correct.",

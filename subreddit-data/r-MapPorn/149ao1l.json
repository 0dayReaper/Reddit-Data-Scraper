    "postText": "I made a map of a hiking trip I did in Ecuador. My goal was to show the information most relevant to hiking: tree cover, elevation, and population density. Feedback on the map would be great. The background is transparent so the labels are hard to see on dark mode. You can read more about the trip in the article \"Freestyle hiking in Ecuador\" on my website.",

The problem is that, if they don't include these territories, it's too obvious that most of the empire was conquered off of people with inferior technology and who got mainly massacred by illnesses they weren't prepared for. Of course, this wouldn't give much room for them to cyclejerk like they do still in modern times.",

The furthest flung territories, for instance, had no Spanish roads, no installations, and no permanent Spanish settlements. Even California, at the peak of Spanish influence, had just the 21 missions along the coast and three Presidios, which were a constant money drain, never becoming a profitable or tax-paying province like the Spanish wanted. Further north includes vast swaths that no Spanish person even set foot on, and local Indians may not have even known the Spanish claimed them.",

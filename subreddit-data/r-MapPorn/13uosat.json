Now most kids are taught, besides Javanese, bahasa Indonesia and write in Latin script. Javanese are actually three languages in one, while Indonesian is easy in it's structure, and very easy to learn. However, I do appreciate it a lot when my step-family seems to talk a familiar gibberish (I speak Indonesian but not Javanese), because I just love that people keep the diverse array of languages alive.",

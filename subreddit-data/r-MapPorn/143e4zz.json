Basically Beeches are destined for functional extinction from eastern North American woodlands. Enjoy them and their many mycorrhizal companions while you can!",

The mass extinction event isn't so abstract and restricted to hard to understand tropical or oceanic species counts when you go for a walk in your local forest and all of the trees are dead.",

In countries like China the government would not allow people to build private museums to begin with and generally do not support preserving local history. They would prefer to push most of their citizens to national museums where it is easier to control the narrative of their own history.\"  \n\n\nThere are 535 private museums in China . Seriously why is there is such a stupid logic like \"It is this so it must be like this \" from reddit experts I don't get. \n\nAlso there are many other types of museums not just history museums.",

Most museums are very small and local, they require a lot of volunteers and local donations to operate and poor people generally don\u2019t have the money or free time to spend supporting them. In countries like China the government would not allow people to build private museums to begin with and generally do not support preserving local history. They would prefer to push most of their citizens to national museums where it is easier to control the narrative of their own history.",

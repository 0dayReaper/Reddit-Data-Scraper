The Shire - Hobbiton specifically - is meant to be on the same latitude as Oxford, while Minas Tirith is meant to be on the same latitude as the Italian city of Ravenna (which was the capital of the late Roman Empire after Rome itself was sacked by the barbarians; this likely served as the inspiration for Minas Tirith and Osgiliath).\n\nSo if Mount Doom is a a little over a hundred miles east and fifty miles north of Minas Tirith, that puts it roughly somewhere in Slovenia. Assuming the longitude also matches (which it look like it does), then from Oxford that's a journey of around 820 miles as the crow flies (although of course Frodo and Sam didn't take a direct route).",

Often it's just one or two actors pretty flatly reading a bad translation of the dialogue with the original audio playing in the background. \n\nBut they are cheap for a reason, and it's usually because they were part of bootleg releases. I'm not sure if that's what might be referenced for Russia with this map, or the \"official\" televised release in the 2010s, which seems to have a normal dub.",

Just maybe 15 to max 20 eggs per year in 6-7 cakes (that I have to make sugar free ie with stevia and such, so I avoid baking them).\n\nBut then it is much more than meat which I do not eat at all. Granted, I eat sea food and fish twice to maximum three times a week. The rest is vegetables, if I cook at all.\n\nDairy (fatty blue, hard and fetta cheeses, creams and such) is my staple food. I eat that twice to three times a day. Not healthy to focus on mostly one type of food, I know, but I have been eating like that for 40 years, since high school. Ah well...",

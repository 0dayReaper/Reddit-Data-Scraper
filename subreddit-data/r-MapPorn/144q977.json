And it's not that small, it's as big as England or South Korea.\n\nIt just looks so small because it's between the 5th and the 8th largest countries in the world",

The more \"recently settled\" countries aren't really recently settled, it's just that they didn't sustain mass population growth before modern technology. There are reasons India and China grew in population for centuries while places like Canada &amp; Uruguay didn't.",

But some of the parts like Uruguay and Canada where the population is concentrated, even though their population was cut down by the colonizers it was never as high or as spread out as in other more fertile parts of the world.",

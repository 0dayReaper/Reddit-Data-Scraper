Contrarily to what we might think, it's not a reference to the time when the Flanders (including Artois) belonged to Spain (and the Habsburg), but to the 9 castles that were said to belong to Blanche de Castile, queen of France for a few years in the first half of the 13rd century. It could also be simply because the first count of Artois was his son.",

Neither Savoie nor Haute-Savoie have an official coat of arms, and de facto use the [Savoy cross](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Blason_duche_fr_Savoie.svg?uselang=fr) as their heraldry. The versions your map shows were proposed by artist Robert Louis (who actually did design the official coats of arms of a lot of the d\u00e9partements).\n\nEdit: I'm seeing more issues (based on [this wikipedia page](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armorial_des_d%C3%A9partements_de_France)):\n\n-the coat of arms of Ain (01) is the unofficial one designed by the departmental archives\n\n-the d\u00e9partements from Corsica have no official coat of arms; the [Moor's Head](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Blason_de_Corse.svg?uselang=fr) is also commonly found.\n\n-The mountains of Alpes-Maritimes (06) should be green, not black\n\n-Drome (26) has an alternative design\n\n-Indre (36) has the wrong coat of arms\n\n-So does Loire-Atlantique (44)\n\n-Yonne (89) is wrong\n\nOverall, this map seems a bit sloppy, imo.",

                    "comment": "In heraldry, the rule of tincture says that \"metal should not be put on metal, nor colour on colour\" during the composition of a coat of arm. \n\nYellow (aka. gold) and silver are the only two metals, so of course they will be featured a lot in comparison of other colours, which are called \"stains\". There were historically only 4 main stains due to the availability of the required materials to produce said tinctures : red, blue, black, and green (with green remaining pretty rare for technical reasons). I guess that's how you end up with so little colour variations !\n\nAlso for political and historical reasons that led to those designs, the blue and gold fleur-de-lys\u00e9 was the cost of arm of France (and this pattern is now even called France), so of course it gets used in A LOT of those designs.\n\nOn the other hand, the golden cross on red field was the coat of arm of the county of Toulouse, and the red stripes on gold field was the coat of arm of the county of Provence (and of the old kingdom of Aragon in Spain too). Those two counties together covered almost the whole southern half of France before the Revolution, so numerous Southern d\u00e9partements have yellow and red on their coat of arms.\n\nBetween the scarcity of available colours, the rule of tincture, and the historical affiliations of the d\u00e9partements, you end up with so many blue/red/yellow colours !",

Despite the revolution in 1789 and centralisation efforts that go back to the 16th century and continued well into the 20th century, the French regions are still culturaly different. Especially the north-south difference is big and it's logical that local regions kept their local identity close to them and the coats of arms is part of that. The French Revolution focussed on getting rid of the clergy and nobility but did not try to destroy the cultural history of France (eg. Buildings, paintings, coats of arms,...)",

Country boundaries and dots on a flat map don't really tell you much.\n\nSo, I made a 3D interactive visualization of the most populated world cities: https://popumap.vercel.app/\n\nYou can mouse over the 3D columns for city name and population. Enjoy exploring :)\n\nThe data is taken from [this cool Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_and_cities_with_100,000_or_more_inhabitants).",

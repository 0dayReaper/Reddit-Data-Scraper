There weren\u2019t really many other places that they could hang out even if they wanted to and a lot of times those taverns/bars and other establishments were managed or even owned by women. Some states in the west were extremely progressive. Imagine that first state to give woman right to vote was Wyoming in 1869 and a bunch of western states followed suite with California finally in 1911. Compare that to the national right to vote, first time a woman voted in a presidential election was 1920.",

If you went to a saloon at that time, if it was a Chinese saloon, it had only Chinese. The Irish often had their own . In Nebraska, the Greeks had their own and second generation White Americans had their own. They rarely mixed. Arizona was the sole exception where Mexicans did go to white dominated saloons(but then again, back then most Mexicans were basically White Spaniards).  \nSexism was less of an issue out West because women were able to occupy niches that men did not want to occupy, but people often forget that there was much much much more hostility towards the Chinese than there even was towards African Americans based on the literature of the time in the West and this was at a time when sunset towns against African Americans existed already in California.   \nAlso people tend to forget that until the mass white flight of the 1950s, White Americans still often identified themselves based on their ethnic groups with the exception of those whose ancestors had gone to the US extremely early and these groups were used as a foundation for xenophobia. And it was not just against the Irish.  he biggest lynching in America was not surprisingly a racist incident, but a xenophobic one. They mass lynched Italians in New Orleans. And that automatically ended any appeal that the South had for Italian migrants, similar climate to Northern Italy aside. it is why the Midwest was so hostile to Greeks in Nebraska, Poles in places like Michigan and the Irish almost everywhere.  \nBack to the Chinese.  \nThe concept of the \"Yellow Peril\" existed in the US, Canada and Australia where the fear was that the Chinese were so many that they would overwhelm the three nations if allowed to come in large numbers which is why those saloons would have had almost no Chinese women as well.",

How could you levy an official legal case without data to show that discrimination is indeed occurring? The datasets are also used by researchers to identify disparate societal outcomes that seem to follow racial/ethnic lines.\n\nI can't think of many countries that don't struggle with alienation of or discrimination against some sort of minority group within their borders. Is it so wrong to create a system that monitors this fact and creates a legal precedent to ameliorate it? I will not go into this further, this has been explained plenty of times. Stop parroting idiotic shit.\n\nThe real problem with the melting pot language is that it has really only ever applied to people of European descent. Everyone else gets thrown into the mix peripherally but relationships between people of different races aren't common enough to call anything a melting pot. Add in the fact that the US still suffers long term effects from discriminatory policies and mentalities in the past and the US is more like a mosaic than a melting pot.",

Many white Americans especially in conservative areas like the South and rural areas in the Midwest already self identify ethnically as American. Many white Americans in other areas self identify as part German, part Irish, (interestingly enough I would say I am part English and part Welsh but wouldn't say I'm part British), etc., in terms of ethnicity but consider themselves American in terms of nationality and culture. If you are asking if white Americans will have phenotype differences, I would say that phenotype difference would just be being mixed, but other countries such as France and Sweden are experiencing the same. In terms of culture, while America is super diverse, there already exists an American culture and identity. Most Americans who are at least 3rd generation are mutts. A reason to identify as \"part-German, part-Mexican, part-Greek\", isn't to \"claim\" that ethnicity. Rather it's a way to recognize that everyone is American whether they are Native, their ancestors came over on the Mayflower, or they \"just got off the boat\" yesterday, as long as they identify as such and believe in the \"ideals\" of the country. And the  \"mixed white American\" isn't anymore \"American\" than the Chinese American or African American, Polish American (or shock) the American with Asian, European, and African ancestors.",

Actually the reason why Nuevo Leon is no longer \u201cwhite-majority\u201d is because of immigrants from Southern and Central Mexico, and not because of people indigenous to modern-day North-Western Mexico/Southern Texas. Also many of those peoples were in constant war with Mexicans/New Spaniards; to them, Mexicans were no different than Americans: foreigners who settled in and took over their land, who spoke a completely different language, followed a completely different religion, and overall had a completely different culture. It\u2019s time people realize Mexico\u2019s a colonial state just like America.",

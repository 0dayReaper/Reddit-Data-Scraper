There were exhausting negotiations between the Netherlands and Prussia in 1814-1815 (taking a break to defeat Napoleon for the second time). The general idea was that the Netherlands should get a reasonable zone around the Meuse river, so that it would be connected to Maastricht, its fortress in the south.\n\nBoth sides claimed the zinc mine in Kelmis. As a compromise, a triangular area south of the Vaalserberg became a condominium called Neutral Moresnet, shared between the United Netherlands and Prussia, later between Belgium and Germany. This meant that the Vaalserberg used to be the border point between four countries from 1839 to 1914.\n\nThis region used to be such a patchwork of territories that the name Limburg was borrowed from a medieval duchy which was further to the south. After Belgian independence, the eastern part joined the Netherlands, which was the result of negotiations with the major powers again, not the choice of the locals.",

It's so flat that people for over 100 years thought the highest point was another point in the field a few hundred meters away where they built a monument. And it's still so flat that M\u00f8lleh\u00f8j is actually on some dude's farm right between his field and barn.\n\nIf you visited and didn't already know it was the highest point (or saw the written signs) then you might not even realise you're on a hill (which you barely are).",

Although, there are sometimes non-Arabic derived versions of words. For example, you can either say zumo (from Arabic) or jugo (not from Arabic). Alberca (Arabic) or pila/piscina (not). Depends a lot on what variety of Spanish you speak.",

And different regions adapted different words.\n\nSo you have to name a water pool used for recreational purposes. Some places adopted piscina from latin, which is related to pisces (fish), and refers to water pools used to breed fish for eating.\n\nAnd in some other places they used alberca from arabic, which is the name given to water pools used for irrigation.\n\nAs you are naming something new, both are reasonable aproximations, and it will simply be a matter of choice.",

While in Portugal, even the south was a less populated region, with low population density and much less important. That's why it's normal for Spain to have more influence since it incorporated the core of Al-Andaluz into its territory.",

I'd be willing to bet that half of the words on the list aren't even necessarily the preferred vernacular for any given distinct region. Perhaps Sicilians have a stronger Arabic influence than the majority of northern Italians, while Neapolitans might still retain a Greek derived word for a household item that has an agreed common Italian synonym.",

I imagine the strong Greek association is the reason.. the Greeks and Middle East have always had \u201ca thing\u201d going on.\n\nFalse.\n\nThe \"Middle East\" is as big as Europe. Greek has high historic contact with *Egypt and the Levant,* but prior to the Arabization of those regions, when they still spoke Ancient Egyptian, Aramaic, Phoenician, etc.\n\nSecondly, Greek itself has few Arab loan words.  The Greek and Arabic languages have historically had very limited contact. The Arabian peninsula is very far (Stockholm is closer than Riyadh), and historic contact with that region is practically non-existent. Most Arabic loanwords in Greek were borrowed indirectly via Turkish.\n\nThirdly, Greek doesn't have many loanwords from Middle Eastern languages, except Turkish. [According to one study](https://sinaahmadi.github.io/posts/foreign-loanwords-in-modern-greek.html), about 60% of loanwords into \\[Modern\\] Greek come from Romance languages (combination of Latin, Italian + dialects, French), and about 20% from Turkish. About 5% of loanwords come from Persian and Semitic (Hebrew, Aramaic, Arabic, other) languages combined.\n\nThe Greek language has historically exerted *outgoing* influence, not incoming (with the exception of Latin/Romance and Turkish. *Not Semitic*).\n\nEdit:\n\nWhy the downvotes? The infographic itself says that Arabic loanwords are few.\n\nArabic didn't reach Egypt/Levant until long after Greek colonization of Southern Italy and influence on the Etruscans and Romans.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, before the loss of Egypt and the Levant to the Arab invaders, Greek was the lingua franca of those areas under Byzantine control.",

I would actually expect _Arabic_ to have lots of loanwords from Greek, because, as you say, the Lingua Franca in the Levant, Egypt, North Africa, etc. was Greek. Then there\u2019s the fact that during and prior to the Islamic Golden Age, Muslim scholars placed a great emphasis on the translation of Greek, Latin, and Persian (but mostly Greek) philosophical, scientific, and medical texts into Arabic. This process would undoubtedly have introduced a ton of new vocabulary into Arabic. A lot of words that people assume are Arabic in origin are themselves derived from Greek.",

The total number is likely to be in the several hundred range.\n\nOf course, this does not include the somewhat universal Arabic words like algebra or alcohol that exist in most languages, nor the Arabic words that were diffused long ago through Latin or Greek. I feel if you take these loanwords into consideration in the same way, the numbers on the map for Spanish, Portuguese, French, and English would be much lower.\n\nNot to forget, the Maltese language was originally one of the dialects of Siculo-Arabic. On Sicily and its other islands, the Arabic dialect was gradually replaced by a Latinized Sicilian.",

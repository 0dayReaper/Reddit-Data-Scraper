It had this as a caption.\n\n\"If (like me) you enjoy looking at maps, you might sometimes wonder why a map looks a the way it does. The events leading to a certain demographic being more common here, or a border being drawn there, can often be very complex, and fascinating. Here I\u2019ve gathered 6 maps of the US state of Alabama. Together, these maps tell a story that links a coastline from the time of the dinosaurs, to modern political demographics, via one of the darkest periods of American history.\n\nMap 1 shows us the Cretaceous sediments of Alabama. These sediments are rocks and minerals laid down along the swampy southern coast of the continent of Appalachia, which existed around 100 million years ago. North America had not yet formed at this time.\n\nMap 2 shows the location of Blackland Prairie soil. This soil is known for its high fertility, as a result of the nutrients deposited during the Cretaceous period.\n\nMap 3 shows us modern farm sizes in Alabama. The largest farms (shown in red) can be found in areas with the most fertile soil. This shows us how economically important Blackland Prairie soil is.\n\nMap 4 shows slave populations according to the 1860 census. At that time, slaves accounted for 45% of the state\u2019s population. Only 3% of the state population was made up of free Black citizens. In the darkest regions of the map, enslaved people accounted for over 80% of the population. Slaves mainly worked on cotton plantations, and these plantations were most common in the areas with the most fertile soil.\n\nMap 5 shows us the modern Black population of Alabama. The darkest red areas show more than 44% of the population of the region is Black. Despite the 150 years between these maps, these is still a close correlation between the historic slave populations, and the modern Black populations.\n\nAnd finally map 6 shows us the results of the 2020 election. Areas with large Black populations are much more likely to vote for the Democratic party (shown in blue). This trend continues to the east and west of Alabama, along the so called \u201cBlack Belt\u201d of the southern USA, and along the buried coastline of the Cretaceous continent of Appalachia.\n\nWhen we look at maps and data about the modern world, it\u2019s easy to forget that everything about our world has been dictated and shaped by the events of history, and prehistory. From ancient continents to terrible atrocities, our world is a product of its past, and understanding that past can be key to helping us better understand the present.\"",

Regardless of what species survives, in a 100 million years, *homo sapien sapiens* will have impacted what the world looks like, perhaps influencing systems in a subtle but pervasive way.  \n\nOK,. That out of the way, I'm going to take a turn here. If our entire billions-strong species is simply \"meant\" to contribute overall to life 100 million years hence (I'm obviously over simplifying here), maybe we should all stop worrying so much about useless shit like people judging us and just relax.  Maybe we should just *go for it* whatever \"it\" is.",

It is also 'to be read'\n\nSo 'legend' and 'legend' have the same meaning, just in a different context.\n\nInteresting huh.",

Where the fall line and rivers would intersect, cities would form (Augusta, Macon, and Columbus in Georgia).  Cities would bring in more slaves/former slaves for work etc.\n\nSo it not only influenced it via agriculture but also later via industry.\n\nEdit: I posted this before i fell asleep.  The faster currents also made water powered mills more productive.  The goods could be made upstream in the mills and then moved down via boats in the calmer waters.\n\nAll of this happened, because of a prehistoric shoreline.",

This made it probably the best place on earth for civilizations to develop and grow, as they could trade over the sea to a huge number of cities. It is no coincidence that ancient civilizations such as Greece, Egypt and Rome were founded there. And modern day Europe is still largely benefiting from the same situation. The entire continent is surrounded by water while also being in a nice temperature and filled with rivers. It's basically the largest, most fertile peninsula in the world.",

Basically, after the civil war, Princeville, North Carolina became one of the first black towns in America. However, because all of the obvious \u201cgood\u201d land for development was already inhabited, many black communities were forced to settle in less than favourable lands. Because of this, you often see marginalized demographics living in geologically burdened areas. In the case of Princeville, it resides within a floodplain, outside the white town of Tarboro which sits on the high ground.\n\nAdditionally there is [this](https://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/9/kastner_najafi_weizman.php) article which talks about neighbouring Israeli and Palestinian settlements, wherein the Israeli government develops on a hilltop as a way to weaponize landscape, through a form of psychologic oppression, in addition to hostile urban planning meant to disrupt the development of the Palestinian town.\n\nBasically, in most cases, at the internal city scale, to a larger city to city scale, you can look at basic land elevation as an indicator of oppression or class divide.",

They are alluding to what's called \"environmental determinism\" and it's a theory that has been widely criticized for decades. Even though Jared Diamond and others mentioned in this thread have resurrected the idea in recent years with popular books, there are still many problems with the theory and similar kinds of thinking. Here's a good comment and thread about it: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/59ndxy/why\\_is\\_environmental\\_determinism\\_wrong/",

It, like many of the major east coast cities is at the fall line where the piedmont meets the coastal plain and river navigation becomes hard.\n\nBut its also at the head of the Chesapeake Bay - a body which exists because a meteor hit earth 40 million years ago at its mouth, xasuing the local rivers to all converge  there instead.\n\nThis in turn allowed Baltimore to be relatively far inland (so easier access to farms goods) but also with access to the ocean- making it one of the major ports and for a time cities in the US.",

There were black mayors, city council members, sheriffs and police, county government, etc., right after November 1865, just since the South hadn't yet worked out how to deal with emancipation, and hadn't put in proper apartheid-esque measures yet. \n\n\nThe PBS show \"Finding Your Roots\" has some good examples of this. Poll taxes, literacy tests, redistricting, terror campaigns, the KKK, etc., hadn't been thought of yet in 1865, so very temporarily, freed slaves had only minimal legal barriers stopping them from getting into politics/government/law enforcement. Many did have education of some kind, and money (often because they were the offspring of the slave owner, who sometimes took a liking to them and provided a decent life), and many of them had skills beyond basic labor, bought land legally, and employed other freed slaves. And of course, the Union Army was still encamped in the South for some time after the war, and provided at least some protection for those mentioned above, who wanted to advance themselves.",

And as we know this is true, in astronomy we see how fragile and how slim was the possibility of the universe, and the earth, life, intelligence, humans, you or I and so on, its a miracle! . ( I know I didn't did justice to Leibnitz idea but I think is worth saying bad than not at all)",

Maybe it's also related to why in ancient times, using divination people tried to explain everything in the past and future just watching signs in nature. Interesting.",

Like a century ago, English maps would indeed refer to Aachen as Aix-la-Chapelle, but also to Antwerp as Anvers. Most of these have been changed to at least reflect endonyms instead of French exonyms. Which makes Ieper still being called Ypres in English all the weirder, and agonizing for the Flemish.",

I live in south coast region of Massachusetts a more conservative area of the state in a very Liberal state. The area I live in is by no means conservative in the greater definition of the country. The state legislature district I live in is so gerrymandered that it considers a small town of 10,000 rural people 50 miles from Boston to be a part of urban towns of 65,000 people only 10 miles from Boston. The towns have nothing in common, none of the same needs or concerns and of course our little voice is drown out. The state has gerrymandered this whole rural farm area of the state and stuck it to big cities far away. Of course people in Brockton and Fall River and New Bedford don\u2019t care about farm land and water when they are worried about gang violence and drugs. This is the problem with dividing to suit the needs of the politicians and NOT THE PEOPLE!",

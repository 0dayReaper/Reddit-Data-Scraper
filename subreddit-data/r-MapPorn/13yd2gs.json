Obviously that was a process that took time, but compared to the Central Asian countries it's much easier to get to places like Germany, France, or Sweden from somewhere like Moldova than from somewhere like Turkmenistan.  Of course immigration certainly isn't the only factor, but I don't think it can be ignored.",

But even if Chinese growth slows to like a more normal 2-4% per annum as part of a gradual slowdown/stagnation, well, China still has a massive economy with lots of scientific and technical talent and expertise and a military which is now reaping the rewards of a couple decades of robust investment. In other words, they are a threat even if they do start stagnating. And they certainly have ambition!\n\nBut this is all very speculative, isn't it?",

What we have seen since 2017 is the government cracking down hard on any separatitst and terrorist organisations, which brought a lot of colleteral damage with it. But, with all its cost, it seems to have worked, there havent been any terrorist attacks since 2017.

If you referred to the riot in 2008, I think it was mostly facilitated by the fear of a potentially huge influx of Han immigrants in the future. If you really been to the Tibetan autonomy region within China, you will find the views toward China are actually very diverse. Most are indifferent but some are surprisingly patriotic. I mean the popular images in the West of Tibetans being angry and suffering are mostly shaped by the diaspora Tibetan community who master English while their compatriots within China cannot.",

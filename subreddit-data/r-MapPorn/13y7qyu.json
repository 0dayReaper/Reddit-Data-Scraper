            "comment": "Once a bustling trade node, Miletus Bay slowly disappeared under alluvium silt deposits flowing in through the Maeander River. The planned city Priene, which had been founded originally in around 350 BCE, already stopped being a harbour city in the 1st century BCE. The eponymous city Miletus lost it's harbour some time during the 3rd century CE. Both cities would be abandoned as their economic base fell away.\n\nSource: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priene)\n\nI was just stunned when I happened upon this map on Wikipedia and decided I had to share it somewhere. This map was previously posted 9 years ago, hope mods will allow a repost now.",

Thales was said to have studied in Egypt and advised Pythagoras to do the same, he was considered the most prominent of the seven sages of Greece and inspired subsequent philosophers like Plato and Aristotle. \n\nIonian Greek cities were reluctant vassals of Lydia before they fucked around and found out with the Persians. And when the Lydian king was recruiting to initially bring the fight to the Persians Miletus abstained as they had enough autonomy even under the control of Lydia to push back against the king. Thales allegedly even advised all of the Ionian Greek states to come together in a form of democracy with representatives from each state and collectively they'd make decisions. But the other city states didn't want to lose that autonomy and they even contributed to the doomed Lydian invasion force to which Persia clapped back and destroyed the empire effectively taking control of Ionia Greece. \n\nEach of the city states pleaded for independence and mercy but none received it except Miletus, who presciently didn't contribute to the Lydian war effort and they maintained their quasi independent status under Persia. I dedicate a future episode of my podcast to all of Thales' achievements but he wasn't the only notable Milesian. His pupil Anaximander made huge progress on top of Thales' in relation to geometry, astronomy, and physics and he allegedly coined the term apeiron, which is cool, and he's claimed to have created the first map of the world. Anaximenes followed him up then and gave further contributions. \n\nIn short, yes, Miletus was awesome and way underrepresented.",

It's part of a totally different series because I can't help but jump around between interesting topics, but I dive in deep. My next series will be focused on space and how it affects both the planet and our behavior. How does Thales of Miletus relate to that? Well you'll have to listen to find out!

The sea eventually broke through the dune barrier and rapidly eroded the swamps forming a large bay called the Zuiderzee, which was then largely reclaimed by the Dutch. \n\nThe coastline and layout of the rivers in northern China has changed dramatically over history. The Yellow River has changed course by hundreds of miles several times, as recently as the 1940s it entered the sea on the other side of Shandong peninsula, and silt buildup has caused the coastline to move east dramatically, especially in Jiangsu and on the coast of the Bo Hai. The land on which cities like Shanghai and Tianjin sits didn't exist in antiquity.\n\nOn the east coast of England there has been significant coastal erosion, with several towns largely falling into the sea, most famously Dunwich which was once one of the most important ports in the country. \n\nI've always found these sort of relatively rapid geological changes really cool, like the land isn't just an unchanging background for history, but something that changes on a human timescale.",

It was an Ionian Greek foundation in antiquity, but by 500BCE it was within the Achaemenid Persian Empire. The Greek cities of Ionia (not to be confused with the Ionian Sea, which is the other side of Greece entirely) revolted against their Persian overseers and Miletus, being the foremost city of the region, was made an example of when the Persians came along to put down the revolt, and destroyed in 494BCE (it was refounded a generation later). This was known as the Ionian Revolt.\n\nWhen the Ionians appealed to mainland Greece for help against the Persians, it precipitated the Greco-Persian Wars that are better known, with Darius of Persia invading by sea in 490BCE and being defeated by an Athenian army when they landed at Marathon, and his successor Xerxes invading by both land and sea in 480-479BCE. That's when the battle of Thermopylae was, in 480BCE, and it served to hold up the Persian army long enough to give the Greek cities that were to stand against Persia time to muster and assemble. The other key battles of this war were Artemesion, a naval battle off the north coast of Euboea which was roughly concurrent with the battle of Thermopylae, from which the Greeks retreated after hearing of the Greek defeat at Thermopylae; the battle of Salamis, a naval battle near the island of Salamis, which is near Athens, which the Greeks won in part due to the narrow strait giving the Persians little room to manouver; and the battle of Plataea, a land battle in the summer of 479BCE which the Greeks won after an initial retreat thanks to Spartans breaking through the Persian lines and killing the Persian general Mardonius and his bodyguard.",

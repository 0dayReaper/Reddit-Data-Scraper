Pouring more fuel onto the bonfire, throwing guns and bombs and money forever and ever no matter how many die and no matter how long this goes on for will not bring peace.\n\nThis war will end in talks, and the sooner they start, the better. How many people will die before then, families forced to leave their homes, or children turned into corpses before this happens?",

They clearly didn't stand a chance, Germany has advanced rapidly through Europe and they had a firm grasp on it, not to mention allies like the USSR. The US should've stayed neutral and the UK should've decided to negotiate, with Mr. Hitler. Imagine if all those lives could've been spared. They could've spared Europe from 5 long years of war.\n\nAnd no, I'm not using the \"Nazi card\" here, it's an allegory from a past war. Russia is not Nazi Germany, but they're certainly our enemies right now.",

There have been many other wars; is WW2 the only lens through which you view conflict?\n\nThat was\u2026 a world war. Unlike any other we\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s not comparable to this war.\n\nAs it happens, US assistance to the UK was incredibly controversial and came very late and at a huge price to the UK. It was, for a long time, very unpopular in the US to get involved in a European war. Whereas in Ukraine, the only acceptable opinion is arming Ukraine forever and ever, no matter how many die, no matter how long it takes, and if you attempt to debate this or disagree with this, you\u2019re a Putin apologist and an appeaser. This is not a sensible attitude to war",

Humiliating Ukraine into submission is not a good way of securing long-term peace. Maybe this is something Putin should hear a bit more often.  It could convince Putin to pull back his troops maybe rather than continue committing atrocities again and again?    \n\n\nI'm also curious to know why you think that Putin would be inclined to give back the Donbas, Crimea and most of the occupied areas just through talks and negotiations. Putin wanted to conquer the whole of Ukraine after all.",

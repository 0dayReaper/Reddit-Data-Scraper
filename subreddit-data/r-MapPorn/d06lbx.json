                    "comment": "A few reasons why \n\n1. Massive inequality. Racial/economic etc. Even besides the actual economic effects, this often creates a social culture of crime because many poor people feel that their situation is unfair. If you're in a poor country like, say, Bangladesh, where nearly everyone is poor and there isn't such a big 50/50 divide between rich and poor, its an entirely different mentality. \n\n2. Lots of easily accessible guns. Gangs are bad everywhere, but when you put guns into the situation, they are able to exert a tremendous amount of power against both each other and their local communities. A guy comes to your store with a baseball bat demanding a monthly extortion rate? Okay bud, sure, get the fuck out. They come through a with a gun? You're gonna pay. It also makes it just generally easier to kill, obviously. Its less risky to take someone out. \n\n3. Arguably the worst police in the world. Police in Rio kill nearly 200 civilians a month. It is absolute insanity with them, they are their own gang. \n\n4. Drugs. This applies to all Latin america countries basically. Its why the region stands out so dramatically in terms of murder rates. And of course it applies to Brazil, and add in all of the other factors, it just adds up to an extremely high homicide rate. \n\nBut more than anything? Its cultural. Decades of extremely high crime rates have lead to many areas having a culture of crime. I've seen this in my own country (Russia, which used to the be homicide capital of the world) as well. Crime eventually becomes a vicious cycle, where the newer generations grow up in it and turn to crime because it becomes normalized in their culture.",

When I lived in Brazil (1980's), there was a sharp line that I noticed where people born before roughly 1950 were simply illiterate.  That is today quite rare.\n\nWhat holds the country back is corruption.  It certainly isn't the lack of raw materials.  I love how one state in Brazil is called \"General Mines\" like if Michigan was called \"General Motors\".  It was the original gold rush and still produces metals of many kinds.\n\nI still have hope for the future of the country, and I understand the frustration of younger people there.  Put it in perspective though and it isn't so bad.  Certainly not poverty like Somalia or Chad.",

There was a bomb in somalia I think last year which killed 500~ people, that ALONE would give it an extra homicide rate bump of 5-6 per 100,000. Let alone all of the conflicts between militias and terror groups and pirate groups which result in thousands of deaths a year in Somalia but aren't counted as homicides. For countries such as Somalia, if you were to count all of the violent deaths as homicides, it would likely be nearly, if not above, 100 per 100,000. \n\nJust an example, in Iraq, the homicide rate in 2017 was about 9.8, mostly from martial disputes, gangs, street crime etc. Normal homicide causes. But if you count the war against ISIS, it rises into the hundreds.",

The cops in the movie are fascist, violent, often corrupt thugs, but their actions make sense in the context of the system. Some people even ended up cheering for them.

The film is a semi-fictional account of the Batalh\u00e3o de Opera\u00e7\u00f5es Policiais Especiais (BOPE), the Special Police Operations Battalion of the Rio de Janeiro Military Police, analogous to the American SWAT teams. It is the second feature film and first fiction film of Padilha, who had previously directed the documentary Bus 174. The script was written by Br\u00e1ulio Mantovani (City of God) and Padilha, based on the book Elite da Tropa by sociologist Luiz Eduardo Soares and two former BOPE captains, Andr\u00e9 Batista and Rodrigo Pimentel.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

He was just a jogger, but my first instinct was to pull my SO to cross the street.\n\n\nI was about 16 or so when I truly realized having this kind of paranoia (well, it's only paranoia when you're out of here) isn't normal in the rest of the world.",

People go to work and fear of coming back alive, specially if you commute using public transport (famous ''camioneticas'') or you are in a war zone district like Petare (Caracas).\n\nThe political situation is worsening everyday, lots of censure, desinformation and killings, our opposition is the most idiotic and corrupt of the world, I don't believe in anyone of those c\\*\\*\\*\\*, they are from the same nest. The public services are another pain, from June to August electrical rationating to ALL the country except Caracas because there live the worst slums of Venezuela, they would nuke the government if they wanted to. Water only one day of the week, the slowest internet of the world (average 1mbps) and it only goes hell level if you live in Zulia State, 12 hours a day with no electricity and no water at all with 35 grades of caribbean sunshine.\n\nThe **inflation** is the cherry on the cake, +[1.000.000.000](https://1.000.000.000)% of misery to everyone. Doing business here is near impossible, nobody can buy anything and everything is traded with $ because our currency (Bolivar - BsS) does not hold any value. Black market is the only way to survive here. Education worsening everyday, no teachers, low quality and painful low salaries.\n\nThat's why every single soul here is emigrating if they can, a large percentage of Venezuelan population has european ancestry (I'm spanish thanks to my father) and so on. Lots of people going to over-crowded Colombia, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Spain and USA. Chile, Ecuador and Peru starting requiring VISA the last month.\n\nWorking very hard to flee to Spain next year when I finish my high school studies. I'm from Maracay (1h and half to Caracas) so I am not in the worst part of the country compared Maracaibo.

That is, does every grey country have a lower annual homicide count than every blue country? Because, if not, then the choice of countries seems relatively arbitrary and, consequently, easily manipulated.  \nThat's not to say that the murder rate in Brazil is low (it's pretty clear that it isn't). I'm mainly wondering if it would be possible to select a smaller set of countries and still have a similarly large total.",

Specifically, it pertains to the long-standing disagreement between the Byzantine emperors residing in Constantinople and the Holy Roman emperors in Germany during the Middle Ages.",

Charlemagne was a foreigner who was anointed by the Pope for political reasons. He had no claim over the surviving Roman polity.",

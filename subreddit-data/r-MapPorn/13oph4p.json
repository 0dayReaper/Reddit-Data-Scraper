All those problems are kind of moving in the past, but slowly, because of the lack of young people.\n\nAlso, the bulk of the population is in the other regions. Only Southeast had large population but the major polluters - lignite mines and power plants, and oil refinery, are there.",

Is it really that bad there?\n\nMore people doing manual labour in eastern europe including bulgaria.. .. meaning degrading their bodies/health.. Typical the countries were office work is the most prevalent.. people live the longest.. In many countries in europe were people live long today , they used to die early in the day when most of the workforce did manual labour. Back in the 1950/60s when there were much more manual labour in europe.. expected living age was about 70 years in many of those countries were people live to they are 80+",

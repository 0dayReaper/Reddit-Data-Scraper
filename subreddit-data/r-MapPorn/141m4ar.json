However, there exists a place called \"Speaker's Corner\" where demonstrations (primarily speech) are legal.\n\nSingapore is a free democracy. Freedom House (which does have a US Western bias, so you would expect it to be harsher on Singapore) identities that elections are free from voter suppression, electoral fraud, and such.\n\nWhether they are fair is another thing. The Institute of Policy Studies polled that people in Singapore believe that elections are fair, and 82% are satisfied with their democracy.\n\nThere are some issues. Singapore has incredibly harsh libel laws that have prevented some Opposition from running, which is expressed in the before mentioned IPS poll at a quatre. However, it should be noted that these libel laws are applied fairly given that the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index puts them as the 5th least corrupt.\n\nOf all claimed Democracies around the world, Singapore is far from the worse. Not only is it incredibly prosperous, safe, and equal (Gini of 0.36), but it's Democracy is definitely free, most are satisfied with it, and it's lack of fairness is counteracted by very low corruption.\n\nFreedom House: [https://freedomhouse.org/country/singapore](https://freedomhouse.org/country/singapore)\n\nIPS Poll (Article on it): [https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/most-sporeans-say-elections-are-fair-offer-genuine-choice-1-4-feel-opposition-candidates](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/most-sporeans-say-elections-are-fair-offer-genuine-choice-1-4-feel-opposition-candidates)\n\nSatisfaction with Democracy: [https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/sporeans-most-satisfied-among-people-polled-in-17-economies-with-how-well](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/sporeans-most-satisfied-among-people-polled-in-17-economies-with-how-well)  \n\n\nCorruption Index: [https://www.cpib.gov.sg/press-room/press-releases/310123-singapore-ranked](https://www.cpib.gov.sg/press-room/press-releases/310123-singapore-ranked)\n\nGini Coefficient: https://www.statista.com/statistics/951976/singapore-gini-coefficient-after-tax/",

That being the difference views on political and civil rights, and economic and social rights.\n\nThe difference between these two is not as arbitrary as you think. There UN Covenants that outline both, and notably we can see that the PRC has not ratified the former, while the USA has not ratified the later. Just as China does not follow political and civil rights outlined by the UN, the USA have not does not follow economic and cultural rights.\n\nThi isn't to say that the USA is as bad as the PRC, or particularly bad at all. I wouldn't say how the PRC treats the former is anything like how the USA treats the latter, but it gets the point of this cultural understanding of democracy across. And importantly, Singapore **is** similar.\n\nIt's a pretty common domestic issue in the US that they have subpar social security and labour rights. And this generally extends to much of the West. A large reason is pretty simple. Between the freedom to protest and the freedom to social security, people in the West would nearly always choose the former. In the East, this is pretty much the reverse.\n\nAs I said before, the USA - while being one of the worse in the wets if economic and social rights - is not bad. Generally, the West is less extreme in their interpretation of democracy, and thus does not fall into as bad of pitfalls. The state of social security in USA is not as bad as authoritarianism is in the PRC for example.\n\nSingapore serves as perhaps the only example of not only an existing democracy base of these values, but one of incredibly success. Their social security is world class, their corruption is some of the lowest in the world, their democratic satisfaction is generally pretty high. Many of these factors are only rivaled by the Nordics. And ofcourse, they are incredibly prosperous.",

When asking \"what is democracy?\" Singapore has been the one effective and modern example I can point to that isn't a Western style Liberal Democracy that emphasis civil and political rights over economic and social rights.\n\nIt's a system of democracy that is uniquely suited to its population's unique culture, akin to the Nordic Model which has been the closest to another example that isn't a liberal democracy.\n\nHonestly, I'm sorry that you're being downvoted by a bunch of Westerners that do see Western liberal democracy as **the** definition of democracy, but there are those that do look at Singapore with curious intrigue of a truly brilliant political system up there with the best of liberal democracies.",

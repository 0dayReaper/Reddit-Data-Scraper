I used to be petrified I\u2019d get lost. I moved there and was utterly terrified to go outside. Carried my A2Z everywhere. Planned journeys before I went. Then one day I just kind of stopped caring. I actively tried to get lost. I became one of those strange creatures just going about their life. London is massive. But it\u2019s the a place I think everyone from the U.K. should live at least once in their life.",

Place it on one end of the country you're considering. For our sake let's say we start with the *\"horizontal\"-ish* line on the picture above and put it north of Scotland. At the moment 100% of population lives below it and 0% above it.\n2. now move it all the way down to France. Now 0% of population lives below it and 100% above.\n3. population is distributed continously, or, using mathematician's language, **population is a continous function of the line's location**. Using [langrange theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_value_theorem) we can say that if there are two extremes of 0% and 100%, then there must be a point where the split is 50-50.\n4. now repeat this for the second line, which can be any angle as well. Let's say we want the second line to be perpendicular to the first one, let's call it *vertical-ish*. Repeating the steps above we arrive at a point where the vertical line bisects the population.\n5. we now have two lines which both **individually** divide the country into two sets of two equally populous regions.\n6. ~~but how do we know that the four regions created when considering both lines at the same time are equally populated?~~\n7. the vertical-ish line divides the country into blue-red and green-yellow sectors which each house 34 million people.\n8. the horizontal-ish line divides the country into blue-yellow and green-red sectors which each house 34 million people as well.\n9. We can know write two equations for the two ways the blue sector is described:blue+red=34 mlnblue+yellow=34mln\n10. Therefore:blue+red=blue+yellow\n11. Thereforered=yellow\n12. ~~Repeat for other sectors, this proves all 4 sectors are equally populous~~",

In [Scotland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland) it refers to corporate entities whose [legality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law) is peculiar to Scotland. ([Scottish law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_law) was protected and preserved as distinct from laws of [England](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/England) under the [Acts of Union of 1707](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Union_1707).) Pronunciation is the same as the English language word [borough](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borough), which is a near [cognate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate) of the Scots word. The identical English word Burgh (in place names such as [Bamburgh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamburgh), [Carrawburgh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrawburgh) and [Dunstanburgh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunstanburgh)) sounds exactly like the Scots Burgh, with the emphasis on the 'r'[[clarification needed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify)]. Another variant pronunciation, [/br\u028cf/](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English) ([\ufffc](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:En-borough.ogg)[listen](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/En-borough.ogg)), is heard in several Cumbrian place names, e.g. [Burgh by Sands](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgh_by_Sands), [Longburgh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longburgh), [Drumburgh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drumburgh), [Mayburgh Henge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayburgh_Henge). \n\nThe English language borough, like the Scots Burgh, is derived from the same [Old English language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English_language) word [burh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burh) (whose dative singular and nominative/accusative plural form byrig sometimes underlies modern place-names, and which had dialectal variants including \"burg\"; it was also sometimes confused with beorh, beorg, 'mound, hill', on which see Hall 2001, 69\u201370). The [Old English](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English) word was originally used for a fortified town or proto-[castle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle) (e.g. at [Dover Castle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dover_Castle) or [Burgh Castle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgh_Castle_Roman_Site)) and was related to the verb beorgan ([cf.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cf.) Dutch and German bergen) 'to keep, save, make secure'. In the [German language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language), [Burg](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burg) means '[castle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle)' or '[fortress](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortress)', though so many towns grew up around castles that it almost came to mean [city](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/City), and is incorporated into many [placenames](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenames), such as [Hamburg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg), [Flensburg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flensburg) and [Strasburg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasburg,_Germany).",

They are trying to enable hiring domestic help for under minimum wages right now, but immigration rules are getting stricter and getting any sort of long term/permanent visa is getting harder and harder with every change to rules - it would be political suicide to try to open immigration more in current climate. They want only highly educated westerners in pretty much, but those are people who don't normally stay here forever due to crazy work hours (and those are people who can get much higher pay elsewhere). It might change 20-30 years in future but I think its gonna be way too late by then.",

Solve one problem, you solve both. If you just solve the population size portion, you only delay the issue.\n\n\u201cWe have too many people\u201d is a myth that has been thoroughly debunked. There\u2019s very little truth to it unless you mean \u201cwe have too many people in certain areas.\u201d\n\nAlso no, immigration again cannot solve the issue. You can\u2019t equally distribute population to where it is needed with immigration, nor can you adequately control the immigrating demographics. Plus, immigrants don\u2019t have ties to the old people already at the host country, so it doesn\u2019t solve the fact that you have aging people with few or no children to help care for them in their latter years. This isn\u2019t only happening in rich western countries, it\u2019s happening even in places like China, as the map shows. It\u2019s happening in places where immigration is wholly undesirable, like Russia where the birth rates are low AND people are leaving.\n\nWe can engineer solutions to climate change, yet we cannot engineer more people, or demographic compositions of the population. It\u2019s a much bigger deal than you think, and you just saying \u201cmeh no problem\u201d is pretty ironic because it sounds like people who say \u201cclimate change isn\u2019t a big deal\u201d",

I remember reading that in countries where the State subsidizes having children the fertility increasing was not substantial. Some people just want to live with no burdens. Call it hedonism or different priorities, I suppose we should accept this phenomenon as it is. However, the problem is not \"people are having less children\" but \"people are having less children AND in some countries we depend on young people to provide retirement funds AND there won't be enough professionals to take care of old people\". In my country, for example, we need like two working people to provide enough money for one retired person, but right now the ratio is like &lt;2. In the next year it will be one person working and one retired person, and we won't be able to sustain public pensions.",

Plus, millions of Nepalis (mostly men) work overseas in the Middle East and Southeast Asia as manual laborers, which has also led to increased participation of women in the workforce, reduction in poverty (albeit not very sustainable) and a drop in birth rates.\n\nI remember my parents\u2019 generation having at least 4-5 siblings.

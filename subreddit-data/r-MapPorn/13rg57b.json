I can say that the stereotypes are fairly one-sided, having family in eastern WA and OR, and spent a lot of time working/exploring in Idaho. There's a lot of amazing places and people out there if you look a little deeper than what the news tells you and actually spend some time with them. I'd say the same exact thing to bigoted folks east of the mountains when they shit on Portland, etc. Really interesting, thanks for sharing.",

The US still legalized it nationwide before Germany, Australia, Switzerland, Austria, Finland, Ireland, and even before all UK jurisdictions did.  And some western countries, like Italy, still haven't legalized it.  Many countries had situations where some jurisdictions within those countries legalized SSM before the whole nation did, inclucing the US, UK, Denmark, Brazil, Mexico, etc.  The first US jurisdictions were aligned with the earliest European countries &amp; Canada in legalizing.",

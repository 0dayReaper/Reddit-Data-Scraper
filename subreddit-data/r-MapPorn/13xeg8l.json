I thought I might make an interactive version where you can actually view details about the country such as the name of the country in the target language instead of just colors.\n\nHere's a [link](https://ashleyliew.com/interaktiv-landernamen/) to the website where I have the tool up (note it's best to view on desktop). Currently I only have data for German but I'm planning on adding some more languages. I don't know if this is interesting at all, but please let me know if there's anything I should change/add/remove!\n\nAlso it's my first time commenting here (and Reddit for that matter) so apologies if this is not the right place to be sharing.",

The existence of other groups do not change that fact. Differentiating these two is as stupid as claiming English and Englander. Do you differentiate between Croats and Croatians? No one does.\n\nHerzegovinian is a region, so Herzegovinian people from a region like Iberians. Herzegovinian is neither ethnic nor a religious term.\n\nPeople having a surnames after a foreign land or city are very common in all around the world. Nemec (German) is in top ten surnames in Czechia. Bo\u0161njak is one of the most common surnames in Croatia. A significant portion of Greeks have Turkish surnames. Your argument is invalid.\n\nThe truth is that Bosnians have been subjected to ethnic cleansing policies since 18th century.",

Specifically, I'm very interested in seeing the political boundary of Israel since inception, and how those boundaries have changed over subsequent decades.\n\nSecondly, but definitely less so, I'm interested in natural history maps, such as the evolution of the world from Panagea to today. I'd welcome any advice!",

Maps from major change to another since 1918.\n\nWhen it comes to Pangaea, there's one good [website](https://dinosaurpictures.org/ancient-earth#750) I found that you can jump between millions of years and see what is and where (with borders as they are now).\n\nI'm not sure if these are exactly what you were after but there's at least something!",

This is purposefully misleading.\n\nPerhaps there\u2019s disagreement, but I feel like this is precisely the type of graphic that could be regurgitated as a rallying call for lower US fuel taxes, stoking anger among the conservative political bloc at their opposition for not supporting such measures.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the graphic is factually incorrect\u2026 nor am I taking any stance in the use of liters as a volumetric measurement\u2026 I\u2019m just saying people in the US are dumb enough to misinterpret it.",

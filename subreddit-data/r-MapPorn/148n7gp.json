When the SoCreds collapsed, much of their support went to the BC Liberals rather than to the NDP, and the party gradually moved to the right, despite being led by the relatively moderate Gordon Campbell, Christy Clark and Andrew Wilkinson. When Kevin Falcon took over the leadership, they essentially decided to stop the pretense of being anything like Liberal so hence \"BC United\".",

For us in Newfoundland and Labrador, for example...\n\nTraditionally, Liberal = Confederate. Mostly rural, pro-Confederation with Canada in 1949, pro strip-mining St. John's for any government office that could possibly be set up in the middle of nowhere as a make-work project for some outport. That's changed since Harper, and St. John's has - federally and provincially - lurched toward to Liberal/NDP.\n\nProgressive Conservative, traditionally, was St. John's and other urban pockets around the island. Nationalist, as opposed to Confederate, passionately against Confederation with Canada in 1949. Very socially liberal (they implemented marriage equality, reduced our childhood poverty rate from worst in Canada to best in Canada, etc.). But, these days, they're tainted by Harper and association with the federal Conservatives and being actually socially right-wing, so they're done in St. John's. Rural areas that were traditionally Liberal are starting, after a couple of generations, to align with the Canadian norm of being right-wing in rural areas. So you'll see the PCs (and the federal Conservatives) start to gain ground in rural NL where they never could before. \n\nNDP and Independents are also-ran here. They will never form government. They'll just continue to do well in St. John's and Labrador (provincially and federally), where a majority of the population is consciously, passionately leftist. But they will never make in-roads in rural NL where issues are more literal (what price can ye get me on crab?)",

It's not similar to European parties who (unless i'm mistaken) or even American ones which have definitive federal and provincial/state branches. That isn't true in Canada, and so this map is deceiving in that way and doesn't mean a whole lot unless you're willing to overlook that fact.",

The one splash of orange you see is Banff-Canmore, a more progressive region than most of the rest of small-town Alberta.\n\nAnd in southern Ontario, while it looks mostly blue the large cities still went heavily Liberal and NDP (Liberal votes, being more spread out, didn't translate into as many seats as the NDP whose vote was concentrated in certain ridings)",

Where the liberals have consistently been re-elected and appeal to many of the concerns there because it guarantees their reelection. But this means that a large part of the country is somewhat ignored or have lackluster campaigns by the liberals and usually falls to the other parties who mirror the liberals approach and appeal to the wests concerns. This is why it will be incredibly difficult to find a liberal voter in say Alberta where almost the entire vote is split between the NDP(social Democrats) and the Conservatives since the majority of voters get pushed to either side because of their needs not being represented by the and the unenthusiastic campaigns by the liberals.( in my city I saw about 60+ NDP signs, 80+ UCP signs, 20+ Alberta part signs(Grassroots populists) and 2 Liberal signs.over here a vote liberal is somewhat considered a wasted vote and the other parties will try and sway you to their side, especially in the more competitive districts(one district in Calgary was decided by SEVEN VOTES)\n\nTL;DR\nThe liberals can secure an easy victory appealing to the eastern provinces so western provinces usually don\u2019t vote for them as much and turn to secondary parties. (Also local elections usually have more decisive voting and Trudeau\u2019s government has been declining in popularity in general)\n\nIncredibly close districts in Calgary: https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/looming-recounts-in-calgary-area-leave-final-seat-tallies-in-question/wcm/f2d3eb97-6240-4021-a836-25b7b2a7871e/amp/\n\nPast elections:\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Canadian_federal_election\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Canadian_federal_election\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Canadian_federal_election\n\n\n(Also I\u2019m not a political analysis so take this with a grain of salt as you should take any opinion from someone on Reddit)",

You get extremely divisive politics and a society where people\u2019s political affiliation is their identity (starting to happen here too as well). Also, when a single party controls more than 50% of Congress, they can pass all kinds of legislation that only favours their party. If the ruling party only controls, say 40% of the house, they have to collaborate and build consensus with other parties to pass legislation, which ensures that legislation is more likely to reflect the will of the people.",

And those shared ideas? I'd say most people on both sides aren't that represented by their parties. You're either voting for neo-liberals who might pass some vaguely progressive bills once in a while, or you're voting for social conservatives who'd ban gay marriage if they could get away with it. \n\nInterprovincial travel is different than interstate, Canada isn't the US. For starters, the second biggest province speaks a different language than most of the country, making migration from and to Quebec difficult. And in general there aren't many large cities in the country, so people coalesce in the handful of large ones. And the country is more spread out and provinces are larger, meaning it's more expensive or takes longer to travel.\n\nAlso, is interprovincial travel something that important? I'll take a more diverse democracy over people moving to Manitoba any day of the week.",

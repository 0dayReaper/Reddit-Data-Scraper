Was populated by settlers from Albania that later would refer as Arvanite that means Albanian. It's not really random, it declined in power after Ottoman conquest and a lot migrated in Italy forming the Albanian communities known as Arb\u00ebresh and others would later after 1821 assimilate heavily under Greek identity.",

The map says they were an ottoman tributary between 1674 and 1676 which doesn't seem to be true really but it is close.",

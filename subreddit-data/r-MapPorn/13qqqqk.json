Rockstar North is just one studio that is part of Rockstar Games UK. Rockstar North is not the only Rockstar Games UK studio that works on the GTA, hasn't been for over a decade. In fact, most of the studios that work on the GTA are not Scottish - 3 are English (which, until the renaming, all fell under the legal umbrella of \"Rockstar North\"), 2 are US-based, and 1 is Canadian. With the latest one, it's also safe to assume that a further one will be Indian and one more Scottish.",

The exception is Israel and Turkey(to some extent).  \nThe high labor participation of women in Africa is one of the reasons why the continent still has hope but only to some extent.  \nThe problem is how culture basically, how do I put it \"Conformity is King\" s the population to the point that aside from a few nations and regions (Christian Nigerians, some South Africans, some Kenyans, some Zimbabweans) culture and religion play a role in extinguishing the curiosity and drive many Africans have during teenagehood.   \nIt is not surprising that nations like Ghana for example, while at a glance, one may think the people are doing well, the reality is that the economy is dominated by foreigners with little benefit to the locals.  \nIn short, the high women labor participation makes Sub-Saharan Africa ripe for industrialization, much like China, where factory jobs were not seen as low class jobs attracted workers regardless of gender. (So long as they fix things like infrastructure, cost of power and cost of land)  \nHowever, whether Africa will move past this phase is debatable with the exception of Southern Nigeria, Kenya and if they get their sh\\*t together, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Much like Turkey probably never will because mindset plays a role.  \nFor a nation to become a developed nation, one has to shift towards making innovative products.  \nAnd such a mindset that is open to new concepts and ideas has to be nurtured for decades even before the country reaches that point.   \nSub-Saharan Africa as it is ,the attitude towards work is positive (which is a good thing) but the mindset towards thinking outside the box is extremely regressive.   \nIn fact, that kind of thinking is actively discouraged in many African societies and the results can be seen today. It is part of the reason why even a maintenance culture has taken long to take hold in many countries and in some, it never has.  \n\n\nAs for the Middle East, it is never going to happen. Sad to say. In the post-oil era, most of these countries will regress to middle income ones . The UAE is really fighting to avoid this and good luck to them and so is Bahrain but the rest, it will be a major roadblock.  \nI look at how Jordan imports Sri Lankan workers to fill its factories while it has an unemployment crisis because of attitudes towards such jobs and men actively trying to stop their wives and sisters from getting such jobs because they will become \"too independent\" and you realize things will not change in those places.",

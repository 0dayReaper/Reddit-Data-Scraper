The lowest temperature was -19.1 \u00b0C (-2 F) at Markree Castle on 16 January 1881.\n\nIt could be that the instruments of the time were not as well calibrated, and there are other [reasons](https://www.thejournal.ie/hottest-temperature-ireland-study-5960834-Jan2023/) to doubt the veracity of the 1887 measurement. The highest temperature since was 33.1 \u00b0C (91.6 F) on 18 July 2022 in Dublin.",

Christopher C. Burt, a weather historian writing for Weather Underground, believes that the 1913 Death Valley reading is \"a myth\", and is at least 2.2 or 2.8 \u00b0C (4 or 5 \u00b0F) too high.[11] Burt proposes that the highest reliably recorded temperature on Earth could still be at Death Valley, but is instead 54.0 \u00b0C (129.2 \u00b0F) recorded on 30 June 2013.",

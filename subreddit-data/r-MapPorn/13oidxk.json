From what I can tell, American chicken production is enormous, as high or higher than other major regions... but if you look at the map, most of the USA doesn't have much at all, just a few red splotches in the southeast mostly. It looks like we don't have all that many chickens.\n\nHowever, in the US, we some areas (like the Delmarva peninsula around me) that are utterly packed with factory farms that turn out unbelievable amounts of chickens. So while it looks like the USA has fewer chickens, I think its just we all have concentrated our chickens in a relatively few areas where we raise them in super-efficient ways...",

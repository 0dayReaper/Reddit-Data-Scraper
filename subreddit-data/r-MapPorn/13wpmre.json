In that sense Ahmedabad is more important than Bhopal.\n\nMoreover, the distance between Dehli and Bombay is so large that, most people who can afford to pay extra for the Vande Bharat express, will take a flight anyway. \n\nThat being said, more routes are being added regularly, so eventually there should be one.\n\nThe government is also building a bullet train between Delhi-Jaipur-Ahmedabad-Mumbai. The first stretch between Ahmedabad and Mumbai is set to open around 2026.",

There are also a lot of traders who travel from Gujarat to Mumbai for a few days of the week for work. \n\n\nSuch a demand does not exist for travel to Bhopal and Delhi is much better serviced by airlines as it is.",

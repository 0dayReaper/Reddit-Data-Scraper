See how far you get before you need to double check. Do this more and more and you\u2019re building the main skill of Topo map reading\n\nThere are two primary skills to map reading\n1) is identifying relevant landmarks\n2) Building an layout in your mind of where those landmarks are relative to you.",

Normal people navigated with maps and using mountains rivers and lakes to pinpoint where they are. Before maps you followed trails and cairns if there was not clear trail. Wards are still in use, easier to id what mountain you\u2019re looking at if there is a Cairn on one and not the other.",

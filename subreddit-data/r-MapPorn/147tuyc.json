I think it's related somewhat to whether or not the word originates from Chinese or not. For example same word in Korean would be \"ilbon*in* and often, words containing \"person\" that originate from Chinese share that same Jin/in root in the two languages. (Equivalent to \"hito\" would be I guess \"saram\" which is completely unrelated)",

E.g. \u82f1\u56fd (uk)\u3001\u4ecf\u56fd (france)\u3001\u72ec\u56fd (germany)\u3001\u7c73\u56fd (usa). You don't see these very often but \u82f1\u56fd is the form that was used on my residence card, and \u82f1\u8a9e (english) is the only major western language that uses the kanji form of the country name instead of the katakana form. You might see the other countries' initial kanji used as an abbreviation occasionally though. So like \u4ecf can be used to mean \"france\" or \"french\" in situations where we would write \"fr.\". (It also means Buddha, though, so it gets confusing)",

For example, you see 3 syllables (\u2248 Japanese \"letters\") for Russia. They are ro-shi-a. Germany has also 3 syllables: do-i-tsu. Only vowels have \"letters\" of their own, and \"n\" is the only consonant to have its own \"letter\". Every other Japanese \"letter\" represents a syllable (like \"ro\", \"shi\", \"do\", \"tsu\").\n\nSequences of consonants don't exist. Single letters (except vowels &amp; n) don't exist. Just look what happens with consonant sequences.\n\nL-u-x-e-m-b-o-u-r-g\n\nRu-ku-se-n-bu-ru-ku (the word has 7 syllables/\"letters\". An \"u\" is added to every consonant that is standing alone without being followed by a vowel, except for \"n\". Japanese consonants _must_ be followed by a vowel, except for \"n\") \n\nRemove the excess \"u's\" and you get \"Ruksenburk\" (Luxemburg). \n\nRu-k~~u~~s-e-n-b~~u~~-r~~u~~-k~~u~~\n\n\"u's\" are often not really pronounced that's why they are often used as \"filler\" vowels. But sometimes other vowels are used.\n\nG-r-e-e-c-e\n\nGi-ri-sha (3 syllables)\n\nCross out excess vowels and you get \"Grish\" (Greece)\n\nG~~i~~-ri-sh~~a~~",

Before that it was the clusterfuck that was the HRE. So no German resident of the HRE would have said 'I am from Germany', they would have said I am from Bavaria, or Prussia etc.     \n  \nAnd here is another fun fact: The famous (banned) first verse of the German national anthem \"Deutschland Deutschland \u00fcber alles\" (Germany above all) is not a song claiming German superiority above other countries. It was written in 1841 and the song was meant to urge all the local kings and princes to set aside their local power plays and unify the country as a single German nation. But as with much of German history it was later misappropriated by the Nazis and that's all what people remember.",

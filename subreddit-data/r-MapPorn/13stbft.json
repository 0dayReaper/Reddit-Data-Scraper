The Amazon River and Amazon basin itself is an easy corridor for the transportation and distribution. Also with brazils large population there are a lot of people using cocain and the numbers are rising.  \n\nDrug smuggling over seas is still done a lot and is very common. There are two options, thru ports on cargo ships. This is hard as ports are very secure and highly monitored for smuggling operations. Then there are boats that just smuggle drugs themselves, no other type of cargo. They have lots of types and names depending on where you are at, Go Fasts and LPV (low profile vessels) being the two most common general names. These boats are mostly going to America, usually thru Mexico, the two routes are Eastern Pacific or Caribbean. Right now the Eastern Pacific is the largest corridor for cocaine to America. The Caribbean is harder due to it being longer routes and more countries that have strict drug laws.",

I prefer living in multicultural societies but I do wish the mainstream media and academia would recognise this particular challenge it presents and work on solutions directly instead of lazily handwaving it away as if all problems originate from an American-centric \"white supremacy\" narrative, [as this Scientific American article does.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-diversity-create-distrust/)\n\n\n**Edit** - I shouldn't have to say this but since users on this site can be quick to make emotional judgments: Having lived in both multicultural and monocultural countries in my lifetime, I would rather put up with the cons of multicultural societies compared to the cons of monocultures. This is part of the reason why I'd like the media and academia to actually recognise and do something productive about the issue I outlined above instead of pretending it doesn't exist or diverting attention away from it.",

The big cities have large homeless/unhoused people that can be mentally unwell, sometime violent, and everyone is out of their mind from the heat. Some of the most violent and dangerous places and the smaller towns surprisingly. Not a ton of people. I'm a Yankee big city transplant, and from what I've come across most people are not situationally aware.  They don't know to avoid questionable situations, recognize danger, or how to de-escalate. \n\nI cannot emphasize how remote and rural and isolated you can be here outside of the metro areas, and how poor and uneducated the people can be. You have multigenerational families living in very small confined spaces, so you have pressure cooker domestic violence situations.\n\nYou have several military bases here with 18 year old soliders and airmen constantly flowing in. The local  criminals  prey on the na\u00efve ones (a lot of robberies gone wrong) but also there are plenty of criminals in their ranks.  When you join the military it doesn't automatically make you a wonderful human being, so if you were a POS before you signed up, that isn't magically cured.\n\nIt's also very easy to exploit people based on their faith, most folks are hyper religious. So predators try to extract a lot from them when they are just being good samaritans. There is an attitude of \"you're presenting to me as a Christian therefore you are 0 threat to me, because all Christians are good people.\" Even if you have evidence to the contrary, you're supposed to be forgiving. Despite the strong religious element, people are surprisingly non-judgmental. So I think that sets the stage for people who intervene in situations to become victims. Most murders are about money (even small amounts), drugs, or women. You're almost always murdered by someone you know. So if you avoid those situations, you'll be fine 99% of the time. I've been all over this state, and I've never had a concern as a female traveling alone. I mind my business and don't bother anybody, and people don't drag me into their bullshit.",

That's similar to every Eastern European country (excluding Russia and Turkiye) combined.\n\nYeah Brazil and Mexico are slightly smaller than the US, but their states' are also comparable in population to European countries. Roraima, the smallest state in Brazil, has the population of Kosovo. Meanwhile, Sao Paulo, the biggest one, is comparable to Spain. Chiapas or Baja California in Mexico are comparable to Serbia.\n\nIt makes complete sense to not subdivide Europe into regions because of sheer population size. Europe compares to the others as a whole, especially after removing Russia out of the continent. Best bet would be subdivinding Europe into NUTS-1 regions, but those are very unknown, and still comparatively small.",

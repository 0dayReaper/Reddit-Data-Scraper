With each major continent separated by only a narrow strait, there wouldn't really be a need for someone like Columbus to bridge the gap between an Old World and a New World.\n\nBy the way, I'm guessing you must be Korean, right? I can tell by the names: \ucc3d\uc6d0, \ubc31\ub0a8, \ubd81\uc740, \uad50\ucc3d, \uc11c\uc900, \ub300\uc900, and \ub09c\uc6d0.",

Hope you guys enjoy! \r  \n\r  \nA Superearth orbiting around a red dwarf , Maewha/Shin-Busan\\* orbits Gwanghwa at approximately 8 lightyears away from Sol , tracing an impossible orbit around it\u2019s blighted star. It\u2019s mere existence should be impossible , for despite being within tidal locking radius , it is not tidally locked , with a synodic day of 22.188h(earth hours) . Furthermore , it is not alone , with a secondary mars sized companion , Se-oh , a moon covered in impossibly deep oceans filled with aqueous Sulphuric acid , hosting an exotic biosphere in its own right. Both should not exist , and this is one of the great mysteries of the system .\r  \n\r  \nFor 2 binary planets to come so close to their star, and not be tidally locked ? It ought to be impossible. Maehwa/Shin-Busan does however offer some clues to it\u2019s origin , for it is devoid of fossil fuels , much to the dismay of many prospectors. All this points towards outside intervention in the system\u2019s past , and this has become source for many wild conspiracies. Scientists are still unsure of the outside intervention hypothesis however , and many other proposals have been suggested to explain the system\u2019s anomalies.",

A lot of fantasy maps have highly unlikely mountain ranges and other major features that are not explained through some magical stuff but also not plausible on a typical earth-like planet.\n\nYour seems to avoid the issue.\n\nIt could use a few more small islands similar to our pacific islands and all those island chains off some coasts, but those also could be explained away with the zoom level not showing them at this height.",

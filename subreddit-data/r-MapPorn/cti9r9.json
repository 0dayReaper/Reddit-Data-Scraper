Bolsonaro has gutted the Ministry of the Environment, defunded IBAMA, the environmental fiscalisation agency, and removed Army escort for environmental agents, which was necessary to not get murdered. Fires in the last few years have been at a low point due to an enforcement infrastructure painstakingly built over a decade, and Bolsonaro tore that down in a few months. The fear is precisely that 2003 and 2005 become the new normal.",

Bolsonaro promised that until the end of his tenure he will have all Native Brazilians living in Amazon exterminated and that he will destroy the whole forest to give the land to rich landowners that supported his campaign so they can use the grassland that HE thinks the forest will become to raise cattle. He fired the head of Brazilian satellite agency because the satellite was showing those fires. Two days ago the smoke and ashes from those massive fires covered Sao Paulo MORE THAN THOUSAND MILES TO THE SOUTH AND TURNED THE DAY AT 3PM INTO NIGHT. Ashes were raining over the city like snow.

There is also a campaign by Germany and Norway to have Brazil expelled from all councils and commissions it is a member in United Nations if Bolsonaro does not stop his crusade to destroy Amazon forest. Since he took the oath as president the deforested area in Amazon increased 381% (in only 6 months), and fires jumped from 7,500 for THE WHOLE LAST YEAR to 72,000 LAST MONTH ONLY. He has been called in Germany \"Der depp von Ipanema\" The Idiot from Ipanema and has been compared to Adolph Hitler by German Media. He said that the fires ARE NOT HAPPENING and that it is all a conspiracy by Norwegian and Germans that are \"jealous\" of Brazilians, because Brazilians are so rich and people in Norway are poor and miserable. He is a madman supported by only a few people even in Brazil (around 25% according to the last polls over there), people with serious mental and sexual issues.",

You don't need to do that: Bolsonaro actions and speeches are bad by themselves...\n\n&gt;Large landowners, loggers and paramilitary deathsquads funded by illegal miners connected to Brazilian president Bolosonaro. \n\nIt seems exaggerated. I haven't see anything about paramilitary deathsquads and illegal miners setting fires. Instead, it were land grabbers and farmers that felt supported by Bolsonaro words.\n\n&gt;Bolsonaro promised that until the end of his tenure he will have all Native Brazilians living in Amazon exterminated \n\nFortunately, he did not promise that. However, he praised the north-american cavalry for exterminating natives in the past; he criticizes natives all the time; and he didn't care when a native leader was murdered. So, his action are going towards this, even though he didn't promise it.\n\n&gt;and that he will destroy the whole forest to give the land to rich landowners that supported his campaign so they can use the grassland that HE thinks the forest will become to raise cattle. \n\nAgain, no explicit promise. \n\n&gt; He fired the head of Brazilian satellite agency because the satellite was showing those fires.  \n\n\\* The satellites were showing the deforestation.\n\n&gt; More than a thousand Native Brazilians living on reservations were murdered by paramilitary militias organized and funded by Bolsonaro and his supporters, to open the way for illegal logging and gold mining.  \n\nAny source? The only murdered native that I heard of was the leader of the wai\u00e3pi. All the other news about native murdering were from previous years.\n\nThe paramilitary militias that he is associated with are in the southeast region of the country, and very unlikely to be murdering natives in the amazon rainforest. They are most likely murdering thousands of poor people in favelas.\n\n&gt; Germany, Sweden, Norway and France are already imposing UNILATERAL ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AGAINST BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT, COMPANIES AND INDIVIDUALS because of those TERRORIST activities funded and organized by Bolsonaro and his supporters. There is also a campaign by Germany and Norway to have Brazil expelled from all councils and commissions it is a member in United Nations if Bolsonaro does not stop his crusade to destroy Amazon forest.  \n\nAre they though? At this point, I think this would be the only thing that would open the eyes of Bolsonaro supporters, but I haven't see anything about it. The closest thing to it are people in these countries demanding the sanctions, but nothing close to an official position.\n\nThe only \"sanction\" so far is that they stopped contributing to the Amazon Funding since Bolsonaro wanted to use the funding to reimburse landowners instead of spending in the forest protection. But before the \"sanction\", Bolsonaro said that he would not want the funding if he could not chose how to use it. So, it is not something that affects his supporters.\n\n&gt; He said that the fires ARE NOT HAPPENING and that it is all a conspiracy by Norwegian and Germans that are \"jealous\" of Brazilians, because Brazilians are so rich and people in Norway are poor and miserable.\n\nIt looks very false to me. IMO, he did worse: he said that the fires were caused by NGOs that lost their funding and are trying to give a bad image to him. He (or his minister, I don't remember) also said that European countries already destroyed their forests for development and now it is our time to develop, so they cannot tell what we should do with the forest.",

This isn\u2019t billionaire cattle ranchers in the north... because they\u2019re not there. Especially since how agricultural laws in Brazil work, for the big agricultural players, the banks and tradings that buy their products must know where they originate from: what farms the products come from, and they check by sat\u00e9lite and in loco visits the environmental situation, as they are legally liable for any environmental issues that arise from the farms they buy their products from. These issues overwhelmingly happen with smaller farmers- some large farmers do it too- but they are minorities, as otherwise their lives get extremely more dificult (lose access to the financial system and many of the more traditional trade partners). There is a difference between legal deforestation, which involves getting permission from the environmental authorities, and complying with the environmental code, and keeping the minimum forest reserve, with doing it illegally like it is being done in these images.",

People need to make a living and it\u2019s easy for us, who all likely have decent jobs or some sort of access to capital, to tell others they shouldn\u2019t take advantage of their natural resources. At the end of the day, the problem goes beyond our individual choices and decisions. Unless we change the fundamental nature of our economy from one that relies on constant growth and consumption to a resource-based one, problems like this will continue for eternity. Do I eagerly advocate for such a society? No, because i enjoy my lifestyle just as much as the next guy. But our only hope for fixing the problem within our current economic framework is waiting for the next revolution in organic chemistry or something, where we could take products like a PS4 for instance, and instead of throwing it out, we could potentially melt it down and make something else with the same material. But we\u2019re a loooong way out from that and we\u2019re running out of time.",

            "comment": "Hello, everybody. hope all is good with you.\n\nHere in Brazil, not all is good, as you can see by the picture. to tell the truth, as I write this comment, it may be worse, unfortunately.\n\nI see a lot of pictures in other subs - all you can is look after them. It looks like Reddit is doing a great job on last days, people really cares about what is happening right now in the forest in Brazil... but in fact, the fires is not only happening in the forest, but also in other places, like the Cerrado. And, truth to be told, it happens because it is winter down here, which means it is really dry and hot. If we could make a comparison, it would be like fires in California: it happens every year.\n\nBut, of course, something is different this season. A lot different. If you stop by in r/pics you can see some examples on whats going on, for example.here,[https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/ctncmh/dear\\_brazilians\\_try\\_everything\\_to\\_stop\\_bolsonaro/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/ctncmh/dear_brazilians_try_everything_to_stop_bolsonaro/) you can see one of reasons of why forest is being burned. The fact it is being happening for a long time, if you ask me, but the recent elected President has an agenda which empower farmers to set fire, not only on their properties ([https://twitter.com/euchsouza/status/1163607266328809473?s=12](https://twitter.com/euchsouza/status/1163607266328809473?s=12)), which may get out of control, everywhere.\n\nThe ashes from this are so much, the wind brought them to the biggest city in Brazil, a few days ago. Most are not familiar with the patterns of winds from them Amazon and the cold from the South, and how the weather is in this part of the Globe is, but the important message is - please take a look at the color of the water on this video (around 30 seconds):  [https://g1.globo.com/sp/sao-paulo/noticia/2019/08/20/analises-confirmam-presenca-de-particulas-de-queimadas-maior-do-que-o-normal-em-agua-de-chuva-preta-de-sp.ghtml](https://g1.globo.com/sp/sao-paulo/noticia/2019/08/20/analises-confirmam-presenca-de-particulas-de-queimadas-maior-do-que-o-normal-em-agua-de-chuva-preta-de-sp.ghtml)\n\nSafe to say, it is going to affect other countries, if it continues. Temperature will rise within years, to say the least.\n\nGlobally.\n\nI also read, \"what can I do\"? Well, as in any Democratic Country, I believe, you can reach your Representative, either in Congress or Parliament.\n\nIt is also true, once again, most of the Amazon is in Brazil - but not entirely. Part of it is in other countries in South America, and if other fellow South Americans are reading this, it deeply concerns you: what is happening in Brazil, right now, might endanger you, your family, and your country. You should also take action, now: spread the word, let your Government and the Media know what the situation is. If your country depends on the water from the Amazon river or any of its streams, it is time to move on, Hermano.\n\nSo, as you all can see, it is not just a Brazilian problem.\n\n**It is a Global problem, happening, right now, in Brazil.**\n\nAnd, all of us, have to do something, locally.\n\n**NOW.**\n\nSo, please, spread this message.\n\nThanks.",

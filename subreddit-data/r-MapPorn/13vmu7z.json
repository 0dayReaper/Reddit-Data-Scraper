Found this while sorting through a storage closet at my school in Central Province (roughly the middle of the Lala region on the map). Seems to have been given to the school by the Zambian government as a teaching aid, but I don't think it's been used in years. For reference, my village speaks mostly Lala and Bemba, with a bit of Nyanja once in a while.",

The word originally meant the meal enjoyed after having worked for a bit. This used to be around 8-9 in the morning, because there were no TVs or computers that kept people up late I guess. Over time the work hours changed and with that when people had their frukost. 8-9 became more like 11-12. \n\nFor whatever reason Sweden and Norway reverted back the time frukost/frokost was had to early morning but at the same time changed the definition to be the first meal of the day.\n\nAs an aside: Another word that was affected by the industrial revolution was the word for dinner, middag. It used to refer to the main meal of the day: Which was usually had in the middle of the day, hence the name, after the bulk of the work had been done. Over time that changed to its current time, the evening. In Danish the timeslot for middag was replaced with frokost, and in Swedish/Norwegian it was replaced with lunch/lunsj respectively.",

Dinner is aftensmad or evening meal.\n\nMiddag have three meanings: Either literally midday/noon, a hot meal at lunch or evening and finally a bigger dinner in the evening.",

We had to pick them one by one.\n\nBTW, our roof in Brazil are mostly made of corrugated Asbestos cement sheets. They are cheap but break off really easy and are basically large sails when there\u2019s any strong wind. (I just discovered now that they are made out of asbestos, FUN)\n\nSeveral large eucalyptus trees (10m to 15m high) fell off nearby (with roots and all), the kiosk roof of a small petrol station nearby fell off too. Some small gymnasiums made out of brick also collapsed.\n\nPetrol station (at 2:11): https://youtu.be/7D6Evo4q9yw?t=131  \nEucalyptus trees (at 8:59): https://youtu.be/7D6Evo4q9yw?t=459   \n\nIt was chaos and lots of people tried to earn money with the situation by stealing aluminum TV antenna dishes (like our house had) and gates because it was scattered all around. Also the roof local market was wild because there wasn\u2019t really enough for everyone.",

S\u00f3 cyclones don\u2019t have the fuel to sustain themselves and the atmosphere conditions aren\u2019t conducive to their formation. What happened in Santa Catarina was an extraordinary fluke. \n\nThe South Atlantic along the Brazilian coast is incredibly stable - especially compared to the Caribbean and East Coast of the North America.\n\nI can speak from experience too. I grew up near the coast in Mid-Atlantic of the US and we had some kind of tropical depression or hurricane at least once a year. I\u2019ve lived in Rio for ten years and haven\u2019t so much as seen a storm come in from over the ocean - the the rains come from inland. \n\nAlso - knock on wood.",

I will try to succinctly clarify u/theFuzz1's correct but short comment. Source: I am a meteorologist, coincidentally just finished a graduate level course in tropical meteorology.\n\nThe Coriolis force is proportional to the sin of latitude as well as the velocity of the wind. In the northern hemisphere, it causes a deflection to the right, in the southern hemisphere, it causes a deflection to the left. At the equator, where latitude is 0\u00b0, the Coriolis force is zero. It is weak enough near the equator (+/-5\u00b0) that tropical cyclones have a tough time forming; circulation around a low pressure center is caused by geostrophic flow, wind that is balanced between the pressure gradient force and the Coriolis force. When the Coriolis force is too weak, the pressure gradient force can dominate, with wind blowing from high to low pressure filling the area of low pressure.\n\nA tropical cyclone that formed away from the equator COULD move near or even cross the equator and hold together for a short time based only on the inertia of the wind and the continued pressure gradient force, but friction would slow the winds and if it did manage to cross the equator, the Coriolis force reversing (even if weak) would work against the circulation. This would lead to the low pressure center rapidly filling, dissipating the storm (\"rapidly\" in this case meaning on the scale of 24 hours).\n\nIt is unlikely that a tropical cyclone WOULD approach the equator. Tropical cyclones move mostly due to the prevailing winds. In the tropics, these winds blow from east to west, but near the equator they die off, becoming nearly calm (doldrums). The other thing that moves tropical cyclones is the beta effect or beta drift. This is a slow drift (1-2 m/s) to the west and poleward (north in the northern hemisphere, south in the southern hemisphere). This is caused by changes in the potential vorticity field due to the circulation and slight differences in Coriolis force between the southern and northern extent of the storm, but unfortunately requires a good grasp on atmospheric dynamics to fully understand.\nhttps://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Beta_drift#:~:text=Beta%20drift%20generally%20causes%20tropical,American%20Meteorological%20Society%20(AMS).\n\nTL;DR: a tropical cyclone COULD approach and cross the equator, but it would be weakening the whole time. It is UNLIKELY it ever would approach and cross the equator due to beta drift dominating in the equatorial doldrums and pushing it poleward.",

The spin is because of the winds converging on a low pressure zone and \u201cmissing\u201d the center because of the Earth\u2019s different speed at latitudes. \n\nI don\u2019t know enough about why a low pressure zone *can\u2019t* cross the equator though, but I know the doldrums exist at the equator, which are notoriously slow winds. Slow wind equals high pressure which would push the systems away. Not sure why they exist at the equator.\n\nEdit: Credit to u/funknjam [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/12b8o79/no_hurricane_has_ever_crossed_the_equator/jewh1cv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=1&amp;context=3) for a better explanation. Basically for the second part I\u2019m wrong that the equator has higher pressure. Faster wind may mean lower pressure but it\u2019s the gradient that creates wind. The equator is relatively low pressure in reality because of rising hot damp air. I\u2019m looking to get more info but I believe it\u2019s because of convention currents in the upper atmosphere that push hurricanes (low pressure systems) away from the equator.",

Or the pressure is almost always higher there because all the air around the low pressure system is pushed by all the air south (or north) of it towards the equator at a lower altitude, as it approaches the Equator it naturally heats up more and rises especially over the ocean or desert which makes a wall of \u201cmore powerful\u201d low* pressure air. It\u2019s part of the cells north and south of the equator though I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more complicated processes alongside that.\n\nIdk that there\u2019s a cleaner answer than Earth is a spinning tilted sphere with air that the sun hits. It\u2019s just a feature of the size, topology, and nature of the Atmosphere-Earth-Sun system and unless the surface of the Earth was massively different some version of this is just how it shakes out.",

Coriolis also causes \u03b2-drift that moves hurricanes away from equator.  But Coriolis force is small compared to the forces that sustains the spin once it's formed.   \n\nThe reason why hurricanes don't cross the equator is that there are no  lack large-scale patterns like a cold fronts that could push them across (in addition to  \u03b2-drift). If that would happen for some reason, the direction of spin would not change at the equator. The surrounding wind patterns would probably break it down as it would move to the other side.",

Hurricanes are for ones above the Atlantic Ocean or Pacific Ocean to the east of the IDL.\n\nTyphoons have names sent in by 14 countries and territories;\n\nCambodia, China, North Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, Laos, Macau, Malaysia, FS Micronesia, Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, United States, and Vietnam,\n\n5 sets of 2 names for each country which they use to rotate through. While other tropical cyclones are named after people, typhoons are named after animals, flowers, astrological signs, and a few personal names.\n\nIf a hurricane crosses the International Date Line into the Western Pacific, the hurricane retains its name but will become a typhoon instead.\n\nAll this happens normally, but if a tropical cyclone enters the area that the Philippines (PAGASA) monitors, they have their own list of names that they will designate the tropical cyclone with, with their initials rotating from A to Z like OP said.",

Because of cold currents we have cold water, which doesn\u2019t evaporate so well as warm water. Hence the air above isn't warmed (and moisturised) by the sea so much. Smaller temperature gradients means smaller pressure differences means less wind. Less wind in general means smaller statistical chance of storms, which is buttressed by the lack of moist air. Water in rapidly rising air gets electrical charge which becomes self-reinforcing at some threshold.",

It was closed for a month. Next morning there was a lot of damage to roofs, trees and even railroads. \nThey had warnings for typhoons, floodings, earth quakes and landslides.\n\nSo yeah, damage does happen, but you probably wont hear about 1 subway line out of 5 being crippled on the US news, or any news outside of Japan. Frankly I hear no news about the US hurricanes either, just a \"there is a big hurricane\", then no news.",

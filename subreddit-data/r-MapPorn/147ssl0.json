Under a united federation, rebel groups would be in direct conflict with the Ugandan, Kenyan, and Tanzanian militaries. Currently, the DRC\u2019s military has no capability to fight the rebel groups. Once the rebels (mostly political, not ethnoreligious) are eradicated, the trillions of dollars worth of resources will really accelerate EAF\u2019s developmental trajectory.",

In 2018, an intergovernmental committee was formed to begin drafting a constitution for this potential federation. If it were to form, the federation would become the largest and most populous country in Africa (and the 7th largest and 4th most populous in the world). It would also be the second country to have coasts on both the Atlantic and Indian Oceans (assuming the DRC would be included).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Union of Sahel States (a name of convenience which I don't believe has been stated by the proponents themselves) is a much more recent and tentative [proposal to unify Burkina Faso, Guinea, and Mali into a federation](https://www.africanews.com/2023/02/09/burkina-guinea-mali-a-new-axis-on-the-continent/). If it were to unify, it would overtake South Africa as the 6th most populous country in Africa, and would be the 4th largest by area (overtaking Libya).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI colored the countries with colors that appear on their flags (though not necessarily the most prominent ones \u2013 they had to be different from their neighbors obviously). While the proposed Union of Sahel States doesn't have a flag, all three constituent countries have red in their flag, and I imagine it would be present on the flag of their union. As for the EAF, I used the [flag of the East African Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_East_African_Community) as a provisional national flag, as is often done online.",

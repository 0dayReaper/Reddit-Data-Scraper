But at the same time, we could also say that, for example, less victimization of violence causes poverty to reduce. These factors are interlinked in many, many ways. All of these things you mentioned could form some of those 3 million maps I mentioned before. It's even possible the other way around is impacting this, if people live longer they gain more wealth for reasons such as investment and generational wealth.\n\nThe graph you presented also shows correlation technically, not causation. Truly proving causation to statistical rigor for a trend like this is basically impossible. The only real way to determine causation definitively is a controlled experiment, but you can't exactly do a controlled experiment on this sort of thing.\n\nMost social scientists would accept this as convincing data for causation. Most statisticians would not. Correlation is clear, but exactly what mechanism is at play isn't technically proven.\n\ntl;dr: we *can* say that \"if you are more wealthy, your life expectancy is likely longer.\" we *probably, but not necessarily,* can say that \"becoming more wealthy will cause your life expectancy to increase.\" Correlation doesn't equal causation, even if it can look pretty convincingly like causal evidence.\n\nTo be clear I'm not against the idea that wealth causes greater life expectancy. I'm just arguing for statistical rigor.",

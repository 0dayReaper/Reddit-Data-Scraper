It would still have been the Principality of Wales in 1500, and while those lands still would have been overseen by the king or Prince of Wales, it was still technically legally separate from England until the laws were past over a number of years. [This is the most detailed map I\u2019ve seen displaying the Welsh Marches and the actual principality, though the map shows it from the 14th Century.](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wales_14C_Map.png)",

The duchy of Vasconia was a big territory in which your so called Euskal Herria was just a part of it. And true, Basque was spoken (in some territories) but it was neither the language of the noblemen (who talked in latin) or most of the population, who talked Gascon. \n\nHence, saying that the duchy of Vasconia was a basque state is like saying that nowadays Spain is a catalan State",

They obviously mostly don't support independence for the Basque Country, because they are part of the bigger nations, for whom the Basque Country is just a part of Spain and France. But, on the other hand, the Basques consider the Basque Country as their beloved homeland. These two separate groups interpret history as they want. You didn't mention your ethnicity, but from what I see, you could be not Basque, but rather part of another nation for which this Country is just a part Spain and France.\n\nBasques might not have had an independent nation state, but many other nations didn't have their own either, but in recent times became fully independent and their states became recognized by practically the whole planet (such as the Latvians or the Belarussians).",

Basques inhabited a big portion of the teritory around the Western Pyrenees since millenia, but then their lands were brought upon foreign nations' rule. These foreign nations (not as foreign nowadays) assimilated much of the Basque land by often cruel and unfair means. And now Basques cling on the comparatively tiny area of Gipuzkoa, Bizkaia, Northern Nafarroa, Northern Araba and minor parts across the border in France, trying to save their language, customs, traditions from disappearance. It is easy undermining small nations while being part of a bigger, stronger and more fortunate nation.\n\nNo one is talking about any invasion, you are exaggerating at this point. Any person would like to achieve this by peaceful means.",

My intent was to make a more decent map of the Basque Country region (there is a page on Wikipedia), since there aren't many of them IMO, and to bring awareness to this incredibly unique and beautiful region. You may think one way or another, but let's appreciate this map nonetheless. If there are any mistakes, feel free to point them out :)",

This agency did not perform actual management functions.  \nAt the same time as the famous Zheng He fleet, there existed a fleet that toured Manchuria.  \nThe voyages of this fleet, the construction of shipyards in Manchuria, and the hundreds of military positions in Manchuria were not managed by the Nurgan Regional Military Commission, but were directly under the command of Liaodong/Beijing.  \nTherefore, after Zheng He's fleet was stopped, this agency was also abolished.",

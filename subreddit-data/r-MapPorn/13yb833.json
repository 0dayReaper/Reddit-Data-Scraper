    "postText": "Iraq and Syria. ISIS is not defeated, and it will continue to plan attacks against Western targets while setting conditions for a resurgence in Iraq and Syria. The US Central Command (CENTCOM) commander highlighted the continued threat of ISIS efforts to break out prisoners from detention facilities in northeast Syria and sympathizers from internally displaced persons (IDP) camps. A US withdrawal\u2014as suggested by a recent congressional resolution\u2014would inadvertently improve ISIS\u2019s fortunes in Iraq and Syria, where it would focus on freeing veteran cadres and building support in rural areas. A US withdrawal would likely force the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to deprioritize anti-ISIS efforts to counter Syrian regime and Turkish incursions into SDF-controlled areas.",

Like not even as a slur, but it's run by the Kagans, who were very prominent in the actual neoconservative movement, and were very prominent in pushing for regime change and outright invasion in Iraq.\n\nThe ISW got a lot of mainstream acceptance with their coverage of the war in Ukraine, but I guess I'd say take maps like this with a boulder-sized grain of salt, because it's very much their worldview and pushing their politics to show maps of jihadist insurgencies ESCALATING basically everywhere in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia. I'd want to see some actual data and statistics behind these maps - I've read similar reports of theirs from years past and often the data isn't, uh, as solid as they portray it.",

It's filling in entire countries as if they were engulfed by jihadist insurgencies. \n\nLike it shows DR Congo as having an ESCALATING (sorry, I just get amused at them using all caps) jihadist insurgency. It doesn't note that the insurgency is limited to a [few parts](https://newlinesinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/NLISAP-Africa-ACLED-05212020.png) of North Kivu and Ituri Provinces along the Ugandan border. Nor does it note that the ISIS-related jihadists are just one of a [number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kivu_conflict#/media/File:Kivuconflict.png) of insurgent groups in the area. They've killed hundreds and abducted more (but I'm note sure how ISW is calculating what against what to determine it's escalating right now), but it's not even the most powerful or dangerous insurgent group in the area, which seems to be Rwanda-backed M23. \n\nSo no, I'd say that these sorts of maps they put out don't actually show any underlying evidence for their claims, and tend to go maximalist for scare-effect for their intended audience of US policy makers. They're not necessarily wrong but they are intentionally misleading.",

They do note that terrorism has increased significantly in the Sahel in the past 15 years. But they also note that global terrorism deaths in 2022 were nine percent lower than the year before, and 38 percent lower than at a global high in 2015. The Middle East - North Africa region saw 791 terrorist-related deaths in 2022 - the lowest since 2013. South Asia was still the worst-affected region, but had a 31 percent decline since the previous year, and excluding Afghanistan's stats the other countries saw a 71 percent decline. \n\nWhich is to say - it's a complicated and shifting picture, and I'd be very very very careful with the Kagans claiming that jihadists are basically on the march and expanding literally everywhere. They've been doing this same shtick for over twenty years.",

The Castilians, French, and Italians all still speak highly-derived and divergent forms of Vulgar Latin, that now happen to have different names.\n\nJust as we still speak English, as they did in 900 CE in England; just a significantly-changed version. \n\nThere's no point where a language \"stops being\" itself; that's not how phylogeny works.\n\nJust like in biology: humans are still fundamentally lobe-finned fish.\n\nBy any phylogenetic definition, the Romance languages *are still forms of Latin* (and Proto-Italic, and Proto-Indo-European). There's no fundamental difference between \"being a descendant of\" and \"being a form of\" in this context.",

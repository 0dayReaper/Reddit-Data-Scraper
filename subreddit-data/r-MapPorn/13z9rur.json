North America falls down towards the south, the water could flow off, except for the great lakes, which have a similar history to europe.\n\nOver here the tarrain goes up towards the south, so all the meltwater was stuck against the ice and moved alongside it, creating dozens of miles wide valleys in a southeast-northwest direction. We don't have huge lakes from ice scraping at the bottom, but wide fields if tiny lakes and a whole inland sea.\n\nOh, an Scandinavia is sill lifting upwards.",

Today we're just under 530K, and that's with considerable growth over the past few years (basically since the pandemic began).\n\nUntil around 2005, we really did not care about immigration. But since then, our government has been pushing it hard [nlimmigration.ca](https://nlimmigration.ca) and we've gone from a few dozen newcomers per year to upwards of 2,500+. It's always been diverse and worldly here - I mean, it's a port city, and was one of the largest and most important European cities in North America until around 1900 - there are Arabic and Mandarin tombstones here from the 1800s, on and on. But it's much better now. The Nigerian, Filipino, Ukrainian, Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi, ex-YU, and Spanish/Portuguese communites are especially visible. Fingers crossed the momentum keeps going. It's existentially important for us to grow before our demographic collapse finishes us off lol",

Typically most of the population gains from increased birthrates in first nation communities are offset by members of said communities leaving once they come of age, although with Nunavut being so isolated it makes sense as to why many stay.\n\nI just didn't realize percentage wise how much the population has increased.  Really though, that 2.5% increase is only from about 900 people being born between 2016-2021 according to stats can.\n\nhttps://www.nunavutnews.com/news/nunavut-sees-its-population-grow-by-over-two-percent/",

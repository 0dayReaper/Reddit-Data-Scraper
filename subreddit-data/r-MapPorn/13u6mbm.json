The Postmaster General sent out notices to all of us residents, reminding us to put in \u2018change of address\u2019 cards showing our new locations if we needed to evacuate.  (Vaporization of post offices evidently wasn\u2019t part of his contingency plan.) Then the Washington Post showed a map of evacuation routes. The routes were laughable \u2026 main commuter routes that are bumper to bumper on normal work days. (On 9/11, those same routes were parking lots; trains stopped running as staff abandoned their posts; cell phone networks collapsed, and landlines were useless.) yeah, there\u2019s no such thing as an \u2018orderly evacuation,\u2019 or a\u2019winnable\u2019 nuclear confrontation.",

Also air vs ground burst changes things. Ground burst will kick up a bunch of fallout whereas air burst will allow the concussion waves to focus and bounce off the ground for greater effect.  \n\nSorry I will stop being so picky",

With GPS and other targeting technology, the bombs can be much smaller to do \"surgical strikes\" and take out a specific target. The big 20 megaton bombs were developed because aiming was imprecise ; a miss of several miles wouldn't compromise the mission.",

That was the reason that post WW II they built lots of Nike air defense missile sites. \n\nEven so, I am a fan of many post-atomic war science fiction and comics and graphic novels.",

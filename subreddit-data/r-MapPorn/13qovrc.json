It's logical.\n\nMost of the land in every country belongs not to private individuals but to the state. In order for a certain group to have a claim to the land they must have an independent political entity that will rule in the territory at some point. the Palestinians never had such an entity and therefore they have no claim to the land and certainly Israel could not occupie it from them. Israel of course occupied it from the Jordanians who inherited it from the British who took it from the Ottomans that occupied it from the arabs and so on and so forth. The last independent entity that ruled the territory was....... the Kingdom of Judah. if anything, \"Palestine\" was liberated by Israel.",

British was just the new kid in the block. I mean even today, you likely pay taxes which doesn't benefit you in anyway, only enrich an aristocracy. \n\nWhat was really different at the time was that palestinians had freedom, in the sense that they could live whatever they wanted, travel whatever they wanted, inside its place, could plant olives, oranges, herd, make a living, and have rights. \n\nToday is different, since Israel is a foreign land in regard to palestinians, they are excluded from most of their past territory.",

The point is people love to make false and offensive comparisons between Zionism and Nazism, often by disparaging Jewish claims to the land as the same as Nazi blood and soil ideology. I have never heard the Palestinians accused of the same when they employ similar talking points or imagery (not that they should, I'm just pointing out the the double standard).",

I also know about Kfar Qasim massacre  in 1956 but it was initiated by some sadistic commander and they were all sentenced to prison.\nI think I saw a statistic in which it showed that the total number of people killed in the Israeli-palestinian conflict which is 30k. If you exclude militias from both sides so you get civilians I think it is in the low hundreds, which is low for a conflict that is ongoing for 94 years.\nI agree with you that there are many horrible things and that war is shit, but overall, even if you don't agree with the right of Israel to exist, I think it should be acknowledged that if Israel stops fighting it will cease to exist and if the terrorist organizations stop fighting there will be peace.",

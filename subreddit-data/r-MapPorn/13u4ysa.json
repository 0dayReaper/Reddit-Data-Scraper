But for the CIA to be the GDP proportionate equivalent of Quds for the US they\u2019d need a $200 billion dollar budget, at least half of which would be spent on terrorists, warlords, etc. They send hezbollah the proportionate equivalent of $45 billion dollars every year and hamas $7.7 billion. There are many other groups they fund in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen.\n\nOf course it\u2019s hard to estimate IRGC spending as they have a significant amount of illegal and non-state revenue sources they\u2019re hiding. But these numbers are much higher than what the US spends on comparable things. The vast majority of the US intelligence budget isn\u2019t transfers to nonstate forces.",

                    "comment": "Before you go, you should now that in Iran some companies only have one day weekends or 1 and half day weekends. Iran until a decade ago only had 1 day weekends on Fridays, so in order to compensate, a lot of holidays were added to the calendar and cmpanies were generous with giving days off(for instance, there was a thing called \"beynol-tatilayn,\" which was a casual off day between 2 off days). Eventually, two day weekends were introduced, but it wasn't really enforced, so a lot of countries continued with 6 day per week work weeks.\n\nEven schools resisted 2 days weekends for years. In my school we still had 6-day school weeks and our last day we had to stay until night! 2 days weekends were finally enforced on my last year in high school.\n\nFun but unrelated fact: We Iranians resisted the concept of weeks and weekends for almost a thousand years despite knowing about it because the number 7 was considered an unlucky in our culture. So, instead, we implemented monthly angelic celebrations that lasted for several days consecutively, which is why our culture is very familiar with the idea of having lots of holidays.",

They were considered evil because they didn't follow the standard movement of other stars in the night sky. So they were seen as chaotic.\n\nThey are even named after evil champions of infernal from Avestan mythology. In Mithraisim, the names of weeks are named after planets, but it's important to note that this was the case only with Western Mithraism, which was primarily influenced by Greek and Roman mythology as evident by the fact that they named days of the weeks after planets like Romans. \n\nAs for the 7 great houses, well, that wasn't really by design. And 7 sin table as we know it became popular long after the decline of Zoroastrianisim. \n\nMost of my knowledge of ancient Iran is from the books by Hashem Razi. I did Google info on the number 7, but most of the articles focused on the post-islam view of Iranians on number 7.\n\nEdit: Obviously, Mithraists modified the names of the week slightly to reflect their own views, such as adding Mithra and Tir to the names of days of the week even though they are not names of planets. (There is also a Star called Tir, which is unrelated to the planet Tir, the Yaztas in Iranian mythology is assosiated with the star)",

But yeah also even more traditionally than that, I agree that there are some bad associations with the number 7, but I think most are good. What about the Amesha Spenta, who are the 7 emanations and who the first 7 days of the Zoroastrian calendar are named after? And the 7 kesvar in the Avesta? Even each of the books of the Avesta is divided into 7 volumes. Similarly, each of the three lines of the Ahuna Vairya prayer has seven words.",

Merchants and ship owners from other, more exposed cities moved to it. \n\nBefore the 80 year war with Spain trade was centered on the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt river deltas (like nowadays with Rotterdam and Antwerp), which of course makes much more sense if defense is not your first priority. Amsterdam of 1544 was a less important place trading only with the Baltic Sea coasts.",

The day that Louis Bonaparte (Napoleon's younger brother) got the keys of the city and became the king of the Netherlands.\n\nAlthough I believe Amsterdam's grow started earlier when people from Antwerp moved to Amsterdam, because of the war with Spain.",

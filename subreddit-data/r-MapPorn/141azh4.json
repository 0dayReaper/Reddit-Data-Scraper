            "comment": "Kinda: this is Buenos Aires *province*, with the large glowing blob the city itself (Capital Federal).  Most of the land is flat and was used for cattle ranching, so settlements rose up around the stations as the railway spread from the capital with its ports, into the interior.\n\nThe historic core of the city was on a grid from the 1580's, with land allocated to expedition members by Juan de Garay.  Likely the grid layout just was an equitable method of distributing the land, rather than a planned city like Florence, Paris and London. (edit - I mean the extensive plans for London after the Great Fire, which were largely abandoned because people just moved back and rebuilt, and a lack of funding for a Grand Project).   The subsequent development of the city still follows a grid layout to an extent, but there are odd segments where areas have been developed later on, not a strict extension of the original layout. \n\nhttps://www.econparaphernalia.com/post/history-of-buenos-aires-diversity\n\nAvenida 9 de Julio seems to be the only major area that was planned (until modern reclamations and redevelopments of the Dock area) but that was also much later.\n\nI'm interested if there are any other histories or maps of BA's development over the centuries?\n\nEdit: great article [here](https://www.archdaily.cl/cl/801267/mapas-planes-y-esquemas-en-la-construccion-del-gran-buenos-aires-por-novick-favelukes-y-vecslir), a summary of a longer piece [(en Castellano)] (http://www.iaa.fadu.uba.ar/ojs/index.php/anales/article/view/162/148) which I will be sifting through tonight. Thanks for throwing me down this rabbit hole!",

In some of these stations also the production of the surrounding area could be loaded into trains. Some of these first stations, grew to be towns or cities. \n\nThe cities layout is the result of the needs of the railway",

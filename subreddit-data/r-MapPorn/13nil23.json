It only stops fitting when it creeps under the umbrella of sovereignty.\n\nSo for example the early skirmishes that occurred in the very beginnings of the American Civil War involved radicals.  The process of coalescing of the Confederate States of America changed that so that the Battle of Fort Sumter was between states.\n\nYes, there were state-supported ethnic Russian radicals operating independently in the Donbass.  But now they are under the sovereign umbrella and radicalism is not relevant anymore.  If Ukrainian resistance is loyal to the sovereign government of Ukraine and they are operating behind the lines but in contested territory then I'm inclined to keep them under a sovereign umbrella.\n\nBut...as in Germany, where de-Nazification did not happen all at once or as in the aftermath of the American Civil War, if at some point a territory is no longer merely occupied but is meaningfully incorporated into a sovereign government and is under self-rule, then yes we are dealing with radicals again.\n\nAdmittedly there are some shades of gray to all this but clearly what is and is not a radical can change based on context alone.",

Nowadays it is referred simply as Hinduism and mostly limited to Bali, as the trading ports of Java gradually converted to Islam and central power faltered due to civil wars. Eventually the coastal cities grew into sultanates and subdued the Majapahit court. The courtiers of Majapahit then (according to popular belief at least) found refuge in neighboring Bali.",

The various Hindu gods were definitely not unknown even in rural areas. It does seem however that Indic influence was more deeply rooted in Java and Bali, and less so perhaps in the Malay states, not to mention the eastern islands. \n\nKeep in mind that by the 14th century Hinduism and Buddhism has been the predominant religious force in the archipelago for 8 centuries or so.",

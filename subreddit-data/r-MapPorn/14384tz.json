Every region of Ukraine, including Crimea, voted in favour of independence.\n\nAs for the republics themselves, it's worth noting that they neither had free elections (the results were rigged, just like every other Russian referendum in Ukraine), nor were independent (as anyone with eyes can see, they followed Moscow's line on basically everything).",

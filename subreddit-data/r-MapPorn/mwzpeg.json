I recently saw [a great video](https://youtu.be/KWWoDoMKiuY) about \"ecological amnesia\", basically the idea that our perception of what is natural is incredibly short-lived anyway. For example, as the video points out, Greece once had lions. \n\nNative is relative. How long do horses have to live in North America to be \"native\"? There is a population currently there, and yes, that population is only a few centuries old, but they're probably not going anywhere. \n\nnb. the video's in French, but I think it's got English subs, that channel usually does.",

You can see them just by driving in highway and 80% of the time you'll find a truck that has at least 3 camels in it. If you go through rural areas you'll find a shephard with a herd of at least 20 camels. There are even restraunts that sell camel meat kebabs lol.\n\nHowever I do understand if you haven't come across any, to see them you'd have to actively travel through a lot of rural areas. I have my relatives in a rural town that I visit regularly every 2 weeks or so (not that much anymore due to the pandemic) and we make a lot of fishing trips to river banks in the middle of nowhere in the desert and travel a lot through provinces so camels are a pretty normal sight for me.",

There has been a slow adoption of this, though most advocacy groups believe that wide spread acceptance could do a lot for Elephant conservation. By dividing Elephants into three groups, they can be given more protection",

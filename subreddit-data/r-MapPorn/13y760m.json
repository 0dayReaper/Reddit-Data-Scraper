Initially it was used to refer to the Volsci tribes of Celts who neighboured Germania to the south, but as the Romans encroached on Germania it started to mean \"Roman\", similar to how \"Barbarian\" was a Greek and Latin word used to describe \"non-Greek/Latin-speaking-people\". It got into Slavic languages through Gothic, and it's the same root all over Europe when Germans had to call their Romance-speaking neighbours, such as Walacchia/Vlach (as South Slavs called Romanians), Walloon (as the Germanic Dutch called the French-speaking Walloons), and Wales (Romano-British inhabitants of Britain, when the Germanic Anglo-Saxons came to the island).\n\nEven in Germany, Italy was called Welschisland until the 14th Century (and the Italian city of Brescia is still called Welsch-Brixen, or \"Italian Brixen\" by the Germans to distinguish it from Brixen/Bressanone, which has historically been German-speaking).\n\nInterestingly, Hungarian Olaszoszag comes from the same root (Wlosh/(w)Olasz)",

Don't ask me why, because L (Lambda), P (Pi) and D (Delta) are all kinda the same shape. So it's Greek on acid, except when it's not.\n\nBackwards R is literally \"Ya\". Like the name Maria can end with the backwards R. So Maria is spelled M, A, the letter P because P in Greek is Rho, backwards N and finally \"Ya\". So it's Mar-ee-ya.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short, the Orthodox Church spoke Greek, like the rest of the Eastern Roman Empire, so they used the alphabet they had, but Slavic languages have a whole bunch of other sounds, so they had to come up with new characters. Meanwhile the Western Roman Empire was speaking Latin, so they used Latin letters, but Latin didn't cover all the sounds that English speakers say, so they created  j, w, and u.",

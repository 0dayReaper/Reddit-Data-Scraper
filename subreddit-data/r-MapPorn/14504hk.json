After all in those 21 years a lot happened which mainly affected the Ukrainian population. There was mass migration of Ukrainians to Canada and US in that time, many Ruthenians were also polonised, Polish families moved from the west to vast and fertile lands.",

The project failed catastrophically (not gonna explain why) and since then it was Muscovy that drew our borders for us.\n\nIf it were to happen once again, it would be also an union. Since we are in European Union, natural path forward is for Ukraine and Belarus to join. Or for us to leave and create a new union of eastern european countries.",

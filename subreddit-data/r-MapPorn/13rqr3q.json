            "comment": "There's no way the growth of most cities will continue to that degree. Vancouver would have to look like Hong Kong or Bangkok, Toronto like Tokyo. The main factor is that global population growth is decreasing. Immigration will sharply decrease in the next 20 years as countries equalize in standard of living and Canada declines and is less appealing as a destination. Canadian births will decline further as home ownership and quality of life continue to decrease. So most cities will probably double what they are now by 2100 but they won't get close to this map.",

Monuments to man's desire to turn his environment into a prison of the spirit. And not even aesthetically or structurally impressive prisons at that. Not even the villainous grandeur of a Blade Runner style environment. \n\nIn the former Mimico area, the mix of OK and cheesy motels that were on the water until the 90s were in retrospect a much nicer thing to look at than the ghastly towers of the new age. \n\nGiven the pace and number of their construction, I have always wondered who all lived in them. The population has certainly grown, but not by so much. If the city had plowed under a bunch of old residential areas and people needed to be rehoused, then I could see it. Maybe if every single person who has come to TO in the last 30 years all bought a condo, then I could see it.",

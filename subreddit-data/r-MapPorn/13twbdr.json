For Type 2, studies differ from it being partly to mostly inherited; since Type 2 has increased so much in recent years, environment, such as diet, must be a major factor.\n\nPer NIH:\n\nhttps://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/symptoms-causes\n\nWhat causes type 1 diabetes?\n\nType 1 diabetes occurs when your immune system, the body\u2019s system for fighting infection, attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. Scientists think type 1 diabetes is caused by genes and environmental factors, such as viruses, that might trigger the disease. Studies such as TrialNet External link are working to pinpoint causes of type 1 diabetes and possible ways to prevent or slow the disease.\n\nWhat causes type 2 diabetes?\n\nType 2 diabetes\u2014the most common form of diabetes\u2014is caused by several factors, including lifestyle factors and genes.\n\n\nFrom wiki:\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_1_diabetes\n\nGenetics\nType 1 diabetes is partially caused by genetics, and family members of type 1 diabetics have a higher risk of developing the disease themselves. In the general population, the risk of developing type 1 diabetes is around 1 in 250. For someone whose parent has type 1 diabetes, the risk rises to 1\u20139%. If a sibling has type 1 diabetes, the risk is 6\u20137%. If someone's identical twin has type 1 diabetes, they have a 30\u201370% risk of developing it themselves.[29]\n\nAbout half of the disease's heritability is due to variations in three HLA class II genes involved in antigen presentation: HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-DQB1.[29] The variation patterns associated with increased risk of type 1 diabetes are called HLA-DR3 and HLA-DR4-HLA-DQ8, and are common in people of European descent. A pattern associated with reduced risk of type 1 diabetes is called HLA-DR15-HLA-DQ6.[29] Large genome-wide association studies have identified dozens of other genes associated with type 1 diabetes risk, mostly genes involved in the immune system.[29]",

The deal was rejected, but the US got a military base on Greenland which essentially accomplished half their targeted goal of annexing the land in the first place. \n\nAlso a fun fact: before selling Alaska, the Russians tried to colonize NA and had colonies in California. These too proved indefensible, and they abandoned them.",

Hooper, was seeking the Jeannette and two missing whalers in addition to conducting general exploration. It included naturalist John Muir, who published the first description of Wrangel Island. In the same year on 23 August, the USS Rodgers, commanded by Lieutenant R. M. Berry during the second search for the Jeannette, landed a party on Wrangel Island that stayed about two weeks and conducted an extensive survey of the southern coast.",

That hunting quickly turned into otter genocide, so by the 19th century there were barely any profitable animals left in Alaska. In their last years the Russian settlements were so desperate that they tried to make a living by selling ice to California, but that didn't even cover the maintenance costs of the colony, so the central government was only happy to sell this drain of treasury money. That was before the gold rush, of course.",

Back then, Canada wasn't Canada but part of the British Empire. Regardless, it might seem like a more obvious choice to sell Alaska to them instead, but neither side wanted that to happen. Russia and Britain were rivals at the time, so Russia wouldn't have had any interest in giving them a coastline so close to their own. And Britain wasn't particularly interested either, they had adequate access to the North Pacific via British Columbia already. \n\n[History Matters has a good short video on the topic.](https://youtu.be/BoR_k4Go9W8)",

Plenty of people named Hansen (Norway) haven't actually had anyone named Hans in their family tree for a long time. By contrast, blue names are literally based on your parents: most people names J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir (Iceland) actually do have a father named J\u00f3n.\n\nAccording to this map, Ivanov is common in Belarus because there are literally lots of fathers named Ivan, whereas Ivanov(a) is common in Russia without having that literal meaning. In the case of Andorra, maybe it's that Garcia there has nothing to do with parents and is only popular because it literally means \"young\". \n\nIdk if any of the data in this map is actually correct, but definitely the same name *could* be colored differently in different countries.",

But you wouldn't think of that. Garcia is a well known patronimic. And it's a surname, so it would have nothing to do with popularity.\n\nWhat I findinteresting is that in Latin America Garc\u00eda is only the most common surname in Ecuador. It is just so common in Spain. On the other hand the most common patronimic (red) surnames in those Latin American countries are also super-common in Spain.",

For example, \u201cMac\u201d is the Irish for son, so \u201cMac Murchadh\u201d means \u201cson of Murphy\u201d. \u201cMhic Murchadh\u201d means \u201cwife of the son of Murphy\u201d. But it wasn\u2019t a strict patronymic system like in some countries, just whatever was a convenient way to differentiate people. Most current Murphy probably started out a \u201c\u00d3 Murchadh,\u201d which means either \u201cgrandson of\u201d or \u201cdescendant of,\u201d so more like a clan affiliation than a patronymic.\n\nThey\u2019re all just last names now, of course, but that\u2019s where all of those Irish \u201cO\u201d names come from.",

Heavily British (English and Scottish) area historically with some French closer to Detroit as well as some Dutch and Irish, and it was still almost 100% white in the 90s. Definitely saw the Murphy name as well. Still is heavily white outside of London and Windsor/Leamington.\n\nI don\u2019t think I ever met a Smith in the few years I lived in Toronto though, and then as you get further east in Ontario there\u2019s greater French influence.\n\nThe US and Canada are diverse enough that Smith would not be the most common surname in every state and province. I highly doubt it would be the most common in California nowadays, and definitely not in Quebec at any time in the history of the Americas. Haven\u2019t come across any Smiths in BC either; at least in the Vancouver area, Sandhu may be the most common nowadays.",

And strangely enough, it doesn't have to be literal, as in you could be called \"father of a camel\".\n\nThe closest thing representing a surname in Arabic is probably royal dynasties, ex. \"Al-Saud\".",

Karelian families in the Finnish Lakelands started using male line family names in late prehistory (in Finnish context, meaning before Swedish rule), and Korhonen is one among them. It appears that the society used some kind of a clan-esque system for representation, but as no direct records exist, nothing entirely accurate can be said of it (the Swedes have recorded that the Karelians thought that the Swedish system didn't differ much, and indeed the Svea and other Swedish ancient petty kingdoms had clan-esque representative systems where the families/clans would vote for a king, usually from amongst the most influential/strongest clans).\n\nAll of the ancient Karelian surnames have the -nen diminutive suffix, but not all -nen names belong to them.",

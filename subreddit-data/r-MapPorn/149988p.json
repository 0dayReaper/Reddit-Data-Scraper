            "comment": "**Rut** is an indicator that describes how sharply/impressively the surroundings of a location rise above the location. Among its applications, it is particularly useful for identifying cities with epic mountain backdrops. Roughly speaking, it works like this:\n\n - The higher the mountains rise above the city, the more impressive the mountains appear, and the greater the rut.\n - The higher *angle* at which the mountains rise above the city's horizon, the more impressive the mountains appear, and the greater the rut.\n\nI give a more in-depth description of how rut works in my [**research paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01600).\n\nThe tier list below is just for fun, and the cutoffs are rather arbitrary points on a continuous spectrum, so please don't feel too sad if your city didn't get into the tier you hoped for :)\n\n**S tier** - rut above 500 meters - world-class mountain scenery; would visit for mountain views alone:\n- [**Palm Springs**](https://www.geoffreymoore.com/uploads/palm-springs-winter-min.jpg) (749 m), [**Yosemite Valley**](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Yosemite_Valley_from_Wawona_Tunnel_view%2C_vista_point..JPG) (712 m), [**Weed**](https://alumni.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Weed_fp.png) (636 m), [**Lone Pine**](https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/17/32/ca/06/photo3jpg.jpg?w=500&amp;h=300&amp;s=1) (520 m)\n\n**A tier** - rut between 200 and 500 meters - impressive, but probably wouldn't visit for mountain views alone:\n- Rancho Cucamonga (404 m), Big Sur (336 m), San Bernardino (234 m), Pasadena (213 m),  Yreka (211 m)\n\n**B tier** - rut between 100 and 200 meters - nearby mountains, or distant big mountains:\n- South Lake Tahoe (172 m), Mammoth Lakes (169 m), Redding (128 m), Los Angeles (117 m), Bakersfield (105 m), Fresno (101 m)\n\n**C tier** - rut between 25 and 100 meters - nearby big hills / small mountains, or distant mountains, or very distant big mountains:\n- Long Beach (86 m), San Jose (66 m), Eureka (60 m), San Diego (48 m), Sacramento (30 m)\n\n**D tier** - rut between 10 and 25 meters - nearby hills, or distant big hills / small mountains, or very distant mountains.\n- Paso Robles (22 m), San Francisco (22 m), Stockton (22 m), Daly City (21 m), Davis (15 m)\n\n**F tier** - rut between 0 and 10 meters - flat tier; doesn't exist in California, as hills or mountains are visible anywhere in the state\n- New York City, Kansas City, Miami, and most of the eastern half of the U.S.\n\nNote that rut considers how high the mountains rise above the city, rather than the elevation of the city, hence why high-elevation cities like South Lake Tahoe may be beaten by lower-elevation cities like Palm Springs. Nor does rut consider the \"aesthetics\" of the surrounding mountains (how snowy, sharp, or cool-looking). Furthermore, note that rut describes how impressive the mountains look when viewed from the city, *not* the absolute impressiveness of the mountains themselves. For a measure of a mountain's impressiveness, you might find interest in the [**jut**](http://peakjut.com/) metric instead.\n\nPlease let us know if you have any questions or comments\u2014I'm happy to address them!",

                    "comment": "Great question! Rut is the opposite of jut actually. Whereas jut quantifies how sharply/impressively a point rises above its surroundings, rut quantifies how sharply/impressively the surroundings rise above a point.\n\nRut is akin to jut if the topography was inverted; if the mountains became valleys and valleys became mountains!",

Instead, a rut of X means you're standing underneath a vertical cliff of height X. The lower the angle at which the mountains rise above the city, the less impressive they appear, and the lower the rut.",

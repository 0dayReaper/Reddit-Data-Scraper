Instead, the atmosphere gets denser and denser from the pressure as you go deeper until it gradually transitions to liquid, and then gradually transitions to solid metallic hydrogen (theoretically, anyway - the amount of pressure needed to create metallic hydrogen would destroy just about any other matter and actually can't currently be achieved on Earth).

But walk another kilometer or so and you have our closest star.. Still to scale, except you have to go all around the world and back again. \n\nSpace is so incredibly empty.",

The biggest problem is the gravity.   No one knows what long-term life looks like in low gravity, but Mars is only 1/3rd the gravity of earth - which means it is much closer to gravity on the moon than it is on earth for example.    We do know from the ISS and moon landings that we'd experience rapid muscle loss and bone density loss.  Things like our inner ears and balance don't work as well in low-G either, sleep is hard, immune system plummets, red blood cell counts drop.\n\n\nSo you basically have to fix gravity on Mars or genetically modify humans to adapt to 1/3G as well as line every building on the surface with anti-radiation barriers and build radiation shelters underground everywhere life lives on Mars.\n\nWith extreme global warming double of the worst case scenarios predicted we'd just have people move out of new deserts and flooded areas and deal with the commotion of all of that, but otherwise there isn't any adapting our bodies need at all or new unimaginable technology to be invented.",

I don't believe he's sold that story (cue 5 links to videos of Elon contradicting me, lol)\n\nAs I understand it, Elon is attempting to get Human DNA on a second planet in some kind of functional, self-sustaining way so that if Earth is destroyed by an earth killer asteroid, or life is wiped out by a virus or a solar flare or whatever nasty thing fate dreams up for us, there will be a group of people who could conceivably surivive the event.\n\nIf you weren't referring to Elon specifically but rather a more general escapist tendency, then I can't say I've ever heard of people planning for a Utopia on Mars. The plans I've seen for human life on Mars are realistic, taking into account the innumerable problems with making it happen.\n\n&gt;Let's rather focus on rescuing our own planet instead.\n\nThere are an *awful lot* of people on earth working on that already. Huge numbers of people, some with enormous budgets. The problem is immense but the population of the earth is immense too and there are lots of problems to solve, including space-based ones. If we limit ourselves to solving one problem at a time, or even a set of problems that meet your criteria, we prevent progress that could be occurring in all those other areas. Let people work on other projects, even ones unlikely to succeed, and things you never thought possible can happen.\n\nEdit: To remove inflammatory language.

When Theia hit earth it contributed a lot of it's mass to the earth which gave earth more gravity and a hotter core this ensuring a long lasting magnetic field and atmosphere so that earth didn't end up like mars. Also it formed the moon which has a gravity effect on earth also keeping the core moving and it Stabilizes the earth's axis so that the climate stays relatively similar for millions of years. And lastly it is responsible for tides which form tide pools that are one possible place for the first life in earth. Without this collision we wouldn't be here today.\nIf you add all the unusual things about earth, our solar system and the sun together, then it's not to hard to understand why alien life may be rare.\n\nYou can read more here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Earth_hypothesis",

The amount of space between things in the universe is vastly understated in nearly every way. I mean, someone already said it up higher up in the thread bit you could fit every single planet in this solar system end to end between the earth and its moon, and you could even include Pluto! \"Space is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is.

Russia and NATO have been playing proxy war softball in underdeveloped countries for 40 years and have had no real reason to have a true arms race. \n\nMeanwhile the US, the largest NATO workforce, has been enjoying short lived economic success by outsourcing their worker classes to Chinese manufacturing. At first this was a boon, but later it became a draw as the money started flowing from US exports to Chinese exports and we're just now starting to realize when you outsource the workers/manufacturing you eventually outsource your middle class. \n\nShrinking class mobility ensures less and less tech development as more and more people cannot afford to develop their invention, and college research projects have less funding.\n\nAs a direct result, the rich are shrinking in number but growing in wealth. Soon the wealth discrepancy will be so high, and the corporations so powerful, the government will be weakened and the people will welcome a billionaire as a new Cesar in a classic coup. This may cause a NE/SW split. \n\nIn the rest of the world, China has taken over the resource rich Africa, by promising wealth in return for outsourcing their own worker class. Russia has eyes on South America to do the same. Russia makes war with NATO once the US has split. The south side takes over Mexico and sides with Russia. The north side creates a new nation with Canada. A war is fought, but geopolitically this may be a loss for the remnants of NATO, seeing as they are surrounded geographically. China remains neutral and plays both sides. They may support Russia once things get desperate. \n\nA period of peace until Russia decides it wants China out of 1. The Middle East and then 2. Northern Africa. \n\nI'm very high.",

It completely removes agency from Africans and just assumes that they are making bad decisions for their countries, despite the data telling us loudly and clearly that these countries (and their people) have benefited much more from Chinese partnerships than U.S., Russian (to the extent they've maintained economic influence in Africa post USSR), and European ones.\n\nThere are many default criticisms of wealthy countries exploiting the labor power of poorer countries that China should also be criticized for, especially given the fact that their official state ideology pays substantial homage to socialist internationalism, but no objective analyst would say that China's engagement in Africa (and elsewhere) is worse than other global powers. If anything, their engagement has been much better for those countries.",

The risk profile doesn't make sense.  If they're going to attack, they're going after the main island.",

The PRC acknowledges Taiwan's existence, and their defacto administrative control over the \"breakaway\" provinces.

This is a major facet of the One China policy.\n\nAnother facet of One China is that they do not want *other* nations to have separate dealings with Taiwan. Beijing says that if you want to deal with Taiwan, you have to go through China. You can't open an embassy in Taiwan, because you already have one in Beijing and \"it's the same country\". That's the sort of thing they mostly insist on.",

It's a breakaway state from the civil war. It's the confederate states or Vichy France (without the slavery or Nazism). How China interacts with them is a domestic affair, not equivalent to Russia's interactions with Ukraine for example. It is an internal chinese dispute, between the governments of the PRC and ROC to resolve, hopefully not through war.\n\nThis is why (most likely) the only reason that China would invade is if Taiwan declared its independence, not as a goverment of China but as a separate state, because this would be a unilateral solution to the Taiwan question.\n\nTaiwan doesn't have good reason to declare independence knowing this, and the only other thing that would significantly change the status quo is American intervention.",

This is a stupid scenario that would never happen but let\u2019s pretend it anyway. \n\nEven then, PLAN simply doesn\u2019t have the capacity. The Chinese military hasn\u2019t fought an action since the 1970s, and they didn\u2019t exactly cover themselves in glory then. They\u2019re a paper force at present. And Taiwan has a population of 24 million, an active military of 160k, and a mobilization reserve of about 1.5 million. It\u2019s also a paper force right now, but it\u2019s one where everyone would be fighting to defend their homes against an existential threat. So PLAN would need to put at least 160k and probably more like 300-500k across the Formosa Strait, plus heavy equipment, AND keep them resupplied, all in the face of heavy resistance from a high tech modern force. \n\nAnd even if PLAN did have that capacity - which they do not - the geography of Taiwan is enormously unfavorable to invasion. The entire eastern half of the island is huge and rugged mountains. It\u2019s a natural fortress. That\u2019s why the Allied war planners dismissed it as a possible invasion in WWII. \n\nAnd even if PLAN had the capacity and the island was as flat as a plate, the Taiwanese people will NEVER accept Communist Chinese rule. Their entire national identity is built around endless opposition to that. It would be a bloodbath of insurgencies and constant fighting even without US intervention and resupply. \n\nAnd that\u2019s in an unrealistically limited scenario. Add into that the fact that there is zero chance that PLAN crosses the Formosa Strait without first fighting and defeating the US Navy and it just becomes a daydream.",

My statement was that China will attack only if the US is preoccupied with something else or is guaranteed not to intervene.

Taiwan simply isn't going to allow a blockade to last. It cannot afford to.\n\nTaiwan relies heavily on energy and food imports. A blockade will quickly result in hyperinflation and nation-wide rotating black-outs that are no different to a war-time economy. It will already be an existential threat to the people, and hence will demand an existential response, i.e. firing upon the Chinese blockading ships and making loud noises internationally asking for US intervention.\n\nAnd China of course knows this.\n\nUltimately, a blockade will just be as bad for China as invading Taiwan. So there's no reason for China to blockade Taiwan. It would be more benefitial to just invade. Blockading Taiwan without sending in troops to occupy Taiwan would give Taiwan valuable time to rally international support and give the US time to prepare an even better response.\n\nAnd all that was true already before the Ukraine War. Now, with Japan militarizing and the US more committed, it is clear that there will be an immediate US-Japan response to a Chinese blockade. So the option doesn't even exist now.\n\nChina cannot blockade Taiwan, both because they know it gains them nothing, and because the US and Japan has already made strategic deployments that are obviously and clearly aimed at securing the eastern side of Taiwan, allowing the US to establish a safe supply route into Taiwan.",

Taiwan is not going to let an amphibious invasion get that close without doing serious damage.\n\nYou might say that the invasion of Normandy was a similar distance but the Nazis had the vast majority of their force in the east fighting the Russians. Technology has also advanced quite a lot as well in the 80 years since Normandy and can strike much further. Intelligence used to get a build up of troops is much better and you will need a huge build up of troops and naval power to even attempt an invasion. There are so many other factors at play that make this a more difficult invasion.\n\nAlso China might have greater general industrial power but the US has an unmatched military industry complex. China might hypothetically be able to shift their commercial industry to a military industry that might outmatch the US that is not going to happen fast or without notice. Currently the Chinese arms industry is 7 or 8 times smaller than that of the US and its not going to surpass that any time soon and if they tried to rush it the quality of it will poor.\n\nI am very critical of the US in general but their military for how much damage it does to many places is unmatched for good reason.",

Whether or not the world\n\nFlying missions from US occupied Germany took a US airforce mobilized to near WW2 levels and they were only travelling several hundred kilometers for the span of one year. Further,  the real damage of the airlift to the Soviets was the embargo on Soviet goods that went along with it. There's simply no way for the US to enact a full embargo on Chinese goods in the same manner -- in the late 40s, the US had the strongest industrial and manufacturing sector in the world by miles. Now China is the world's leading manufacturer, and a similar embargo would immediately cripple the US and lead to a worldwide economic depression. Remember, the only reason the US is drawing this red line is because it is dependent on Taiwanese microchip manufacturing -- they wouldn't give half a shit otherwise.\n\nIMO the handover of Taiwan is basically an inevitability and will almost certainly happen within this century. The only question is whether we are willing to negotiate some sort of settlement or whether we (the US) decide to blow up the world over it.",

It's important to remember this. US politicians have been agitating for Taiwanese independence recently to score domestic political points, as part of a broader trade-war with China, and because some of them may have talked themselves into believing that they are actually crusaders for democracy. They're not, they're acting in what they call \"US strategic interests,\" which is pushing us to the brink of war.",

As as a naval blockade of Taiwan also means a naval blockade of Japan and Korea as almost all of their shipping passes through the Taiwan Strait.\n\nAnd then there's also the US possibly getting involved and sanctions that could be put on China as a reaction to the blockade. If the same sanctions that are put on Russia would be put on China, China would suffer far more than Russia does.",

Taiwan is within rocket artillery range of the Chinese mainland, and well within the range of land-based aircraft, so they don't need carriers to blockade Taiwan. Further, the US doesn't have hypersonic missile technology yet, so yeah while the Chinese fleet would have to deal with anti-ship missiles, they would have plenty of relatively easy to come by countermeasures for those missiles. The US has no defense against a hypersonic missile at the moment, and given their range of 900 miles or so, they wouldn't even be able to fly unrefueled sorties from carriers without putting the entire battle group at risk.\n\nThe OP was absolutely right, geography is not on the US's side, and moreover the US public is not going to watch their administration tank the world economy and sacrifice tens of thousands of lives to enforce an overt independent status that most Taiwanese don't even really want. It's one thing to waste billions of dollars on proxy wars against Russia, but to ask Americans to put their own children's lives on the line in a war that will totally cut off their supply of treats and other consumer goods is really beyond the pale. Americans that believe that a war with China is somehow winnable are engaging in magical thinking.",

Retaking Taiwan would require complete suppression of Chinese air and naval power, which would probably risk nuclear war and might not even be possible as they catch up. \n\nIf the Chinese military develops and produces enough of the right systems, they will be able to invade Taiwan quickly enough that they would win. Taiwan is currently struggling to move to an asymmetric warfare doctrine, which leaves them very vulnerable for the next few years at a minimum. China will invade if it thinks the odds are in its favor.",

We, the average American people, would either get conscripted to go die to protect the economic interests of the American elite or we would be eviscerated in nuclear hellfire if we're lucky enough to live near strategic hardpoint/city.\n\nThis country has so many problems already without starting a third world war. The American economy is on the verge of a breakdown, the likes of which haven't been seen in nearly a century, mass incarceration, a working class that is getting squeezed so hard that people can barely survuve working insane hours, the stripping away of civil and sexual rights, the far right neo-nazi fucks weaseling their way into an already rotten political system with the help of Evangelical \"Christians\" funding, corporate consolidation, a huge percentage of the population suffering from obesity due in large part to agribusiness lobbying to protect corn subsidies, I'm mean jesus fuck I could go on but I think I've gotten the point across.

There also seems to be more willingness from the USA to intervene directly, and even if there wasn't it could do things like guard ships through a blockade which would put China in the position of either fighting the Americans at sea, or having a tougher war on the island.\n\nAlso, it wouldn't be NATO anyway; this would be the USA and its Pacific allies who (except for Canada) aren't in the alliance.",

But you're placing a lot more enthasis on spending and it doesn't directly translate they way you think it does. \n\nSo to start with, you're comparing the current Ukraine spend while at war against Taiwan in peace time. Prior to the war breaking out Ukraine spent roughly 1/4 of what Taiwan spends. So Taiwan would be coming into this hypothetical war with a much more capable miltary for their needs than Ukraine did. \n\nSecond point, Ukraine and Taiwan have very different military needs and the costs involved vary massively. For example, Taiwan is a very urbanised and mountainous island. Tanks are extremely expensive and would have limited impact on the Island. You've also got to think of the costs of logistics too. The costs involved in Ukraine will far outstrip whatever the cost would be on a relatively small island. \n\nThird point, China and Russia have their own defence industries that will be sucking up huge portions of their military budgets. Taiwan will be purchasing already tried and tested hardware from the west. They're not sinking as much of their budget into developing new equipment. The cost involved here cannot be understated. Even the wealthy west has a hardtime paying the costs involved with developing modern military equipment. There's a reason why the west tends to use similar equipment and pool their resources. Even the US sometimes struggles with the costs involved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's a lot more point that can be made but I'm hoping you understand what I'm getting at here. Raw numbers doesn't translate directly to military capability.",

But having poorer teams play giants in hopes that one of them won't get humiliated is not the way. The fact there are multiple strong teams in London alone is not some sort of conspiracy. It's simply because a team based in a large city has it easier filling stadiums, not to mention sports academy and other inherent advantages of operating where a lot of people live. Multiply this by several big cities and you get a top European league. Countries vary in size, from tens of millions citizens, to microstates. Why would one team get a free pass over a dozen better ones just because it's from a small country?",

Vaduz their best team is in the 2nd tier but were in the Swiss first tier up to a couple of years ago and qualified for the conference league group stages last season. They'd probably be OK in the Vanarama if not league 2.\n\nI'd also be inclined to think Linfield and TNS might also be OK in the Vanarama but it's not guaranteed and would depend on what sort of money they have behind them\n\nAndorra has a side now in the Spanish 3rd tier who'd probably be OK at that level too but they obviously don't play in the Andorran league which would not be very strong\n\nEdit: my mistake FC Andorra are actually in the Spanish 2nd tier now so surely quite a bit better than English 4th/5th tier level",

They got to keep the CL win though because the evidence was only domestic and UEFA didn't want to look too hard and taint their competition.  Players also said they got injections before big games and that they didn't know what for, but they felt it helped them.  Tony cascarino for example has said he didn't question it at the time, but looking back he feels it's 99% likely to be doping.  The sample have been tested a few times and found nothing, although not everything can be tested for especially on old samples.",

This change together with the seeding rules that assure that the elite clubs largely avoid each other until the later stages of the competition, has trapped the trophy between a handful of clubs. Between 1977 and 1997 out of the 21 winning clubs, 12 were first timers. From 1998 until 2022, of the 25 winning clubs, only one has been a first timer in this period-Chelsea. Man City might be the second one. It\u2019s no coincidence. Teams that make it far get most of the revenue. So there is a loop in place. Clubs that make it far into the competition win money and prestige. Money and prestige attracts top talent, top talent brings success, success brings money and prestige. The only way to break into this loop is by having a Russian oligarch or a Middle Eastern monarch as owner.",

Since 2017, Steaua Bucuresti changed its name to FCSB ([new logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ro/thumb/c/cb/FCSB_logo.svg/1200px-FCSB_logo.svg.png)) and another team was founded(kinda controversial term, there's an entire debate on which team was founded and when) under the name of Steaua Bucuresti. \n\nRight now in Romania the Steaua Bucuresti fanbase is split in 2: the FCSB fans (one of the biggest romanian football teams, somehow recognized by the uefa as the successor of Steaua) and Steaua fans (the successor of Steaua under the romanian law, smaller team in second league). \n\nSteaua Bucuresti is currently owned by the state. Even if Steaua Bucuresti finished on the first place in their league, they can't promote to the first league because of the romanian law.",

In any country such a situation would have occurred, the supporters would have followed the team that has the trophies and emblems. The case of Belenenses from Portugal is similar to that of the Steaua club. True fans from all over the world would have followed the team even in a lower league, knowing that there is the real team. That's the difference between plastic and result supporters and real fans who follow the team anywhere even in lower divisions. \n\nAccording to the High Court of Cassation and Justice in Romania, FCSB has NOTHING at the moment to prove that it is the continuation of STEAUA BUCHAREST! Instead, the propaganda of the fcsb continues to be supported by the press enslaved to the one who leads that commercial company FCSB and has great influence among journalists precisely to misinform the public opinion in Romania.\n\nCSA Steaua Bucure\u0219ti has won three lawsuits in Romania (2014 - High Court of Justice; 2016, 2021 - Court of Appeal) against Football Club FCSB.\nOur Justice has definitive and irrevocable decided that Football Club FCSB, club founded in 2003 in Ilfov county, is not the real CSA Steaua Bucharest (Army club founded in 1947).\nFrom 2003 to 2014, FC FCSB has illegally used the identity of CSA Steaua Bucharest (in national league and european competitions) - High Court of Justice decided in 2014.\nAlso, our Justice has decided that Football Club FCSB does not own Steaua's historical records and FC FCSB has no legal right to use the name \u201cSteaua Bucharest\u201d or Steaua\u2019s brand/logo.\nCSA Steaua Bucharest holds the historical record from the period 1947-1998, the judges decided. According Justice, CSA Steaua is the former European Champions Cup winner in 1986 and former finalist in 1989.\nIn 2018, CSA Steaua Bucharest has notified UEFA about these court decisions.\nDespite these final decisions of the Romanian Justice, FRF (Romanian Football Federation) did not inform UEFA about the fact that Football Club FCSB uses CSA Steaua's identity illegally and fraudulently.\nFor this reason, the UEFA website still presents FC FCSB as the real Steaua Bucharest. (1986 European Champions Cup winner in 1986 and 1989 finalist)\nAccording Justice, FC FCSB was directly registered in Liga 1 (premier league in Romania) in february 2003 on the real CSA Steaua Bucharest place.\nFrom 2003 to 2014, FC FCSB has illegally used the name and identity of Steaua Bucharest in all European competitions. although the justice court decided on this matter, mass media is trying as much as possible to support fcsb since it's widely known that the owner of fcsb is a popular and powerful figure that can bribe and buy people's influence so therefore many journalist are trying to be on his side...",

As a Brazilian, I have the thought that the football/soccer played in Portugal has a similar level as the Brazilian one, even in a lower level for the greatest part of the Portuguese teams, and the French teams in the past were more great and they deserved more trophies",

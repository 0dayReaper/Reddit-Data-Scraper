But, to anyone jumping straight to \"racism\", I think you should look inwards.\n\nAn IQ # is indicative of how someone scored on a standardized IQ test. These numbers have very little to do with one's ethnicity, or \"race\" and a lot more with education, standards of living (access to food, healthcare, etc.), financial and political stability, etc. So, if you look at an IQ number and automatically equivalate it to \"race\", you just might be the one having the racist thought...",

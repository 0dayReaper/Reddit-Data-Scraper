Italy for example is \"An Iod\u00e1il\", not Iod\u00e1il. Ireland, Scotland and England do not use the definite article. England is Sasana, Scotland is Albain and Ireland is \u00c9ire.\n\nThere is a very nuanced distinction for Northern Ireland. In the south, we often say **Tuaisceart na h\u00c9ireann** (The North of Ireland), but **Tuaisceart \u00c9ireann** is \"Northern Ireland\". It really just depends on what your political views are or if you see the island of Ireland as a single nation or not. I tend to use Tuaisceart na h\u00c9ireann.\n\nSome of those place names are not countries.\n\nI do love the place name for Newfoundland, as it's the only country (or land) outside of Ireland with a native Irish name. Talamh an \u00c9isc (Land of the fish). Lots of Irish fisherman migrated there in the 1700 and 1800's due to the plentiful shoals of fish in its waters and they came from regions of Ireland which were Irish speaking.",

What we are discussing is the concept of a nation, and how it doesn't always completely overlap with a legally defined state. \n\nTo most Irish people, we view the entire island as the Irish nation and that is reflected in our language. \n\nLook at Native-American tribes where their tribal nations span the borders of both Canada and the US. They have names in their native languages for the lands of their tribe, that won't directly correlate with the legal names for the US or Canada. Are you suggesting they stop using the native names for their lands, because they aren't legally defined sovereign states?",

In the same respect, Irish people often see the island of Ireland as our **nation** and that is reflected in our language.\n\nI was the one who initially pointed out the distinction between Tuaisceart na h\u00c9ireann and Tuaisceart \u00c9ireann to give a balanced view on naming for the region. I don't care if anybody uses the latter, I don't police the names people use for places. Remember, Irish didn't even receive official status until last year in Northern Ireland.

It comes from Helvetia, which I believe is the personification of Switzerland. \n\nI didn't know about Norway, so this is stolen from u/Faelchu on another post:\n\nNorway's name in Irish is \"an Iorua\". An Iorua comes from Middle Irish \"Ir\u00faaith\". This in turn was borrowed from H\u01ebr\u00f0(a), plural H\u01ebr\u00f0ar. The H\u01ebr\u00f0ar were a Norse tribe anglicised in Irish literature as Haereth and in other English literature as the Harudes or Charudes and Gaelicised as Iruaid and Iruath. Many Irish placenames simply adopted the tribal name of the area as the name for the geographic entity, cf. Connachta = Connacht/Connaught, Laigin = Leinster, Ulaidh = Ulster, Sasainn/Sacsainn/Sasanaibh = Sasana = England, etc. H\u01ebr\u00f0(a) &gt; Iruaid &gt; Ir\u00faaith &gt; Iorua.\r  \n\r  \nMeanwhile, the Norse H\u01ebr\u00f0aland later became Norwegian Hordaland, a county or fylke in southwest Norway with its municipal seat in Bergen.",

Then further research I found out my maternal ancestors were from Ulster so they wouldn\u2019t have spoken Gaelic regardless.\n\nI took several years of Mandarin and found it easier then Gaelic. The Chinese writing system is definitely hard but the grammar is super easy and simple. People say Mandarin is hard because of the tones but if you master the tones and the pinyin Latin alphabet system you can basically teach yourself.\n\nGaelic grammar seems similar to Arabic in that verbs and pronouns change considerably depending on the tense, situation, who is talking to who, plural non plural etc. not like Romance or Latin based languages where verbs and stuff have a simple algebraic like formula to follow",

There are exceptions with weird conjugations, but those are far and few between. Once you master Spanish then Italian, Portuguese and even French become much easier since they more or less have the same grammar as Spanish",

When the context is specific but unclear, the term may be qualified, as Irish Gaelic, Scottish Gaelic or Manx Gaelic. Historically the name \"Erse\" was also sometimes used in Scots and then in English to refer to Irish;[26] as well as Scottish Gaelic.\n\nGoidelic is a synonym of Gaelic, used mainly in linguistic typology and historical linguistics.

Of all the people who live in an area (who are of working age), how many of them have jobs? \u201cUnemployment rate\u201d generally means: of all the people looking for work, how many of them have been unable to find work?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The difference, of course, is that many people (students, retired, etc.) live in an area, but are not actively seeking a job. The \u201cemployment rate\u201d counts those people as \u201cnot employed\u201d, but the \u201cunemployment rate\u201d does not count people in that category as \u201cunemployed\u201d, because they aren\u2019t seeking employment.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The difference is whether the lack of employment is voluntary or involuntary.\n\n[https://www.epi.org/newsroom/useful\\_definitions/](https://www.epi.org/newsroom/useful_definitions/)\n\n&gt;Employment rates are calculated as the ratio of the employed to the working age population.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Unemployed persons are defined as those who report that they are without work, that they are available for work and that they have taken active steps to find work in the last four weeks",

The countries having the lowest employment rates in this map combine low female participation rates with men (and women) getting paid under the table.",

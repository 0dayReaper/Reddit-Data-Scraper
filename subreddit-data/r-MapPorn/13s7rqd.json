            "comment": "It's strange to call these 'Feudal wars' because these maps depict battles and campaigns on the level of the empires at this time. They were constituted of a lot of feudal lords under the highest leadership, but a real feudal war would be between lesser feudal lords under the same big empire. Historiography in the last 20 years has been very critical about 'feudalism' as a concept for many reasons.\n\nIt is still a very nice and cool map though! But being from 1965 it does not use the correct terminology for these wars.",

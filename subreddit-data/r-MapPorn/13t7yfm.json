            "comment": "This is actually about as good a treaty as Hungary could have gotten in terms of self-determination, although having a chunk of one country's territory completely surrounded by a neighboring state without even a coastline is really asking for trouble. \n\nAnd why wouldn't Horthy have allied with Germany in WW2 if Hungary had these borders? After all, the Romanians, Bulgarians, and some Croats allied with the Germans. The Germans were not regarded as the EVIL NAZIS going into WW2 --- they were instead just neighbors who had close economic ties with them and would help the governments stay in power against communists and the Soviets. Also, at the time, especially after the Fall of France, it looked like the Germans were going to win the war, so why choose to defy the Germans instead of cooperating and being on the winning side?",

So in order to free as many land and people possible, it HAD to ally itself with one of the 2 evils because these were the only 2 superpowers in its region. Germany was probably chosen because of 2 main reasons: 1. The regime in power at that time in Romania was far right too, so easier to approach the germans. 2. The population in Bessarabia and Northern Bucovina, occupied by the USSR, had the smallest chance to survive a new forced assimilation, deportations, executions, etc. It was also the region that joined Romania in 1918 that was the poorest, least educated and most denationalized of them all (russified).",

Hungary had longstanding friendly ties with Germans and economically linked. I suspect that even in the scenario with the map, the German would have offered them the land between Hungary and the chunk of Hungary in Romania as incentive, along with Transcarpathian Ruthenia, because in the real world, the Germans in fact DID give it to them. Both of those were major gains for Hungary, plenty of booty.\n\nAn alliance with Germany was clearly the most likely outcome here, even with the revised borders. In my opinion of course!",

I kind of compare it to Armenia today.\n\nI think neutrality would have been the best option, but that's only because of hindsight.\n\nAt the time, it looked like Germany was just going to dominate the continent, and it didn't look like there was going to be an alternative. Staying neutral would have meant no gains, and their people knew this. There was immense pressure from the right/conservative side to try to capitalize on the situation as much as possible and get some territory back, because it looked like if they didn't join in, they would miss the bus.\n\nIt also helped, for whatever reasons that I still don't understand, that Hitler didn't seem to consider Hungarians subhuman, and didn't seem to have any grand designs on the country, nor did he seem interested in turning it into living space (the jewish population not withstanding).\n\nIt also helped that the Soviets weren't seen in a good light and so the people would rather have the friendly devil they know rather than the one they don't.\n\nI agree that the Germans would have probably just taken over anyway at some point, but at least then the perception would have looked a lot different and Hungary would have been considered a victim of the war instead of a collaborator. It may have even been able to avoid Soviet occupation in that case, but that's just speculation on my part.",

For small territorial parts of Berlin and Vienna, Soviets got big territories of Germany and other countries freed by western allies. Thuringia, for example, was entirely freed by Americans, yet transfered into the Soviet zone and later became part of East Germany hosting the Soviet army. Significant parts of Czechoslovakia were freed by western allies too. Thuringia and other territories were good grounds for a possible war with the West, while West Berlin was completely surrounded by the Soviet army and offered only troubles for the West from military viewpoint.\n\nOnly very small part of Austria was freed by the Soviets, but since Vienna is placed basically on Austria's eastern border, it included the capital. Russians were worried that Austria would join NATO like the Western Germany did. And making whole of Austria neutral heavily favored them even by its own. Go look how Belgium's neutrality helped them during the WW1 or WW2. Authoritarian states would have no problem attacking a neutral country if they have a good opportunity or consider it important and while its a diplomatic hit, nobody would defend. Russia has a long list of attacking neutral countries. At the same time, its very uncommon for western democracies to break their international agreements.\n\nSo, if Russians freed only a small part of Hungary and they had an opportunity to trade it for something bigger, then maybe it could happen. But a scenario where they have a control of whole Hungary and they just give it up willingly for no gains... thats just not their way.",

The Carpathians form a natural boundary.\n\nThis is a part of Russian propaganda. That they need to expand because they need to defend themselves. You talk about Carpathians, yet the USSR annexed Zakarpattya, which is on the other side of the mountains. More controlled territory is always better. If you have an ability to occupy something without bad consequences, do it. **Then you can always find excuses and make up arguments why you had to do it.**\n\n&gt; This wasn't done in a tit-for-tat manner.\n\nEverything was done in a tit-for-tat manner from the Soviet side. If they were giving something up, its only for getting something better. Im sorry if you dont see it or how favorable for the Russians all the outcome was.\n\nAnother thing people often mention is how the USSR let Finland go. Which never happened. The Red Army never had control of Finland. Finland saw Germany is going to lose and betrayed Germany in 1944 switching their side. Finland gave the USSR a lot of territories and started fighting on allies side. They cleared Finland from Nazis themselves and were helping the Red Army.\n\nThe USSR took the deal, because it was still 1944, they were given free land and support to push fast in Eastern Europe. Americans and Brits were already invading from the West, so Russians were on a clock. Instead of less important Finland, they could focus their forces to gain controll of strategic places in Central Europe like Eastern Germany or Hungary that we discuss.\n\nAs a result, Finland was never controlled by the Red Army. Everything that was controlled by Soviets after the WW2, they either annexed or turned in their puppet states. Some small pieces were traded for better gains.\n\n&gt; But I think a case could be made that it would have certainly been made more likely.\n\nAnd if you become best bros with Russians and try to install their communist puppet regime in Hungary after the WW1, it will make a chance that they thank you and not murder you higher: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Kun",

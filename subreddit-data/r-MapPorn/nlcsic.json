On the other hand the airport nearest me changed their approach path for the Northerly approach they use in some wind conditions, and now on some days we get a plane flying over at 2000\u2019 gunning their throttle as they turn into final.  Really fucking annoying.\n\n(Ironically we have a naval field nearby, too, which I don\u2019t mind.  I\u2019d much prefer an occasional F35 flying low than a 737 every 3 minutes... and while they might be radar stealthy, those F35s are REALLY LOUD.  Like set off all of the shittier car alarms loud...)",

All IATA countries have high altitude airways which planes follow usually, they dont just fly direct from A to B, they overfly waypoints along the route which keeps them within these corridors. Sometimes there aren't airways available if its a more remote/infrequently traveled area, in which case they use waypoints along the routes (GPS fixes, VOR beacons, etc.). Other places like the north atlantic don't utilize airways either as the routing changes daily (see [NAT (north atlantic track)](https://www.notams.faa.gov/common/nat.html?)) but they instead used published routes which use GPS fixes to account for the current winds. You can see all of the airways for basically the entire world here https://skyvector.com/\n\nYou can see the route that a plane flies at [FlightAware](https://flightaware.com/live/flight/FDX400) on the right side under \"Flight Data\". In the one I linked (just some random flight) its flying this [route](https://flightaware.com/live/flight/FDX400/history/20210526/1314Z/KPDX/KMEM/route): WHAMY4 IMB BOI AUTIM RASCL RZC BRBBQ3\n\nHere's another example of a route, but this one utilizes airways. PPORT3 BAF Q406 BWZ J6 HVQ Q68 BWG BLUZZ3. The airways used are Q406, starting at BAF and ending at BWZ, at which point they switch onto the J6 airways, etc. before begining their approach (STAR) BRBBQ3 which brings them into their arrival airport. \n\nTL:DR planes don't just fly direct from A to B, they use a series of waypoints and airways along their route to direct them.",

Particular flight levels may be controlled by a regional tower or ATC station to keep planes appraised of their surroundings. A possible example being through traffic being ordered to a higher flight level to avoid needing to be guided around descending or holding traffic. \n\nThe lanes develop organically because every pair if points will have a shortest route and airports don't move around.",

The heavier the aircraft, the longer the runway that is needed for the aircraft to stop.  For safety, aircraft runways stopping distances are calculated to include a healthy safety buffer just in case anything goes wrong such as a an airbrake or flaps failure that would hugely increase stopping distance.  Add in a possible 200,000 litres of kerosene to that and its possibly to push the aircraft well into that safe landing distance buffer and possibly off the end of the runway if thigs go *really* wrong.",

There are ways to get ride of the excesses fuel faster (flying dirty; low altitude, slow speed, gear down etc). Or you can just keep making circles. It depends on how much time you have, and how comfortable you need to keep everyone on board.",

In the case of the Boeing 777-200: Maximum take off weight: 545,000 lb / 247,200 kg, \nMaximum landing weight: 445,000 lb / 201,840 kg. This is with a fuel tank capable of holding ~210,000 lbs of fuel, and engines that burn ~6.8t (roughly 15,000lbs) of fuel per hour. Aircrafts have landed above MLW and been alright, but it's definitely not advisable. If it is not an emergency, the better option is to burn fuel until you are below the MLW.\n\nAlso, in emergency situations, risk of fire is also something that is considered - an aircraft landing with a full fuel tank poses more risk for catastrophe upon landing.",

He was the former editor-in-chief of the Telegram channel Nexta, as well as being the chief editor of the Telegram channel \"Belarus of the Brain\". \n\n&gt;Protasevich has been an opposition activist since his youth; he participated in protests in the early 2010s. Since autumn 2011, he has been a member of the opposition organization Young Front. He co-administered a major group in VKontakte, a social network, in opposition to President Alexander Lukashenko until 2012, when it was hacked by the authorities. He studied journalism at Belarusian State University until he was expelled in 2018.\n\n&gt;In 2019, Protasevich moved to Poland. In January 2020, he announced that he asked for political asylum in Poland.\n\n&gt;In August 2020, after Belarusian authorities tried to disable internet access during the 2020 presidential election, Nexta became one of the main sources of information about the protests against alleged rigged elections and started to coordinate the protests.",

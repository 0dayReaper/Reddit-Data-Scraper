You must understand we were part of Austria who was the Kaiser of the HRE back then. And the Kaiser was catholic by definition lol. We started the 30 year war because we elected the Protestant Frederick of Palatinate as Bohemian king. Austria had none of it, we lost and all our protestants were force converted or expelled after 1620. So the situation was different to Germany. After the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 the population was all nominally catholic. Some people risked their lives and secretly worshipped their faith on but the damage was done. After the ban was lifted 100 years later or so and people could legally declare being either catholic or evangelical (that was it) again only handful admitted being evangelical. Add this to Jan Hus an Hussite wars in 15th and Communism in 20th century and you have an atheist state. People saw organized religion a bullshit a long time ago here.",

It was pretty ugly growing up but since a few years it looks like an attractive little town. But you'd earn probably (totally guessed) about 15% more just across the border and I do probably 30% more a bit further away. \n\nThere are still some really fucked up towns. Mostly around old coal industry - however some of them are transformed into recreational zones, they'd flood the old \"daylight\" mines and turn them into lakes with great attractions for tourists. \n\nThe problem is that most young people go to west germany for work not to speak about the people who went to west germany right after the wall came down so there aren't many people left and the population is still shrinking. And there's not really much that'd make me go back.\n\nBecause the youth is missing there's not a lot of cultural activity. Some old friends trying with little activities to change that but it's really hard work. Because of the lacking of younger people who bring fresh ideas there are a lot of old, bitter folks around there who feel betrayed. Also, and this is a bit of a bias, there's a few people without much education so you get quite a high percentage of right wing talk.\n\nThe cultural offerings just like bars, pubs, but also theaters are struggling heavily. What is missing would be a university or campus to bringer younger folks into town and maybe some will drop out and open bars because there would be customers and some of them will stay and open businesses but politics missed that opportunity and it's not really a solution to open a university in every other town.\n\nLeipzig is booming though, that is mostly because it was in the GDR a quite international town and now it focuses a lot on IT which brings companies into town, which then brings younger people who want to work there and they're doing a lot of recreational things there too.\n\nIn the rest of the country they missed opportunities like that. My hometown was huge before the war and still quite big after. We were big in the textile and lace industry but we couldn't compete with chinese industry, it also had a lot to do with reperations to the russians after the war, they took a lot of infrastructure away. \n\nBut I think they missed the opportunity to open a university or even just a campus of another university that specializes in textile industry. You don't need manufacturing there to teach that sort of thing. It all kind of died away now and all the know-how is gone. We were world leading and world-known for lace production. I met old people from Canada who heard about my town and it was connected with high class lace products back in the day.",

The numbers for Norway mentioned are: \n\n5% of Norwegians regularly attend church\n\n37% of Norwegians identify as theists, 39% atheists\n\n75% of the population belongs to the Church of Norway\n\nIn the video he describes many of these church members as \"belonging without believing\", with church membership serving a largely secular purpose, connecting them to their cultural heritage. \n\nBeing from the states, this is a bit surprising. It's not as if there aren't people who lose their faith but remain members of their Church to \"keep up appearances\". But in general church membership is thought of as synonymous with belief. I was raised Catholic, but when I realized I was an atheist I just wasn't a Catholic anymore. Perhaps it's because we have so many different christian churches (in addition to other faiths) and a long tradition of affirmative religious movements (you had to elect to join in): even though most people stick with the same or a similar church to what they grew up with, it's still contextualized like a faith they chose, as if off a supermarket shelf, and it doesn't make sense for an atheist to \"chose\" a faith.",

People's Church) upon being baptised into it, and you have to actively choose to leave. Most people don't choose to leave because there's no real reason to, other than obviously conversion.\n\nThat's why you always see incredibly high religiosity in Nordic countries in statistics. Almost everyone's a member by default and getting out is a hassle without any benefits. \n\nIn my life I've personally known maybe one or two people below 30 who were actively practicing members of the Church of Denmark.",

He wanted to check on the income of the catholic church. What better way to do that by having the state collect their membership fees and do their accounting. \n\nThis was actually abolished under Hitler who did this in order for the church to not voice their opposition against them, but after WWII most West German states except Bavaria took over the collecting again.",

Even in west Germany, almost all the gray areas are historically Protestant (in Ruhrgebiet I think it\u2019s also adding Muslims to the equation and it prevails any Christian denomination). \n\nWhen you look at Europe more broadly, the only Catholic country that went hardcore secular are France and Belgium (and now also Spain), whereas literally all Protestant countries are hardcore secular. \n\nIn the US, it\u2019s a bit more complicated because you have the evangelicals as well, but in the northern states, where there typically would be a mainline Protestant majority, religion is also not very active, unless there are some Catholics, black Protestants or other religions present. Episcopal, Methodist and Lutheran churches in the US are basically dead.",

His point is specifically, why the GDR is such an outlier here.\n\nPersonally, I don't think it was, as you can see very similar effects in Estonia/Latvia, across much of Russian/Ukrainian/Belarusian society and in Azerbaijan.\n\nPoland, while not the only example of religious 'revival', is certainly one of the more extreme examples though. My understanding is that this is predominantly tied to Catholicism and John Paul II's papacy overlapping with Solidarnosc and the fall of communism in Poland and the whole bloc, with Catholicism being seen as a means of soft resistance against Communism and Soviet occupation. I.e. religiousness is particularly high among the 35-40+ demographic, falling quite a bit among younger people like elsewhere.",

Sounds about right. \n\nI was seriously baffled when I met religious persons for the first time because I thought that in our modern time mankind has figured out so much through science that it just makes no sense to believe in gods or to believe that the Earth was created in 7 days, or any of that stuff.

But for us it is the most important that he started to cooperate with catholic church and priests. So while atheism was still mainly promoted, catholic church was accepted, defnitely to the bigger extend than religion in Eastern Germany.",

The Bavaria/rest of Germany divide as well as the general Northeast-Southwest divide has a tinge of the old Catholic/Protestant tensions in it. These tensions don't manifest themselves as religious anymore, more cultural and political. For instance, within the CDU/CSU you'll find political differences between the Northeast German Merkel (Realpolitik-focused) and the Southeast German S\u00f6der (more traditional conservative). Remember S\u00f6der wanting to install crosses in all Bavarian offices? Of course, it's really just a tinge, and religious affiliation is just one part of the complex, multifaceted network of German politics and identity\n\nIn Hawes's *The Shortest History of Germany*, he broadly splits Germany into three parts: (1) the south and southwest that were Romanized (much of it is Catholic here), (2) the middle strip that was populated by Germanic people who were Christianized mostly around the time of Charlemagne (split Protestant and Catholic), and (3) the northeast that was \"colonized\" in a sense by German people moving east and displacing Slavic people living there (in the past, this area was largely Protestant -- because of the GDR, it is grey). I think this split is a good conceptualization of how religious, political, and cultural divides develop and persist. (Disclaimer: IANA historian)\n\nTLDR: While Catholic-Protestant differences aren't religious fistfights anymore, they can still provide historical context for modern social and political tensions in Germany",

The fact neither the people nor the church officials care today is a modern marvel and indeed a curious thing considering how bad it was in places.

Also, that war was incredibly devastating - it took about 100 years to reach pre-war population again, which is pretty much the reason why Germany wasn't involved in overseas colonialism much.",

You know... Because I'm not religious.\n\nI'm glad I never had to cross that bridge anyway because I would have felt very shady to get baptised just to get married in a church. Like. Dumping me in a pool of water won't make me religious, and I kinda find it disrespectful towards the church if my heathen ass just paid lip service.",

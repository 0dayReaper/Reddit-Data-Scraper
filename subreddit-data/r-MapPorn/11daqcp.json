The only time I ever felt at risk is when I missed a turn and ended up west of the I65 which felt like a whole different city. Birmingham is always ranked as the most dangerous in Alabama but in reality the good and bad parts are completely separate and in the right areas there is almost no risk. Compared to my hometown of mobile it feels much safer. In mobile the good and bad are a lot closer and scattered and the general downtown just feels unsafe. I\u2019ve been to Anniston a few times passing through and it\u2019s always amazed me how a smaller town like that could top those lists when it doesn\u2019t feel unsafe but I guess there must be more to it further off the interstate",

This is about 5% of all gun homicides (19,400) nation-wide.\n\nChicago has about 700 homicides per year, with an assumed 80% being by gun (using the national average) that makes 560 gun homicides. Only about 15 killings are done by police in the entire state. That's less than 3%.\n\n[https://www.statista.com/statistics/585159/people-shot-to-death-by-us-police-by-month/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/585159/people-shot-to-death-by-us-police-by-month/)\n\n[https://news.wttw.com/2023/01/04/chicago-homicides-declined-2022-total-still-among-highest-90s](https://news.wttw.com/2023/01/04/chicago-homicides-declined-2022-total-still-among-highest-90s)\n\n[https://policeepi.uic.edu/illinois-data-on-police-shootings-and-violence/](https://policeepi.uic.edu/illinois-data-on-police-shootings-and-violence/)\n\nFor global context:\n\nAnnual killings by police per capita is far higher in the US than all other developed peer nations with similar crime and poverty rates.\n\nUS: 28.5 / 10 million people\n\nCanada: 9.7, France: 3.8, New Zealand: 2.1, UK: 0.5\n\nNot totally surprising since the US general homicide rate is 7 times higher than the average of those same countries too, driven by a gun homicide rate that is 25 times higher. And a gun ownership rate that is 5 times higher.\n\nUS cops face people armed with guns far more often than anywhere else.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_countries\\_with\\_annual\\_rates\\_and\\_counts\\_for\\_killings\\_by\\_law\\_enforcement\\_officers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_annual_rates_and_counts_for_killings_by_law_enforcement_officers)",

One Friday night coming back from the pub there was a cop car parked to the side and two cops, I don't remember what they were doing but we stopped to chat with them. One of the group asked them about guns and one of the cops looked around him like 5 times to see if the coast was clear and waved us over to the car. In the car was a locked-up rifle and he was telling us that he was one of the cops allowed to have a gun. He was telling us this in a very macho action-hero way. \n\nI just remember kind of laughing as I walked because my home university had a gun vault on campus for student use that had more weapons in it than most police precincts in the UK. \n\nI don't remember all of the particulars because I was drunk and this was over a decade ago.",

The gun locker was a secure gun locker that was controlled by security to store student firearms. It was a way to control access to firearms as they could not be stored on campus except in the vault.

I get where the misconception comes from (the Gendarmerie is part of the military, albeit mostly for historical reasons), but in practice they are effectively the same as the police, just deployed in more rural areas instead. Your average gendarme isn't going to be any more equipped than your average \"Police Nationale\" officer, and both have specific units with heavier equipment.\n\nActual soldiers (as in, members of one of the more traditional military corps, and most often l'Arm\u00e9e de Terre (just the army)) are the ones that patrol in military uniforms as part of the \"plan vigipirate\", as the gendarmes wear a blue uniform more similar to the one worn by the police, as they're functionally policemen.",

In other states, they leave it up to the county. Whether federal agencies allow machine guns is entirely up to the rules governing the agency. \n\nAs far as owning a machine gun, it's very expensive and a bit of a process but it's definitely doable. The first thing is that civilian ownership of machine guns was prohibited in 1986 but it wasn't retroactive, meaning that machine guns registered before 1986 are still legal to own. Thousands of pre-86 machine guns are bought and sold every year, but since no new ones can be produced they're extremely expensive. Once you find one for sale and buy it, you have to apply for a NFA tax stamp and as long as you're not a \"prohibited person\" (convictions, drug user, mental issues, etc) then you get to wait 9-18 months ish, then you get to own a machine gun.",

It was one of the most noticeable things on the street when I was visiting Rome in 2019. It was not at all unusual to see two or more police officers standing on a corner holding rifles. That only really happens in the US if there's some massive event, like the Super Bowl, or if there's a big planned protest, or something. In Italy, it was just a Tuesday. I found it very unnerving, but didn't know about it until I visited.",

It's also pretty obvious that a lot of Americans want to ban \"scary guns\" (e.g. AR-15s) but handguns are off limits even in the minds of a lot of these people because they still want to keep their own handgun.",

Gunshots are loud, so if you put a bunch of microphones in an area, when they all pick up the same gunshot, you can use them ton pinpoint where the gun was fired.\n\nThe math is based on triangulation. It\u2019s effective in determining where the sound occurs, even when accounting for things like building topography and geography. \n\nThe problem is that gunshots are not a distinct sound. A lot of things sound like gunshots to varying degrees. Fireworks, car backfires, a large object being dropped, car crashes, so on so forth. A trained ear may be able to tell the difference 70%-80% of the time, depending on the sound. But because these sounds happen as much or more than gunshots, the 20-30% that is missed can throw off the data wildly.\n\nFireworks and car backfires can be the worst offender. In my city, shotspotter is basically useless during the summer because of an increase in these noises.\n\nOver time, as AI is onboarded and techniques are refined, shotspotter will likely get better. But the past few years, it has not been as effective as advertised. There\u2019s just a lot of false positives that they haven\u2019t been able to cut from the data.",

The murder rate in St. Louis, Missouri is 3x the murder rate in Chicago, but commentators always talk about Chicago.",

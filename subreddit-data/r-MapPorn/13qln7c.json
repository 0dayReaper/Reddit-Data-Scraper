            "comment": "The names \"Nova Ves\" in Czech and Slovak, \"Nowa Wies\" in Polish, and \"Satu Nou\" in Romanian all translate to \"new village\" or \"new town\" in English. These names are quite common across different regions and countries that have a Slavic or Romanian influence.\n\nThe reason for the prevalence of these names is rooted in historical and cultural factors. Throughout history, as new settlements were established or expanded, they were often given names that reflected their \"newness\" or recent founding. This was a way to distinguish them from existing settlements or to mark their development as new population centers.\n\nAs a result, many places with similar names like Nova Ves, Nowa Wies, or Satu Nou emerged in different regions, especially in Central and Eastern Europe where Slavic and Romanian languages are spoken. These names are indicative of the historical patterns of settlement and development in these areas.",

Most places in Transylvania had Hungarian names originally, but got their official names in Romanian after Transylvania became part of the country. In most places it was easy, because many settlements had unofficial Romanian names, used by the Romanian (then) minority. \n\nBut where I live there weren't many Romanians, so the villages had to be renamed. There's a village in my county named \u00dajfalu (New Village) and the authorities named it... Suseni (close to \"Upper village\"). Romania has 39 New Villages, but at the 40th they said no, we won't have any more.",

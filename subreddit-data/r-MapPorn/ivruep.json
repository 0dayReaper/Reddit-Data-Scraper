They're only 0.2\u00b0 away from each other in latitude as well.\n\nI always thought that the PNW climate was quite similar to Scotland - fairly mild, lots of drizzle, but in places they're practically identical. Fewer bears in Scotland maybe.",

If Scotland were reflected along its southern border, the reflection would also comfortably be entirely north of Alaska's southern point - which to be fair is as much a quirk of Alaska as it is Scotland.\n\nScotland's also really far *West.* Edinburgh (the capital city of Scotland, on the east coast) is west of almost every non-scottish city on mainland Britain - including Cardiff, the capital of Wales. It's west of almost all of France, and is only slightly east of Madrid.  Scotland's western-most point shares the same longitude as Casablanca.",

So if you try to pay in cash you just end up lugging massive amounts of notes around (most of them pretty worthless - a 50 tugrik is about 2 cents). If you got paid your salary in cash it would be a massive headache. \n\n\nBank cards aren't used that much - what everyone does is do bank transfers to pay. The mobile banking apps are really good here. You can just scan a QR code to get the correct bank account and transfer across. Even paying in the local corner shop or paying a taxi, I just get their bank details and transfer the correct money. You need to always have some charge in your phone haha but otherwise a very practical system. \n\n\nLogistics - in UB and the aimag capitals there are ATMs everywhere. Elsewhere you might struggle to access cash, but there'll always be a bit of data signal so you can use your phone to pay! \n\n\nI'm not 100% on this but I believe that the government actively encourages people to get bank accounts to enable Mongolian cash to stay in the country and to grow the economy. You can get savings accounts here that pay 30% interest, and it's very easy to get an account. Even as a foreigner I have two bank accounts. \n\n\nHope that was useful!",

Mongolia only left USSR control in the early 90s and I suppose the government had to kind of set everything up from scratch, so it's a bit more streamlined and modern than countries who have been dealing with banking/social security/ taxes etc. for a long time and so have entrenched systems that are quite archaic and clunky (looking at you, Spain...). I remember reading some articles that said the same thing in the 2000s about some African economies that jumped straight from cash to phone banking using mobiles as landlines had never really been installed in the countryside.",

But Mongolia's economy is heavily petrochemical-based so is doing surprisingly well (in terms of GDP), and since the fall of communism its infrastructure has modernized quite rapidly. So even in small far-flung towns of a few thousand people (or less) you will absolutely find ATMs and other modern conveniences.",

It not only harms the common population but also makes the ruling Government not softer, but rather more desperate and ruthless . You think that Hijab fiasco happened last year  only because of the religious nut-jobery of the mullahs????. No, the another reason for emphasis on Hijab and religion in general is that they are seen as a controlling mechanism and is used by the mullahs to distract population from the current economic problems caused partly by the sanctions.\n\nYou are better of invading Iran( really not a joke it would be better) than putting those stupid sanctions and giving such a slow and painful treatment to the populace .\n\nJust 6-7 years back Iran was still more liberal than Saudi Arabia  with churches operating, more liberal social policies and also women able to drive. But now Saudi has become better than Iran at least in many areas. Why??? Because no sanctions on Saudi which has led to a more stable minded ruling of the country. If you had sanctioned Saudi the way you did Iran they too would have went apeshit into all this stuff.  Yes Saudi isn't a liberal paradise but sanctions would have literally made it a lot worse not better.\n\nBeing \"tough\" through sanctions and isolation on a country only makes the country a lot more ballistic.  You either just simply invade it if you badly wanna end the problem or try a better and more accommodating method.",

The US had full control of Iraq in less than 2 weeks, they just could never hold it forever. \n\nIf the US could actually sell itself as a liberator, work with Iranian democratic movements to form a proper government, and then leave behind a stable Iranian democracy, the military invasion isn't completely inconceivable, just very, very hard. That being said, what I just described is not gonna happen. The last time the US \"liberated\" Iran they installed a monarch. There is a bitter resentment of the United States in Iran, and that's unlikely to change any time soon.\n\nThe only thing that might make Iran easier on this front than Iraq or especially Afghanistan is that Iran has a functional civil society already, the US doesn't need to build that. However this is still a really bad idea. \n\nAlso Iran could have nuclear weapons in like 8 seconds and has an ally with a few thousand ballistic missiles so that could also be a problem.",

I realize that each country, each sanction, the power of the countries doing the sanctioning are all different and obviously have different affects.\n\nAs someone who probably agrees with you on a world outlook, I just find it hard to be like we sould sanction/boycott country X (or at the least not condem certain sanctions) but sanctions/emabrgoes/isolation don't work/are evil/ are bad. It just seems super wormy to be like well sanctions are bad but not condem all sanctions because of factor x,y, or z (even if you truly believe that).",

And in light of recent events, they actually seem keen to end their feud with Saudi Arabia. I think the Iranians and the Gulf Arabs are coming to terms and realising that America had been treating them like pieces on a chess board, the board being the Middle East.\n\nNonetheless, in the context of long-term economic growth, I believe the regime did a better job than the all the Shah's ever did. from Qajar to Reza. However, Khomeini was at least five times more brutal than the Shah, and a hundred times more insane. One man was a textbook arrogant tyrant. The other was an unreal death spawn.",

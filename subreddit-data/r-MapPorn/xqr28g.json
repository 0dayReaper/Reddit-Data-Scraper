Perhaps Ortelius was trying to get Scandinavia to \"match up\" with North America? \n\nOr it might just be that the fjords of Norway made it difficult to map. We STILL have issues figuring out how long Norway's coastline is. Or Ortelius just had a poor source map. Those are the 4 most likely reasons I can think of.",

Decide that the top of the paper is north and you're going to draw your map at 1 mile to 1 inch. Using your compass you know that the mountain you can see is directly north-west of you. You know the mountain is 20 miles away, so draw a line on your paper heading north-west 2 inches long. Put a dot on the paper, that's the mountain. Keep on doing this and you'll end up with a pretty accurate map.\n\nOn top of this sailors always made general charts of coastlines showing landmarks and sailing times. They were more like travel guides than accurate maps, but get a hold of enough of them and you could come up with reasonable assumptions about the size and shape of landmasses.\n\nFinally, if you wanted super accuracy you could use trigonometry. Measure a straight line on the ground. Measure the angle to a landmark from each end of the line. You can now calculate the distance from that landmark to each end of the line, giving you a triangle with known angles and side lengths. You can then use the sides of your triangle to build more triangles using the same method. Repeat a few thousand times and you've got a *really* accurate map.",

It was commonly agreed that there must be a gigantic magnetic mountain at the north pole (why else would compasses point there?) and the few travelers and explorers to head that far north reported strong ocean currents heading northwards, which created the idea of a giant whirlpool around the mountain. Then there were some hoaxes/early science fiction - such as the *Inventio Fortunata* - a 14th century account supposedly written by an English monk who traveled to Scandinavia then used 'magic' to explore further - that were accepted as fact because there was basically no way to disprove them.\n\nAll of this was combined in [Mercator's polar map of 1569](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Mercator_north_pole_1595.jpg), which showed four islands surrounding the polar mountain. Mercator's other maps were so brilliant that everyone just accepted that he must have known what he was talking about and his ideas about the arctic were copied onto other maps for decades, including this one.",

Its existence was not based on any survey or direct observation, but rather on the idea that continental land in the Northern Hemisphere should be balanced by land in the Southern Hemisphere. This theory of balancing land has been documented as early as the 5th century on maps by Macrobius, who uses the term Australis on his maps.",

I wonder if there was a debate as to whether to call it Australia. \n\nI read an article that it was named Australia by an Englishman Matthew Flanders who first circumvigated the continent. It had been partially mapped before, but not named Australia. So I'm wondering if there weren't people back in Europe tut-tuting 'that's not *really* Australia'.",

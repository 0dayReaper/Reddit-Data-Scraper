It's not just that millions and millions of people died. It was the destruction of an entire civilization.\n\nPrior to World War Two, a Jew could wake up in Warsaw and head to a Jewish-owned coffeeshop, where he could order and be served in Yiddish. He could then read the Yiddish-language newspaper *Folkstzaytung* published by the Jewish socialist Bund while his friends at the next table read a Yiddish-language Zionist-Marxist newspaper *Arbaytertzaytung*, published by Poalei Zion, and the Hebrew-language weekly newspaper *Ba-Derekh*. They could then debate the relative merits of the candidates standing for election to the Kehilla, the council representing the Jews of Warsaw. He could advocate for a Bundist candidate, and his friends, a Zionist one, but they'd agree that they'd never vote for the Orthodox Agudath Israel. He could then get lunch with his wife and his mother-in-law at a different Jewish-owned restaurant, again to be served in Yiddish, where his mother-in-law could excitedly talk about the man and his wife's upcoming trip to Lozisht, the shtetl in eastern Poland where the mother-in-law had grown up and where her family still lived. After lunch, he could go to a meeting of the socialist Bund (under indiscreet surveillance by the anti-Communist government) while his wife led a meeting of her Jewish women's philanthropic group. That evening, the man and his wife could attend a play at the Warsaw Yiddish Arts Theater, and afterward, get in a fight about whether they thought the actors were being sufficiently well-represented by the Polish Yiddish Actors' Union.\n\nAfter the Holocaust, every single part of that experience is gone. The Jewish-owned coffeeshops--gone. The Yiddish-language newspapers--gone. The Hebrew-language newspapers--gone. The Jewish council (the Kehilla)--gone. The Zionist, Bundist, and Orthodox political parties running in the Kehilla--gone. The entire village of Lozisht--gone. The Bund and its thousands of members--gone. The Yiddish theatre scene in Poland--gone. The Jewish-specific professional organizations--gone.\n\nEverything, every part of Jewish civil society between Paris and Moscow, was just... gone. The groups that were not entirely killed did not have the people to continue in any meaningful way. What is a Yiddish-language theatre troupe of one person? Why print a Yiddish-language newspaper for 100 surviving Jews in a city of hundreds of thousands?",

There are multiple examples of Jews being treated well for a few generations - sometimes even for quite long periods of time - but then all it takes is one generation where some reactionary populist scapegoats all Jewish people for economic problems/changes in culture or society/military defeat etc etc for everything to change.\n\nRight now America is generally safe for Jews outside of some small but notable pockets of anti-Semitic extremism. But will it be that way in 60 years, or 200 years, or 500 years? Who knows, but that safety is entirely dependent on the non-Jewish community and there is literally mountains of historical precedent for that safety being conditional and not unequivocal.\n\nIsrael isn\u2019t necessarily safe right now, but from speaking to a number of Jewish people about it it seems as though many view migration to Israel as a generational investment, somewhere where their safety does not rely on other people.",

The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was one of the most powerful states in Europe for parts of the Middle Ages, and it was also remarkably tolerant for its time, welcoming in Jewish communities and giving them far more rights than they could expect in other contemporary European Kingdoms.  \n\nThese attitudes began to change as the Commonwealth was carved up by Russia, Prussia, Austria, and Sweden in the 1700s, and \u201cPolishness\u201d could no longer be defined by nationality (since the nation had collapsed) and instead became based in shared Catholic tradition.  But the initial tolerance of the Commonwealth was the entire reason that there was such a comparatively large Jewish population in Eastern Europe by the time of World War II.",

The US being what it is, you will get people who have one Jewish parent and one non-Jewish parent, who celebrate both Easter with one half of the family and Passover with the other. Do you count that person as Jewish or not?

The idea that religion is separate from culture, tribe, nation etc is a concept that came with Christianity as a global universal religion. Jews and Hindus didn't originally think like that. They originated at a time when these concepts overlapped. So using a binary religion vs culture won't capture what those groups are and will lead to misunderstandings.",

It reminds me of a line from the poem Todesfuge (Fugue of Death) by the Romanian-born Jewish poet (but writing in German - even after the War - since it was an important cultural language in eastern Europe) Paul Celan: \"Der Tod ist ein Meister aus Deutschland\", or in English \"Death is a master from Germany\" (think of \"master\" here not in the sense of a master and his slaves, but as in a master's degree). \n\nIt's a chilling poem, especially when you hear it read aloud. [Here](https://frankwatsonpoet.com/death-fugue-translation-of-paul-celans/) is a translation into English with the original German poem under it, and [here](https://youtu.be/gVwLqEHDCQE) is the poet reading it himself. Even if you don't understand German, hearing the monotonous voice, the steady cadence, the unrelenting droning on of his voice marching on through the destruction, is absolutely chilling.",

They were able to get the Jews out of Europe. My grandfather was born in Poland and the Holocaust started when he was 11. His father was killed, neighbors turned on the Jews and he was separated from his brother and mother. Eventually he escaped to the USSR and lived in Siberia for the remainder of the war, but when the war was over and he returned to Poland, he had to leave. How could you stay in a place where people from your community either were killed or turned on you? He was given a choice to remain in Poland or go to Israel (Palestine at the time) and he chose the latter, eventually ending up in the US. Being Jewish used to almost be synonymous with Europe since around the 1500s, and now, we really only exist in the US and Israel. \n\nYes, 6 million+ Jews were killed on paper, but many people forget the larger mass exodus that followed, robbing Jews of their European histories. My grandfather was proud of his Polish heritage, and it saddened me he could not imagine returning to his home country, where his father was buried and where he grew up. For him and many others, Hitler left such a stain, that he would rather start a life in a new country than return home. \n\nI really hope one day we can all live in harmony, coexist, and not commit horrible atrocities against our fellow man. Hopefully we have learned from our past mistakes.\n\nEdit: I just wanted to clarify that following the conclusion of the war, he *did* return to Poland, only to leave for Israel about a month later.",

Homelessness was rampant. In December 1945, the authorities introduced a forced housing economy, they would forcefuy install families in home-owners homes, who suddenly had to live with strangers. Your grandpa's situation wasn't unique and I honestly doubt it had anything to do with antisemitism.\n\n\n&gt;The extent of interference (e.g., the size of apartments to which families were quartered, or the desired number of people in an apartment) depended on the decision of the specific national council. It usually applied to apartments with more than 5 rooms. The most common rule was that there could be no more than 1 room per person. Additional tenants were therefore added to larger apartments. They had one or more rooms to themselves, along with the right to use the kitchen and bathroom. This was often a way to humiliate people who were wealthy or unruly in the face of the new communist government. Assignments were made without agreement with the owner of the apartment, to which additional people were quartered. After 1956, this method of docking was abandoned.\n\n&gt;Another element of housing management was the housing policy in private tenements. Some of them were nationalized, but some were left in private hands. Tenants, however, were rehoused on the basis of a lodging decision, without agreement with the property owner. Tenants paid official rates for rent, which did not cover the actual costs of using the premises and repairing the buildings. For this reason, private tenements often fell into disrepair.\n\n[source](https://pl.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospodarka_mieszkaniowa_w_PRL)",

Instead of fixed gas chambers they used car exhausts and mass shootings, the more permanent camps (Treblinka, Auschwitz and Kulmhof) were definitely operating until the last possible moment. Not to speak of the labor/detention camps which grew deadlier the later in the war it was (Buchenwald, Mauthausen, Sachsenhausen, etc).",

She was a one of many brothers and sisters in a large extended family.\nTired of fleeing and hiding from Russian pogroms, my GG and one of her little brothers decided to flee.\nSo in the early 1900s, my GG hid on a boat and moved to the Lower East Side(cliche, I know) and my great great uncle moved deeper into Russia and joined one of the many revolutionary groups active at the time(which in this era was also pretty cliche). They managed to stay in touch even during the height of the Cold War, and both lived into their 90s before dying peacefully.\n\nIf one looks up the location of their birthplace on Google Maps, they would just find a satellite image of an empty field. And underneath that field is where the ruins of that shtetl and all its inhabitants lay, courtesy of the the einsatzgruppen.\n\nDespite being scattered to the four winds, that part of the world was still considered the spiritual and cultural heart of the Ashkenazim.  A place of study and tradition lost to time.  A place where the locals tried to ignore the outside world, hoping the outside world would return the favor. They kept hoping until it was too late.\n\nMaps like this are IMPORTANT. People need to see the numbers in stark contrast like this. But its also is important to remember the damage went beyond the bodies. The Nazis tore out the heart of the Ashkenazim, and left scars so deep we descendants were born with them.\n\nEven those who made it to the end of the war didn't truly and fully survive. They had been thrust into deepest horrors of modern war, and found themselves not knowing who could be trusted. Could they ever be trusted. They could never 'go back home\".\nEven if by some miracle where they left was still standing it could never be home again.\n\nThe damage was done, and it resonates its awful sound in our collective and individual souls to this day\u05e1\n\nThis is also why if you see or hear anyone flippantly compare themselves to Holocaust victims for a personal and political agenda, you owe it to the living and the dead to firmly tell them to go fuck themselves in every way possible for the sake of the dead and all those who managed to half-survive.\n\nIf you've read this far, thank you for your patience and understanding, and hopefully came across as more than a sad and incoherent diatribe.",

                                            "comment": "Yeah, it seems Poland's Jewish population rose after the black death and possibly because of it, as other nations blamed Jews for the black death, so massacres all over started taking place.  \n\nOkay this was a wild read.  It somehow starts with Jews not using common wells, involves a lot of killings and burning Jews alive, even a Pope trying to stop the massacres and ends with a huge amount of Jews fleeing to Poland after their King offered refuge to them. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Jews_during_the_Black_Death\n\n&gt;Jews were frequently used as scapegoats and false accusations which stated that they had caused the disease by deliberately poisoning wells were circulated. That is likely because they were less affected than the other people since many Jews chose not to use the common wells which were located in towns and cities. Additionally, Jews were sometimes coerced to confess to poisoning wells through torture.\n\n&gt;The first massacre directly related to the plague took place in April 1348 in Toulon, where the Jewish quarter was sacked, and forty Jews were murdered in their homes. Shortly afterward, violence broke out in Barcelona and other Catalan cities. In 1349, massacres and persecutions spread across Europe, including the Erfurt massacre, the Zurich massacre, the Basel massacre and massacres in Aragon and Flanders. Around 2,000 Jews were burnt alive on 14 February 1349 in the \"Valentine's Day\" Strasbourg massacre, where the plague had not yet affected the city. While the ashes smouldered, Christian residents of Strasbourg sifted through and collected the valuable possessions of Jews that were not burnt by the fires.  The following September, 330 Jews were burned alive in the Kyburg Castle, east of Zurich. Many hundreds of Jewish communities were destroyed in this period. Within the 510 Jewish communities destroyed in this period, some members killed themselves to avoid the persecutions.\n\n&gt;In the spring of 1349, the Jewish community in Frankfurt am Main was annihilated. That was followed by the destruction of Jewish communities in Mainz and Cologne. The 3,000-strong Jewish population of Mainz initially defended themselves and managed to hold off the Christian attackers. However, the Christians managed to overwhelm the Jewish ghetto in the end and killed all of its Jews.\n\n&gt;At Speyer, Jewish corpses were disposed in wine casks and cast into the Rhine. By late 1349, the worst of the pogroms had ended in Rhineland. However, the massacres of Jews was starting to rise near the Hansa townships of the Baltic coast and in Eastern Europe. By 1351, there had been 350 incidents of anti-Jewish pogroms, and 60 major and 150 minor Jewish communities had been exterminated.\n\n&gt;In many cities, the civil authorities either did little to protect the Jewish communities or they actually abetted the rioters.\n\n&gt;The official policy of the Church, which was reasoned in part because Jesus was Jewish, was to protect Jews. In practice, however, Jews were frequently the targets of Christian loathing. As the plague swept across Europe in the mid-14th century and annihilated nearly half the population, people had little scientific understanding of disease and were looking for an explanation.\n\n&gt;The attacks led to the eastward movement of Northern European Jewry to Poland and Lithuania, where they remained for the six centuries. King Casimir III of Poland enthusiastically gave refuge and protection to the Jews. That is consistent with his previous edicts toward Jews. On 9 October 1334, Casimir had confirmed the privileges granted to Jews in 1264 by Boles\u0142aw V the Chaste. Under penalty of death, he prohibited the kidnapping of Jewish children for the purpose of enforced Christian baptism, and he inflicted heavy punishment for the desecration of Jewish cemeteries. The king was therefore already well-disposed to Jews. He was also interested in tapping the economic potential of the Jews.\n\n&gt;Pope Clement VI tried to protect the Jewish communities by issuing two papal bulls in 1348, on 6 July and 26 September. They stated that those who blamed the plague on the Jews had been \"seduced by that liar, the Devil\". He urged clergy to take action to protect Jews and offered them papal protection in the city of Avignon. Clement was aided by the research of his personal physician, Guy de Chauliac, who argued from his own treatment of the infected that the Jews were not to blame.\n\n&gt;Clement's efforts were in part undone by the newly-elected Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, who made property of Jews killed in riots forfeit and gave local authorities a financial incentive to turn a blind eye.\n\n&gt;The influence of Clement VI and of the Church over much of Western Europe proved limited and so many of their attempts to protect Jews were futile. However, this was not the case in regions in which the Pope had considerably more influence; for example, in Avignon, the Pope saved many Jewish lives.\n\n&gt;As the plague waned in 1350, so did the violence against Jewish communities. In 1351, the plague and the immediate persecution was over, though the background level of persecution and discrimination remained. \n\n&gt;One of the most significant long-term consequences of the Black Death in Europe was the migration of the Jews to Poland. The Jews migrated to Poland in an attempt to escape from the persecution which they were being subjected to in Western Europe. This event is one of the major factors that contributed to the existence of a large population of Jews in Poland during the early 20th century. Approximately 3.5 million Jews lived in Poland at the time of Adolf Hitler's rise to power.",

Precedent matters in voting decisions.\n\nEdit: Found an additional explanation for Moldova's vote. In 2018, Cuba voted against a [resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_status_of_Transnistria#United_Nations_Resolution_A%2F72%2FL.58) sponsored by Moldova which called for the removal of all foreign troops from Moldova (read: Russian troops in Trasnistria, Moldova's breakaway region). Since then, Moldova seems to have stopped voting in favor of the yearly resolution calling for the end of the embargo on Cuba.",

The scope of the UNGA is to act as a forum of countries, not as a global legislator. The enforcing within the UN is carried out by the Security Council, whose decisions are binding and where the US and four other countries have veto power. The point of a resolution like this is to show the consensus around such an issue and put pressure on the United States. And besides the \"political\" part of the UN (General Assembly and Security Council), the UN (the organization) carries many useful tasks worldwide in a relatively independent way with the funds granted by the \"political\" UN, such as peacekeeping, food and refugee relief, natural crisis management, development programmes, etc.\n\nEdit: so no, \"the UN\" as a whole is not \"just an opinion poll\".",

The League of Nations was what you're looking for - a world body that could make binding votes that forced it's members to comply.  Except it didn't, because nobody was willing to go to actual war to enforce them, so they were ignored.  The UN, therefore, was set up to recognize the realities of international politics, and not try to be something it wasn't.  Particularly in a world where some countries have nuclear arsenals, nobody can force the major powers to do anything.  What you can do is embarrass them, and bake it plainly obvious when they're out of step with a worldwide consensus.\n\nIs this just an opinion poll?  No, it's more than that.  It's still less than a binding vote, but continued US defiance of such a clear and unified result damages the US's reputation much more than a mere opinion poll would.",

It has the Russian backed separatist state of Transnistria to its eastern part, which historically before WW2 was part of Russia/Ukraine(under Russian rule) so it had Russian population. \n\nIn the past Moldova was either a buffer state between bigger powers like Poland, the Ottomans and Russia, but by the 20th century its modern territory had become part of Russia, though before the part of greater Moldavia that was independent was instrumental in forming Romania, when the Moldavian and Wallachian kingdoms were united into Romania through a little legal loophole. After WW1, Russian collapse allowed for Romania to seize modern day Moldova region. During WW2 USSR first annexed modern Moldavian area, then Romania reconquered it as part of German led invasion of the USSR, before they lost and Romania was forced to cede Moldavia for good, and during the collapse of the USSR Moldova declared independence. \n\nTheir main geopolitical conflict is between whether to align with the west(Europe) or east (Russia), which has been dominated by corrupt Russian aligned politicians, who have done their part in keeping Moldova poor through corruption. However recently it turned towards the EU with the election of the new president and gains in parliament for her party. However their path towards the EU is going to be really difficult, with no talks having been even started as of yet. Another prospect that could be possible would be basically reunification with Romania, though it's likely that the chance for that was lost in the 1990s with the Transnistrian uprising, and today prospects of Moldavian unification with Romania are kinda slim as there is not much drive for it as the wealth disparity between Romania and Moldova is quite dire with poor Romania having developed more than Moldova. \n\nBaically, there is a struggle between Western and Russian influence, with the balance turning in favor of the West recently. However Transnistria is the greatest point of geopolitical importance for the Moldavian state, and as such I would guess the non vote is Moldova trying to placate the US government along with exercising what power they have to show off to the Russians. I would not be surprised if it is in part a vote in favor of the US, so they would be more willing to sell arms.",

Imperial Russia sliced off the part it wanted and called it Bessarabia back in the 19th century when Moldova was under Ottoman suzerainty. This is back when Russia was claiming to be the protector of all Orthodox Christians, and (I think) right before France and Britain got sick of her shit. \n\nAnyway, no one ever thought Moldova (the Bessarabian part) was ever legitimately part of Russia, except the Russians of course. Post WWI, it all got folded into Romania proper, before Romania picked the wrong side (though the only side it could have) in WWII and it got sliced off again by the Red Army. Add a little ethnic cleansing and a lot of settlement of ethnic Russians and there you have it.",

It's hard to claim that North Korea, say, is a rogue state when you're the one who is on the end of more 180-1 votes (or 180-2 votes in the case of some Israel-related votes) than anyone else and you only get away with it due to a security council veto.\n\n&gt; Id rather see it as an initiative from the country itself, to appease the US\n\nIf this is driven by the countries themselves, why is there always just one or two 'appease the US' votes and not lots? Plenty of countries might have some reason to do the US a favour - but only about ~1-4 pick the Cuba vote to abstain/vote against every year. It's because the US has other favours it might need - either other GA votes, or other types of quid pro quos. The vote pattern only makes sense if it's driven by the USA's needs.\n\n(Israel is a constant exception in these kinds of votes, but it's a special case).",

It makes no sense to allow a dictator from Turkmenistan or the King of Bhutan to dictate the foreign policy of The United States. Nor does Turkmenistan want USA to dictate the way Turkmenistan is run.\n\nThe United Nations is a forum. It's a place to get the general opinion of various nations so everything is laid out on the table and out in the open. It's to prevent cloak and dagger diplomacy which led to the interlocking alliances that caused WWI to spiral out of control. We have the UN so we know where everyone stands, so that everyone can make more informed decisions. That way there's no, \"oh I declared war on this guy, but didn't know he has defense agreements with this other guy, and that guy has defense agreements with 3 other guys.\"\n\nIt's also a 'neutral ground' for warring countries to negotiate peace. For example if Iran and Iraq are in open conflict, and can't agree to meet on either country's soil, then you can use the UN facilities as a place to meet and talk.\n\nIt's a diplomatic tool, not a world government. Any attempts at making it a world government are laughable.",

If the UN votes on something and a major world power votes against it but the measure passes, they're just going to ignore the UN, which the UN doesn't want to happen since that means the UN isn't working, so they give major world powers veto power on anything the UN does, meaning China, the US, Russia, the UK, etc. all have to agree on a measure before the UN passes it, along with any other countries in the security council at the time to represent the interests of countries that aren't global superpowers.\n\nThe UN doesn't actually have that much power to do anything either by design",

The U.N. vote can carry political weight, but only the U.S. Congress can lift the more than 50-year-old embargo.\n\n&gt;Biden vowed during his campaign to reverse some of Trump's Cuba measures that \"have inflicted harm on the Cuban people and done nothing to advance democracy and human rights.\" But he has yet to make good on that pledge and his administration has said a shift in policy toward Cuba is not among its top priorities.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-continues-vote-against-un-call-end-cuba-embargo-2021-06-23/",

It's got a long history of working when a major power wants to open up trade with a much smaller, closed-off nation. Gunboat diplomacy doesn't work so well against the world's strongest navy though.",

Which is what votes like this are for. Instead of every country telling the US individually that it thinks the embargo is wrong, they table a vote like this. The expectation isnt to change anything per se, its so the US can clearly see how much support it has and who from.\n\nAnd while the vast majority of countries dont support the embargo, its not a red line issue for any of them and the US being a superpower means that it isnt as vulnerable to outside interference as other countries.\n\n So if this was a slightly different scenario. Say one of the US' closest allies REALLY wanted the US to break the Embargo, say The UK, for example. If the UK really cared it could put additional political pressure on the US to lift the Embargo, and if the US is able to see that no one else support it because of this vote then it changes the balance that US diplomats have to make in their mind. Is the embargo worth the loss of good will from the UK and others. \n\nOr if they were a smaller country, then the repercussions from the embargo would have a much greater impact on them, and they might not be able to shrug it off and seeing this vote would be a lot more likely to change its mind.\n\n\n\nPeople like to focus and what the UN *cant* do because it has to respect the sovereignty of its composite nations. But they dont focus on what the alternative would be without it.",

Actually, for a while our countries actually had pretty tense relations, with America imposing a weapons embargo on Israel. If America stopped being useful to Israel, she would seek new allies.\n\nTo me it seems that Israel desires strong ties to the east than to the west (particularly Muslim nations), given that they gave the entire Sinai peninsula for the sole purpose of recognition from Egypt.  It's also why they have refused to recognize the Armenian genocide, as this would jeopardize relations with Turkey.",

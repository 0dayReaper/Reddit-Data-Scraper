To summarize a little, the migrants live often near the biggest cities like Paris or Marseilles and are not very separated. France is a big destination for immigrants since a lot of years people from an origin tend to unify themselves. For example if you comes from Algeria and already know somebody in France you will try to join him, because he already knows the French system and you are less lost (Montreuil is known as the second city with the most Malian in the world after Bamako). With the time some cities lost their \"old french\" people (not in term of nationality because a lot of the immigrant get the French nationality but in terms of culture). That means that they have an other way to see the world for example about the la\u00efcit\u00e9. (It is normal that the values of country evolves btw).\n\nMoreover as the immigrant tends to have difficulty to find a job, a good salary... It is a vicious circle and their children in particular don't dream about France but more about the country of their parents. (This is my point of view, I might be wrong. But at the end of the 19th century the Third French Republic tried very hard to uniformize the \"typical french person\". That means that they try to erase local identity and today only few people can speak the dialect of their region (for example basque, breton...) and therefore ethnical statistics are very regulated (you are french or not, we don't care if you are black or have another nationality). But today with American movies/culture, and the variety of identical fight (LGBT, BLM,...) The difference is seen as a strength and it enters in contradiction with the old vision of education that France has in mind =&gt; french society is divided between the new generation (they are here so we have to adapt and change some of the rules because they want it. If I remember well 10% of the population is muslim) and the old schooled one (they are in France so they need to adopt the French package)).\n\nTLDR : France has definitely an integration problem, and as 2nd and 3rd generation are not well integrated they are more attached to their culture of heart (the one of their parents/grand parents). I am not 100% about the 1st generation yet.",

Old generation wear scarf, but younger ones wear hijabs. \n\nThere is a real issue with the lack of assimilation and cultural integration of ethnic minorities. A real struggle. While it should be considered quite normal to expect people to conform to French culture and values when moving to France, the left is pretending that it's opposing diversity, and oppressing.\n\nI find quite interesting the study of how far-far-right candidate Eric Zemmour became a game-changer during the last presidential election. While the man is 100% a racist piece of shit, it's his fan-base that is quite intriguing. Because you see, he is himself from an ethnic minority, descended from North-African immigrants. Yet he stole points from blue-eyed blond-hairs Marine Le Pen, also far-right, so much so that in the polls he reached 17% of all French voters. Eventually strategic voting led to him only having 7% during the election. \n\nThis exemple is fascinating because it shows that contrary to what the left keep saying, the far-right is not only made up of racists, but rather of people demanding more assimilation of migrants. Proof is, they were fine making an assimilated (but still POS) immigrant the president!",

Where there would be greyzones for example would be asking it to be taken off for an ID picture. From my observation I've never seen it be an issue for a hijab, since those go around the head.\n\nBasically there are two scenarios for a burqa ban.\nBan the burqa specifically because we hate the Muslims. \n\nNo way that survives.\n\nBan headcoverings in certain contexts for public safety reasons.\n\nMaybe, depends on details.\n\nSo like always, the devil is in the details. For example, if the law is written religiously neutrally but they only target a certain religion, and not another, a court would throw it out because they aren't that stupid.\n\nThere is also two types of challenges. A facial challenge, such that its always unconstitutional, and an as applied challenge, such that its unconstitutional as to certain cases. Depending on the degree of unconstitutionalness, a judge may just delete the unconstitutional part, throw it all out, or perhaps modify the law to be constitutional.\n\nAs an example of the last part would be a ban on all religious clothing, neutral on paper could be modified to be just public places.\n\nThat being said... There is the \"free exercise\" clause, and its possible that a judge will say that its a violation of it. Hypothetically almost all restrictions could be unconstitutional for that reason. In fact, the idea that a particular law targets a particular religion would be free exercise violation is clear enough. Its also possible even a poorly written general law could violate free exercise.",

The rationale is rather that this restriction is justified in order to combat the abuse that is sadly widespread in some migrant communities. Full facial covering is not required by the Quran, by the way, as the Al-Azhar Al-Sharif has repeatedly stated.",

                    "comment": "You can never confirm that it's the person's own choice and in practice many muslim communities can be very strict and conservative, what people like to call cult-like. At least somewhat isolating members from the outside world, indoctrinating members, expecting them to conform or ostracizing them even from family, etc. It does not help that the Saudis spend absurd amounts of money on sponsoring Wahhabi (radical Islamist) mosques around the world.\n\nIt's a nice _philosophy_ to say it's fine if they are adults who have made a conscious personal choice, but that's not an implementable policy. What you can do is allow it, and thus allow another manifestation of cult-like oppression, or you can ban it in at least some contexts in the hope that at least such in-group oppression can never be total, even if this inconveniences some people.\n\nOne such policy is banning them in schools. The reality is that any young girl wearing it to school did not make a choice. Her parents made her wear it. We all know this. If her parents make her wear it, they do that everywhere, school, shopping, whatever. If you ban it in schools, you give her one experience in life where that control does not extend, where she can be just like all the other kids. School being a significant part of a young girl's life means that someone who does have to wear it will thus have a lot of time in her life where she does wear it (outside school) and a lot of time where she does not wear it (in school). It stands to reason that following that kind of childhood it's much more likely that this girl will consider it and make an informed choice about what she wants to do as an adult, than if she has basically never had the opportunity to live a day without it.\n\nOther bans might be things like not being able to wear it in a government office, such as was the case in Turkey to my understanding. This again carries its probably intentional lesson, that of differing expectations. You go to the mosque, you put on a headscarf, you go to renew your passport, you take it off. The more important thing is, in this case neither control is absolute and all-encompassing, and you also have a free space in between, your own free time, where you choose what you do. In this case you're still putting in a headscarf when going to a mosque and respecting the traditions of the religion in doing so, but you're also respecting other rules, your house your rules, their house their rules.\n\nWhether any of these policies is desirable is a matter of opinion, but what must be realised is that platitudes like \"if she wants to its ok\" are meaningless for policymaking and no policy will ever fulfill that being the case, at least unless muslims themselves voluntarily drop all pressure on women to dress a certain way.",

Also I'm not an expert, so perhaps you'll get a more informed response.\n\nAnyway, my understanding is that it's usually some combination of 1) anti-Islam sentiment 2) protecting women from being forced into conservative dress by friends/family/community 3) security concerns.\n\nThe first will generally not be said out loud but is arguably the biggest factor. The sentiment can come from the top or be grassroots. The second is a friendly way to sell it to decent, liberal minded folks. It can be felt quite sincerely, but sometimes it's little more than a fig leaf to cover the first motivation. The third is how it's justified in terms of pragmatic policy. And again, for some it is a sincere concern, but it's definitely used disingenuously for cover as well. The basic idea being that it can be used to evade surveillance.\n\nI'm personally in favor of such bans, but it's definitely a tricky matter.\n\nEdit: Somehow neglected to mention that it's often framed as anti-Islamic extremism, as opposed to just anti-Islam.",

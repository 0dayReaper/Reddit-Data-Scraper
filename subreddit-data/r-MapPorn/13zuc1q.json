At the same time this was mainly with other developed nations such as Canada or the UK. Last time I checked America had huge amounts of wealth before the 1970s so the whole base of this argument without even examining the crevasses of it just by looking at the circumstances is defeated.",

I definitely didn't have wealthy parents, and only could get a house or go to college because I got a military scholarship and a VA loan, but now I'm in an excellent position because I lived below my means and took advantage of the opportunities the military afforded. There's plenty of upward mobility opportunities like that out there, even if they sacrifice some short term comfort for long term stability.",

Really, it should include many other people globally, at least to some extent, because many of these companies are global, and rely on global supply chains, but still.*\n\nThis is broadly corroborated by other results if you Google it.

That's a fully armed carrier plus destroyer bodyguards, nuke subs, and logistics/supply teams. \n\nThe US likes to drop brass balls on the table and park carrier battle groups off the coast of middle eastern countries.\n\nThe entire oceans shipping is patrolled by US fleets, with US Naval bases found all over the world.\n\nIncluding those Naval bases, the US has 800 foreign military bases around the world.\n\nThe US is the only global superpower, in the sense that it has the largest, most advanced military in the world, and it can project that force to any part of the world  with no delay.\n\nThere is a reason the EU doesn't spend that much on defense. The Western Hegemony has determined that the US will be their equivalent of Sparta.\n\nNot saying it's good or bad, but it's a serious fucking force that has no global equal.",

            "comment": "They do merit scholarships based on artistic abilities (ask about arts merits scholars of applicable) or if you're recruited for varsity athletics. Otherwise all scholarships are strictly need-based. Outside of Bucknell, though, I highly recommend searching around for miscellaneous scholarships from private benefactors. There's all sorts of random stuff people will give you money for (major-related, left-handedness, demographic-based, the list goes on). Best of luck and I hope it works out! Bucknell gave me an incredible 4 years",

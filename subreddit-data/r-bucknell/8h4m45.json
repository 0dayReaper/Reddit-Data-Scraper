    "postText": "So I am considering applying to bucknell for next year but I am not sure about how social life is there.  Honestly I am not really into parties and drinking (I do enjoy it, but only once in a while), as I rather focus on other activities like sports or excersice. Is it a good idea for me to apply to a school with lots of drinking/parties such as Bucknell? Besides this, how would you describe social life at Bucknell?",

I can't say for certain, but I really think that's how most schools are. As for sports/exercise there are a lot of club sport teams, intramurals, and the athletic facility is really nice with lots of options. You can find things to do you'll just have to be more proactive about it.",

            "comment": "I think the 60% Greek stat is misleading. You can't rush until you're a sophomore, so if you take the freshmen out of the equation that's a MUCH higher percentage of greek members. \n\nI took this gamble when I went to Bucknell because I didn't like drinking or partying either. Ended up joining a sorority because there really isn't much else to do (and hated the sorority). I was a member of a couple of non-drinking clubs but it's just not enough to fill up four years.\n\nI would recommend applying elsewhere. Bucknell is fantastic for many things but if you can't get behind the Greek culture it's likely to disappoint you. I wish I'd realized just how much the party scene controlled the entire experience before I committed.",

    "postText": "OK, this is a longshot but I went to Bucknell 2001-2005. In 2004 or 2005 I took a sculpture class and constructed a rather large cement, abstract, layered, geometrical statue. It's sort of pyramid shaped. I left to study abroad and then never returned to see the completed piece. Has anyone seen this statue? Who knows, they might have just destroyed it after I left. It would have weighed, probably over 1000 lbs. so maybe they just left it in the art studio building? I'd love to see a pic if it's still there. Thanks.",

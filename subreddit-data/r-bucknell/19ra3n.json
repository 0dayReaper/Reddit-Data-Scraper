Can't be, because I smell this stuff in the dead of winter. A while back when I used to live in McDonnell Hall, I'd go do my laundry and when walking back to my room, the smell would smack me in the face because of the sharp contrast of detergent to horse crap. I know I can't be the only one. Someone back me up here.\n\nNote: This is merely an observation. I love Bucknell.",

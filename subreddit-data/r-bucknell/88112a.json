The department is incredible, with a lot of special attention paid to majors and lots of good research opportunities. Exceptional faculty, private student lounge for majors, and a curriculum that outclasses the range of courses most universities offer. Highly recommend.",

I know a lot of people that took this class and either decided to switch to a full time physics major or double major because the department is that awesome.  You really can't go wrong with Bucknell physics. They have a way of making students see the awesomeness that is this branch of science. ",

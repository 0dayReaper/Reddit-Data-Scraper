    "postText": "Athletics made the unfortunate decision this week to suspend the pep band from the remainder of Basketball season, including travel to the NCAA tournament or NIT tournament for both Men and Women's teams.  They are seeking an outside band to perform at any remaining games rather than supporting their own entirely volunteer based band.\n\nThis is unacceptable given that the band is 100% volunteer and receives 0 support from the athletics department.  The band isn't part of the music department or any other on the academic side but it squarely the responsibility of Athletics.\n\nI encourage everyone to write to John Hardt (AD) and President Bravman in support of the band.",

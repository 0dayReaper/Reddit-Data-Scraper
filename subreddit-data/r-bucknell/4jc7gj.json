    "postText": "I am a high school senior and I need to choose what college I will be going to ASAP. I got into a few but I've cut it down to these two schools. Below is a pros and cons list of each. Does anyone have anything else they would suggest I take into account for Bucknell? Or an opinion on which I should enroll in? Any advice is great.\n\nBucknell:\n\nPros\n-More fun (parties)\n-Liberal Arts which means smaller classrooms with more discussion based learning. I have ADD so I would benefit from this over classes that are just lectures.\n-Nicer weather\n-Smaller school\n-Hotter girls\n-Harder to get into\n-Graduates of Bucknell get higher paying jobs on average than Binghamtion graduates. \n\nCons\n-I would graduate with 40k in debt which I would have to pay off myself\n-Greek life is super big there (like 2/3 of students join). I would probably still rush.\n-The public transportation isn't great\n\nBinghamton:\n\nPros\n-Better options for undergrad research and internships\n-I wouldn't have to pay anything and would have leftover money for grad school\n-Better housing\n-Free buses from the college to the city of Binghamton that run often\n\nCons\n-not as fun as Bucknell\n-A lot of kids from my high school are going\n-Big\n-According to a lot of people it's very easy. I'd prefer a more challenging school.\n",

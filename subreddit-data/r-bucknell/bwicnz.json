I met one person in the program who I consider to be one of my best friends, but she also lived in the same hall as me. Idk if I would do it again because I'm a Creative Writer and the program was very performing arts oriented the year that I participated \n\nA lot of people love BuckWild and stay friends with their BuckWild \"groups\" \n\nI really don't think it's something you need to worry too deeply about.",

Some time to make connections, especially with upperclassmen, before classes start is really nice. \n\nI\u2019d encourage you to do pre-o, regardless of the program!",

I also was a buckwild leader for 3 years and my kiddies all seemed to like it 3 of them joined buckwild as leaders themselves. You can ask the leaders anything about Bucknell and they'll either answer it or know another leader who can answer the question.\n\n And it only improved since I did it. 1 thing, you get to move in early so chances are you get to choose which bed you want and set up the room the way you'd like it before any roommates show up. \n\nyou'll make some friends early and especially you'll meet some upperclassman who can help you get booze and get into some parties.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things it doesn't really matter if you do pre-orientation or not its what you want. Personally I'm not the most outgoing person so I knew that I would struggle making friends through orientation. with buckwild i had a group of people, some of which weren't my greatest of friends and we drifted apart halfway through the year, but for the early weeks it was nice for me to have that group that i could talk to",

I.e., I suspect you might be curious about the social life, making connections, etc, and everyone I know seemed to enjoy buck wild. I never heard a bad thing about it, only positive but not that as though it was a huge deal. Kind of a nice to have but very nice to have for the right person.",

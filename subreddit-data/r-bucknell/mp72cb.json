    "postText": "Im on the Wait List for 2025 for the college of management and i really want to go to bucknell. should i add arts and sciences as my second choice in case no spots open up in the college of management? Would I be able to get something close enough to a business education if i were to do Econ in arts and sciences and then just a minor in Management? How difficult is the workload of econ in arts and sciences vs any of the majors in the college of management (is econ more math heavy)?",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm a current high school junior working on my college list, and I'm considering Bucknell because of its strong engineering program and research opportunities. Though my career goal is to become a physician, I am interested in the hands-on, problem-solving approach of engineering. I would also like a fallback if I decide that med school isn't for me. Is premed with an engineering major (specifically ChemE) feasible here at Bucknell? Could any students in this path share their experience?",

There would be plenty of overlap, but between class, and labs for many of classes in both Bio and ChemE, you'd have to be extremely diligent and have a lot of self-discipline to manage all of that. \n\nBest of luck! Bucknell would be lucky to have someone that determined!",

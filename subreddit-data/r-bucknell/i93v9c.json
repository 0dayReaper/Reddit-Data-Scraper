I'm a freelance journalist working on a story about going back to college amid a pandemic and was wondering if anyone would be willing to speak with me about the experience you've had on campus so far. My dms are open and I can protect your identity. Feel free to ping me with questions as well.\n\nBe well,\n\n  \nCameron Oakes",

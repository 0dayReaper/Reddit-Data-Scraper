    "postText": "Hi Bucknell! I am really interested in transferring here but want to know how difficult it is to transfer, at least for Engineering. I know the average transfer GPA is 3.4 but I have no idea how many students actually get into Electrical Engineering. Would I be able to get in with a 3.7 GPA from Rutgers? I also wanted to know how good the engineering department was according to your opinion. I really liked the feel of the campus and the people but don't have a clue on how good the engineering department really is.",

            "comment": "I could see the transfer going through with a strong GPA, a solid HS record, and some insightful recommendations from your current professors (if they're cool with you leaving their college!). Engineering at Bucknell, as you probably know, is very competitive, but it's worth a shot, as the departments are extremely strong and do a very good job with job placement post graduation, as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat said, I'm sure Rutgers has a great engineering department, too, so you should be set either way if you keep that GPA high, build a network of contacts, and develop your soft as well as academic skills during this formative period of your life.",

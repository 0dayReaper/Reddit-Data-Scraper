Off campus, there's a bowling alley in milton, climbing wall pretty close too, good hiking/biking all over. Lewisburg has more to offer than I first thought, but really BU is all about what's on-campus. Events are always going on, you just have to look. There is a club/intramural for everyone. \nBucknell parties with the best of them. I'm in a frat and love it, but I have lots of independent friends, and to say \"thats it\" does a huge disservice to the community.",

(But it's been, holy shit, almost four years)\n\nI mean you're going to get a bunch of the typical freshmen stuff -- drinking, subscribers to [r/trees](www.reddit.com/r/trees), video games and such.\n\n\"off campus\" is a bit of a misnomer, too, as there isn't all that much off campus at BU. Some clubs do some stuff off campus, but I wasn't really involved with that overly much, so I'm not the person to ask. (But if you want my advice, do check out and maybe join a club or two). You'll probably spend some time at the Bull Run when you're over 21 off campus, or maybe when/if you have a car, but most of the stuff happens on campus.\n\nThere's a big Greek scene, or there was four years ago.\n\nBasically, it's what you decide to make of it.",

You can hook up an N64 or dvd player, and the room is a good place to have friends over. If you live down by Smith or lower campus there's 7th street and downtown is a few blocks away.\n\nSpecialty housing is like quasi-dorm life. Residential Colleges are also an added dimension because you have classes with all people on your hall, and you can sort of choose which dorm you will end up in.\n\nYour RA will plan activities for you guys. They all get a budget to spend on their hall. The school has an entire group dedicated to having events on campus, and some are definitely better than others. You can also catch a school organized bus visits to Baltimore, NYC, or other nearby cities. ",

Keep in mind they also do a fair amount of drinking because hey, it's college. There's also the debate team if that's more your style.\n\nIf they still have it up in the Langone Center, check out the rock climbing wall. Also keep an eye out for good bands playing at Uptown (the \"club\"/stage that's part of Swartz). 7th Street Cafe usually also has open mic nights and stuff like that on the weekends.\n\nClass of '09.",

                    "comment": "Yeah, most of the \"activities\" on the weekend center around drinking and going to frat or downtown house (which are usually associated with frats) parties. Bucknell tries it's best to offer alternatives such as concerts, sporting events, trips and game nights, but with its isolated geographic location, drinking is really the main attraction. If you are constantly looking for drinking alternatives, you might want to get involved with the CHOICE program, but I'm not positive about the details. \n\nI'd advise you to get involved with as many clubs and intramural sports as possible. Not only is it a great way to fill your time but it will also help you to expand your network of friends (and connections to frats). Good luck and feel free to PM me if you have any other questions.\n",

Forgive me.\n\nThis is probably because I'm old as shit in college terms (graduated almost exactly four years ago) but one of my biggest regrets about college is that I didn't take advantage of hardly any of the clubs, or talks, or activities or whatever. I did well in school, but instead of getting involved and such I slacked -- in that regard at least.\n\nYou may not care, but, if I could go back in time and re-do my college years, this is one of the few things I would **absolutely** change. \n\nConsider yourself warned :)",

Freshmen can't have cars, so you can't do much outside of the immediate town if you don't have access to a car. Even if you do have access to a car, what are you going to do?\n\nGo to Shamokin Dam or Harrisburg? Not much of a change.\n\nThere's a mall and a mall shuttle, but... it's just a mall.\n\nMost people who go to Bucknell seem to go knowing that they can just drink to their hearts' content or will be stuck in the middle of nowhere.",

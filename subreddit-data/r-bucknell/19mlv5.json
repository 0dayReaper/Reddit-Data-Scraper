    "postText": "Guys I lost my northface this weekend somewhere downtown. It's a black fleece with a zipper and northface logo on it. if anyone has seen it, please let me know! It has my ID in it.\n\nAlso, I took someone else's northface by accident thinking it was mine. It's a black fleece with a zipper and northface logo on it. I know it's not mine because it had someone else's ID in it. Though she looked very similar to me, I realized the next day that it wasn't me.\n\nEdit: My northface looks something similar to this: http://i.imgur.com/Q1RilEb.jpg\n\nThe northface I found looks something similar to this: http://i.imgur.com/ij5dyXc.jpg\n\nEdit2: I tried posting to the message center but it's not working.\n\nEdit3: Please, I really need the jacket back because it's really special and I feel like i've lost my identity without it. Also I haven't eaten in two days without my ID card.\n\nEdit4: My dad has set up a fund and help group for all who have lost northface jackets downtown. All donations will go towards helping people reconnect with their lost northface jackets. The help group meets on Thursdays at 8am and Sundays at 12PM in ELC 217.\n\nEdit5: We have been working with the Buffalo Valley Regional Police and Chief Barliar of Public safety to conduct manhunts of the downtown Lewisburg area for the many lost northface jackets. This is serious. If you see something, say something.",

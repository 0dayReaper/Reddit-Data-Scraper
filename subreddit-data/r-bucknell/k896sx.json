Always a blast and a good way to blow off steam. People are for the most part really nice and easy to get to know. There\u2019s not a whole lot of diversity on campus if that\u2019s something that is important to you. Academics can be challenging although professors are generally really nice and class sizes are typically small. The food is usually aright. With COVID, this last year has been kinda weird, the classes haven\u2019t been quite the same as some are online some are sort of in person, the grab and go food has been pretty terrible, and the campus has been pretty dead as all activities have pretty much been stopped for now but all of those things seem pretty standard across most campuses. If I am wrong about anything or missed something someone let me know.",

            "comment": "I was an engineering student a few years back. If you go for engineering I think Bucknell is a worthwhile choice since you are pretty much guaranteed a job post-grad and the professors in the engineering school were great. I was in Civil and Environmental Engineering and the professors go the extra mile for you both in-class and out of class. \n\nSocially, Boxolotl is right. Campus had a lot of good social activities but it was mainly around drinking/partying/greek life. There are other things going on, you just had to actively seek them out and become involved if that is what you are interested in. I made good friends my freshman year on my hall and then branched out with greek life and my major. By my senior year, I probably knew between 1/4 to 1/2 of my graduating class in some way personally. That could be a good or bad thing depending on who you are but I liked it. The school is not diverse as a general population, I think it was like 85% white, but I was on a very diverse freshman hall and engineering is definitely more diverse than the other majors. \n\nMake sure you have some sort of financial plan or scholarship lined up because it is a very expensive school and after 5+ years in the real world I can tell you the difference between having extensive student loans and minimal makes a lot of difference. You can probably get 90% of the experience you would get at Bucknell at a cheaper school but sometimes getting that extra 10% can be important for you. I loved my time there, both the good times and the hard times, they shaped me, but I knew others who weren't as happy and wished they made other choices so it is situational. One other note, if you are looking, also consider Lafayette and Lehigh in case they give you better scholarships because they both have good Chemical Engineering programs that I had high school friends go through and they are doing very well for themselves as well.\n\nAlso, caveat, but I don't know anything about the COVID situation so that may change things considerably.",

My freshman hall had seven Posse students including my roommate and it really helped me expand my horizons. It's an awesome program as an outsider and I made a lot of good friends through it. What city are you applying to? We had DC, Boston, and LA on my hall.",

            "comment": "I was a chemical engineering major that graduated in the last decade.  It is very challenging, but I'm sure you know that.  The CHEG faculty is awesome and I got to know many of my professors outside of the classroom.  We would chat after class or meet up with them for lunches and things such as that.  I still keep in touch with several of them and they have a vested interest in my success.  The faculty, facilities, and great classes that were offered were definitely highlights of the CHEG department\n\nI had about 22 peers in my graduating CHEG class and I became good friends with about half of them.  We were in all the same classes for 3.5 years so I really got to know them.  I hung out with them along with other people from my team or people that lived around me.  I was never in a frat, but did have friends who were involved with Greek life.  My social life didn't revolve around Greek activities or parties, but I still definitely had fun.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!",

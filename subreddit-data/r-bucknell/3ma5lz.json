    "postText": "Hi there, I am a high school student currently considering applying to Bucknell. I was wondering how the fraternity rush process works at Bucknell. When does recruitment occur for fraternities? Can anyone get into any rush event? If not, how does one go about getting recruited by a fraternity? How selective are the fraternities?\n\nI am from Texas, and I don't have any connections to Bucknell greek life.\n\nI'd just like some more information about how the fraternity rush process works at Bucknell. Thanks for your help!\n",

            "comment": "Fellow Texan here, hi! Bucknell is one of a few schools that doesn't allow rush until sophomore year. I graduated a couple of years ago so things might have changed *slightly*, but rush is a pretty well structured process, and they'll tell you all the specifics together. \n\nBasically though, the first round is you having dinner at all the houses- you can pick where you want to go, and go there. Because it's a small school and you'll already have been there a year, you'll very likely know several people who are brothers in various frats. As a freshman, getting to be friends with several brothers of a similar frat is a great way to be selected for it you second year, and a good way to know what you're getting into. \n\nThe different fraternities all had a different feel to them, you'll likely feel like you fit in better at some more than others, or not at all. No matter what anyone tries to tell you, all of those are fine options. For guys, the process is incredibly chill. Just hang out with the people you like, and if they think you're cool, you're probably in. Good luck wherever you go!",

            "comment": "You cannot rush freshman year. You don't need connections to the greek system when you come in. you have your entire freshman year to meet people and make connections to the greek system.\n\nEach fraternity has their own feel to them. and the rush system is very good at giving both the fraternity and you a good read on each other and putting you in a fraternity you will enjoy if you so choose to  join. Another thing is that even after freshman year if you choose not to join a fraternity go through rush. it is an entire week of free meals (excluding breakfast), and its better food then you would normally get from the Caf or Bison.\n\nI'll give you a not so brief overview of the rush process below.\n\nRound 1 is going to each house and hanging out, meeting the brothers and just talking, there is some food there but it's not really a meal. YOU MUST VISIT EACH HOUSE AT LEAST ONCE. After round one you put down your top 3 in order, the fraternities will get who ranked them in their top 3 but not their position or who the other two were. \n\nThis is the beginning of round 2 Meal Bids. Fraternities vote to extend meal bids to individuals. A Meal bid is an open invitation to come to eat a meal (lunch or dinner) with the brothers where you sit down and have more chats with brothers, really get a feel for how life in the fraternity is, how much they care about brotherhood and stuff like that. EVERY RUSHEE WILL RECEIVE AT MINIMUM TWO MEAL BIDS. this means that even if only 1 or 0 fraternities voted to extend you a meal bid you will be given two meal bids. you will not be informed if 0 or 2 fraternities extended a meal bid to you. At the end of Round 2 you again go back and pick your top 2 desired fraternities in order. Fraternities will receive a list of who chose them as their top two as well as if you ranked them 1 or 2, they will not know what other fraternity you picked.\n\nFrom here the brothers will vote on who they wish to extend a bid to. they then send these to the Greek office, who go through them and put together a list of people who did not receive any bids. This list is then given to the Fraternities for \"Snap Bids\" where any fraternity can extend a bid to these people. After snap bids are handed in, bids will be placed into your mail box and from that point on it is entirely up to you on if you want to accept a bid extended to you or not. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE YOU WILL RECEIVE A BID.\n\nif you accept a bid you RSVP the fraternity, and will go there to meet your fellow pledges. go sign forms stating stuff like you promise not to let yourself get hazed and will report hazing. and other stuff. From that point on you are a pledge and each fraternity does their own thing from then on.",

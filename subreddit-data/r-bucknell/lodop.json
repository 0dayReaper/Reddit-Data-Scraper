So you can go ahead and do that on the sidebar to the right!**\n\n\nA request was made for Bucknell flair. I'm going to go ahead and say it should be in the form of\n\n[Class year] - [Major (abbreviation?)]\n\nIf you'd like something in this format, either PM me or reply here with the information you'd like put up.\n\nIf anyone has suggestions for a different style, feel free to post it here as well, and we can talk about whatever is considered best!",

Sport Team?\"\n\nThe minor would probably be easily doable (along with double majors, etc) in the form of\n\n[Class year] - [Major/Major/Minor/Minor]. As an example I would be:\n\n2008 - CS/Classics\n\nAnd I think that's relatively clean. Can anyone think of a good way to put the frats/sororities and/or sports teams in there without us all having flair as long as our posts?",

Example using yours (and random additions):\n\n2008 - CS - Classics - Soccer - \u03a6K\u03a8",

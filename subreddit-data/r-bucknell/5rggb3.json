Can anyone recommend some good bars to go to at night?\n\nMy coworker and I are both 24 so we're looking for some place that won't be filled with old townies so we don't look too out of place.\n\nThanks in advance!",

If you dont mind driving I would recommend going to Bullfrog Brewery in Williamsport and Selin's grove brewery in Selinsgrove",

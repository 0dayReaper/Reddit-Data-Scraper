However, I am not sure how good it's computer science program is, I've seen Bucknell has very good rankings for enginnering majors (within colleges without doctorates) but I didnt find any computer science rankings. Are bucknell's CS and CSE programs good??",

            "comment": "I don't know what the respect is in the industry, but I graduated in the early 2000s with a computer science and engineering degree.  I recently saw 6 of my classmates and we are all doing well in our careers.  That said, we all felt that if we were applying now, it would be hard to justify the tuition costs when many state schools had similar programs.  We felt that what Bucknell did for us was make us non-nerdy computer science people.  This allowed us to advance in our careers by being both good with code, and good with people.  The number of people that have graduated Bucknell and ended up on wall street is pretty good.  \n\nAt the end of the day, if you can make the cut to get into Bucknell, you are going to do well in most things if you leave the school with a practical degree (like comp sci).  If you want to be set for the future, you can either do comp sci and bio double major so you can get a high paying career in computational biology, or comp sci and business so you can get a good analyst job in a major city to do what ever you like and just progress up a ladder.",

We had a fun computer club.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, all those guys (no gals at the time) ended up doing very, to VERY WELL after Bucknell. As the other poster had mentioned, if you get into Bucknell and socialize there effectively, you'll probably be successful in life despite the major, although, IME, it seemed they got a great grounding with a nice touch of business and management, which aided in their marketability.",

    "postText": "I am an incoming freshman for the 2021 fall semester and had a few questions about Bucknell Golf Club.\n\n\\-What is the yearlong student membership like? Is it walk on, tee times, can I play for free after paying the initial fee?\n\n\\-How do students get from Bucknell campus to the golf course?\n\n\\-Does the golf course typically stay open through the winter?\n\n\\-Is the course usually pretty busy? How is pace of play?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for any information!",

            "comment": "The year long membership fee is $450 dollars. Add another $50 if you want to store your clubs there, and a further $50 for the locker room itself. Tee times can be made in advanced and are free, however the membership does not include a cart rental or range balls. I walk to and from the course, it's about 20 mins from my dorm. I'm not sure if it stays open, but I would think so if there is no snow on the course. This year the course has been very busy and pacing has been average to slightly slow. but usually 4 to 5 hours for a full round",

            "comment": "Hi Robert,\n\nI'm a full time employee (and student employer) who works for Library and IT.  There are a number of opportunities for relevant student internships on campus (as I imagine there would be at most schools you would be attending).   My department has typically employed students in a number of technical jobs including programming related to support administrative systems/databases, Tech Desk/Tech support, classroom support and training for specific software applications including video editing software and cameras/other equipment, there are Makerspaces on campus that employ students as trainers and equipment maintainers.  Faculty hire research assistants and TAs and the SBDC (small business development center) hires students to work with local businesses.  The Teaching and Learning Center hires tutors. All jobs on campus are posted through \"the bridge\" on the Center for Career Advancement's website, and they also help students find summer internships all over the country.  There are typically opportunities to work over at least part of most breaks on campus depending on your employer on campus.  I don't believe prospective students can have access to the bridge, but you could certainly reach out to the Center for Career Advancement (linked below) and ask them any questions you might have.  \n\nGenerally you would likely find that Northeastern and BU would have higher wages for student jobs due to a higher cost of living, but also I suspect you would have more competition for those jobs, although wages on Bucknell's campus do vary quite a bit depending on the funding source of the student job and the department.    \n\nMany students I've worked with have had summer internships near their hometowns rather then on campus.  Typically housing has been provided over breaks (you have to pay taxes on the value of the housing) if you work more than 20 hours a week doing research and/or hourly work.  Work is limited to 20 hrs/week during the semester.  (obviously if you were to take an off campus job, you could work more, but that 20hrs/week is across all of your jobs on campus)\n\nObviously this info is all \"Pre Covid-19\" I am unsure how Covid-19 will affect future student employment opportunities on campus, but I suspect most of them will remain intact.  \n\nI might be biased because I am an alum (2001) and did work multiple jobs while I was on campus, including TAing a course not in my major, working for the Weis Center setting up for shows, as an RA, and as Classroom Support writing documentation and going out to classrooms to help with emergencies, but most of my student employers were great and I learned a ton in those jobs.  \n\nhttps://www.bucknell.edu/azdirectory/center-career-advancement",

            "comment": "2012 Neuroscience major here. Bucknell is a smaller school with top tier Engineering programs. Dunno how the CS department fits in with those competitively speaking, but I honestly think the biggest decision factors for you will be size and location. You're looking at relatively similar quality educations most likely, so do you want a big, medium, or small school experience? And do you want to live urban or rural?",

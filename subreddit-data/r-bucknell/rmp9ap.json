    "postText": "Hey, any physics majors at Bucknell? I'm looking to apply in a small school for physics but heard that each school has super different students, so I'd just like to meet the students in the physics department since that will be the biggest variable in my decision. How are physics students at Bucknell like? What's the culture within the department, and how would it differentiate from other LACs? (assume idk anything, I don't know much about LACs). I'm a bit worried, since I actually don't know much about physics due to the online learning disruption from COVID, I was hoping going to a smaller university would make it easier for me to catch up. Thanks!",

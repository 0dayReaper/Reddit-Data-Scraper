Or some sys admin thinks bing is awesome and makes the default image that way.\n\nOn the flip side, bucknell turned down an offer to take part in iTunes U about 6 or 7 years ago.  Stanford has one of the most widely syndicated courses every year via iTunes U and Bucknell could have been a part of that ecosystem.\n\nIn the end its all politics, not technical merit.",

And because they're the best most amazing people on earth, they don't like to hear other people's opinions either.\n\nSo it's entirely possible someone in there just has a real love of Bing.",

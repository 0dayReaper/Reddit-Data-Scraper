The wedding is in Lewisburg and I want to get them something special as their gift.  They live in town, love the area and people, and intend to begin the next step of their lives there.\n\nI have been to Lewisburg a few times but not enough to know the area well.  This is where I am turning to you for help.\n\nI need local knowledge in regard to what possible gift to give them.  I want the gift to be locally sourced and be meaningful to them both.\n\nMain Points\n-Both are Outdoorsy\n-Renovating a House\n-Have Cats and Dogs\n\nSecondary Points\n-Both are well-read\n-Bride is involved in Arts (pottery, ceramics, paint...etc)\n-Both involved with Current Events\n-Both enjoy craft beer and cocktails\n\nThe main focus of this post is to find locally owned shops and/or artisans that might provide a perfectly personalized gift to a couple that are truly in love.\n\nThanks in advance to any and all responses.\n\n*Using my throwaway in case my friend is a Redditor",

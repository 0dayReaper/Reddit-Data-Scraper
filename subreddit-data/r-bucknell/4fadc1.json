    "postText": "Is it really cliquey and preppy as it is made out to be?  I am middle class Asian that likes to wear comfortable jeans and a sweatshirt, but Bucknell seems to be mostly upper class white individuals that are quite preppy.  The biggest turn off for me would be cliqueyness though.  My high school is small and I love how wveryone knows everyone, but it's so cliquey and I want to avoid that in a college.  One of my friend's friend went to Bucknell and transferred out because she couldn't stand the social life there.  Is there any truth about anything I've mentioned or are they all just stereotypes?  I went on a Bucknell tour and talked to some students.  They were either engineering or arts majors but they were all nice and down to earth. I don't know which to believe.  This being a small school in the middle of nowhere makes it even more important for me to feel comfortable socially on campus as there isn't much else here.  Thank you",

            "comment": "Yes and no. But I think that's kind of everywhere (just the nature of the cliques changes)\n\nSo I graduated almost 8 years ago now (ugh!) and maybe the culture has changed, but here's my take:\n\nI was a computer science major and so I hung out largely with other engineering types, as well as a few friends in some of the less \"bro\" frats and sororities.\n\nThere are a lot of very preppy people, that is certainly true. And because the greek culture is pretty big at Bucknell there's are definitely a lot of insular groups that seek to party whenever possible.\n\nThat said, there are a bunch of people that don't really engage with that, or do so in a pretty limited manner. They might be the overall minority, but they're certainly around. No one is really going to care if you wear jeans and a sweatshirt... you wouldn't be the only one (past maybe the first few weeks of the year, *maybe*)\n\nWhat you will experience is the \"Bucknell Bubble\". I have to imagine this is the same sort of thing that you'd find at any middle-of-nowhere college, but Bucknell is very insular. Many people don't keep up with the outside world (politics, recent events, whatever) if it's not effecting Bucknell itself.\n\nThere was a lot of drinking and that was one of the main social activities. I myself only really participated in that in any real way toward the end of my Junior year and I only ever felt left out before I started to drink a tiny bit now and again.\n\nBasically, Bucknell will be whatever you make of it and you can probably find people you'll wanna hang out with, but you'll definitely find people you wont want to hang out with too :)\n\nBtw, good luck wherever you go!",

            "comment": "Lots of people wear jeans and sweatshirts, so that isn't really anything to worry about. But it's definitely a unique environment. The social scene is really greek life oriented, so if you're into that, you're in luck. If not, it's really just about finding your own clique via clubs/res college/ etc.\n\nEdit: That guy up there puts it a lot more eloquently. And as a student currently attending Bucknell, that's pretty accurate.",

There have been one or two incidents recently, which admittedly is not a lot, but its a little uncomfortable to hear. I am Indian and we seem to be a pretty small minority here.  I don't really mind if the school isn't super diverse, but some diversity would be a nice change from my high school.",

But as a (very) white person, I don't suppose I can say that with any authority.\n\nBucknell is not going to be anywhere near as diverse as a school in or very close to a city, though. I'd say at least 70-80% of the people at Bucknell during my time were North East Caucasian in terms of culture, with maybe some portion of that being some sort of Cali-North East hybrid.\n\nI'm not really sure if I'm helping or rambling at this point, though :) ",

A school could be 40% Asian but if they all selfsegregate by their ethnic group then it doesn't mean as much as a lower percentage but everyone gets along well. I don't mean to offend anyone with the various stereotypes I mentioned in my original post, I just like hearing actual students experiences rather than looking at racial percentage breakdowns, etc. I know you were a CS major, but do you know anyone or have any comments on the business school in general or their recruiting?  It seems to do well for such an isolated school but a large percentage got jobs from cold calling compared to something like past internships or on campus recruiting.  I feel like that's not a good sign for the opportunities available on campus for jobs.",

But there are a ton of programs and organizations that really bring minorities together. I partook in a couple myself. /u/Kevek is right about finding your group of color. The whole diversity issue kinda becomes obscure once you surround yourself with the right people.",

I didn't really have many friends involved in it.\n\nSome of the lack of jobs from past internships and such I'd attribute to the kind of Bucknell-bubble lack of thought of things outside of the school. There was definitely a contingent of people that didn't want to move on and become an adult and so sort of ignored the reality of needing to figure out their next steps.\n\nBut there were also loads of people that got internships that turned into jobs. That's one of those \"it's really up to the individual and not the school\" sort of things, in my book.",

The only thing I would say is that faculty and administration are really making an effort to connect students to outside the Bucknell bubble and make sure we're informed citizens. I'd say there is some decent progress with younger classes becoming more involved with the world at large. ",

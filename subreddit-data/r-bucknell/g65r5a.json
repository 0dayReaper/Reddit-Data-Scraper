    "postText": "Calling all Bucknell students, and more specifically, CAS students. I am currently a junior at Brookline High School and am very interested in Political Science at CAS. I was wondering if anyone here could tell me about it and what kind of path you took to get in, just so I can get an idea of what a Bucknell student is made of. (i.e any courses you took, gpa, test scores...) That would be extremely helpful. Thank you!",

I had a 3.7 or 3.8 GPA from a tiny public school and SAT was 680 reading and 670 math, 690 writing...I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s still a writing part to the SAT. I did a ton of Extracurricular stuff. \n\nEarly decision is very helpful. I got in regular app pool but ED helps pretty much anywhere. \n\nBucknell was very homogenous, white middle/upper to upper/upper middle class. There is diversity of you get involved though, my friends were all different colors and backgrounds. \n\nBucknell is the definition of a bunch of big fish in little ponds going into little fish, big pond. \n\nVery very athletic students, I was the #1 tennis player on my high school team for 2 years, could serve 116mph and I could barely keep up with the club team. \n\nI got to rebuild houses in New Orleans twice in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. I went to Nicaragua twice and learned/experienced real poverty, which has seriously shaped my path, directed me towards Med school and now I\u2019ve been training as a physician in some of the toughest cities on the east coast. \n\nI double majored BS biology and BA international relations with a concentration in Latin American studies. I really liked my poli sci Professors a lot, I knew some people did research with them. I did research with my genetics professor. \n\nUltimately, you get what you put in. It\u2019s VERY easy to fall in line, go to class, study, party, repeat, but you can absolutely broaden your experiences just by looking for opportunities and saying yes to new experiences.",

    "postText": "Hey, I'll be a new freshman at Bucknell.  I have been looking at the job placement report on Bucknell's website and I have a few questions.  Of the analysts hired to bulge-bracket banks (i.e. JPM, GS, BAML, etc.) are they front office positions?  Secondly, how well does Bucknell fare in terms of consulting placement out of undergraduate?  I noticed on the job report that mainly Deloitte Consulting &amp; Accenture hire for consulting with the rare addition of a BCG or Booz every few years.  Lastly, how tough is the econ major relative to the BSBA degree in accounting and finance?  Thanks so much!! 'ray Bucknell!",

Every career fair and networking event I have been to features many of those companies. Deloitte Consulting is super aggressive on campus in recruitment. I have been given water bottles, mugs, and various gifts from Deloitte at events.\nEmail the Career development Center! By the way there is a huge networking event tomorrow afternoon so I will check for these companies.",

I just have a quick question on the Campus Enrichment Scholarship (just received my Fin. Aid Info.) and was curious what the minimum requirements were to keep it -- but if you don't know, I just want to say you have been very informative!  How did the event go? \n\n",

Science, Pre-med, engineering, computer science etc. If you want to be a greedy piece of shit when you graduate then study finance. You will not only get sucked into a monkey-suit/wall street slave type job but you will also be an alcoholic since all you will be doing at Bucknell is drinking. You sure as fuck wont be studying ",

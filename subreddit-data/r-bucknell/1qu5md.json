    "postText": "I'm looking to move out west after graduating this spring with a MechE degree, and was wondering if there are any current engineering grads working out there that I could talk to. I'm having trouble finding job opportunities as no companies that I've found so far actively target Bucknell grads like companies back east. I'm going to be outside Denver skiing at Winter Park between Christmas and New Years, maybe we could meet up for drinks? Let me know.",

It's booming out here right now and engineers hire like hotcakes at breweries; that GPA will get your foot in the door wherever you want it to. You might have student loans, which is definitely a consideration because the industry doesn't pay much. It's one of the most fun careers that you can embark on out here though, so just check it out.

    "postText": "I'm a senior right now in high school and bucknell is my top choice. I've visited three times, and all three times there have been crazy parties, with students passing out in the streets at 4 in the afternoon. I don't really drink but I'm not uncomfortable around it. When I was there, it seemed like the only things you could do is drink and party and study. All the people you can contact at the school will tell you \"theres plenty of stuff to do\" but here I want the non bullshit answer. ",

            "comment": "I went to Bucknell for my masters degree, so I guess you can take this with a grain of salt, but because of that the undergraduates that I did get to know well were not partiers either. For the most part, there is a lot to do. So you can obviously party and not get drunk/pass out drunk anyway! Just thought I would throw that out there. Anyways, there are also lots of things run by the university on a basically weekly and sometimes daily basis, different activities and groups for things like, oh I don't know, sushi making or beer/wine tasting or art classes, etc. Also there are larger things the school puts on, like movie nights outside and stuff. Lots of students also make smaller groups of friends that also don't party and do stuff on their own, like go into Lewisburg and hang out, rent a projector (free!) from the library and have a movie night/sports night, go somewhere in PA to go kayaking or skiing, etc. ",

Not because of the not drinking, just that they'd have unusual hobbies, be awkward, or very very academic or something.\n\nThat's not a bad thing, but just something to be cognizant of.",

Check out the activities fair during admitted students day in April.  There are the international student associations (SASA, CCA, etc) but membership isn't limited to people from those specific areas if you're interested in other cultures, there are theatre groups, a LARP club, acappella clubs, the Outing club, a bicycling club, intermural sports, plenty of opportunities for community service, trips to NYC, DC and other nearby cities and all of the things that /u/jenadactyl mentioned. \n\nI graduated in 2001, and there were fewer options then, but I still only went to a handful of frat parties, and I always left once people started getting stupid drunk. (I was never comfortable with it either)  It's a bit more difficult to find your niche if you're not into the parties, (My first semester was rough!) but I have some wonderful friends, and I met my husband there.  I also currently work at Bucknell (but not in admissions), and am an advisor for C.A.L.V.I.N. &amp; H.O.B.B.E.S. so I might be a bit biased, but my experience was that while you can't entirely avoid other people who choose to drink, you can make the choice to hang out with other like minded individuals. \n\nI am probably one of the \"odd\" people that /u/kevek mentioned, but I'm OK with that :)\n\nWhat kind of things do you participate in now that you'd like to continue doing or things that you would like to explore while in college?",

I have looked into it and I can dive for bucknell as a walk on potentially, can't play tennis and theres no snowboarding around there. All my schools that have a good rep (like buck) are on the east coast. I really want to be in the mountains for school so I'm also applying to schools in colorado so idk about the reputation/education. \n\nI like to hang with friends (no alcohol) and I really like to just relax with my buddies.

I don't know what it's called or how far out it is, but I know they've gone out on weeknights, so I doubt it's too terribly far away, but yeah, there's nothing super close.\n\nGood luck in your search!  I know there's a lot of good skiing in Vermont/New Hampshire area, and I know Dartmouth and Middlebury are other schools we often get compared with that are in more mountainous areas.",

Are their any facilities on campus that are open to the public, or do you need a student ID to access everything? Thanks for your help",

There are plenty of outdoor basketball courts though and I doubt anyone would give you a hard time for using them or the fields across 15, assuming no practices are happening of course (they\u2019re playing both fall and spring sports right now). Not sure if the tennis courts would be locked or not. There are also some soccer fields over by Riverwoods. Technically I think they\u2019re private but they\u2019re in the middle of nowhere and doubt anyone would be around to kick you out.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, Bucknell\u2019s going test-optional this application cycle and so I\u2019ve been debating whether or not to send my score.\n\nIs a 1350 a good enough score to send? I know the middle 50% range last year was a 1250-1420 but I\u2019m scared it may hurt me. \n\nFor context: I have a 91W/96 W GPA (roughly 3.64/3.84 I think)\n\nThanks in advance!",

An average SAT might not open any doors, but it won\u2019t close them either (and you\u2019re still higher than about half of other admits!) Tbf, the SAT is probably one of the least important parts of the application.",

These days, your SAT score basically only acts as a metric for how well you perform under pressure (within the context of the standard American high school education).\n\nSource: Bucknell alum (2012) with a 1290 SAT, also took the ACT twice and got 34 both times; sent all the scores.",

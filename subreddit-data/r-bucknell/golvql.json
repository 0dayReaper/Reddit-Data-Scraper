Definitely a bunch of reading involved lol. For college shopping- go for comfort over style. I would also keep an eye out for summer reading (if you are required).",

I'm about to finish my summer reading, so I've ordered a book series for the summer (hopefully, I'll be able to finish it before my departure to Bucknell). \n\nI'll definitely take the clothing tip into account when shopping; it's my first time going to an academic institution without a specific uniform (high schools in my country have uniforms), so I'm a bit puzzled on what's considered comfortable and what's considered \"oh that student just rolled out of bed\", but I guess I'll figure it somehow lol.",

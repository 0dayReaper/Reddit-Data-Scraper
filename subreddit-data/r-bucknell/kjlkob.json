    "postText": " Hi! I will be applying to Bucknell as an international applicant. I just had a few questions about the college before applying.\n\n1) I require a lot of financial aid (EFC:$8k). How is the financial aid for international students at Bucknell?\n\n2) I will be applying as a CS major. How is the CS major at Bucknell? What are the internship opportunities, job placements, and grad school placements like?\n\n3) What are the best and worst things about Bucknell?\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "I'm a US citizen, but never lived in the US until I came to university. For context, I went to a very small grade school (graduated among a class of 17), so though I looked at cities, too, I was happy in a small school.\n\nI actually really liked my experience at Bucknell, but I will say that it initially felt very alienating being an international student. It feels like 98% of the student body comes from the New Jersey and Pennsylvania area, and there were constantly all these cultural references that were just very foreign to me -- TV shows, etc. The town itself is small, too; when I went there weren't ethnic restaurants and I doubt that has changed too much. (And, I didn't have money for restaurants, anyway.)\n\nThat being said, Bucknell has a huge number of clubs, etc to find people you like to hang out with. The fact that it's a small college means that (in my experience) you really get to know a lot of good people. I hated the Greek system and that didn't impede my experience.",

I could go through FAFSA, etc. Not sure what the process is like for int'l students.\n\nIt's also worth noting that you can save some money by doing things like becoming an RA, if that's something that might interest you. I didn't do it just for the cost savings, but not paying for housing was nice.",

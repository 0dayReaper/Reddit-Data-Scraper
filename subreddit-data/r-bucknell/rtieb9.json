That\u2019s a big downside here - aside from small gatherings in individual dorm rooms there aren\u2019t really any parties going on besides athletic teams and frats. It\u2019s unfortunate, but this doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have an awesome time. \n\nI\u2019m a freshman and have gotten into only a few frat parties and there\u2019s one month left of my freshman year. I have met the closest friends I\u2019ve ever had in the floor above me, we party in their room upstairs and it\u2019s great. \n\nSophomore year you will most likely have to make the decision whether you want to rush or don\u2019t want to. Many people come and realize the fraternities are a good experience and end up rushing, because they are. \n\nHope this helps.",

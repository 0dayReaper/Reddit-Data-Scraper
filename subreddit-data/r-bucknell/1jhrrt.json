            "comment": "My opinion: I agree with this move. Yes, Bucknell has certainly been heavy-handed with anti-alcohol moves in the past. Wasn't it 2003-4 where they actually banned hard liquor on campus, even for people of age? However, it's just not a good idea to have a university sponsored event that regularly puts kids in the hospital.\n\nI attended House Party. I had a good time. And I have absolutely no problem with drinking and partying in college. But it just doesn't look good for the university to, functionally, facilitate binge drinking.\n\nOf course it's easy for me to say all this now that I'm out of school. I'd love to hear a student perspective on this.",

                    "comment": "Let me start this off by saying I'm a GDI, so my opinion maybe be slightly biased in some way. My sophomore year I decided to buy a wristband, and had a blast participating in the weekend's events with a few of my Greek friends. I kept in mind my limits, paced myself through Friday night/Saturday, and overall it was a great experience. However, I think that having a university condoned drinking weekend can lead to the things mentioned in the letter, such as 15 hospitalizations. In addition to that, the number of thefts over the weekend was absolutely absurd. The event brings in many guests from other places, and I think with that a sense of non-accountability. \n\nIn addition to that, it's incredibly disturbing to me that many of my peers feel that it is appropriate to drink before or even DURING classes on the Friday of house party weekend. Your professors deserve more respect than that, not to mention students in the classes who may not want to be subjected to the party-hard mentality.  \n\nThis could go many different ways, but I feel that it's a positive move in the right direction. The amnesty policy changes show that Bravman isn't trying to make everyone miserable, and rather that he is trying to create a more cohesive and safe environment. Bucknell is a good school, and things like throwing up on the seal is just completely out of place. This could mark the beginning of a stricter policy, but for now, I think we (students) should handle it maturely. BarstoolU posted commentary on the letter ([here](http://www.barstoolsports.com/m/barstoolu/super-page/bucknell-university-cancels-house-party-weekend-after-student-writes-letter-to-president-complaining-about-too-much-campus-drinking/)), but I really hope that this mentality isn't one held by the majority of my peers: \n\n\"Here at Bucknell we are dedicated to contributing to the complete and total Pussification of America and therefore have decided to ban House Party Weekend in an attempt to prevent any college kid from having any sort of fun whatsoever. \"\n\nTL;DR Bravman isn't trying to destroy our college experience, and I think it's a positive move in the right direction",

In fact, I saw it in my freshman year class in which only one or two students were upperclassmen... which means only one or two students could be affiliated. Cancelling house party isn't about making the greek system \"pay so dearly\". If you're talking about punishment here, than the entire campus was punished. With fifteen hospitalizations and multiple robberies, the administration couldn't continue to support this weekend in good conscious. The fact is that a few idiots can ruin it for everyone. I 100% agree with you that, in its purest form, house party is an awesome concept to bring the campus together, both greek and non-greek alike. In addition to that, it's a tradition. But some idiots have ruined it for the majority of the student body, and an institution can't continue to support an event that students view as an excuse to drink to excess. ",

There is no actual safety feature blocking an individual from alcohol poisoning. And don't try to say the human body has its own built in features such as vomiting, because I hate to break it to you but if you're vomiting you already have alcohol poisoning. \n\nYou're getting distracted from the point that the university has a reputation to uphold, and is responsible for the safety its students and guests.

Does anyone actually think this is going to have a negative impact on the party scene at Bucknell?  There are still going to be parties every day on the weekends.  There are still going to be parties during the week.  I don't understand why everyone's freaking out over the university (which has already been getting a negative hype over the whole SAT score thing) taking a public stance against binge drinking.  It's really not a big deal.  Y'all are still going to be able to get fucked up every day of the week, all semester long if you want to.  \n\nHouse Party always struck me as one of the weirdest parts of Bucknell.  The school is soooooo overtly anti-alcohol, yet they sponsor an entire weekend devoted to getting as fucked up as you possibly can.  There's nothing wrong with going hard in college- I certainly did!  That's no excuse for the university to encourage that behavior, though.  It's supposed to be a place of learning.",

Of course I got drunk all weekend but I knew how to handle myself.  Way too many students were unable to do so.  It's sad that an awesome and fun tradition like house party is no more.  I was a gdi but I had friends in many frats.  It was fun to be able to hangout with everyone and not have to worry about ratios and other lame fray party things.  The university needed a change though.  This was probably the best way to facilitate that change, like it or not",

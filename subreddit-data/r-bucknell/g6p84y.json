I was 18 yo at the time and made a decision to go to this school without much financial planning or consideration. It costed me about 34k a year after aid. College especially Bucknell is ridiculously expensive so unless you can afford it, I would advise you reconsider. Are your parents footing the bill? Loans, equity, or cash?",

We're pretty well off but just cannot afford 75k tuition even when i got the 15k scholarship, especially bc my older brother is still finishing up school. They did not give us anything at all, unfortunately. Yes, I saw that, thanks! Still undoable for us though. stay safe",

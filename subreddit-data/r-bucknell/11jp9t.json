    "postText": "As the title says, I am thinking of applying to the animal behavior graduate program at Bucknell. The campus looks very nice, and I have identified some staff researching things I am very interested in. However, I live in California and know close to nothing about Pennsylvania, except that it's a blue state and that Hershey's chocolate comes from there. . .\n\nSome questions I have:\n(1) How is the grad program in animal behavior? Is it difficult to get in?\n(2) Tell me about Lewisberg; fun downtown? Any bars? Good restaurants? What is there to do besides school?\n(3) Housing. Is it easy to get? Is is expensive? How far from campus can I expect to live as a grad student?\n(4) Would you recommend the school?\n(5) Anything else you can think of.\n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "I'm a graduate student in animal behavior. Feel free to PM me if you want to chat.\n\n(1) Very good, and quite unique. I work with the primates, and they are funded by the university rather than grands, so there is little to no pressure to publish, which is nice. This means you get to focus on developing your skills and working on your projects. I don't know much about the other labs here, unfortunately.\n\n(2) It's okay. I'm not really a go out to bars kind of person, and they definitely get crowded at busy times (like, frat-tastic crowded). But they're good, the people are friendly, and lots of professors hang out there in the afternoons so it's a good place to chill. The restaurant selection is, in my opinion, abysmal. However, it is getting better. There is good Thai food, a new Japanese restaurant, a French place (pricey), and a very, very good farmer's market once a week. There isn't a lot to do HERE besides school, but there are a lot of things around it, a few theme parks, breweries, wineries, etc. \n\n(3) Fairly easy to get, but difficult to find online. Often you get sort of the 'hand me down' from other graduate students. So you find someone who is moving out, and find their landlord and try to get the place. It's not too expensive. Last year I lived in a one bedroom for $595 which included water and heat and low quality internet, so I paid $595 + electricity + cable. Now I live in a two bedroom with my boyfriend and a roommate, we each pay $240 + 1/3 electricity + 1/3 cable. It is obviously more expensive to live alone, but not outrageous. I can walk to campus in about fifteen minutes at a snail's pace.\n\n(4) Yes. But obviously I'm biased.",

            "comment": "Hi, I'm currently a sophomore at Bucknell and I can really only answer a few of these questions as I'm not in the animal behavior program.\n\n(2) Lewisburg is a fairly small town but there are several bars and good restaurants.  I'm still under 21 but it seems as though the over 21 crowd has a good time at the local bars.  There aren't too many grad students here but I'm sure you would have a decent social life.  I won't say Lewisburg is the most exciting place in the world (because it's not) but it's certainly not devoid of recreation.\n\n(3) There is a lot of competition for the houses closest to campus from upperclassmen; most of the best ones are taken up to two years in advance.  There are a lot of equally nice houses a little further away (really not too far, probably on the order of a half mile or so) that are usually available with reasonable time to spare.  I know some grad students even live on campus but I'm not really sure how that works out.   \n\n(4) I would definitely recommend the school, we have a good reputation and great facilities.  I wish I could tell you more about the animal behavior program but you might have to research that a little more on your own.  Pretty much all I know is that we have some monkeys on campus.  Which is cool I guess.\n\n(5) The campus is absolutely beautiful.  Without a doubt one of the nicest in the country.  Come visit if you can, or talk to a professor more.  \n\nHope I was of some help!",

                    "comment": "Thanks for the info! I just noticed the undergraduate student fees of $5,000.00 per course! Do you know if that price is the same for graduate students? I know most public universities wave tuition fees, but Bucknell, being private, probably would not, correct? I also understand you're still an undergraduate, and so no worries if you don't know the situation for grad students!",

There is a huge strip of restaurants, a mall, and some nicer places and bars in the town like BJ's and Selinsgrove Brew Pub. If you keep going south, you'll run into the Pennsyltucky you might have heard of. Amish on the road, quilt shops and adult outlets every half mile, littered with the occasional strip club, swingers joint, and Dr. Tom's Leather.  ",

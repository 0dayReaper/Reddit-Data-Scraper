I want to major in Electrical Engineering I like the idea of a small program where I can get to know my professors but am a little concerned that the program at Buck is \"too\" small. What are everybodies thoughts? ",

I did a BS in Computer Science, and the way that works in BU you end up in a lot of classes with the Computer Engineers, and many of my freshman hallmates were Civies  &amp; Mechies. So that's my background. I was not in the Greek system.\n\nGreek culture is important at BU... I felt often like three out of four people were in a frat or a sorority. I don't know the real percentage, though it would be easy to look up, but that's how I felt. As I imagine that plays out in most places there were groups within the Greeks that I got along with fine, and groups I didn't. It's just a codified way for people to form clicks.\n\nAs an engineer you can either avoid it or not, just like any other student. It's really up to you. I knew some engineers who partied with the rest of them (though their grades suffered a little) and I knew engineers who probably only ever went to a small handful of parties their entire time at Bucknell - or none. There are a lot of parties -- but if you never seek it out, then you never seek it out. This, like most things in college is what you make of it.\n\nIf you go to Bucknell, too, you'll hear about the \"Bucknell Bubble\" -- or at least, this was true a few years ago -- the concept that the world outside of Bucknell kind of fades away while you're there because you're so isolated and rural. Depending on what you like that too can be positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nThe Engineers I knew were very often quite busy. Looking in, it seems like quite a bit of work. (The exception to this might be the Computer Engineers). I think most of the engineering students from Bucknell I know are somewhere between relatively and very happy to have gone, in regards to engineering.\n\nI know nothing about the Presidential Fellows program, so I can't help there.",

Engineers are probably equally as Greek as non-engineers. People won't give you trouble about not joining, but you will be recruited. The rush process is formal and you should do it for the free food, networking, and you can always not join a fraternity at the end.\n\nYou can 'party' as much as you want. I don't think you can get away with partying and slacking, especially in engineering. Greek life is big, but you will have both Greek and non-Greek friends. That means greek friends can put you on the list for parties if you decide not to join a fraternity, but want to occasionally go out.",

I visited a friend at Case for a few weeks and it was disappointing to see how so many ppl just cut themselves off from their hallmates or don't make an effort to step outside of their comfort zone. Its just their campus culture.\n\nBucknell is better socially, plus they have such great feeder programs and they're bffls with alumni, you're pretty much guaranteed a job in the fall of your senior year. It helps that theres always like 7 companies recruiting EEs at every career fair and you only have 10 fellow bucknell students to compete with.",

My bud canceled on me last minute, and I\u2019m thinking of still heading up from Lanc to catch the show. 31/m, and I bring to the table: college football knowledge, awful puns, and an extra ticket. Plus, I\u2019ll probably buy a round or two, and I\u2019m pretty easy to have fun with (or so I\u2019ve been told). \n\nPM me for deets.\n\nGo Bison",

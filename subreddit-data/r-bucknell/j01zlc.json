            "comment": "I was in a frat - but much much longer than 3 years ago. I was able to balance my school work with fratnernal things, but I'll be honest, looking back on that experience I don't regret it - BUT I do think if I did it all again I would reconsider joining. \n\nI made some of the best friends I still keep in touch with today through the fraternity, BUT some of my closest friends were all independent. In fact, two of my groomsmen were bucknellians that were independent and I straddled the line between hanging out with my frat and with my independent friends. \n\nIn the moment it can seem like everyone at bucknell is in a fraternity and that it's the ONLY way to have fun, but I can promise you, that's not at all the case. \n\nI was in Phi Kappa Psi for what it's worth. Word on the street is they were shut down recently? I think? I loved that house and the guys in my year. I think it really evolved after I left into something it was not while I was there.",

Parties, girls, alcohol, weed &amp; you will make a few friends for a lifetime. Some frats keep copies of old exams to make studying easier. You will laugh all the time. \n\nThe Bad? Super cliquey, lots of bullying/picking on, sink or swim mentality, randoms/GDIs will label you based on your frat. Harder to balance school &amp; social life. People seam to either thrive in that environment (well-rounded) or get too caught up in it and fuck up in school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts? Please respond so I know you've read this comment I put a ton of work into.",

I\u2019m sorry I only caught it now but it will still help as I think this through. \n\nReally appreciate it! \n\nSo, did you end up in a frat? If so, which one? \nAny regrets? \n\nThings you were glad about? \n\nDoes it work if drinking is your thing, not pot, coke, etc?",

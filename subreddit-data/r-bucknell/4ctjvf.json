    "postText": "Hello Bucknellers, or whatever you refer to yourselves as!\n\n\nI'm a HS senior hearing back from colleges. While I didn't apply to Bucknell, I kind of regret my choice not to now and was considering transferring mid-Freshman year or sometime in Sophomore year of college. I'd like to know how hard it would be to transfer, and what time of my college years I should go about doing so. \n\n\n**ALSO** if you could, how would you rate the quality of the following courses?\n\n\n- Film/Media studies (does it have anything to do with film production?)\n\n- Classics and Ancient Mediterranean \n\n- Philosophy\n\n- Anything close to a Medieval-Renaissance program",

It really is dependant on your work ethic and your ability to stay away from partying.  As a freshman male, that shouldn't be too hard since the social scene is not that large for a first semester freshman male.",

In regards to some of the courses you asked about, i was actually a classics major.  The professors are fantastic and bucknell is lucky to have larson and daly running the department.  they actually run a dig in Thebes so having that kind of connection is pretty awesome.  I only took one film class but it was more of a deeper look into the films rather than a technical class.  At least when i was there there were not many, if any, film making classes.  hope this helps ",

I've heard that they're trying to make education 101 harder though because everyone takes it for the easy A, lol.",

Just remember that you'll have the last pick of fun/easy electives, so just be patient.  As for choosing housing, do you mean what dorm to actually live in?  If you live in Swartz, you can roll out of bed 10 minutes before class and make it to Dana (eng. building) or Olin (math/sciences)  easily.  I had the time of my life living in Vedder, though.  Good luck!",

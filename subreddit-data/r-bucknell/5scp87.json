I think several schools use that, I'm not sure? In terms of actually knowing what classes are available that semester, once you become a student the school gives you access to course registration stuff so you can decide what you're going to register for before you actually do it. There are also course catalogs online as well as your progress report that shows what required classes you need to take. I don't know if you really needed all that info or if you just wanted a scheduling website, sorry, but in terms of scheduling websites no8am is great. Hope that helped!",

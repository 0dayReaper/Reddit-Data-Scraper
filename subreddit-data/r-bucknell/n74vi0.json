            "comment": "CS and engineering here. Overall they are pretty much the same. I don't think it affects your chance of getting jobs at all. BS in College of Arts and Science has more liberal arts requirements while BS in Engineering has more Electrical courses or hardware courses. You will have more space in your schedule as a BS but you also have to fulfill other requirements like Diversity in the US or Foreign Language etc. Both can be in double major program, with the difference being that BS CS do it in 4 years and BS Engineering do it in 5 years (as they have to also fulfill College of Arts and Science requirements).\nAlso both, and even BA are under the same department, taught by the same group of professors.\nSwitching into college of engineering is hard but not impossible. Switching out is easier.",

    "postText": "I am applying to Bucknell and I was wondering about whether Bucknell is good for someone planning to go to medical school and what is the best major/college in Bucknell if I want to go to medical school. I know that I can go to medical school from any major as long as I get the MCAT, but I wanted to hear opinions about which major will help me the most most .  \nI will love to hear all the opinions",

            "comment": "Hi - this sub is a bit quiet, but as an alum I graduated with a few friends who went to med school after Bucknell. Most were bio/chem majors, as you might imagine. The bio department is particularly strong, and has great links with Geisinger Health System, so you'd have some opportunities for studies in the field, networking, and internships. \n\nA little more of a departure, but I knew a mechanical engineer from BU who went on to med school. I think he became an orthopedic surgeon, so it does make sense after all! Even more of a departure, I lived with a guy who was an English lit major. He came from a family of doctors, and maybe was rejecting that lifestyle while in college, but after did end up getting his medical degree.",

I think the biochem major is a good choice but you really could do almost any major as long as you get the pre reqs in. I know a few docs who have engineering degrees who spent a few years in the industry and then went to med school, and several others who had a degree in English or other humanities, and did teach for america before going to med school",

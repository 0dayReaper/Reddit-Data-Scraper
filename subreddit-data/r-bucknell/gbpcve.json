The class sizes were smaller, the community was tighter knit, everything was walkable, the clubs and varsity teams were numerous without being super competitive, and without all of the offerings of a city more fun was had on campus with friends at a lower cost.",

            "comment": "I was between those schools back in 2005;however the differences remain the same. BU is a city school at which you will have the college experience, but also have the opportunity to go out and live the city life too. Bucknell on the other hand is a classic college experience. It has a beautiful campus. There is little to do outside of campus activity and college parties. \n\nAcademically, you will get a great education either place. However, Bucknell is smaller and you will have the benefit of smaller classes. \n\nI loved Bucknell, however it comes down to what you are looking for. In my opinion you have the rest of your 20s for a city college experience, but you will never again have the opportunity to live on a classic college campus like Bucknell.",

The classes are hard and everyone is dealing with their own struggles, but don\u2019t act like they are having difficulty. It creates an \u201cIvy League environment\u201d which makes you want to work harder.",

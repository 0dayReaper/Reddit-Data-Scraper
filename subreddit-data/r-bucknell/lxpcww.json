            "comment": "In short, it\u2019s an almost indistinguishable degree from biology with stricter parameters of what you can and can\u2019t take. The greatest pro is the community, people and professor network. \n\nIt\u2019s a tiny major (typically &lt;10), so you\u2019ll get very close with your class. A majority of people chose the BA as they can double major. BS had exponentially more Chem, math and physics, but opens you up to more opportunities if you want to pursue certain kinds of grad schools/employment. \n\nThis is NOT a pre vet degree. A lot of pre vet start in ANBE, then transition to normal biology bc it\u2019s more flexible to check all the pre reqs. However, pre vet is still common coming out of ANBE. ANBEs are not the highest paid graduates, but all of my peers work in what they sought out to do as undergrads. I put this down to the passionate people who finish with the major and the tight connections with professors/research opportunities we were uniquely granted in the major. \n\nGraduates typically fall evenly into 3 categories: \n\nGrad schools/professional degree affiliated careers (veterinary science (DVM), PhD, masters ect)\n\nWork in the animal field (A LOT of zookeepers, animal research techs, pet store associates)\n\nWork in a completely unrelated line of work (the world is your oyster, ha, with this bachlors)",

I'm a senior who was accepted into American and I'm really considering attending but I have some serious questions on the food.\n\nOverall what are the thoughts on the food, I've seen mixed reviews but overall leans is on the negative side(at least what I've seen). What is the general consensus? Where is food the best? Where is food to be avoided? \n\nThanks in advance!!!",

TDR is not good though some of the options there are fine but you'll get very tired of eating them day after day. There are a bunch of other options on campus that are solid, and while you'll definitely enjoy them, a lot of people like myself end up becoming a subway sandwich after eating there all day every day. That wasn't much of a problem for me, and if it isn't a problem for you then you'll be perfectly fine. If you care more about having more varied and high quality food you'll just have to take more time to get groceries and use eaglebucks and your own money in tenleytown. The downside to that is it means spending more money, but the upside is that the food in tenleytown is generally great. Overall it's not a horrible situation for food, but you're definitely gonna have that 'college experience' where you find yourself starving at 1 AM and the only thing open is subway but you had subway for the past 3 days in a row but fuck it time to get another sandwich",

The vendor changed recently, but I haven't heard of any real differences. The food at the East Campus market is somewhat decent. \n\nNot sure what the deal with the old bagel place is now, but it was closed due to a rat infestation. There's a Starbucks in that same area, so that's great.\n\nAll that said, the campus is within 10 minutes from some awesome food options. Tenleytown has some good quick food vendors that take Eagle Bucks. You'll never run out of postmates choices either. I can go on for hours about the best Postmates/Doordash options near Campus.",

If you get a meal plan I would take advantage of the meal exchange program, which lets you get certain items at on-campus restaurants (not Tenleytown) with meal swipes (which disappear at the end of the semester) instead of eagle bucks (which transfer semester to semester as it is a charge card). This works for the burger and chicken restaurant, the pizza place, and in a normal year subway as well (I think).",

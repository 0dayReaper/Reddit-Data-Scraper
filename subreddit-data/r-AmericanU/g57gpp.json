Are there a lot of research opportunities for science (especially with the new building)? And how is the job market in DC?\n\nEDIT: Most likely not attending AU because of the price ($50K a year). We'll see where life takes me but thank you all so much for your help!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Very dependent on your department or major.\n\nAdditionally there are TONs of resources for jobs. The career center, department specific Twitter feeds that post jobs, etc. Those people either didn't try hard enough or didn't know where to look. Nothing is guaranteed by going to AU, but you have a strong chance of being able to make connections with some professors that still have their normal jobs on top of teaching",

Went for my statistics masters and currently work(at home) as a data analyst for a healthcare system in McPhearson Square. \n\nI\u2019d say for science, your job opportunities, whether as a TA or research position are plentiful and less competitive than some of the bigger schools(UMD), simply due to the shortage of STEM students here at AU. During my tenure at AU I worked at DMTI and was a math &amp; stats tutor there. I also worked for one of the professors as his research assistant. \n\nDC\u2019s job market for science is okay I\u2019d say, not the best, but pretty decent. Not as amazing when you think of it as the nation\u2019s capital though. What do you major in OP?  But entry level the pay is not too high. Anything high-paying here are government-related or government contractors(Booz Allen, Lockheed, Le\u00eddos). You need a security clearance for all of those, even higher if you want to go federal, and you need a company to sponsor you for all the clearances. \n\nI lucked out by working in healthcare which turned out to be a huge blessing in disguise. Not only does it not require security clearance, the job openings are increasing by the Covid-19 epidemic. So yeah, I lucked out. \n\nFeel free to DM me for more questions.",

I'm more of a STEM person than political (although I'm a huge activist I do not like arguing) which is why I'm a little wary of studying in DC. My major or career path might change though since I'm definitely not the most decisive person and my parents keep pushing me to go to med school instead.",

I have friends who are doing research with professors from physics, computer science, neuroscience, psychology, biology, chemistry, and environmental science, all of whom enjoy the work they do, and like the professors they work for. I will say tho, most of these positions aren't well advertised. While my experience is in the physics department so take this with a grain of salt, professors will usually turn to students that they already know from class or within the department. If you're really interested, make sure to introduce yourself at an office hour or two. Good professors will always take notice of initiative and keep you in the back of their mind when looking for a new research assistant. \n\nAs for job opportunities, before the pandemic DC was full of opportunities for STEM majors. While it's true that pure research doesn't pay well for the area, there are still a few opportunities at larger research institutions like Georgetown and UMD. What is true however is that the government is definitely looking for STEM majors. Again, I have STEM friends working everywhere from NASA to HHS, BLM and Interior, and unlike all the other people with poli-sci degrees, you'll have the advantage of having actually studied the science.\n\nWhile it may seem that AU is laking in STEM, we do in fact exist and have a bunch of cool opportunities for us both on and off campus.",

AU does have a pretty decent premed program (might be even better with the new building) and I personally know someone who did premed here and now going to med school at Harvard. So, yeah. With the epidemic the healthcare industry is only getting better. The healthcare system I work right now is recently acquired by Children\u2019s Nationals right now so yeah I work with healthcare professionals everyday. DC has several amazing healthcare system, Chikdren\u2019s National, Medstar, GW, Sibley, so yeah by all means do it.",

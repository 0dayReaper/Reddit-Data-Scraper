We'd like all members of the AU community to know more about the initiative, and share their ideas. Please join us for an information session about AUx2 on Tuesday, November 22 from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM in the SIS Founders Room. \n \nThe session will provide an overview of the course, share initial online learning materials, and present the draft syllabus. Discussion led by:\nAngie Chuang (SOC), AUx2 Curriculum Designer\nAndrea Brenner (CAS), Director of AUx and AUx1 Curriculum Designer\n \nIn the spirit of an inclusive and open process, we'd like all members of the AU community to attend, ask questions, and offer suggestions. We look forward to hearing your input on this new pilot course.\n \nFor more information, contact AUexperience@american.edu.

(Based the website AU posted describing the course http://www.american.edu/provost/undergrad/auexperience/aux2.cfm)\n\n \n\nAs a white, cis-gender, straight, biological male identifying person from a middle class background and conservative politically, I don\u2019t think I would take this course. First, because the material seems to be duplicative. The focus on race, sex, gender, sexual expression, and differences in physical ability are pretty well covered in any number of Women and Gender Study courses (or whatever it's being called these days) and several SPA course. It seems repetitive, to me, to have another course that teaches you how to apply those lessons to your everyday life.\n\n \n\nSecond, maybe I\u2019ve been swayed by Professor Christina Hoff Sommers and find intersectionality\u2026 shall I say\u2026 \u201cproblematic.\u201d She can put it far more succinctly than I, but if one constantly looks for a way to become the other/victim (based on sex, gender, age, physical ability, race, ethnicity, and on and on), it becomes very difficult to unite/coalesce and enact real change in a western democratic society. \n\n \n\nThat being said, if someone wants to spend time on intersectional politics, I have no issue with that particular choice. It seems like a waste of time for only a 1.5 credit, but hey, people waste time on plenty more harmful pastimes.\n\n \n\nI\u2019m really surprised by the \u201cLetter to a Former Stranger\u201d project. When I was at AU, it was gauche to reach out to one person from an identity group and ask them to represent their entire group. That sort of thing got labeled tokenism and was decried. ",

                                    "comment": "Upvoted the moment you mentioned Based Mom! . I was a bit worried when you called yourself as cis-gender. Mostly extreme progressive use that word.  It's not a real term so far as much as it originated for a German sexologist (whatever that is) in the 90s! There is no medical basis \n\nI'll say what I  more plain language than I usually do. \n\nSimilar to what you said, \n Feel free to waste time and money taking a worthless class so long as it is not required  I don't give a shit about what people identify as. I don't care about anyone's culture or religion.  The lack of caring is not out of malice or any negative emotion. I don't care about things that generally do not effect me. I care about working and progressing forward in life and the lives of others whom I can reach using my skill set.  \n\nI remember an invited speakers at my old law school told us \"If you don't see my blackness, then your missing a whole part of who I am\". I couldn't help but reply telling her know one in this room knows her and asked why I should care about her blackness when I don't even know her. The only part I care about other people is the part where cooperation exists in a common goal or purpose. \n\nAs someone who identities as ME (and an American, second), I would not take this course. I did my undergrad to acquire knowledge and skills to put me into a good position in law school. It eventually brought my to WCl. \n\nHigher education should only be for acquiring skill and not wasting time and tax dollars on these types of classes. These culture degrees means nothing. They give no marketable skills. \n\nEdit; did not proof read! Class time ",

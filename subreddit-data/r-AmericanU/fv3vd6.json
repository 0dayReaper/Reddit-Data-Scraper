            "comment": "My experience from my full semester at American has been pretty good overall. You can find parties if you want to and you\u2019ll definitely find a lot of floor parties from my experience. Just get a group of friends and you\u2019ll find a party. I\u2019m not too sure about Greek life. I\u2019ve only been to 2 things but everyone was really chill and the people I know in frats and sororities like it. \n\nI personally go into dc all the time. And some of the classes do field trips into the city depending on the class. \n\nYou can definitely find students from other schools. Mainly at the nightclubs in the city which I\u2019ve never been to but I hear are pretty fun. \n\nI love to visit the museums and national zoo on my free time. And on Sundays I go to DuPont Circle for the farmers market. And you can really find any group at AU. Joining clubs is a great way to meet new people but I made friends within yourself of getting on campus. \n\nDorms at American are pretty good. I had a few problems in my suite style dorm with ventilation but it was fixed in a timely manner. \n\nAU constantly touts being one of the top schools for internships in Congress and I think it may actually be the top right now. I know at least 2 kids who did a White House internship and one got a job there after she finished. It\u2019s easiest to get them during fall and spring since we\u2019re the only students in DC. I was able to get an internship at my county by just mentioning I go to American so it\u2019s a great internship school. \n\nI don\u2019t really know Fordham all that well but I loved American a lot. They have had some problems lately with the virus but honestly who hasn\u2019t. But they also have issues with their health center and mental health center. Both of which are being reformed over summer. And finally AUX is a God awful class but other than that I haven\u2019t had any bad experiences with professors or classes.",

            "comment": "Funny enough, I\u2019m a junior at AU and my sister is a freshman at Fordham, so I can (sorta?) speak to both experiences.\n\n - What is the party scene like at American? I heard its pretty dull, even with Greek life, is that true? What is Greek life like and is it a big part of life at American?\n\nTo echo a previous comment, Greek life is kinda dying everywhere except the biggest of state universities. AU\u2019s party scene isn\u2019t anything extraordinary, but there are actually parties pretty frequently with plenty of booze flowing if you make friends in Greek life. Most of student leadership on campus is in Greek life so at times it can seem like there\u2019s basically one circle of people in Greek life and then everyone else tags along. Overall, it\u2019s not a huge part of the AU experience - especially because the school is 55% commuter.\n\n - Do people go into DC a lot? \n\nYes, alllllll the time. This is for a few reasons. AU includes a free unlimited ride Metro pass with tuition (which is nuts, DC Metro is painfully expensive), and downtown DC has an endless supply of free stuff you can do and places you can go at all times. Clubs and bars are all Metro accessible too! Additionally, the majority of students end up getting at least one internship somewhere in the city, so they put those Metro passes to good use by commuting. People definitely take advantage of convenient access to DC.\n\n - Do students from AU, GW, and Georgetown hang at similar places? Where?\n\nEh, not really, the communities are pretty insular. Georgetown kids stay in Georgetown, GW kids have quite a good deal of stuff in their own neighborhood, and AU kids stay in either the local college town-like neighborhood (Tenleytown) or stay on campus because the shuttle can be a hassle. That being said though, the city\u2019s club/bar scene is limited to like 3 neighborhoods, so I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot of overlap there.\n\n - What are the students like and what do people like to do in the area?\n\nThe most outspoken AU students can be pretty obnoxious but they\u2019re generally fairly friendly, most people seem happy to be here. AU\u2019s neighborhood is very quiet and residential, which is good for, say, doing homework outdoors, but otherwise you have to take a 5-10 min shuttle bus/20 min walk to get to Tenleytown. That\u2019s where there\u2019s a lot of restaurants that drain our wallets, Target/Whole Foods/CVS, and the Metro. I know of people going to places downtown like the Library of Congress if they want to study off campus. There really isn\u2019t a whole lot to do in AU\u2019s area.\n\n - How are the dorms?\n\nFine, honestly. For freshmen they\u2019re basically the same layout and quality of any other freshman dorm elsewhere, you\u2019ll hear about the occasional rat or roach but it\u2019s otherwise comfortable enough. All the freshmen live in basically one giant fortress so it\u2019s easy to make friends living there. Sophomores and up can (for a higher price) get access to really, really nice and brand new housing - this is of higher quality than most apartment options that are walking distance from campus. I don\u2019t have that kinda money, so I lived in the freshman-style dorms for two years then moved to the suburbs and now commute by Metro. I have no complaints.\n\n - What are the best parts about the school and is it easy to get internships?\n\nAs inconvenient as the commute can sometimes be, I really love the location. It\u2019s nice to be in a quiet area but right next to where everything is at. Metro is crazy fast (way faster than driving) so everything is really close. \n\nI also really love the professors, at least in the School of Public Affairs. Being in DC, we manage to snag a lot of really experienced and well connected profs who bring a lot to the table.\n\nInternships abound in DC - like I said, almost everyone I know has done at least one. Finding a paid one can be more challenging but not impossible. There are so many internships for everything that this would honestly be the bottom of any list of concerns for me. AU is absolutely the right place to go if internships are a priority.\n\n - Would you recommend American or Fordham?\n\nI think it really depends what you\u2019re going for. Both have a high cost of living and are not their city\u2019s #1 most high profile school. AU\u2019s school spirit is nonexistent, campus life and culture are lacking, the food on campus is bad, and some people in your classes will annoy you. My sister has said that Fordham has more school spirit and like shared student sense of community, so there\u2019s that. But if you want the kind of opportunities and experience presented by being in DC specifically, then AU\u2019s the way to go. Honestly, both me and my sister just chose based on who offered the most aid.\n\nFeel free to shoot me a PM if you want to talk more about this!! Good luck with your selection process. I\u2019m a third year poli sci/justice &amp; law double major.\n\nEdited to fix formatting",

            "comment": "I actually was making the exact same decision you are making right now. Fordham and American were the two schools that I had a hard time choosing but in the end, I chose American. \n\nAs a foreign language major, you're in a good spot. And if you end up choosing American and living in DC, I want to recommend the [Global Language Network](https://thegln.org) which offers incredibly cheap and quality lessons in a bunch of languages to the community. Being that American is in DC, you're in prime real estate for anything related to international studies or foreign languages. Ultimately it boils down to this:\n\nAmerican: Better for politics and international/foreign &amp; cultural stuff\n\nFordham: Better for business and financial studies\n\nSeeing as your interests seem to be spread along these two things, it's your choice. As for the other questions...\n\nThe party scene is there if you know where to look. We aren't a party school and we aren't a sports school so already the atmosphere is pretty dull if that's what you're looking for. Greek Life is there but it's (perhaps thankfully) subtle. Greek Life is not at all a huge part of life at AU beyond people's personal connection to a certain frat/sorority. Some hate this, some like this; I personally like it.\n\nPeople go into DC all the time because AU students have two awesome things: an unlimited metro pass and a free shuttle from the campus to Tenleytown station (nearest metro station) which only takes 4-8 minutes. The only complaint I have with this is that the school sometimes does not have enough buses to keep up with the amount of people going into the city! DC is super easy to get around especially since the metro system is as efficient as it is. There's lots of stuff to do in DC if you're interested in food or museums. It's also pretty safe compared to NY and even a couple decades ago.\n\nSome students at AU have friends at the other universities but from what I've seen, they're mostly friends from before they moved to DC. So it's not like they met here randomly. Each school is kind of out of the way of the others so geographical midpoints where we might meet don't really exist. If you want to meet people from other campuses, it's better to just go to that neighbourhood and hang around places there. Clubs are your best bet since there aren't many aside from around Dupont Circle\n\nLuckily for us, students at AU are very diverse personality-wise, so there's a group for everyone. There are some pretty snobby people but also really friendly and outgoing people. It's impossible to characterise everyone at AU. One thing is pretty common however, and that's ambition. There are a lot of ambitious people at the school that it seems like are always working on their resume or going into a new internship. In terms of what people like to do, there are a ton of good restaurants in DC that people go to. Overpriced sometimes, sure. But not as bad as New York. If you're a museum person, DC is among London and Paris for having some of the best museums in the world. The best part? 90% of them are open to the public for free. Also you can't beat the mall. Whether going for a jog or just for a walk to clear your head, it's a great place to be.\n\nDorms can be garbage, especially if you're a first year. Letts is the worst. Try to avoid getting it. Most of the dorms directly on campus are ugly brutalist structures built in the 1960s with very little updating. Nebraska is the holy grail of dorms but that's only open to upperclassmen. \n\nThe best part is definitely living in DC and the quality of the professors, especially if you're in the IR school, SIS or the public affairs school, SPA. You're in the political epicentre of the most influential country in the world and there are many seasoned and well-trained people who come to work at AU from this sphere of life. Internships are abundant but getting them is dependent on your level of experience and/or connections. \n\nOverall I would recommend both. Like I said, Fordham is a good pick if you prefer business-related subjects. AU is good for political and international-related subjects. It's up to you to choose which are more important to you.",

            "comment": "I went to AU for undergrad and grad and I'm from the Bronx, my house is 10- 15 minutes away from Fordham. I currently live right outside of DC. DC is just as expensive as NYC rent wise, but you get more space for what you pay for in DC.  If you're from NYC I'd say leave. If it's a party scene you're looking for at AU you will find house parties or frat parties. They're not amazing, but they exist. I was in Greek life,  but its kind of slowly dying not just at AU but across the country. But it's there if you want it, if you want to ignore it you can. As for what people do, people go to parties but there has been a huge uptick in people going to clubs like Heist. I personally hate clubs,  but to each their own. But be prepared to see a bunch of people you see regularly. AU is big enough where its technically a not a \"small school\" but its small enough where you'll run into people very often whether you want to or not. Fordham has apartment parties and dorm parties but I'm not sure about Greek life. When I went into undergrad in 2015-16 the dorms were terrible. There were mice, the dorms smelled weird and AU housing and dining was extremely incompetent. I moved off into a house after 1 year. They've redone most of the freshmen dorms,  but they're still tiny. AU is a lot better when you move off campus so live there freshmen year then move off campus. Its also a lot cheaper to live off campus.  Dining at AU is also awful. Terrace Dining Room the buffet is terrible in every way and food on campus is expensive and very low quality. Fordham 100000% has AU beat on food quality, availability and affordability.  AU is also in the DC suburbs, not downtown,  so unlike Fordham there isn't a million businesses and restaurants surrounding the campus. Tenleytown is a mile away which has a lot of restaurants and you can get there by the AU shuttle. But it gets old after a few trips, and is very expensive because of the area. That also is where the metro is. The DC metro is a lot cleaner than the NYC subway,  but it does pales in comparison in terms of efficiency. NYC is 24/7 trains are 3-5 mins apart tops. DC metro closes at midnight, runs 5-10 minutes apart and the buses are abysmal. There are busses that only run once or twice an hour, so don't live far from the metro (but good luck because close to the metro = expensive). Fordham sits right on top of the metro north train station,  which will get you to Times Square in about 20 minutes. \n\nI'll warn you however I genuinely fucking hate the student body of AU. People are extremely pretentious and have a \"I'm gonna save the world complex,\" and its irritating. A lot of the friends you make freshmen year will transfer.",

I kept in touch well, so my social circle was diverse and large. It\u2019s just what you make of it.",

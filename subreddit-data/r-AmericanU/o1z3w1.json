    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman preparing to register for classes next week. Are 17.5 credits too much for my first semester? If I take 14.5...how do I graduate in 4 years? For context, I'm a CLEG major in AU Honors and I'm looking at:\n\nCORE 100 (AU Experience) 1.5\n\nCORE 106 (Complex Problems) 3\n\nHNRS 150 (Seminar) 1\n\nGOV 110 (Politics in the US) 3\n\nECON 100 (Macroeconomics) 3\n\nWRT 106 (College Writing Intensive) 3\n\nJLC 101 (Introduction to Law) 3\n\nMy advisers said I could choose between WRT 106 or JLC 101for 14.5 credits. Then they also said I could take both for 17.5. Not sure what to do. Any advice would be helpful!",

You can take 15.5 next semester by taking an HFIT course and you\u2019ll get your 30 for the year (since you\u2019re in honors I\u2019m assuming you have the same scholarship requirement that I had of 30 credits/year). Most people only take 15 per semester and that\u2019s literally exactly enough to graduate within 4 years (you want 30 per school year since you need 120 to graduate). I was super confused about the right amount to take when I started too since high school scheduling is more structured but you should/will really only be doing 15 per semester since that\u2019s all that will really be allowed without paying for extra credit hours since the vast majority of courses are 3 credits. The most I ever took was 16 credits bc of labs and I graduated on time!\n\nEdit: also if you take JLC101, I recommend prof Boyle or brown but definitely Boyle first!",

This schedule is a bit different since it\u2019s the same credit load but more classes, possible but it really is a lot for freshmen year. Unless you transferred credits from AP/Dual-credit it\u2019s probably best to take 14.5 and then one of the classes (probs Econ or writing) during the summer as one extra class. Best to take a lighter class load (and 15 hrs is honestly normal) to save your GPA and mental state.",

I earned 3 credits for my AP Lang exam which is why I\u2019m taking 1 semester of WRT 106 versus 2 semesters of college writing. So I\u2019ll definitely take 14.5 to start and try to keep it above 15 moving forward. Thank you!",

It is, however, a minor hindrance in applying for your first job, since it\u2019s such a long degree name for job hunting. It is a good conversation topic though.\n\nIn casual conversation, I say I majored in public policy, since that\u2019s largely what it is.",

I did CLEG with a business administration minor and found it to be a well rounded education that incorporates a lot of practical knowledge you miss in the poli sci track.  In any event, you're probably going to have to go to law school or get an MBA if you want to have much of a career.",

My plan was go as broad as possible in undergrad to get a little expertise in different interrelated fields along with good internships and then you have more options in grad school rather than being typecast/specialized in one thing already.",

I think the opportunity to try lots of different subject areas is a big benefit for a lot of people, but most end up focusing in one on area once they have a better sense of them. CLEG is effectively getting four minors, so if you want to focus on one area in particular you might be better off taking that as a major and then adding a double or minor to supplement instead.",

I\u2019m also in the process of getting my federal loans bumped up because I realized that they were only at the freshman capped amount but I\u2019m coming in as a Junior. Biggest take away is you are your own best advocate, do your research and keep following up.",

For reference, I\u2019m and independent student but last year I saw about a $20,000 decrease in income due to the pandemic so I qualified for low enough income to get the pell grant.",

    "postText": "Hi!\nI was recently accepted to AU as a transfer (woooo!!) and I found out they gave me no merit scholarship and I really need it to afford AU. I am awaiting my financial aid package from another school and AU but I was wondering if I could appeal for merit scholarship. I am transferring with a 4.0 from temple for context.I\u2019ve been applying to scholarships outside of university but I have not been able to get them (my gpa was not updated then). Also when did the financial aid packages get released for any other transfers? Thank you so much!!!",

            "comment": "hey!! this happened to me too! did you send in your most recent transcripts yet?? because for me, i wasn't considered for merit scholarships because i only submitted my fall transcripts and i hadn't sent my spring ones in yet. because of this, they saw that i was only transferring in with 18 credits. american doesn't consider merit unless you are transferring in with at least 24 credits. so in my case, i emailed admissions and they told me to submit my newest transcripts and then they added merit scholarships once they saw i had at least 24 credits. hope this helps!! let me know if you have any questions :)",

But my impression of what sets AU apart is that it's very professionally oriented - that's definitely true of my program, and I've read that about AU as a whole. \n\nThat and AU is literally the most liberal, and one of the most politically active, school in the US.  \n\nI would also say AU is great if you want a more suburban campus feel, in contrast to GWU which is just sort of embedded into the city. AU is also smaller than many other schools.",

    "postText": "So, I found out recently that I was accepted into the MAPA, specifically the Masters International track. I want to get as much info as possible before deciding to commit. With this end in mind, I decided to try posting here.\n\n1. What are some of the cheaper living options favored by graduate students?\n\n2. If anyone knows, how easy or hard is it to get an assistantship or a campus job to help with tuition?\n\n3. If anyone is familiar with the Anthropology department, what are some of your opinions on faculty/staff? Also, if you have experience with graduate courses here, what are some ones you would suggest?\n\nThanks for any potential help!",

            "comment": "Can't speak much to the graduate program, but if you are looking at getting an apartment relatively close to campus that would also be more inexpensive (especially if you have roommates) and you don't mind walking a bit, many of the apartment buildings by the national Cathedral have some good prices and are right by a Giant. There's also always the Berkshire, which is only a 10 minute walk from campus, but it's completely overrun with undergrads and smells like weed, natural gas, or trash most of the time",

    "postText": "We recently featured a poet from the AU creative writing MFA program on our podcast, MFA Writers. The show is meant to be a resource for prospective applicants, as well as highlight emerging writers. There's a lot of opaqueness around the MFA application process and we aim to provide greater information and transparency. The goal is to provide an opportunity to hear from real creative writing students about their experiences in their programs.\n\nIf you're interested, MFA Writers is available on all major podcasting platforms (and some minor ones, too). You're always welcome to reach out to us with feedback or program requests, as well. We want this to be an informative and useful resource for emerging writers.\n\nThanks all!",

    "postText": "I'm looking to take CSC 648 in the fall and CSC 646 was the recommended prereq.  I'm not able to take it between now and the fall, and I've been unable to find a copy of the syllabus online anywhere.  Basically, I'm looking for who the professor(s) is/are that usually teach 446/646, and a syllabus/slides/any class material/which textbook was used.  Planning on doing some self-study over the summer semester.  Thanks in advance.",

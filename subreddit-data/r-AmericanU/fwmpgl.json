I've heard that the program is new and relatively small, but they have alot of success placing graduates at big name companies in the DC area. Can anyone offer any information on the CS program at AU? :)",

The biggest industry in the DC area that hires lots of CS grads is defense and government contracting. These positions often require security clearances, so you would want to stay clean in order to be eligible.\n\nWhat's the other school you're deciding between?",

They\u2019re both relatively nascent industries however and so both can be as rewarding as you can make them out to be. The perks of the DoD side is you can have an effect on national and international security more easily than otherwise.",

If they have a subreddit, I'd go ask to see what they think of their program.\n\nI have no idea how rewarding the defense and government contracting industry is since it's not an area of personal interest for me, and I've personally never worked in it. Government contractors generally pay better than the government itself even for identical positions, and having a security clearance can increase your pay. However, salaries in SF are still higher than in DC (but positions may be more competitive).\n\nThe other commenter is right that the career services generally suck for STEM students, but you can still be successful if you are proactive, put the work in, and make yourself stand out. When I was looking for internships for next summer, I got three interviews as a result of networking at on-campus events, all for competitive positions well-known companies, and one of them gave me an offer which I accepted.\n\nThat commenter also claims that many CS students at AU graduate without really knowing how to code, which honestly matches what I've heard too. However, I've also heard that this really isn't unique to AU, and again the solution to this problem comes down to personal responsibility and being proactive.\n\nAll in all, I would probably suggest USFCA simply because it's in SF, not knowing anything about it other than that it's in SF and not a tech school. But I would do more research, and ultimately, I'm sure you can be successful at either school if you are willing to put in the work to make it happen.",

AU has been really advertising that a sizable amount of their grads get placed in big name companies (ie. Google, NASA) is this consistent with what you saw? Personally, DC is a little closer to the environment that I would like to live in, and is A LOT closer to home, but I also realize there might be a significant amount more opportunities in San Francisco. Do you think that there is a specific lack of job opportunities in DC, or just less compared to SF?\n\nThanks again for the information :)",

A couple from one year went to AWS, but as cloud support. A lot of people go to Geico, some random NGOs in the area, or do IT work. The most \"prestigious\" places people went to were microsoft and github, but these were analmolies. \n\nThe tech scene in DC is not very good for developers compared to SF. Everything is government or government adjacent, minus Amazon and Capital One. Lots of news companies if you're into that. The pay is the area lower due to government and government contractors versus what you'll find in SF.\n\nYes, if you hustle and work your ass off you can do anything, but it's just not worth the insane tuition and low quality of classes. There are one or two gems of professors, but a lot of the good ones are adjunct that last a year and leave.",

Programming languages, AI, and operating systems were weak as well. Networks, web development, and that class with circuits and assembly were definite highlights.\n\nOne of my quips is CS is supposed to be challenging. I definitely struggled a lot, but the difficulty curve at AU was just so low. Like professors not even checking code to see if it compiles or not even looking at capstones. Hell people got grade boosts for making powerpoints about starcraft for one class.\n\nAnother is no guidance from the school or help professionally. The alumni network for CS is very small and the ones at Google, Facebook, YouTube, etc are not software engineers but legal staff, marketing, business, etc. The career fair had one or two companies looking for CS interns, while if you go to somewhere like UMD you get hundreds.\n\n The interview process for software engineers are very unique to the field, but kids aren't really prepped or told unless they hear from other classmates, which makes them uncompetitive in internships/jobs for good tech companies even if they get interviews.\n\nThere are a lot of smart kids who worked really hard, but the school combined with it's lack of resources and the faculty made it just feel subpar versus the gen ed classes I would take from SIS, Kogod, or SPA. I think AU is fantastic for certain majors and career paths, just not good for others like CS.",

I\u2019d say while the STEM scene at AU is not pretty good, it\u2019s less competitive and it\u2019s easier to stand out. I received a lot of research opportunities at AU when I was attending and that helped me land my current job in 1.5 months after graduation. I now work as a data analyst at downtown Dc. \n\nI know a couple of CS people while working at Don Myers. Some were doing pretty well I would say. I know a girl who did internship for DHS and is heading for her grad program. I also know a guy who is currently working at Amazon. AU\u2019s CS program also has produced alumni like Michael Chasen(founder of Blackboard) and Bruce Schneier(famous cyber security expert). I believe the founder of Mapbox is also from AU(?). \n\nAlso, never been to SF, but know a lot of people living there. All of them consider USF the butt of the joke in the area. Schools like UCSD, Berkeley easily blow it out of the water. So I\u2019d say while it\u2019s located in SF, it doesn\u2019t have the best of reputation. I\u2019d say its reputation is on par with UCR(they call it UC rejects). \n\nAlso the other post is right, in DC the CS jobs are limited and unless you have years of experience with security clearance your job opportunities are limited. Definitely consider healthcare I would say. I currently work in healthcare and it\u2019s a growing business due to Covid-19 and most of the jobs do not require security clearance. \n\nChoose either of the school that saves you the most money and based on your preference. If u prefer living in Dc, then come to AU. If not, then go to the Bay.",

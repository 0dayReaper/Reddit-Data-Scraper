    "postText": "Hi ! I\u2019m a recently accepted AU undergrad who deferred their admission to fall 2022. \n\nThis question might be far-fetched for this subreddit but as a person with several food allergies (eosinophilic esophagitis) I\u2019ve been looking at AU\u2019s dining options. \n\nIs there any official menu online ? And I\u2019m aware of a special circumstances allergy related form that is applicable to such a situation but, I\u2019m still scrounging around anyways. Or even if any current students had any insight on if there are gluten/dairy free menus available. I\u2019d even appreciate any menu items you\u2019re aware of at the top of your head lol. \n\nThanks again !",

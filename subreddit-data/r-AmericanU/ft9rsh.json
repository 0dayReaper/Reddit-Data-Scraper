    "postText": "I'm finishing my freshman year at GW and because of changes to housing costs it looks like I'm not going to be able to come back next year. I know the transfer deadline is coming up and I've kind of last minute decided to apply to AU in addition to my state school. I love DC but I don't love GW. Besides my friends and some professors I haven't found a lot of positives, the administration doesn't care about non-wealthy students and there's not many opportunities for being social unless you're a greek or on the exec board of a student org. Being in the middle of the city isn't a huge deal to me seeing as you have to metro to get to most places anyway. I'm applying as a communications major and I just wanted any information people could give me on the quality of financial aid, the communications program specifically, and the campus feel in general seeing as I'm not going to be able to visit. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Can't comment exactly on the financial aid aspect since that depends on the student's individual background, but what I can say is that it's not bad but also not too generous. I'm in SIS (the IR school) but from what I've seen, the communications programme seems to be pretty good and AU is in a good place in terms of resources for it. We have our own TV channel and radio station for example and the friends I've spoken to that are in SOC told me that they really enjoy it.\n\nA lot of people from both inside and outside AU have mixed feelings about the campus. IMO, AU is a good middle point between GW and Georgetown when it comes to the general feel of the campus. Like Georgetown, we sorta have our own neighbourhood (Tenleytown) and it's great to be away from the congested city centre and just hang around. But like GW and unlike Georgetown, we're still pretty connected to the city. Geographically, we're pretty far, but Tenleytown has a train station and AU provides free shuttle services from the campus directly to the station every 6-10 minutes and the ride is usually around 5 minutes. \n\nI visited GW and I have to say that I wasn't a big fan. I think you know what I mean when I say that GW doesn't really have a campus. AU is the exact opposite. The campus is like its own town and to me, this is why I chose AU in the end over other DC schools. We have lots of residential space, two convenience stores open until 2am, a cafeteria, a Starbucks, a Subway, and other AU-sponsored food options. Socially, Greek life is present but it definitely doesn't dominate how people make friends and I'd say it's even kind of weak compared to other universities. There are still pretentious people at AU but not that many and I suspect that's because not as many people are as career-driven. Most here are middle to upper middle class with quite a few upper class kids sprinkled in but they're not that big portion-wise. This comment is way longer than I intended but I hope it helps.",

Even the so-called \"mediocre\" professors in SIS are still pretty good. Again, I don't feel comfortable giving my opinion on the curriculum or faculty as I expect this to be quite different for graduates vs undergrads but so far as administration is concerned, it's pretty efficient and they're very accessible.",

            "comment": "If u find it more economical and the administration at AU is more generous with scholarship, by all means do it. GW is on the same tier with AU. The only advantages they have over AU is their engineering and med school. \n\nI also like the AU campus better. I work part-time as a math &amp; stats tutor and a lot of my clients/students are from GW. They\u2019re right in the MIDDLE of the city, with patrol cars, ambulances, office workers, homeless people. They don\u2019t have a quad or any public place for students other than in front of Gelman(??). The location attracts the wrong type of people too. When I was tutoring at SEAS, I saw a homeless guy washing up in their bathroom. Their internet also sucked, either GWireless or GWConnect. \n\nAU is pretty quiet, we have our own campus/neighborhood and it\u2019s very accessible to downtown where the hustle is. When I was at AU I went downtown for the cherry blossom festivals and the World Series. All you have to do is to take a free shuttle(5-8 mins) and redline(20-25 mins) and that\u2019s it. Plus AU gives us a free metro upass(best thing I liked about AU) so we can take limitless metro rides for free during a semester, even though we do have to pay $120 more in tuition, but that\u2019s more than worth it. Remeber, we can go anywhere not just in Dc, but the entire DMV area. I can easily have access to Rockville, Arlington, Silver Spring, Alexandria with the UPass. It helped me a lot when I was going to these places for interviews. \n\nIf AU is more economical for you, by all means do it.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m going to be a freshman in college next year and I\u2019m thinking about applying to AU on a pre med track. I know most of the people there are in political science or government majors so I am wondering if they\u2019re good for pre med. Are there lots of good programs and opportunities there for pre med students?",

AU\u2019s got lots of research, study abroad, and internship opportunities. Not to mention the cou tell hospitals, medical research companies, etc around the region.",

It is definitely normal for not every person to have the same experience, but I think I\u2019ll trust the University that\u2019s been around in DC for a century and has rankings, outcome statistics, Med school admission statistics and much more on their side. Sorry you didn\u2019t have a great experience though.",

Which a matter of fact you do nothing in except for your bio lab. Also your bio lecture is gonna be in a dusted old building in the back of the campus in the basement. Classes are small professors aren\u2019t good; departments are small, the school doesn\u2019t fund the sciences as much as there other departments. Not a lot of people are also in sciences you\u2019ll find yourself at some points feeling lonely because well there\u2019s not a lot of science majors. Tuition isn\u2019t worth it at all for this lack of support. I\u2019m transferring because of this wasted my time; any state school or any other school should be good than AU take my advice as a pre med student myself do not go here.",

We don\u2019t have programs to brag about but the teachers so far have been really great and there are plenty of internship opportunities around DC. Also DC is just a great\n city. Not many people you run into are science majors but my classes are full and it\u2019s kinda nice to bond over the niche majors. Some schools have really shaky programs but the teachers have been here for years and years so they\u2019re good at what they do. TLDR our program isn\u2019t something to brag about but I think it\u2019s pretty good",

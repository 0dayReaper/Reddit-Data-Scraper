    "postText": "Hey yall!, I just got accepted into AU for the class of '26 as a global scholar!\n\nI've been reading a lot about AU, and many people say that they are majoring in \"International Relations,\" but I never seem to find that as an undergraduate major in the SIS. Are the terms \"International Relations\" and \"International Studies\" used interchangeably by the AU community? \n\nIn my understanding, these two majors are different, and I would really appreciate it if someone can explain to me if that is the case at AU! :)\n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "The AU bachelor's degree [is named International Studies](https://www.american.edu/sis/undergrad/program-details.cfm). People sometimes use them interchangeably because IR/IS aren't that clearly distinguished when it comes to the [name of the field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations), and IR is a more common bachelor's degree at other universities. But AU does not have separate IR and IS majors at the undergraduate level.",

In a broader sense, it concerns all activities between states\u2014such as war, diplomacy, trade, and foreign policy\u2014and relations with and among other international actors, such as intergovernmental organisations (IGOs), international non-governmental organisations (INGOs), international legal bodies, and multinational corporations (MNCs).

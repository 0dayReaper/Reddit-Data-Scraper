People with discriminatory views are generally ostracized or feel the need to keep those views to themselves, which I think may drive some crazies to act out.  \n\nWhen (still certainly rare) examples of hate speech do occur, they often draw widespread condemnation across the \"politically active\" student body which can have a bit of a spotlight effect.  \n\nAt AU just like in the rest of the world discrimination can be very real, but characterizing it as noticeably worse then at peer institutions may not be fully correct.  I'm not currently an AU student but I doubt things have changed that much.\n\nI'm sure experiences vary, but I would not characterize the community as \"toxic for muslim girls.\"",

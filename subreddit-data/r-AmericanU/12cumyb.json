    "postText": "Is the Berkshire really as bad as some reviews make it seem? Especially the roach and pest problem? I\u2019d like honest recent takes, not complaints from years and decades ago. Management claims the situation has improved greatly with the recent renovations but is that accurate? I don\u2019t expect them to be like, yeah roaches are running the place lol. Closeness to campus is a priority for me. I\u2019m a rising junior looking to rent a studio.",

It may have just been the floor I was on. \n\nAlthough to get any decent response from management I essentially had to threaten legal action. It then took almost a year to get my security deposit back. \n\nI ended up renting a room in a house in the area. I was able to get out of the lease after I threatened to sue.",

It's walkable to campus, very safe and the amenities are great (gym in the building, common rooms/work spaces, convenience store/deli in the basement). My only complaint is the cost, but it's DC so....",

    "postText": "Hey AU peeps,\n\nI have recently been severed from my university dodgeball club in Rochester due to adulting(finished grad school), and now I'm in D.C., lamenting the sorry state of public dodgeball leagues.  Out of the two I've found, one plays on squash courts(whyyyyy) and one cancelled and switched me into kickball without my permission.\n\nI am limited in what can be found on google without logging in to the intramural/club system for each university, so any help getting in contact with a hypothetical dodgeball club would be much appreciated.  So, I am reaching out here, to see if:\n\n1.  Your university has an active dodgeball club\n\n2.  The space the club uses is open to the public(at U of Rochester, students can guest-pass friends in for something like 3 bucks per visit, for instance)\n\n3.  The club members would be willing to tolerate a 31 year old skinny little moron chucking balls at them.\n\nI am willing to pay club fees and will sign waiver forms.",

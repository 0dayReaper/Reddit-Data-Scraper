On campus food has some decent options but TDR (the dining hall) is generally not great though it's fine for some days. Off campus food in DC nearby is good but it requires spending money. Many freshman live off subway. \n\nLocation: Great. DC is beautiful and if you're in SPA or SIS it's the perfect place to go to college. Definitely has some downsides in terms of the city dying at night way earlier than other cities, but overall it's a great city.  \n\nDorms: Mixed. Letts is decently gross but I look back on my time there with a lot of fondness despite the grossness. The other dorms are fine and some of the sophomore ones are even nice.",

I tried logging in with it, but it said there wasn\u2019t an application attached to it. Of course not, because I haven\u2019t applied yet. How is this? What do I do with the code? Won\u2019t tuneup just give me a new one when I apply? This is kinda strange.",

The negative will hurt you more than the good will but keeping a professional impression will be better than the bad interactions.",

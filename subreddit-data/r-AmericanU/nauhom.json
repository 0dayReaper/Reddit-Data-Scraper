            "comment": "I teach in this program so am obviously biased. But here's a few things about it:\n\n* It's mostly geared towards students without a CS bachelor's degree (you do need to know how to program though).\n* Partly because of that, and partly because the MS program is small, most of the classes are joint 400-level/600-level classes, with upper-level undergrads in the 4xx section and MS students in the 6xx section. The lectures are the same but the 6xx section may have different homeworks/projects/exams.\n* As a result, it might feel redundant if you did a CS undergrad, e.g. if you already took an equivalent to a 400-level operating systems class, the AU 600-level one might have lectures that are too similar to what you already took. But if you didn't do CS undergrad, I think it can be a good way to get an MS without feeling behind compared to students who already have a bachelor's in the subject.\n* One plus for MS students is that the CS department doesn't currently have a PhD program. That can make it easier to get involved with faculty research compared to larger departments where faculty mainly work with PhD students.",

I had some worries coming from a non-CS background, but it actually sounds like a great program for someone like me. The opportunity to take part in research as a master's student is also exciting.\n\nIf you wouldn't mind a follow up question: are the classes in general (or just the classes you teach) heavily project-based, or would you say they're more exam-based? My other concern as someone without a CS bachelor's is that I wouldn't be ready for a career in CS at the end of the program.",

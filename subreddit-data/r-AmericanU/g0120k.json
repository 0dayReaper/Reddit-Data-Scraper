    "postText": "Hi there! I\u2019m pretty indecisive between going to American University or University of Miami. These are the big reasons I like and dislike both schools- any thoughts or advice that anyone has would be awesome! \n\nAmerican is really great because I want to major in International Relations. This is obviously an incredible program at AU and the connection to DC would be really valuable. I also got into the Honors Program which I really like so overall I think from an education standpoint it would be a fantastic option. However, I have some hesitations. I get cold really easily and don\u2019t love the weather of Washington DC. I\u2019m also really looking for a sense of community and school spirit, and I get the sense that AU doesn\u2019t have that as much as other schools, especially with the lack of sports. Basically, I feel like the cold weather and somewhat bland campus buildings don\u2019t really promote the community and vibe I really am looking for. \n\nMiami, on the other hand, I feel like totally has the community I love. It has really great weather, people seem to spend a lot of time outside, and I appreciate the overall vibe and spirit, especially with sports. I also really like the city of Miami and it could certainly help with my want to bring Spanish into my education and career. However, the IR program isn\u2019t really as stand-out. It does have an International Studies major and Ecosystem Policy major that both interest me, but neither are as known as American\u2019s School of International Service. So I\u2019m slightly concerned about how much that degree would cost for what it would be worth. However, if I decide I want to go into a different major, I feel like Miami probably has some more options. And if I stick to IR, at the moment I really want to go to grad school, and think I could probably go to a more specialty program at that time. \n\nAlthough American would be slightly cheaper, it isn\u2019t a massive difference, just a slight consideration. \n\nThank you so much for any help!!",

            "comment": "Assuming money isn't an issue for you, AU is a no-brainer for IR. Miami isn't really respected for its education and job market. It's known as a tourist hub, that's it. I've been to Miami several times and find the weather to be severely overrated. While there is no cold, there is enough hurricane and rain to offset the benefits of the hot weather. That is to say, I still love Miami, but you should not decide the school based on criteria, especially for DC. \n\nDC weather is not that cold compared NYC, Boston, Philly, etc. We're basically in Virginia, and in case you don't know, Virginia is considered the South geographically. While there is cold, and there are snow, the weather is not as severe as say the Midwest, Upper East Coast, Northeast etc. The weather here in DC is like a child's temper, it can bounce from 30s to 80s within a week. There is no predicting DC weather. Snow is almost a non-factor here. I think it only snowed like 5 times when you add up last year and this year and most of the time the snow is too little to even accumulate. I went to Midwest for my undergrad, and trust me, I know. \n\nSchool spirit is really overrated. It should not be a factor when you choose your school. For a city school, I'd say AU has one of the best school spirits, especially compared to GW and NYU. We do have a traditional (albeit small) campus and our students are very passionate. You can find fraternity/sorority and orgs everywhere on the Quad. AU students also have a pretty strong sense of community. We DO follow our sports. Our women's volleyball team just won the patriot league last year and our Men's basketball team came was the 2nd seed. While we don't have a super strong sports culture, it's by no means weak. Last I checked Umiami isn't really that stellar on sports either so I'd say the culture is what you made of it. I find AU students wearing school apparels (me included) everywhere when I walked on campus. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe connections and the location that AU gives you cannot be underestimated. Like I said, if you want to do IR, there's nowhere better to do than AU. AU's SIS is on par with JHU, Northwestern's calibre so yeah you'll have a easier time finding internships and jobs. I went to AU for my master's in statistics and got a job two months after graduation working in downtown DC at McPHearson Square. \n\nI'd say finance and economics should be a factor in choosing schools, school spirits, campus are super overrated. The friends you make at a big state school will eventually drift apart after years, part of it it's because the campus is too big, part of it it's because people have graduated, transferred, but yeah, friends in college usually don't stick together for long.",

            "comment": "I am currently attending AU as a grad student at SIS (International Peace and Conflict Resolution program). I went to Ohio State for my undergrad which has a *huge* sense of school spirit. \n\nWhen I first moved out to DC after graduating, I did have some regrets. All of my IR peers had had jobs and internships with DC orgs in the field. Plus they knew the city and had connections. I couldn't help getting that \"what if\" feeling.\n\nHowever, I've been out for 5 years now and I can't bring myself to regret my decision. Yes, I'm not where I want to be in my career (there are other reasons to account for most of that) but those four years at OSU were *so fun*. I got to try out a bunch of different things and experience many things I wouldn't have been able to if I hadn't gone there.\n\nI'm sure AU has some good stuff for undergrads. But it's certainly not the same from what I can tell. \n\nWill AU be a better start for a career in IR? Definitely. Will you be happier? Who can say. Go with your gut on that.",

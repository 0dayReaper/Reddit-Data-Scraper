    "postText": "I got offered admission for the fall semester of 2020. I might request a deferral. If I do, do I have to pay the full tuition before starting ? Or I can submit it the year of starting. \nAnd are there any costs I will have to pay if I change my mind after saying yes to AU\u2019s admissionv \nThanks!",

And how would you get home if you got ill in the US? Some countries probably won\u2019t take infected passengers on flights, even if you are a citizen there.\nAU won\u2019t announce online until it is certain, but I would expect that AU will try to be in-person, but have a great number of classes online. Many AU professors are older and have pre-existing conditions, and current guidelines seem to indicate that no university can send those faculty back into in-person classes (without their consent). I expect AU will strongly consider single occupancy dorm rooms (many universities already made this a policy)- but a final decision on all wouldn\u2019t be announced for more than a month, at best. My advice is find something you would love to do with your very high potential \u201cgap year\u201d.",

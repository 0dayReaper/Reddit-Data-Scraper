Felt like the author was pushing a bias to go against this new convention while trying to come across as neutral, so that's pretty shitty.\n\nI grew up in a low income urban environment where minorities were the majority. I've read plenty of papers from classmates that weren't up to \"standards\". Came to college, read papers from classmates who clearly grew up at least middle class. They still had plenty of problems in their writing, but the clear difference was that grammar and conventions were less so the issue. \n\nIt's difficult to instill these conventions into low income minority groups when the biggest concern is to make sure they even manage to get through high school without dropping out in the first place. When that's the bar that's set, the straight A student that leaves to college from there still has so much to catch up on. \n\nI think it's great that they are identifying the issue for professors.

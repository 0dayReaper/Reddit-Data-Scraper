    "postText": "Do any US universities offer distance education undergrad programs like BA/BS? I'm not talking about \"online\" programs popularized recently by startups like Udacity but proper degree programs.\n\n\nAre these programs available internationally? Can someone from India apply to a US university that offer such a program?\n\nAlso, will a person with such a dergee be eligible for H1B US Visa?\n\n#.\n#.\n##EDIT: \n\nOr any University from anywhere in the world that offer an internationally recognized undergrad that can be pursued 100% from distance and that makes one eligible for H1B Visa in the western world.\n\n\n#.\n#.\n### Long Story: \n\nI dropped out of college and never completed my Bachelor's degree. I was very good with Computer Science and immediately received offers from a lot of software companies in India despite not having a degree. I've worked for over 3 years now as a software engineer and have also contracted for some US firms. Recently, I've been receiving some offers from some US companies who would like to hire me as a Software Engineer but unfortunately they are not able to sponsor my Visa application as a Bachelor's degree is a hard requirement for the H1B Visa. So I was thinking about enrolling in a distance education course from some western university (preferably US) that enables me to get the H1B visa.",

            "comment": "Common questions:\r  \nQ: I can't make it to every practice, can I still join the club?\r  \nA: YES! The cardio kickfit classes are designed as a cardio class with taekwondo skills, so you will always be welcome to jump into those. The Tuesday/Friday Taekwondo classes will teach curriculum you will eventually need to know to test for your next belt, but you can test when you are ready (belt tests are commonly at the end of the semester).\n\n\r  \nQ: What should I wear to practice?\r  \nA: For now, athletic clothing is great. If you have a dobok/uniform, feel free to wear it. We will do a club order for uniforms and gear in a couple of weeks. \n\n\r  \nQ: I did a different style of martial art, what belt level will I start at?\r  \nA: Please talk to the coaches. We encourage everyone without a background in World Taekwondo (WT) to consider starting at white belt to learn the WT style and the AU curriculum, but are open to a discussion. Those with previous experience can often test more rapidly.\n\n\r  \nQ: What type of competition will we do?\r  \nA: We practice WT, Kukkiwon, Olympic-style sparring and poomsae. We compete in a local east coast mid-atlantic collegiate league against schools like Virginia Tech, UVA, UNC, Duke, William &amp; Mary. Our first tournament is tentatively scheduled for October 30 at UNC Chapel Hill.",

The fees go toward club defraying some costs (equipment, uniforms, tournament fees, social events) but are much more affordable than your typical commercial dojang fees (upwards of $150-200/month).",

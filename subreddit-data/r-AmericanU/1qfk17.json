    "postText": "Helloo, I am a third year college student. I have recently applied to AU as a transfer student for the fall of 2013. Unfortunately, I did not get accepted but I also did not get rejected either. They have sent me a letter explaining that I should part take in non-degree student. Although i love to, it is very expensive for me. So, one of the KoGod advisor consulted me to go to NOVA and take specific classes for a year and reapply for the fall of 2014. I was wondering if any of the AU student had a similar experience! Thank you ",

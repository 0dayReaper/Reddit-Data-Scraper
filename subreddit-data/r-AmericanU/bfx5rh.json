    "postText": "Hello there! I'm considering attending American University, but after \nbrowsing the American subreddit for a bit, I'm not so sure anymore. I attended an AU Day Visit recently and thought that place was spectacular, I loved the architecture and the class that I got to sit in. \n\nI wanted to ask if the issues at AU were as disturbing as they were made out to be? In particular, feedback on the state of dormitories (considering the numerous complaints about rodent problems and the bathrooms) would be appreciated! I've also read that the food at American is awful, but I don' think that's huge enough of an issue to affect my decision? Figure I'll tough through or buy meals elsewhere or think of an alternative. There has also been issues with the financial aid department, but AU's financial department already basically told me to go fuck myself so, I suppose I won't have to talk with them all that much for a bit.\n\nOther than that, what do you think are the biggest issues about American? If you could choose all over again, would you still choose American? Do you think American's positives make up for its flaws?\n\nEdit: Thank you for all your responses!",

            "comment": "You'll probably get an edgy response to a question like this, but worst traits? In my opinion, it's the price. And that critique goes to most schools of higher learning atm. I was raised to never be comfortable spending so much, even if it isn't my money being spent. \n\nFood isn't really bad at all. It's pretty average stuff that you're likely to find at any random college campus. Again, my critique was the price tho, so I cook my own food these days. \n\nProbably the shittiest thing you'll have to deal with is certain campus renovations as they try to modernize the piping that runs under campus (and build a new building).\n\nOh, and rodent troubles are something you won't escape so long as you're living in a place that houses hundreds of different people with different lifestyles. That's pretty much luck of the draw. \n\nI've had minimal complaints over the past 3 years. Going into my senior year now, and if I was given the choice to do it all over (assuming I also lost all the knowledge and experience I gained), it'd probably take me several do-overs to get things just right because all of my issues have nothing to do with the college I chose.\n\nThe most valuable thing to me is the people I've come to know. I know them because they also happened to choose this college during the time that I chose it. This is the positive that outweighs any nonsense I run into. You can find this anywhere, and I hope you do, wherever you choose to go!\n\nI'd be happy to answer any specific questions.",

The dorms aren\u2019t great (I\u2019ve never had any pest problems) and the food isn\u2019t good (although that might change since the food service provider is switching), but the actual schooling is, in my experience, really wonderful. Every one of my professors has been dedicated, experienced, and knowledgeable. I generally like the student body, and the campus itself, as you said, is beautiful, plus the rest of DC is accessible. Idk, I think the school gets a bad rap sometimes in the subreddit, and it for sure has it\u2019s issues and you should take them into account, but I\u2019ve been really happy with my choice.",

The dining hall is NOT the only option for food, and even then, it is very good for college dining and makes a very apparent effort to serve new and different things. Also, the freshman dorms are NOT bad. Anderson hall specifically has just been renovated and it is VERY nice- for example, I lived there and had the nicest dorm building out of everyone I knew at other schools, by far. The complaints you\u2019re hearing are coming from people who feel passionate enough to come on reddit and complain but, they really, really are not making an accurate portrayal of the school. I have had a wonderful experience here.",

            "comment": "Overpriced degrees for low-paying sectors. The academics are great for certain majors and absolute trash for others. AU also doesn't have much name recognition outside the DMV, and it is looked on as third place behind GU and GW. Dorms are pretty standard, though they do have a lot of storage space. Rodents are a problem on a few floors, but overall it's way played up. Food is standard for a college campus, which means it sucks. Barely any dining options at night; hope you like eating Subway 7 days a week.\n\nIn general, most people hate the administration but enjoy their program if it's one of the good ones. I'm in SIS, and I'm very satisfied with the quality of my courses and professors. I also really like my classmates. The school doesn't have a lot of heated competition between students like you see at GU.\n\nThe school really isn't that politically active, more politically oriented. People talk about politics a lot, and the school is overall very, very liberal in a typical \"white people from the Northeast\" kind of way. But the student body at AU is genuinely pretty diverse.\n\nParty scene is wack imho. Tons of binge drinking and also weird, childish competition between frats/sororities. There's also a very weird culture of being outwardly sex-positive but not actually following that at all. Sexual assault is a recurring issue in several frats. Most of the sororities are bulimia factories. The social scene is one of the weak points of AU imo, but if you put yourself out there you'll be fine.\n\nI don't regret going to AU, but I also don't think it's the best school in the world. AU is absolutely what you make of it. Do your homework, go to class, don't take yourself too seriously, and you'll be fine.",

            "comment": "&gt;In particular, feedback on the state of dormitories (considering the numerous complaints about rodent problems and the bathrooms) would be appreciated!\n\nBad, but getting better. I've had very little issues with rodents (keep your room clean!). Bathrooms aren't a huge issue, but some people are slobs. Though, I'm male so the like 10 guys on our floor share the same sized bathroom as the like 40 girls. \n\n&gt;I've also read that the food at American is awful, but I don' think that's huge enough of an issue to affect my decision? Figure I'll tough through or buy meals elsewhere or think of an alternative.\n\nTDR isn't *that* bad as its palatable, but little variety and not the best cleanliness standards. Aramark has a habit of closing down food options with no notice (i.e. every spring finals season), but they are getting kicked out. At this point, it's impossible to predict what food is gonna be like next year.\n\nI wouldn't recommend thinking you can buy food elsewhere or have an alternative. Cooking food in communal lounges is a pain and there aren't that many food places near campus.  \n\n&gt;here has also been issues with the financial aid department, but AU's financial department already basically told me to go fuck myself so, I suppose I won't have to talk with them all that much for a bit.\n\nA lot of people complain about them, I've found them helpful except when I'm trying to get more money. \n\n&gt;Other than that, what do you think are the biggest issues about American?\n\nAn administration that is incompetent. They don't give a fuck about helping students. This school has sucked my soul out over the past two years through constantly just being incompetent. Rooms that reach 80+ for weeks straight because facilities is surprised that it warms up in the spring. Having parking threaten to boot my car because they consistently mis-read my license plate. Being told that I'm stuck with my drug-dealing roommate that keeps the lights on 24/7 and loudly practices his foreign language at all hours. Being told there's no merit aid for a current student, even with a 3.98 GPA who has completed 3 years of coursework in 2. Being told that they let all the rising sophomores register early for the nice split sophomore/upperclassmen dorm, leaving 0 rooms to upperclassmen. Not having an advisor for months on end. \n\n&gt;If you could choose all over again, would you still choose American?\n\nNo. This school has truly sucked the life out of me. \n\n&gt;Do you think American's positives make up for its flaws?\n\nNo. But that's not to say AU doesn't have good parts. The professors are amazing across departments. (I've had maybe one bad professor out of 25ish professors) The location is amazing. The campus is not the prettiest (buildings are meh and old, pathways could be improved, less construction would be nice), but it's a nice secluded campus still in a big city. We have a quad and a full campus, unlike many city schools like NYU, GW, Columbia, DePaul, etc. And, I've probably had a worse than average experience. There are people that love it here.\n\nBut I think you are asking the right questions, at the end of the day what matters is if people regret their mistake. And I do.",

I would lose about half of my credits if I transferred. And at this point, I've only got a year left (graduating in 3). I need a very compelling financial reason (i.e. salary) to transfer, which means getting a degree from a top school. But those top school don't accept many transfers, especially from 4 year institutions. \n\n\nAlso, transferring in general is a huge pain in the ass. But it really says something that I am very close to being ready to transfer to a similar school outcome wise and lose half my credits.",

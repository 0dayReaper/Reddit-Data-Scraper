    "postText": "Hi everyone, I'm an incoming freshman at AU. I was wondering about the policy/attitude towards COVID on campus. Are people still living like its 2020 and centering their lives around COVID? Are the restrictions from the administration reasonable? Also has AU gone online at all this year and how would you rate the administration\u2019s handling of the pandemic.",

            "comment": "With an exception of a few weeks in March and April, AU has had a mask mandate for the year. We went online for a few weeks in January, but so did many or the east coast city schools so take that as you will. I personally think the restrictions are pretty reasonable, but I will 100% admit I am more covid cautious than most college students (I still mask indoors regardless of mandates around me as I haven\u2019t gotten covid yet). Most people on campus are pretty ambivalent towards it, though as previously mentioned there are vocal people on both sides of the issue.  Overall, I wouldn\u2019t say the administration\u2019s decisions have been great but I don\u2019t think what they\u2019ve done is to far out of league from other admins (baring the last few weeks potentially, but we are in line with other schools in the DMV area). My personal gripe is the fast, extreme flip-flopping on responses rather than the response itself.",

            "comment": "It\u2019s a mixed bag in terms of feeling. The general attitude of students seems to be \u201cNo mandate? No mask.\u201d I\u2019ll give you my personal pros and cons as a grad student.\n\nPros: \n- everyone wears masks when they\u2019re required and they wear them correctly\n- there\u2019s no judgement for people who wear masks outside of the mandates\n- we sincerely have so few covid cases on campus it\u2019s amazing (though this plays into one of my cons about things being good vs when they\u2019re bad)\n- The precautions work bc I\u2019ve been in class with someone who had covid and due to spacing and masks it was fine\n- you don\u2019t have to wear a mask in the coffee shops so there are some places on campus that are \u201c\u201d\u201dnormal\u201d\u201d\u201d (I\u2019m sure they\u2019re usually busy but like\u2026it\u2019s telling why it\u2019s so full when no one there is wearing a mask)\n- they provide free on campus testing\n\nCons:\n- I hate working out in a mask so I don\u2019t use the gym\n- I can\u2019t focus on work I don\u2019t want to do with a mask on so I rarely go on campus to work \n- I\u2019m still miffed I had to get my booster bc I wasn\u2019t planning on it at all\n- There\u2019s no consistency in the response at all so I got a last minute email over winter break saying classes were online for all of February (despite promises they\u2019ll be in person) and the quality of the classes reflected the last-minute nature of the decision\n- they\u2019re slow to change policy when things are good!! I think this one irritates me the most. I\u2019m okay wearing a mask when things are bad, but when things are good, why are we requiring masks for a fully vaxxed and boosted student body in one of the most highly vaxxed areas of the country?\n\nI\u2019d say they\u2019re doing their best but it feels lazy and uninformed most of the time. They err on the side of safety though which I can appreciate.",

Administration doesn't do anything, just follows whatever Georgetown does in terms of policy. Anytime restrictions get eased, a large portion of the student body gets outraged and demands they be reimposed. Yet thats only on campus, where they have to keep up their social justice personas... off campus the pandemic never existed lol.",

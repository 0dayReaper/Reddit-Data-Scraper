    "postText": "I recently got accepted into both GWU and AU with similar scholarships, but I only got into into the AU honors program and waitlisted for GWU\u2019s. Does being part of the honors program greatly affect your college experience and professional opportunities at either of these colleges - in other words, should it be a major part of my decision? Thanks for taking the time to help me out!",

Im sure you could have a zoom chat with professors from those programs to get more of your questions answered. Either way congratulations!!",

As mentioned above all my HC friends went on to grad school and had their applications significantly enhanced by the HV designation. So knowing your medium to long term goals could help.",

There are benefits in those programs that can lead to unique research, networking, and professional opportunities that you otherwise wouldn\u2019t be offered - so that is exciting. Still, there\u2019s more work and high expectations that come with those programs, so you luv should be motivated. I know it\u2019s not binding to participate in AU\u2019s program so you can also choose to not participate in the program and still attend AU.",

    "postText": "Hello! I am a student at the University of Notre Dame, and I am currently working on my thesis, \u201cWelfare of Gender-Nonconforming Students\u201d. This project will use a short survey and optional follow-up interview to compare the welfare of gender nonconforming students at Christian and secular colleges. I am posting here today in hopes that you might be able to assist me with distributing the survey. More specifically, would you be able to suggest any individuals at your school\u2019s Student Government and LGBTQ+ organizations that I should contact about the survey? If so, how can I reach them? Thank you for reading, and have a wonderful day.",

The program coordinator and the assistant program coordinator both worked at SoundCloud, and there are *tons* of connections through both of them. Also, there's an audio tech major/minor you should look into! The campus has a record label that you can work with as well. If you're interested in music, I don't think there's a better program for you. Also, as a requirement at Kogod, you have to do at least one internship, so by the time you graduate you'll already have at least some connections to get into the industry.",

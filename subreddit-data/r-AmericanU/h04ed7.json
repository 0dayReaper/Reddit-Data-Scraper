AU needs to have a normal start in order to retain sophomores and juniors especially, and not have a massive drop-off in freshmen who put down a deposit, but then don\u2019t come.",

So they rented a ton of apartments at the Berkshire apartment complex across the street... I\u2019m going to assume they\u2019ll be doing something similar to reduce the number of people in the dorms.",

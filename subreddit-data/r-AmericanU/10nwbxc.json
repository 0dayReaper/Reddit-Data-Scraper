Given the large IR/Polisci major population, are the STEM programs any good?\n2. Dating scene? Wlw dating scene specifically? I mean its not a huge deal but like. It's a deal.\n3. Dorms. In general. \n4. Would the school environment be conducive to someone who, to put it bluntly, kinda has a stick up her ass (aka me)\n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "1) STEM is alright. They haven\u2019t given it nearly enough funding in the last two decades but are headed in the right direction. Kinda depends what specific part of STEM.\n\n2) It\u2019s a major US city with 4 major universities and 11 minor ones. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f If you want to find someone or just participate in the casual hookup culture, it\u2019s a good place to do it. AU definitely has a semi-LGBTQ lean in our student population, but there\u2019s like 10,000 of us (students). Plenty of fish in the AU sea.\n\n3) Solid-ish. East Campus has newer dorms that are (in general) a little nicer than main (campus). You\u2019ll catch on pretty fast as you get there for where you want to live sophomore, junior, or senior year (including off campus), but your freshman year is always going to have the less-ideal dorms regardless of which school you go to.\n\n4) Yes, everyone has a stick in their ass.",

            "comment": "1) I can\u2019t tell you much specifically about STEM bc I\u2019m not one but I feel like I\u2019ve met a decent number of bio majors. As a history major (also a much smaller program compared to CLEG/SIS/Poli-sci) there\u2019s definitely good and bad things in my experience. Often times the classes are smaller but could be harder to get into, etc. Overall you should be just fine but I would definitely plan to go to grad school elsewhere.\n\n2) As a fellow wlw you will have no issues if you make an effort and put yourself out there, esp with dating apps and such. It can be extremely hard to tell who is fruity and who\u2019s not but you\u2019ll get that in any major city so I wouldn\u2019t let that stop you. Being gay is very normalized and sometimes almost expected around here so don\u2019t worry about anything like that.\n\n3) Not that I have much to compare to but the dorms are nicer than I expected (I\u2019m in Anderson) as long as you DO NOT let yourself end up in Letts. That\u2019s not to say to expect hotel quality or anything but I would say they\u2019re probably slightly better/more spacious than a traditional dorm. Just get Anderson or Centennial and you\u2019ll be fine.\n\n4) I think this would depend on what you specifically mean by stick up your ass but I feel like that\u2019s a good way to describe a lot of the AU culture so I\u2019ll say yes lol.\n\nhope this helped!!",

                            "comment": "I can\u2019t say for certain how dorm selection works from the perspective of a regular student because I am in a living learning community for freshman year (University College) and my dorm building/floor was preselected so I only chose the room but I remember room selection being a big/competitive ordeal. I can\u2019t remember correctly if you get assigned a time for selection or if the housing portal just opens but either way you want to be on top of that because all the good rooms will be gone. They\u2019ll send you more info in plenty of time so just make sure to read over it thoroughly and act quickly because other people are going to do just that. I feel like you probably get some choice in the building but can\u2019t say for sure. I\u2019m at least 90% sure you get a say in floor and I know you get specific room say assuming you\u2019re not in a program that will put you in an assigned building/floor. Also STAY AWAY from terrace/lower level rooms if possible. They are basement level and most people I\u2019ve spoken to who live there chose it not knowing this and wish they hadn\u2019t.\n\nAnd yes, you\u2019ll fit in just fine here. There are definitely a range of people but most of them are incredibly serious about academics/careers/internships/etc. Many are not of course but it\u2019s definitely apart for the culture to grind and get ahead in your career. It feels like everybody is always looking for or currently working an internship.\n\nPls lmk if you have anymore questions about AU!! I love sharing my perspective on this stuff lol.",

            "comment": "1. STEM at AU is more just STM, our engineering department is virtually nonexistent. If you interested in staying within the hard sciences (bio/bio-chem/chem) AU is decent, but you\u2019ll want a masters from a more notable school.\n\n2. DC is a very promiscuous environment. It feels like most people in the area are more interested in hookups or FWB than long term dating, but maybe that\u2019s just because I haven\u2019t found anything that stuck. The hardest part is that sometimes you\u2019ll wish you had a car, but the metro here is a lot better than pretty much any city in the US besides NYC.\n\n3. Centennial and Anderson halls are generally considered the best freshmen dorms, but I had an awful roommate. Even if you end up in a \u201cworse\u201d hall, if your roommate is great you\u2019ll be happy. If you decide on AU I would hunt for a roommate before getting assigned one by the school.\n\n4. It\u2019s Washington DC, everyone\u2019s got a stick up their ass. It\u2019s just some are better at hiding it from everyone else than others.",

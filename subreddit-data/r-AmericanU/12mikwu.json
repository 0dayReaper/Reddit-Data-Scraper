    "postText": "I\u2019m currently trying to decide between au and lsu. For starters I really adore both schools. I have only able to tour lsu because it\u2019s in my state but I won\u2019t be able to tour au before may 1st due to financial reasons. I have zero complaints about lsu. Both schools are offering me similar aid amounts of 9k per year, not counting loans, as of rn (I\u2019m currently in aid appeals with lsu). However AU\u2019s giving me purely grants and work study while LSU is giving me a scholarship and grants. I\u2019m scared that AU would take my grants away because I heard they are weird with aid. My major would be business &amp; entertainment with a concentration of music performance and a minor in dance (au) or a major in theatre with a concentration in arts administration and a minor in music and/or dance (lsu).  \n\nSome useful info about me: \nI\u2019m a more extroverted person so I can make friends easily. I also want friends that I can relate to. I\u2019m a vegetarian. I\u2019m a queer leftist but I\u2019m also biracial and I\u2019m worried about diversity. I am also a low income person and would definitely be working in school. I also am heavily interested in internships and building connections in college. Both schools would provide me with that. AU would probably give me more connections while in school since I\u2019m interesting in AU\u2019s internships with record labels. I know that my LSU professors are nice and could get me connections across the country but I couldn\u2019t internship during the school semester. I also don\u2019t know what connections they could provide. \n\nI\u2019m also graduating with a diploma and an associates degree (because I go to an early college school). I\u2019m pretty confident that my college credits could transfer but I don\u2019t know how many would correspond with AU\u2019s core classes. I want my credits I took to mean something since I worked hard in hs to work for them. I know 30-40 would transfer at lsu.  \n\nI think AU would give me more opportunities and might be a more accepting environment. But I think it\u2019s a big risk going there cuz I heard everyone hates it and transfers, I\u2019m unsure about my credits, I don\u2019t want my aid taken away, and I don\u2019t want to feel like an outsider due to my financial situation. But I think LSU would be more racially diverse. The opportunities LSU could provide me are uncertain and may/may not take me where I need to go. I\u2019m less concerned about aid being taken away, and I know my credits will transfer.  \n\nTL;DR: Should I take a risk of aid falling through, may not take my credits, but great internship opportunities (that I have no clue I could have time for/ are paid or unpaid) at AU OR should I take a risk going to a school that may/may not set me up for success, will take my credits, doesn\u2019t have sketchy aid (as far as I know) but I may not find people like me at LSU.",

I really love AU and the academics/opportunities are definitely unmatched, but not worth a lifetime of debt. Honestly I\u2019ve found AU\u2019s aid to be pretty good, I\u2019ve never had a problem with the finaid office, but ik not everyone has that experience. As for other concerns more students transfer and drop out of LSU than AU (66% vs 80% grad rate) sooooo\u2026 haters are a loud minority of the student body. Happy to message and give real answers to any questions :)",

You can get opportunities being anywhere, you don't have to be in DC to do that. While AU does have an amazing queer community, it is **not** as diverse here as administration makes it seem. The student body is made up of classist, snobby elitists or people who are dirt poor receiving a full ride, there is really no in between. I am currently a senior about to graduate in May and I have so so so many regrets choosing AU. Feel free to message me if you want to talk more :)",

Some are complete hermits, but there will be people who like to go out and party often. Something you should know is that AU has absolutely 0 school spirit, the sports here suck, and there is really no such thing as an \"AU family\" and people do not feel as bound to AU as they would if they went to a state school. Since you are considering this over LSU, a huge state school with tons of school spirit, I thought this would be important to point out :)",

My current hs has a similar vibe. No school spirit, no sports here, and it\u2019s ridiculously small (my graduating class is like 50 people). I know AU is not that small. However I\u2019m very interested in school clubs and I know both schools have many to choose from.",

But our school spirit is definitely centered more in clubs. Our seasonal dance concert is happening now and you can\u2019t get tickets bc so many ppl are going to support them. AU has great clubs imo",

    "postText": "Hi! Next year, I\u2019ll be applying (likely ED), and, as the title may suggest, I\u2019m aiming for AU for Psychology undergrad. Here are my stats: \n\n- 3.6 weighted with three IB\u2019s (two SL, one HL) and one honors \n\n- by graduation, five language credits (two of which IB\u2019s) \n\n- SAT 1150 (kinda sucks because I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s a proper reflection) \n\n- Mock Trial and Foreign Affairs Club \n\n- one LR locked and loaded, can get others pretty easily. \n\n- NHS \n\n- varsity scholar \n\n- varsity sports (50-50 shot) \n\n- advanced diploma \n\n- high demonstrated interest in AU (currently signed up for four Future Eagle events this month), had first interaction with them in freshman year (campus tour) \n\n- two criminal justice college credits by graduation \n\n(I\u2019ll put anything else here if it comes to mind) \n\nThanks in advance! \n\nDemographics: white female, financially stable family, (the only \u201cminority\u201d group is fit into would be LGBT, but that\u2019s not of importance to admissions- right?) \n\n(I know u/burnout_latina just did a post like this, so I apologize for copying. I\u2019m posting this here because I posted to ChanceMe earlier today, and all I got was some kid calling me pretty dumb for my SAT score, which was neither very helpful nor insightful. Also, I wish her the best of luck; her stats seem very promising! Ideally, see you \u2018round campus (well, you\u2019re a stranger, so probably not, but you know what I mean)?)",

If it makes you feel better, mine was a 1070 and I didn\u2019t even submit it! I,too, hope to see you around campus! Your stats and ec\u2019s seem very promising as an ED II applicant (we are quite similar except I don\u2019t partake in any sport). \n\nI hope all goes well! Are you a junior?",

So really focus on your essays when they come out tell a coherent story through your whole package and you\u2019ll do great. AU doesn\u2019t require the sat which is more common now than before so just don\u2019t turn in your sat. You don\u2019t want to leave ? In people\u2019s head from reading your package so leave out anything that could be viewed as a negative. As many people say in any chance me post it\u2019s kind of a black box focus on making the best package possible and although I won\u2019t see you (I\u2019ll be king gone) I hope you have as good of an experience as I have (maybe you could even hope for better)",

You definitely will get in if you apply ED and will probably get some scholarship along with that.\n\nDO NOT let others who have their head in their ass tell you your stats are not \"good enough\" it better than good enough!\n\nIf you want to apply to other schools DO IT! You will miss 100% of the shots you do not take. I know this is said soo much but it is true. DON'T let haters hold you back. Prove them wrong, I know you can!",

AU's ED acceptance rate for 2019 was 81%, which is ridiculous (and probably how I got in lol). If you're 100% sure AU is where you want to go, and you can pay for it, then definitely do ED",

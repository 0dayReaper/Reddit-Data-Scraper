    "postText": "There's a documentary, Diary of a Political Tourist, that can **only** be found in American University's library. I think I might be in it, but I've never been able to watch it to find out.\n\nThe HBO documentary is by Alexandra Pelosi, the journalist behind Journeys With George. In 2003, we both attended the White House Congressional picnic. I stood in line to shake Bush's hand right after the Pelosi family. President Bush grabbed Alexandra Pelosi's camera, flipped it around, and said, \"When are you going to stop making money off me?\" It was pretty funny, and I would love to a screen-grab or even a few seconds of video just to confirm that, yes, this really happened. For anyone interested in politics, I am sure this documentary will be entertaining!\n\nThe DVD: [http://www.worldcat.org/title/diary-of-a-political-tourist/oclc/426177173](http://www.worldcat.org/title/diary-of-a-political-tourist/oclc/426177173&amp;referer=brief_results)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Here's me, First Lady Laura Bush, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski at the picnic.](https://preview.redd.it/az9r71r25w121.jpg?width=721&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1f0142ee032fbc794f77fa18d38f2b5e712ac68d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[My email to Alexandra Pelosi, and her reply where she says this footage is in Diary of a Political Tourist.](https://preview.redd.it/6fjzzdo85w121.png?width=1598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=31a0a9ff9ac993d4bff1c66f985a66e28d25f057)\n\nTL;DR: Looking for anyone with American University library card to check out a rare documentary and show me if I am in it.",

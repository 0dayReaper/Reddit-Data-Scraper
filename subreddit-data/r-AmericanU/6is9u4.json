It's just a really mixed group of people, but overall the building has a super chill vibe. As a transfer you'll be on a floor with all transfers so you don't have to worry about the freshman in the building bothering you. ",

It's generally considered one of the quieter dorms. One downside is that I think it's the only dorm that hasn't had the internal renovations like the other dorms have gotten in the past 7ish years. \n\nBut there's nothing *bad* about it. It's got a nice little amphitheater in front of it that can be a relaxing and quieter spot, and its a nice place for folks to get some fresh air that's not as busy as the quad. It's also been the location of the outdoors late night nasty for a few people over the years. ",

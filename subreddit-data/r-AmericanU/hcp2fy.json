    "postText": "So, I think my ideal college is AU. The thing is that I don\u2019t know much about how it *actually* is (I\u2019ve gone through the website and whatnot, but I don\u2019t know how well it represents the campus itself.)  \n\nI\u2019m looking to get my undergrad in psychology; what\u2019s their program like? \n\nAdditionally, though I haven\u2019t gotten my grades back, my guess is that my GPA (from the end of sophomore year) is 3.7-3.8 (somewhere in that range). I\u2019m also taking a few IB\u2019s short of the full diploma (taking four IB\u2019s next year- including IB HL lit and IB psych, which I think pertain to a possible psych major). \n\nSorry for the brain dump, y\u2019all. I hope this is the right sub for this question, and thanks in advance!  \n\nBonus: are there some sort of film production classes to take without *majoring* in it? \n\nEdit: I\u2019d it makes a difference, I\u2019m currently at a public northern VA high school.",

            "comment": "hey, i\u2019m currently a senior lit major at AU who was in a similar position to you in hs. i\u2019ll see if i can answer a few of your questions: \n\ni took HL lit, history, psych, and drama \u2014 i got highest marks on lit and history and ended up with nearly a minor in both subjects. my HL psych score was one point away from getting full credits; au\u2019s standards tend to be pretty high for IB scores. i shit the bed on my drama exam so no credit there. lol. \n\nfor one, the psych program/department is phenomenal from what i\u2019ve heard. i took two classes in the department &amp; had a great time, but they are definitely geared towards majors &amp; not people who are taking them as gen eds (although your program is different from mine). \n\nyou definitely seem on track to get into au, no question. do well on your psych exam and you might come in with a full semester of credit towards your major. \n\nre: film classes, yes there are some available for non-majors offered through the school of communications, however, they tend to have a lot of prerequisites &amp; some advisors will tell you that you need to be a minor to take them. i would really recommend taking classes in the lit department that are on the cinema studies track \u2014 you won\u2019t be getting production knowledge necessarily but you\u2019ll be learning a lot of film analysis fundamentals that you don\u2019t really get in a film production class. also, the faculty is some of the best in the nation &amp; pushing the boundaries of cinema studies. \n\ni hope that answered some of your questions. feel free to PM me and i\u2019d be happy to talk more.",

Ooh, that\u2019s interesting! \n\nIn regards to the classes you took, I\u2019m opting out of IB HOA (I\u2019m going for HN US/VA history), since the rigor is too much for me at this *current* moment. \n\nThat insight on the classes is really useful! I *would* like to do some editing stuff. I\u2019d like to be able to do stuff (as a hobby) similar to what [Jacksfilms](https://www.youtube.com/jacksfilms) does, especially because all of it is so creative. Currently, I\u2019m just working with iMovie mobile, but I\u2019m pretty proud of what I can do with it. Here\u2019s an [example](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=a6360RiGUYs&amp;lc=UgwJ6TAqQ6YW1mA07Ud4AaABAg) (it was actually a submission for one of his video contests- I tried to do it in a similar style to his, to the extent that my limiting software allowed), if you\u2019re curious, of a fairly quick edit- I was in a significant time crunch, and, thus, it came out more poorly than I know I could\u2019ve done). Anyway, enough on that tangent (sorry)! \n\nAlso, thank you for the confidence boost in regards to my chances! I know it\u2019s not guaranteed, of course, but I do think (if I improve my SAT score- my PSAT was below the average range, but I might opt for the ACT anyway) I have a shot if I work on certain areas more. \n\nThanks! And sorry, again, for the loonnngg response \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude05",

AU is test-optional, so focus on building a robust resume while you can! \n\nalso, i do want to encourage you to listen to what another commenter said. it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to branch out and look at other universities, especially ones what have better psych &amp; film programs than AU. it\u2019s important to keep in mind other things about the school: that it\u2019s mostly political science &amp; international relations-focused, that all universities will be facing major financial losses in the next few years, and that a culture of polisci/IR might not be the best fit for you. you still have a lot of time \u2014 do your research, have fun in high school, and apply to lots of schools if you can.",

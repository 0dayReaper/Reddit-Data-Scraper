It depends on if it was intentional or not.  Usually, you get a warning/may fail the class or assignment/and will likely have to write a paper about your wrong-doing.  Also you'll likely get censured which means if you screw up again you could either get expelled or lose housing.\n\nBy the way, I also know someone who intentionally did it and got suspended for a semester.  They did it twice, but I'm not sure if the first time was reported to Student Conduct.  I don't know of anyone who was expelled for this though.  I guess you'd have to be a serious repeat offender.",

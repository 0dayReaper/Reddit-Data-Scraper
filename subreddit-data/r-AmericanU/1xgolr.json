I took a tour of campus and loved it. I guess I really want to know why y'all chose American, what you think of the academics, professors, and people, which dorms are best\u2026 Really any information that could help me make my decision.

            "comment": "It'd be really helpful if you could provide some more information about why you're considering AU. AU is really, really different from JMU and Miami, so I think it's important for us to know what's drawing you to this school. Is it because of a major program you're looking for, just the feel of the campus, the social scene? You're going to get wildly varying answers with just a general question.\n\n**Academics**\n\nI'm in SIS, which is basically a general international relations major at the undergraduate level, and in Economics. I've been exposed to IR programs at a few other universities, all of which are generally considered superior to SIS in rankings. SIS has the most openminded and international outlook. By that I mean that studying IR at AU is going to mean being exposed to unexpected viewpoints and approaching questions from a more internationalist angle. Georgetown's SFS is great if you want to know how the US makes foreign policy, but SIS is better IMO for studying IR in general.\n\nThe Economics program, as with most of the traditionally quantitative social sciences, is really soft here. You can get a BA without taking calculus. Essentially AU takes an applied approach to economics. That's great if you want to know how economic theory applies to policy, not so useful if you want to use Econ as away to show off your quantitative skills.\n\nOverall, what I'm trying to say is that you need to think about this early. I know a lot of people who came to AU and switched majors early on (almost all of them out of SIS), so it's very much feasible. Kogod is a respectable business school and you can find really driven students there. However, if you're thinking even a little bit about moving into a more quantitative field or into the hard sciences, AU is probably not the best choice. There's plenty of flexibility in academic choice - as long as you stay in the liberal arts. \n\nIf you have more specific questions about SIS or Economics, I'd be happy to answer.\n\n**Social Life**\n\nThe dorms are all pretty great. It's really easy to make friends while living on campus and AU is more relaxed about visitors than any other universities I've visited. That said, it is a dry campus, which is a huge difference from JMU and Miami. You're not going to get a lot of big parties in the dorms, and you will get written up if you try. The consequences are pretty lax, but it creates a somewhat adversarial relationship between Housing &amp; Dining and the students. \n\nGreek life is tiny here compared to the other universities you're looking at. Frat parties are incredibly tame in comparison to state colleges. You aren't allowed to rush until your second semester. It's also a little peculiar in that students assemble for parties on campus, and then have brothers drive them to the fraternity houses, which are scattered in about a mile-and-a-half radius around the university. Don't come to AU for the Greek life. \n\n**Student Body**\n\nAU prides itself on its diversity. When I first arrived at AU, I didn't see it. Because it is an expensive private university in DC, there are a lot of really well off people here. The student body is mostly white and middle class. That said, there is a huge diversity in perspectives. It took me well into my first semester to begin to appreciate it, but there really are a lot of very different people here. Don't let first impressions fool you. Maybe that's just the college experience in general, but I've learned a tremendous amount from meeting and befriending people vastly different from myself. In a way, I think AU's medium size lends itself to that. My friends who went to my state's uni all still hang out together - at a place that big, it's easy to find a clique of like-minded people and stay inside it. On the other hand, my friends who went to small schools ended up hanging out with people very much like themselves because they picked schools that attracted those sorts of people. \n\nI don't know how different that will be from JMU, though by reputation I would think that AU will confront you with more heterogeneous viewpoints. Also, it is the most politically active university in the US, so expect to hear those viewpoints way more than you would like to.\n\n**DC**\n\nThe first two years on campus, I think most people stick to the red line. I didn't really start taking advantage of the city until after I turned 21, which I feel is pretty normal. AU is somewhat out of the way in DC, so don't expect to be going downtown every day, unless you have an internship. But it is there, and lots of people do take advantage of it.\n\n**Internships**\nWhich leads to my last point: DC has a huge market for interns. Almost everyone does one. Interning on the Hill is a rite of passage. I felt a lot of pressure to start looking early and often, much more so than I did to start looking for a job after college. I really liked that aspect, since almost everyone gets experience working before they graduate. Just don't expect to get paid. \n\nThere are a lot of useful threads on here for more specific topics. The one on dorms posted this week has way more information than I'd be able to give. But I hope this helped. It turned into something much longer than I'd intended. ",

I want to work in the music industry, and each school has something that I want. \n\nAmerican has the business and entertainment program, which is one of the reasons I'm looking into it. It's also in my favorite city in the entire world. I grew up in southern Maryland, so I'm pretty familiar with DC. I moved to Alabama when I was 12, and I live in South Carolina now, so I kind of want to get back home. \n\nJames Madison is closer to my family, and Harrisonburg is a really cute town. They also have a music industry minor that would be really great for me, because the courses they offer seem to be exactly what I need. The campus was absolutely wonderful, too.\n\nMiami was just gorgeous. I've never lived in Florida, and I fell in love with the state when I visited. Miami's campus is probably my favorite. They have a Media Management major and Music Industry minor, so that's what I'd be doing there.\n\nAcademically, they'd all be great schools, although a degree with American would probably hold the most weight. I'm not too interested in a major social life with parties and sororities and all that, but that's really not a deciding factor for me. I know that I can avoid it if I feel like I need to. Diversity isn't really that much of a factor for me, either. Miami and America are both really diverse, but James Madison is majority white and majority female, so I'd be part of the majority. \n\nCity-wise, I'd love to be back in DC. I know so much about it, and I think it would be easy to get right back into it. It's also got a pretty good market for what I want to do. That being said, Miami would also be a good fit. And I think that I'd be able to make the most out of Harrisonburg, because I've lived in different towns of different sizes, and I can adapt pretty easily. \n\nThanks for all your advice, it's really helpful! I appreciate it so much :)",

It really is a tremendously openminded university, both in terms of faculty and students, which I feel has rounded out my education in a way that wouldn't have happened at Georgetown or UMD, for example.\n\nI don't know anything about the business and entertainment program, unfortunately. One of my friends freshman year studies (I think?) audiotech, and he never complained. Kogod has a lot of good faculty but its reputation isn't that great. AU's been marketing Kogod as an up-and-coming business school for like thirty years, and it still hasn't really come yet. I don't know how Miami and JMU's programs stack up in comparison, but I'm not convinced that AU's degree would carry much more weight outside of DC.\n\nBased on the classes I've taken at Kogod, about a third of the students are super-driven in a classical business school sense, one third know that they want to go to college and get a job and little else, and the last third are there to party. That's just my opinion though, and I think SIS in general tends to look down on Kogod a little, so I'm biased. \n\nIt sounds like you're looking at all the right variables though. I'm sure that you'll enjoy whatever school you choose!",

Also, one of my friends at AU interned with the Grammy's, got tickets to the show, and was hired right out of graduating from AU. Obviously that's not a universal example, but I know kids at radio stations and record companies too. JMU is also a pretty huge party school, so if you're not that big on partying it may be easier to avoid at AU. If you come here you can party if you want, but if you don't you'll never feel like you have to. I'm majoring in Public Communications so if you have any questions about that, I'm all ears!",

                            "comment": "I think a lot of people go into SIS without fully understanding what it is. I don't think that it's SIS in particular that turns people off, just the major in general. I think it's the same elsewhere. International Relations is a very heavily academic field with little direct real-world applicability. Expect to do a lot of reading, a lot of thinking, and a lot of theory. It's a major where you're taught how to think and analyze questions, not a major where you're taught applied skills. The main complaints I've heard are excessive theory and that it feels pointless. \n\nI disagree with both of those points, but it depends in large part on how you organize your program. SIS is AU's largest school, and as such there's a lot of variety in classes within just that one program. First, with respect to theory, AU requires you to take the more heavily theoretical classes first. Intro to IR Research Methods in particular screens a lot of students out of the major. My first two semesters in SIS, I learned a lot about the history of the field, with a heavy focus on the major schools of thought, and how to research topics in the field. There was a lot of really, really dry reading that didn't touch on the issues that drew me to IR. \n\nAfter those first semesters, you have more power to choose your own classes and design your own research. That isn't necessarily the case at other IR programs. You begin to apply theory instead of just learning it, and that makes the whole thing more interesting - if you're into that sort of thing. Moreover, I know that other unis put an even heavier focus on IR theory than SIS does. \n\nAs for the point of an IR major, I think some people go into it with the idea that it will help them gain the skills necessary to succeed in the foreign service, or at a think tank, or something similar. Then they come into it and read theory, and think about questions, and don't feel like they're developing applicable skills. To an extent, that's true. However, as with other liberal arts majors, the \"skills\" you develop are your ability to think through questions, design research, and communicate your thoughts. \n\nTo sum up, I'd say half of my friends dropped SIS because they felt like they weren't learning anything useful. The other half realized they weren't interested in learning theory. Both groups generally went into majors like Communications or into Kogod, where you learn skills directly applicable to your career. In both cases, it was more a misunderstanding of what International Studies is than anything peculiar about SIS. \n\nSorry, I'm just full of text today. ",

The foreign service is *incredibly* competitive. A friend of mine went through the two rounds of foreign service exams successfully, then went through a personality profile. She passed everything, has great experiences in the past, speaks Spanish fluently, and wasn't offered a position because they don't have any positions that match her profile. Compounding that, the present fiscal climate has the foreign service at basically 0 employment growth. That means that any new hires have to wait for someone to leave first. It's an incredibly high-risk career path right now.\n\nI think SIS would do well to prepare someone for the foreign service.  To be honest, it's not a path that I ever seriously looked into so I'm not the best source for this. However, we do have several faculty teaching undergraduates who have extensive foreign service backgrounds. I've had classes with two former ambassadors and one current State Department official involved with Europe. I'm not sure what the Foreign Service is going to look for in new hires, but I think that sort of academic background would be helpful. \n\nIf you are set on foreign service, I think that Georgetown might be a better option. Like I said earlier, AU takes a more internationalist approach to international studies. SFS at Georgetown is more representative of the American foreign policy establishment. In general, I think that balances more in favor of AU, but for the foreign service in particular Georgetown might be better. Moreover, SFS was literally established to be the training ground for the foreign service, so the connections between the two are much greater than at AU.\n\nMore generally, if you do choose to study IR, I strongly recommend pursuing a double major in something more applied or quantitative. It's a really interesting field and I don't regret studying it for a moment, but there isn't an intuitive career path afterwards outside of academia and government. Looking for jobs, it's going to be really useful to be able to leverage SIS (look, I can think open-mindedly and internationally!) along with something applied or quantitative (but I also have skills that are useful!).",

Unlike most areas of SIS, there's sort of a career path there if you're interested in working for NGOs. I think a lot of people become disillusioned with that line of work even when only studying it, but I know a lot of people who are drawn to it for that sort of missionary zeal to do good in other countries.\n\nAlso, I think that SIS is a decent way to prepare for law school, since the skills you develop in critical thinking, clear argument, etc. are the sort of things that law schools look for.",

It is a first year program where you choose a seminar-style class, live on the same floor as your classmates and a program associate (kind of like a TA), and go out into the city every Wednesday for \"labs\" to do something related to your class. I did the US Society program and I loved it. We went to the 9/11 Memorial at the Pentagon, L Ron Hubbard's house, and the monuments, among other places. I thought our labs were some of the best because they really added to what we were learning in class, but all of the programs are great. Some of the best professors in the schools teach these classes because they know that students who do the program are curious about the topic and truly want to learn. All of the class offering are general education classes so you don't have to worry about them fitting into your major.\n\nIt isn't perfect for everyone, but I am so glad I did it. I quickly got used to the Metro and it made it very easy to travel by myself. You also get to know your professor and classmates very well, so it's nice to have that safety net for your first semester.\n\nIf you have any other questions about American or University College, let me know!",

I didn't think so, but I guess having the PA take us to our labs (who was also an undergraduate student though, just older than us) made them feel like they were being controlled. I didn't think that at all. It was nice to be helped with the Metro during the first semester. Another complaint was that some University College classes didn't go into the city every week. I only heard this from a few people, and even if they didn't go off campus, they still had an activity. There were a few days that my class stayed on campus, but outside speakers were brought in (one day a police officer talked to us about gangs and gogo music in DC, another person talked about hunger and poverty in DC). I can't think of any other complaints, but if I remember something I'll let you know.\n\nBasically, the complaints were more whiney than actual issues with the program. I'm very glad I did it.\n\nSomething I forgot to mention: most programs are half a year, but a few are full year. Also, be prepared to do work for the class. It's still a class; you will have papers and projects. Work varies between classes, so if you know anyone who has done the program, you should ask them about their specific class if you have questions.\n\nI hope that made sense. Let me know if you have any other questions!",

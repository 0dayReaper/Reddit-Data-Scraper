    "postText": "Hi everyone!\nI am going to join AU this fall for PhD in economics. But seeing the qs ranking of the university fall from 2017 to 2021, I got a bit nervous. I heard it's a great place for IR and PS. But then, is it worth doing PhD in economics at AU? Also, what are the pros and cons of pursuing phD at AU? \nAny review and advice would be helpful.\n\nMany thanks!",

I will say that all the Econ professors I have had are excellent, arguably better than my professors from UNC 10 years ago. Quality of education does not equal ranking. The question is if you want a legitimately great education or prestige.",

I was wondering about the quality of education there as I got motivated to apply there because some of the recent work of two professors influence my phd research area a lot. But seeing the ranking falling over time, I got worried if I chose the right one. Thanks once again.",

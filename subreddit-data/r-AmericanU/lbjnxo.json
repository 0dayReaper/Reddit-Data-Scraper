    "postText": "Hey y'all! I was accepted last night into AU's School of International Service for a Master of Ethics, Peace &amp; Human Rights. I'm still buzzing and can't wrap my head around the opportunity to get an education at such a prestigious foreign affairs school, but here we are!\n\nIf anyone is in SIS or around the area of the campus, let me know what I should expect! I haven't been to DC since I was still visiting my grandparents growing up every summer, but that was at least 10 years ago.\n\nThanks, y'all!",

I've spent most of my masters virtual so my recommendations will reflect that.\n\nI've loved pretty much all my classes. I've had great experiences with most of my professors. The one I didn't, doesn't work at AU anymore. Professors are there for more than just teaching, utilize all their resources, connections, etc. I currently work for a professor I had last year. Go to office hours as much as possible. If you really like the work of a specific professor, get to know them better and pick their brain on how they got to where they are. \n\nPlaces to study: the Dav coffee shop in the SIS building, the Graduate research center in the basement of SIS is awesome, and the EPHR lounge on the second floor of SIS. I haven't spent much time on campus beyond the SIS building. \n\nThings I wish I knew: this doesn't apply to me, because I live close to campus, but: try to live close by. Taking the metro home after a class ends at 10:50pm sucks. Try to get at least a part time gig your first semester. It will help with money and time management. Attend any and all events you can, there's usually free food and you'll meet awesome people and learn a lot.",

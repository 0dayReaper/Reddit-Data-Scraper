I know a lot of students are moving out right now and leaving stuff behind.\n\nCan anyone offer good info on where to go to look for stuff this weekend? I know dorms are probably past, but what are neighborhoods with a lot of students where there might be stuff put out. Or let your friends know to get in touch.\n\nLet\u2019s keep stuff out of the landfill and get them to people who need it. Send me a message or just post here.\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t think you missed much by missing dorm move out honestly, maybe some lamps and an odd chair or two. Plenty of students live in the apartments right near campus (Avalon at Foxhall, the Berkshires, 4200 Cathedral) along with the buildings in along Wisconsin Ave from Friendship Heights down through Glover Park, particularly around Tenleytown/McClean Gardens/Cathedral Heights. Also check out Connecticut Ave, especially Van Ness/Cleveland Park area, but extending up to Chevy Chase and down to Woodley Park. I would imagine some also live more towards Spring Valley/AU Park but tbh I don\u2019t recall any of my friends living that way down Mass Ave, I think it\u2019s mostly houses anyway. Additionally, join the Facebook group \u201cAU Free and For Sale\u201d along with your local \u201cBuy Nothing\u201d group (assuming you live in DC itself), plenty of furniture will pop up there.",

    "postText": "I'm a documentary filmmaker trying to establish a brand. I'm searching for a young band that is well established and is serious about their music to feature in a short film. Ideally you would be embarking on one of your first tours or recording your first/second album. \n\nThis story is meant to highlight the artists/musicians involved and establish a personal narrative for the band/artists. Once completed this footage would be available for your group to use as publicity and promote your name. \n\nPlease reach out via text so we can chat more if you are interested. Trying to get the ball rolling on this within the next two weeks. ",

Like most WCL students he have no idea what goes on up the street, but we're now thoroughly intrigued and want to know what prompted this mass email. So, does anyone have the low down?",

Nothing too shocking; it's all stuff you'd hear about EI doing. You can read it all at fratergateau.tumblr.com I think. ",

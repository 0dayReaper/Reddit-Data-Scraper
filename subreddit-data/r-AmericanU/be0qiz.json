    "postText": "Hi! I was wondering if anyone here has taken that program in the past and what it was like? I'm also wondering if anyone else is on here looking for reviews as well because I can't seem to find any. Im 17 and im wondering if because its open for all highschool students if being an upcoming senior will make me feel like im the oldest one there and if there is much freedom or if its all really structured? Please comment or respond I really want some honest feedback American is my top choice and I'm really looking forward to four weeks there I just want to know what its like first. Thanks!",

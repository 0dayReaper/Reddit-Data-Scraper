The school roommate assignment process can be either really lucky or really unlucky. Off campus however, you each get your own room and privacy. I\u2019m personally in favor of living in MD or VA because the housing costs generally run a little cheaper, but if you want to be close to school you\u2019re gonna have to pay more for it.\nAlso the school does have suite style rooms for upperclassmen, but the square footage is a little lacking. Have a look around and remember you have options other than the dorms.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nSo AU is on my list of schools I'm interested in transferring to, I'm hoping be in SOC &amp; securing spring acceptance 2021 since I'm graduating in December. Other than that, I know a few people there so I'm not totally new to the scene. I have a few questions regarding AU life and pretty much the school in general:\n\n- Would you say the SOC is worth the price? It's a pricey school to say the least, especially with the endowment seriously lacking, but I've heard their communications programs are pretty good for the price, and I'm hoping to transfer a bunch of credits from cc to AU so I can stay on track for graduation.\n\n- How are internships and professors? I know they're not specifically career counselors, but do you get the impression they would be willing to put in a good word for you, or is it not like that at all?\n\n- How is it for transfers? I feel like GW and GTown are both pretty adverse to cc transfers or transfers in general, and that why I'm kind of wary of them, but AU seems to be open to people of different walks of life. Just trying to get a feel of how rough the transition would be.\n\n- Is finding off campus housing difficult without roommates? I would be willing just to rent a room or something small not even an apartment, but I'm not sure how easy that is given its DC.\n\n- How's the feel of the campus? I've read GW is pretty much just rich kids and GTown is what you would expect. Is there school pride? Are people generally welcoming/neutral or do they just stick to their own circles?\n\nAny other general advice about the school or your personal experiences would greatly be appreciated. Thank you!!",

            "comment": "Hi! Congrats on wrapping up cc soon :)\n\n- I\u2019m not an SOC student so I can\u2019t speak specifically to the value of that program, but, for what it\u2019s worth, AU is generally a tiny bit cheaper than and a tiny bit more generous with aid than the other DC schools. If you\u2019re committed to a DC private school in general, then AU\u2019s value proposition is decent.\n\n- Professors here can be all over the place - I\u2019ve had both awful ones and phenomenal ones. Key is just doing your research and clinging to the profs you find that you love. Profs that you befriend will generally be willing to put in good words for you. Internship opportunities in DC really are beyond plentiful - there WILL be somewhere you can go, if you look hard enough. AU does a good job of spamming everyone multiple times a day over email with internship openings. However, know that with many federal internships, the USAJOBS hiring process makes it almost impossible for others to recommend or refer you.\n\n- Can\u2019t speak to the transfer experience, but I definitely think AU has a chiller and more welcoming vibe than the other DC private schools.\n\n- DC has a painfully high cost of living - all food and housing here is likely much more expensive than you\u2019re used to. Living alone off campus isn\u2019t gonna be cheap unless you\u2019re willing to live far out in the suburbs and commute (which is what I do, with roommates). However, there are a lot of Facebook groups (I\u2019m in at least like 11?) dedicated solely to finding DC roommates, so opportunities exist.\n\n- People are generally pretty nice and friendly - haven\u2019t had the GW/GT experience I keep hearing about. However, we have no football team and are 55% off campus students so school spirit is really weak lol. Don\u2019t expect everyone to get together at huge gatherings like at a giant state school in the middle of nowhere. People spend their days interning and nights getting drunk with friends at home.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m pretty happy with choosing AU. The people are nice, I like my profs, and the opportunities are great. I moved out here from Los Angeles and while I miss home I think I made the right choice. PM me if I can answer more questions!",

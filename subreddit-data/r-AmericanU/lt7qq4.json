    "postText": "Hi, was thinking about attending the MPA program at AU. I wanted some more info from actual students in that program to see how they like it. Are their opportunities for professional development/networking? Also in general, how is the school for students with disabilities? Is it very wheelchair accessible? The current college I'm at has a pretty strong MPA program, and it's cheaper. But I just moved to DC and don't know if I want to do an online degree in NY if I stay here.",

I founds two campus tours on YouTube that helped me decide if navigating the campus was possible for me. One tour is specifically the school of public affairs campus and one is the campus as a whole. Both are kind of rough to watch but definitely helpful",

Dont expect au/spa to just hand you a job or networking connections because you pay tuition.",

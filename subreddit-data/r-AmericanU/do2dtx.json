    "postText": "I've been heavily considering American University as a top choice for school but I would be lying if I said that tuition wasn't a worry. I want to study political science/government so something in the D.C. area is quite important to me. I was wondering how worthwhile political science/ government majors have found their study at American University.",

Outside of SIS and SPA, I felt that the education and experience was the same quality as just about any highly rated state school, just 2x more expensive. Not a bad school by any means, but if you\u2019re worried about the value consider how hard you want to work for it",

AU financial aid is among the worst of private schools. You will have to take mandatory courses like AUx which are probably at the level of your middle school or freshman year high school classes at best. Other core courses like Habits of Mind are also a colossal waste of time.",

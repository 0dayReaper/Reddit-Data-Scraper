I was ED so I\u2019ll have an early-ish room pick time. (Roommate TBD!).\n\nQuestion: Best room locations? Closer to common area? Closer to bathroom? Elevator? One side of the hall vs other (odd/even #??).\n\nI\u2019m most interested in social and convenience perks. (I sleep like a rock so not focused on \u201cquieter\u201dlocation). Will those recommended room locations be obvious when choosing? (I can\u2019t find any Anderson floor plans yet for the floor layout just room floor plans). \n\nThanks! I know this is kind of obsessive but it is good distraction from my unnecessarily heavy final month of HS workload!",

    "postText": "Question-  I am a parent of a possible upcoming Freshman, and on our visit to campus, I didn't see any restaurants, bars, pizza places, etc... for students to go.  Is there a little street of bars and restaurants that I missed?  Or do students mainly stay on campus?  Do you take the metro to a certain area to get away from campus?  Just wondering about things to do near campus.  I also didn't see any apartments or areas where students would live off campus.  Are there any, or do students have to travel if they live off campus?  Or do you live on campus all 4 years?  Thanks!",

            "comment": "Most freshmen tend to stay in the neighborhood most of the time when it comes to recreation. Walking over to the cathedral heights neighborhood is common (many students live there) and there are some nice restaurants. Taking the shuttle bus up to tenlytown for the restaurants there is also common. If you\u2019re after a movie theater and some more shopping options friendship heights is just one stop on the metro from tenly.\n\nIf they\u2019re after more than that, 20 mins to half an hour on the red line in the other direction will put you in downtown dc.",

When I was a freshman back in 2017 the freshman dorm front desks handed out free tickets to some of the latest movies. Those were for the Georgetown AMC though, so you had to take a bus or car unless you wanted to do an hour + walk each way",

            "comment": "U Street or H Street for bars. Both are safe after dark (as much as a city street is, right?) because they\u2019re always very popular places. It\u2019s not \u201cclose\u201d to campus, and will require a 30 minute metro ride (depending on where you want to go of course). Adam\u2019s Morgan is another DC staple that is usually popular with locals, and is a fairly safe neighborhood that I know is a go-to hangout spot for AU/GW/GT students. \n\nDo students mainly stay on campus? Kind of a tough question to answer during COVID of course, but I would offer that with some 10,000+ enrolled students there\u2019s a mixed crowd that stays on campus during the night and the crowd that goes off and parties. I\u2019ve never had an issue finding people to hang out with regardless of what I want to do. The perk of going to a big school.\n\nYes, we metro everywhere. Since we have the U-Pass, it means we get \u201cfree\u201d (it\u2019s a flat rate included in our tuition \u2014 I think its around $600) rides around the city, so we just scan it at the station and ride aimlessly around (only somewhat kidding). But yes, the metro (and buses!) are a go-to. In recent years they\u2019ve been changing/altering the time the metro\u2019s close though, so I\u2019ve spent many a pretty penny uber\u2019ing home from a bar at 2AM. Just something to consider.\n\nThere are PLENTY of apartments around campus. The \u201cAU staples\u201d are The Berkshires, The Avalon, Cathedral Commons, and more down by Glover Park. Prices vary. I currently share a 2 bedroom with two other roommates, and we pay around $3000/month. It\u2019s a fairly big apartment just for the three of us, and we leased it a little late for a \u201cdeal\u201d. In short: yes there\u2019s definitely plenty of places to rent from \u2014 also I\u2019m sure plenty of friends will want to rent apartments second/third year. My travel time is like 5 minutes walking (uphill). Travel times will vary. Glover Park is a bus ride, but cheaper(?) rents (I\u2019ve heard).\n\nBtw Best pizza (by the slice) is imo \u201cWise Guy Pizza way down Mass Ave, a little south of NOMA. Best sub shop in the city is down by Farragut, and it\u2019s called Bub and Pop\u2019s. $10 a sandwich and you\u2019ll be full for the day.",

You can also go into Md and Va using the metro. I also live in Gloverpark but you COULD hypothetically live outside of DC and still be okay with a UPass or a Car.

They're about a 15 minute walk away from campus.\n\nThere are two options for on-campus apartment-style housing which is Nebraska Hall and The Frequency (though The Frequency is not technically on-campus and I would not recommend living there) but from what I've heard it's very hard to get on-campus housing past sophomore year.",

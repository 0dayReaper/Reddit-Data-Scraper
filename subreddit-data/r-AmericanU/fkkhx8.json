Try to get recommendations from alumni and just keep showing interest that will be the best way. Let me know if you need anymore help.",

I\u2019m glad I was though I plan to stay in state with a university I had matched with-they gave me a full ride merit scholarship!! People say stuff happens for a reason which I don\u2019t necessarily believe but for me at least being waitlisted was a huge eye opener. Now I will be in less debt :) \nAlso I checked the stats for those waitlisted last year and later admitted- there was a pretty good amount of students who were admitted:) best of luck to you!!! \nSorry if this was obnoxious",

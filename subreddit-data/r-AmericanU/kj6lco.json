            "comment": "I have. It was kind of funny. It was my first college tour, and I was fairly apathetic toward it. My mom had also said that this is more just for getting a feel of a college tours are like, and I was not very happy to be on the tour in some freezing temperatures. Needless to say, we dipped about a half hour early, because it got pretty boring. It\u2019s helpful, but it does tend to stretch out a little long. After about an hour, you got a little bit boring. Of course, this was pre-Covid, so I\u2019m sure many things have changed from my experience (for example, maybe one of the best parts of the tour was at the very beginning we we sat in the theater and watched a video about the college and the campus. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re still having the indoor portion. They also had us wait indoors I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s still going to happen with Covid). \n\n\nBottom line: yes. I think it really helped. That being said, I am fairly local to the area, so it wasn\u2019t very hard to get to. If it\u2019s more of a hike for you, I don\u2019t know, since maybe you could get a similar feel from reading things online/doing virtual tours. But if you are close enough, I do suggest it. One thing that really stuck out to me about their campus what is the safety. For example, at all times, you should be able to see at least two red lights. They\u2019re basically on these telephone pole like objects, and their emergency buttons. It\u2019s pretty nice to see that they have those kinds of security measures. It seems like a very safe area, especially for DC, but it\u2019s still reassuring.",

            "comment": "I just graduated from AU in May but when I applied ED in Fall 2015 the ED acceptance rate was ~80% and the RD acceptance rate ended up being 25.7%. So if you think AU is the school for you (and especially if you're concerned about not having the stats for RD), then I'd suggest taking the path of (almost) guaranteed admission by applying ED. \n\nI loved my experience at AU! I majored in international studies and learned two languages but took advantage of many opportunities outside of SIS -- opportunities like interning at The World Bank, winning the American University Concerto and Aria Competition, making my piano concerto soloist debut with the American University Symphony Orchestra, studying abroad at an elite conservatory in Vienna, Austria, being published a dozen times in the university alumni magazine, or taking over the AU Instagram page four-times. \n\nThat's not even to mention the academic opportunities. Classes of mine regularly had presidential candidates, fortune 500 CEOs, foreign ministers, and the president of USAID to speak \u2014 and not as a 'thing,' just casually. \n\nThere are probably 120+ clubs, and all the ones I joined led me to niches of friends and opportunities that I wouldn't have had otherwise. Student life is very open-ended, meaning if you're into cheering on the sports teams or partying, that definitely exists. If you're into interning or joining a club, that definitely exists. If you're into venturing out into the city and everything it has to offer, the national mall is 30 minutes away from the quad when the shuttles and metro are running well. \n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any questions about AU or otherwise (@teddyc212 on Instagram).

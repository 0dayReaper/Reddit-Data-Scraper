I was thinking about looking more into the JLC PhD program and was wondering if anyone could share their thoughts on it\n\n\u2022 What do/did you think of the program in general?\n\n\u2022 How was the application process? \n\nThank you in advance and congrats to all of the people who are posting about getting into their AU PhD/Masters/Undergrad programs! \ud83c\udf89",

AU does a good job bringing in people with lots of experience outside of academia which helps when you\u2019re producing research because they will guide you towards questions that will push the practical world forward not just academia. I love AU and wouldn\u2019t change my decision to spend so much time here for anything. It\u2019s also a great place to make connections if you want to be connected politically.",

            "comment": "Hello! Cool to hear that you're considering the JLC program! So I actually applied for the PhD this cycle and am awaiting results (insert anxious face here) - but with that said I am happy to speak to the application process and what I'm aware of for the program. \n\nThe program:\n\n* As with all PhD programs, it makes sense to know (at least generally) why you want the degree (what you'd like to do, what you're specifically excited about, how a PhD will get you to your career goals). In my case, I applied because I'm super excited about research on extremism at an individual level and there are a few great faculty directly and indirectly associated with the department who are experts in the area. This may not be your area of interest, and there are certainly some great professors in other topics of JLC/Criminology , but the point stands that it makes sense to be sure there is some overlap or folks you could see yourself working under.  \n* For \\*reasons\\* I wanted to really understand the comprehensive exam process prior to applying; from what I've seen/heard/etc., the JLC program's comp process is actually pretty constructive. Regardless of your focus, you build a literature list with a committee that is finite (very important) and related to what you are focusing on studying. For the second comp, it is similar but directly applied to what your dissertation will cover. This works great with my learning style and what I'm hoping to get out of the program - expertise in a specific area that I'm passionate about. Other PhD programs do it differently (more broad, other discrete topics, different kinds of tests, etc). Again, regardless - I would deeply consider if the comps process makes sense for you and your goals when applying to programs.  \n\nThe application process:\n\n* Fairly straightforward as far as social science PhD programs go? Personal statement, transcripts, a resume/CV and a writing sample were the main items in addition to letters of recommendation and a GRE score.  \n* Deadline was 11 January and all applicants got an email from the chair early Feb saying when to expect a decision by (March 1 - again, insert anxious face here). This was a nice touch since I hadn't gotten as direct of communication from some other programs previously. \n* The assistant dean of graduate enrollment for SPA was super helpful in working through specifics of my application (I'm hoping to come in with some credits)\n\nAnyhow - I'm rambling here a bit - happy to answer any follow up questions or discuss specifics!\n\n\\- Stats4doggos",

(I took the test a while ago and have an average score. Nothing awful but nothing that would stand out haha)",

A lot of folks who research in the area have an \"origin story\" for their passion on the subject - mine isn't quite so grand but I think there's a lot to be gained from trying to systematically understand something that most folks think is just \"so out there\" and has an outsized impact on our life relative to the incidence/risk. I got hooked on the research side of it when I did my M.A. and found (like many) that the data behind our understanding of the phenomenon is still growing quite a bit and there are loads of other questions we haven't even built the framework to know how to ask. \n\nAs to the GRE, I can't say for sure how heavily the score is weighted but if you have a talk with the assistant dean of grad enrollment for SPA they are able to share the median scores of the admitted class of recent years. Assume some year-to-year variation, but if you're near/above the median it is probably a mark in your favor. The other area where I understand it comes into play is for summer funding (however I'm not certain how heavily it is weighted there either?).",

I actually got a notification of my decision letter shortly after posting yesterday though! I'll be attending in the fall :) \n\nVery best of luck to you in the meantime - I fully appreciate that the waiting sucks. Fingers crossed for you friend.",

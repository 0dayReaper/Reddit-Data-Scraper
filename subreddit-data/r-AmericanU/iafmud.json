He goes into great detail but demonstrates rather than explains so you can understand. The only issue is he has difficulty describing what he wants for writing assignments. This is quasi-intentional so that 1.) you learn on your own and 2.) come to office hours for one on one help. Overall, great class, it\u2019s just the onus is on you to chase for clarity. For me, it was no big deal.",

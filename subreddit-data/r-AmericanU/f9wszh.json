    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI'll most likely spend one semester as an international exchange student at American University for this upcoming fall!\n\nGiven the fact that the AU website is extremelly inconvenient and annoying in regards to finding information, I'd like to ask you guys if there is a set date/approximation of when the fall 2020 courses start? Is there a university-wide date or does it differ heavily depending on what kind of courses you take\\`?\n\nThanks in advance :)",

            "comment": "University-wide, classes start in late August, usually somewhere in the 20s, and go until early December, with finals the next week (usually the 10s). There are a handful of courses that start later in the semester and/or end earlier, but I think those are usually either electives or particularly specialized classes, and most don't follow that structure. It will tell you when you register for a class when it starts and ends, and most are simply the beginning of the semester to the end of the semester.",

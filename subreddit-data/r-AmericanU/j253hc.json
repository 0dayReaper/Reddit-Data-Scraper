The application for the spring is due October 1 so if you\u2019re serious you need to get it sent right away. I honestly don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have enough time to get transcripts ready since the deadline is so soon. I would highly suggest just going for a fall transfer because it\u2019s a little too late at this point.",

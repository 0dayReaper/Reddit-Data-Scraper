    "postText": "1. It looks like the absolute lowest one pays in a roommate situation is $450 (in houses of 5-6 roommates), depending on location, and the average might be in the $650-$850 range. Is this accurate? I know that many places are $1000+ with roommates, but am trying to suss out cheaper solutions first.\n\n2. I am already scouring Craigslist, Padmapper, Zillow, etc. - all of the well-known sites for finding housing. In Chicago (where I am), I would have a few additional suggestions/resources to pass on to someone new in town who was looking for a place, and am wondering if DC-dwellers also have \"tips\" they could share. Any particular local magazine or newspaper, any community bulletin board or listserv I should join? Anything other than the usual 3-5 websites that everyone uses?\n\n3. As for location - I will have both a bike and a car, and am not averse to walking. What neighborhoods do most American grad students and their friends live in? What neighborhoods are unsafe and to be avoided at all costs? I see a lot of ads for areas called Petworth and Columbia Heights but they don't look the most convenient by public transportation (for days when it must be taken). How many students opt to live in Arlington, Bethesda or Silver Spring? Is it worth it to try to live closer to campus? Is free parking a possibility anywhere remotely near campus? Is it safe to lock your bike up outside (in Chicago it can be dicey because the bike thieves are so good). \n\nWhat would you suggest to a friend moving to the city? Any/all help appreciated!",

            "comment": "1. The DC housing market is very erratic so it is possible to find the ~$800 price range but you'll likely not be living within city limits. Even with roommates I think it's hard to find at that range if you're looking for actual space. Especially with your car. It's probably going to be closer to $900-1000\n\n2. All the ones you've listed are the ones I have relied on to find my housing. As I said earlier, it changes a lot so check it daily and you might get lucky. I would email AU and ask to get on the 2-3 listservs they have cause there are students constantly advertising rooms available.  \n\n3. I would really think over if you need to bring your car. Finding a place that has parking lot will increase your rent a lot. If you plan on street parking then you have some options in terms of what kind of pass you can get, but all are expensive. I think the student out of state parking pass is like $200-300. The DC DMV site can help you with that. \n\nBut if you do decide to bring your car it gives you the freedom of driving to campus so you can live farther away. As a grad student you're classes will likely have a start time of 530 pm or later and the parking garage on campus stops charging at 5. You'll find a lot of people commute different distances and will have their own opinions on the matter, it all depends on how much you mind being stuck in traffic. If can, bring your bike inside with you at your place. ",

            "comment": "I highly recommend searching for a house to rent in Twinbrook. This past year my girlfriend and I have split a four bedroom house with another couple we met by posting on /r/DCforRent. We split the rent evenly, bringing a two story 4/2 to $550 a person. We have a cat and two dogs with a huge fenced in backyard with a shed and everything.\n\nNow, I can't figure out why, but no one lives here from American. It's a hidden gem in my opinion. People see where Twinbrook is on the map (just at the edge of North Bethesda and Rockville) and write it off immediately. However, as a grad student, I spend the vast majority of my time on campus or at home studying. I go out with other grad students right off campus after class some nights, and weekends I go into downtown D.C. I don't need to live in the thick of the city.\n\nThe metro ride to campus is 15 minutes from the twinbrook metro,  shorter than what most people living around Arlington endure, and it's surrounded by neighborhoods that are very walkable and bikeable. My bike commute is less than five minutes. The shopping around here is great, so with a car you'll be able to take care of all the needs you could in any well developed suburban area. Things are also significantly cheaper than in D.C. When you do metro into D.C., it's usually less than 30 minutes to get to Metro Center Station. On weekends the metro runs till at least 2 a.m., usually slightly later, so I never have problems getting home. \n\nI also find that people who can't afford to live right near a metro in D.C. so live in a less desirable location end up spending more time on their commute by needing to use the slower bus system or biking/walking long distances. Driving in D.C. is too awful to be worth it in my opinion.\n\nGood luck! Feel free to ask any questions.",

            "comment": "Heyo! Keep in mind that AU now has a policy that students get a free unlimited metro pass. There's a shuttle that goes to and from Tenlytown station on the red line, so if you find a place anywhere close to a stop on the red line your commute will not be so bad. Many students stay in the apartment buildings close to AU (the Berkshire, and the Avalon are two.) \n\nAnother suggestion would be to look for a room to rent in someone's house over by the law school, as there is also a shuttle that goes to and from the main school and the metro from there. \n\nFor searching for places, I've always used PadMapper, as it pulls in data from Craigslist, Zillow and a few other sites. Makes searching that much easier!\n\nHappy hunting!",

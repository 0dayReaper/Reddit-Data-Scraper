I\u2019m not particularly great at math, but other than that I\u2019m somewhat confident in my abilities. How easy is it to get an A at AU? I\u2019ve heard some horror stories of grade curving (lowering) at other schools to decrease student pop, but I know that\u2019s a rarity. Thanks!",

This is very true for IP lawyers.  If you have a STEM major and do well in enough in law school you can make big $.  Same goes for finance.",

But for perspective, all of the DC schools that you mentioned are collectively much better off during the fall and spring (when it's only us in town) compared to the summer when college kids come to DC from all over the country to compete for the same internships, so in some ways it comes down to how you look at it. I think something like 96% of SPA kids have at least one internship before they graduate so it's extremely common",

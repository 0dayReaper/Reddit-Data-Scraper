Is it that fun?  \nAs a guy, do you have to be in a frat, if so, how hard is it to join?  \nHow well do fakes work?  \nHow often and where are parties?  \nAre there many non-frat parties?  \n\n\nAny input is appreciated, thanks so much!",

            "comment": "idc enough to speak about the party scene bc it really depends on who you know and stuff and that's just...too much effort to go into. you'll find stuff out once you're here. and frats aren't a huge thing at AU, so you don't *have* to be in one.\n\nanyway, about fakes? the stores by AU aren't reliable. as a whole, DC isn't the best place to use a fake bc they're really diligent and stuff. i had a friend who had her fake taken like 2 weeks into the semester. so don't expect it to work in the city. you'll probably have to venture into NoVA or MD, idk. and you can always find someone to buy for you if you need it \ud83d\ude02",

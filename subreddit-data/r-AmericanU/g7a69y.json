    "postText": "I was recently accepted into AU for International Studies and to McGill. I regret not applying to AU's honors college, but there is nothing I can do about it now. To be honest, although they are both great schools, neither school was my first choice. I am worried that McGill will be too large for me (the lecture sizes seem insane) and will be a big transition because I come from a small, community-focused U.S. high school (only about 70 people in my senior class). That being said, I know McGill's academics are top-notch which is really important to me. I really want to have a challenging and rigorous academic experience. I also really like the idea of being in a French-speaking city because I have been working hard to improve my French language skills. With AU, I am worried that I will not feel very challenged academically and I have been told that community at American can also be lacking. I really do not want to be bored or feel like I am wasting money and not learning a lot. I do like the idea of being in D.C. because it would be a good fit for me for internships in PoliSci and International Relations. There is a possibility that I may transfer the following year, but I really want to avoid entering college with that mindset and want to pick the school that is the best fit for me. I'd love your thought and advice!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(I was also accepted to GW and Trinity College. I wanted more of a nuclear campus so I ruled out GW and Trinity felt too isolated. If you think these would fit me better, I'd love to be convinced)",

            "comment": "If u have to pick one, assuming money isn\u2019t a problem(I personally think McGill is cheaper since you pay ik Canadian dollars), pick McGill. Not only is McGill more reputable internationally (it\u2019s renowned whole world, I bet not a lot of people has heard of AU in Canada). I\u2019ve visited McGill before since my cousin is from Montreal and used to attend Concordia. It\u2019s located on top of the hill and it\u2019s pretty isolated from rest of the city. \n\nPlus I think you\u2019re overrating the culture shock you would experience as an American in Montreal. Montreal is probably the most English-friendly speaking city in the whole province of Quebec. There is Montreal and there is rest of Quebec. I have been there multiple times and not once was not speaking French a problem. I\u2019d definitely recommend you learn some basic French just to be polite (\u201cexcusez-moi Monsieur/madame est-ce que tu parles anglais\u201d is the most important frase lol). I would say 90% of the people speak English and sometimes English is the de facto language of the community or work area. Especially in McGill. McGill is an anglophone university and French is almost non-existent. You\u2019d probably run into more Chinese or Spanish speakers than French. \n\nThat is to say, both DC and Montreal would give you a culture shock if you transition from a small town, but hey, that\u2019s part of life. You\u2019ll eventually do that in the future if you want to work in a metropolitan area, why not start now. I\u2019m saying, not knowing French would not be an issue in Montreal. However, the winter lasts for almost 7 months and it\u2019s much colder than DC. So yeah. \n\nI\u2019d recommend McGill.",

When you visited did you get any sense of McGill's community or student life?\n\nThanks again for all the advice!",

                            "comment": "Good to know, then you should definitely pick McGill then. Honestly for learning French I\u2019d suggest you do study abroad in a francophone country in Europe instead. Canadian French is not real French, even a French Canadian will tell you that. They use words from the 19th century that modern French does not use anymore. For example, a car is a \u201cvoiture\u201d in Paris French, but is a \u201cchar\u201d in Canadian French, because back then there was no cars so \u201cchar\u201d became the word to describe cars because it means \u201cchariots\u201d. I can go on and on. \n\nI don\u2019t speak French but I know people from France and a lot of them make fun of the Canadian French,. People would \u201cfait un accent quebecois\u201d to make fun of it at dinner table in France. So yeah, it\u2019s not the right accent to learn. Think of it as a southern Us accent or Scottish accent. \n\nI feel like it\u2019s a city campus and doesn\u2019t really have the stuff that traditional Us campus has, like a quad for example. But McGill basically occupies the entire area so yeah it\u2019s like a bubble itself. I think you\u2019ll have ur circle of friends if you branch out. You just have to do it early otherwise it\u2019s hard to break into a circle. Same can be said about AU or any other college campus. I feel like getting a job really helps. When I was at AU I worked at DMTI as a math tutor and made a circle of friends pretty quickly and got to know the professors better. So yeah, I\u2019d recommend getting a school job.",

I was in the honors college and had a full ride, and it was still fucking tough. If you're as smart as you think you are, then you should have some/a lot of AP credits and you'll be able to get into some more advanced classes right away.  You should just be focused on getting a really good GPA.\n\nFor the community - my first year I lived on campus, and it was great. I then moved off campus my second year, to be with my friends, and I lost touch with everyone outside of my immediate friend group. And I don't talk to anyone I went to College with today. I'm socially lazy so this was just my experience, but take what you want from that.",

SIS (school of international studies) is a big community and you'll have your pick of niche groups to choose from. \n\nI was an American Studies/Secondary Edu double major - I had to look elsewhere for my peeps, which was just fine by me. \n\nD.C. offers you the supplemental education that other schools can't - AU has plenty of opportunity in itself, but its location is a buffet of options so far as internships, CSLP credits, independent learning opportunities, not to mention the Study Abroad/Alternative-Break programs.\n\nWhat I couldn't find at AU, I found in the city itself. Once you get out of the Tenleytown neighborhood where AU is located (which is rich &amp; white AF; everyone commutes from MD or VA or is a transplant D.C. resident), and get into neighborhoods like Mt Pleasant and Columbia Heights (or if you're adventurous, Anacostia or anything SE of the Patomnic River...)  the neighborhoods that have active social justice causes running through them, you can find cool people doing amazing things with very  small budgets - take notes.\n\nAlso, it's worth mentioning that French is in the top 5 non-English languages spoken in D.C. (in no particular order: Spanish, French, Vietnamese, Amharic,  Korean, Mandarin) - Check out MLOV (many languages one voice) if you want an awesome group of people to get involved with on language access rights.",

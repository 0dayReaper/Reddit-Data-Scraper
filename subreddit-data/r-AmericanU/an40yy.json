I don\u2019t say this to denigrate Sylvia Burwell. In fact, from what I\u2019ve heard, she\u2019s a lot better than our former President.

This is one of the biggest complaints that AU students have, yet they continue to outsource their food services to the hellish company known as Aramark. They also require freshman to get a meal plan with 175 meal swipes a semester. Due to the food sucking so badly, nobody actually uses all of them, and they do not rollover. The meal swipes themselves are a ripoff because a meal swipe worth $13-15 can buy you a bagel or a sub which would normally be worth $5-7. You\u2019re better off just paying with actual money, but HAHA no, AU requires you to buy the meal plan. I\u2019m guessing they do this so students don\u2019t starve, but it is counterintuitive because I literally lost over 10 pounds my first semester.\n\nThe freshman dorms absolutely suck, and I cannot emphasize this enough.

Go online and find a used or cheaper version on Chegg or Amazon. \n\nAmerican U has some great students and great professors. I\u2019m not trying to dissuade you from attending AU. I just want you to know what you\u2019re getting into. In fact, if you can be the person to stand up to administration and fix the issues associated with this school, then by all means. Power to you. I wish you guys best of luck! ",

            "comment": "This might be a length response only because I appreciate your effort of writing up a post to inform prospective students on their potential college experience at AU. Let's see if I can format decently...\n\n&gt; First and foremost, the professors are great. You will get some of the  best and brightest people with a lot of experience in their respective  fields teaching your classes. \n\nIn my experience, I wholeheartedly agree. I have to mention though, that I know people who have vehemently disliked professors, even beyond petty reasons (e.g. grades). Although those issues might be valid to their preferences, I usually find that most complaints come from a close-minded mentality, where one seeks like-minded approval, and anything else is unacceptable. \n\n&gt; That being said, administration absolutely sucks. I don\u2019t say this to  denigrate Sylvia Burwell. In fact, from what I\u2019ve heard, she\u2019s a lot  better than our former President. Overall, administration just doesn\u2019t  listen to the students. This is one of the biggest complaints that AU students have,  yet they continue to outsource their food services to the hellish  company known as Aramark.  \n\nThis is a legit complaint imo. Although I haven't had too much interaction, I generally lean towards this as well. My only support in this is the continued support of Aramark and the way administration handles on campus-dining options. \n\n&gt; The food sucks so badly, and the options are lacking. They also require freshman to get a meal plan with 175 meal swipes a  semester. Due to the food sucking so badly, nobody actually uses all of  them, and they do not rollover. The meal swipes themselves are a ripoff  because a meal swipe worth $13-15 can buy you a bagel or a sub which  would normally be worth $5-7. You\u2019re better off just paying with actual  money, but HAHA no, AU requires you to buy the meal plan. I\u2019m guessing  they do this so students don\u2019t starve, but it is counterintuitive  because I literally lost over 10 pounds my first semester. \n\nThis is the most overrated complaint at AU. \n\nI don't know how everyone else's school lunches were throughout elementary/middle/high, but we had actual bad food. Like the kind of bad quality that a company buys/sells in bulk because it is the cheapest option that the shitty county budget had for school meals. AU dining hall food is a godsend compared to that. That's coming from someone who grew up with all the spices and flavors of latin and indian cuisine because of my family and my city. I hate sounding pretentious, but I know what good food tastes like. \n\nThe food at AU is literally FINE. I've been to friends' colleges and it's generally the same. Most of the time it isn't great and it isn't terrible. The rotation of food will usually result in something average, with there being times that something you love is on the menu, or something you hate. That's preference. There are plenty of options, so if you know basic nutrition, the buffet style lets you eat all the nutrients your body needs. I don't know where this remarkable palette for tasting food comes from when everyone is fine with eating fast food anyway. Blows my mind. \n\nLegitimate complaints in my eyes are when students complain that their vegan/vegetarian/kosher/hypoallergenic diets aren't able to be satisfied by the dining hall. Thankfully, they've been better about this in the past year from what I've seen. Another legit complaint is the terrible service when even a small rush of students come through and the supply of the main dish doesn't meet demand. Quantity can be a problem with some foods which is ridiculous. The at times inaccurate/missing nutrition labels is the last complaint I have for the dining hall.\n\nI'm sure there can be more, but \"the food sucks\" is not a fair criticism when the food doesn't match your preferences. They seem to be having a strong push for student involvement in the meal plans, so everyone should definitely participate in that. We'll see how that goes.  \n\n\nAs for costs, I personally find all the plans too expensive so I buy and cook my own food. Though, your bagel complaint is solved by paying in Dining dollars/eagle bucks instead of using the swipe. In general, if the goal is to be money-efficient, TDR is the only place meal swipes should be used because it has the highest cost. You should use dining/eagle bucks everywhere else until you run out of those. Furthermore, when y'all have mad swipes at the end of the semester because you can afford to eat out or hit up Uber Eats every week, money does not sound like the issue.\n\nAs for weight, that's extremely subjective to every person. Plenty of people gain the freshman 15, some people hit the gym, some people learn how to eat well, etc. \n\n&gt; The freshman dorms absolutely suck, and I cannot emphasize this enough.  (Anderson is still much better than the alternatives, however). Mice,  rats, and bats run (or fly) rampant throughout the dorm halls. The water  in Letts is never hot. \n\nThe water complaint is one I have shared as well. Water pressure sucks in comparison to other colleges I've slept over at. Hot water can be annoying. I've grown up with that, so I deal with it, but fuck that we deserve better quality for the price of housing - needs to be voiced more by student body.\n\nRodent troubles is not exclusive to AU. Literally every massive complex that houses thousands of different of lifestyles will run into this issue. \n\nFreshman dorms - community can be fun, I enjoyed that from Anderson. Communal bathrooms fucking suck. My experience was before the renovations. \n\n&gt; AUx is a joke, and it is a two semester class that they can compile into  a 3 class lecture. If you value freedom of speech, belief, or  expression, you will not enjoy this class, butttt you\u2019re required to  take it. I literally spent over an hour of my life one day learning  about my \u201cprivilege\u201d. \n\nNo experience with this personally. A note about the \"privilege\" comment, I typically find most people on campus are pretty fucking privileged. Like shit, I knew I was blessed compared to some of my friends and immigrant family members growing up, but goddamn if college students aren't some of the most privileged fuckers out there. You saying something like this is a big red flag. \n\n&gt; The student health center, however, is amazing. The staff are very nice  and the doctors are very good with students. They offer a comprehensive  evaluation and a variety of services and treatments. You almost never  have to leave campus for medical reasons - except to pick up  prescriptions. \n\nI got charged $25 thinking school insurance would cover me going to check if someone would tell me whether or not I should seek further care after dropping a 35lb weight on my toes and not being able to use them for a few days. Got told I was fine. Haven't been there since. Friends have said that they dislike the mental health care services offered. I haven't tried that yet personally. \n\n&gt; Finally, if you do choose American - DO NOT BUY YOUR TEXTBOOKS. (Or rent  them for that matter) Almost every book you need is available in the  library, and you can literally check out a book and scan what you need  for each particular class. And if you do choose to get your own book, DO  NOT buy from the bookstore as they are so completely overpriced. Go  online and find a used or cheaper version on Chegg or Amazon. \n\nBig agree. Shit is literally free. (Except for STEM classes that have the online assignment bullshit you gotta deal with). Additionally, just google the title and author. Often enough, some PDF for some edition of your book will be found. Otherwise, if you've made it through my post and are here, feel free to message me and I can show you another pretty reliable way to find it for free. \n\n  \nTL;DR \n\nEducation is good. Administration can be bad. Food is fine. Voice your complaints. College is college is college is college.   \n",

                    "comment": "&gt;The food at AU is literally FINE. I've been to friends' colleges and it's generally the same. Most of the time it isn't great and it isn't terrible. The rotation of food will usually result in something average, with there being times that something you love is on the menu, or something you hate. That's preference. There are plenty of options, so if you know basic nutrition, the buffet style lets you eat all the nutrients your body needs. I don't know where this remarkable palette for tasting food comes from when everyone is fine with eating fast food anyway. Blows my mind.\n\nThe issue is that aramark never rotates the food, then charges $14 a swipe and sometimes there isn't any food! I've eaten at plenty of other college dining halls. The taste isn't much better anywhere else, but its cheaper and has more variety. Also they don't have a bunch of mold issues. \n\n&gt;Legitimate complaints in my eyes are when students complain that their vegan/vegetarian/kosher/hypoallergenic diets aren't able to be satisfied by the dining hall. Thankfully, they've been better about this in the past year from what I've seen.\n\nPeople are complaining that there isn't any food for people that can't have gluten. That's a legitimate complaint. Same with penut allergies \n\n&gt;They seem to be having a strong push for student involvement in the meal plans, so everyone should definitely participate in that. We'll see how that goes.\n\nThat is complete fucking bullshit and anyone here knows it. They have fucking focus groups that I go to and waste hours of my time at just for them to 100% ignore the focus group and do what they were going to do anyways. Look at the recent town hall with dining, it just because dining refusing to accept the fact that they aren't 100% perfect. \n\n\nthat's honestly a huge problem with AU. Every school has it's issues, but other schools don't have the nerve to lie to your face or ignore you whenever you speak up. My room hit 95 degrees last year, housing told me to suck it up. There was a used condom on the hughes elevator last semester, 2fix told me to clean it up myself. I didn't have an advisor for 5 months while I was trying to get stuff done, SPA advising office ignored my emails. There were dirty bowls being places out for use in TDR. I sent an email (with pictures) and was ignored. I go to their stupid dining focus groups, they ignore us and do what they were going to do anyways. (If you don't want to listen to a focus group, don't waste our time!) My roommate was selling drugs out of the room, the CD and RA did nothing productive and actually managed to make the issue worse. The hughes elevator keeps breaking (I have videos of it showing the out of service indicator), I raise my concerns. Told that the elevator hasn't broken down at all. They decide to take one of the two hughes elevators down for replacement, it takes 16 weeks to replace. No elevator should take 16 weeks, maybe 4 if you don't invest much work into it. I asked why they couldn't do it over the summer, was told essentially \"we've decided to do it now, and if we wait until summer then we won't do it now which is what we've decided to do so no.\" There was a hole in the oven in my lounge in anderson last year, they did nothing about it. There were mice running though the kitchen/lounge, I sent them a video and they refused to put down mouse traps. I went out and bought my own to put down (no poison, just a regular trap). The traps were promptly thrown away by the self-rightous AU ambassadors who \"didn't want to give visiting students the wrong impression.\" I brought my car here this year to go to my doctor's office (need a car to get there). I paid the $500 fucking dollars a semester, and they still threatened to boot me because they couldn't read the fucking license plate. \n\nI'm paying 60 thousand fucking dollars a year for this school, I deserve some sort of response when issues this big arrise. But all I get are read-recipts or \"we will get back to you in a bit\" and then they never do. I'm so fucking sick of people saying that we should just stand up for ourselves a bit more because when we do AU just ignores us. Fuck this school and fuck everyone that works for it. ",

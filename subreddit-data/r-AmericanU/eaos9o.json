    "postText": "Hey everyone - \n\nI\u2019m a prospective \u201824 looking to apply to the 3 year Politics, Policy, and Law program. I know the priority deadline for the application is this Sunday, 12/15 and I plan to submit the PPL supplement in time. I have my Common App done as well and have already submitted my test scores, but my school had an issue sending my transcript just to AU. Everything should be sorted out now, but I know my transcript will not send by Sunday. Will this be a problem, and if so will contacting them admissions office help? Thanks",

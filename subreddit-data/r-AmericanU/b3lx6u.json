For me, the main benefit has been being able to interact with other people who are interested in politics and law since none of my friends back home are interested in that stuff. The classes through the program so far have been good and the professors are great, especially if you go to office hours. \n\nIf you want to talk more, feel free to shoot me a message.",

                            "comment": "Where do I begin?\n\n* Parking. They raised the parking permit price for the sole purpose of encouraging people to be green and not drive. This does not help people that can't take public transportation where they need to go. Also they ticketed my car multiple times because they couldn't read the plate. And 2 days before Spring break they sent out an email saying that no one could park their car on campus during spring break.\n\n* Housing. Was told on my tour that any upperclassman that wanted housing got it. That was a bold-faced lie. Also my room in Anderson routinely got to 90+ degrees last year, housing told me to open a window, which did not help. Don't forget the number of mice and rats in Anderson. It looks nice on the tour, they just renovated it. Because AU likes attracting freshman; but they don't give a shit about you once you are here. I'm sitting here, applying for upperclassman housing now. First issue, they moved the date to sign-up back by 3 weeks(!!!) claiming that they wanted to give us more time to make an informed decision, which is complete and utter bullshit because we still don't know anything. Also, when the undisclosed (I've called and asked) number of upperclassmen log on at their scheduled time (you are screwed if you have class), you pick a room. If they've all filled up, you are shit out of luck. That's the sign-up process. (They originally told us that we would be chosen by a lottery if we got to live on campus, then went back on that word)\n\n* Summer housing- they don't open it up until mid-april. So if you are taking summer classes you have to find somewhere off-campus, because it's too late to find an apartment if they don't give you on-campus housing\n\n* Food. TDR (&amp; aramark) is terrible. There are only a few independently operated places on campus. One was illegally evicted and is suing. Meal plans are overpriced, they keep trying to raise the price even further. TDR frequently has no cups, food, utensils, etc. You know, stuff a dining hall needs to have!! Also hygiene is not a huge deal for them; I've reported issues and been ignored.\n\n* Students in academics. Students try to act like they all work hard. They don't. The amount of partying at this school is insane. Curves are ridiculously easy. They dick off in class, spending all of it on their phone.\n\n* Advising. I went 5 months without an advisor due to the department deciding to restructure. Not a flaky employee, this was just bad administration. And this was during a time when I needed forms signed by my advisor. To top it all off, they didn't even bother telling me ahead of time (or even when it happened) that I was losing my advisor. I emailed her a question and got an automated response that as of 2 weeks prior she had left the department. \n\n\nThere's a lot more; I could go on for hours. Also some issues that my lawyer has advised shouldn't be discussed openly. (Hint: AU fucked up big) But the worst part is that the administration doesn't care if you have issues. I email, call, show up to their focus groups, fill out the surveys, etc. But nothing ever changes. They say they will follow up, then never do even with prompting. The focus groups go completely ignored (which is honestly the worst part. Don't hold a focus group if you aren't going to listen to it), etc etc. \n\n\nHonestly, this school has fucked me over more times than I can count. A lot of students have issues with this school; some have more than others. There are certainly students who like it (AU Ambassadors are these students), but I think our retention rate speaks for itself. Save yourself the stress, go somewhere with a competent administration.

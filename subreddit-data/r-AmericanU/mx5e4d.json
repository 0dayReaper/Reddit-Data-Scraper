It got old fast, and that was when I could get jamba juice, chick-fil-a, and tavern meals with swipes. I heard that went away. You can always find a hungry upper classman in your dorm that will take some of your extra swipes though.",

AU of course didn't like that, but no way were we gonna let hundreds of swipes go to waste. \n\nIf you find yourself with a ton of swipes, try to make sure food goes to hungry people. Leftover swipes is leftover money",

I did hit up The Tavern quite a bit, if that's still around. And that place in the tunnel across from the building you buy books in makes a decent tuna melt.",

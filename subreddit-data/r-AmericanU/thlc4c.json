    "postText": "Hey! I got into American University and am really excited. With my letter I got no letters discussing merit scholarship and need based aid. I had applied for it and did all of my CSS/FAFSA paperwork before Jan 15.\n\nI have sent the financial aid office an email and plan to call them on Monday. I\u2019m just curious if this happened to anyone else and if it\u2019s reason for concern.",

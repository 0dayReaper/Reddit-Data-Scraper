    "postText": "hello ! just had a super quick question regarding the math placement exam. \n\nIt advises us incoming students to avoid using smartphones and tablets when taking this test. I know this warning isn\u2019t for nothing, but can the smartphone format of the test really be that bad ? \n\nMy computer isn\u2019t the fastest, and im worried it may prevent me from taking the test in a timely manner. But, if I reeeeally shouldn\u2019t attempt it on my phone, I\u2019ll just find another one lol. \n\nthanks",

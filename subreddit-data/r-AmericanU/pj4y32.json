    "postText": "I have been thinking of creating a synthesizer club (instrument, not philosophical synthesis); if anyone is interested in being a part of an experience in auditory exploration through electronics and music feel free to reach out. AU's policy states that we need to have at least 8 members to be an official club.\n\nIf anyone is interested in this proposition dont hesitate to dm, upvote, or comment. \n\nJust another sonic explorer,\n\nJames ('24)",

    "postText": "Hey everyone! I\u2019m a senior in high school who was admitted to AU today. I was offered entry into the Sakura Scholars program, which I\u2019m pretty psyched about. I did my research and became really interested in it (how I came to apply), but do you guys know anything else about it that can\u2019t be found online? My main question is about tuition and fees \u2014 do we pay AU tuition when we study at Ritsumeikan or Ritsumeikan\u2019s tuition. Thanks for the help in advance!",

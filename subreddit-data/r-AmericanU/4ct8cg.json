(double majoring possible. Main major is psych.) \n\nIt's really hard to choose. Looking for some inside opinions!\n\nThanks!",

For evolutionary psych, the prof said he was teaching this like a graduate level course (despite being a 200 level class) and if you failed, you were part of large group of people who he failed. You needed to study your ass off for that class, and you learned good stuff, but goddamn those tests were hard. 300+ level profs got a lot nicer, and wanted to work with you in small groups/1on1.",

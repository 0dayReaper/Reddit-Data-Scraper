    "postText": "I\u2019m a junior in HS right now and I\u2019m planning to apply for AU Early Decision with a 1300 SAT and a 3.33 unweighted and 4.1 weighted gpa in the fall. I\u2019m applying for International Studies at SIS. \n\nHow is the Dictators and Diplomacy course in terms of quality and just general info from those who took it?\n\nAlso, along with a pretty solid record of extracurricular activities and social science + history classes and 4 years of athletics and captainship, do I stand a good chance of getting in as is? \n\nThanks, and I hope to be seeing you guys in Fall of 2019 :) !",

I know nothing about CoS. I'm commenting mainly because while I haven't taken Dictators and Diplomacy and have no idea who teaches it, I want to recommend Professor Banks as someone you might be interested in taking. I've taken two classes with him and I'm signed up for two more in the fall. If you're interested in dictators and/or diplomacy you'll enjoy him. ",

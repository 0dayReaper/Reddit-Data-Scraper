    "postText": "I'm a prospective student and I plan to major in International Studies with a focus on Europe. I'm really torn between this school and UF right now, so I'd like to know what people majoring in International Studies think about the program in general. I want to study the Russian language and focus a lot on Eastern Europe, so I'd appreciate insight on how good American is at the Russian language program or teaching things about Eastern Europe in general. Also, does American teach any classes that focus a lot on Poland and do they plan to teach Polish as a language in the future? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I've heard about American is that the hustle culture is pretty intense and people take many internships. For those majoring in International Studies, how much pressure do you feel to take on a full courseload, do an internship, and join clubs? I'm an ambitious, hardworking person but at the same time, I don't want to drain myself with taking on more responsibilities than I can handle.",

            "comment": "I haven\u2019t taken it myself, but from what I know the Russian program is very difficult. (My bf is an IR major who took Russian for the language rec.) I wasn\u2019t able to find any current or past courses related to Poland, nor do I think there\u2019s a plan right now to begin teaching Polish, but AU does offer a study abroad program with Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w. \n\nI agree AU is intense with the hustle culture, but the onus is on the individual regarding how much they buy into it. If you come in with AP or duel enrollment credit, you can afford to take fewer than 15 credits for some semesters (I\u2019m taking 12 this semester, 3 of which are from 1-credit classes, and still on track to graduate in the fall - a semester before intended). It definitely helps take some of the academic pressure off. I\u2019m not in IR, but in my experience you can certainly balance both clubs and internships here \u2014 a friend of mine is a Hilltern and VP of a club eboard I\u2019m also on \u2014 but don\u2019t overload with clubs, dedicate yourself to 1-2 that really resonate with you. \n\nI work part-time and I\u2019m involved with 4 different extracurriculars (2 are pretty low workload though). I have a good sleep schedule and see my friends at least once a week. Any more than this, though, and I would probably explode.",

Now it's even more difficult for me to make a decision lol, but I'm glad to know that I won't feel overly pressured to take on huge responsibilities.",

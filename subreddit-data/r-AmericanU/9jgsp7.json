I was just wondering if it\u2019s any good? and if they have a drumline as part of it or if it\u2019s just horns/winds? It won\u2019t really affect whether or not I want to go in the fall but I just don\u2019t want to get my hopes up lol",

We are kinda small but have definitely grown since last year, we usually have 15ish people at every game\n\nIn terms of drumming we have a drum set that is used at games. If we have more than one drummer at a particular game they\u2019ll rotate whose playing; we also have crash symbols and a extra base drum that drummers use as well. ",

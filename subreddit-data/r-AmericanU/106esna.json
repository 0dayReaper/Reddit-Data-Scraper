    "postText": "I am applying for the Master of Arts in Intercultural and International Communication at AU for this upcoming fall term. American University has the best public diplomacy program in the country and it aligns with my career goals. However, my concern is the cost of housing in the DMV area, how to navigate school life in my mid-30s after working since graduating, and re-adapting to living in the United States after being abroad for close to a decade. What recommendations or advice do you have for someone in my position?",

Prioritize what\u2019s important to you when it comes to where you live. My gf and I needed in-unit washing and drying, a minimum 800sqft, and windows. That was enough of an issue to find. If you find something that fits your needs, just go for it! There might be something better, but there always will be. I\u2019d keep in mind that DC itself is not walkable. It has walkable areas, but if you have no car, you *need* to think about public transport and how much time that\u2019ll add to your commute. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what kind of job you\u2019ll be working but plenty of other people work as well. You just have to accept that you\u2019re going to have no life. You can try to make a few nights that you prioritize, but as a whole, you\u2019re gonna be busy. I can get away with my weekend evenings being free but I only work 20-25 hours a week.\n\nMy biggest piece of real advice though is to find the things that bring you joy and hold on to them. If you have a TV show you like watching, don\u2019t let your classwork make you think you can\u2019t take an hour to watch it. If you want to go for runs every day, go for it. You have to have joy when you\u2019re in grad school. You will burnout so fast otherwise.",

    "postText": "I am a potential undergrad student deciding between Baylor and AU. I was hoping someone could tell me a little bit about their honest experience at AU, including social life and academics. \n\nFor reference, I am very interested in political science. I am not really into heavy partying, but would like the opportunity to go to parties / big social events occasionally without having to commit myself to that lifestyle. I would consider myself left on the political spectrum, but I am a nondenominational practicing Christian.\n\nHow do y\u2019all think I\u2019d fit in at AU? Thanks for all y\u2019all\u2019s help.",

Well depends.  if you consider opportunity like \u201cinternship on the Hill\u201d or \u201clobbying for certain politicians\u201d, or even having to witness \u201cimpeachment\u201d, \u201cinaugural speech\u201d in person as invaluables. If you do, I suppose it is. \n\nDon\u2019t really know much about Baylor other than basketball tbh. I doubt it can compete with AU\u2019s poly Sci.",

You would definitely fit in with all the poli sci majors! a vast majority of the students there are left-leaning and also AU is a Christian school (but welcoming to people of any religion).",

Religion doesn\u2019t affect the way it runs or is operated at all, and frankly you could spend your entire time at AU and never know that there\u2019s any association with a church (I don\u2019t know, and I think pretty much no one does, what the connection even does).\n\nAU *does* have a pretty noticeable contingency of people from Jewish families\u2014I think somewhere between 10 and 25%, but I really don\u2019t know what it is. I say \u201ccome from Jewish families\u201d because, while there is a vibrant Jewish community for those involved in Hillel and Chabad, I think most Jewish students aren\u2019t particularly religious; they\u2019re the people who slow up for high holidays and Passover and enjoy Hanukkah and that\u2019s about it. I\u2019m generalizing though, don\u2019t know how accurate that really is (just my perception).\n\nCan\u2019t speak for other religions/religious communities. But it definitely *is* diverse and accepting, as you said.",

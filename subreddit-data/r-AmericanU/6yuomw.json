Do you think it will be difficult for me to find friends? \n\nAre there any kind of proper gaming or anime clubx on campus? Are they active? \n\nA general review of the school from current or former students would be awesome, I'm interested in whether students like the school. ",

            "comment": "1) Man, you are going to have your eyes opened no matter where you go. You can, in fact, have friends that are both female or gay (only a slight level of snark intended). Seriously though, AU and Washington D.C. have people from all walks of life. I grew up in upper-class, white family from Cleveland. My best friend from AU grew up poor Puerto Rican family in New Jersey. If you go there you'll meet people from literally everywhere. Don't worry about labels. All that said, my understanding while AU had a male-female imbalance while I was there it has gotten much closer to 50-50. Making friends in college is odd but it will happen. Just remember, you don't have to be friends with your roommate, the people down the hall, etc (you should be *friendly* but I think too many people put pressure on being friends with the first people they meet in the dorm, which is silly in retrospect).\n\n2) I can't speak to specific clubs as I've been gone for a while. I'd be SHOCKED though if you can't at least find a group of people who are into gaming/anime. There were a ton of people that were into that when I was there. \n\n3) I think I loved Washington DC more than I liked AU but I still had a blast. Met some great people, really enjoyed my studies, 10/10 would do it again. Nothing better than the first warm sunny day at AU and all the students go out layout on the quad, playing music, throwing a Frisbee/football. When you're 21 go to Chef Geoffs for happy hour and get a Super Mug. I still dream about washing those burgers down with a nice mug of beer. I'm into sports so I think my biggest complaint would be their teams were usually awful. ",

Anime club met to watch anime every week, and organized a trip to Katsucon each year. These clubs were active in 2009, 2010, 2011. Not sure where they're at now it's been awhile since I've been on campus. ",

Do you think it will be difficult for me to find friends?\n\nThis really shouldn't be a unique roadblock in making friends\u2014just keep an open mind and be friendly to people. Even if it is, there are still sufficient straight men here for it to not be a problem.  \nI don't know the data, but I'm not sure if \"most students are either female or gay\" is even accurate. That just feels wrong, though don't take my word for it.\n\n&gt;Are there any kind of proper gaming or anime clubx on campus? Are they active?\n\nThere's a weekly gaming club, which ranges from board games to table top RPGs to video games. I've heard talks of there being an anime club, but that's not my field of interest, so I don't know any news.\n\n&gt;A general review of the school from current or former students would be awesome, I'm interested in whether students like the school.\n\nI'm a sophomore and I enjoy it so far. I appreciate the experience that my professors have brought to the table, and the classes have been good for the most part (there have been a few professors that were letdowns, but I think that's inevitable). There are lots of clubs, ranging from theatre to debate to martial arts, so that whatever your interests, you will surely find an outlet you like with people into some of the same things you are. Lots of great academic programs, as well as networking opportunities. And being in DC is great\u2014there's a lot of everything going on in the city, be it business or art or politics (weird, I know)\u2014so regardless of your interests hobby-wise or career-wise, you will probably find something to make your time here worthwhile.

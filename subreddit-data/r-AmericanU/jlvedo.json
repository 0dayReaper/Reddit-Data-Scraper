    "postText": "Salutations,\n\nI plan to transfer to a four year university in the fall 2021 and American University is on my list of options. As I\u2019m sure some of you may have heard, there is a global pandemic going on and I know some schools are not dealing with it very well. I really don\u2019t think COVID will get any better by the fall l, so this will affect my decision. In order to make sure I\u2019ve got all the information I need I want to get the opinions of those who are currently attending the university. \n\nSo, in your opinion how do you think American University is handling the situation? \n\nThank you.",

They just announced their very vague plan of select arts and science classes in person and a very limited residential experience for some freshman in the spring. They are handling it by being online right now and trying to be in person but who knows if that\u2019ll actually happen. \n\nIts hard to give you a good answer when we arent in person but thats what i got",

Our college is also online but is doing a lot in terms of providing students with help whether it\u2019s financially or academically. For example, they  show and provide students different ways of applying to grants and other COVID financial aids. The CARES ACT funding is really easy to apply to (I heard it\u2019s difficult in some places). \n\nDo you think the administration is doing what they can (even if online) to help the students?",

We have a pass/fail option and a retake option for classes too. The health center also offers daily weekday COVID testing! I think AU is doing a pretty good job!",

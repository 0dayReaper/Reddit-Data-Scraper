I met my roommate and my best friends in my UC Cohort. It is an amazing program and the professors really do cultivate a sense of community in class and that translates to your home life. I definitely loved it and if you have any questions about it reply here or feel free to dm and text me! There are not rly any negatives other than the fact that if you meet and get a roommate outside of UC it\u2019ll be hard but it can also increase your chances of getting a roommate who is passionate about the same things as you. You\u2019re also have a likely chance of being in Anderson or letts best halls for freshman.",

Housing will use roommate profile questions, community designations, and room type preferences to match students who do not request a specific roommate.\u201d\n\n1/5th sounds like the number in UC specifically, 1/2 is the total in any LLC (honors, cbrs, etc).",

The school built a little shed for her to live in, and grounds people make sure she gets fed. Like the other person said, she\u2019s the unofficial mascot of the school, or alternatively, the campus pet.",

What if it falls in with the wrong crowd?\n\nI think each clique/category of the student body should get a cat. At the very least, each School/Program.\n\nIn both cases, the stoners should have their own cat. Who wouldn't want a lazy, cuddly cat?",

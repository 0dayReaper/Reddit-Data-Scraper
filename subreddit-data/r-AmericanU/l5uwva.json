I\u2019m pretty certain that AU is my absolute dream school, and I\u2019m, therefore, very keen on being admitted (well, duh, if it\u2019s my dream school- that\u2019s redundant \ud83d\ude02). From the perspective of a student, what do *you* think my odds of getting in are? *For context:* \n\nGPA: 3.61 (weighted- three IB\u2019s, one honors) \n\nSAT: 1120 \n\nOther: National Honor Society and Varsity Academics, (by the time I graduate) five years of Spanish credits \n\n\nIf it\u2019s of any merit, I\u2019m hoping to study Psychology. \n\nETA: although I\u2019ve seen these before, I seem to have started a trend! \ud83d\ude02",

            "comment": "Hey hi! First off, AU was also my dream school, so it's nice to see more people applying who absolutely fell in love with it lol\n\nFor context, I had a 4.5 weighted GPA (9 APS, 5 Honors) and \\~1350 SAT, and I think MOST people had around the same or lower (and I mean it gets way lower) scores/GPA. I got in regular acceptance, lots of others who loved AU got in through ED. ED tends to accept a bigger range of scores, regular acceptance seems to be a lot tighter about it. I know a handful of IB kids who got in both ways, too.\n\nI think you'll get in, but you should apply ED to increase your chances.  It's like 30% vs 70% early acceptance. Good luck, hope to see you around! (post covid lol)",

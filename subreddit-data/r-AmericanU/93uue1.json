    "postText": "Is it possible to easily graduate in 4 years with this double-major? If not, I will have to choose between the two of them. I want to continue my education into law school, and I know CLEG would be the perfect stepping stone into that. However, in the event that I choose not to attend law school, I want to have a solid education in one area. CLEG is a great major; however, I just feel like it is 4 minors combined into one major. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong. I apologize for making REDDIT my academic advisor, but I really don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do. ",

I'd highly recommend you meet with your academic advisor before you go ahead and make a final choice. \n\nI'm also going to assume you're an incoming freshman, to which I'd say that you have plenty of time to decide what to do as you work through gen-eds and early CLEG courses. I'd also suggest taking Macro and Micro economics as early as possible, they'll give you a taste of what you're in for with a Econ major. ",

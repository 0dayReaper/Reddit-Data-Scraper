    "postText": "GPA: 3.87 cumulative \nRank: 14 out of 73, used to be way higher but a math class in junior year really brought me down\nACT: 30 superscore (35 in reading, 34in english, 27 in science and 23 on math)\nClasses: Got a 4 on the APUSH exam, English honors, Algebra 3 honors, currently doing Ap us government and  AP English lit.  I would have taken more APs but i couldn\u2019t because my school in freshman year did not offered them and in my second school I couldn\u2019t take them until my second year which was junior.\n\nMy essay is strong.  It is not extremely creative like those people who make rhymes but I told i pretty good story which catches attention quickly. \n\nExtracurriculars: President of the international club, dorm liaison for the student council, dorm council, NHS, founding member of toast masters speech club and youth leg, main photographer for the year book\n\nWas invited to the Washington Journalism and Media Conference by George Mason  university and received college credit for it.\n\nVolunteer for Sanders campaign by making phone calls and sending text messages\n\nDid a clinical intership at my school by helping with the preservation of the school archives\n\nFirst language is spanish, fully fluent in english and in a second level class for french \n\nRecommendation letters by international club coordinator, the president of the boarding program and teacher of ap gov.\n\nService: Almost 40 hours.

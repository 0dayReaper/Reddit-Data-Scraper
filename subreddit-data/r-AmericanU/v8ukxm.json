Having to deal with the expense of owning a car and the nightmare that is parking is going to be overwhelming and you're not going to see any benefit from it because I seriously doubt you'll be driving from point to point within the city that much. Unless you're venturing deep into the suburbs regularly, it's going to be faster to take transit where you'll likely go as a student, and when you want to go places in the city there will rarely be ample parking for you to put your car. I wouldn't call AU the suburbs just because there are some single-family homes around...",

It\u2019s cheaper, better for the environment, and really well set up in DC in general. Plus, people in DC suck at driving.\n\nFor some off campus examples, my friend lives right by a bus stop and doesn\u2019t have a car. Her commute to class is either a 35-40 minute walk to campus or a 30 minute bus ride. I don\u2019t live near a bus station. My options are a 25-30 minute walk to campus, a 10 minute walk to a bus station + a 30 minute bus ride, or a 5 minute drive. \n\nYou will spend more on your car than you ever will on public transport if that\u2019s a consideration. It\u2019s becoming one for me with these gas prices.",

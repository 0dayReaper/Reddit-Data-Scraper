It's a decent program, and albeit small, has a lot of flexibility and opportunities for students compared to its size and enrollment. DePaul is not \"known\" for computer science, so this isn't like we're comparing American against some incredible program. \n\nI agree that cost is an important consideration. If DePaul is tremendously cheaper than AU then such should be the most important factor.",

I'm happy to hear you'll look into that option.\n\nRegarding cost -- if this is $4k in net cost (as in, you'd be $16k more in debt after completing the AU degree versus the DePaul degree), then that is not a big consideration. $16k in debt is nothing and will translate to about one extra year in working to pay off your loans. It's not a huge consideration understanding that college is 4 years of your living life versus 1 year of your working life, and thus choosing based off of where you fit in best is much more important. I think in a situation such as this, you should really pick based off which school you 'vibe' more with, be it DePaul or AU. Good luck!!",

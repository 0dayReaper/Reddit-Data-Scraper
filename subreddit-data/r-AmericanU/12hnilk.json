    "postText": "Hi, |'ve recently been admitted into AU and plan on coming to the\nadmitted students tour on April 14th. My parents can't come with\nme but I insisted on going and finding a hotel that does\naccommodations for minor (im 17), but so far its been a bust. Does AU offer any single night rooming services for something like this? / Would any students who are on campus for spring break be interested in housing me for a single night (or two depending) while I participate in the tour",

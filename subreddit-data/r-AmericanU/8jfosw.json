    "postText": "Hi everyone. I'm a student at NVCC and have been thinking about where I might like to transfer to finish my BS. I would be doing this through the guaranteed admission agreement so at this point I'm just trying to pick where I want to go. \n\nCurrently I've been looking at VCU because it's in-state and they have a good bio department and a great med school. I've been thinking about AU though, I have a lot of friends who go here and I've enjoyed myself the most here out of any campus I have friends at. I've lived near DC for a very long time and I'd love to be able to go to a fantastic school close to home. \n\nI have heard that STEM programs at AU can be lacking. It's never been my goal to go to the most prestigious bio program, I just need to go to a respected school that will challenge me and allow me to participate in undergraduate research. Is AU comparable to VCU? Or at least, do you enjoy majoring in biology (or other natural sciences) at AU?\n\nThanks. ",

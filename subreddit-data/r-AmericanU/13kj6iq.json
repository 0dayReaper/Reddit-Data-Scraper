I am a competitive ice dancer and I will need to transport to arlington va for practice 5-6 times per week from au. this is only a 15 min commute in a car, but unfortunately, au does not allow first-years to have a car on campus. does anyone have suggestions for the best way to do this? thanks.",

(that's the only rink in Arlington i know unless they built a new one without me realizing lol)\n\nif you don't want to figure out how to get and keep a car around, the MedStar rink is in a mall just a few minutes walk from the Ballston-MU metro station, which is on the orange/silver line. as someone else said, you get free metro through au which is soooo nice, but it can take a minute to do the au shuttle - &gt; red line to metro center - &gt; orange/silver line so it will definitely take more time than driving. also keep in mind that the blue line splits off before you get to Ballston.\n\nthere's also bus routes, but the metro is more reliable imo especially if you have to make transfers\n\nbeyond that, there's always uber or lyft but those can get expensive 5-6 times a week lmao\n\nwelcome to the city and to au!",

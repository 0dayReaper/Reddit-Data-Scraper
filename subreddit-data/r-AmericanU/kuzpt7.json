            "comment": "Former STEM student at AU. Now my second year working full-time professionally in data analytics. Let me offer some perspective. \n\nMajority of the student body, I think people have already mentioned, are in for Poli Sci, IR, Comm, Business etc. It\u2019s also a very PC and female-dominated school. There are charity events, social justice events every now and then on the quad. In short, not a very STEM-focused environment. Although I do see the school building up more buildings like Don Myers on East Campus and Hall of Science. However, the political culture is very unlikely to change in the short term. Good thing most of the STEM students are located on the East Campus, so we rarely hang out with the main student body. It\u2019s a small group of people so everybody KNOWS everybody. My department had 50 people and it\u2019s a tight-knit community and I really enjoyed it. \n\nAnd AU isn\u2019t particularly competitive for STEM. Professors are a hit or miss. I would say 50/50. You really have to go to Ratemyprofessor.com or their LinkedIn page to research them for you to take any of their class. And do yourself a HUGE favor, do not take ANY class from Mary Gray. She\u2019s probably the worst professor on the entire East coast. Even the good professors won\u2019t grade you harshly. I took a very hardcore Machine Learning class with Baron. Exams, quizzes were really hard, but in the end I doubt you would get a B or below if you do all your work. That\u2019s one thing they grade students very lax because there aren\u2019t many STEM students in the first place. \n\nAnother good thing for AU is It\u2019s easy to find school work. When I was attending AU I worked for the Don Myers tutoring lab for $16 an hour. I enjoyed it and built a great rapport with a lot of students even till today.  Most of the tutors really sucked and were just there to collect the paycheck. And also, it\u2019s very easy to get opportunities with the profs since the student body is so small. I know a lot of my friends in physics got FREE internships with NASA because of the program. I got an academic research with publication with my prof when I was there as well. And let me tell you, when you\u2019re looking for employment, employers look most at your experience column. If you have little to show for it, they don\u2019t care what school you graduate from. I was able to fill those columns with details due to my experience at AU, whereas it\u2019s probably 100* more competitive if you attend UMD or even GW. For that, I was able to land a job MONTHS before my friend at Georgetown did. \n\nIn short, attending AU for STEM has its pros and cons. Pros, your GPA and your work experience will look very nice if you work for it. Having AU on your resume for STEM is not a deal breaker and most of my friends in my dept have now landed jobs with Amazon, Geico, Deloitte, Booz Allen etc. So yeah, employment would not be an issue if you attend AU. \n\nCons, you will be alienated from 90% of the student body, there won\u2019t be any STEM community, events, support. The school\u2019s culture is also extremely lacking in STEM so you will feel out of place a LOT of times. Professors and talented students here are hit-and-miss. \n\nAnyways good luck.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m only a prospective student, but I would say American University is not a school that is good for STEM. AU focuses on social science majors like political science and international studies, and they\u2019re also amazing for communications and business. So I wouldn\u2019t apply if you\u2019re looking for a strong computer science program, but I do hear that the school is trying to vamp up it\u2019s STEM majors including computer science. So I think it\u2019s really a judgement call. If you\u2019re interested in combining computer science with real world social issues then it\u2019s definitely a good school for that. And, you also need to remember that you\u2019ll be in a school where they great majority of people are studying social sciences/communications/business, so you should consider if that\u2019s an academic environment you want to be in. So if you\u2019re fine being in a small, generally mediocre computer science program in a school where very little people are doing STEM, then go for it. But if you\u2019re looking for a school that is heavily invested in computer science and STEM, I wouldn\u2019t apply to AmericanU.",

            "comment": "Although AU isnt a widely known STEM school this can actually be advantageous at times. If you\u2019re intrested in getting involved in research then there isnt really any competition as long as you are able to pull the trigger and ask a professor who\u2019s work you enjoy. I\u2019m a freshman this year and and working in a chemistry lab on campus and was invited to also work in another one after expressing interest. Its not common for freshman to get involved in research that early either. This is good if you want a career in STEM or want to participate in summer programs or build connections. My professor is connected to NIST and NSF and this makes it alot easier in applying to those programs since i have a direct contact. Some computer science research positions are also paid positions if you have a work study award. The academics in STEM are ok but i think the experience is really what you pay for.",

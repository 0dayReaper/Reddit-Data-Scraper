    "postText": "Good Afternoon everyone, \n\nI am writing this because I am looking to make my decision for grad school sometime soon , I am very torn between AU and GW, with major pros and cons for each school. I was hoping to visit each university to get a feel of it, but because of COVID-19 all admitted student events are cancelled. \n\nSome background about me, I recently graduated early (December) from FIU in Miami with a dual-major BA in Asian Studies &amp; Latin American/Caribbean Studies. My research interest has long been in the overlap of the two as it relates to politics, economy and (to a lesser degree) security. I am not sure exactly what I want to do post graduation, but I am interested in either the Foreign Service or consulting. \n\nHere's the situation with each school: \n\n**American SIS**: Admitted into the CRS program with a scholy of about $3.5K a semester, I like the CRS program because it gives me a bit more flexibility given the range of area/thematic focuses available. SIS also has an awesome graduate study abroad program in Peru which is a major draw given that I want to legitimize my pretty informal Spanish. I also believe American is a bit less pricey than GW, which is very nice. Detractions from AU are that throughout the admission process they have been a bit cold-I emailed a SIS rep for some information and they didn't respond for weeks and they still haven't responded to the follow-up email I sent them after. While I love the campus (I stayed there for a summer program in high-school), it is a bit far from the center of town and I'm worried it might be difficult for me to get to (I will be living with two friends in the Rosslyn/Clarendon area). \n\n**GW Elliott School**: Admitted into the Latin American and Hemispheric Studies program (LAHS) with a nice scholy of about $6.5K a semester. Major pros is that the LAHS program has been incredibly welcoming to me, I received a call two weeks before my official admittance from the program director welcoming to the program and telling me how much he admired my essay. He's been incredibly warm and welcoming, the opposite of the distanced welcome I received from AU. I also like the GW campus, mostly because I'm very familiar with it due to an internship I was doing close-by. Cons of the GW program is that it is a little limited in scope to just Latin America, so I feel I won't have as strong a possibility to experiment with different things. GW is also a bit pricier and not all my experiences with students/alumni have been very positive. \n\nBoth programs seem to have amazing faculty and opportunities so I'm not too worried on that end. \n\n**Also**\\---completely separate from what I've been talking about above, does anyone know if the CRS program has a pre-enrollment Econ requirement? I am operating under the assumption that it doesn't because I never saw anything for it on the application and I got in just fine without having taken a Macro/Micro class in undergrad. However-I received an email from admissions entitled \"**Chat with an Academic Advisor: SIS Economics Requirement****\".** I emailed SIS about this, but like I said above, it's been three weeks and they still haven't gotten back to me (granted, there's kind of a global health emergency going on). \n\nThank you for all your help guys and please let me know if you have any questions!",

I also love the campus and the area, being in DC there\u2019s tons do and great places to eat. The best part of being an AU student is definitely the metro card, most useful thing I\u2019ve ever had. There\u2019s honestly not much I don\u2019t like about my AU experience, I\u2019m not the best to talk about the student body or anything because I am not too social. Although the dining hall food isn\u2019t great and I wish there were more chains on campus.",

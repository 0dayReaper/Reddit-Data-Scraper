You may have a friend who owns a car, and that'll come in handy if the two of you ever need to go somewhere way outside of town. An exception to all this is if you don't live close to metro \u2014 In other words, try to live close to a metro station... \n\nIf you get a bike, invest in a great bike lock \u2014 or buy cheap bikes (instead of really expensive looking ones) where it won't break your heart (and wallet) if it goes missing. I'm not writing that to make it sound like bike theft is rampant everywhere in DC, but it does happen, and the wiser among my friends ride cheap Craigslist bikes so that they can immediately get something else without losing a night's sleep over a stolen bike.",

I, like everyone else in the department, did not go to AU for CS. My advice to you is to go to a different school. The program at AU is awful. I could have gotten a better CS education just about anywhere else. Additionally, I think I\u2019m screwed when it comes to law school if I ever want to do patent law as AU is not ABET accredited.\n\nThat said, my experience at AU was otherwise positive.",

If you have owrang then you might as well stare at a rock for the semester and get the same knowledge. There are good professors japkowicz is super knowledgeable and great when it comes to research. I published a paper with her and went to italy to present the work so that was legit and learned alot and looks great on me. I went on and won top research proposal in machine learning for LM and now I get to pursue that for work. Although you have to be a good student and have a strong background in math as well to get in with her. It is what you make of it, for the average student I would say it's a garbage program and wouldn't recommend it but it's not an entire dumpster fire.",

It'll probably be pretty good in a couple years, but it only just kicked off with the new STEM building that has a bunch of physics/engineering labs being built about a year and a half ago. \n\nAlso shout outs to Ford, and to Kristof who is the head of the Design and Build lab at AU, but helps out the comp sci department all the same. \n\nAU's program is modest, and nothing compared to, for example, Stanford's state-of-the-art programs and laboratories. Doesn't diminish the work put in by the professors who are there now, but if you're looking for CS, I'd check out school's that are currently more focused on engineering and thus more well funded for what you are seeking out. \n",

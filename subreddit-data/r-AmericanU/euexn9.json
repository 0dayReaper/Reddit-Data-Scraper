    "postText": "Hi friends,\nI didn\u2019t go to American but I would love to use the library as I live nearby and I\u2019m studying for an entrance exam. If I were to drive to AU, would it be possible to get parking somewhat near the main library? Also I heard the library is open to non affiliates and I was wondering if this is true.",

Parking at AU is terrible, especially since they built East Campus where the giant lot used to be.\n\nThere are free shuttles that take you from the metro to various points on campus.\n\nDunno about non-affiliates but you could give them a call and find out. They're super nice!",

BUT if you're staying in the library with the books it shouldn't be a problem and if you need to print you can get a temp card or go to Tech Services for help. If you live in the area, the library also allows community members to pay a small fee and get a library card, sorry I don't recall the details of that program. \n\nThe info desk or circulation desk are the best places to visit if you have questions.",

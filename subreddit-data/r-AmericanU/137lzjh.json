    "postText": "I\u2019ve heard rumors that campus has very inactive clubs and a lack of activities. I have also heard that American has less party culture and more bar/night out culture because Greek life is very small. I am actually looking for less Greek life so that\u2019s a plus for me, but if the campus activities and clubs aren\u2019t active then I\u2019m worried about being bored all the time.\n\nWhat do you think? How true is this? \n\nThank you! :)",

There are some that are inactive too of course but you can for sure find active ones. I know people really into and active in student media clubs, arts clubs, political clubs, and club sports. As far bar/party culture goes I\u2019m not part of it but I think it is what you make it. I\u2019ve had roommates go out to dc clubs every weekend it\u2019s a city so there\u2019s always going to be at least a few clubs.",

Definitely true we have more of a bar/clubbing culture than party culture bc Greek life is super small. But you can definitely find a frat party if you want to.",

            "comment": "Parent of a recent grad.  It has its issues--but all schools do.  We had a very good experience. There were some administrative glitches (billing, financial aid, etc) but they worked to resolve. \n\nMy kid was in Anderson (F), McDowell (S), and Cassel (J,S) and never had any real issues. But the rooms got progressively better as the dorms got newer.  There were a few roach and mice sightings in Anderson.  She was out of there when they had fire alarm issues--been resolved, but definitely irritating and a distraction.\n\nThe school definitely leans left and liberal, but not to the point where a right leaning conservative would feel unsafe or terribly out of place.  There was (and to a degree still is) a number of racial incidents on the campus (which actually surprised me) and the Admin really did a poor job addressing it IMHO.  They hired a guy to facilitate racial harmony, sent out statements condemning incidents, and created a \"safe space\" for people of color. They definitely could do more!\n\nAs to being far from the City...absolutely not. It is one of the safest sections of the City and with tuition comes a Metro Card that gives you unlimited rides on Metro bus or subway. The school runs the WONK Bus to the Tenleytown pretty much consistently ,where the nearest metro station is--that is walkable as well.\n\nEducation. Zero complaints here. Daughter graduated right into a good paying job in her field. Profs were good and able and willing to guide her along the way. Granted you need to seek the help--they are not coming to you. Internships are plentiful and most are paid.\n\nIn all, DC is a wonderful, vibrant town with a TON of opportunities if you seek them out.",

            "comment": "I just graduated, so I have a perspective that is the proper combination of fresh and sufficiently jaded. I write on the assumption the world is normal and you actually *go* to a school.\n\nI think there are a lot of valid reasons to complain about AU, but I think students (people in general) like to focus on the things they dislike more than they like. You\u2019re going to see more discussions about complaints than good things because, as a human phenomenon, complaints just generate more discussion rather than praise, so it\u2019s not an accurate assessment of the school\u2019s good-bad ratio. Furthermore, I think a lot of the complaints, while valid, aren\u2019t exclusive to AU, but more a result of just how colleges unfortunately operate most of the time, so you\u2019re gonna get some of these problems in *some* capacity, regardless of where you go. So that\u2019s something to keep in mind.\n\nI think \u201csubpar education\u201d, from my perspective, is an egregiously incorrect assessment. There are absolutely some bad professors, those who are too strict or don\u2019t know how to teach or have some other problems. But, in my experience at least, the vast majority have been great (or at the very least, good enough). AU is branded as a school for those who want to do politics, but the pointless hill that I\u2019ll die on is that AU\u2019s actual purpose is to be a microcosm of all the best things that America produces\u2014the best politicians and journalists, yes, but also the best artists and businesspeople and best scientists and best researchers and best historians, etc.\u2014and aims to have excellent instruction in all of those fields. I came to AU to study politics in part because they mentioned how a lot of professors are experienced in the field and have worked in and out of dc politics, and that\u2019s been great: I\u2019ve had professors who worked in the gay rights movement and the federal reserve and so on. But when I decided to move to art, I realized it was still true there: my professors are very involved in both the DC and national theatre (one of them is one of the most famous playwrights/directors in the country). You see AU Professors consulted as experts in the media a lot of a reason. Apart from a few hiccups, I\u2019m very satisfied with the education the school provided. If you want to do IR and/or economics, AU is an excellent location.\n\nThe administration is definitely a sore spot. It does a lot of stupid things, and rarely it seems like they do something good unless they\u2019ve been prompted to by the students. By the same token, though, I don\u2019t know how much good they do when I\u2019m not paying attention to them, since I\u2019m\u2026 not paying attention, unless something bad happens. So I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re not getting credit for things they should be getting credit for. Meanwhile, my dad works at an Ivy League college, and always talks about how bad the administration is, which is why I maintain that you probably aren\u2019t going to be fond of the administration regardless of where you go, though admittedly I don\u2019t know what students and other schools think.\n\nI can\u2019t comment on dorms too much. I hear they\u2019ve renovated the freshman dorms, but I also had few issues with them. I have a pretty minimal set of needs or standards when it came to dorm life, though, so I wouldn\u2019t listen to me too much in that regard. \n\nDistance is really not that bad. There\u2019s a shuttle that takes you straight to the metro, and from there it\u2019s not that far. Plus, there are buses in the Tenleytown area that can get you into the city easily. I\u2019ve had multiple internships in DuPont Circle, and they both were pretty quick trips. Incidentally, DC *does* obviously have a lot of public affairs institutions and organizations for you to intern at, which is great for skill building and networking and career starting, though that\u2019s only a plus if AU is the only DC school you\u2019re looking at. \n\nUltimately, you\u2019re not gonna get an accurate read on the school by browsing reddit discussions (I say as someone who did the same thing in 12th grade). You\u2019re only gonna get feedback and information from people who make it a point to contribute to things, and those are typically the people who have *feelings* about the topic that they need to share\u2014myself included (my feelings being, \u201cpeople have a right to complain, but they direct their complaints badly\u201d)\u2014so this is obviously not an accurate cross section of the school, campus culture, or what going there will be like; I have biased opinions on the matter, just like everyone, and I always worry that the advice I give based on that bias might inadvertently lead some astray. \n\nHere\u2019s my last thought: AU isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s a good school with a frustrating administration. If you don\u2019t expect to deal with them too much\u2014for financial reasons or disability reasons or other things\u2014you\u2019ll probably be fine. If you suspect that you\u2019ll need assistance with things beyond education, dig deeper and determine if they\u2019ll cause problems or not.",

            "comment": "I was there before AU started the \"Wonk\" campaign and tightened it's admissions (I was part of the first \"transition\" class, as AU tried to move away from a school for stoners who rail against the system to a school that tries to compete with GW and Georgetown for the children of the elite), so the most grating part of freshman year was hearing from all the kids who *should've* gotten into Georgetown or got waitlisted and had to settle. Don't know if that's still a thing. \n\nI got lucky and got a ton of need-based financial aid and graduated with less than the national average in student loan debt. But my takeaway that I've communicated here before is that while I think I got a great education, had some truly great professors and love DC, AU is not worth anywhere near the full cost of tuition. Do not go into a hundred thousand dollars + of debt for an  undergrad degree.\n\nYou can get as good an education at a cheaper school (yes, even in undergraduate-level IR), and if working somewhere in DC is your dream, you can make summer internships work and still walk away with far less debt and a competitive entry-level resume. \n\nComplaints about housing or dining, based on my time there, can just be chalked up to kids complaining about relatable topics because it's easy conversation.",

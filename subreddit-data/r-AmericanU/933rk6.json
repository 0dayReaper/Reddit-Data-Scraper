    "postText": "I\u2019m trying to decide whether I will pursue a degree in CLEG or a degree in finance at Kogod. I am very interested in the CLEG program, but I don\u2019t really know what jobs will be available to me after school. I really don\u2019t want to be working at a non-profit activist group, making less then $45k a year. Finance interest me as well, albeit not as much as the material covered in CLEG. Any suggestions??? ",

At the end of the day, if you put in the work, either degree will be sufficient for you to pursue work in government/policy/business, but (imo) CLEG would give you a more well-rounded education, especially if you\u2019re considering graduate school.

Personally I ended up choosing CLEG as I\u2019m not certain what I want to do after school, and CLEG seemed to give me more flexibility and a broader scope of interests to explore. ",

            "comment": "I was you my Freshman year. I obviously decided finance was better for me but that is ultimately a decision only you can make. My decision was largely centered around the FACT that you can get a job/internship on the hill or for an executive branch agency and go to law school with a finance degree. It is significantly harder to get into finance without that concentration in school. Whatever you decide you will ultimately be happy with. Another thing to consider is the political leanings of the schools. Kogod, especially the finance department is pretty conservative and not largely politically concerned. SPA is politically obsessed and incredibly liberal.",

Would I be wasting my money majoring in finance at AU? Quite frankly, I am interested in both majors. I am just worried I won\u2019t know where to work if I don\u2019t go to law school if I major in CLEG. I need to make a good living-wage, while paying back student loans.",

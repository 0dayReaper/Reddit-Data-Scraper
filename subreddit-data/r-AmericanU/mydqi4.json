No questions ask they let me, I just had to ask my counselor for a form which she then passes to the head of my major department, it took less than a week for them to let me off. And if I so desired to i just would have to fill another form to take the next semester off (Two temporary leaves seems to be the limit). So with a medical reason I am more than sure that they will give you the go ahead.",

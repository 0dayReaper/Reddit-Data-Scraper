I logged into my Eagle Portal last night and noticed that they changed my major from Elementary Education to Public Health, so I'm beginning to speculate that I got into the PH Scholars program.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCould anyone (hopefully in or was in the program) give some insight into the experience? Did you double major? Did you go the medical route? What opportunities have you received?",

There's a way people found out if they got in or not. Some people activated their student accounts which are only possible if you're admitted.

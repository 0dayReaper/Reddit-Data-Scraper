    "postText": "Hi guys, I'm a freshman, but I only completed my Fall 2022 semester, I was doing my spring semester but had to take it off due to family issues. I've been looking for information about how easy it is to get in with my current stats but I get mixed information.\n\nHS Stats: 4.0 GPA(UW), 4.22 GPA (W), Rank #1, No test scores, significant Work experience in a foreign country (I've been working since I was 14, and I'm currently 19), Strong student government and activism extracurriculars (Host of an event on Women's day and winning research paper in economic sustainability during Senior year of HS), good recommendations\n\nCollege Stats: 3.46 GPA, 12 credits + AP Calc BC credits (4), strong student government activities (Elected as treasurer and first-year senator of my college's leading governance association, Allocated 1.1 million for my college's student organization, leader of residential life committee (All in 1st semester in a top liberal arts college). good recommendations.\n\nI'm also worried about financial aid because the maximum I can pay out of pocket is 5000 (My EFC is 3400 and my family's income is 62k) and I'm not sure how financial aid is handled for transfers here)",

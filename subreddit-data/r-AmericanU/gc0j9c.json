    "postText": "  Hello all!\n\nI am making a documentary about how the **COVID-19 pandemic has been affecting college students** across the country and would love to hear from as many voices as possible. So, if you feel comfortable filming yourself speaking about the issue, please reach out!\n\nSome of the stories I wish to highlight include:\n\n\\- Seniors \n\n\\- Freshmen\n\n\\- Grad students/PhD candidates\n\n\\- Folks in very hands-on majors that are virtually impossible to adapt to distance learning\n\n\\- Students who have had to drop classes/significantly change their academic paths due to the crisis\n\n\\-Students who were/are studying abroad\n\n\\- Students who have attempted to/have gotten refunded for the semester\n\n\\- Students who are not eligible for stimulus packages/financial assistance\n\n\\- Students who have a hard time with online classes (can\u2019t focus, poor wi-fi at home, time zones, etc\u2026)\n\nBut I do not wish to limit my search to just the above! If you have a story to tell, I want to hear it. Please message me directly if you are interested in being a part of this project. All filming and producing will, at least for now, be done remotely.\n\nMany thanks, and stay at home,\n\nSam",

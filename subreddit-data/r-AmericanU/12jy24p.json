Is it worth it? For context i also received offers from GW honors college, northeastern, carelton and some other schools and Im having trouble making a decision.",

            "comment": "Hey! Im a second year in global scholars! I think it really depends on what you are looking for. Basically you do live with the other global scholars as a first year and for some that can be very helpful for making friends/connections. You also do take a couple classes with the other scholars in the first year. Over the first year summer, you have the opportunity to study abroad for six weeks in Spain and Belgium (with other global scholars/3 year programs) You do get to graduate in three years. However consider other things as well, I wouldn\u2019t make global scholars the only reason you choose AU but it doesn\u2019t hurt.\nFeel free to dm if you have questions",

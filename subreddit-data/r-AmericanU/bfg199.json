Are people friendly? \nAre the food and the dorms really that bad?\nIs the workload too overwhelming? \nDo the professors care?\nDo you feel like you\u2019re in a bubble?\nPlease any information would really help!

            "comment": "Good questions. I was considering GW myself when I decided to apply ED to American. The main reason I chose AU was the campus. If you want a traditional college campus feeling, AU will deliver that way more than GW. That said, GW is directly in the city, so if you want something that blends right in, GW may be better. You definitely get the \"bubble\" feeling you mentioned since AU is self-contained.\n\nAs far as what's best for your major choice, either is good, and poli sci was the degree I went for at American. It kind of depends on what you want to do with the major afterwards. AU's career center is OK, but if you want to get a job on the Hill or work at a think tank, it's not as well equipped in terms of connections. They do provide networking opportunities and the school's Handshake page is pretty helpful.\n\nYou definitely don't need to be in Greek life to find parties or make friends. I never did that, and was able to go to get-togethers and smaller parties. That said, the large parties will be hosted by frats since they can gather a lot of people. But those parties aren't all that fun to be honest.\n\nI generally found people to be pretty cool at AU. There will always be \"fake\" people or those not worth your attention wherever you go, but most people I met were fine. It's a female-majority campus, so there's plenty of people to meet. In terms of diversity it's a bit of a mixed bag. It's an expensive school in an affluent area, so a lot of wealthier white people as well as wealthy ex-pats from other countries go there. \n\nDorm life is alright at AU. My personal opinion is to get off campus as soon as you can. It's cheaper in the long run and if you are willing to walk to campus you can find some cheaper places nearby. Just don't live at the Berks or Avalon--they're not worth it unless you can get a lot of people to split a place. Because it's a bit of a bubble, you kind of have to live with the food options on campus, which are so-so. DC has so much to offer, so it's not a major concern in my opinion.\n\nI had a great experience with the poli sci faculty, though with any school it's going to vary from professor to professor. They're always open to talking about the class or anything, and office hours were worth it in my experience. The workload is definitely not bad, but if you're not careful with your course planning you could end up over-doing it. Again, it varies from professor to professor.\n\nHappy to answer any more questions!",

            "comment": "I applied and was accepted to both. Chose AU because it had more of a traditional campus feel than GW. That said, both school's are great. I wound up getting my Masters at GW a few years later. IMO can't go wrong with either, but definitely visit both campuses and get a feel for each as they're very different.  Both schools tend to pull both similar student populations, but I graduated a while back so can't comment on how either school is now as far as cliques or the importance of Greek life. Found both student populations friendly.",

            "comment": "I am someone who comes from the opposite background of cliques and \u201csorority\u201d type girls and have loved my time at AU. While those people exist, they in no way make up the entire population of people, and they don\u2019t have enough power socially to really effect your life from a social standpoint. Also, the food is NOT bad especially considering it is a college dining hall. The dining hall makes a strong effort to have foods of all kinds, each night, representing all genres and nationalities of food. The dorms are also very nice, specifically Anderson hall (freshman dorms). I was very surprised at how nice it was, and of all the people I knew in college, I had by far the nicest dorm building if that gives any insight. Also, you can feel a part of a real campus which is truly comforting and builds a sense of community- something that, while initially GW might sound better since it\u2019s right in the most urban part of the city, I think AU having a campus actually is something that is very beneficial as a student. I have never gotten a bubbled in feeling- the metro is a short bus ride away and another major plus is the U pass (unlimited metro rides included in your tuition) that no other school in dc has. You can take a metro bus all outside campus or ride the metro directly as many times as you want, traveling wherever you want in dc, without having to pay out of your pocket. Then, you can go from anywhere in the city back to campus, which really feels like home since again, it is a true campus space. \nGood luck with your decision! I hope this helps.",

AU has more of a traditional campus and for Poly Sci it\u2019s about the same with GW. Around 1/3 of my friends managed to find internship on the hills so that shouldn\u2019t be a problem for you. With the U pass, it saves you so much money if you wanna use the metro to commute.",

There\u2019s also a lot of students here on scholarship so you do meet students with different Social economic status. A huge LGBT population too. Hayley Kiyoko just gave a concert here.",

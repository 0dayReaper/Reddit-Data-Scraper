International Studies alone will get you into the State Department, and some basic policy jobs, but if you want to make money off of the major, combine it with either an economics or business major, and you should be setting yourself up to make substantial money in salary.

I know people who have done everything from working in one of the intelligence services as an analyst to working in government relations for a large multinational. It is a very versatile combination that allows you to specialize in a specific field that is widely applicable in the world today. Obviously the better you do in school, the better your income prospects are on graduation. \n\nIn terms of what to put on a resume, the answer isn't really what will impress AU insomuch what will impress an admissions officer. Stuff to stick on your resume are things that allow you stand out from the crowd. Obviously you have to put some standard information on there, but make sure to include things that you have done that aren't necessarily things that a lot of people have also done. For example, I have a hobbies and interest section of my resume, and on there is a section talking about how I rode my bike from Georgia to LA. Thats the sort of thing that makes you stand out to a recruiter. You want to be more than just application #284923, you want to be a real person that they can A, relate to, and B, sticks in their mind. I remember when I was visiting colleges, a rep from Connecticut College was telling us how there was a girl, who for her essay wrote about how she is like tofu. Like tofu, she always sucks up what's around her. From that point on in the admissions process she was known as tofu girl, and she got a offer to attend. You want to stick out, so put something on there that you've done that seems different, something that distinguishes you from the crowd. ",

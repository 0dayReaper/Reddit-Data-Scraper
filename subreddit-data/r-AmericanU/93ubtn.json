    "postText": "I\u2019m going into the Master\u2019s literature program. From what I\u2019ve seen the department is quite small. Is there chance to mix with other departments/many different people as a master\u2019s student or are the schools pretty socially divided? I went to a very small BA program before and I don\u2019t want to feel socially limited as is often the case at small student bodies. ",

Also there were some classes that overlap. Hope this helps",

            "comment": "I didn\u2019t tour before I applying at any colleges nor before accepting at AU. I got extremely lucky\u2014it\u2019s a meme, but it\u2019s also a fact that GWU doesn\u2019t really have a campus. I find it to be a big difference. The social events, general atmosphere, etc are all really enhanced by our quad and the layout of the place.\n\nThat said, you\u2019ll get more name rec outside of the DMV going to GWU, if that matters. Everyone in and around DC knows AU. Educationally, it\u2019s my understanding that they\u2019re pretty similar. What program(s) are you looking at?\n\nI\u2019ll also add that I think the club scene at AU is very good. There\u2019s a lot of good ways to get involved in and around campus, and I found them to be a place where I felt included and I made a lot of friends in clubs/orgs.",

                            "comment": "AU\u2019s School of Communication is actually a really underrated school. There\u2019s a lot of big names in SOC and having taken a few classes there, it\u2019s the real deal. I\u2019ve taken classes with a speechwriter for HW Bush, the head of one of the branches of Bloomberg News, and a head lawyer at PBS. I\u2019m not a big comms or journalism guy, but the classes are really well done.\n\nAdditionally, I think AU really shines in its grad programs. I\u2019m in a combined BA/MPA program, which saves you a year of time and tuition (you take grad courses during senior year of undergrad, plus no GRE or application fees), which might be something to consider too. I\u2019ve heard the SOC grad programs are really great, if you\u2019ve thought at all about doing anything beyond undergrad. Also, The Eagle is a really, really well-run student newspaper and I know plenty of people there who\u2019ve gotten into great jobs and internships because of their work with the paper.\n\nAlso gotta agree with down below, UPass is incredible. I work 4 days a week and last semester I worked 5 days a week downtown. I\u2019m saving hundreds of dollars having UPass",

            "comment": "They\u2019re pretty similar schools, pretty much on the same calibre. GW kids tend to think they\u2019re much better than us but within DMV we\u2019re almost recognized as the same type of school and outside of DMV they\u2019re only SLIGHTLY more recognized than AU. The only advantage they have over AU is they do have an engineering schoook and a med school, and a partner hospital, and AU doesn\u2019t. \n\nThings AU has that GW doesn\u2019t. Well, AU does have a beautiful campus, quads, lawns. GW is in an urban area with office workers, firefighters, patrol cars. They don\u2019t really have a campus. They don\u2019t even have a public gathering for students outside of maybe in front of Gelman? And btw, since they\u2019re in downtown the location attracts sometimes the wrong type of people. For example, you wouldn\u2019t want someone playing drums for money outside your dorms or your classrooms. When i was tutoring at SEAS I literally saw a homeless guy washing up in their bathroom. Oh boy, did their Internet suck. GWireless or GWConnect. \n\nLike I said, it totally depends on your program. For IR, Poly Sci, both schools are on the same calibre, so I would say pick whatever your preference. For STEM, go for GW. Their engineering and med school are pretty well-known in the DMV area, that\u2019s why they have better employment stats, but not by much. \n\nI personally really enjoyed AU because really like the student body and the professors. The students here at AU are passionate, career-driven, more down-to-earth than GW students. The campus is beautiful. The professors are great (my program was statistics/data analytics). I worked for the Don Myers building at the tutoring lab and boy do I miss those days. \n\nThat said, I worked part-time as a math tutor and a LOT of my clients are from GW, for that reason, I frequent their \u201ccampus\u201d a lot. So yeah, I have a lot of experience with GW kids and their \u201ccampus\u201d. They\u2019re not as bright as they think. I got hired within a month and a half with my AU degree currently working near McPhearson Square in downtown DC, I know GW kids unemployed for almost a year. So I would say, college is what you make of it at the end.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention, Upass was the GOAT. I\u2019ve known jealous GW kids wanting to buy the Upass from AU students.",

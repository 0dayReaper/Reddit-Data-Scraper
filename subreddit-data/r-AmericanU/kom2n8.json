Between COVID and a bit of a national reckoning with sexual assault, greek life at AU isn't in a very good spot.  Frats here are (or at least were) also generally around 30-40 people after the spring pledge class, its not a traditional experience.  If you decide to, go through rush with a open mind.  Even at a state school, it barely affects your future.",

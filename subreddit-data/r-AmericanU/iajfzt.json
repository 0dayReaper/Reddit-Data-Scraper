            "comment": "The foreign service is incredibly competitive. It\u2019s a great gig that nearly every one of your peers at AU will describe as their \u201cdream job\u201d. \n\nAs far as other jobs are concerned, it\u2019s impossible to tell what the job market will look like in 4 years. I had a job before I graduated, but I have students that have been looking for a few months with little luck. \n\nThe best way you can prepare for your future career now is to really work on your writing skills and your understanding of statistics. This is not pointed advice, but general advice for anyone in college or about to start.",

There are infinite jobs out there that you could do, and deriving happiness/success/satisfaction is possible anywhere. Go to college and become a well rounded individual that gives a shit about *something*, and learn to define yourself in ways other than work.",

Clubs typically meet online or rarely. \nBoth schools are left leaning but AU is significantly more liberal. Also, GWU is in a much better location for you to enjoy all that DC has to offer. Students at GW also tend to be more \u201cnormal\u201d imo in terms of the way the dress and act. \nSource: I\u2019m an AU student who is transferring",

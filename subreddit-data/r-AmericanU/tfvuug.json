Some of the people here are really insufferable and rude with their obsession with masks and testing, but it should be better by the fall because we are going mask optional on Monday.\n\nAs for campus life, it\u2019s great. There\u2019s a club fair in the fall and everyone is really nice and welcoming. I\u2019m in the Political Review Magazine which is a lot of fun. There is basically something for everyone here",

            "comment": "Congrats!! I'm a senior Journalism major and I loved it. The program is great, the professors are great, and the internship opportunities in DC are incredible. I was in a sorority freshman/sophomore year until we chose to dissolve the chapter. I'm grateful that my sorority helped connect me with people, but honestly there are so many clubs and activities on campus that it is not worth rushing when you could absolutely find a different place to bond with people over actual shared interests instead of forced \"sisterhood.\" If you really want to rush, though, you'll find info in the fall and rush before  spring semester freshman year. I would also recommend joining The Eagle. It's a student-run newspaper that recently won a few national awards. It's great to get a foot in at a news org early on so you have clips for whenever you want to start applying for jobs/internships. Also, the community there is even better than my experience with a sorority community.",

It\u2019s the cleanest and newest freshmen dorm, and it\u2019s easy to make friends bc that\u2019s where most freshmen are (or in Letts, which is connected to Anderson but a little older). My year it was mostly reserved for LLCs like University College but idk if that\u2019s changed since 2018. And as far as other clubs go, there\u2019s a big club fair on the quad early in fall semester. I\u2019d go to that and honestly join whatever interests you! It doesn\u2019t really matter what the club is per se, but you\u2019ll find the most connection and make the best friends if you give 100% to anything you join. There are tons of communities everywhere (student media, student government, campus jobs, clubs, activist groups, etc.) so just go with your gut on what sounds fun to you, go all in and you\u2019ll definitely find like minded people",

It\u2019s really just a personal preference on whether you want a more private or public bathroom space. Also not sure if there are LLCs for Centennial.

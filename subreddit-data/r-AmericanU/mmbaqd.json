    "postText": "hi everyone, \n\ni\u2019m an admitted student who is a prospective audio tech major. It seems that AU has a great program with good graduate outcomes, but I would really like to hear from any current students in the program (or the audio production program) and their opinions on it! \n\nAU is my top choice but it is definitely pricey for me and my family. I\u2019m planning to appeal for more aid but i don\u2019t have super high hopes for what i\u2019ll get. My second choice is Temple University (which would be at least 10k/yr cheaper than AU) but I don\u2019t love not having an actual campus and it seems like their audio technology and production programs aren\u2019t as good. \n\nAny feedback would be appreciated! I would like to connect with other newly admitted students who are interested in audio tech as well, if there\u2019s anyone else on here :)",

The fact is, your success in the audio world is going to be independent of having a degree. \n\nI initially came to AU for audio tech. It\u2019s a great program with great faculty and great staff. I switched to Physics and never looked back. AU is a great school. If you like it, and money isn\u2019t an issue, come.",

            "comment": "Actually Temple does offer a campus experience, even though it's in the middle of Philadelphia.  There's also two solid audio production programs too: Music Technology &amp; Media Studies and Production.  Another plus side for finances is Philly's cost-of-living is much lower than DC!  Good luck!",

Did I just get the wrong impression, are the buildings not that spread out? \n\nAlso thank you for your reply, it\u2019s very helpful. I applied for the media studies and production major and was worried that it was too broad for me and I wouldn\u2019t have the same opportunities to focus on audio production as I would with AU.",

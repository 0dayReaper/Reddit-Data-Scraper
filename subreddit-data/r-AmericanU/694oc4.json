    "postText": "I am an alumni and am interested to know what is going on at campus. Are people shocked? Has the student culture really become so toxic, or is this likely a surprising lone actor? It sounds like this isn't the first time these types of actions have been taken. How are people reacting on campus? \n\nVery sad to see this. Frankly I'm also a little surprised and disappointed to see that this wasn't already a topic of discussion, though there was motivation enough to complain about a frat fundraiser having to change a party theme out of perceived bad taste last week... it isn't inspiring much confidence...

And they are getting just that. And I'd be super surprised if anything comes from this investigation but hopefully something does.\n\nNot saying it wasn't terrible what they did but I think it's just someone looking to get a reaction from people.",

Like the bait is free because Harambe is dead? I don't know if that's at all true but if it is this might have been blown out of proportion. \n\nOverall though, this isn't the usual campus climate.. just another incident in a string of outliers, probably done by a shitty human.

Also, if there were enough members, students could get together and charter boats in the Chesapeake, etc. This probably isn't the best way to find out info since this subreddit is hardly active, but any information about starting a club would be helpful.

Be prepared to have a bunch of old male professors interested in joining you.\n\nAlso I was not aware it was safe to eat fish from the Potomac. Learn something new every day.",

You can also find them on the second floor of MGC (near the student government offices). [Here](http://www.auclubcouncil.com/) is their website, and I hope all goes well!",

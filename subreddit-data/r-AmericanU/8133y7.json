But if you're doing this you pretty much have no soul and shouldn't worry about people judging you.\n\nAbout the last hour and a half for both gyms (Cassell closes an hour earlier at 11) have few people. This is usually when I go. I'm the guy with black hair in a bun, probably grey and yellow shorts, feel free to say hi. \n\nDon't have much experience with this time, but when I've gone during peak class hours (11am-2pm ish) there's few people around. \n\nAnd honestly dude, most no one cares about your workout. Most of the regulars are pretty chill. Everyone else is looking at themselves in the mirror just as much as you are. Just do what you go there to do. ",

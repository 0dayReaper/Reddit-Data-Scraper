The only concern I have is that it's not as prestigious as my other options and won't be the best choice to get me into law school. I know that this is a really toxic mindset I have, I wish it didn't matter to me, but since I want to go to a top law school, I want to be sure AU will set me on that path.

I honestly don\u2019t know a lot about law school but I\u2019d say to really think about what you want to spend your undergrad studying/doing before law school. If you\u2019re interested in politics and want to do something related to it with your law degree then SPA is a really fantastic school and the connections you\u2019ll make/people you\u2019ll meet at AU/in DC will be really valuable. It\u2019s prolly not worth it to go somewhere with slightly better name recognition if they don\u2019t have good programs/networks for what you want to do in your undergrad. What you do during your undergrad is probably gonna have a much bigger impact on your law school admissions than the difference between AU being the school at the top of your resume and northeastern being the school at the top of your resume.\n\nAgain, don\u2019t know a lot about law school but just make sure wherever you go is gonna serve you well academically/professionally in your undergrad. If AU feels right to you then I\u2019d say you should come here :)\n\nI also know the Washington college of law is quite a good school, not sure if it\u2019s the level of prestige you\u2019re looking for in your law school though.\n\nAlso think about where you want to be location wise. If you care about politics then DC really is the right place to be.\n\nAnyways, good luck and I hope you\u2019re celebrating getting into all those schools that\u2019s a big deal!!! :)",

From what I understand/have read (it\u2019s been awhile since I made my decision) it\u2019s very easy to change majors/minors within your school (the Elliot school for example) but it requires department approval an both sides to double major or do a minor in two different schools. At AU you don\u2019t have to officially declare your major until sometime in sophomore year, although it can of course be difficult if you\u2019ve been taking all classes for SIS and then you want to switch to something totally different. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s true at GW as well, but at AU you can only take classes from the school you\u2019re currently enrolled in (it\u2019s not direct admit but you do need to choose a school to operate within even before you declare a major, it\u2019s just really easy to jump between schools/double major/do minors in different schools, etc).\n\nI don\u2019t know anyone at GW so most of this is just based on what I remember from when I applied, so take it with a grain of salt. I just got more of a liberal arts/jump around schools vibe from AU. The other biggest thing id say is locations/campuses. GW is nice because it\u2019s right in the middle of foggy bottom, but it doesn\u2019t have a real campus/quad. AU is nice because it has a real campus/quad, but it\u2019s not right in the middle of the city. GW is also bigger than AU (quite a few more total students, for undergrad it\u2019s 8 or 9 thousand at AU vs 11 or 12 thousand at GW). People will bicker about their rankings (AU is currently ranked as the best school of public affairs in DC, for example) but realistically AU/GW/GTown are all amazing schools for anything political. I\u2019d mostly go off of the vibes you get from the school which is probably mostly based on location/campus :)\n\nAnd if one is cheaper by a significant margin, I would probably just go there lol. They were essentially gonna cost the same for me since I got more merit from GW.",

                            "comment": "Congratulations on getting accepted so many great places.  I graduated from AU as a poli sci and justice &amp; law dual major a few years ago before I went on to law school at USC (and now beyond).  I also did some LSAT teaching and law school application advising for a short period so I'm familiar with both applying to law schools from AU and also the broader application process.\n\nEvery law school is a little different and they are all changing and tweaking their acceptance process each year but there are general rules that apply to almost every law school when you're thinking about building a resume.  Before I talk about AU specifically, I think you first need to understand the general outline of how schools choose applicants, even though you are years away from applying at this point.\n\nThe first and most important thing to understand is that most of the work done by the back end of law school admissions departments is statistics.  They receive 1000s of applications every year and they want to ensure that class sizes remain moderately stable while getting the highest possible candidates possible.  How do you accomplish that?  A detailed model which estimates the expected acceptance rate of various groups based on past patterns, acceptance rates at other law schools, and much more.  Essentially law schools are trying to find the perfect balance where they raise the on-paper quality of their students without messing up commonly used measures of quality like acceptance rate or class size.\n\nSo when you are applying to a law school your application will go through a bunch of steps to try and quantify both your quality as a student and your likelihood of accepting an offer to attend their school.  In many ways, law school admissions departments are actually *more* concerned with what *other* schools are doing.  This is because if they offer too many spots to individuals who are not receiving offers from better schools, their class size will balloon.  Conversely, if most of their offers go to individuals who have also been accepted at a higher ranked school, they won't get enough students.\n\nThere's a lot more that goes into this (waitlists, late acceptance conversion rates due to students accepting elsewhere, scholarships) but understanding that basic information is most important to understanding the rest of the process and how it applies to you.  So let's talk about exactly what schools are looking for when they receive your application...\n\n1. The first pass is about pure numbers.  A school will set aside those who clearly exceed their standards, those who fall in the middle, and those that are well below the mark.  In reality, the groups may be even more granular than that but basically they are dividing up applicants into \"definitely will receive an offer from a better school,\" \"may receive an offer elsewhere in our prestige range,\" and \"we will almost certainly be their best offer.\"  The main numbers at this point are always gonna be your LSAT and GPA.  LSAC will do some GPA adjustment under the auspices of getting everyone to a 4.0 scale but, for the most part, on this first pass, your raw numbers are what matters.  If your LSAT and GPA well exceed their requirements then the rest of your application generally just needs to not raise any red flags and you'll get accepted.  If you're above their requirements but not by a large margin (say you have a great GPA but middling LSAT or vice versa) or if you're anywhere below that your application will move on to the next step...\n2. They will then look at prestige and experiential factors.  What school did you go to?  What was your degree (there's a ton of poli sci majors that apply to law school but schools want more diversity in degrees)?  Do you have anything on your resume that is particularly impressive (leadership positions, impressive internships, real-world work experience, truly unique experiences, etc.)?  At the end of this step, the school generally has a list of people that they feel are the top applicants either based on raw numbers or good numbers (relative to the school) with a great resume.\n3. Finally schools will look at the remaining details of the remaining applicants.  Schools will differ greatly on how they deal with this part of the process and this is where details are the most lacking.  However, most seem to look at applications fairly holistically once they are at this stage.  This means essay, recommendations, GPA, school, extracurriculars, internships, work experience, life experience/overcome hardship, connections to the area or lack thereof (both can be good), work ethic, reading and writing skills... all of it comes in and is considered to find the people most likely to succeed in law school and beyond.  It's worth noting that at this point, the school has used its model to figure out how many of the applicants they have found in the first few steps are likely to accept their offer.  The school has an idea of how many spots they have remaining...roughly.  They still expect a portion of the remaining students to possibly go elsewhere (those in the \"may receive an offer elsewhere\" category) and account for that but, on the whole, they expect a good portion of these students to come to their school based on scholarship numbers, prestige, etc.\n\nThere is a lot more that goes into this obviously.  Schools play a lot of games so that they can assess their class and other schools' classes as they go.  Acceptance \"waves\", waitlists, and delayed scholarship offers are all tools that are used by admissions departments to gather information and tweak their expected class size/quality as they go.  Additionally, there are a few schools that use much different selection processes (UC Berkley and Harvard for example) but generally, the above information gives you a very basic sense of how the process functions.\n\nOk. So all of that out of the way, how does this apply to you and AU?\n\nWell first, if, relative to the law school, your GPA (raw and adjusted) is great and you score high on the LSAT, the prestige of your undergrad will not matter that much at all.   Second, if you're closer to the law school's average GPA and/or LSAT, your school's prestige *can* matter but only if it is very impressive and you lack other experiential or prestige factors to push you over the edge.  Finally, if you are in that last stage, school can play a role but it will be considered along with every other factor.\n\nAt its core, you have to ask yourself...\n\n* Am I more likely to perform academically better at a school?  Because GPA plays such a huge role in the first rounds, one of the most important things you can do for law school is to find the school where you can perform the best.  A high GPA and a high LSAT is a winning combination--regardless of undergrad school--for all but a few law schools (Berkley for example being a notable exception).  HOWEVER, this is ***NOT*** correlated with the \"quality\" of the undergrad or its prestige.  A lower ranked school does not mean easier As (generally).  You need to think about the environment, location, support system, class requirements, teacher quality, class size, and more to assess how well you will do at a given school.  Your ability to get a high GPA will be affected more by your own ability to succeed at a school than by the school itself if that makes sense.  This determination needs to be made more about where you will feel comfortable and at home.\n* Is the difference in prestige large such that a school would see a large difference between two applicants from these two schools?  Generally, the answer to that is going to be no or a very small yes.  If you were asking about Georgetown vs. AU it might start being really significant but generally, the gap between undergrad schools you get accepted to is not going to be huge if you targeted schools correctly.\n* What school provides the best opportunities to do cool things, make connections, or gain applicable experience?  God forbid the LSAT goes less than ideally or your GPA isn't as pristine as you would like (pssst hint: unless you are without a life it will never be perfect and you shouldn't want it to be...) the best thing you can do for your application is to make your resume have plenty of \"hooks\".  Hooks are gained through experiences, not in the classroom.  If being at a school will give you more opportunities to get out and explore new things and gain unique experiences, that school is likely more valuable to you than another, similar undergrad.  However, these will always be something you have to go out and get.  A school that provides you opportunities is one that is in the right location or have the right connections.  It does not mean they will hand it to you on a platter.\n\nOk...so let's finally talk about AU.  AU is obviously not the most prestigious undergrad.  It's also not looked down upon either so that is good.  SPA (the poli sci school) is of good quality in that field which (generally) means quality professors, a good curriculum, and well thought of by employers in the area.  Where AU can really shine is in its location and connections.  My time at AU was very fruitful for me professionally and personally because I was able to really leverage the value AU provided me.  As someone else in this thread said, AU really is what you make of it both professionally and personally.  You can get great internships at AU due to being in DC.  Many of the people who attend are intelligent but not unfriendly.  The social scene, while not a party school is fairly thriving meaning that you can develop as a person (which is surprisingly important to law school).  However, it is not necessarily for everyone.  You need to assess what fits best for you.  In 90% of cases, fit is the most important thing.\n\nI know this is long but if you have any questions feel free to DM me.  I'm more than happy to give my honest read and opinion on AU, your goals, and what I think is best for you.",

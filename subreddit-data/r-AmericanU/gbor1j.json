    "postText": "I was recently admitted to grad school at AU, and I'm planning to live near campus. I'd like an apartment within walking distance or a few metro stops. I've researched some of the complexes on Connecticut and Massachusetts Avenue, but I'd benefit from hearing from people with experience in the area. Are there any especially good ones, or ones I should steer clear of? I'm thinking of places like Berkshire House and Idaho Terrace.\n\nI don't have any special needs for an apartment - just A/C, quiet, non-smoking, reasonable landlord, and decently comfortable.",

The red takes you to the Tenley Town stop and then there's a shuttle that everyone takes from there to campus. I live on Connecticut and I'm pretty happy with the commute",

It\u2019s much nicer than the Berks, the hallways do occasionally smell like weed but it isn\u2019t constant by any means (plus every apartment has a decent sized balcony) and right next to the metro stop there is a grocery store, a CVS, and a Starbucks, along with various other restaurants and stores. My only real complaint is that since the pandemic started the leasing office has been a bit difficult and I do think it is a bit overpriced for what it is but I do also live in a 2Br.",

Last I heard, the decision to go in-person won't be final until the semester begins, so I have to choose between getting an apartment I may not need and leaving myself little time to get one if they do go in-person at the last minute. I'll just have to play it by ear.\n\nAny questions I should be sure to ask prospective landlords? I want to cover all my bases, since I likely won't be able to tour apartments in person.",

                    "comment": "Other than the normal like building amenity stuff, I would ask what some things to do in the neighborhood would be and what the transit options are like. DC\u2019s bus system is surprisingly good if unreliable time wise, and when the metro is working properly it\u2019s great.\n\nI currently live in the Van Ness neighborhood which as I said in my other comment, is one metro stop away from Tenley. If you\u2019re simply looking for somewhere with the bare necessities, then it\u2019s great. But there\u2019s not really much to do, if I want to go to a non wine bar I need to walk down to the next neighborhood, and if I want a variety of bars I need to go elsewhere in the city. The people here are on the whole either undergrad students or are older families. That was fine when I was an undergrad and a lot of my friends lived around here but since I graduated last May the majority of them have moved to Columbia Heights/Petworth/H Street area, and me and the last of the holdouts on this side of town are going to be moving to those areas at the end of this month. It\u2019s a lot of 20-somethings with a bunch of stuff to do. But to be fair, we also don\u2019t have to really worry about going to AU for anything, though I know of a lot of AU grad students who do live around there. \n\nIf you have any other questions I\u2019d be happy to answer.\n\n(Also you posted this comment 4 times btw)",

Gonna echo many of the comments here in recommending something a few stops off the Red Line - I live at Grosvenor-Strathmore (4 stops/10 min from Tenleytown-AU) and I have a much larger and much, much nicer 2 bed/2 bath place (w/roommates ofc, would\u2019ve been same in DC) than what I\u2019d get for this price at the Berkshire, Avalon at Foxhall, Frequency, Greenbriar, Macomb Gardens, etc. My girlfriend used to live in The Metropolitan in Bethesda and that was even nicer and more convenient, albeit a tiny bit pricier.\n\nIf the AU-area apartments are already in your price range, then head for the Maryland suburbs instead. You will have a much higher quality of life and probably save a few bucks too. Am happy to talk more if you want to PM me.",

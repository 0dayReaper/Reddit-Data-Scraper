    "postText": "Hey everyone! I just officially committed to AU, and I'm super excited to start in the fall. I was wondering if anyone can tell me what AU students like to do off campus for fun? The tour guide emphasized a lot of museums and monuments and while I'm super excited to take advantage of these things I'd also like some more options. I'm talking places to eat, activities, my tour guide even mentioned pop up concerts, anything you guys like to do for fun. Thank you so much!",

The Capitol Bikeshare has a deal with AU that gives students a massive discount ($30/year?) and I put that shizznit to work. Biking down to Georgetown and then around the national mall has given me a lot of therapy lol.\n\nAlso museums. Go to some random ones. Go to some mainstream ones. And then go to them again. I\u2019ve memorized my route around Air and Space.\n\nPlenty of clubs around AU. Join a couple of those. Maybe a club sport (shout out esports).",

            "comment": "Financial aid is notoriously horrible to reach at AU. My summer before getting to AU was spent trying to reach FA because they messed up my aid (telling me this July after I had already accepted my FA package etc) and wondering if I\u2019d still be able to go. \n\nThis past year, I had a $2000 scholarship in complete limbo because FA wouldn\u2019t respond to me, wouldn\u2019t pick up their phones, etc. I had one FA counselor tell a friend that she usually doesn\u2019t respond to emails or answer her phone; when he went in to talk, she told him he was being aggressive and pushy. \n\nI\u2019m attending AU because first of all, I love the school, but second, it\u2019s the only place I could afford. When they withhold FA info and won\u2019t respond to me, my ability to go to AU is in limbo. It feels like they don\u2019t care about my financial situation.\n\nThe only way I\u2019ve gotten results from FA is by marching into the office and asking to speak with someone about my situation. I\u2019ve had great results by going in and waiting for someone to assist me, and it seems to be the only way to get them to do anything.",

They really should be looking out for you way in advance rather than after all things happened and you are left with rather dramatic financial consequences.  They too made me wonder whether or not I can actually go to school with the way they handle money. I felt like I am begging them to do anything for me, which makes no sense.\n\n",

    "postText": "Hi all, I'm an incoming sophomore in my undergrad and currently considering transferring to AU for Spring 22. I'm currently a student at the University of Richmond, and there are a lot of reasons I'm considering transferring. Most importantly, I really hate the culture at Richmond. I was excited to go to a rigorous liberal arts school, but now that I'm actually there, I realize that many of the undergrad students are rich, privileged, and insensitive to the struggles of marginalized students and general social issues. I'm really passionate about social justice and hope to do some activism work during undergrad and beyond, so this has been really discouraging for me. \n\nBasically, I'm just looking for current students' opinions about the culture at AU. I've heard a lot about it generally being a pretty liberal school, and I'm hoping this might mean that there are a lot of students who share my passion for social justice and are more sensitive toward humanitarian issues. I'm looking for a school with a much more accepting atmosphere. The UR campus is also Very small and Very suburban (in the middle of the woods and you need a car to get anywhere off campus,) and that's made things very boring for me, so I'm also curious about the AU campus. \n\nAlso, my current plan is to double major in Philosophy and Political Science with a minor in French, so if anyone from any of those departments has anything to say, please share. Thank you!",

            "comment": "people are certainly very liberal, but like any private university there\u2019s a ton of rich kids who don\u2019t even necessarily realize the kind of relative wealth they come from. We gotta keep in mind that academia is extremely inaccessible for the vast majority of marginalized students, and the populations of students at any private school are going to lean wealthier. \n\nI\u2019m only able to afford to go to this school cause they give me 90%+ aid, and the people I\u2019ve met so far have lived very very different lives than me.\n\nAU is also pretty white. They try to hide this by being like \u201cwe have lots of international students!\u201d Who are\u2026 also white. And on the topic of wealth in my experience these international students tend to come from pretty wealthy families themselves too.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a good liberal school, AU is nice. If you\u2019re looking for a good liberal school filled with people who know their place, I\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t think that exists quite yet.\n\nMy 2c",

            "comment": "1: Lotta AU ppl are rich and stuck up, you won\u2019t find any differences in that regard, although certainly more liberal.\n\n2: Huge misconception that AU is in DC. I mean it is, but not downtown. Still very suburban. While you don\u2019t NEED a car to get downtown, it\u2019s an absolute pain in the ass without one. You gotta wait for the AU shuttle (which is notorious for being slow), then take a metro abt 5-8 stops depending on where you\u2019re going. The actual neighborhood surrounding AU has absolutely nothing. Literally. Once the on campus restaurants close for example, the closest place is a mile away in Tenleytown.\n\n3: be ready for a heavy course load. Philosophy and polisci are both heavy majors. You\u2019ll be doing lots of writing.",

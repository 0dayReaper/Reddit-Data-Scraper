            "comment": "One: Figure out how you're going to get to school. There's no parking for 1Ls in the garage underneath WCL, and if you park in the neighborhood around WCL, you will almost certainly get a $75 ticket from the school. If you need/want to drive to school, you have to park on main campus (paying the bucks for a parking pass) and take the free shuttle to school. Doable, but annoying. The free shuttles also go to the Tenleytown metro, so, that's a strong option.\n\nTwo: Some people take law school way too seriously. If you have no free time to spend with a significant other, never go out with friends, spend all your time in the library writing an outline the size of War and Peace, etc., you're trying too hard.\n\nThree: Some people don't take law school seriously enough. If you're out at the bars every night and aren't doing the reading, etc., you're not trying hard enough. Grades do matter, especially in the less than great legal market.\n\nFour: This doesn't apply to 1Ls, since you don't get choices, but when you get to pick classes your 2L and 3L years, DON'T pick classes based on the bar. What you need to know for the bar, you'll pick up in bar prep courses. \n\nDO pick classes based on professors. Professors make or break classes. Doesn't matter how exciting or dull a subject is. A good professor will make it amazing, a bad professor will make you wish you decided to become a sanitation worker instead of going to law school.\n\nI suggest you take Evidence, because it's so fundamental to what lawyers do. Similarly, I strongly urge you to take Administrative Law. It touches upon almost every other area of law, so, it's really important to know. If you can, take Professor Popper's class. His exam is long but fair, and he is a wonderful professor.\n\nFive: Do a clinic. Practical experience is vital, and it gives you the chance to learn and make mistakes in a safe environment with experienced practitioners guiding you and protecting you from harming your client or yourself.\n\nSix: Network, network, network. Your internships and externships, be it during the summer or during the academic terms, are vital for getting jobs after graduation. Networking will help you get good internships and externships, and they'll help you get jobs.\n\nSeven: Don't bother getting involved with the SBA. It's the equivalent of a high school student council but with even less real impact on the school and with more threats of lawsuits over silly things that don't matter a damn.\n\nEight: Do try for law review, and you don't get chosen for the main law review, join one of the briefs.\n\nNine: Go to office hours. Make sure professors know you and you know them, so when you need help getting an internship or job, etc., professors will a: have nice things to say about you, and b: want to help you.",

I have a friend majoring in physics so that he can work in policy relating to science. I know a lot of public health majors who will have a strong background in medicine and biology, but their main focus will be policy and work in the public sector relating to medicine.\n\nIf you're interested in politics and want to combine that with a love for CS or some science, I think AU is a fantastic school for that. It would be a great path to go down because it's something different than being a standard political science major. I've heard good things about the CS program regardless (it is small, and that could be a very good thing) and I think even if you don't plan to utilize the political activity around you at AU, it would be a good choice.\n\nI wish you a lot of luck and I can tell you my first few months on campus have been incredible. The clubs, classes, and professors are all great and I highly encourage you to look into applying.",

It's not a top school for cs, so if you want a really good education go elsewhere. But for us AU had other qualities that make it the right fit. I appreciate the SIS and the diversity it brings more than getting the absolute top education as being self motivated will get you farther in that regard. ",

AU is trying to catch up with STEM since they're known for international service, and it's really starting to show. I think a lot of CS majors at AU end up at really prestigious companies since there is a lack of engineers in DC especially. Definitely check it out or even minor in it. ",

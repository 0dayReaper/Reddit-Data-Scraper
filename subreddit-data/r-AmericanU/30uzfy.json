What do most students do in their free time?\n\n3. Are the dorms really as bad as everyone makes them out to be?\n\n4. Is there still a ModelUN club active on campus?  It appears to have closed last year.\n\nThanks!",

Tons of random shit going on campus too.\n2. Fuck if I know. There is all kinds of things, from intramural sports to debate team. If an AU student doesn't have anything to do, its their own fault.\n3. The only low quality rez hall is Anderson, but its being renovated for next year. The rest are really nice, in my opinion.\n4. Yeah there is, and it is very active. I tried to get in, but there were too many people. They take members based on an audition thing.",

            "comment": "1. Unless you want to do Greek Life, AU isnt really a big party school. However if you can get a fake, you can go downtown and party. Otherwise theres lots going on in the City.\n2. There is no average answer, but DC is a super fun city with almost anything you can think of so there is usually no shortage of activities.\n3. Yes, the dorms are not optimal. But compared with what they used to be they are much better. After Freshman year you can go and have a suite though elsewhere on campus. Really anywhere you go though freshman dorms suck, so it doesnt really matter.\n4. They aren't super active, I am a senior in SIS and never really heard of them doing anything. But there are better things than MUN at AU if you are into that since you are in DC.\n\nIf you have any other questions feel free to ask! ",

            "comment": "AU isn't a commuter school, but it is in a vibrant city.\n\nThat means that there is always something going on on campus because of all the students living there, looking for things to do. That can be parties or the many clubs.\n\nBut, that also means a lot of things happen off campus. Many upperclassmen move out of the dorms. Many people from the Model UN crowd just get internships at the US Capitol instead.\n\nSo, there's a party scene, many student clubs, and acceptable dorms. But there's also a big bar scene, the other type of clubs, and apartment buildings.",

            "comment": "1. Go greek or go home (in most cases, if you want to party).  If you do end up greek, there will be no end of drinking and drugs -- if that's what you're into.  Alternatively the sports teams and some academic fraternities have good social scenes too.*\n2. Drink, a lot.  Along with intern, work, etc.  Very much work hard play harder mentality.*\n3. No. \n4. Yes, but it's not very good.  I was Sec Gen of my MUN region in high school and was planning on doing MUN at AU but then as a freshman decided I'd rather do 'real' things like intern or work as opposed to MUN.  I think that's what a lot of people end up doing but MUN is a great step into the real world.  \n\n*These are purely based off my experience.  If that's not what you're into though there's totally a place for everyone though.  That being said, you're asking about UCSB so I'm assuming you're into the drinking scene...  Feel free to PM me if you have questions.",

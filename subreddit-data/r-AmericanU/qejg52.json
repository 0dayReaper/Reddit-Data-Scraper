    "postText": "I'm interested in a foreign policy career and the School of International Service would be my top choice in DC. I'm graduating in December, thinking about applying for Fall of 2022. Is it realistic to get in with a 3.4 GPA in undergrad (GMU, International Relations concentration) with a major GPA of 3.83? I struggled a LOT in classes outside my major but do have good work experience (interned with the State Department, etc.). My instinct is that if I were to wait a few years to apply until after I got some work experience that'd be a good idea but I also if possible would like to start as a part-time student in the Fall of 2022. Is it worth applying? Do you have any advice (should I apply now, wait later, any application advice?)",

Coming directly from undergrad, GPA matters more because they don't have as much else to look at (unless you have impressive internships, maybe).",

To me it seems that they care much more about how well you'll do rather than focusing on GPA (especially if a bad GPA is from old or irrelevant courses). Considering a 3.4 is solid and you have experience at State I'd say you're in good shape!",

    "postText": "Are lofts adjustable? Some of the pictures show the loft beds a bit lower, and the others show it all the way up. I would really like the extra space for a storage ottoman and a TV but the no railing thing is making me hesitate. I know I could just buy railings that go under the mattress but idk. I would appreciate any advice/info!",

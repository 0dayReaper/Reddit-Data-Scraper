I think once it gets up to 300$ in tickets they will boot you, since you arent paying it.  they will also freeze your class transactions and other stuff till you pay it.  If they boot you they will also offer to loan you cab fare home and add that onto the ticket price you owe.",

They don\u2019t know the car is yours until you go to pay the ticket\n\nAlso dont have an AU sticker or leave any stuff in the car that makes it obvious you\u2019re a student. Those idiots have nothing better to do with their time than patrol 45th street and guess which cars are students",

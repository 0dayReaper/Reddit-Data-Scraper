I applied ED2, but fear I\u2019ll be rejected. \ud83d\udc94\n\nmy stats:\n\nSAT: 1220\n\nGPA: 4.2\n\nEC\u2019s: Founder and president of many clubs, member of NHS, SNHS, and Tri-M, board member on a local arts council, service, academic teams, etc. \n\nRANK: top 10% \n\nMAJOR: Polisci\n\nI also come from an area where no one else applied and no one has since 2017... It\u2019s high in poverty, and I\u2019m first gen. \n\nalso if they didn\u2019t get my CSS profile by the deadline, will i just not be eligible for need-based aid?",

    "postText": "I transferred this semester to AU from a community college.\n\nI am still trying to understand the students here. It seems predominantly women, and though I know not every man here can be gay (and there is nothing wrong with that) every man acts like he is. I just want to give my peers a chance, but so far I have had a lot of trouble relating. I am not from the North East, and my parents are divorced / never went to college. For all the talk that AU had about diversity and first generation, it seems like the exact opposite folks gravitate here. I feel duped!\n\nI know this might sound like a complaint, but while I am candidly airing out my frustrations, I really want to know what I can do better to feel like I belong. Are my observations too wack?\n\nWhat advice do you have for me about the student body?",

            "comment": "Transferring is hard socially (as a fellow transfer student, I can really relate). Here's some tips: \n\nColleges are never homogenous. There will always be a niche that you fit in to. It will take a while to find it, but if you follow your interests, you'll get there. \n\nThere's a first gen college student club on campus, reach out to them! They're having an event either this week or next, you can find people who share your experience there. \n\n\"I know not every man here can be gay (and there is nothing wrong with that) every man acts like he is\" makes it sound like you don't want to relate to or associate with gay people. If that isn't what you meant, try to watch your phrasing. If it *is* what you meant, don't broadcast that. This is a very left leaning campus and it'll be harder for you to meet people with that kind of perspective.\n\nAlong the same lines: \"it seems predominantly women\" - what's wrong with that? The campus is predominantly female (About a 60-40 split without accounting for trans or GNC people). Talk to them, become friends with them. There's no reason for a predominantly female population would stop you from having friends.\n\nThere are tons of special interest clubs on campus too. Look on Engage for clubs that are active that you might be interested in. If you're still not finding people there, try the discord hub! There are lots and lots of small groups here. \n\nIt's going to take time, and it's going to take adjustments. My first year here was pretty lonely even with me actively trying to find friends. But yeah, those are my thoughts. Hope they help.",

I would say try looking for clubs and you will probably find people more like yourself or at least find environments where you can learn more about people and relate to them that you can't tell on first impressions",

And if it isn't an issue as you say it is, why bring it up in the first place? Do you not want to be friends with someone who might be gay?\n\nSaying you're not from the Northeast just kinda sounds like you're making a generalization about people from that region (of which the entire students body isn't from the northeast) as well rather than just the specific places you've been frequenting. \n\nWhere have you been going and what have you been doing that you've been getting this impression?",

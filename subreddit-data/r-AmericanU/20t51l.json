    "postText": "Hey eagles!\n\nI wanted to let everyone know about a collegiate Hearthstone LAN tournament we at One Nation of Gamers and Red Bull are holding at Rumors this Saturday from 12:30 PM to 5:30 PM. There will be players from various competitive gaming student groups participating, and it would be great if we could get some spectators to cheer them on!\n\nOne thing in particular I want to stress is that you do not have to have any experience (or even interest for that matter) in Hearthstone to have a good time; Rumors is a great place and will be open as usual, so you are more than welcome to just come hang out, maybe have a drink and grab a bite to eat!\n\nThere's more info on the Facebook event, including registration! (Slots still open as of posting!) https://www.facebook.com/events/1392752037660073/?ref_dashboard_filter=upcoming\n\nAnd here is the location: http://www.rumorsrestaurant.com/\n\nHope to see people there!\n\n-Kyle",

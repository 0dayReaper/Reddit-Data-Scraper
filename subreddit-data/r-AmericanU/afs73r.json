    "postText": "Hey, so I applied ED 2 and was kind of curious to get more insight on the location of AU. So I have a few questions for any current students. \n\nHow long exactly does it take you to get to downtown DC? \n\nHow often do you/students in general go into downtown? \n\nHow long of a walk is it to the metro? Is it easy to get a bus to the metro stop (any clue how often they run?)\n\nDo any students have off campus housing in the more central area of DC?",

            "comment": "2013 alum here who stayed in the district until last year, but most of the answers are gonna be about the same.\n\nDepends on what you mean by \"downtown\". Dupont (where a lot of students go on weekends) is 10 minutes, Metro Center is about 15, Chinatown is about 17, Federal Triangle is about 20, Eastern Market and L'enfant are about 30. Assuming no long waits or delays of course. Transfers to other lines obviously add time.\n\nDepends on the student. I went once a week maybe. Some people never did. Some went every day. Some did on the weekends. \n\nHardly anyone walks to the metro but it's about a 15 minute walk from north campus so it's not bad. There's a free shuttle that takes you to the stop. It's maybe 5 minutes on the shuttle from north side depending on how many stops the driver has to make, what time of day, what day of the week, etc. The shuttles run pretty frequently but late at night they run less frequently. I never waited more than 10-15 minutes for a bus even then. There's an app, I think, that shows where they are.\n\nStudents live all over. A majority live in the Tenleytown area and adjacent neighborhoods. Some live farther out. Some commute from NoVA or PG/MoCo.",

    "postText": "Hi! \nSo when I was a senior is high school I completely fell in love with AU after attending one of the special event day. However with the onset of the pandemic, attending a 4-year university wasn\u2019t economically feasible for me. Instead, I attended my local cc and I\u2019m getting my associates next month!\n\nI applied this academic cycle for the spring and got accepted !! While my admissions officer warned of the lack of financial aid, my package was still a total blow. To fund just the spring I would have to take out subsidized and unsubsidized loans alongside personal loans. Do y\u2019all think such a financial leap is worth it?? I was thinking about this on top of all the social aspects of spring transferring. \n\nBut my issue is waiting for the fall is I\u2019ve already completed the maximum transferable credits. So should I transfer into the spring semester??",

Financial aid was not my friend for this spring and so I am transferring in with a personal loan from my uncle (thankfully) as my stepmom/dad refused to  help pay.  \n\n\nI would say if it is something you can take on and are comfortable enough financially in the future, do it! In addition, emphasize your use of federal loans (Parent PLUS loan if possible) before you use private/personal loans. Also look for starting salaries for your major and see if it is feasible taking on a large amount of debt",

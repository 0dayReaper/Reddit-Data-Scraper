This feels super surreal because I want to attend AU but there is zero way I\u2019m going $120k further into debt for a 2 year degree. Absolutely bonkers.\n\nMeanwhile I got an offer from another good program which costs the same, but they gave me a merit scholarship that pays for 60% of the cost. There\u2019s no away AU can come close to matching this.",

I\u2019m not expecting to receive any merit awards, but I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re still processing more awards outside of the loan offers. \n\nWhen I e-mailed them they just sent an automated response.",

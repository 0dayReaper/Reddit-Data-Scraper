A lot if not most classes will be online anyway, social events will be pretty much nonexistent, and it just won\u2019t be the real experience. By staying home, I can avoid having to take out any loans for my entire freshman year since I\u2019m saving on room and board. Not to mention the pandemic is spiking and the\n\u201cpresident\u201d isn\u2019t exactly doing much about it so I\u2019m not expecting the situation to get better. Might as well stay home and have a little more freedom.",

I did consider it briefly, since AU wasn\u2019t my first choice anyway, but decided against it. I\u2019m also not living in the US right now, (I am a citizen though) and it seemed like an unnecessary complication.",

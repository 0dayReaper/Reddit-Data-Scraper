I took the SATs right when they switched from 1600 to 2400, and I think I got a 1600 because my parents used to joke about me getting a perfect score. \n\nI went to a private Quaker school and the grading system wasn\u2019t standard. I\u2019m also not sure what an EC is. \n\nMy community college GPA was a 3.7 though. ",

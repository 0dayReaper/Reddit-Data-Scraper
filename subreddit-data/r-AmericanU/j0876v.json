You don't have to answer all of the questions. Thanks\n\nHow was your freshman experience\n\nWhy did you decide to go to AU, was their something unique their that you couldn't find somewhere else\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about this college? Least favorite?\n\nHow would describe the school environment\n\nIs the campus safe\n\n\u00a0Is it easy to get to town and/or home?\n\nWhat support services are available (academic advisers, tutors, etc.)?\n\nIs there anything you learned about the school only after you started classes that you wish you would have known before committing?\n\nHow is the dorm system, and the food",

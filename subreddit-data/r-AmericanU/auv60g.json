Visited American over the summer and loved the whole feel of the school but never  spent a huge amount of time at DC so I just want to know if anyone knows what life is like for a grad student and bar scene is like.

Good faculty, good community, and proximity to all the politicking in the city. The bar scene directly around AU is limited, but DC has plenty of bars. The Washington DC subreddit has regular happy hour meetups too if you were looking for a regular group",

A studio is less, but space is small as you can imagine. Depending on your experience, though, you could get the right job that will cover what you need. The DC job market is strong",

That plus the quant degree sounds like a winning combination for this area. You could work government, a government contractor, etc.",

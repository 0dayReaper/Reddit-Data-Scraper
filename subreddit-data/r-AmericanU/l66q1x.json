I had very similar credentials (4.5 gpa, 9 APs, 5 honors,  academic/competitive club background, plus community service) so I think I can give you some sound advice :))))))\n\nI think you'll get in fine! I applied for regular acceptance and got in no issue, and AU was my top choice. I think it also helped that I did the video interview (not sure if they're doing that again this year, but they did them in 2019). I was also super anxious about getting in and tried to cover all my bases.",

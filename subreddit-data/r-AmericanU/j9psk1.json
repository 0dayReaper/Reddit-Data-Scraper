Biology tends to be full of premed students, which can be a bit frustrating for those not interested in medicine, but all of our science programs are top notch. Lots of our professors here conduct research with local labs (NIST, NASA, NIH, NRL, etc), and lots of students get to do work with those professors or in other local capacities. \n\nAU is a liberal arts school, and liberal arts schools are, for my money, the best place to get a STEM degree.",

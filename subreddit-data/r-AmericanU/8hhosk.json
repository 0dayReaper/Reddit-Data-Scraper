    "postText": "Hey everyone! I recently started (like literally today) a Meetup group for Asian-Americans, people of color and anyone interested in telling their stories or stories about their communities through film. Open to all filmmakers, screenwriters, actors, creative people of all backgrounds + experience/skill levels! Reaching out to students, professionals, whoever in the area so thought some of you might be interested! If anyone has any suggestions for the group, feel free to let me know!\n\nhttps://www.meetup.com/Asian-American-DMV-Filmmakers/",

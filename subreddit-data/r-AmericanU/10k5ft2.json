I was in SPA and the canvas page for undergrad advising had a description of who to reach out to for each school if you needed them.\n\nIf you can't find this, send an email to your advisor, and they'll definitely know the process for getting them. It's a quite common request as people need them for transferring, applying to grad school, study abroad, etc.",

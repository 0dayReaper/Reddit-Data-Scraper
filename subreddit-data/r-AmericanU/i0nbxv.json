Especially for a University of AU\u2019s size while comparatively the plans of larger universities were less thorough. \n\nIt seems pretty clear from their letter the main reason it changed to online only stems from the unrealistic restrictions Bowser placed on  universities to keep track of incoming students so close to the start of classes. \n\nNot looking forward to taking language classes online only but it is what it is....",

Trying to do a lecture or seminar while wearing a mask and having maybe half or a third of the class present while the rest are watching online (with some way for them to ask questions) was doomed to failure.\n\nWhat I'm disappointed about is not being able to have small group sessions on campus outside of the regular class times.",

The revenue hit from this to AU is going to be immense. Not to mention the uncertainty created from this change so close to the Fall in terms of job security. Plus the students who have already signed leases off campus. Just terrible timing....",

It sounds like the hangup is that they're not sure what the District will allow.\n\nIt's pretty clear that the District pulled the plug on the previous plans that had been tentatively approved \u2013 GWU, Georgetown, and AU all announced online-only within like 3 days of each other, after previously having hybrid plans, and I don't think it was done willingly. But it's not clear how far that goes. Can local students come on campus to use the wifi and empty classrooms as study rooms? The admin thinks at least the library and its study rooms are going to be allowed to be open. Could a small group of students use a room to join an online course (put it up on the projector, etc.)? Not clear at all.",

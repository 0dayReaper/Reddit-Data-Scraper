I\u2019m mainly worried about the diversity at American because I\u2019ve attended P.W.Is most of my life, and have never really enjoyed it (being Asian myself). So how is the diversity and inclusion at American?",

Add in the very diverse faculty and staff you\u2019ll encounter, and I believe you will find AU to mirror DC well in terms of diversity.",

But it definitely seems like there is a lot of diversity there. If anyone is at a graduate level right now, maybe you can shed some light here.",

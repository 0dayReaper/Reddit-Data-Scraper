    "postText": "Hi. I am a incoming sophomore and I was on the waitlist for housing and I got a room in frequency but I was going to get a apartment in the Berkshire. Both are similar in price so I was wondering which one would be better and why. Bershire is closer buy frequency is through AU. Which one is nicer and which is more socially active (I hear the Berkshire has a lot of AU students so I was specifically wondering if frequency is socially active).  \n\n\nThanks",

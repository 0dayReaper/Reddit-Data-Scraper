    "postText": "So I have been waiting on this package for 3 days in the mail that has a some essential stuff that I forgot to bring with me. It arrived yesterday but outside of the hours of operation for the package room in Anderson/Centennial Hall, ok that's fine I'll pick it up tomorrow. Now I went down at 10:00 Am the next day when I was informed it opened and it was closed. I asked the front desk and they said it opens \"around 10\". Now it's 11:00 Am and I checked again and it's still closed, I asked again and they said they don't know who is supposed to be working it. Usually I am pretty chill about this stuff but how can they be so careless about people's mail? It's just so frustrating because it's come all this way just to be bottlenecked at the end of the line, 20 ft away from me but it might as well have not been shipped in the first place. Anyways now that I have vented about that, is there anything I can do to solve this problem or do I just have to wait until the package Room eventually opens. \n\nUpdate- After giving up and doing other stuff I checked in around 3 and they were open so I was finally able to pick up my package. Too bad I have another package coming in 2 days so I will most likely have to go through this ordeal all over again. ",

That will also give them more of an idea of when they are open and hopefully allow you with more information.\n\nYou should also email housing@american.edu with this if they were truly supposed to be open at 10am but weren't. It's important for them to know when people are skipping shifts",

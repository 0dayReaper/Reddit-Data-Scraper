    "postText": "Hey everyone, I'll be attending AU this year for a post bacc program and I live in Alexandria so I was going to get a parking pass to drive to school, back from the library when I'm done for the day, or to work. I wanted to ask if anyone had any experience with getting their permit payment refunded when things went virtual since at my undergrad school it took a lot of backlash by the students until the school finally agreed to refund a portion of the payment for the remaining school year. I'm just worried with covid on the rise again and wasn't sure if I should pay for the full year or just pay for a semester now and risk permits being sold out for the next semester. Or is that not really an issue at AU (at my undergrad it was a lottery system for parking permits and an absolute shit show). Also wanted to ask about parking in general, like  is it usually hard to find a spot?  Thank you for any advice!",

AU is one of my top college choices. i am trying to finalize my schedule for this upcoming school year, and i don't know if i should take AP Language and Composition or just take regular english. i've heard a lot of people say that AP classes are a waste of time/a scam, butttt i wanted to get input from people who actually go there \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95",

            "comment": "AP classes are not a scam! I took 9 in high school and passed the tests which were really beneficial in college. I basically was able to skip all the basic, required college courses. I also came in with a significant amount of credits which allowed me to register earlier than students with less credits (pretty much guaranteeing me the classes I wanted at the time I wanted). And lastly it saved me a full year of AU tuition, which is huge. If you have the chance to utilize your free high school education to save you thousands and better set you up for success, I wholeheartedly recommend taking AP classes when you can.",

            "comment": "Just to balance what everyone is saying: AP classes are a good way to get some basic credits out of the way and not worry about some requirements when you get into college, so you have more academic flexibility and/or can graduate early. They are also a good way to learn more advanced things than the non-AP version, if you\u2019re just dying to learn\u2014though some amount of it *is* teaching to a test; I\u2019d be curious to know if there are studies comparing the actual quality of education between AP courses and the college equivalents. \n\nI don\u2019t recommend taking APs if your sole intention is to boost your resume. They can help sometimes, but the impact might not be as strong as other factors, such as extracurriculars and expressed interest. I know people who got into Harvard taking zero APs, and I know people who got rejected from Harvard despite taking a dozen. I myself took only two (three if you include the summer program that supposedly was based on an AP class and did prompt me to take the exam, but was technically not part of my school\u2019s education in any way) and got accepted fine. From what I\u2019ve gathered, it\u2019s not the big influence people think it is.\n\nTake AP classes if you want the college credit, earlier education, or (maybe?) merit scholarship. Don\u2019t break your back to take a whole bunch of them just to be impressive, and make sure you have time to do other things during your school time, and generally just breathe and be healthy.",

Another small thing is that if you score a 4 or 5 on the AP Lang exam you can only take 1 semester of writing as a freshman rather than two.",

As long as you do all the work assigned in class (I never had homework for Lang) and pay attention, you'll do fine! In my opinion, it's one of the easiest APs - very little workload. The test may seem daunting (3 essays!) but if you practice all year, there's not much to be worried about.",

That free slot could to another gen ed (or whatever the hell they\u2019re  called now) or major requirement that you\u2019d probably enjoy more anyway.  I think I took 9 AP exams, passing 7, and I actually maxed out the credits AU let you transfer in from APs. Allowed to turn my double major into a dual degree.",

            "comment": "So i took both dual enrollment type classes and AP's, but not many. I took 4 credits worth of outside courses and 2 AP's. One of the AP's I took, i didn't get credit for because i didn't have a high enough score. My belief on this is to only take as much as you can handle. I personally think it's more important to perform well without pushing your limits to the point you're stressed. You need time to do things you enjoy, go join a few clubs. Extracurriculars are extremely valuable and colleges want to see you did things. I remember pretty well from an AU admissions counselor that they want to see you did other things besides being a student, and that you stuck to em. E.g. I was on the debate team all 4 years of high school, as well as participating in choir and acapella for 4 years.  It's important to just find what you enjoy, and if admissions counselors can see your passion/dedication/drive, that's most important, you need to stand out!",

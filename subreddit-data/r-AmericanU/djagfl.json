    "postText": "Hi friends!! So my senior year of high school, i visited and loved american, but decided to go to a liberal arts college instead because i was an undecided major and was thinking i might have some interest in STEM related things. This school sucks though, and i\u2019m also an international affairs major!! So my question is- would transferring spring semester be hard? Will it be easy to kind of fit in right away with clubs and stuff? Also, i\u2019ve heard that american is boring, is this true? What do you guys do on the weekends? I\u2019m totally down with going to the city a lot and just chilling with friends if thats what people mean by boring!! Thanks for the help!!",

Being small has its perks as it can actually attend individually to the students instead of treating students as statistics(no pun intended, coming from a state university). I work at the Don Myers tutoring lab and me and my colleagues always help students with math/stats too. The people I know in the program have interned at NIH, data trust, etc. I don\u2019t know where you got the AU stem program is bad idea from. Do not trust the program rankings. Also, realize this, just because the program is ranked well does not mean you\u2019re gonna be well. AU offers the same resources just as any other acclaimed schools do. \n\nBy the way, speaking of data science. One of the most famous cryptographer in the US Bruce Schneider graduated from AU. The book Da Vinci code was based on his area of work. Also, blackboard is an invention by an AU alum named Michael Chasen. \n\nJust my 2 cents.",

Being a political active school means there\u2019s always important people(Obama, Trudeau, John Kasich, condoleeza Rice) giving speeches at SIS. There are concerts given by interesting people(Hailey Kiyoko). Also, you\u2019re given a U-pass which allows you to explore the city of DC limitlessly. Use it well to catch some sports game(nationals, wizards. Capitals) or some DC annual events(cherry blossom festival), not to mention the museums(the African American museum was built by an AU alum).",

If you\u2019re interested at all in stem, specifically physics, they surprisingly have a kick ass physics department. The physics professors are so friendly and genuinely want to help you follow your interests to the point where they let you modify your degree requirements and let you do projects you\u2019re excited about. Wanted to put that out there in case means anything to you",

I have a friend who did a dual degree in IR and physics and employers were lining up to hire him. A lot of people have IR/political degrees, but it really really sets you apart if you have some STEM skills as well. Being able to get that sort of education is probably the best thing about AU. To be honest with you, I had a rough time because I definitely didn\u2019t fit in as a strictly STEM student. HOWEVER, I made a few really close friends and now I have a job I\u2019m crazy about. In terms of American being \u201cboring\u201d, it definitely is what you make of it. It can be boring, depending on what you\u2019re referring to specifically. Being in DC, even if you think AU is boring, there\u2019s a ton of opportunity the find things that are exciting outside of school.",

I actually am more interested in Math/Statistics, so there is a chance I will try to double major with that or at least minor, but not sure how that program is! Overall, did you like AU?",

    "postText": "Hi Y'all! \n\nAs stated I'm considering Transferring to AU! I'm currently a sophomore at CU Boulder and a IA major. While CU is wonderful I feel AU would be a much better fit for my degree and career prospects. The meat of this is that I would love to have your guy's opinion on AU, it's IA/IR program as well as the general social scene on campus! Much love from a mile high!",

There are some frat parties though but most of them are off campus. Other than that, it\u2019s pretty much political (feel the Bern, climate change etc), if ur not political(like me) u won\u2019t fit in. However, I think the small setting of class allows you to make friends easier than say a state school. I made a lot of friends here because I work for the math/stats department. If ur gung-ho on politics, protest, this is the place for you.",

I had fun at AU\u2014but largely because I made friends with social people who were out at DC bars (not house parties), mixed with GW/Gtown students and attended their parties, etc. I had a social network in and out of AU and it enhanced my experience and impression of AU. Again...everything is what you make of it.",

            "comment": "I actually transfered out of AU to CU Boulder. I disliked (and still do) AU with a passion. It isn't a place for everybody but if it fits you, it'll be good. I felt it isn't a place for me. Then again, I study media production and film. I felt I didn't fit in with the student body and didn't see eye to eye with them. I feel that AU is a very homogenous place. I like the diversity of a big school (I mean diversity as in interests, walks of life, idologies, etc) and I felt that AU couldn't offer that.\n\nI'd suggest reaching out to multiple people who attend the school and get a feel for it. Talk to people on why they like the school. Also talk to people who dislike the school but never left. Difference of opinion is valuable. \n\nI know people who still love the school. I know people who looked me in the eye and said \"you are lucky you transferred when you did. I feel that it's too late to leave.\" \n\nIn other words ...  do your research. People either love it or hate it. Feel free to ask my questions too.",

You can always go back for your Masters and a place like Georgetown U has good payback at the graduate level. You will meet recently graduates AU IR majors (ugrad and grad) literally working at local Starbucks, even the UPS store on campus. AU is physically more proximate to some IR orgs, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019ll get jobs there.",

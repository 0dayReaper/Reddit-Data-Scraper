    "postText": "Does anyone know if there are other ways to get financial aid at AU other then the max 7500 they give a transfer student per semester. Apparently the school should be giving way more financial aid then what they actually do give. I wonder if pressing the financial aid office about this issue would help at all. Or if they just suck and are going to doge as many financial aid for students as possible. Apparently there is an alum association and group of staff that \u201cfundraises for students in need\u201d but when my friend who was in financial need contacted them she was told that there was nothing they can help them with.",

After adding the $2,500 Pell Grant, $1,000 FWS, and $2,250 federal loan for each semester, I\u2019ll be paying around $10k-$12k a semester for tuition alone (not counting room and board which will probably toss another $6k-$7k [at least]). So I would also like an answer for this. Upvoting for visibility.",

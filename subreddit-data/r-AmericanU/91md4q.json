            "comment": "There's this odd obsession by a lot of students about themselves being \"wonks\" (studious, hardworking, problem-solving, etc.) -- without being much of actual wonks (*i.e.* a lot of people take themselves way too seriously here).  There are plenty of fraternity parties to attend if that's your thing, just as there is an abundance of academic-based activities, too; but it isn't a fraternity-centered campus, if that's what you're wondering.  Being based in D.C., you can pretty much find anything and everything to do.\n\nThe student body leans incredibly left politically, and you're going to find a very liberal culture here.  Socially it's fine like any other university.  Athletics are not stressed.  In fact, the students are very self-aware that this is not a strongly athletic school.\n\nIt has a little bit of everything with a premium focus on politics and hot-button topics of the day.  If you like to argue and discuss political issues -- albeit you'll be doing so in an incredibly tight ideological bubble for the most part -- then you'll have a fun time.",

Even if every future president was a AU grad, and assuming 4 year terms, they are gonna die before that happens. ",

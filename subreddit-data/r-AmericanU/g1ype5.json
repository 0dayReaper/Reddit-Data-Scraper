    "postText": "Hi guys, I just got admitted to AU off the waitlist. I also got admitted to GW Elliott. I used to lean heavily towards going to GW because Elliott is pretty good from what I've heard/read and because of the proximity to downtown DC, but now I'm unsure. I want to study international relations and I'd like to hear from you which school is better. \nThanks!",

The food is not great either. I would say that it is really average for a college; maybe slightly worse. Dorm parties are very common and there are some frat parties. It\u2019s not a party school at all, but there is definitely a lot of drinking/hooking up on weekends. I\u2019m majoring in poly sci.",

    "postText": "Although DC only has a few cases of coronavirus so far, there seems to be a lot of rumors going around about break being potentially extended or classes going completely online. Does anyone have any info or guesses about if this will happen? And if so what would it be like and what preparations should be taken before it happens? I\u2019ve heard that GW has told its professors to be ready to move their classes online and is considering this move if things continue to get worse.",

Doubt it is a big secret or anything, but expect a decision on Wednesday.\n\nIf I had to guess, they will take the time to disinfect all the buildings and dorms while students are away. That makes sense to me.",

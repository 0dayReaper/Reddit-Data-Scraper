I\u2019ll be studying abroad in the fall but my friend will be running it in the fall (I come back in the spring, we are trading places). My friend group here skates, I know probably 5+ people who skate on campus. Freedom plaza also isn\u2019t too far from campus if you bike or take the metro, Shaw skatepark is a longer metro ride but a fun park. Hopefully once our skateboarding club is official they\u2019ll give us funds for a rail or something",

    "postText": "I recently got accepted into SIS and AU is my top choice but even with the grant I was given, the total is insane. I\u2019m the first person in my family to attend college in the US so I genuinely have no knowledge on tuition and loans. Does the estimate mean my family needs to come up with that money in order for me to afford it or am I able to take out loans myself somehow? As much as I want to go for the opportunities, I also don\u2019t want to make a horrible financial decision for my family so any advice would be greatly appreciated!!",

I got most of my need meet with grants (federal and institutional) &amp; the rest of it with a small subsidized and work study which I could pay off with the money I earned at work this year. \n\nI ended up not committing though.",

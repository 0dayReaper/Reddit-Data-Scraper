Because of the expanding size of AU they actually prefer you to live off campus if possible. Also every college ever would give a local the ability to live off campus. \nWord of advice for living on campus go to as many extra curricular events to meet people as possible. Be present at welcome week and try to make friends! I\u2019m a senior so I hope you have as good of a time at AU as I have. And I hope you get to walk!",

But in most cases, you have to live on campus. But from your 2nd year and onwards, you're more than welcome to live off-campus wherever.",

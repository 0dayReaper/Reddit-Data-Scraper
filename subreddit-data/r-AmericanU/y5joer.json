    "postText": "I was considering applying for one of the MA in International Affairs degrees at the School of International Service. I was wondering what career paths this may lead to, considering that I'm an international student. From a cursory google, I could gather that many folks end up working for the State Department or other US government bodies: avenues that may not be open to foreigners.\n\nAny input is appreciated!",

SIS is an excelente school for international service, therefore, it\u2019s main purpose is to provide a path to top US government, foreign service (diplomats, USAid projects) or multilaterals (United Nations, World Bank, InterAmerican Development Bank, Organization of American states, International Monetary Fund, among others). This is a very popular program to those  who want to pursue politics in their home countries, thanks to the networking potential and connections with top US agencies. Finally, a lot of think tanks might also offer you a job, but the H visa is exclusive for think tanks, plus I heard WLB isn\u2019t really good for the low salaries. \n\nMulti-laterals, which have good pay and excellent WLB, will sponsor you with a G4 visa (diplomatic, no taxes) which may sound good but the reality depends on your objectives, mainly if you want to stay in the states and work in the private sector, or not. I have done consulting for OAS, IDB and World Bank and networking is a must, who you know is more important than your skill set (although you need to build some hard skills). Moreover, job stability might be an issue sometimes in these organizations or if you land a role that isn\u2019t relevant enough. The key is becoming a staff member of the organization. Basically they offer contracts up to 3 years top, once the contract is completed (if not renewed) you have 1 month to leave the country. Finally, if you land a job in this places, you will lose the opportunity to activate your OPT. That being mentioned, you can always land a job in multi-laterals with networking and hard skills (economics, finance, IT, analytics, accounting). \n\nFeel free to DM me if you want. \n\nIf your objective is to pursue a career within the private sector, this might not be the master for you. Same if you don\u2019t have work permit in the states.",

    "postText": "I'm a UK student applying to study for one year in the US in between the second and final year of my course over here in the UK. \nI've come to realise how much more difficult it is to find a list of offered degree programmes on an American uni website compared to a British one. One can usually be found eventually, but only after a certain amount of digging (compared to 1 or 2 clicks from the homepage of a British uni website). \nWhat courses any given university teaches is one of the most important things a potential applicant needs to know, so why isn't it put right out on front street instead of hidden away?

Good luck!",

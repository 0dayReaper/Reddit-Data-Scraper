You might consider the Red Line stops from Bethesda (if you\u2019re ok with living just over the border in Maryland) through Woodley Park, though the shops in by the Woodley Park and Cleveland Park stop are a bit less of a traditional grocery store, they are more markets (plus the small target grocery section) but real stores aren\u2019t too far away, still within walking distance. I\u2019d recommend getting one of those granny carts honestly, really increases your range. If you\u2019re open to the bus, that opens more areas too that might have cheaper rent, such as Cathedral Heights or Glover Park like the commenter below me mentioned, the former of which is absolutely walking distance from campus and technically walking distance from the metro but it is a bit of a hike, though a fast bus ride on a very frequent route.",

The two closest to AU are the Berkshires and the Avalon on Foxhall, but those may be out of your price range, but are just a few minute walk from campus. I had friends that lived at 4200 Cathedral, also quite close to campus. The issue with all these places is that none of them are all that close to the red line without using either the shuttle or a bus plus walking, though they\u2019re not too terribly far from a grocery store. The Van Ness neighborhood also has a large concentration of AU and other students. A few buildings to look at there might be the AVA Van Ness (I lived there as a student and loved it but apparently it has gone downhill after I left), 3003 Van Ness, Park Van Ness, Connecticut House, Avalon on Ablemarle, The Brandywine, or really any building on or just off Connecticut Avenue within a few blocks of the Van Ness, Cleveland Park, or Woodley Park metro stations.",

            "comment": "Hey, congratulations on your acceptance to AU!\n\nAU students who live near campus tend to live on Wisconsin Ave, Massachusetts Ave, or Connecticut Ave. I've met graduate students who live in Virginia for cheaper rents, but their commute is longer and metro access from VA to DC in the NW area of DC is a little limited. Others will live in Maryland towns with Red Line Metro access, like Bethesda or Rockville, in search of cheaper rents. In terms of common AU student apartment complexes, the Berkshire on Massachusetts Ave is probably dominated by AU students. \n\nIn my opinion, access to the Red Line will pay dividends in any future internships or social opportunities you will have. The Red Line leads to Metro Center, which can access any other line. Look for apartments along Connecticut Ave to maximize your access to intra-DC red line access. \n\nAlso, be aware that apartments in this area will increase your rent by at least $100 per month for the privilege of parking a car in their garage. I wouldn't try to park on public streets in NW DC because most streets have permit requirements, especially near AU, to allow local homeowners to park their cars on the street. Parking in this area without a permit will give you a part-time job of moving your car around every couple of hours.",

            "comment": "Hello. DC resident here who was just accepted to the MPP program. As said by others, American University is near the Tenleytown station on the red line. This area of DC is among the most expensive though, but there are other options. Where you choose to stay kind of depends on what feel you are looking for. Tenleytown offers a semi urban-suburban feel. For a more urban feel, I would go with Cleveland Park, Woodley Park, or Dupont circle. (These areas are very pricey though). You could also go further down the red line to Capitol Hill by Union Station, NoMa, or even the H street corridor. The opposite direction of the red line will take you up to Friendship Heights and Bethesda, which have a nice urban feel near the Metro stations. Further up the red line toward Twinbrook the rent will be cheaper, but it\u2019s more suburban and further from the city. Which IMO is a little boring and can be inconvenient when there is construction/single tracking on the red line. \n\nAnother option is to live in Glover Park near the 33 bus line. This bus comes every 10 minutes and goes directly to Tenleytown. There isn\u2019t much metro access in this area though. \n\nThe area also has pretty frequent bus service to Columbia Heights station via the H Series busses. Columbia Heights is very urban and very popular among young people, but it is still gentrifying so it can feel a little rough around the edges for someone not used to an urban environment. (Similar to the H street corridor). This area is generally the cheapest of the ones I mentioned though. \n\nI hope this helps.",

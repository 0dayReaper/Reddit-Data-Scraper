    "postText": "Hey all, I was recently accepted to American's WMP. I'm interested in  doing the 3-4+2 program in Engineering with Columbia ultimately. I really enjoy constitutional law. I don't know if this program is right for me.\n\nI want some kind of college social life. From what I've read, the program can take away from some of the social activities of college (new people, clubs, partying). I feel like jumping into the second semester, I may have missed out on a whole lot in the first semester. I also don't think that this program falls in line with what I want to study. \n\nCan someone who knows more about it or has participated in it please chime in? Thanks!",

I got accepted into WMP saying similar stuff, but realized that these were forum posts from years ago. Until relatively recently, WMP was hosted and housed off campus in Tenleytown (not sure where), making a social life harder. They've since moved that on campus, with students housing in Leonard Hall, which is right in the middle. I wound up not being in mentorship and I haven't talked to anyone who has done it, so I don't know what it's actually like, but my understanding is that it's a lot better than the past, and old posts can be misleading for this reason.

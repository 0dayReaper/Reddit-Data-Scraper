            "comment": "Glad to hear you\u2019re coming to AU! The campus, at least in my opinion is beautiful, it\u2019s a registered arboretum so plenty of trees, flowers, and general green all over the place. The campus is also nicely compact for most of the classes, sometime you\u2019ll get a place a bit far flung but usually even then it\u2019s a 10 minute walk at the most. All of the buildings are great to look at from the outside and most are good from the inside too. Hurst is a little rough but if I am not mistaken that\u2019s mostly a science building. I think it\u2019s definitely one of the better DC campuses.\n\nAs for the best food Tenleytown has just about everything you could want, Chick-fil-A, Whole Foods, Angelico\u2019s, and a bunch of great Chinese and Indian places. However there\u2019s also fantastic non-chain places like 2 Amy\u2019s which has the best pizza I\u2019ve ever had and I highly recommend going there. There\u2019s also chef geoffs, 5 guys, and steak and eggs. Plus you\u2019ll have your metro card so if you want to go out of your way to other places around the city it\u2019s really easy. \n\nIn terms of housing quality the freshman dorms kinda suck but I\u2019m sure that\u2019s the norm pretty much everywhere. Centennial is the best freshman dorm in my opinion because it has a suite style bathroom and you have suite mates so it\u2019s kinda like having 3 roommates that you only see when you seek them out. The sophomore and above housing is all fantastic though, most residence buildings have been newly renovated like east campus and what not. My personally favorite place to live is Nebraska hall but you gotta be a junior for that. The food quality isn\u2019t that great in the cafeteria. I personally like wonk burger a lot though but even that\u2019s hit or miss.\n\nIn terms of ROTC I think the program is run from Georgetown but I wouldn\u2019t know for sure. Also, Greek life isn\u2019t massive but it\u2019s noticeable. I had a bunch of people rush my freshman year, but again it\u2019s not huge or anything and I don\u2019t know much about the actual going\u2019s on there.",

            "comment": "I joined Honors freshman year during covid so for me personally, it was hard to meet and make friends in my cohort but I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s better since being back on campus lots of events to hang out, free day trips to NYC, ice skating etc. I would say for any major besides STEM based majors, Honors is a great program to learn research skills.\n\nFor me, I\u2019m a Computer Science major so the research done on campus for CS and Data Science is different than the research presented by Honors hence why I feel honors wasn\u2019t worth it for myself but I know for Polisci and International service it opens up amazing opportunities to research/work/study abroad. The classes I took freshmen year were really interesting - they really push for developing critical thinking and analysis skills, but in the end were irrelevant to my courses.\n\nOne of my biggest criticisms is the number of courses needed during freshman and sophomore year; I basically had/currently have no room for electives (there are courses that can overlap with courses within a major but because Honors is not STEM-friendly none of the overlap course applied to me) so I would research more into how many courses you need for your major/if you want minors/room for electives because Honors will take up room until Upperclassmen years. Honors cohorts can also be a blessing/curse because of the fact you\u2019re housed/taking classes with the same cohort long term, I had friends go through awful bullying by other Honors students. On the other hand Honors can help you make a lot of friends so it really depends.\n\nHUGE benefit is that Honors students gets a headstart on registering courses compared to the rest of your class; I\u2019ve never had to worry about my desired classes filling up before I could register. Big big plus.",

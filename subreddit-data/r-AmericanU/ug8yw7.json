I\u2019m moving to D.C. either in July or August and I need to secure a place to live \u2014 like soon. \n\nAre there any Facebook groups or platforms that would be more helpful and responsive than sites like apartments.com?\n\nI\u2019m open to any suggestions and if any other female students (don\u2019t have to be a student, but it would help) are looking for a roommate or a  place to live in the Fall please let me know!",

    "postText": "I have a bit of a dilemma. I am interested in the American University learning communities, specifically the politics one, which I think is a great opportunity and way to learn. The deadline for priority application, which means I would have guaranteed consideration for the learning communities, is Dec. 15. I also want to apply early decision to make sure my chances of getting in are as high as possible. My problem is that I have already applied early decision to another university, which I will not hear back from until probably after the 15th. So the only way I would be guaranteed to be considered for the learning community is if I apply regular decision before this deadline. Should I play it safe, and not worry about the learning community, and wait to apply early decision if I do not get into the other college? Or should I risk a lower admissions chance to be guaranteed to be considered for the learning community? What are the chances of getting into the learning community if I do not apply by the deadline? My GPA is 3.45  UW which is lower, but my SAT is 1420, which is higher. I also go to a competitive high school. I have pretty solid ECs and essays. I would just love to hear opinions on what is the right path. I'm worried about not getting in, but also worried about missing out on a good opportunity.",

            "comment": "I wouldn't worry about it too much, but I'd seriously suggest applying ED if you're open to it. I just graduated from AU in May but when I applied ED in Fall 2015 the ED acceptance rate was ~80% and the RD acceptance rate ended up being 25.7%. So if you think AU is for you, then I'd suggest taking the path of (almost) guaranteed admission, and then you can work out the details later. I was curious whether or not I'd be interested in joining a learning community freshman year, but I honestly forgot all about it after I arrived because there are so many opportunities available and people you'll meet through clubs, events, and more. I personally don't regret not being in a learning community during my freshman year. \n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any questions about AU or otherwise (@teddyc212 on Instagram). \u270c\ufe0f\ud83e\udd85",

I reserved a spot for UC (Death Penalty and Perspectives) since I'm really interested in criminal justice and took a forensics science course in high school. However, as a new college student, I'm worried about the amount of extra work that goes into it.\n\nIf you did UC, what was your experience? Did you find it worthwhile?",

I ended up emailing the coordinators and they found an empty spot for me and was so happy I did. It helps with a sense of community within what can be a hectic and overwhelming first year.",

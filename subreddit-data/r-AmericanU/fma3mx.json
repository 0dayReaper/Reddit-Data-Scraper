In this time where we can't really do in-person college tours, I'm using this subreddit as an alternate way to try and get a feel for the school, so- I was wondering what specifically about the university appealed to you and made you want to apply? Thanks!",

Turned out well for me. Worked in Don Myers and got tons of research opportunities, letter of recommendations. Now, I\u2019m working as a data analyst in downtown DC. So yeah, turned out well for me.",

Moreover it doesn\u2019t include all of the carbon (like student and faculty travel abroad for conferences) and was just a purchase of credits from wind/solar farms in North Carolina. Ask for the FULL REPORT- there isn\u2019t one.",

It was really nice (free breakfast and lunch!) and I love how the campus is centered around the quad. On nice days, students sit outside on the grass to chill or study. Its location is very close to the city, so it's really easy to get an internship related to government or politics (which is what AU is known for). I also really liked the School of Communication and the tour guide did a great job explaining everything.",

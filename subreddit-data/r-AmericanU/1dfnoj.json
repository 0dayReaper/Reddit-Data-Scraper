            "comment": "I should explain the situation. It started about 2 years ago when the landlord came down and told the boss they were remodeling the store, but not to worry that they will continue doing business with him. He accepted that and noticed the landlord occasionally bringing people down. Then last year he got a notice saying the lease was month to month assuming that they were going to close the store during the remodeling and he would not receive compensation. This was fine for him as long as he still had the place upon completion of the construction. Problem is though about 2 months ago a guy shows up claiming to be the new owner of the store. So the boss finds a lawyer and tries to save his store. They tell the lawyer that they are building an internet caf\u00e9 and dine in restaurant which makes 0 sense when the store is doing just fine(they also say my boss didn\u2019t express interest to renew the lease). Then last week we got our letter to vacate while the tenants of the apartment got a letter saying they were remodeling the store and adding a few features to the area. That contradicts what their lawyer told ours though, also when people complain to management they here all kinds of stories INCLUDING that we aren\u2019t leaving EVEN THOUGH we already have a letter saying that they are ending the lease.",

If you have questions I will TRY to answer what I can as their are lawyers involved and dont wish to jeopardize anything. I can answer stuff in person at the cafe if anyone wishes. Also the reason I am posting it on here is I know a lot of students live at Berkshire and AU sends students to the apartment.\n[Berkshire F&amp;D on Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/biz/berkshire-food-and-drug-washington)",

It makes me even angrier when they don't price anything so they can surprise you with $15 bottom-shelf wine at the check-out. It seems like what the Berks is doing to them is unfair, but to make the Berks store out to be this savior for the student residents is ridiculous.",

You want market value, go to Safeway. \n\nBut when you're hung over and need a $2.50 32oz powerade and a $6.50 greasy cheeseburger. That will be the best $9.00 of over priced food you have ever had. \n\n",

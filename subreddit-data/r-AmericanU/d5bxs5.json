I\u2019m not in the program so I\u2019m not exactly sure how it works. I\u2019ll post a link to the AU website describing the dual degree program.\n\n[AU-Columbia Engineering Dual Degree](https://www.american.edu/cas/engineering/)",

Yeah I think it\u2019d be very hard for him to get to Columbia with his stats, but yeah if being in the program means he\u2019d have a chance to get an engineering degree from Columbia I think he\u2019d be super interested. I\u2019ll let him know. Thanks for the info.",

I have a friend who graduated from AU and is now getting his engineering degree at Columbia. Your stats don\u2019t have to be that amazing in college either since Columbia admissions is more lenient (I think) with current undergrad students doing joint degree programs (there are other colleges/universities that also participate in the Columbia engineering joint degree program).",

He has a 26 on ACT, 3.84 unweighted GPA and 4.05 weighted, a 1960 on his SATs. His stats are decent but I think for Columbia it\u2019s a reach. It would be really nice considering Columbia is a top 5 school in the country.",

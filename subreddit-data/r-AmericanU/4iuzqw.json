    "postText": "Just got accepted as a transfer and I'm trying to decide between here and UC Irvine.  Both are about the same for me financially, so it really boils down to academics and career opportunities for me.\n\nObjectively it seems that UCI is the better overall school, but I think that DC as a location for an IR major can't be beat, far more resources and opportunities with internships, etc.  \n\nCan anyone speak to their experience at American?  I would appreciate any insight.",

I mean, SIS has been doing super well lately and I am even considering donating (despite those bull shit loan payments every month). If you apply your self, get good internships, use your professors and undergrad degree their gets you going to where you want to be. But yeah internships, they have really good access to them and if you want a job in DC working in IR it helps to show you have experience, well working in DC. Im currently at State because of an internship i had their senior year. ",

            "comment": "AU is \n1. In a safer neighborhood that rarely sees violent crime (we\u2019ll ignore the rapes on campus last semester for sake of argument)\n2. Even more liberal than GW\nSo, while it has merit to propose arming AUPD as it would provide AUPD with a rapid response option for a deadly threat at the University, it won\u2019t happen. A very loud part of the student population would rally against it. At least not until we HAVE an event on campus, which I pray never happens.\nFor those who say \u201coh MPD/secret service/other armed LEOs are just a couple minutes away\u201d let me give you some chilling numbers. It is extremely easy to accurately pull the trigger at a rate of 1 round/sec. In fact, I would consider 1rps a relatively slow rate of fire. Let\u2019s say it takes an extra 2 minutes (which is extremely optimistic for their response speed) for MPD to respond to a shooter on campus. That\u2019s 120 more seconds, (at least) 120 more rounds shot. If you have 2 rounds per person shot, that\u2019s 60 EXTRA people shot before MPD has a chance of response. It\u2019s simple math, more time for a response means more people dead in a shooter scenario.\n\nAnd yes, I expect this response to be downvoted into oblivion because I\u2019m not saying something that people like to hear. We can argue all day about how AR15s should be banned, but guess what. Virginia is right there across the river. Guess what they won\u2019t ban. Guess where a shooter would go to buy a rifle. It\u2019s not difficult to imagine the scenario.",

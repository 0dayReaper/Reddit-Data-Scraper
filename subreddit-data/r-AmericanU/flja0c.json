            "comment": "Late reply, but I 100% recommend the England Mentorship Program. Best decision I've ever made and had the time of my life. \n\nI strongly disagree with the other commenter: You have 7 more semesters and 3 more summers where you can intern, so why not take it easy and have fun your first semester? You also have the opportunity to study abroad again as an upperclassman, and many of my friends from the program have done that, so you're not depriving yourself of that opportunity.\n\nThere are only two real downsides to the program, in my opinion:\n\n1. The cost due to the lack of aid, though that applies if you do the DC mentorship program too. \n2. It can be a little more difficult to transition back to campus in the middle of the academic year. However, you'll be coming in with close friends who are in the same boat, and people are warm and outgoing throughout the entirety of freshman year, so you'll still be able to meet new people as long as you put yourself out there.\n\nMeanwhile, here is the opportunity you've been given: You can spend your first semester living away from home in a foreign country where the drinking age is 18! Bath, England is the coolest place I've ever lived -- it's a historical site and a college town all rolled into one. The people and the culture are wonderful -- it feels way more relaxed than the Northeast US, and the experience of living in a foreign country provides you so much more perspective on your own. You also have the opportunity to travel to all sorts of cool places on the weekends, since flights in Europe are super cheap, but it can be hard to convince yourself to want to leave Bath! Just make sure to always show up to class and complete all your assignments.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you want to ask any more questions. As you can tell, I'm happy to talk about the program.",

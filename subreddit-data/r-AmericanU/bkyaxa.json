Even though you live on the same floor with people you take the seminar with, there are other UCs on the floor too so you\u2019re not stuck with just them. I would say the program doesn\u2019t make or break your freshman experience though. Feel free to shoot me a message if you have specific questions!",

There are other UCs on your floor too so you aren't stuck with the same people. I did Environmental Science and had no regrets. \n\nThe class had a lot of \"labs\" where we would go out into the city and go to museums and learn first hand about the content we are going over. We went kayaking in the Anacostia river as well. \n\nThe UC program also has a second semester in which you can go on overseas trips and do specific research on the subject while having a bit of a vacation. I went to Nicaragua and did in the field research on the environment in the rain forest. Legitimately a life-changing trip for me because it made me want to switch my major.\nI don't recall if the second semester UC program is still ongoing though.\n\nGood luck with school and if you have other questions let me know.",

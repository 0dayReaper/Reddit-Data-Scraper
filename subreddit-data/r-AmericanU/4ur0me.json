Wherever you go, make the most of it, and don't go too far into debt doing so - you'll probably want to go back to grad school at some point and that's a whole other expense. Cheers and good luck. ",

            "comment": "JMU for undergrad and AU for master's here - my undergrad was a school of about 18,000 in a small town way out in VA, so the student body tended to be more cohesive I think. Most of us hung together at parties in the student housing areas, went to the same bars in town, etc.\n\nSince AU is right in the heart of DC, I got the impression when I went there for grad school that people meet up on campus and then tend to scatter to their respective winds way more at night and on the weekends - I guess freshmen have to live in AU student housing, but after that groups of friends move to various places in the city and the student body \"network\" seems way more scattered, if you could call it that.\n\nSo in a nutshell, AU students seem like they're less cohesive as a student body but more integrated with the community and the city.",

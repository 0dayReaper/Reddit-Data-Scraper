I personally have made like a ton of my guy friends playing open court, and possibly make an intramural team with the guys u play with. I\u2019ve met and are friends with a handful of grad students who play after their classes. Hard to meet \u201cchill\u201d ppl at AU, and I\u2019d say the majority of guys who ball at Bender are pretty cool ppl.",

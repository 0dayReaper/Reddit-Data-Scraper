    "postText": "Hey guys,   \n\n\nFirst time redditer here.  I recently got into AU's Global Environmental Policy (GEP) program for Fall 2020.  However, after a lot of consideration, I've been weighing out deferring due to the COVID-19 crisis.  Mainly because I am a high-risk individual (I have severe asthma and have been to urgent care many times because of how bad it can get).  I don't see a way that I could move to D.C. in good conscience without being really worried about being affected by the virus.  That said, I don't know if the GEP program even allows for deferrals.  I sent them an email and I really hope they do because I really don't feel comfortable moving there right now.  Does anyone know if they do accept deferrals?    \n\n\nAnother thing: If AU decides to go fully online, I could consider doing the coursework online for like a year (ideally by that time, the virus will somewhat die down), but I'm not sure if that's worth the money.  Do any of you have any experience with the quality of AU's online learning?    \n\n\nThanks for reading this and I hope you guys are safe and sound, wherever you are.",

            "comment": "I'm a current on campus grad student at AU in the IPCR program. \n\nAs for deferrals, I have no idea lol. I would call or email grad advising. \n\nFor online, it's a very different program than the one offered on campus. For the strictly online students I'm pretty sure it's a generic IR masters with concentrations, but it's definitely not the same as GEP. \n\nAs for taking the on campus classes online, I was pretty disappointed at the amount of money I was spending for a different education. But my program chair assured me that if courses were to be online in the fall, they would make the changes according to student feedback.",

I just don't thinking moving into a city while being high risk is a good idea, lol. And that's kind of what I was expecting to hear online wise.  If they do decide on online, I hope they fine tune it.  Thanks for the input!",

There is no time clock for your studies- why not stay at home and do some remote volunteer work or other work, and then join once things are guaranteed in person again? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the partial, and preoccupied experience.",

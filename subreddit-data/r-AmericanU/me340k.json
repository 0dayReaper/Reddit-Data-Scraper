                            "comment": "\\&gt; did you feel AU gave you a boost in career prospects?\n\nIf I had stayed in the SIS path of either joining the State Department, the Foreign Service, some other branch of the government, or any of the countless consulting firms  that are propped up around that industry, it would have been a boon. I decided to not continue on that path after graduation due to personal reasons, not because I couldn't get a job. Friends and colleagues of mine who graduated with me work for all types of places including the White House, major government agencies, and think tanks. Friends who went to the business school almost all had job offers with major firms before they even graduated. Friends who went to the communications school work for the Washington Post/more local papers and work in Hollywood for major production companies. Even then, I am currently in the \"waiting for results\" stage of applying for masters program in a somewhat related but still different field from IR, and I've gotten in to every program I have heard back from so far, and my current trajectory will be me being in academia.\n\n\\&gt; How does AU compare to other D.C schools? Specifically Georgetown.\n\nFrom an academic standpoint? Georgetown is Georgetown, no other school in DC can compete when it comes to name recognition or perceived prestige. I know one girl who got into Georgetown but decided to go to AU because they gave her a lot of money, and she didn't regret it. GW, on the other hand, is much more comparable to AU, and I know plenty of people who got into both but went to one or the other. They are more or less equal in most regards, GW may have a slightly bigger alumni network but its also a larger school. Hell, the year I applied, GW had a considerably larger acceptance rate than AU did. Howard is fourth, Catholic fifth, and the rest of the DC schools are not really worth talking about here. From a social standpoint? I wouldn't call AU a small school per se, but it's definitely the smallest of the big 3 DC schools. I personally liked that about it. All the schools have a lot of rich kids, both from the US and elsewhere. Georgetown probably has the most diverse student body of all of them but also a lot of 1%ers. But they all have frats and sororities, they all have a million clubs for you to join (at least pre-COVID), they all have different cliques so you can find your niche. AU is definitely the most secluded from the rest of the city compared to Georgetown and GW especially, but it really isn't tough to get downtown or to the cool neighborhoods, and in my experience its the Georgetown kids who don't really explore much of the city. Both GW and AU have a snarky reputation from Georgetown students about being full of Georgetown rejects, and while it is true that they both have students like that, I found that far more of them were at GW. Politically speaking, AU's student body definitely leans more progressive-ish overall (obvious exceptions in both directions), GW is roughly the same if not a touch more conservative overall, and Georgetown is fairly solidly Democrat establishment. This of course is a complete and total blanket statement. Also I can't speak for GW or Georgetown, but unless they changed something in the last year, AU is a wet campus, though there is nowhere to purchase alcohol on campus.",

The area immediately around AU generally is a mix of wealthy older people and other AU students, though you are bound to have overlap with people that go to GW (their Mount Vernon campus isn't all that far from AU) and Georgetown at least. Assuming you are living on campus, you, or your roommates, or someone on your floor will know people going to the other schools and you'll meet people there through that (moreso from GW in my experience.) I also did get an off campus job my junior year, with a staff made up of both AU students/graduates and non AU people. \n\nAU is definitely not a party school, a lot of the people (at least studying SIS or PoliSci or related majors) take the whole WONK thing a bit too far imo. DC in general does tend to attract the same kinds of people, so this isn't necessarily exclusive to AU. \n\nThat said, Greek Life is a fairly prominent part of campus social life, just less so than say the big universities down south. There are both social and professional fraternities and sororities, and they usually have an off campus house of some sort. I wasn't in any, but I was close with/dated people in several different ones and inadvertently lived in the AEPi spillover house when I got back from studying abroad my junior year. That said, you can still have a fulfilling social life without ever going to a frat or sorority party. Also as I recall, you can't rush until second semester of your freshman year, but they hold rushes twice a year.",

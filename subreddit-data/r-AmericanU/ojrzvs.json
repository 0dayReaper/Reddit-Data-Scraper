    "postText": "Let me provide some further context, given how terrible this is. Over the last year, I have worked hard to compensate for my poor GPA. Currently, I'm interning with two very high-profile people, which has given me the opportunity to work for some very prominent companies as well as other high-profile figures. Also, I have contributed a publication to Columbia University's website thanks to a hackathon they organized, to which I gained admission after applying.",

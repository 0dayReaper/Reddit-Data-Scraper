    "postText": "Hi I\u2019m an incoming freshman for the 2026, I was just wondering how is the sciences at American? From what I have seen so far nobody is majoring in Biology or anything health related or pre med related from the Instagram pages Facebook pages and college group-chats. I understand that American is a social science focused school but do they atleast have a decent pre med or bio program. There are no articles reviews anything about it and spending 60k tuition for a school that has not a lot to offer would be the biggest scam ever! Hope to hear from someone",

I\u2019ve taken bio 110 and I\u2019m currently taking bio-210 and calc 1. In each of those classes I\u2019ve only had good experiences with the professors and the lab TAs. The new science building (the Hall of Science) is also beautiful. I was really hesitant to come here for pre med but I like how the program is close knit. The pre med advisor also always sends out information about mcat testing and clinical/research/volunteer opportunities. Also AU wants to expand there stem numbers so they\u2019re really looking for students interested in this stuff. Also, I haven\u2019t felt like there\u2019s any of those weeder classes that are made to scare kids out of stem or weed out kids that \u201caren\u2019t fit\u201d for stem. There\u2019s a lot of support in the stem classes through the TAs and the tutoring center.",

I felt the same way my first semester I wanted to just go home really badly but you\u2019re already here and I think you should just reevaluate how you feel at the end of the semester. My first month in I was ready to throw in the towel and transfer but by December I found a friend group who I still see daily. It can really get better but you have to go into it with a positive mindset and good energy. It\u2019s easier said than done but just try to be positive abt being here give it a chance",

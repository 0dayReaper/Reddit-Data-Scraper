    "postText": "So I recently visited the school and the campus was absolutely beautiful, the buildings were gorgeous, it's located near DC, and the weather is great. Everything about this place seems so amazing, especially SIS. Walking into the building blew me away it was so awesome. The people seem kind and the professors, from what I've heard, are also top notch. The dorms looked nicer than I expected too. And on top of all that, American students get FREE rides on the metro.\n\nI am definitely applying ED1 come November, this place just seems perfect.",

It\u2019s still a pretty hefty fee (~$200 best I remember) calculated into overall price of tuition.\n\nThat being said, definitely be sure to take advantage of the UPass to explore the city. You already paid for it!",

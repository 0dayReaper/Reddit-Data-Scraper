    "postText": "I've done some research on the university's website but unfortunately it is not enough to really gather an idea of who is allowed to use the darkroom and when it is available. I would like to use the Darkroom for my own recreational interests but I am hoping to take some photography related courses next semester. If it's only open to those taking those courses currently than I can wait, but I just would like to know if I can use it now for myself even though I am currently not in any of those courses? ",

But you might first have to take a class so they know that you know what you\u2019re doing and won\u2019t break anything. \n\nIt also gets a bit crowded near the end of the semester when everyone\u2019s working on their final projects and people in classes get priority.",

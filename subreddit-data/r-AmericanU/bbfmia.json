            "comment": "In previous years, it was certainly much harder to get off the waitlist, almost impossible. However, last year, I was accepted off the waitlist and eventually ended up attending after already committing to another school (they accepted me the night before decision day). I say you have a pretty decent chance as long as you show continued interest. If I recall, there was a form of some kind or an appeal that I had to fill out, in which I needed to express why I wanted to come here even after being waitlisted. I think they also sent out another email, after reading over the appeal, asking if I could confirm my continued interest as they say me as a good candidate.",

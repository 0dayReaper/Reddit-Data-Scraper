You can can also take lessons with a faculty member for credit. AU does have an excellent recording studio tucked away in the Kreeger Building but it can be difficult to secure time. I'd suggest minoring in Audio Tech if you're interested in having regular access to that studio. If you're a pianist and have questions, feel free to reach out!",

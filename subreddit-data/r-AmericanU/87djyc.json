So if I did get off the waitlist, I\u2019d have to withdrawal from the other school and lose the deposit. Of course I want to attend, but I\u2019m worried about financial aid that would be given to me considering I\u2019m on the waitlist. Can\u2019t hurt to accept I guess, (going on the campus tour in a couple of days still), but I don\u2019t know if I even have a chance. ",

The deposit is a sunk cost, so it shouldn't factor into your decision. Make your decision based on future costs, not prior costs.   \n\nMore: [The Sunk Cost Fallacy](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/03/25/the-sunk-cost-fallacy/)",

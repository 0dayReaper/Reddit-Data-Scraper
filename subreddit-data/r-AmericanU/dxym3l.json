A lot of people are too afraid to transfer. Don't be complacent in being dissatisfied with spending exorbitant costs for a school you dislike. Find a place the suites you.",

It\u2019s getting much harder to get the right courses to AU to transfer elsewhere- for example most business schools require micro and macro Econ to transfer and with all the new Gen Ed, not everyone can get into that. But another university will take (less) money and give you the courses you want.",

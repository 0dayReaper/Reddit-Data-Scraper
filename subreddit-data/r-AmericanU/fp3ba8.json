Originally I needed to get all of my results in person, but as a result of COVID-19 my survey is available to people all around the country online. To participate in the 20ish minute study, randomly click one of the links below! You must be black &amp; white, 18+, and a college undergrad  to participate in the study. \n[Option 1](https://hoodpsychology.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_00suyfGrsoFTvRX) [Option 2](https://hoodpsychology.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0xo6qh8WMFU0AJf)",

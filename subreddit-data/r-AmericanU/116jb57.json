    "postText": "Hey,\n\nI am building an Ai that aids in lead generation (finding and contacting customers). The beta version will be available in 3 weeks and we are looking for beta testers. If you want to be part of it, you can send me your email in DM or you can register on the website: [https://leadsniffers.com/](https://leadsniffers.com/). My dm are open don't hesitate if you have any question!\n\n\\--&gt; Betatesters will have access to our Ai for several months after it is paid for\n\nHere is how it works:\n\nWe have an algorithm. You just tell us what you sell and what language you speak. Through databases like Google Business, LinkedIn,... we use a set of different criteria to narrow down the number of people who have a higher chance of needing your service/solution. Then comes the messaging part, our Al has analyzed the people he needs to talk to and will set up personalized information about them. He will communicate by email. The Al is trained to be personal and conversational so that you can begin to form a business relationship, he continues to improve over time so that he can refine his communication style for different industries and types of prospects. Of course, the Ai can simply look for the leads and put a message in draft without sending it.",

            "comment": "The major is very much based around a programmer and the computer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe program at the moment has you learn preliminary computer science principles along with two languages in the intro classes.   \nAfter that, you delve deeper into the science with Algorithms/Data Structures and Design of Languages. You have computer engineering facets with operating systems and computer systems. Then the rest is based on what your capstone and specialization is.   \n\n\nI'm not too familiar with what an IT major might look like, but I would say that this program is not it. I'd also ask if it is actually necessary to get a 4 year degree to go into IT? If I were you and I was set on looking for work in IT after high school, I'd look at what my local community colleges offered in terms of that.   \n",

What you described seems more system focused (instead of programming focused) which is what a lot of schools focus on for IT majors with intro level programming included.",

I actually wouldn't say that it's focused on systems. It's very general, probably because it's a smallish program. Feel free to visit and/or speak to the head of the department, he's a great dude!",

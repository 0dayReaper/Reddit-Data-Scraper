    "postText": "Hey, y'all! It's your digital tech credential campus ambassador here. Since we're in registration week, I just wanted to remind the freshmen and sophomores that if you're looking to add some fun and beneficial classes, I would totally recommend thinking about starting **AU's digital tech credential.** \n\nThe pathway is through **Kogod** or **SPA**, and it is *perfect* for students interested in gaining digital tech skills, but come from liberal arts backgrounds. The credential is notably recognized in DMV by a lot of prominent employers, and it could help you land a summer internship or a job when you graduate!\n\nLearn more about the program here: [https://www.american.edu/careercenter/colab.cfm](https://www.american.edu/careercenter/colab.cfm) and message me if you have any questions!\n\nWe're almost towards the end of the semester, hang in there everyone!",

I was lucky to get some experience in a few stats/data classes and my employer is now asking me to turn to a more data-oriented role, which will allow me to become a full-time employee in my office (currently I\u2019m a trainee). This program would\u2019ve set me up even better for that, and I know a lot of employers are looking for experience in this area. Stats and tech might seem daunting, but I promise it\u2019s worth it.",

                    "comment": "I completely agree! I'm currently a senior right now and I managed to pick up a minor in computer science and ITEC. Both minors are perhaps the best decision I've ever made because that coupled with my SPA major gets employers excited since I can run data analytics and other forms of programming for them. Honestly, people ask me more about my minors than my major at this point - employers all around are looking for people with hard skills right now. If you're worried about stats - def. don't be. There are a lot of services at AU that can help tutor you! The Kogod pathway is also more ITEC heavy than stats (and there's no math required for a majority of the ITEC courses)",

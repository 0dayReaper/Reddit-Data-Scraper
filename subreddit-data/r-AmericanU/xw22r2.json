    "postText": "AU is my top choice school as it seems like the perfect route for international relations. I\u2019m very passionate and outgoing, I have good ECs, lots of leadership, worked with house representative, volunteered with local congress candidates, and attended a diplomacy/IR summer program in dc. I also do competitive theatre and volunteer (have an officer position in both). By the end of HS, I\u2019ve taken 11 APs, I have great bonds with my counselor and teachers writing my recs. I also moved from Eastern Europe in middle school and the first person in my family to attend college in the US if that matters. I realize AU is selective and most applicants have those things, if not more, on their applications. The issue is that I had a bad GPA my freshman year due to a few reasons (no excuse but just how things went) which caused my cumulative GPA to be very mid. Is there anything I should try and do as a senior to help myself stand out or even be considered with my GPA?",

People are very opinionated and don\u2019t attend this school to challenge their political/other viewpoints but rather to find others who agree with their opinions so an echo chamber. Yes, I understand this is an issue at many schools but it\u2019s ESPECIALLY present at AU\n- Also if you\u2019re African American there are barely any other black students, lots of rich white liberals\n\nWith that being said there are students at this school who are happy and are the type of student the school caters towards",

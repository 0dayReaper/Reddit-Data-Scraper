So I can answer literally any question you could have about the program.\n\nOur public history MA is highly regarded, especially in the DC area. Our students have gone on to a lot of really interesting jobs at museums, organizations, government offices, etc. The director, Kathy Franz, is amazing and well-connected to pretty much everyone in DC, so internship opportunities through our program are incredible. Dan Kerr, our other public historian, has done great oral history and urban studies work. The two of them combined are an advising powerhouse.\n\nWe are very strong in visual and material culture, oral history, digital history, and museums.\n\nThis probably sounds a lot like an ad, but I am just really into our program. If I were to do a public history program, this would be the top of my list. You cannot beat this location when it comes to access to public history internships. Internships really set this program apart from others, even others in the area.\n\nI personally know almost all of the public history students, and they all seem very happy with the program. Many have gone on to PhDs if they decide not to go straight into the workforce, but students are not really struggling to find positions either, especially if they decide to move somewhere else in the country after they graduate.\n\nIf you have any specific questions, please feel free to get in touch!",

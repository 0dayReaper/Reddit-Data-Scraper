    "postText": "Hey yall, I'm currently transferring into AU for the Spring Semester into the School of International Service. I'm coming from a community college in NYC, so I was wondering what I could expect. \n\n1. I'm gonna be in Cassell hall, how are the dorms in there?\n2. What's the social life like for SIS?\n3. What's the work load like?\n4. Any good rock climbing nearby?\n5. Is there a running club?\n6. Hows the food?",

            "comment": "1. They're alright, better than most options on campus but nothing to write home about. I do remember there being a few problems with them when they first opened but I'm fairly sure they're more or less fixed now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) Not quite sure what you mean by that but there are public events at least a couple of times a week, whether an invited speaker or something of that nature. There is also Delta Phi Epsilon, the coed Foreign Service fraternity which is fairly popular.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) Really, really dependent on the classes you take and the professors you have, but I have never had anything unmanageable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4) If you have a car, then there are some places somewhat nearby (Crystal City, Alexandria). Otherwise, not really. They are both Metro accessible but its a trek.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5) Not that I am aware of but I could be wrong, I couldn't find anything when I just googled it and I know some avid runners but to my knowledge they don't participate in a club.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6) Not gonna lie, its not good on the whole. Its all done by Aramark, same contractor that provides food for lots of prisons (but to be fair, also a lot of other universities). Some of the stuff is decent, such as Global Fresh (which has a rotating menu each semester, this past it was Korean influenced). Freshii can be okay as well. The only consistently \"decent\" stuff however would be the big name chains (Subway, Starbucks, Einsteins) but they also only get so good. Stay away from TDR (the dining hall), not worth the trek for you or your stomach.",

Join the \"American University parent to parent connections\" Facebook group. During the day you have options, but on weekends or at night everything except Subway is shut down. Dining hall is frequently out of plates, utensils, cups, and food. Also huge health code violations.",

I've heard the first two years at SIS are the hardest, but still manageable to make free time\n3. It's really not that bad. Yes you have to manage your time well, but I've taken 17 credits for like three semesters and have always been able to find downtime.\n4. Not that I've heard of specifically\n5. Yes! It's a club cross country and track club, the people are great and it's super chill.\n6. If you're not picky, you'll be fine. You have options. I've largely stuck with making my own food in the dorms",

    "postText": "Hiya! So I\u2019m currently a freshman at American half way through my first semester, currently starting to plan courses for next semester, and was wondering if there are any Habits of Mind courses I should look into/take that aren\u2019t to stressful and are really interesting! I know what\u2019s interesting depends on the person. But I\u2019m just really struggling to find many I find interesting, and some descriptions scare me that one course or another will be a lot of work(on top of what I have scheduled already). Sadly most of the professors for many seem to not have Rate my professor ratings so I haven\u2019t been able to find out what people think of certain classes.",

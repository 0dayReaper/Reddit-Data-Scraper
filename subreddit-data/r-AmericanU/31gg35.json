Should I just sell mine and put it towards paying for college?\n\nI'm not sure if freshmen are even allowed to have cars.\n\n&gt;On a scale of 1-10 how great is spirit at AU?\n\nIt really depends on what you like. AU likes to bring up it's status as \"most politically active,\" but I'd take that with a big grain of salt. It was based on a survey were students were asked \"How popular are political/activist groups on your campus?\" So it's not necessarily the most politically active, but the school that *perceives* itself as the most politically active. And keep in mind that politically active has little to do with being politically informed.\n\nAs for other parts of the social scene, just know that it's a smallish school. You might like that smaller community feeling, but it also means there's few niche groups.\n\n&gt;I see that there is a lot of news surrounding sexual assault and violence at AU? Is this something that I really concerned about coming onto campus next year?\n\nNope. There was a thing last year where an underground frat's emails got leaked, and they said ...well, basically what you'd expect in private e-mails between college frat guys. Few people read the actual emails, and instead the rumor mill got churning and the story kept escalating. Just a couple days ago I heard someone say they \"raped a whole bunch of people,\" when in fact there wasn't a single actual allegation that came out of the whole thing.\n\nBasically, there's not any reason to think AU is any better or worse than anywhere else for sexual violence.\n\n&gt;How are the professors at AU?\n\nSame as anywhere. Some good, some bad. For the vast majority of professors, how much you get out of the class really comes down to the effort you put into it. There's outliers on either in, the really great professors and the unmitigated disasters, but who knows what the stats are for either group.\n\n&gt;Are you happy going to AU? Do you feel like it was a good investment in your future?\n\nMeh.\n\nYou should be asking yourself why American? If you are passionate about a career path where you'll need experience you can only get in DC, then you should consider American. If not, go somewhere a whole lot cheaper. And if you really do want that internship on The Hill or whatever, consider UMD. Heckuvalot cheaper.",

On the other hand, the bureaucracy and administration that runs the school is crap, its like pulling teeth to get anything done, and if you have a problem, no one will help.\n6.\nIf you have a reason to be here, come. Its a school for people who are passionate about their studies, otherwise its a waste of money, and your college experience.\n\nHit me with a PM if you have any more questions, happy to help",

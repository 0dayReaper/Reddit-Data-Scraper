    "postText": "Hello. Is it essential to live on campus if we apply for Honors program. I am very interested in the program but my family lives locally and I am planning on commuting, not sure I am ready for dorm living for the first year. Also any general advice on whether that is a bad idea? Should I worry about not having friends/ social groups as a result of living off campus. Nervous.. Thanks.",

If you have the option to avoid going thousands of dollars in student debt, do it. Your future self will thank you forever.",

Learning how to live (fail, and succeed) on your own is invaluable.  Take things a semester at a time and make your own decision, but from my personal experience I would say start in the dorms.",

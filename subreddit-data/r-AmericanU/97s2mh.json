    "postText": "I was recently admitted to AU's MAIR online program. At first glance, I thought this would be the same thing as in person. I recently saw it is distinct from the MAIA. I am wondering if it being advertised as SIS's online program gives it a lesser brand value? One of the main reasons I chose AU is because of brand value (hoping to get into management consulting / political risk analysis for companies). The admissions staff assured me it's not like when you graduate it is an MAIR online on the degree - it's still an MA from SIS. However, I want to be sure it doesn't impact marketability if someone is paying a lot.\n\nCurrent students or graduates of either program, is there reason to believe there is a caveat with this degree?

Turns out the online program is their biggest program when I did the campus immersion program. If you have any questions about anything, let me know. The SIS staff and faculty are very complimentary in connecting you and helping you career path . ",

I spent time in sales at a management consulting/market research firm, a couple investment banks and I HATE sales.  This aligns with my passions. That said I have concerns about employment outcomes? I know there is no \"placement\" but did you find internshipes and employer connectivity good? Please let me know your thoughts",

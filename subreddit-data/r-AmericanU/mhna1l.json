Letts get trash talked a lot but its not really any different and I think its getting updated soon.  Anderson is traditional format but the lounges are a lot nicer  Dorms are sort of just.. fine.  Wouldn't base your decision primarily off of them",

Is there a particular residence hall you would recommend, and how are the regular dorms vs suites in terms of value?",

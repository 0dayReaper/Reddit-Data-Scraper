On campus will charge me 10K for basically 9 months, while off campus is 12K for 12 months, also I have much more room and it\u2019s much more private. What do you guys recommend? Is the experience worth it at AU for on campus? Is it fun? That\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m even considering on campus. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Off campus is gonna be more than 12k per year when you have to factor in utilities and everything and it may be even harder to find a roommate since most freshmen live on campus (given when i was a freshman, AU required us to live on campus unless your legal permanent address was within a certain radius). Since you\u2019re forced to be on a meal plan, it\u2019s essentially gonna go to waste since you\u2019re not gonna travel to campus every time you wanna eat. Honestly I think it\u2019d be much harder to make friends if you live off campus since my floor freshmen year was so close knit and you can bond on the experience and just new environment and you always have people in the same boat as you. I know privacy seems like a big factor and I am an incredibly private person and have always had by own bedroom my entire life, but it\u2019s really not bad living with a roommate. Over all, living off campus your freshman year is a huge waste of money and you\u2019re safer on campus with like how much you have to go through to access each building.",

Nearly every freshman doesn\u2019t stay there during the summer so for December, May, June, and July, you\u2019ll be spending $4k on a place you won\u2019t stay in. You may find someone to sublet, but that can tends to always be a pain in the ass, especially when it comes to lease agreements, trusting that person to pay/sending you money on time since everything will be in your name, and take care of everything. If you\u2019re getting an apartment yourself, you should also be aware that the apartment complexes change the rent price based on when you sign your lease. I signed mine in May and ended up paying $300/month less than my friend who signed in August in the same building and same size apartment. \n\n2. I don\u2019t know what you mean by \u201caccommodations,\u201d but it\u2019s very hard to believe that you\u2019ve found a place close to AU that covers everything for $1000/month. If you\u2019re living in a house/apartment farther away, I can assure you that you\u2019ll need to factor in travel costs bc you\u2019re not gonna wanna rely on public transportation all the time (especially if it\u2019s early in the morning or late at night) and you\u2019ll end up needing to pay for ubers. \n\n3. You\u2019ll pay thousands for a meal plan that you won\u2019t use. \n\n4. The fact that you\u2019ll have trouble making friends is something that I think should be a major factor since you\u2019re most likely going to be on your own for the first time in your life. You may see it as privacy, but really you\u2019ll end up isolating yourself. Plus, there are a lot of on campus events a lot of freshmen go to and meet up with people, and you won\u2019t be willing to travel to campus every time to go to these things. \n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s your decision, and you came here asking for advice. I\u2019m a senior and I\u2019ve lived both on and off campus, and I\u2019m sure the vast majority of people wouldn\u2019t recommend living off campus. You\u2019d be better off putting that $12k towards your tuition or saving it in general for emergency money when you move off campus in the future.",

It will be way easier for you to make friends too. The extra few thousand is worth it in my opinion if you\u2019re able to pay.

You're gonna make friends don't worry about it. Again you won't have to live with someone else. For me privacy is the most important, it really depends on how much you like being in your own room.",

Your social life is going to be so much better if you\u2019re on campus, the experience of living in dorms really is worth having :)",

Honestly, freshman year is pretty corny and forgettable.  You should focus on getting good grades and one activity.  In the dorms there are so many distractions and traps, it's loud (door slamming is insane), disgusting, smells, constant fire alarms, etc.  You're going to have to do something to compensate for not having the built in social network of the dorm so it's on you to get in with a group so you don't have zero social life. You can also get involved in the community near your house which is cool and gives you more perspective.\n\nThis situation is what grad students do so it's not that big of a deal.  It forces you to grow up fast, hopefully you're ready for that.",

    "postText": "I loved American when I visited but I heard that their science department was really neglected by the school. I am leaning towards being an International Relations major but I also love Psychology and was wondering what the department is like. I was also wondering if you've done any internships how easy is it to find those opportunities and if you've found them helpful?\n\nThank you for anyone who answers!",

I work for the Statistics department and so far I love it. The smaller setting makes it easier to make friends and ask professors for questions. As for psychology, AU has a pretty good neuroscience program I think. THe new AU Hall of Science is for biology, chemistry and neuroscience. So if you come in Fall 2020, you'll be the first students to experience the brand-new HOS building.",

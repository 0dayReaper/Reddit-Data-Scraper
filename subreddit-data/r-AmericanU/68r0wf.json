He finished his classes a few years ago, and recently wanted to finish the language program so he could obtain his degree. Academic services that his credits have expired, and he needs to retake several classes. They weren't helpful when asking if there were alternative ways so he wouldn't need to retake classes. Has anybody been in this situation before? What can my friend do?",

Time Limit on Courses\nCourses completed more than six years before finishing a master's degree or certificate and more than nine years before finishing a PhD may not fulfill degree requirements. Individual academic units and programs may set lower thresholds. Exceptions are allowed if the Graduate Program Director can justify that the content of these courses aligns with current knowledge and practices and the Associate Dean of the academic unit approves. Copies of the written justifications and approvals must be shared with the Registrar.\"\n\nYour friend will have to file a petition with the Associate Dean to the Grad Studies Office to have the course count if I understand the regulations correctly.

            "comment": "Credits typically expire after 5 years for master's programs, sometimes less depending on the program.  That is why for master's programs, students need to show continued and demonstrated academic work in a short amount of time.  Some programs require you to take classes every semester (mine does).\n\nThe policies and regulations regarding taking time off/credit expiration should have been outlined in his student handbook when admitted to the program.  He also should have discussed taking time off between his classes and the language portion with his advisor.\n\nIf he didn't, my guess is he's probably out of luck.",

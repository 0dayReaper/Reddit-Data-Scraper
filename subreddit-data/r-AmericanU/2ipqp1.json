    "postText": "I live in DC and I have no way of meeting any AU students short of here and flyering. But anyway, I'm desperately seeking recording help. I'm a singer/songwriter who plays guitar as well. I have decent experience recording and producing but I would love someone local to work with me on at least a song, and I figured a student looking for more experience of some kind working with pop-type recordings might be interested. I'm not averse to payment of some kind also. If anyone has any friends interested in trying to arrange something or is an audio student themselves please let me know! \n\nsimilarly, I'm also open to new musicans to play with. I perform pretty regularly throughout the city and would love to have a band to work with",

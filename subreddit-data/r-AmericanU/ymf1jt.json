    "postText": "I'm on the edge about starting at AU for Spring 23 with a poli sci major but I don't want to end up with a devil's advocate in every class. Is everyone like overboard on politics or will it actually be fun to study gov in DC? Are there diverse views? Rather not have everyone share my exact opinion lol.\n\n\\*Side note: sororities? Good or bad? I'm from Texas so I'm cool with the real deal but am hoping for something more lowkey.",

American\u2019s poli sci program is one of the best in the country. \n\nPeople joke about the devil\u2019s advocate thing but it\u2019s not in every class. I only really had one ever in maybe two classes my entire time. There are diverse views and tons of great professors.",

Plus, she plays favorites and makes you feel inadequate about not knowing as much as she does, even though we're only freshmen. Also, only get your news source from NPR, she believes they're the most unbiased news source.",

Cold calling is there but it's to make sure that you are contributing to class. She is tough but fair. She challenges you and makes you actually want to do the readings.",

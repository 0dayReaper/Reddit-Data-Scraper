    "postText": "Want to see if anyone could give me their experience on the program or have anything to share. It's a very good school, but the cost is what makes me second guess going. How did you feel about your courses, internships, practicums, learning a language, and has it all been worth the cost so far? Thank you in advance.",

            "comment": "On the SIS website there are 15 different MA degrees plus 1 online, which have very different career outcomes. Use LinkedIn to find recent grads of your target program and see what they are doing a year or two out as well as 10+ years out. And call the Dean\u2019s Office or career center to get recent placement information for the target program. You can check government salaries online, and private sector/non-profit with glassdoor (only ballpark). Then google for Grad School ROI calculator to see if worth it for you considering current vs expected salary, tuition cost, program length, living costs, amount borrowed, loan APR, years, etc. Good luck!",

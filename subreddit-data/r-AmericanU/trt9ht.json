    "postText": "lil question about centennial hall. As a suite, this dorm is supposed to be more spaced out, with additional bathroom privacy. \n\nIf a freshman like myself were to request a double in centennial hall when portals open, would the additional space of the suite provide more privacy than usual with a roommate? Or is the difference between a suite and regular dorm in this aspect pretty negligible ? \n\nthank u \n\nalsoooo if y\u2019all have any dorming tips I\u2019d always appreciate it !",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! It's your Digital Tech Credential Campus Ambsassor here. I've seen a few posts about the CS major and other STEM-related majors at AU and what the programs are like. As a CS minor, I always wanted to do something that involved a little more hard-skills and an opportunity to apply those skills in a real-world context. Like a lot of students, AU has realized this gap and has now launched the **Digital Tech Credential Program**, where students in STEM majors can enroll in a pathway through CAS that is specific to hard-science subjects like data security, cybersecurity, and data visualization.\n\nIn addition to the great skills you get, you'll also get the opportunity to apply to exclusive internship programs, get prioritized for interviews when applying to companies like Google, Microsoft, Booz Allen, and Amazon, as well as gain professional development and mentorship.\n\nCheck out the program on the AU career center to learn more: [https://www.american.edu/careercenter/colab.cfm](https://www.american.edu/careercenter/colab.cfm)\n\nAnd be sure to come by the informational event hosted by me, the Career Center, and academic advisors from SPA and Kogod on **Monday, April 12** to learn more!

You can staff the two conferences (WIRC and AMERIMUNC) that AMIRS runs for high schoolers, if that\u2019s your thing. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing and have been really enjoying it.",

It's suppose to get you spiritually ready for the final selection. The final selection is held in a special court on campus to a sizable audience. Both teams battle it out on the court. The losing team is usually ritually dismembered to appease Huitzilopotchli with their entrails being place in front of Henry Kissinger's home as tribute. \n\n##",

You do not need an \u201cin\u201d, I knew no one on the MUN team and I made it on the team and I know many members who didn\u2019t do MUN in HS. Overall, if you have good public speaking skills and are a diplomatic delegate, you have a good chance of getting on the team. If you don\u2019t make it, you can still be a part of AMIRS by staffing AmeriMUNC and that experience is very rewarding. Overall, there are a lot of misconceptions about the team (from those who got rejected), so I\u2019d just ignore them and give it a shot!",

It is very competitive but if you can speak well and have great people skills you have a solid shot. You can also be a part of the conference we run for hs, Amerimunc, which is pretty fun. Definitely try out and join some branch of AMIRS",

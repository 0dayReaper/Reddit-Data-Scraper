    "postText": "I'm considering splitting an apartment in the Willard in West Friendship. The location is great and the rent would be cheap, but it's an old building, and I've seen reviews mentioning slow elevators, humidity problems, and pest issues. Overall, how good is the quality of life there? I'd be interested in hearing from anyone who's lived there or knows someone who did.",

When I was there, we had turned a 1BR into a 2BR and packed four women inside for the summer. It was fairly nice and I think I only saw a cockroach once. Granted I was up on one of the top floors. The elevators were super slow but the location is quiet. It\u2019s far from campus and a walk to the metro, but it\u2019s not a bad place. For the money, though, you could probably get a place closer and at the same quality elsewhere.",

The elevators are definitely slow. Other than that I thought it was pretty nice, the roof especially. \n\nI did look into living there myself but found that one of the complexes closer to the metro suited my needs better.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, I\u2019m a student doing the Washington semester program this spring at AU (I\u2019m coming from Illinois if it helps at all). I just have a few questions about campus:\n\n1. I got placed in McDowell Hall. Is that a good dorm or should I be worried?\n\n2. How\u2019s the political science department at AU?\n\n3. How\u2019s the food there?\n\n4. Student life? Any club or group recommendations?\n\n\n\n",

            "comment": "1) McDowell is in a central location so it\u2019ll be easy to get around. it\u2019s not great but nothing at AU really is. \n\n2) great department! \n\n3) the food is truly terrible but there are some days when it\u2019s markedly less terrible. \n\n4) there will be a club fair at the start of the semester but if you\u2019re interested in poli sci &amp; the like, i would recommend checking out AU Dems/the Republican equivalent (I forget what it\u2019s called), Kennedy Political Union, etc. we also have fantastic student media that\u2019s worth getting involved in/attending events with. there\u2019s lots of smaller clubs that do cool things - a sailing club and beekeeping society for example",

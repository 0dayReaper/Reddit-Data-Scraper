    "postText": "Hey guys, idk if a post like this has been made already (add a link if so pls!) But i was wondering if any current students at AU have pros and cons for this school. Some questions I have include, what the social life is like, how accepting is the community, how are the dorms/food service's, is the location ideal, etc.. Most importantly, of course, how great is the education system? Are there good advisors at the school? I got accepted under the Psychology major and if anyone else majored in psych please let me know how that department is!! Thank u in advanced to any replies :)",

            "comment": "this is a great school to attend if you are passionate about a cause, I'll say. everyone I've met in SIS seems to be here for the purpose of gaining a mastery they can use to promote a cause or specific purpose they're passionate about. But if you're sorta just generally interested in your area and want to understand it better that can get a little annoying because people tend to be less inclined to discuss things outside the lens of their own sometimes narrow focus. with that said, I don't know if that says more about SIS or international studies more broadly. \n\nThe campus is beautiful but it's small and fairly removed from everything. For undergrads, whose social lives tend to revolve around the campus/students, I've heard it's not great because the student body is fairly small and the school is somewhat removed from the rest of DC (at least from where everything is happening) so you aren't able to supplement your social life with everything going on in DC as easily.",

AU is (mostly) in one area and fairly accessible via metro and shuttle, so I would recommend you take that into account if u plan to live off campus any time in ur college career",

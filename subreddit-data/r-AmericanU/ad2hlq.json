    "postText": "Hey, I was wondering what kind of stats you need to get merit scholarships? This school is my top choice because I want to study poli sci, but I'm afraid of the cost to attend (would have applied ED1 if I knew I could afford it). I did the net price calculator, and it said it would cost about 30k/year after financial aid.\n\n* What kind of stats (gpa, sat etc.) do you need for the presidential scholarship?\n* This may be a dumb question, but if you get merit aid, does that affect the amount of need-based aid in your package that AU gives you? Ex: Someone gets 10k/year in merit scholarships. Would that cause the 30k/year package to change?\n\nThank you in advance!",

In high school, I had a 4.43 GPA, took mostly AP (9) and Honors classes, received all 4+ scores on the AP tests, and was part of the following HS activities: active church goer, multiple mission trips, church band singer for 5+ years, Rec soccer player, Thespian Society, Honors Society, Math Honors Society, Rotary Club, Robotics Club, Varsity Bowling, Forensics speech &amp; debate team member with multiple state titles.

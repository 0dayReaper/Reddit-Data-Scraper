    "postText": "I\u2019m a transfer student, and I feel like it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous that AU scrapes away every single cent from its students on every level. At a macro level, obviously our tuition is beyond out of pocket, but even little things scattered around piss me off. We aren\u2019t given a mini fridge/microwave for free (that was a given at my, and other universities), prices for food is insane (especially bc the food is hot garbage), eagles nest prices are insane, AuX literally costs thousands of dollars, moving off campus late incurs a 1-2k fee (when it quite literally doesn\u2019t affect them) and more. I\u2019m seriously regretting coming here and it\u2019s ridiculous at how stingy AU is.",

    "postText": "\nOptions I am considering:\n\nAmericanU:\n\nPros:\n\nIt\u2019s background as a polisci/international relations school could further my interest with the ethical side of biology \n\nSmaller school\n\nThey have a class that I have a special interest in\n\nI got in for my intended major and the mentor ship program \n\nCons:\n\nFar away\n\nNot many research opportunities \n\nNot a fan of the location \n\nFor the first year I won\u2019t be taking classes as a degree seeking student \n\nBostonU: \n\nLots of research I\u2019m interested in. \n\nAlso lots of interesting classes \n\nCalc(I\u2019m very worried about this for SCU, math is not my strong suit) is not a requirement for the major I\u2019m interested in \n\nI have family in Boston\n\nSmaller class sizes for CGS\n\nCons: \n\nI will be in CGS for the first two years and can\u2019t change that.\n\nFar away\n\nThey don\u2019t have a BS in Biology but I\u2019m not that worried about it unless it will hurt me when it comes to applying to grad school. \n\nSCU:\n\nLots of interesting classes as well\n\nSome good research \n\nNice campus and dorms(I\u2019ve actually visited)\n\nCloser to home\n\nThey have a Minor in Biotechnology \n\nSmall class sizes\n\nCons:\n\nHave to take a Calculus class for life sciences and physics\n\nNot a lot of research in what I\u2019m interested in(mostly human bio) \n\nTBH the people there seem kind of judgmental and snooty based on my interactions with them online.",

            "comment": "I wouldn't suggest judging a campus environment based on a Reddit forum for a specific college. Most AU students are not on here, anyway.\n\nThe mentorship program won't hold you back. I did it, too, and I am on pace to graduate early (if I want to).\n\nMany students here are political, but that's because they're the louder ones. There is a wealth of students who have no interest in asking your position on gun control or affirmative action the second you meet them, so if you're worried about political snobbery, you don't have to be.\n\nGood luck in your decisionmaking! I remember when I was in your position, and I agonized for weeks.",

I suppose, however, that my saying that isn't going to make things any easier!!\n\nIf you're totally lost and out of time in a few days, there are some useful tricks you can use to find where your heart really lies. One I like to do is having a friend or family member count down from 3 and once they hit 1, I have to say what's on my mind (from a range of possible choices or decisions). That tends to point me towards where my heart is at.",

If not admitted, they were waitlisted. Important to also remember that the majority of applicants admitted are required to enroll as most applied during the early decision rounds.\n\nInteresting to check out.",

Most who end up being admitted are through one of those two ports. Those who were accepted in RD like myself, are a fewer bunch. Many who applied RD were waitlisted (as not many students are rejected). \n\nBut yeah, pretty low yield.",

This school\u2019s biggest draw is location, but I would argue that the location itself is almost enough to merit coming here instead of other schools, if you want to study policy.",

I\u2019m planning to go to grad school in the LA or NYC areas since I plan on working in the music industry (maybe like Spotify or some records label as an artists manager or PR manager), and out of all of the schools I got into, AU is the only one with a specific program that can prepare me for that (Entertainment and Business, with specific tracks that interest me) that I can easily double major with marketing, or public relations if I choose. I get to also learn music law if I ever decide I want to go to law school and break into the legal aspect of the music and entertainment industry.\n\nWith college being really about who you know, AU definitely has that opportunity. Most students here are richhhh. At least, I know the incoming class is.",

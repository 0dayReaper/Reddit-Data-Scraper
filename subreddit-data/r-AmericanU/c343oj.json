    "postText": "Hey everyone. I'll be joining the SIS as a transfer for this upcoming fall and I have a question about aid disbursement. On AU's finaid website, it states that the AU Grant portion of our award package can ONLY be applied toward tuition. Is this correct? Or can those specific funds also be used for things such as room and board, rent etc?",

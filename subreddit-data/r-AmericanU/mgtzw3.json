Let\u2019s just say that I sadly didn\u2019t get nearly enough financial aid. I\u2019ve heard from several people that American is known to be stingy with aid, so I want to do everything and anything I can to get the aid that will make me going there possible. I\u2019m planning on contacting the financial aid office and appealing my offer but I was just wondering if anyone has any advice on how to get more aid. Any insight would be greatly appreciated!!",

They have a formal process that uses Google docs to appeal.\n\nBest of luck... unfortunately, like you, AU may be out of reach financially.",

I almost didn\u2019t apply because I thought it would be too expensive for me, best decision I ever made.  Best of luck to you all and I hope you get to go to AU. \nI think AU was always stingy with aid and I know they\u2019ve been laid out by the pandemic so I\u2019m sure the aid awards are much tighter this year.",

My experience is the financial contribution is a bit hard to prove and has more to do with overall family financial situation. You have to do the FAFSA and the CSS profile. My daughter\u2019s ex had trouble paying for school bc of family finances and his schooling was nearly paid in full, whereas my daughter\u2019s family (i.e. us) has a better financial standing (on paper, although unable to contribute much at all) and she received merit aid but only a trivial amount of financial aid. That\u2019s just our experience though.",

    "postText": "So what's the deal with on-campus parking at the moment? I tried calling earlier, but nobody picked up the phone. The website says \"Enforcement of on-campus parking restrictions is suspended until further notice for students, faculty, and staff.  Individuals will be able to park in general parking areas on campus without a permit or paying the daily fee.\" So I can park in areas that would typically require permits without one, such as Bender Arena and the East Campus Garage? Also, would I need to register my license plate with the university so they know I'm a student and not just some random guy?",

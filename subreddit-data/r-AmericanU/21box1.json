    "postText": "Hi, I was wondering how the party scene at AU was, as it is not really mentioned anywhere on the internet. I realize that everyone's opinion of a party scene is different so, how is it compared to, say, GW's? Also, is the freshman hookup culture pretty consistent with the other DC universities? I know Thurston dorm pops into my head when I think of that (GW).  Lol this is definitely important (not really) but I am just really curious! I have visited Letts but it was empty. Thanks!",

            "comment": "The party scene at AU is pretty much like all other private schools. Obviously at a state school things are going to be much bigger. \n\nBut in general the party scene at AU is determined by the fraternities. They all have open parties to start off the year, and they slowly change to closed parties as the year goes on. They'll still have one parties every now and then though. In the beginning try and get a bunch of frat guys phone numbers and you should be set. \n\nIf you're not into fraternities the bigger clubs on campus have parties as well, so do some of the sport teams. Frisbee and rugby are two examples of that. Clubs are honestly too numerous to go into, but if you join one you party with them, so its fun. \n\nHookups are also the same here as everywhere else tbh. Sure there are gonna be people who aren't into it, but its pretty easily available for those who do want it. \n\nEdit: Compared to GW directly its pretty much the same, especially in the beginning of the semester there's stuff happening on the floors. Partying in the dorms is always a risk no matter where you go, so just keep that in mind. \n",

                            "comment": "Story time!\n\nI was in one of AU's a capella groups. We had just finished a small show, and wanted to hang out, so we had some cheap wine, some solo cups, and headed to someone's dorm room in Letts. \n\nWe're having a great time, singing, laughing, being louder than we needed to be. This, of course, tips off the RA, so they come knocking, \"RA. Please open up.\"\n\nOh shit! We all scramble to hide everything we can. The bottles of wine  clink together; our cups go under the bed, in cabinets, or anywhere else we can hide them. Meanwhile, the RA bangs again, less patiently, \"Open up now!\"\n\nSeemingly settled, we open the door and the RA comes in. \"I heard bottles, where are they?\" We all play dumb: \"Not sure, must've been someone knocking into something.\" The RA is non-plussed but can't do anything but try to put on more pressure. \"I know you all were drinking, don't make this harder on yourselves than need be.\" Still no one talks.\n\nOf course, the RA is scanning the room to find any hint of wrong-doing. And unfortunately, he finds something! Someone's cup of wine had been hidden hastily under the desk, but not completely out of view.\n\nRA grabs it, obviously angry. \"Not drinking, hmm? What is this then? Y'all are in trouble.\"\n\nRealizing the proof is right there, I decided to fall on the grenade. \"Oh, that's mine. I'm over 21, I thought I'd have a celebratory drink.\" The RA jumps on his chance: \"Ah ha! Well you can't drink in the dorms. Give me your ID and info.\"\n\nLong story short, the RA only found the one cup which I claimed as mine, so my co-partiers couldn't be implicated. AU tells me I'm supposed to go to their silly rehab/life decisions/whatever-the-fuck class that occurs at 9AM, which interferes with the internship I'm doing. I let them know that I'm not going to their class unless they can accommodate my schedule, and I end up paying no fine nor doing any time.\n\nProbably not the coolest story, but fuck you, AU.",

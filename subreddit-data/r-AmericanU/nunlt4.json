They usually throw every weekend-ish, but some weekends will be quiet. Every frat I've been to required you to have one member of your group on a list, with few asking if everyone in the group is on the list. It's very easy to get on these lists if you meet people and get connections to the frats. This process isn't too hard but it has prevented me from going to some parties. All that considered, most frat parties are all right. They tend to be pretty cramped because a ton of people go but they always have plenty of alcohol. Again, this is all from my personal experience and it varies per person.",

Also, frat parties are NOT socially distanced lol\n\nHere's how they tend to go:\n\nSweaty. Hot. Even if you dress in almost nothing, it is gross. Shoulder to shoulder but not in a fun way. Loud. Cant hear person next to you. \nYou wait half an hour to push through a crowd for a shot of GRAIN ALCOHOL (please dont take the shots of everclear lol that shit is so high in alcohol content you can set it on fire....you can use sanitizer your hands with it, ya understand?). No chaser, theyre out. Doesnt matter when you get there. They pregamed before you got there and are out. Your best friend/roommate/ride home gets drunk and throwing up somewhere they shouldnt. You have to get them home because #LeaveNoOneBehind. \n\nYou start to smell and/or the place begins to smell of BO because that's what happens when you put that many bodies in a house and it's hot and people are breathing. You dont get a ride home, you have to walk. They dont want anyone to know the address of their frat house, so they sometimes give rides there....to sober people...but make drunk folks walk home because fuck 'em. It will be cold no matter the time of year, because you're sweaty and dc has chilly or humid nights. Also, when you get home - either you will be sick, or your roommate will be, from drinking too much or from the walk or what you ate. Someone will be getting transported to the hospital on your floor/in your building. \n\n\nAnyway, I moved off campus into the Berks as soon as sophomore year started (10 minute walk from campus and relatively cheap. Would recommend). \n\nI recommend doing what i did and making friends with seniors/grad students who have their shit sort of together and partying with them. Also studying with them. If you buy them food/use your meal swipes to get them into TDR so they can stock up for the week, you should have zero problems acquiring a senior year homie.\n\nI had pretty famous study parties at AU, and those are my fondest memories.",

That place is dope AF\n\nThere were some other spots, I'll try to remember. \n\n\nOh, definitely do rocky horror at E St Theatre for Halloween. Buy tickets a few weeks in advance. Way more fun than the busiest frat night of the year",

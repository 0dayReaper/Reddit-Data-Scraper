    "postText": "So this is my second semester on campus. Last semester I applied for a couple of positions around campus through the universities job application system. Unfortunately, I never received any news on the statuses of my job applications, not even a courtesy call to let me know I did not get the job. The same thing has happened this semester. So I'm here to ask more experienced students, how do you get a job here? ",

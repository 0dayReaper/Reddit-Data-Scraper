            "comment": "I\u2019m about to finish my second semester (I\u2019m a freshman). It\u2019s been really great so far, some really good professors/faculty, especially in the upper level courses from what I\u2019ve heard. The school also has amazing connections with Russian universities for study abroad, namely at MGIMO which is arguably the best university in russia, especially for IR/politics (Henry Kissinger called it the Harvard of Russia). Only like six or seven other US unis have study abroad access there. \n\nThere are also amazing professors at AU focusing on Russia/Eastern Europe within SIS, of course. I highly recommend it! I had no interest in Russian language at the start of last semester and now I love it, even though it\u2019s quite hard (though the courses themselves are super clear in terms of what\u2019s expected, it\u2019s not super hard to get a B/A if you put the work in).\n\n\nOne thing I\u2019ll say is that it takes 5 of your 16-17 credits a semester, so it\u2019s a pretty big commitment. You can still very comfortably do all your other classes/programs though, it\u2019s not a big deal. Kinda nice to only take five classes a semester while other students are sometimes taking six or seven.\n\n\nFeel free to ask me any Q\u2019s.",

There definitely is a placement test that you could use to get out of some of the beginner classes, but they focus on the main/basic grammatical system in first year so if you don\u2019t have the case system down well it could be helpful. I actually switched out of SIS but I\u2019m sure you could focus on Russia/eastern Europe within the school. Keith Darden  and Kornelia Bachiyska come to mind immediately as Ukraine/Russia focused people within SIS.",

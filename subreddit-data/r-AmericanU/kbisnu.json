    "postText": "i\u2019m applying ED so i know that will increase my chances a bit but i have a 1400 SAT and a 3.5 unweighted gpa. i have taken 8 ap classes and i have pretty good extracurriculars. i\u2019m in the band and do a lot of stuff in it. I\u2019m also in NHS and a few other clubs. i also work around 20hr a week if that matters. i think i have pretty good odds especially since i\u2019ve done a lot of the webinars and a few in person events but i am going to explode from anxiety so any reassurance would be nice :)",

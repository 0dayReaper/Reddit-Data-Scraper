Getting a job right out of school was somewhat tough, but that\u2019s any entertainment industry job tbh.  the program when I was there was pretty focused on live music, agency and PR stuff, but it\u2019s definitely expanded and branched out, and the professors are definitely willing and able to help you find jobs and internships (you need 1 internship to graduate).",

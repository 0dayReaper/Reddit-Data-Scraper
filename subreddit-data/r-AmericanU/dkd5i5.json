    "postText": "I\u2019m strongly tempting the idea of applying ED to American, but am still having some reservations as ED is no small commitment. I would love to ask some questions first. For reference I would like to major in either political science or CLEG. \n\nHow long is the commute to downtown DC? Do students go down there often? Being in DC is one of the most significant reasons I\u2019m drawn to American. \n\nWhat is the campus life like? Social atmosphere? Is it boring or does it feel like a community? \n\nWhat is the food like? Food options? I do not have any dietary restrictions.\n\nI visited AU a little over a month ago. I wasn\u2019t a big fan of the campus, but I think all of the construction and heat may have been the biggest turn-off. What are your personal opinions of the campus? The dorms? I would like to visit again but it\u2019s slightly difficult as I don\u2019t live nearby or at a distance where I could visit without renting a hotel room for the night. \n\nI\u2019ve heard both good and bad things about American\u2019s financial aid. What has been your experience with it?\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to answer any of these!",

            "comment": "To answer your questions and add some additional points:\n\n1. Getting to downtown isn't a bad commute, probably 45 minutes to an hour depending on where you're going. If this is a priority for you, GWU is closer if that happens to be somewhere you're considering. \n\n2. Campus life can be pretty active, but you have to still keep your eyes open if you're trying to find your niche. There are plenty of student groups to join. \n\n3. Food options are pretty standard for college fare, but aren't strong even so. AU kind of exists in a bubble, so finding things outside campus requires public transport outside of the options in Tenleytown. \n\n4. Personally, the campus and traditional college feel sold me on AU, but there was far less construction. The dorms are alright, but in my opinion it's best to move off campus quickly from a dollars and cents perspective unless you have some aid cozvering room and board. \n\n5. I personally had no luck with AU student aid, but I knew people who had plenty of aid. If you have aid covering enough of the cost, it's worth it. But to go without much aid could end you up with more debt then you'll be able to work with after school. And this is just bachelor's. If you want to get a master's you need to think of that cost and when you might go for it. \n\n6. This leads to a last big point, and that's what you'd like to do after school. Do you have any plans at the moment? Being so close to government is a huge benefit to going to school in DC. I didn't end up using my poli sci degree for that, but it's something to consider. Happy to talk about that aspect too.",

                    "comment": "Thanks so much for taking the time to answer! To address your last point, my dream is to work in DC in politics or public policy (or some form of the federal government). That\u2019s the most significant reason why I\u2019m hoping to attend college in DC; I\u2019d be able to explore if I really want to one day live and work in DC, and I believe American would be incredibly helpful with the opportunities and internships it can offer. And I believe American is the best fit for me academically and opportunity-wise, rather than Georgetown or GWU. Not that an hour commute is terrible, but I\u2019ll be glad to handle that than go to a closer college that won\u2019t fit me as well. \n\nI personally thought American had the opposite of a traditional college feel! But perhaps I got the wrong impression. We didn\u2019t have a student-led tour and I probably missed out on quite a bit. I\u2019m going to try to research it more online, though I don\u2019t think I would not apply early decision simply because I\u2019m not in love with the campus. The educational opportunities and location are most important to me.\n\nMy family isn\u2019t poor, but we aren\u2019t rich enough to be spending several tens of thousands of dollars each year. Aid is pretty significant to me, which is the largest reason why I\u2019m hesitant to ED. I\u2019m applying for scholarships, but it\u2019s competitive. I had wanted to get my master\u2019s but it hasn\u2019t been as big of a dream of mine as working in DC, so I\u2019m not entirely sure if I\u2019ll be going that route. Any more advice you have would be awesome, and thanks again.",

As for the campus, it really is what you make of it. There is hardly any school spirit and if you want to do things on campus you're gonna have to join clubs as I find the sports scene is kinda dead here. Otherwise DC offers a ton of things to do and you shouldn't be bored of the city anytime soon. Otherwise, the campus is nice enough. I live in centennial and it's a little old. Letts is worse while Anderson is the newest. Centennial is also the most socially dead while Anderson is the most socially active. As for the overall vibes it's okay. People are nice enough even if they aren't the kind of people I'd hangout with normally. I had a small circle of friends in high school and we were all pretty nerdy in a much more nerdy high school overall than AU. However my professors are all good to great, especially my IR teacher.",

            "comment": "I actually prefer the AU campus to GW. AU is located near a quiet(and wealthy) residential area where it\u2019s pretty safe. It\u2019s the perfect place to school. Going downtown isn\u2019t so bad since you can always hop on the shuttle and take the red line. You\u2019re given a U-pass which allows you to take limitless transportation(included in the tuition). Unlike the GW \u201ccampus\u201d, it\u2019s entirely integrated with the offices and downtown. 70% of the people on their \u201ccampus\u201d probably don\u2019t go there. There\u2019s a lot of homeless people, ambulances, police patrol since it\u2019s in downtown. I think the campus is why a lot of people chose AU over GW.",

            "comment": "Full disclosure. I transferred out of AU after 2 years. \n\n&gt;How long is the commute to downtown DC? \n\n45 to an hour. It's gonna be Wonk Bus -&gt; Red Line, which will bring you right downtown, maybe a quick transfer depending on where. \n\n&gt;Do students go down there often? \n\nOn weekends absolutely, but given the transport time it's a day trip type deal. \n\n&gt;Being in DC is one of the most significant reasons I\u2019m drawn to American.\n\nNorthwest DC does not feel like DC. It feels like any other suburb in the country. If you want DC, GW or Georgetown is probably gonna be a better option. \n\n&gt;What is the campus life like?\n\nHonestly, pretty dead. There will be some frat partys off campus, but on campus can feel dead at 9pm on a friday. \n\n&gt;Social atmosphere? \n\nCliquey. Very wonk focused. People tend to hang out with the people in their major and just talk about that 24/7. \n\n&gt;Is it boring or does it feel like a community?\n\nPretty boring, def feels like a commuter school. School pride is very weak. There's some good people, but I don't think you will get the feel of community from the school itself. \n\n&gt;What is the food like? Food options? I do not have any dietary restrictions.\n\nUnless Chartwells has changed things dramatically, pretty bad. 3 main issues:\n\n* Lack of hygiene. Food is just nasty, I got sick multiple times.\n\n* Lack of care/taste in the food. Ingredients are bland and cheap, nothing really tastes good. They managed to fuck up cookies 98% of the time. cookies!\n\n* Lack of rotation. Almost the same food every day\n\nSo you get the same bland digusting food every day. Not great. I've spent at least 3 weeks on Northwestern, Emerson, Occidental, UCLA, and UChicagos campuses. Every single one is better than AU. \n\n&gt; I wasn\u2019t a big fan of the campus, but I think all of the construction and heat may have been the biggest turn-off.\n\nConstruction is definitely a bitch, but other than making it annoying to find my way to class it didn't really bother me. I don't think it made the campus *that* much worse to be honest.\n\nThe heat in late July and early August is terrible. Luckily, you will arrive once it starts to cool down and will leave before it gets really bad.\n\n&gt;What are your personal opinions of the campus? \n\nSmall, quiet, boring.\n\n&gt;The dorms? \n\nPretty bad tbh. Housing office is absolutely terrible. Mold, mice, and AC issues are rampant. I'm in the worst dorm on campus at my new school, it is a considerable improvement.",

I am queer and was wondering what I would expect if I attend here. Is it homophobic? Is there a decent amount of queer students that attend? I would appreciate any feedback. Thank u!",

And as a recent GayU student I can definitely vouch for LGBT life both on and off campus, not just in terms of the dating pool, but also just as an LGBT-friendly school and city! \n\nAU really does care about prospective students demonstrating interest so if you're interested I'd definitely try to shoot your regional admissions officer a well-written email introducing yourself, explaining why you're interested in AU, and asking a couple of open-ended questions that gets them thinking a bit, *the answers to-which you won't be able to find on AU's website* (e.g. How would you describe the political culture on campus? How would you describe the LGBT community on-campus and how could I get involved myself?) (please come up with your own questions \ud83d\ude09) \n\nIf you're applying in the next few weeks I'd try to send that email this week, and if you're applying next year I'd open that dialog late in the summer, maybe a week or two before your senior year starts.",

With no one on campus now, they have obviously abated.

Whenever we introduce ourselves or sign off an email, all the students + faculty include their pronouns; that's just become the norm for us. Very liberal school.\n\nEdit: we have a considerable LGBT population. in one of my classes, there were 5 out of 14 students who were openly queer or bi.",

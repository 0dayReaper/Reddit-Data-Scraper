    "postText": "Two days ago I received a call from AU letting me know that my ED application had been accepted. Today I got my official acceptance letter in the mail and saw that I was awarded the Dean's Scholarship for $10,000 a year. \n\nAU is absolutely my first choice, and I've fallen in love with the school the several times that I've been on campus. I definitely know it's the right choice for me, but the cost is staggering. My parents will submit the forms for need-based aid, but we suspect that we'll fall squarely into the bracket that makes too much for significant need-based aid but not enough to pay for full cost of attendance (even with the $10,000 I will receive). \n\nWith this all being said, are there any other avenues to take in order to lower this cost? From what I've read I am a fairly strong applicant, and would probably be able to attend with another $10,000 in aid from some source. \n\nAny advice/experiences are appreciated!\n\n",

It may be a pain to get to campus but if you want to save money in the long run that is your best bet.\n\nLearn to cook. Don't buy a meal plan. Groceries are cheaper than TDR and you can eat much healthier. Plus cooking is fun.\n\nGraduate early if you can manage it. A semester's tuition is significant. Don't stay just because you want to. If you can get out do it.\n\n*Source*: I graduated this semester and my sister graduated in 2012. We both lived off campus and graduated early.",

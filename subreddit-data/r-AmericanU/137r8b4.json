    "postText": "Hi! My friend got a ticket for parking in one of the decks without a parking pass. They don't want to pay it. Can they get away with this? They will be graduating this year. Could AU hold their diploma if they don't pay it? The school doesn't have any way to connect them to the their car. Or could they use the license plate number to track them down? \n\nLet me know! Thanks!",

            "comment": "Hey there, catching up on the sub\u2019s posts lol. I used to work for parking on campus within the last few years. If this is their first ticket, they should go to the office cause the first ticket is always voided as a courtesy. Otherwise you could just leave it be and it usually won\u2019t do anything. Yes it\u2019ll rack up late fees but as long as they don\u2019t have 3 or more unpaid tickets nothing they can do. Just be careful because if they do get 3 or more tickets unpaid they can and will boot your car. \n\nTechnically they can stop you from registering and stuff like that but the systems literally aren\u2019t connected so unless they actually run reports (which they don\u2019t last I checked) you can graduate with thousands in fines lol. Hope that helps!",

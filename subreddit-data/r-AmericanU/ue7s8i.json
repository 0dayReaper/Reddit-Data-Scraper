    "postText": "I don't know where to start. I'm currently at a crossroads between American University and UAB. I really want to go to UAB, but given my mental health, my parents suggest going to American University (which is actually 20 minutes away from my house) instead. I still have till May 1st to decide, but I wanted some insights from people who currently go to American. I know for a fact that UAB is more or less full ride for me, while American (if I stay at home) might come down to 40-50K per year. I'm currently a neuroscience major, and just wanted any last opinions from people who go to the college.",

In terms of overall academics, I think AU is pretty good. Professors can be hit or miss, but I\u2019ve definitely had some really great ones during my time here (and certainly some bad ones). Have you toured either yet? I think visiting the campuses definitely helps narrow down your decision.",

This extends beyond just \u201cCapitol Hill staffer\u201d so I would consider AU comprehensively good for any public sector job.\n\nAU\u2019s STEM depts/fields are on the upswing (both in quality and in funding), but are still a little bit behind what other major universities consider to be standard.\n\nOur business school is pretty good. I won\u2019t give business majors any praise beyond that (joking).\n\nIf you want to do something medical such as nursing or applied medical research, AU is NOT the place (yet).",

Personally, the only reason I went with AU was because of my financial aid package and because I wanted to be further away from home.\n\nNot having to worry about your finances is a big help. Like \"I don't gotta stress out about failing a class and losing all my aid\" type of help. Not putting a financial burden on your parents is also good. Being closer to home at times can also be good, I am 3-4 hours away from home and each semester I stay here for spring/fall break it wrecks me mentally.\n\nNow to be considered is that if you are doing Neuroscience you might have to do something beyond a Bachelor's Degree, in which case it won't really matter what your first institution was when you can do your Master's and/or PhD at another institution. Going with an institution that will place no financial burden on you when you have other 2-8 years of schooling to do would be smart.\n\nI would also say, that although AU is improving it's STEM field, it is not as good as other institutions recognized for their STEM curriculums. I am a STEM student, I initially did Biochem but had previous experiences with science classes at another institution and the experiences were quite comparable despite AU being way more expensive. The only thing that AU has going for it is that you can get lab experience pretty quickly. I was a biochem major for 3 semester and I managed to get into the projects staff carried out all three semesters.",

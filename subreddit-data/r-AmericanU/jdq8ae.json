I'm a student at another law school.\n\nProfessor Roger Fairfax, who normally teaches at GW Law and American, is a visiting professor at my school and he's teaching Criminal Procedure.\n\nI'm the first in my family to go to college and I'm really struggling in his class.\n\nI was wondering if someone could check the American Law School test bank to see if there's any practice exams from his class? Also, if you've taken his class and have any advice, that would be really appreciated!",

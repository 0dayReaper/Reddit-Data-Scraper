            "comment": "I don\u2019t think that any problems I had with covid and school were specific to AU. I\u2019d say they were problems that every school has when they switch to online learning. It\u2019s harder to learn and you lose supplemental resources so classes can be more challenging and stressful. The obvious zoom fatigue and just not being receptive to online learning/not having a proper learning environment in my house (that\u2019s me personally). I do like though that professors had to hold online sessions versus when we shut down in spring 2020 and literally all of my professors just stopped teaching and essentially just ended grading at that point. I can honestly say that I\u2019m not learning as much as I have in the past, but I\u2019m sure that would happen for me at any school in this situation. Professors generally have been more understanding, but I would say some of them just made too complex of assignments that weren\u2019t compatible with virtual learning.",

And I will say it's hard enough to move to a new city to begin with, but especially so if you move there and don't actually go to school where you can meet people. I have no obligations which require me to leave my apartment, so it's been near impossible to meet people here. School really just feels like something I do on my computer sometimes. If it was like this for the entire time I wouldn't do it.",

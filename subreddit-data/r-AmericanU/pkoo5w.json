External transfer students matching this   \ncriteria must submit their transcript, and should work with their   \nadvisor to apply an exception to the student\u2019s degree audit. These   \nstudents should enroll directly into a section of AUx2. https://www.american.edu/provost/undergrad/auexperience/faq.cfm",

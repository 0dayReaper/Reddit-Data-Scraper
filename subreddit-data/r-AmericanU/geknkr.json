Same job can go to hundreds of schools, unless only want local options. Compare your Handshake options with a friend at a different university. But the AU Career Center can say it posted thousands of jobs from thousands of employers.",

The owner/founder of the DC-based company is on the AU alumni board. My friend had had a fellowship fall through and he looked around and the Handshake thing just went Boom and put him in this opportunity. It's been a dismal year for college graduates across the country and I think a lot of recent graduates have gotten the big hose. Bottom line, you should connect with Handshake and ANY OTHER MEANS of getting in touch with a potential employer.",

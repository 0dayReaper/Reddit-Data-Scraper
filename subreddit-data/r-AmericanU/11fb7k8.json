They are different because one is a public research institution with over 50k students over 170 majors, and the other is a medium sized private liberal arts college with 14k students and 60 majors. Rankings definitely DO NOT tell a story worth reading.",

If you wanna work for the gov prestige isn't huge just networking and honestly willingness to take a lower salary, so yeah it doesn't tell the whole story in that matter.",

I think that the school *can* be fun if you find the right crowd/clubs/friends however, even if you don't find the right people DC is a great city with an amazing and rich culture outside of all the government/hill/corporation bullshit. I also think that the administration will screw you over any chance they get but this is the same among all academic institution's. AU as a culture though is super annoying, neoliberal and pretentious. Overall, I say go for AU if you think you would love DC but beware of the student population and culture!",

SPA and SIS are very connected in DC and would provide great opportunities. So if you\u2019re interested in Law and Politics, it\u2019s not a stretch to say a majority of folks at AU will have similar interests as you. They are very intentional with building a like\nMinded community. Austin would also be strong in those areas and would have internship opportunities as well. As strong of internships and guest speakers as DC schools in those fields\u2026probably not. The White House, Capitol Hill, DOJ, and more are only in DC. But you\u2019ll also be around 40k plus undergrads and on a much larger campus in general. Only you will know what feels better to you. Just have a well rounded experience at whatever place you go.",

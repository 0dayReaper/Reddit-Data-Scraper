Left on campus housing after freshmen year and never paid more than 800 a month for housing. I also didn't have health insurance so it was an additional 3k a year for school health insurance.\n\nI graduated with around 80k worth of loans, which were all federal loans. Housing and cost of living are intensely expensive in DC. I think at least if not more than half of the loans I have are just for housing and cost of living.",

Financial aid told me I was already receiving the maximum aid possible outside of scholarships, so it didn't stack lol.\n\nI think a good 90% of the kids I met at AU come from well off families and think they're middle class. That part really got to me a lot because people wouldn't believe how poor you are since everyone in college is \"poor\".\n\nThere's a lot of diversity at AU in terms of cultures and identities, but there is little diversity in socioeconomic status. The POCs, foreign exchange students, the sexual minorities, etc are all mostly well off or comfortable.",

Also agree that there were a lot of upper-class and upper middle-class kids who didn't have a clear idea of how much wealthier they were than the average U.S. citizen.\n\nFreshman year, I was the only kid in my friend group who even went to public school, never mind that my school was in a pretty working-class city and somewhat on the rough side (my upbringing was middle-class, so I def didn't come from poverty myself). I only ever met one student who grew up in Southeast DC; kind of embarrassing for AU in my opinion.\n\nDefinitely a bit of a culture shock. \n\n(Total aside: Nice to meet a fellow pk AU alum ha ha. There weren't many of us. Tho my mom is a UCC pastor, our church growing up was split UCC/Methodist. The Methodists were a little more conservative on average, from what I can recall since the UCC can be somewhat progressive for a Christian denominations, and liked her less because she lead the church through Opening &amp; Affirming.)",

AU cut salaries for President (15%) and VPs (8%), but that means President still makes over $800k and some VPs will still make over $500k. No other salary cuts except no performance bonuses except to staff under $40k. So AU will need to charge full tuition to as many students as possible.",

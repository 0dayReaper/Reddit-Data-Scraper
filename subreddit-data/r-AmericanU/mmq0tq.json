    "postText": " Had a quick question on the difficulty and reputation of the CS program at AU. While I know poli-sci, international relations, etc. are the big draws I wanted to get some feedback on how good the CS program is overall as well as the difficulty. From a review of the required classes it seems like it is easier that engineering schools, but this is expected as it is a liberal arts college.  Regardless of perceived difficulty I wanted to see how good the classes, material and professors are.  Are the classes easy enough for someone with no prior CS experience to pass or are the difficult and more of a weed out process? I know some schools use these initial classes to let incoming freshman see if CS is \"right\" for them (AKA - weed out).  Are there enough opportunities for internships and research opportunities?   \nThanks",

Do most of the CS majors gravitate towards a math minor or something else?  My concern was that while the STEM program is up and coming that the administration may treat is like the 'second child' and not give it much attention.   Any comments on that?  Not just the administration but the student population as well.  Thanks.",

            "comment": "As a CS minor, my upper-class CS classes were absolutely fantastic. I kind of struggled in the intro ones because I had very little background, but the tutoring service and TAs are always really great and super helpful. Professors are also really understanding that this content isn't easy and are always willing to work with you in case your grades are falling behind. If you're also interested in gaining tech skills, but kind of want to remain a little less on the hard-science part, you should check out the [DTC program](https://www.american.edu/careercenter/colab.cfm)! It's pretty much designed for students in liberal arts schools to gain and enhance their digital literacy skills. You should also check out the ITEC minor through Kogod to aid your CS major. Good luck!",

    "postText": "I was recently admitted to grad school at AU and was wondering if anyone had any tips on finding a decently priced but also safe place to live near campus. I originally wanted to live in a studio or 1 bedroom but with how expensive everything is, I would like to find a roommate. I've never lived in a big city and would appreciate any help lmao. Thanks!",

I lived there in 2021, I'm not sure about prices now but at the time it was affordable compared to other apartments. There are a few other places on Mass Ave but the Berks is like a 5 minute walk to campus.",

Or are you bringing a car and intend to drive to school? \nIf you\u2019re looking for walking/metro distance look for the neighborhoods of Tenleytown and Friendship Heights, and if you\u2019re driving look more towards Bethesda and Chevy Chase in MD or Arlington and McLean in VA.\nThere\u2019s not really any place near school (inside the 495 beltway) that I would consider \u201caffordable and safe\u201d\n(Edit): as far as finding roommates there\u2019s some online forums, and some discords that I\u2019d recommend checking out.\nThis is the school discord hub and a decent place to start.\nhttps://discord.gg/qeVGTh48E3",

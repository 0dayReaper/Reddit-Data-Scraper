I recommend carefully selecting some classes that apply for both degrees to make your life easier so when those niche classes you really want to take come up you're not concerned with completing all of your degree requirements.",

Ask around when you start looking at specifics (feel free to PM me) about which classes to take together, which profs aren't gonna give you hell. ",

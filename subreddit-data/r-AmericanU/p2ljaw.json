    "postText": "Hello so I\u2019m an incoming freshmen so I won\u2019t have to worry ab this for at least one more year, but how does ANYONE afford living off campus? Im already going to be living super tight from the $$$$ to attend alone, let alone living in one of the most expensive cities in the country. Any advice on how to do it, other than getting a 1/1 and splitting it with 5 people \ud83d\udc80",

            "comment": "On its own it's fucking expensive. But if you look at how much AU is charging you for housing, you'll realize that switching to off campus could actually save you a bit compared to what you're already paying. I forget what I paid freshman year, but I know that my off campus rent junior year was somehow lower than the on campus housing of sophomore year, despite the off campus housing being overpriced af.",

It\u2019s honestly not terribly hard if you\u2019re willing to put in effort to look outside of The Berks and the Av. It probably won\u2019t be as shiny, sparkly new as campus, but it\u2019s a place to sleep, study, and drink. We found a realtor who really knew how to handle student housing in the AU area.",

Don't need gucci to get an education. \n\nBe a live in nanny (can find jobs on quadjobs once you have an AU email). Look on AUhousing groups on Facebook. Get a roommate and live in a studio, but use it like a dorm. Don't go ovrr budget for anyone. If your friends have 1200 to spend a month and you don't politely decline to live with them, I made that mistake and nearly dropped put of school to manage my 1000 a moth rent, fuck that. Craigslist, lots of people rent out their basements in this area (use caution of scams). \n\nDO NOT BUY COUCHES TVS ECT. IF YOU ARENT LIVING IN THE SAMEBPLACE FOR ALL 4 YEARS. MOVING COSTA WITHOUT A CAR ARE GOING TO BE MINIMUM 500$. if you do buy furniture tho craiglist and rent a uhaul. \n\nGood luck!",

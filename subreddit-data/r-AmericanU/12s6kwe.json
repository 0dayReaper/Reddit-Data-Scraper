Scared for my gpa\ud83e\udee0\n\nHow bad's the curve? Any professors to stay away from? Any advice? \n\nI'm in PoliSci btw :)",

When I took his class last fall (Fall 22), he was entirely virtual, which further dropped my engagement with the class. I still did decently well fwiw, but I didn\u2019t have fun in the course. There are other professors at AU with connections that actually make themselves accessible to students. He does have a killer lineup of guest speakers though. Was fun asking them questions about the Iraq war that they themselves justified and watching them scramble for an answer that doesn\u2019t implicate themselves.",

I took 400 and 500 level classes that were a piece of cake, and some that required a decent bit of effort. You can usually get a feeling for what it'll be from the class description and professor reviews.\n\nAlso note that if you're coming from another school, AU grading will probably be much more lax and less intense than what you're used to.",

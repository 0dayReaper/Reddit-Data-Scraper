    "postText": "Hi, this is kind of a stupid question but I need help. I have a friend who got into AU and as a gift, I\u2019m going to send her a pair of the flip flops available online. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t figure out the sizing and the bookstore is temporarily closed so I can\u2019t call them for help. My friend has a shoe size of 7.5. The small pair of shoes is for sizes 5-7. The medium pair of shoes is 8-9. I\u2019m worried that anything that would fit a size 5 would be too small. And anything that would fit a size 9 would be too big. I was wondering if anyone has had experience with these shoes and knows if they run a little big or small. I know that I\u2019m totally overthinking this, but I want to get something closest to her shoe size so she can wear it if she wants but doesn\u2019t have to deal with returning it especially as she\u2018d have to pay for shipping on the return. Thanks so much in advance!",

Then the guy in front of her in line turned around and said that she looked familiar to him too! I chuckled and chalked it up to her having \"one of those faces\".

I get that it probably gets old- but fucking deal with it. i mean- it made her rich, right? Also- its not like she's Robin Williams or something for christ's sake. ",

    "postText": "AU is my top choice as a transfer student but I would be taking out ~33,000 in loans, not factoring in interest. i would be a journalism major and AU is my top choice because of its connections to foreign reporting and specific centers like the Center for Environmental Filmmaking, Center for Investigative Journalism, Center for Media &amp; Social Impact Classroom in the Wild, and foreign reporting + backpack reporting courses. I also like that the students are politically active but the campus is not smack dab next to the White House. After graduation I hope to go into either foreign reporting or paid political organizing. My other option is GW, where I'd be able to study abroad and pay half of what AU's tuition is, only 15k in debt, but the journalism program is a lot weaker there and I don't like the campus / student culture. Any advice is appreciated, thank you!",

            "comment": "As an AU grad.... go to GW.\n\nMost AU students move off-campus after Freshman year, as the AU dorms are practically as (if not more) expensive than living in a home or apartment near campus. Without living on campus, the only time you'll spend there is for class \u2013\u2013 so it's hardly worth comparing GW's campus to AU's.\n\nThe professors at AU are largely adjuncts \u2013\u2013 meaning they're professionals who work foremost within their industry, or teach part-time at a number of local schools (and only part-time at AU). A lot of my professors also taught at GW, Georgetown, and George Mason. There's a chance that the instructor in some of the courses you've named also teaches at GW \u2013\u2013 even if they don't offer the same exact classes, you may be able to work with your program advisor to complete an independent study, for credit, with that instructor \u2013\u2013 or even attend the specific class on AU's campus. I would reach out to your point of contact within the journalism department to see if this is possible.\n\nRE the student body: as some other users have mentioned, AU students tend to come in two types: really hardworking, politically-minded kids who attend on a scholarship.... and super rich kids who don't care about their education. Obviously not everyone will fall into these two buckets, but it's worth mentioning, as you likely have only met AU's 'Wonk'-type students (the ones who lead campus tours, etc.), and not their douchier compatriots. I know that when I attended, a lot of students resented the rich prep-school &amp; international kids.\n\nFinally \u2013\u2013 $65k is a lot of debt to assume, especially considering that entry-level journalism (and political lobbying jobs) in DC typically start at around $32k. I would not recommend putting yourself in such an uncomfortable financial situation while pursuing a job where your future income will be significantly less than the debt you take on.",

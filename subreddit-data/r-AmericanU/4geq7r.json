So far one alum has said they are so glad they did the JD/MBA, and one random person who didn't even go there told me not to do the dual degree at all...",

I thought this might be more economical of course than doing them seperatly (which I would probably never do if I don't do them at the same time).  \nAlso curious about why you feel SIS is better than WCL? The students? Profs? Program? or networking?    \nthanks for the info!",

I don't want to get too much into a law school rant, but i felt the quality of the overall program and atmosphere among students was much better",

I have visited campus and just did the admitted students day for WCL but obviously the students you interact at those are ones who are loving their classes and very happy with their decision. I'd rather get the good, bad and ugly!",

I am not sure his future plans but I would imagine having the network of SIS at your disposal on top of WCL's would be a huge asset. I'd say if you have the interest and the ability to fund it, it will only help you get jobs (if you're interested in international law type stuff... if not don't bother).",

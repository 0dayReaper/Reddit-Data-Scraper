The online textbook was pretty easy to understand, but lots of assignments were due online and it was extremely easy to find those answers. I didn\u2019t find the courses exceptionally rigorous but I didn\u2019t put much effort into it either as I took arabic to knock out the 4 semesters of foreign languages for my SIS requirement",

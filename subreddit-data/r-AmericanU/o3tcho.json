    "postText": "Hi guys!! Incoming freshman here. If I have AP calc credits, do I take MATH-222 instead of MATH-221? Also, anyone know what classes I take if I am majoring in econ, but have 5s in both ap macro and micro? I am so so confused, and the webinars were not at all helpful lol.",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t think they changed the math requirement from when I was admitted, so you can take any math class you want regardless of the AP you took. Some students just take the easiest math course to fulfill the requirement if they\u2019re major or minor doesn\u2019t require a specific math course. I think everyone has to take a math course even if you took an AP, so your calc class will just count as a part of the total 120 you need to graduate.  \n\nAs for course questions, AU gives the major requirements online so you can pick your courses from there. AP tests can count towards your major and electives, so you shouldn\u2019t have to take macro or micro. \n\nAlso, the webinars tend to just be fluff info and you can usually find the answer to your question on AU\u2019s website just by googling something like \u201cAmerican university AP\u201d (I used that my whole time at AU and it always worked)",

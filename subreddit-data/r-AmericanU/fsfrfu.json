Also, because I can't visit (for obvious reasons), any insight to the dorms/campus life/classes would also be super helpful. I'm planning to be a CS major if that helps. Thanks!",

Also keep in mind that CS opens the door for relatively lucrative careers, so while you should obviously still factor in cost, you can feel more comfortable overlooking small price differences if you expect it to lead to better returns on your investment.\n\nAnother factor to consider is whether or not you want a more of a liberal arts education or an engineering education. In a liberal arts education, you are required to take a number of classes outside of your major, your major only makes up around half of your classes, and it is easier to double major or add a minor. In an engineering education, you are generally required to take a broad sample of science courses, but with few (if any) requirements in the humanities or social sciences, most of your courses are related to your major, and it is more difficult to double major or minor. Both styles have their advantages and both are common in CS, and which one is best for you is up to personal preference. Are you dead-set on CS and only want to take STEM classes, or do you want exposure to a variety of subjects?\n\nThe reason I bring this up is because AU's CS degree very much follows the liberal arts model, whereas many other schools follow the engineering model. Some schools offer options similar to both. I don't know what the CS programs are like at those other schools you've mentioned, but this is something to consider as you look.",

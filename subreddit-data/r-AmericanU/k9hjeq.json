    "postText": "So a little about me, I\u2019m a queer liberal atheist girl living with extremely conservative homophobic Chadian parents. (They don\u2019t know I\u2019m not conservative/homophobic/Christian) I would love to go to a liberal university but my parents are very against it and are making me go to a Christian school. I know AU is technically Christian but they think it isn\u2019t Christian enough. I told them I would join republican clubs and Christian organizations. Is there anything else I can say to appeal to them? I know AU is very liberal but is there something I could tell them to make them at least consider? They are worried I\u2019ll go off to college and be negatively influenced and stop being Christian or thst people will give me a hard time for being Christian. They are also worried I\u2019ll become a democrat since I\u2019ll be surrounded by then. Any advice is appreciated! Thanks!",

Talk to them about how great it would be to be able to intern at the \\[insert christian superpac here\\] while you study here. Maybe focus less on AU and more on the benefits of going to school in DC. Good luck! It sounds like you would be a great fit at AU, and meet many great people.",

I have AU friends who've interned at the Heritage Foundation, AEI, and dozens of house and senate Republican offices, as well as GOP lobbyists, Fox News, and other conservative special interests. Opportunities to work with interests grow on trees as a student in DC. (I'm embellishing here to help you).\n\nYou might mention that AU Republicans is the 2nd largest club on campus (AU Democrats is 1st, but that's not important right now \ud83d\ude05), and that Ted Cruz received AU's highest honor just two years ago. \n\nYou also might find a reason to throw in there that the gorgeous Washington National Cathedral is just a 10 minute walk from campus, placing AU in the heart of a safe and affluent Christian community in DC (Now the Christian community part is kind of BS \u2014 AU is in a diverse community with a Synagogue, Buddhist Center, and a Mosque nearby \u2014 and that's just religious diversity, but it's hard to dispute your claim when you said that AU is right next to the cathedral). Even if AU doesn't require us to take religious classes, there are still many opportunities you can take advantage of to get involved in the churches nearby. \n\n*Sure, there may be some articles that they're finding online about how AU is \"one of the most liberal schools in the country,\" but you're really going here to look past all that and build a large Republican network in DC. After all, AU is a Christian university that's just steps away from the Washington National Cathedral in the heart of an affluent Christian community \u2014 one of the safest neighborhoods in DC, where students live amongst republican leaders and are regularly recruited to work with the GOP while completing their degrees.* (Did they buy my sarcasm?)\n\nBest of luck and I hope that you find your way here!",

I actually learned that when I went to the admissions event before I applied and I asked \"How would you describe the political culture on-campus?\" and the admissions officer pointed out that AU Republicans is actually the 2nd largest student organization on campus, preceeded by AU Democrats, the largest organization on campus. Her point wasn't that AU is a Republican school, but just that there is political diversity here, perhaps more than meets the eye. Quite frankly, I wasn't in either of these organizations, but it's still difficult to believe that AU Republicans is that big. I believe that Wine &amp; Cheese Club and Student Government are close contenders. \n\nIf you want to avoid the question *\"If AU Republicans is the second largest organization, then what's the first?\"* then you could just say that *\"AU Republicans is apparently one of the largest student organizations on-campus, and [you] believe that AU's Wine &amp; Cheese Club and Student Government are close contenders. And also, the Chi Alpha Christian organization is apparently popular, so you wouldn't feel out of place to be a conservative Christian here.\"* \n\nOoh one other thing: AU is literally next door to the Wesley Theological Seminary on Massachusetts Avenue. So unlike George Washington, Georgetown, Howard, and Catholic, AU is in a quieter, safer, affluent, and more conservative, part of town, literally right next to a School of Theology where they train priests. \n\nJust to make sure that we're on the same page in case it wasn't perfectly clear on both of these posts, AU is a predominantly liberal and very LGBT-friendly university, and I'm an Andrew Yang supporting gay person myself. I'm just trying to frame things a certain way to give you some ammo to convince your parents otherwise. \ud83d\ude09",

I do have friends who've interned at all those places and many others, but it's completely normal to not have had an internship at your point. \n\nIt's rough out there in the job markets right now so I wouldn't feel too discouraged. My first internship was at Senate Majority PAC the summer before junior year. I also applied to hundreds of internships and had no luck, then this PAC reached out and I settled for that opportunity. My next internship was at the World Bank (with other offers from the WH and Fortune 500s), and I'm not sharing that to brag... Just to say that my first internship wasn't really what I wanted to be doing, but it allowed me to put the word \"Intern\" on my resume, and that simple change opened up doors for me to do what I wanted. It's okay to take a first internship at that unsexy firm that won't lead to a full-time job \u2014 just to put the word intern on your resume and do some typical intern things, because you'll greatly increase your chances of finding a sexier internship opportunity the semester thereafter. \n\nHave you been working with an advisor in the career center? Likewise, if you ever want some feedback on your resume or something, I'd be happy to give it a look and give some thoughts.

They also have their own site if you need evidence. Being a very political school, even college repubs are active, so that's definitely a bent worth mentioning. \n\nHope that helps.

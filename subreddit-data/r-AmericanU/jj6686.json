It's one of the most liberal schools in the country and queers and allies is one of the biggest clubs on campus. People call the school Gay Jew instead of AU. It's definitely LGBT friendly.",

As far as I can tell, it has no impact on how the school is run, or the culture. Religion in general isn't a particularly big part of the culture: there are a lot of people from Jewish families, but it's a pretty lowkey presence in terms of actual religious practice, and overall a lot of tolerance for any religion. Like the other person said, AU is a very liberal school with a large population of queer people and allies.",

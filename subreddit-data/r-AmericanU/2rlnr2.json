    "postText": "Hi, newb freshman here. I am enrolled for a college writing class and I am second on the waitlist. I have never been on the waitlist for a class and am unsure of what the process is like? When do I know if I am actually in the class? What to do if I don't get in? If I'm second on the list what are my odds of getting on the roster?\nMany thanks to any responses.",

            "comment": "Odds are pretty good but it's always best to have a backup plan just in case. Since the first two weeks are add/drop a lot of people will be switching their schedules around, getting off wait lists for classes they really want, deciding they'd rather put certain classes off until other semesters, or that they want to take all their classes over the course of three days so they have two days off every week. Don't sweat the wait list too much, you've got 3 years left to finish all your requirements. \n\nIf you get off the wait list the reistrar's office will send you an email, then all you have to do is go back into your portal and register for that class before the start of the next day (I forget the exact time, but I think it's before 8am).\n\nIf you don't get off the wait list you have a few options. 1- take the class another semester. 2- sign up for a different open section. 3- talk to the professor and see if there is extra room in the class and if the class limit can be expanded. I'd caution against the latter unless you desperately need the class since a lot of professors prefer not to go over their limits. If you desperately need to take that particular section of the class, my best advice would be to email the prof a few days before classes start and explain why you really desperately need to be in their class. (Again, I'd really only do this if you're about to graduate and it's a required course.) Then, if the prof okays it, go to the class as if you're on the roster. If at the end of add/drop you're still not off the wait list, the prof can fill out a special form with the registrar and have you placed in the class. \n\nSauce: I graduated AU last May and had to do a lot of schedule juggling. \n\nHope that helps! Really, try not to worry too much. Only worry when you're on the wait list for \"Indiana Jones in History\" or one of those other awesome classes.",

My advisor said its not a huge deal if I don't make it within the first 30 credits but I just hate having to deal with administrative issues (like stops on my account). Hopefully it will all work out!",

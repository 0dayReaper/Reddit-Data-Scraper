Both sides still feel like they can win, and it is only one when side is soundly and thoroughly trounced that the other side can begin to dictate terms. Because we don't want Russia to win, I think we should continue to supply Ukraine with enough arms so that they can soundly and thoroughly trounce the Russians. As Biden likes to say, nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.",

Their use of violence is the only thing that will save their country from Russian onslaught. \n\nThe Ukrainians are more than willing to fight for their homeland, they don't need any encouragement from us.",

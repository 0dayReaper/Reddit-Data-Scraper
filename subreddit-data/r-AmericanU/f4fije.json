This isn\u2019t necessary however you will learn how to use those applications so it\u2019s a personal preference of if you want to use your laptop or the school desktops which have the proper applications preloaded.",

You'll probably want something 14\" or smaller since bigger displays chew up battery life and are just heavier compared to laptops with smaller screens.\n\nWhat I would do- look for a $250ish laptop with a small screen size to do work outside your home and spend some money to buy a second monitor you can plug into to do work at home. Refurbished laptops with higher specs, like an 6th or 7th gen i5 with at least 8GB of ram would be ideal.\n\nEdit: if you're just looking for straight links to Amazon or whatever so you can just buy the laptop, let me know and I can look around. I dont want to do work tonight.",

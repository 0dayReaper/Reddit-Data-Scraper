I was in between sophomore/junior standing when I started which may have been part of it but ASAC is actually really helpful with dorm accommodations. Also if you're concerned about being a Spring transfer, literally a month before we got kicked out because of the pandemic I requested to switch rooms within the building because of some roommate issues and my request was granted, so I wouldn't worry too much about whether there will be space. Since it's an upperclassmen dorm there are seniors that graduate in December too! Feel free to PM me if you have any other questions, I'd be happy to answer them :)",

I am looking for a great university experience alongside the academics of course, so would AU be able to provide that? \n\nYeah I know about DC Connections and how highly ranked SIS is but how is actually attending there? Are you guys happy with your choice? If not, why? Are there any other better schools for IR with a happier student body?",

It\u2019s ok, definitely expensive, but the support you get from professors is usually good, and the secondary support like counselors is always alert, if nothing else. The highlight is definitely the night classes, they have adjunct professors who work during the day. Those are always the most interesting.",

AU is notorious for loud whiners from NY/NJ.  Do your best so you can keep your options open if you want to transfer and for grad school.  Look at it as an investment not a glorified summer camp.",

            "comment": "The problem with SIS with a lot of people is many-fold. My problem with it was that it seemed like a bullshit major, mostly meant to entice foreign students with extremely high tuitions. You learn very few skills in an SIS major. If you are set on politics, going the political science route, or anything in the School of Public Affairs, is probably better. If you are set on working in international affairs, try to learn a skill that their looking, like computer science, or major in an interesting language.\n\nAU in general is a great school though. I\u2019ve enjoyed it socially since I came here. I\u2019ve especially enjoyed it since I switched majors to neuroscience though, as I feel like I have much nicer professors and much more interesting content. Idk tho. A lot of people find SIS hard also. But you\u2019re right, for one reason or another, many people don\u2019t like SIS. Still, some people are still happy in it, and if you\u2019re looking for a chill major, SIS would be good.",

            "comment": "I'm a rising senior in the SIS. It depends on what you're looking for. If your primary focus is the program and professors, hands down I would choose AU again. The professors are really good at what they do and are very connected to the IR world. Most of the professors I have had for instance had field work as researchers and are wildly published. When it comes to the student life, it's mixed. AU is not exactly the center of the DC college scene. Most of freshman year for instance I would be going downtown to the other schools events, not the other way around. That being said, AU never really feels isolated and there are always alot of stuff to do. What is really bad about AU is the administration, and that's where I think most of the criticism comes from in the first place. Our schools president and administration always seems poorly run. During Covid for instance, our school basically would give us information just days in advance. The school seems to constantly be raising prices and spending money, yet when you get to class all the chairs are broken. AU is not a bad school by any academic standard, and im quite satisfied with the educational opportunities I've had here, but the school itself feels poorly run, so you'll get that top notch education while living in a rat infested dorm room (that being said DC has a massive rat population in general so that part isnt all AUs fault but that doesn't mean you wont see them).",

My classes and professors have been great. \n\nAt the end of the day what program calls to u is what should determine ur school (along with if u can afford it).  \n\nI know Ira hard but don't get too caught up in the dc U HAVE TO NETWORK  culture. Don't get me wrong, connections are important but also remember to have fun in life lol.",

                            "comment": "That\u2019s valid. AU students do tend to be more aware and opinionated on all things political or happening in the world. That is also DC too (lived there for a decade). It\u2019s the capital of the US so there are lots of AU type of folks around that area. If you are a busy HS student\u2026my opinion is you\u2019ll be around other busy students at AU. Your conservative nature is more than fine at AU/DC. You just need to be aware there are a lot more students at AU that would push back or have strong opinions if you choose to engage in those discussions. That isn\u2019t a bad thing IMO. Just something to be aware of.",

While Kogod is known to be the most conservative out of all the schools, you will literally be ostracized because of your political beliefs. I\u2019m a democrat and even I feel like I don\u2019t belong a lot of the time. Everyone here is just annoying tbh.",

You may be challenged in your beliefs and ideologies\u2026what\u2019s what is college and life for if you\u2019re not?",

People are very liberally expressive and there is definitely a lot of diversity on campus. If you are conservative at all I would not touch the school.",

You will have to find other studying arrangements if you live in a triple.\n\nGranted, one of my roommates was very messy, so his stuff often took up more space. But three people is a lot for one of the rooms.",

I do believe that schools like AU pumping $$$ into housing and dining to attract more students is part of the feedback loop of skyrocketing higher education costs, but a triple in LA was definitely not worth the cost we paid per semester of housing.",

            "comment": "I trippled in Letts back in the day (2012) - the room across from the boys bathroom (3 girls, 2 of us named Rebecca).\n\nOne scenario is that you all become buds and everything is awesome always. Not likely.\n\nSecond scenario - everyone hates each other - put in a transfer request.\n\nMost likely, and my personal favorite based on experience, comfortable strangers! It worked for us - be respectful, do a group thing 1 or 2 times in the beginning, but keep your heads down and don't invite people to spend the night often and just be courteous of each others class schedules.\n\nTry not to all hate each other - drama at a MINIMUM. That's a large closet split 3 ways, it gets testy. Set a mutual agreement that no one person plays music or watches tv or does anything to contribute noise - everyone wears headphones unless we're all getting ready to go out on the same night kinda deal.\n\nMake sure they don't have friends over, and don't bring your possie to the room either. Your room cannot be \"the spot\" for 3 people and their friend groups, so the only fair thing to do is make it NO ONES spot or designated hangout, or else people get disrespectful really quick. No coming back to the room super loud and trashed in the middle of the night. No TV - unless you all dig ALL of the same shows. \n\nIt's a consensus dynamic, and all or none works best so nobody gets ganged up on or sides takes blahblahblah\n\nGood luck. My 1 year was manageable, but I haven't spoken to either roommate since. But we avoided a lot of the roommate drama that awaits the rest of your floor.\n\nOh, you definitely want to be the first one there to stake claim to your bed and move the furniture around so you can pretend it was like that when you got there (yes, I did this and it was never changed)\n\nI like the bottom bunk, because I hung blankets all around the sides and made an enclosed space - my own little bunk fort. Great for privacy and sleeping during the day - so long as the roomie above you isnt having their SO stay over (see aforementioned suggestion about that not being a thing)\n\n\\#",

I had the lofted bed so my desk was underneath it which was kinda nice, since I had my own space, but I almost always went to Katzen or the study lounge to study or do readings. Detripling was one of the best things to happen to me",

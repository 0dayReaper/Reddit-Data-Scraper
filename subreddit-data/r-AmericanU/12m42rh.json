            "comment": "you should be worried. if failing a class as a senior may lead to you being unable to graduate on time, your admission will likely be rescinded. reach out to your high school teacher and tell them that you are very concerned and realize your mistake and would like to work as hard as possible to not fail the class and get a C. Tell them that you'll do anything, and DO EVERYTHING they say. The habit of \"giving up\" in a class is unacceptable in universities, and would lead to other schools also possibly refusing to admit you. It's still April, most high schools don't graduate until may or june. get back to work. imagine the shame you'd face from your family if you fail and get kicked out of college before you even start.",

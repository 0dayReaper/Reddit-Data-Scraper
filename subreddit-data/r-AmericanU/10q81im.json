    "postText": "Hi. I am about to finish bachelor degree in international relations and I plan on applying to American University for graduate school but I need a little help. For the essay questions, I am not exactly sure what the third prompt \"At SIS/AU, the mission to inclusive excellence remains at the forefront of our daily work. How do you envision yourself contributing to a more inclusive workplace in grad school and in your future career?\" means?",

            "comment": "Really depends on the class. I think any non-ancient laptop running a mainstream operating system will be fine though.\n\nThe two-class intro sequence currently uses [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) in CSC-148 (Python) and [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) in CSC-208 (Java). They both have Windows, Mac, and Linux versions, and should run on any laptop with a few gigabytes of RAM. The main thing I'd avoid is something running a more niche or mobile OS, like a Chromebook or an iPad Pro, at least as your only computer.\n\nA few classes have been experimenting with cloud-based IDEs like [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and [repl.it](https://replit.com/), especially during covid. In upper-level classes, it's also common to let you choose whatever IDE or code editor you want.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI really need some help/feedback on housing options for graduate students off-campus. I am an international student, so I will be unfamiliar with the area and only plan to come to the US around August. My budget is no more than $1400, I would prefer a studio apartment (living on my own for now) and close to campus(walking distance preferable). I was looking at Berkshire apartments, which seemed to be reasonably priced, however I've seen several negative comments about the apartments there. Is it really that bad? Also, I've looked at the Eaves Tunlaw Gardens, Idaho Terrace and also listings on craigslist. Since I'm not able to go viewing apartments I'm relying heavily on the internet to help me with this search. Please if anyone can offer me some additional suggestions, I would really appreciate it!!! Thank you!",

They're pretty run-of-the-mill and lots and lots of students live there. Nearby the Berks is the Greenbriar and The Avalon. I am not too familiar with these, but I know The Avalon is supposed to be very nice.",

You should keep an eye on Craigslist, there are a lot of basement studio rentals in the neighborhoods surrounding AU that can be a good deal if you can catch them. [AU even has a little off campus-housing tool you can use](http://www.american.edu/ocl/housing/Off-Campus-Housing-Resources.cfm) though I haven't used it in years so I can't vouch for how active it still is.",

            "comment": "Your budget may be tight for living by yourself, especially in NW DC near Tenleytown. To be honest a lot of students live together in apartments or houses for rent. I am an economics graduate student at AU and I live in Columbia Heights in a studio. Definitely not walking distance, but there is a bus that goes straight to the Tenley metro. However, my studio is 1425 including utilities and some parts of Columbia Heights are still not as expensive as Tenleytown.  Craigslist is probably your best option, I would also check out /r/DCforrent . ",

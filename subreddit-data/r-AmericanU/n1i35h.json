            "comment": "AU junior here, personally I would recommend Centennial due to that shared bathroom. While it\u2019s a subjective thing, the shared bathroom allows for more privacy and cleanliness. Also, having the shared bathroom leads to more opportunities for friends, as you\u2019ll run into the inhabitants of the other room a lot. From what I\u2019ve seen and heard, the  dorms are just standard freshman dorms without that much difference. Although Letts is without a doubt the worst.\n\nFinding a roommate: \nI\u2019m pretty sure you can message people through your housing portal but I\u2019m not sure as I\u2019ve never done that before. I\u2019ve always liked rolling the dice and seeing who I got but I understand how that may not seem appealing. Reaching out to other students through the portal would probably be the best bet.",

                            "comment": "Well Letts has a reputation for being run-down, older, and sometimes gets the occasional rat infestation. The other dorms, especially centennial, are newer or have been updated. Although I\u2019ve only been the Letts a handful of times and it\u2019s possible they\u2019ve done work to it but I\u2019m not sure. Thankfully sophomore-upperclassmen dorms are honestly all fantastic so you won\u2019t have to worry about this come that time.",

            "comment": "If your looking for an interesting dorm and you like sports, I strongly suggest Centennial.  Not only are the people friendly, but also the mice. These aren't your typical mice, these mice are part of the only D1 ranked athletics program at AU.  Don't leave any food out because they can easily crawl under your dorm and chow down. Don't even think about cornering them cuz they're too fast. Now if you want to live like a real rodent, I suggest Leonard Hall.  Jokes aside, East Campus is the best option as it's new construction and very nice.",

    "postText": "Hey! So, let me tell you a little bit about my situation. I'm a 22 years old Swedish guy who was supposed to go on exchange and attend your university for the fall 2020 semester. That being said,  due to the uncertain circumstances, I decided to defer to spring 2021 hoping that things would take a turn for the better. And here we are... \n\nI'm currently debating whether it would be worth to put in the money/time/energy and spend a semester in D.C. Because of this I'd like to ask you guys directly. How's the situation in D.C. generally and more specifically AU? Are there any on campus/off campus activities/events? Would it be possible to meet and interact with people or is everyone rather locked up in their dorms? \n\nGiven your firsthand experience of the situation in D.C. and AU, what's your assessment o my case? It's worth mentioning that spring 2021 is my final semester and then I'm done with my bachelors degree. Thus, this might very well be the last and only opportunity I've to pursue my longtime dream of studying abroad..\n\nThank you in advance!",

DC is a gorgeous city, but very very few of your classes will even be hybrid (or none of your classes, if you're not in the sciences), meaning you will be fully online. That, and DC is still relatively shut down - the social experience you would normally get from an exchange will be stripped away. It's a great dream to study abroad, but that money could be better spent on a bit of travel after you graduate instead. Independent travel can teach you a lot more than any school programme, anyway. \n\n(also, I did study abroad as an undergraduate but then traveled for a year before starting my master's. the full year of traveling solo cost less than my 4 month exchange programme, even though I had a tuition scholarship)",

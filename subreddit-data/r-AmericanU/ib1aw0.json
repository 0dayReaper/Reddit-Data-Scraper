Unless you are a high achiever and AU is one of your safety schools, in which case it might be better not to do it. It might seem counterintuitive, but its actually better to feign disinterest in a school if you are confident you can get in, as it will make the school more likely to offer you more money to try to get you to come. If they believe AU is your #1 school, they usually won't offer as much money because they think you'd probably come regardless of price.    \n\n\nTo summarize: If you want to increase your chances of getting in, do it 100%. If you have plenty of other options and just want to see if you could get a good deal at AU, don't do it.",

I mostly padded it with why I want to be in but also touched on how going to AU was a cherry on top. \n\nTbh imo even if not required, full applications show the reviewer/officer that you care about the school more than someone that doesnt fill it out all the way.",

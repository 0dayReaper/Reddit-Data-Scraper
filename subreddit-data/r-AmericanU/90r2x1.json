    "postText": "I\u2019m going to be attending AU this fall, and would like to set up a bank account so I can deposit the roughly $700 of savings I\u2019ve gotten from my summer job. Which banks are the best and most convenient for students with little money at AU? I\u2019m looking for something with simple digital accessibility, and no low balance fees. Which banks have worked best for all of you?",

Everything is paperless but the app and website work well. \n\nI would stay away from Bank of America because the minimum balance is ridiculously high. ",

I\u2019m coming out of a relationship of 8 months, and I\u2019m just curious what dating in DC entails? I\u2019m not really into purely physical relations with people; I need an emotional connection as well. Is this rare? ",

Anywhere here is great for that. \n\nOn your second point, people definitely value social networking so much more here. So the quest for \u201cpower couple status\u201d very much influences the kind of relationships people are looking for.",

I specifically mentioned GU and GW because my social network at AU included a lot of GU and GW students. \n\nThe social climbing/status element used to really bother me (especially when I was on Tinder lol), but I think it\u2019s generally pretty avoidable.",

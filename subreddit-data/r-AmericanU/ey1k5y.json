    "postText": "Does anyone have thoughts or experiences on attending the Masters in Taxation program American University? I'm a Canadian who will be moving to the US for personal reasons and had worked in Transfer Pricing in a Big 4 firm outside of US for several years. I want to 1) transition out of TP but still work in tax and 2) also find work after the relocation. \n\nI like the DC location and the program content of American University (exposures to IRS and related agencies, more courses on tax research, has a tax policy centre at the university), butcan't find information on what companies recruit at American University's MAC or MST program and this is my main worry. Does anyone have experience with these programs, and especially job placement outcomes? Could anyone share experiences of attending these programs and how helpful they were in your career and work search? I don't have any prior work connections to DC or anywhere in US so a strong campus recruiting program is essential.",

            "comment": "I graduated with a masters of accounting from AU, so I can speak to this. The job placement for accounting and tax is really good as there's always work in those fields. Of the Big 4 firms, all but Deloitte come to campus when I was there, but I think even they are coming now. On top of that, all of the mid-sized and smaller firms in the area recruit either at events the career center puts on or through the university-specific job site. So I would wholly recommend the MST as it's a great program from my understanding, and the faculty around the program are really interesting people. \n\nThe trick for your situation is going to be your international student status. Most companies are hesitant to hire international students, but if you happen to also have US citizenship, the experience will be easier. You do have great work experience already, so maybe that will help. The problem is always going to be when the employer has to hire since they need to apply for an H-1b visa for the employment. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions about all this. I really did enjoy my accounting program and would love to see more join, but the nature of domestic vs international hiring should be mentioned.\n\nEdit: looks like Canadians have access to a special visa that makes the hiring process much easier. OP, if you're interested in DC and tax, I say go for it. Good program and good opportunities in DC.",

Apparently it's a far less burdensome process for employers to apply for, so I'll edit my comment above to reflect that. There really are so many jobs in accounting and tax specifically that with the easier visa requirements should make AU a good fit for the OP.\n\nThank you for pointing that out! TIL.",

So far the people I know in my cohort have offers from Big 4 (including myself) and regional firms. There are also plenty of opportunities to do research with the Tax Policy Center if you want to focus on taxation. If you have any questions, please feel free to PM me.",

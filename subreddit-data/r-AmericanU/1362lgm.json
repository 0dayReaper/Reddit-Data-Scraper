I have already put the deposit down, but I am seriously considering this other school\u2026 is the creative writing track worth it? Thanks so much, and please excuse my tardiness.",

What are you trying to get out of your college experience? \n\nI think studying English or rhetoric might be adjacent to what you want to do while setting yourself up for success. But success is also relative. As a creative writer I imagine you could find a living, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be easy. The other question would be what you get from studying creative writing; there is an argument that it is an internal process and a degree might not help you much.\n\nUltimately it\u2019s your call. Just consider the path you want to lay for yourself, how much it costs versus prospects. Best of luck friend!",

One thing to consider it\u2019s more lit heavy with creative writing as a speciality so most of your classes will be general lit courses.",

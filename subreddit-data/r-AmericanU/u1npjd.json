Is it true that there\u2019s no school spirit, bad freshman experience and lack of campus events? Also I\u2019m a journalism major and I heard it\u2019s a waist of money if ur not PS or IR. I really felt at home when I visited there but all the online posts/ reviews of ppl that go there say it sucks.",

Amazing events in the DC area with lots and lots of opportunities with IR and PS. Like great connections, networking, and internships etc. \n\n But you probably should choose a cheaper school if you haven\u2019t fallen in love with American. It\u2019s so expensive that I\u2019ll be paying off my loans for decades.",

There's a lot of campus events if you know where to look and know what you want to do. When it comes to people saying it sucks: college sucks. It's hard, there's a lot of work, you're usually kinda broke and you're constantly stressed out. That's just college. There's nothing about AU that makes it worse here. Honestly, this is the least stressed I've been at a school. So... hope that helps",

AU has as much school spirit as other schools, and a lot of students were def showing spirit when our womens basketball team made NCAA this year. In terms of housing as long as you get Anderson (or if u paid for centennial) you\u2019ll be fine. The other halls are just a lil more depressing (i\u2019m living in letts rn and it could be worse ig). While the vast majority of students here are SIS/SPA, there\u2019s quite a lot of opportunities for journalism majors with all the major news networks having locations in the DC area. Now i don\u2019t know much about the industry, but i\u2019d say there\u2019s definitely opportunity. In terms of campus events, there\u2019s several events on a weekly basis, in addition to the various clubs that do things often. The housing and food are a mixed bag, sure, but the education imo makes AU worth it. But if you\u2019re paying full price here then id start to question the value of an AU education.",

I would really evaluate the financial aid package you receive, whether you only want a BA, and if you\u2019re willing to pay $50k+ a year for connections and better access to internships because that\u2019s really what the appeal is.\n\nEdit: I wouldn\u2019t attend AU as an undergrad but I also have the experience of attending a big state school already. My top pick for undergrad was a small private college similar to AU, and I am actually glad I did not attend in hindsight.",

I\u2019m not 100% sure about gen eds since AU switched to a common core program and I know they don\u2019t accept AP classes towards common core",

I transferred in as a junior and as long as I take 17 credits each semester, I can still graduate on time. I pretty much stayed with the same major so that helped a lot. For the Habits of Mind, they don't look at the types of GenEd classes you're transferring in, just how many credits. For example, if you transfer in 45 credits, you have to take two HoM courses, if you transfer in 60 credits, you only have to take one.",

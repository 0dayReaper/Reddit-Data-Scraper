There are a lot of articles written about this that I'm sure you could find, but the short and skinny of it is that GW has been intentionally targetting the top students at AU for a few years now. They make transferring after the first year incredibly easy, which, in turn, leaves AU with fewer high-quality graduates. As a result, AU's rating has been tanking hard for many years. Odds are the school's rank will lower during your time in the program.",

The demographics look pretty good on paper.  \n\nOK.  But, really, how's the Black AU experience in 2021-2022?  I have a lot of specific questions, but I want to see where this goes.",

Like, I was the only black person in my class or maybe one of two. And people would stare a lot. \n\nThat being said a lot of the black orgs on campus are active and very friendly in my opinion. I think as a collective we recognize that we kinda have to stick together or be nice to eachother, at least most of us.\n\nIn terms of like day to day you might experience a lot of microaggressions and stuff and people who\u2019ve never interacted with black people. Or on the other hand people who try to show you how woke they are, both students and professors. I think that part kinda sucked, but I kinda learned to ignore it or confront it when necessary. I also think that\u2019s with most PWI\u2019s in general, but AU in particular has a lot of really well off kids.\n\nI think it also kinda prepares you for what you experience in the corporate world too of that\u2019s the path you wanna go on.\n\nI can also answer specific questions, but I may not be able to speak on everything.",

But yeah I\u2019ll echo everything you said. I think AU has done a better job of course correcting OVERT racism (you need only go as far as our Wikipedia page to see what examples there are), but I fully agree with your points about microaggressions and PWIs in general. \n\nI like to think the change is coming/happening but it\u2019s just coming very slowly.",

It\u2019s not their fault they\u2019re out of touch but it\u2019s definitely interesting. I grew up in DC and I had a VERY diverse experience middle-highschool so this was definitely a culture shock for me.",

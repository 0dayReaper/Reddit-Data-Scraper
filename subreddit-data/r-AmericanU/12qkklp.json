    "postText": "Hey everyone! I'm going to AU in the fall this year as a freshman, and I'm looking for a roommate / if someone has an empty bedroom they're wanting to rent out. I would want to have just fellow women roommate(s) as well. I would be able to pay up to about $1,000 per month (but hopefully less LOL), and I would prefer to live within a relatively close distance to AU, but I don't mind a commute. I'd like to think I'll be a chill roommate (definitely won't blast my music at 2am), so if you're looking for someone, don't hesitate to send me a message. \n\nAlso, if anyone has any advice for finding off campus housing that would be much appreciated as well. Thanks in advance! :)",

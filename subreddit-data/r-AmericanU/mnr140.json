Unfortunately my father has been off on disability for several months (9 to be exact) and we\u2019re waiting on a doctors letter to submit to the online AU appeals system. If I were to submit this on Monday, would it be too late ?",

The financial aid office was able to process my appeal when I submitted my materials through the link so I think u should be fine.",

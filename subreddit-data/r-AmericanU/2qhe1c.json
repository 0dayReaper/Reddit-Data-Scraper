Can anyone give me their perspective on the program? \n\nIf you don't know much about the EPGA program but can tell me about the faculty of the SIS and the CAS's Religion and Philosophy department, that would be great too!",

My apologies.\n\nMy undergrad was a double major in International Affairs with a concentration in Economics and Religious Studies at FSU. \n\nI hope to work within the academic community doing research and influencing policy for international ethics with a special interest in emerging technologies.\n\nFor example, the ethical implications of Google or Elon Musk developing an open internet accessible to people even against the will of an independent sovereign state via space stations or air balloons or what have you.\n\nOr perhaps someday it will be economically viable for companies to genetically \"enhance\" a low income foreign work force to get sick less and be able to perform more physically demanding tasks on less sleep. If the people choose to because they believe it is a better life than whatever their alternative is.. I'd like to research and write on the different perspectives and considerations at hand.\n\nBecause I would also like to teach, this would ideally be done at the university level with research funding. However, seeing the state of academia, I'd also be happy in a position with a nonprofit, intergovernmental organization, or the state department where I was performing this kind of research.\n\nEventually I would like to pursue a PhD as well.",

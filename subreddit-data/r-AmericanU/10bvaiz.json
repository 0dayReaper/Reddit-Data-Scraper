Its included im tuition and honestly makes exploring so much easier and cheaper.\n\n2. AU isn\u2019t as close to all the main DC stuff as its advertised. Everything monument wise is a couple metro stops away. \n\n3. International Relations major is actually called International Studies here and all the international studies major just say SIS (school of international service) since the SIS school only has one under grad major unless you are in the global sis program. \n\n4. Food sucks but there are a few good places\n\nFeel free to ask any more questions",

So even if its only 4 miles to get to it still takes like 35-45 min to get there. Plus the closest metro is in tenley town which is a 10-15 min walk from AU campus unless you take the AU bus then its like 8-10.",

            "comment": "I graduated from SIS fairly recently, a few things:\n\n* First, SIS is a great school, but AU doesn't have the same name recognition as Georgetown and other prestigious competitors, so you'll likely need to have ways to stand out in addition to your degree in order to get a return on your massive investment:\n   * I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to score internships while you're at AU. There's a million NGOs, think tanks, IGOs, embassies, consulting firms, etc. in the area, it might not be easy, but getting that experience in will be MASSIVE when you're actually out job hunting. As you get closer to junior/senior year, would highly recommend checking out the pathways internship program if you are interested in working for the federal government.\n   * Check out the Office of Merit Awards. Vastly underused and incredible resource. I can say, without exaggerating, that I would not be where I am without them. I did the Boren program, but there are various other great opportunities that the Office of Merit Awards can help you with.\n   * Go. To. Office. Hours. Not only do professors at SIS/Kogod tend to be genuinely nice people with some pretty great life stories, but your relationships with them will be the difference between boring recommendation letters and sincere, eye-catching ones. \n   * Take this time to get used to handling your own personal finances. Ramit Sethi's *I will teach you to be rich* is a great book to pick up at some point. Trust me, knowing how to handle your finances is more useful than 90% of the stuff you'll forget from class.\n* Second, you need to be proactive as far as managing your own education. Do your research and I guarantee you'll be able to skip quite a bit of useless crap. For example, there's a math placement test that isn't too hard to pass and will let you skip the math requirement altogether. If you did IB/AP, you should also be able to get out of a few electives or even core courses. Your advisor won't ever look out for you like you look out for you. And yes, if you have to go over their heads and write to the dean to get out of paying $X,XXX for a useless class, DO IT.\n* Third, IMO the real value in this degree is soft skills, no one cares what you've memorized in XX class, at best all that is a conversation piece. Problem-solving, presenting, teamwork, data gathering/presentation, research, WRITING. Ignore the dumb WRTG intro classes, the best way to learn to write in my experience is to read well-written stuff. If you learn to write and read one or two solid world history books, I guarantee you'll coast on A's at SIS without any sweat or tears.\n* Fourth, this is going to be more relevant to your senior year but look into the State Department Diplomacy Lab if it's still a thing when you get there. TRUST ME, best capstone course by miles.\n* Finally, if you want decent food, you have three options: 1) head down to Nebraska Ave and eat at Shemali's or (more expensive) Cheff Geoff's/Al Dente. 2) make the trek to Spring Valley shopping center on Mass Ave and eat at Millie's, Bluestone or Pizza Paraiso. 3) Head over to Tenley Town, lots of solid choices there.",

AU loves their study abroad program (especially for sis majors\u2014 pretty much all sis majors end up abroad) so you can do some research on those and talk about that. Talk about student life! You can say you have talked to students about the culture and the activities AU does throughout the year! Also talk about any clubs you\u2019d like to participate in. You can also mention how AU is the only school in dc that is partnered with WMATA and allows students to travel the city for free with the Upass\u2014 can connect to the job and internship opportunities by saying that it allows for a stress free and more money friendly opportunities that schools in the area cannot offer. \n\nThats just a few ideas! If you want more details or more ideas let me know!",

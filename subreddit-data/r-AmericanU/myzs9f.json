    "postText": "Hi! \nHow likely is the admissions office to change their mind on a decision? I might be getting two Cs this semester, but my weighted GPA won\u2019t vary that much in comparison to what I have had. How likely is it? I know i\u2019m probably just paranoid but it is a stressor for me rn. Thanks!",

            "comment": "It\u2019s a great program and is very well respected. We\u2019ve got a lot of real experts in the field, including some authors who really helped shape PA as a discipline. I\u2019m finishing the program now and I\u2019ve enjoyed every minute. Classes are great and they\u2019ve handled going online pretty well. Class options are also good, and there\u2019s a lot depending on what you want to go into. The social landscape is great, even in the pandemic I\u2019ve gotten to know so many great people in the program and had the opportunity to be a part of student orgs where I had great experiences. I didn\u2019t rely on AU/SPA for much professional development or anything, so that might suggest that it\u2019s weak but I really can\u2019t comment. Feel free to DM me if you wanted to learn more/have more specific Qs.",

            "comment": "I got in as well and am probably signing my acceptance letter today! It's been a nervewracking decision bc the cost of living in DC is so high but I think I've decided to go anyway bc the opportunities for internships will be unmatched. Everyone in the program has been super available to answer all my questions which I feel like is a good indication for their career center responsiveness and helpfulness. They have more electives for the MPA than the other programs I'm looking at as well. Good luck with your decision!",

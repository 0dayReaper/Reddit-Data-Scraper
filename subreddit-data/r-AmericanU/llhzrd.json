As far as the classes go, they\u2019re challenging but interesting and doable. Most classes are gonna expect that you participate orally which is the main difference I see compared to my undergrad classes. Congratulations on getting into the program! If you have any more questions you can PM me.",

It has its stresses, but it\u2019s designed for working professionals. Everyone in the program is very intelligent, ambitious, and well-rounded. The curriculum between online and in person is similar, with a few minor class differences. The only difference is on campus students make more intimate connections, not to mention being in dc. I was outside dc, but managed to get several contract research positions from Atlantic Media due to the connections and brand prestige from AU. I now work as a market research analyst in my hometown city focusing in emerging markets, which is exactly what I studied. Needless to say, LinkedIn is your best friend whether online or in person. If you leverage that, the network obtained through online will benefit you in the short and long run.",

I'm guessing our applications were very different though--government background, some overseas experience already. I suspect that letters of recommendation and the \"intent essay\" you write weigh quite a bit, as my admissions advisor remarked positively on mine. \n\nI think your prospects are probably better than you think though. I went back to check how long it took to get a response, and it took about 3 weeks to get a decision. I finalized my application on 3 Oct and got my decision on 30 Oct. Made for a happy Halloween during Coronapocalypse!\n\nGood luck!",

    "postText": "2007 alumnus here--\n\nWe are looking for men and women who want to play softball to join our small league.  You don't need experience, we slow pitch and don't have strikes, we play every week on the national mall and it is all government/nonprofit types.  There is no league fee.\n\nIf you will be in town from May through early August and would like to play, send me a message.  Feel free to contact me if you are on an existing team that would like to set up some games or even join our league.  ",

            "comment": "I can only speak about the Sustainability Management program. The biggest issue with the program is the lack of career support because the potential industries/jobs after graduation are more niche and above the capabilities of what Kogod has to offer. \n\nSo if you already have experience in the field and are using the degree to enhance your prospects already in it, then I would say it's a great program. If you are looking to switch careers and are using the degree to do that, expect to rely on your own connections and resources rather than the school.\n\nThe faculty for the MSSM program are really passionate and are great to know, but without career support many experience difficulty translating the degree afterwards. What are your plans for the degree if you don't mind sharing?",

I ended up with an accounting degree, which is basically the only Kogod degree that doesn't rely on career services for finding employment. \n\nIf you're interested with working in the south and using your connections there, the degree may still be a good fit. Interfacing with businesses seems to lend more to the MSSM than the SIS degree in my opinion. \n\nAnd who knows, you may find something in DC if you keep your ear to the ground, go to industry events, and network like anywhere else. DC has a lot of opportunities for that. You just have to be willing to branch out and calibrate what level of job you may get starting out in a new field. Do you have any prior consulting experience?",

However, I'm sure my political background is laughable in the DC area.  It's probably only impressive in the south.\n\nI do not want to stay in the south.  DC is our ticket out of here, and we have no intentions of coming back.\n\nI'm decent at networking, but I am doubtful I would stand out well enough in a place like DC or the surrounding area.

    "postText": "Hi everyone.  I will be applying to transfer from my community college in the upcoming weeks.  Seeing as how expensive applications are I can only apply to a few schools.  I will be a political science major and think it would be nice to study in the nation's capital for all the obvious benefits.  I have not taken the SAT and don't plan to so Georgetown is out of the question for me as they require it for transfers.  I am not interested in the Catholic University because I don't think it will help prepare me for law school as well as other schools could.  I have narrowed it down to applying to either GWU or AU.  I do not want to apply to both but rather one and am having a hard time picking which.  I like that GW is right smack dab in the middle of the city but I also see how AU's actual campus could provide me with a more traditional experience. I want to know more about the experience that the actual students have had. \n\nSo my question is, how do you like American University? Do you regret accepting your offer to attend over a different college? Any feedback is appreciated. Thanks!\n\n(I may also cross-post this to the GW subreddit as well)",

            "comment": "Hi!\n\nSo I'm currently a Junior at AU, studying political science and international relations, and I very much like it here. I had the option of going to GW or AU, and I've heard a lot about how being right in the middle of the city can be both great or frustrating, depending on the person. As far as AU specifically goes, its a tad expensive, and the administration can be difficult to work with (Although I don't feel like its any worse than any other school I've seen or have friends at) but especially if you're here for political science I'd absolutely say it's worth it.\n\nThe frats are here if you're into that, but not all-encompassing if you're not. If you want to do anything in DC, it's much easier than it might seem to just jump on the metro and head downtown. I know a few people who have gotten into great law schools with an AU degree, so no worries on that count, and I generally like the students here; just about everyone's friendly. Housing is nice whether you're on or off campus, and there are plenty of things to do on the weekends. By all means, PM me or reply here if you have any more specific questions!",

That's a big selling point for me to go to school in DC and I would really appreciate 1 or 2 internships in my two years that I will be there.  Also do you notice any GW vs AU rivalry when it comes to DC opportunities?",

Literally, 90% of AU students graduate having done at least 1 internship - that's an official statistic that the administration loves talking about. To me, there seem to be plenty of internships to go around for all the DC schools, and at least in the two offices I've worked in they seemed to regard GW and AU on equal footing as far as qualifications go. I feel like it depends more on your individual things on your resume rather than what school you're at.",

I'm majoring in Public Comm and minoring in Theatre, and I got an internship working at a theatre's PR dept. The real gem when it comes to internships though are your professors. There are so many of them who really really want to help you get an internship, and sometimes they'll ask you to intern for them. You can make really great connections through professors.",

I know incredible successes and miserable failures from both schools. It's all in how you play the game; utilize your time well at either institution, and you'll be fine.",

I paid for most of the absurdly high cost of tuition with student loans, and I left with nearly $100k of debt for a political science degree I could have received at most state schools for 1/3 - 1/2 of the cost (I came from community college as well). If you can afford the school and money is not an issue then I absolutely recommend it and the perks of going to AU and living in DC make sense. If you are going to need student loans, save your money and go to a state school. Especially if you have to pay for law school afterwards. If you do well at most state schools you can get into a great law school, and you'll have a much larger alumni network to work with after graduation. I personally made a bad choice in going to AU and I'll be (literally) paying for it for a long, long time.",

AU students have great opportunities that are very similar to GWU. However, you definitely get a more campus-y and \"normal\" college feel at AU than GWU in my opinion. Very metro and bus accessible and not an overly competitive school. Choosing AU was the best decision I made.",

Have you looked at UMD? Tuition is half the price, and the school is much bigger, which I consider to be a plus. It means a wider variety of classes, greater selection in professors, and a more diverse community.\n\nDespite being in College Park, UMD is just as much \"in DC\" as American is, which is to say from either campus you have to get on the metro to go do most DC-related stuff.\n\nAs for looking at schools that will set you up for law school, you're in luck! I'm an /r/lawschool moderator and rather well known for my work on law school employment statistics. American will not really prepare you any better than Catholic, which is to say undergrad tends to do nothing to prepare you for law school. Admissions will be based almost entirely on your GPA and LSAT scores, and your undergrad school won't matter unless it's super elite like Yale. Feel free to ask if you have any specific questions about law school, but right now you really should be focused on (1) having a great undergrad experience, and (2) exploring other career paths, because you may find out you absolutely hate legal practice.",

The only thing I'd recommend is a program where you can take some analytical philosophy classes, and preferably formal logic. Those will help a bunch on the LSAT.\n\nWhat you should be considering is the cost of undergrad if you're going to pile on $100,000-$250,000 more in law school loans. Also, think about the opportunity to intern or get part time work in the type of environment you'd like to be in after school.",

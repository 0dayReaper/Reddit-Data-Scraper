    "postText": "Hi everyone, I was accepted to the incoming SIS class at American and Ill be moving from Kansas City (woof) to DC this summer. Im looking into internships etc starting in May so I will be needing an apartment lined up fairly soon. I would like to plan the location around where classes are on the AU campus if necessary. Can anyone give me some direction in terms of where most of these classes are held/ popular student residences in the area? Thanks!",

            "comment": "I think AU offers on-campus summer housing for students interning, taking classes, etc, so maybe look into that. If not, it\u2019s a small enough campus that there isn\u2019t a major advantage to living near one building versus another, it\u2019s a difference of just a couple extra minutes of walking. So I\u2019d prioritize quality and cost over location to SIS in particular over other buildings on campus; unless you have an issue that makes walking difficult, I think the advantage is pretty negligible.\n\nThat all said, SIS is closer to New Mexico avenue, which has apartments like Sutton Place, the Towers, Cathedral Co-Op, something with Embassy in the name I believe, and a bunch of others in the area. A lot of students also live in the Berks and Avalon, which is around the corner on the other side of the quad (again, it\u2019s an extra 2 or so minutes). I\u2019d recommend looking into that area.",

Those two things are mostly how the \"roommate wanted\" gets passed around from my experience. \n\nAlso, in my opinion, Tenleytown is not lively enough to make it worth living in a different area and taking the metro/shuttle. My friend at SIS lived close to campus and then moved to a different area of DC not long after. \n\nI've lived in multiple places in Capitol Hill and I love it.",

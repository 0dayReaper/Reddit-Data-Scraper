    "postText": "I'm a prospective student currently in my senior year of high school and I'm looking into applying to the AU Honors or Scholars program. Can anyone who is a part of either elaborate on the differences between them beyond what is posted on the website? I applied to the school itself last Friday, but I ended up missing the \"priority deadline\" because I figured it would be better to submit good, coherent essays later than the usual one-nighter garbage. Will this negatively impact my chances of getting into a special program? Either way, my attendance at AU is likely contingent upon the amount of merit and need that they provide. Being that I expect to get a decent amount of need, is it still possible to get a generous package outside of the special programs? Thanks in advance!",

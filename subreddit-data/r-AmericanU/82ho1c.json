    "postText": "I'm a HS Junior looking at AU for Political Science and possibly business. I've noticed AU is at the ranks of 70 with an acceptance rate of 25%. In 2014 the acceptance rate was around 50% and was ranked in the 100's. There has obviously been a drastic change in the school, and I was wondering if the prestige of AU will also drastically change by 2023/4? \nAlso how known is the business school and their school for political science? I've noticed the business school has climbed ranking as well\nThanks",

They're private so they can afford to do it.\n\nIt's a game that many schools play. \n\nThese ranks are artificially manipulated. These purely mathematical formula do not consider or have any way to measure the value of education recieved.\n\nYou even noticed the correlation yourself\nI have two BAs and JD from AU. Don't let yourself be fooled by rankings. \n\nIt's primarily based on first year entrance students statistics compared to all the other schools. \n\nDon't go to poly science at a private school if it requires huge loans. Our BA in poly science BY ITSELF is worthless in the real world. You'll likely need post-BA education which will require debt in most cases. \n\nGood luck either way. ",

I'd say the education you get here is probably not as good as the rankings online say, but in the end a school's name and recognition can be more valuable than what you learn in class in terms of getting a job ",

As an international student any pay increases are going to affect people like me the most as we do not qualify for any type of financial aid and often get the worst scholarship packages. And don't give me the international students are rich excuse because that's simply not true. We often take out large loans in our own home country at high interest rates as it's the only option. While I think executive pay should be reduced I know it's not gonna happen. AU is a business and is gonna remain that way forever. So no I am not going to support a union that doesn't understand basic economics. They knew the pay when they accepted the job and if you don't like it then you're free to leave as simple as that.",

I don't see why I should be footing a bill for something that I do not support. I fail to see how front desk workers who do nothing but press a button, give students their packages and temp keys should be getting any raises. These are people who are literally getting paid to do their homework, watch YouTube or whatever they do at the desk. Plus the only way many international students can \"afford\" the 50k tuition is as I said taking a loan in their own country at high interest rates or emptying your entire family's savings. So yea I dont support these greedy unions getting a penny more and they can feel free to strike till they come back begging for their jobs back. Here's my olive branch to you. I wholeheartedly support wage increases across the board as well as high bonuses for all student workers, only after I graduate.",

While salaries are a huge piece of the overall AU budget, the top 10 salaries at the school make up a surprisingly substantial chunk. The pay raises for Sylvia Burwell over the past 4 years could raise the salary for 160 adjunct professors by $3,000 per 3-credit course (double the current pay without terminal degree and 75% for those with terminal degree). That would still make the adjunct pay less than Georgetown btw. They will probably raise tuition, but that is a choice by those at the top and shouldn\u2019t be blamed on workers trying to get fair compensation.",

If it helps, I have a scholarship and have still had to fight for every bit of FA I have gotten and had 17 credit  hours per semester with two part time jobs. Not trying to pull an old man walking uphill both ways gripe, but I think that fighting for workers and students go hand in hand. I have also worked outside of school for 10 years and have never received employer healthcare, benefits, or been able to join a union. Helping to fight for labor rights now helps you long term, unless you are able to join the bourgeoisie in which case it would hurt you. I wouldn\u2019t assume that everyone fighting for workers is leeching off their parents, or even that all students are.

I did two years at a community college and only transferred to AU with a substantial merit scholarship. 7 years scraping pennies would not come close to paying for 4 years at AU, so I think the decision making there is questionable. There are really great state schools that have lower tuition, and this is also a straw man argument. I dealt with financial aid this year when I had a deadfall and they helped me close it, which was a much more profitable hourly rate than $12.

After state and federal taxes, net pay was about $33,800. I saved about 90% of my post taxes paycheck because my parents were gracious enough to house me while I slaved away for a company that hated and abused me. Could I have gone to a relatively cheap state school? Yes. However an education is an investment in the future. I chose to spend more money on a top 100 nationwide school precisely because I never want to be a minimum wage slave working 60 hours a week and hating my life every second ever again.\nYou mentioned earlier about joining the bourgeoisie, yes absolutely I want to join the upper middle class or the upper class. They\u2019re living the good life. They can have what they want, when they want, and don\u2019t spend all day everyday hating everything. What\u2019s not to like? And since this is America, I intend to keep working hard to get there.\nAn education from AU is my ticket to the good life, it\u2019s why I came here, and I don\u2019t want to run out of steam when I\u2019m getting close to the finish line. I understand that this may be an \u201cunpopular\u201d opinion, but I worked hard too. Am I not entitled to anything myself from all the blood and sweat I\u2019ve shed?\nI stand by my statements, I\u2019ve worked hard, I know others have too. I know how hard the staff works, and they deserve better. However, improvements to their conditions should not come at my cost. As you mentioned, executive pay at AU has increased over the last several years at a rate that would pay over a hundred professors an extra $3,000 per class. There is room there for staffer pay increases, and if there is not, AU should take some of the money it invests into the market and redirect it to staff. If there isn\u2019t money there they should admit more students to make up the difference.\nAgain, I\u2019m not against increasing staffer conditions, but there are a variety of solutions that can be implemented prior to tuition increases. But because AU is a private school that operates for profit, I can already tell that these staffer pay increases will be used to justify higher tuition, because the university has no desire to lower their own bottom line.\nIt\u2019s just hopeless.",

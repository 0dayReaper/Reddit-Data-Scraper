    "postText": "I visited AU this past summer but I've been wondering about how the school is academically. I'm a prospective student thinking about applying to AU next year. How is the International Studies major at AU? I've heard it's really intense but also one of the best in the country. About student life, I've heard mixed things. Would anyone be willing to talk about their experience at AU? Whether or not you're an IS major. Thanks!",

Yes, some of them have spent their lives in academia, but in my experience the majority of professors I took classes with also had real-world knowledge and experience. I'm always blown away by how involved in our field our professors have and continue to be. Having access to and learning from experienced professionals with indispensable connections is not something many schools have.",

Did you ever take an internship while at AU? do you feel like the experience helped you at all? I'm looking at other schools outside of DC but I feel that DC has a big advantage with how relevant it is to something like International Studies, but I don't know how much. \nSecondly, how are debate teams or MUN at AU? Thanks again!",

Me as a freshman, I've already done my first one and it's super beneficial. Not only did it get me out in DC area, but it also got me contacting various embassies and going to their events. There are tons of International Studies internships around AU though that are relevant to the major and useful in life.\n\n\nBut as for your question about the debate team at AU, I am also a member of the AU Debate Society/debate team. We do Parli and placed 10th in the nation as a club and had the 17th top team in the nation.  At the same time, we don't have auditions but still succeed at a high level. We still go to tournaments all over the East Coast and it's all just fun!",

They hold tournaments every now and again, but they're never particularly well run and to be honest I wouldn't bother with them.\n\nIf you're looking for an academic team at AU, the Mock Trial team just had its best season in its 6 year history, coming in 4th place at the national championship.  They're a really great bunch and are well worth a look, even if you have no plans on going to law school or becoming a lawyer (I certainly don't).  If you're interested or have any more questions, feel free to hit me up in PM.",

You obviously have never been a major part of the debate team otherwise you would know that holding the tournaments isn't that big a part of AU Debate. Or that the tournament that was poorly run this year was because of technical issues that were fixed in the second one, which happened to be very well run. ",

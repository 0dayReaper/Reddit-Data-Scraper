            "comment": "AU is eh when it comes to weed. DC is great tho. It\u2019s got it\u2019s share of stoners (me included lol), but most people are generally open to or at least not overly put off by  weed. Definitely do NOT do anything on campus. Plenty of people get away with dabs in the dorms, but flower will attract attention, no matter how you try to hide it. I know people who have gotten screwed over big time, because while the students are generally chill, RAs and especially AUPD are not. They run AUs campus like a police state, are constantly watching, and significantly less chill than law enforcement on other campuses. AU won\u2019t expel you for your first weed offense but they\u2019ll do just about everything in their besides that. The 7 years thing that somebody mentioned is partly true. They hold your disciplinary record for 7 years, but you have to approve its release to any third party. Generally the only employers that will ask are federal govt or law enforcement.\n\nLiterally across the street on Rockwood Pl., right by the gate to the freshman dorms, is what people call \u201cthe freshman smoke spot\u201d. Basically anytime past 8pm there will be ppl smoking joints there, often in big groups. It\u2019s across the street from campus, but AUPD has no jurisdiction. MPDC doesn\u2019t care either, the one interaction I had with them there they told me that they \u201cdidn\u2019t care about the smoking, we just couldn\u2019t stand on the neighbor\u2019s lawn\u201d.\n\nDC, apart from AU, is a wild west in terms of weed. Congress prevents the district from establishing a regulated recreational market, so we\u2019re stuck with this weird \u201cgrey market\u201d. Basically anybody can \u201csell\u201d weed, entirely unregulated, as long as they don\u2019t actually sell it, but gift it to you alongside the purchase of something else. This has given rise to huge companies, running storefronts and delivery services, which will \u201cgift\u201d you whatever weed products you\u2019d like in exchange for the purchase of something tiny at a crazy high price (sometimes a sticker, lighter, etc). If you\u2019re open to getting a medical card, get one. Medical is regulated, safe, and quality, although the closest licensed dispensary is abt a 20 min drive from campus. Otherwise feel free to dm me and I can give you some info on the more reputable places in the city. Pls don\u2019t go to either of the shops in Tenleytown\u2026",

The [decriminalization law](https://mpdc.dc.gov/marijuana) makes it legal for someone 21 or older to possess up to 2 ounces for personal use. That said, the DC police also have a policy of not arresting under-21s unless it's over 2 ounces (the link has details).",

Under 21, it is written into the law that the police are to confiscate any weed products without official documentation. The intention is to prevent those who may be caught with weed underage, who tend to disproportionately be underserved minorities, from having a criminal record, or any sort of arrest, civil penalty, or anything.",

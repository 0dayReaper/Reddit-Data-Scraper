Went to Nicaragua with him and a class to the mackengue reserve. It was the best experience in my life and Tudge was a huge part of it.\n\nNever took his bio class though - this was a seperate thing. And there's no guarantee you'll get him but talking with your counselor and using the online class selecter you probably have a good chance. But  I think he used to only teach Sophomore's or older. That definitely could have changed in the past few years. \n\nGood luck. And don't be afraid to talk to teachers and counselors for help. That is probably my largest regret, not using the resources given to us.\n\nEdit: spelling - sorry had a rough day and am pretty tired so I kind of wrote like I was 4.",

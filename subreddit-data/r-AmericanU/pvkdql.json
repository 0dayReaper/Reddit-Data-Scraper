    "postText": "Hey there,\n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had recently received an HEERF (Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund) Award, and if anyone had any more info about what round we're actually in. For those who aren't aware, Congress has approved three different, and separate rounds of HEERF money/grants for universities across the country. \n\n**The** first one, called the CARES act, is widely known as HEERF I, and was passed in March of 2020. According to the AU website, the money (\\~$3.16m) the university received for CARES (HEERF I) has already been fully disbursed to the students.\n\n**Then**, in late-December of 2020, Congress passed CRRSAA (less syntactically appealing than 'CARES' ik), which is widely known as HEERF II. American once again received \\~$3.16m for the students to be given, and the website says that \"eligible students are considered and approved based on financial need.\" \n\n**Finally**, in March of 2021, Congress passed the ARP (American Rescue Plan), the most wide-sweeping bill yet, giving AU \\~$8.3m to the students. The AU HEERF site says, \"AU is in the process of identifying HEERF III eligible students and will be awarding eligible students throughout the Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 semesters until all funding has been expended.\"\n\n**Here's** my conundrum \u2014 I was approved and graciously given HEERF grant money to help pay for my tuition (for a number of personal \\[read: financial\\] factors), but under the Eagle Service financial aid section it is listed as a HEERF II CARES award. Which raises a couple questions: is this from the second round of funding, or the third, since supposedly AU was still in the process of finding candidates for HEERF III funding, and the second round had already been disbursed. I highly doubt it's actually apart of the *first* round of funding as \"CARES\" suggests in the award title, and the financial aid office is likely just lumping all HEERF money under the CARES umbrella (wrongly so). \n\nThis post is mostly to gauge other peoples' thoughts, and see if anyone else had any insight/had received HEERF money too! I'm happy to elaborate on any of my experiences with HEERF too if anyone wants to chat about it.",

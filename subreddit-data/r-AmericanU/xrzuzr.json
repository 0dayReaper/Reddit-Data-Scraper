    "postText": "Can you use AP Calc for one of your quant lit requirements? Or would the AP credit just be generic credit and I\u2019d still need 2 quant lit/math classes for core? Will AP Calc credit force me to take more calc or harder math for quant lit? Undecided major but for sure not stem or business def will not be wanting higher level math!! I know you need a 4 or 5 for credit, but my question is really if Calc AB credit is helpful for math core requirements at AU (some places yes, some no).",

You don't necessarily have to take a harder class though- I had AP Stats credit that counted for STAT-202 (but not the QL1 requirement) so I took STAT-160 because I didn't want to take an unnecessarily difficult math class, and that counted as my QL1.",

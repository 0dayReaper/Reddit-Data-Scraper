    "postText": "  Hi!\n\nA few weeks ago, I was admitted to the School of Public Affairs for the Public Administration master\u2019s program. While AU has always been my top choice for grad school, it is an expensive school. Quite a bit more expansive than the University of Delaware which has offered me a nice aid package. \n\nIf I haven't received an email regarding merit aid decisions/awards notifications, should I assume I just wasn't offered anything? I got my awarded offer from UDel just a week after I got admitted and they just updated it with more money. But I need to accept by April 15 so I don't know if I should wait for AU or not :( tonight's also the first info meetings about aid so I assume others already got info",

    "postText": "Currently, I'd be able to get in via early decision, however my chance at normal admission would be questionable. I'd be unable to afford 60k a year, however I saw the average financial aid is $30,000. With early decision I understand that you legally must go to the school if accepted, but I would not know how much financial aid I would be getting untill I would be legally forced to attend the school. Is there anyway to figure out how much financial aid you will get before applying early decision?",

You'll want to have W-2s and relevant income info handy when you run the numbers, but the estimate it gave me is pretty close to what I actually get. You could also call the financial aid office and ask them for a ballpark or ask them if the number CollegeBoard gave you sounds realistic. Also consider that you can appeal your financial aid decision and having applied ED gives you significantly more leverage. ",

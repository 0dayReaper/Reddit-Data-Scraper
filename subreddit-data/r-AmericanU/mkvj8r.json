            "comment": "It's been quite a few years since I went through that but it was a great experience. My UC course was Environmental Science (which I'm interested in so that helped) and I got placed in a hall with the people in my UC course. There were also a few other UC classes in my hall as well. \n\nAs for meeting people, I'd say it helped because you're guaranteed a class with people you live with so you see them a bit more often. But you wouldn't have issues meeting people even if you skip out on UC.\n\nUC was basically a normal class but on top of the lectures we had, we would go out once every week or so to a place in DC relevant to our course (a museum, the zoo, etc.). The course helped me learn how to navigate around the city and use the metro when I was new. \n\nAs for timings, I can't exactly remember but I think I had the class 3 times a week? One lecture, one lab, and one field trip type thing, normally out in the city. It was one of my easiest and most enjoyable classes.\n\nThere even was a UC course I got to do in my second semester where I went abroad to Nicaragua. Obviously, your mileage may vary but I wouldn't pass up on UC if I was given the option. That is, if any of the classes are something you're remotely interested in.\n\nGood luck.",

So it's pretty easy to find it. That said, that was years ago in one of the older freshmen dorms so it may be different now. \n\nAnd I had a science lab portion as part of the course so that was done in an entirely different building with lab facilities.\n\nIt was a few years ago so things are a bit hard to recall. I think it primarily was like any other class just with those few caveats (living in same hall as classmates and the field trips) that I highlighted in the previous comment.\n\nNo problem.",

I only had it twice a week, and it ended up being the most interesting class I've had throughout my whole freshman year (and it's completely outside my major).

We lived in Letts at the time so most of the freshman were on that side of campus so easy to meet people outside the program. We also shared the floor with another UC class. \n\nReally enjoyed the class and the friends I made on my floor are still close friends today.",

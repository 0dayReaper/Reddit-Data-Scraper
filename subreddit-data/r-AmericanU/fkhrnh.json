    "postText": "Hello!! So I got my AU decisi\u00f3n letter today and I was admitted to the spring semester instead of fall. They suggested the AU Washington Mentorship Program for me to still take classes in the fall semester, just on a non-degree path. Does anyone know anything about how this is or what I should do?? Aren\u2019t most fall semester freshman courses just prerequisites and non-degree focused anyways?? Would it just be like I am there as a normal student? If anyone has any info or opinions it would be much appreciated :)",

            "comment": "Hi! I did the Mentorship program in the fall of 2017 (was an admit for the Spring 2018 class), so hopefully I can answer some of your questions on this. \n\nThe short answer is that yes, this will not get in the way of your four year degree and you will be on campus as if you are a normal student. However, there are some drawbacks. Number one is that you will not receive financial aid for the fall semester, and your transcript will always have you down as a transfer student. The classes you take aren\u2019t the best. Most are fairly boring, but most also counted towards gen ed credits (they changed gen ed requirements after my class, so it will be different for you. I\u2019d look more closely at this.)\n\nBasically, if you love American and it\u2019s your first choice, you\u2019ll feel like you got a fall admit as any other student. But if you\u2019re torn between two schools, it\u2019s probably worth it to go elsewhere.\n\nLMK if you have any questions about the program and I\u2019ll do my best to answer!",

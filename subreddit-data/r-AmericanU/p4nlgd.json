Food and housing is somewhat less relevant IMO because most people move off campus after freshman/sophomore year, and if you're still on junior/senior year housing is better.",

I haven\u2019t tried it yet because i\u2019m an incoming freshman but also consider how the meal plan allows you to eat across multiple locations on campus. instead of using only meal swipes at TDR you can use meal exchanges at the multiple off campus and on campus restaurants AU partners w",

Granted you might need to meet with fin aid counslersl, but my fin aid officer is a g. Other great things the location. I'm from a town of 700 people. So I get the comfort small town feel of tenly coupled with the fun city life of downtown. The Upass is paid for with tuition and means ypu use the metro for \"free\". So internships volunteer stuff ect. Is all free. Academic coaching and therapy is free. Free tutoring. Amazing professors (some are assholes but most are great). Check ratemyprofessor and go to the departments you think you might major in. I honestly love AU core, it helped me find my majors. Also settled on majors at the end of my sophomore year but will be able to finish on time. \nDownsides, if your major is going to be theater don't come here. My friends in fine arts have transfered or hate it here. There no need to pay this much money for mediocre education. \nNow that being said other fine arts areas I've heard are great.\nDownsides, not a lot of class options or room, usually don't get the classes you want. They often change major requirements, advising is mediocre as upperclassmen, and fu king horrible freshman year.",

    "postText": " Hey everyone, I'm pretty torn between these two schools right now. Each have some pretty big pros and cons and I'm looking for some advice on what people think. I'll lay out a chart as well as more in-depth explanations\n\nAt American, I'd be majoring in International Affairs. Additionally, I was accepted to the Sakura Scholars program, which means I'd be spending two years at Ritsumeikan in Kyoto, Japan. It's not a traditional college experience, but it's something that seems really cool. I've been to Japan before and know some Japanese, but I'm a bit worried about fitting in since there's only about 10 others in the program, and I'm not sure if I'd make any friends at Ritsumeikan since it's mostly Japanese students. American would cost me $30,000/year. The campus is nice and I'm super into politics so DC is a plus. But, I've heard some bad things about the food quality and dorms (specifically a mouse problem), and I'm not sure if the school is super great academically. I have one friend possibly going to American and my girlfriend might be in DC as well. I'm not if I'd be able to get a job coming out of college at American though, even with the Sakura Scholars program.\n\nAt Northeastern, I'd have a combined major in International Affairs and PolySci. It's definitely a good school academically, but I've heard that the College of Social Science and Humanities isn't as well funded as the others. I really like Boston as well. (Boston and DC are about the same distance from where I live, I'd be fine in either city). The biggest downside is that it costs about $55,000/year, although I have appealed and am waiting to hear back. Both are theoretically affordable since I don't have any other siblings in college and my family is decently well off, but I don't want to stress my parents moneywise. Co-ops are also a super cool feature and I would still get to study abroad for at least a semester (hopefully an international co-op as well). Co-ops mean that I'd be likely to get a job which is nice. Finally, I have one of my best friends I've known since middle school going, and another super good friend quite possibly going.\n\nAmerican:\n\nPros:\n\n* Sakura Scholars Program\n* Cheaper\n* Campus and location\n* Politically-minded student body\n* Might have a friend at the school and girlfriend in the area\n\nCons:\n\n* Dorms/Cafeteria\n* Job Opportunities after college might be limited\n* Limited group of friends sophomore and junior year\n\nNortheastern:\n\nPros:\n\n* Academically strong school\n* Location\n* Co-ops basically guarantee a job after college\n* One of my best friends going, another one possibly going\n* Would probably get to skip a semester due to APs\n\nCons:\n\n* College of Social Sciences not valued very highly\n* Expensive\n* Likely won't have as many opportunities abroad\n\nThanks for the help!",

The \"job opportunities after college might be limited\" seems wrong for AU, since that's where a ton of IR and poli sci jobs exist, and you can get the relevant internship experience by going to school in DC.",

            "comment": "I cannot emphasis enough how important being in DC is for a career in IR/polisci.  Especially for anything international. AU is leagues past Northeastern.  Ritsumeikan won't help you a ton in the states in terms of Name recognition, but is helpful in Asia.  I hate to put the pressure on you, but your choice here will depend a lot on what you want your future to look like\n\nedit:  For IR, to be honest, anyone outside of DC is at a very big disadvantage.  For political science, if you do well you'll have more opportunities over the summer",

Also, I know some friends that are in the Sakura Scholars program and they\u2019re just eager to head off to Ritsumeikan next semester. Also, when deciding where to go don\u2019t let your girlfriend or friends dictate your school choice and the future job opportunities available to you. It\u2019s all about building your resume like finding organizations to work in and DC or like most cities have tons of options. You just got to put the time and effort that\u2019s all. IMO.",

            "comment": "I went to NU for undergrad and AU for grad.\n\nIf money really isn't a concern (as in no loans), I'd say Northeastern. Boston's not the middle of nowhere. You can get the polisci and IR experience there, PLUS it's co-op so it's likely to be paid, same with international co-op, it's less competitive so you'll get a good position and then come out with a job. The courses are way more challenging as well.\n\nWhen I was there arts &amp; sciences hadn't split yet, but your major isn't one that needs state of the art funding, and because there are so many schools in Boston and professors can work at multiple, the professors are top-notch.\n\nAnd the food is better. \n\nThis is an AU sub, so people are probably going to say AU and downvote me, but I've actually gone to both, so I hope it helps.",

            "comment": "Have you visited both campuses?\n\nI went to AU and live in Boston.  NEU is traditionally a commuter school.  It's changed a bit as their engineering school improved and they built more dorms.  Still NEU doesn't have much of a campus and it borders some rough neighborhoods.  A lot of NEU students end up living on Mission Hill which is part of Roxbury and very greasy. Granted the campus is close to Back Bay, Fenway, and other neighborhoods are easily accessible. I think the co-op program is kind of a scam.  You can get just as much experience with an internship/part-time job. NEU has more school spirit.  The hockey and basketball teams are good.\n\nI think AU has the edge on NEU in IR reputation.  The dorms are oldish but they're not ancient.  You will have mice and other infestation anywhere there is a lot of food left out.  Although NEU has some new dorms, they have old ones and off campus apartments that are worse.  AU has a nice campus but the overall location is far from a lot of the fun stuff in DC.  Getting around in Boston has a slight edge (the colleges in Boston are all a lot closer together).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeems like you're focused on academics and job placement which are really important.  I'd say their reputations are pretty close in these areas.  A question you have to ask yourself is where do you see yourself after graduation?  Do you want to stay in the DC or Boston area for a few more years for work/grad school and then branch out?  Both areas have large Japanese populations (Boston's might be bigger). DC is more international and political, and Boston more regional/provincial,biomed, finance, and engineering focused.  IDK anything about the Sekura program but it sounds like a big commitment.  Try to get as much info as possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHappy to answer any questions.",

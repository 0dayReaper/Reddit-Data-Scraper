    "postText": "Trying to map out PhD options and AU is high on my list. For both the PS and IR PhD programs, AU advertises tuition remission and a stipend in return for 20 hours a week of research or teaching work under a professor. I haven't been able to find any information on the website about the amount of the stipend. \n\nDoes anyone know how much it is monthly? This is critical to factoring in whether or not I can afford to live in/around DC with a family. Thanks!",

You can use the Symmetry calculator on the [HR website](https://www.american.edu/hr/benefits/education/tr.cfm) to figure out how much tuition remission will cost you.  It definitely ends up being cheaper than paying full tuition, but it eats into your paycheck a bit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit:  Here's what's included in the remission\n\nWhat's covered\n\n* Tuition for eligible courses taken at AU and Wesley Theological Seminary is covered.\n* A maximum of 8 credits per semester.\n* A maximum of 20 credits per academic year.\n\n## What's not covered\n\n* [Some courses are not covered](https://www.american.edu/hr/benefits/education/upload/Programs-Ineligible-for-Tuition-Remission.pdf).\n* Application, exam, or matriculation fees.\n* Course or lab fees.\n* $50 non-refundable administrative fee.",

If it's a full tuition remission, then it will cover the cost of as many credits as is considered full time for a phd student, so that looks like it would cover 12 credits each semester of your first year.",

This can be with one professor or two per semester. The stipend is $1,100.00 every two weeks while the semester is in session, but it does NOT include winter and summer breaks. If your advisor has grants they will usually pay your stipend over these gaps and sometimes give you a lil extra so you make more than $1,100/2 weeks. My adviser did not have grants, so I only got the $1,100 when the spring and winter sessions were up.",

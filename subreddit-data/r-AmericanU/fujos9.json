    "postText": "So I got accepted to AU and University of Oregon. I'm waiting on waitlists but right now I have to decide between the two and it's been so hard. Both are around the same price (about $50k a year, is it worth it?). I was accepted into Oregon's Honors College and AU's CBRS program. I got into AU for International Studies but now I want to go into Environmental Science (perhaps double major?) I know AU isn't known for its STEM program so that's what's been holding me back from committing to AU.  How do I choose? Is AU worth the cost if I go into STEM there?",

            "comment": "AU is investing a lot more into STEM, and I think Environmental Science is one of the more popular STEM majors\u2014pretty good overlap into public policy, I imagine. I don't know enough about AU's program or UofO to give you an informed opinion, just something to chew on.\n\n&gt;I know AU isn't known for its STEM program\n\nI see variations of this concern from a lot of potential students on here (as well as some people giving suggestions), and I can see why it'd hold people back, but I don't think it should be as big a problem as people make it out to be. If a school *is* known for the program you're interested in, then it makes sense to seek it out, but if it isn't that doesn't necessarily make it a bad program; the only concern should be if it's known for *being bad*. AU is a school known for politics, so of course people don't think about it for STEM, but that doesn't mean you *shouldn't* study STEM here. Especially if you are also interested in international service as well.\n\nI'm speaking, of course, from the perspective of an arts major at a school for politics. We're an oft-ignored subset of the community, but we have a fantastic program, despite our lack of reputation. I don't know how much that logic applies to STEM, because I don't have many friends studying it, but I wouldn't be surprised if it did.\n\nI'm not trying to persuade you for or against American. Just trying to give you a more holistic perspective to consider things with. Like I said, I might recommend AU if you think you're going to do IS\u2014regardless of if you do ES as well\u2014but I don't know enough about either program to know for sure.",

                    "comment": "I echo this. \n\nAU is known however for cross disciplinary education. Many students pursue second majors or minors at others schools in the university, and when I was there in 2011, there was a very popular CLEG (https://www.american.edu/spa/gov/degrees/ba-cleg.cfm) major. I could see a really competitive synergy in a double-major consisting of environmental studies and CLEG. While AU is not known for STEM per se, AU has had a bevy of successful STEM majors, including the founder of Blackboard, so the program is not bad. AU has a lot to offer that easily offsets that perceived gap, if you are strategic about it anyway. \n\nUltimately, if you plan well and work hard you\u2019ll be able to get an amazing job. One thing AU will offer you that UO won\u2019t is the opportunity to make connections with people and students in one of the most important and powerful cities in the world.",

            "comment": "While AU\u2019s STEM programs are not impressive, they are by no means bad. Being not so well known for STEM is a blessing in disguise sometimes, as the programs are smaller and you interact with the professors better. You also have bigger chances at academic researches and TA position. AU is finishing up the Hall of Science building (I believe it\u2019s for Environmental Science?) so when you attend (assuming the outbreak is over) you\u2019ll have the experience with that buildings. It\u2019s full of state-of-the-art labs and solar panels and I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ll enjoy the experience. \n\nI was a STEM student at AU (Master of statistics) and I really enjoyed my experience. I went to a state school for undergrad known for its STEM programs and it was just too competitive. I ended up with almost 0 working experience. When I got to AU I received academic research opportunity, worked in the tutoring lab at DMTI, and received LORs from my professors. My machine learning professor TA\u2019ed me one-on-one for an hour, which is unimaginable at a state school say UMD. And now, with my AU stem degree, I found a job at downtown DC working as an analyst for a healthcare system. I\u2019ve worked with physics majors, math majors, stats majors, most of them seem to be doing well. My colleagues at AU now work for Department or Defense, Booz Allen, Geico, and they\u2019ve done internship all around Dc, including homeland security, NASA, Le\u00eddos, etc. \n\nIf the cost is about the same and you\u2019re fine with leaving home ( I assume you\u2019re from Oregon), then I recommend AU. The opportunities in DC are just hard to pass up.",

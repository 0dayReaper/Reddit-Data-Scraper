I believe there may be an option for frequency but again that is priced at 8500ish dollars for a semester and that might still be completely full as well. Not too sure about medical accommodations but I'd assume they'd put you in a single in the freshman dorms which are traditionally doubles. I'd say your best bet for getting a single is to look off campus. There's a Facebook group called AU housing and sublets. Otherwise there are places like the Berkshire or the Avalon which are a short walk from campus.",

Honestly it\u2019s probably cheaper to get off campus housing, I just need to save up enough $ while I\u2019m still living at home this fall semester lol the only reason living in a dorm is more of an options is because my student loans cover it \ud83d\ude43",

I did not remain on campus as a Junior, but I assume they\u2019ll be able to help you out. I only graduated earlier this year, so this was recent as well.",

            "comment": "Short answer, probably not happening. Long answer is that the option wasn\u2019t available earlier this year when I was selecting housing, and it explicitly stated that singles would not be given out. I assume if you have a medical/psychological condition that necessitates a single they may be more accommodating. But otherwise, I know that they\u2019re already short on housing to begin with.",

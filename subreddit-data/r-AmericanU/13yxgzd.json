            "comment": "Hey, congratulations on your acceptance to AU! I moved from northern CA to DC to attend AU, so I hear you on the social change. Most people I met in DC moved here from the East Coast, but there's still a sizable CA transplant presence and a city feel similar to San Francisco or LA.\n\nFrom your other posts, it seems like you're focusing on DC school. A big pro of attending AU while studying IR is there are a ton of opportunities for internships and visiting embassies/think tanks in person. Compared to the other big schools in DC, AU has a much larger and more 'collegial' campus with beautiful grounds and historic buildings. The SIS building, where you'd take most of your IR classes, is one of the newest at AU and a great place to learn. Also, the AU alumni network is very active in the DC area, so you can find alumni on LinkedIn that have a job you want to invite them for a coffee. I've met with AU alumni who work for the Department of State, have gone on to law school, etc.\n\nOne con compared to other DC schools is that AU is located a little farther from DC landmarks like the White House and the Library of Congress. GWU, for example, is extremely urban and right next to downtown while Georgetown has its own little community (that isn't accessible from the subway). However, AU offers shuttles to nearby metro stops to help students get downtown easily. Another con is that our off-campus life is a little sleepy. The area where AU is situated is home to many ambassadors' residences and historic homes, so while there is great food around, living off campus might require a car.\n\nI'm happy to answer more questions if you want, just send me a Dm.",

            "comment": "fellow californian attending AU here! depending on where you are from in cali, there is a chance of a major cultural shock just due to the differences in the communities in DC. \n\nother than that, there\u2019s really no major social change in the sense of getting along with peers. sure, there will be some verbiage or behaviors that you\u2019ve never experienced before, but that\u2019s the fun of it! you get to learn about experiences of others who had completely different backgrounds than yourself. \n\nmy personal list of pros and cons:\n\npros: \namazing professors \ncareer and education opportunities \nonce you find that right community within AU, it\u2019s so amazing! \nclose proximity to Tenleytown Station for metro access \nUPASS (card that gives you access to busses and metro) \nvery open and welcoming LGBTQ+ community \n\ncons: \nadministration has been lacking on multiple fronts, resulting in on campus protests \nnestled in a quiet neighborhood, not so close to downtown or the national mall\nsome students have a, for lack of a better word, god complex. they may be overbearing with their political views or behavioral views in general (however you can find those people that are less into politics) \nnot a party school, some frats throw but it\u2019s more common to hold dorm parties, go to clubs/bars in the city, or attend another university\u2019s frats.",

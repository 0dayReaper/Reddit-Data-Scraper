            "comment": "Here is a clue as to why so many staff are upset with the administration.  President's salary has bloated up over $1m a year.  9% rise in 2019.  While AU staff get a merit raise pool of only 4%.  And inflation is over 8%.  Sure benefits are good, but many many people at the University are very under compensated already, and AU isn't doing much to make sure that doesn't get worst - especially not for the \"little people\".  Of course senior admin get big cushy raises.\n\nhttps://www.theeagleonline.com/article/2022/03/burwell-salary-increased-by-more-than-9-percent-in-2019-new-report-says",

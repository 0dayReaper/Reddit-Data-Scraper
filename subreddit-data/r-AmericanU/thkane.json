    "postText": "I recently got accepted to AU and into the Cornerstone program. This seems like a really exciting opportunity and is definitely a deal-maker for me. I do want to wait to hear back from a few more schools before committing to AU, however. \n\nI am aware spots in the program are limited. My question is how long do you think I can wait before committing to ensure there will still be spots available in the program?",

They are easy to come by during the spring and fall semesters because you don\u2019t have people coming in from outside the DMV area. Summer internships are a bit harder to get because you do have other students coming in just for the summer to intern. \n\nFor example, I had two very good internships during undergrad that I got on my own. I also think like 95% of students intern at AU too at some point during undergrad too. \n\nIn addition to that, AU has one of the best study abroad programs in the country. Because you\u2019re polisci, you would probably like the Brussels program where I think you can intern in the European Union headquarters or NATO. \n\nI would definitely pursue it more if they help you get an internship so you have one secured but by being in DC you will have so many more opportunities then being somewhere else (this has been proven to be true for me).",

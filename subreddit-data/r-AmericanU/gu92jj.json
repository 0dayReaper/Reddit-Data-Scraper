    "postText": "So Im an AU grad who got really accustomed to the Consortium Library Access Lifestyle. \nI love doing research, but one you graduate and move away they dont let you keep your access (despite the thousands of dollars I paid them over my 4 years...)\n\nAnyway\nI would love if someone would share said access with me \n\nI can offer you my amazing research skills in exchange, or a professionally written resume and a resume writing crash course.\n\nI'm also a career educator, if for some reason you need a curriculum or lesson plan done and don't know how to so it lol\n\nLet me know!",

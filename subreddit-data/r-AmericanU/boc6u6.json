If I remember right, the average GPA for a transfer was around 3.2, but with that being said the acceptance rate was in the mid-60s, so with good letters of rec, a good essay, and solid extracurricular you can get it.\n\n\nEdit: regarding pre calc, that wasn\u2019t a requirement when I transferred in, in fact they accepted almost none of my math credits, and the ones they did accept didn\u2019t count towards my Gen Ed requirement. But perhaps they added a new requirement, i would ask them.",

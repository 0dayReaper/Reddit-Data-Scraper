Shuttle stops are pretty much only on campus so you\u2019ll have to be on campus to use it. \n\nThere\u2019s an app called TransLoc that has live locations and times. I\u2019m not sure if you need a student ID to get it or not. (It\u2019s been a while)",

Around 0.8 miles from the bus stop to Target. \n\nTarget is the best place to buy items in bulk. They got everything from clothes, goods, decors, to electronics. Occasionally, you might meet some familiar faces at Target. There are some \n\nAlso sometimes, I like to get breakfast at WholeFoods. It\u2019s a little bit pricey, and not so much familiar brands. I also heard that you could do Amazon returns.\n\nNow, if you\u2019re not really in the mood to go far, the Eagles Nest or East Campus market has some goods. To me they seem a little bit pricey.\n\nIf none of these work, there\u2019s also the option to deliver. You can use Eaglebucks to have stuff delivered to you.",

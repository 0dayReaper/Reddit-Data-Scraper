I am a business student in New Zealand but the way my degree is structured I can just take whatever first year papers of any discipline I want (i'll probably take 4 of them), because I need 3 first year papers to go back to my NZ degree and I can't take the 1 management paper I need to finish my management major so I figure I might as well just take first year papers.  \n  \nThis means that it should be pretty easy and I'll have a bit of free time to get out and do stuff which should be good! (Thats if I get accepted at AU of course). I'm looking for the normal US college experience I guess you could say so I want to go into dorms and I think that means having a roommate too. I'm easy to get along with and can put up with bad situations too.  \n  \nThanks for the help!",

How is that like?   \nWhat size room do you have?  \nAre the different faculties spread out or is it just one big university eg. is there a science building that is on the other side of the campus to the arts building etc?",

The Berkshire Apartments are right next to campus and the most common site of off - campus housing for students. Plus if you live in the dorms, you'll have a resident assistant living on the floor enforcing rules. Do you really want to be told what to do? Also, living in the dorms for 9 months is more expensive than renting an apartment for 12 (assuming you can find a roommate,  and AU has plenty of available resources for that).",

            "comment": "As much as I enjoyed living in the residence halls, both living and dining on-campus are unreasonably expensive. As a third-year student your options will be fairly limited in terms of on campus housing \u2013 you'd probably be placed into Centennial, Nebraska, or a leased unit at the Berkshire. Lots of AU students live in the buildings adjacent to campus (e.g. Berkshire, Avalon, Greenbriar, and Foxhall).\n\nAs for food \u2013 unless things have changed dramatically since I've been there, the meal plan is an absolute ripoff. Do the math and see what it breaks down to for each meal swipe, and you'll probably find that you can get a better deal just paying cash for on-campus dining venues. (Especially since if you put funds into the Dining Dollars on your AUID, you get a discount). If you do live on campus, they'll probably require that you have some kind of meal plan, but I'd recommend getting the smallest available and paying for the rest out of pocket (unless you have some sort of funding source that would cover your meal plan if it was purchased through the school).\n\nBest of luck!",

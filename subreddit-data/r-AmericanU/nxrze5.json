I have 20 minutes between classes\n\nWhat is the distance between Kerwin Hall and Myers Building? I also have 20 minutes lol\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

I usually got there in 10 min, as long as you walk kinda fast. 20 minutes is actually quite some time so don't feel rushed! I usually just walked at a comfortable pace with friends and still arrived to my classes on time.",

Also, depending on time of day, and how many friends you have, you may want to give yourself some buffer on days it's nice out so you can have time to grab food or chat up people while you walk thru the quad. \n\nAlso, sometimes they have little booths set up that sell tapestries and rings and posters and all kinds of stuff on the quad! (By mgc) But they leave by mid afternoon, so if you head out early you can swing by and look at stuff before class. (You'll never be annoyed you're too early for class, there's always something to work on or something you forgot to do.)\n\nOtherwise your just yelling \"text me!\" Over your shoulder a bunch; I had an ex who knew EVERYBODY so walks across campus with her took 30 minutes when they should have taken 10. So frustrating.\n\nAlso, I hate that they named a building after Neil Kerwin (if died or something, I didnt get the memo; i wont trash him or anything..except to tell you his real name is Cornelius lol but if he didnt die...he just named a building after himself. While alive. And probably still AUs president. Almost as ridiculous as his first name)",

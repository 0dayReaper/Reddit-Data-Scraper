            "comment": "TL;DR: Based on communications to date, I wouldn't expect campus to close because of Monkeypox. \n\nDr. Reitman's \\[medical director\\] email to the university on Monday suggested that the first case had been detected in the AU community, but given the lower transmission rate (and mechanism of transmission based on what we know about monkeypox)^(12) , it seems unlikely to result in closure. As far as 'how badly it'll go' generally - the challenges (financial, supply/logistics, stigma) in vaccine rollout would suggest that it isn't going to disappear from our lives entirely, but I (personally) don't think it'll cause major disruptions. \n\n^(1)[https://dchealth.dc.gov/page/monkeypox](https://dchealth.dc.gov/page/monkeypox)\n\n^(2)[https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/transmission.html](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/transmission.html)",

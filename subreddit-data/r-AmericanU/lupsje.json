But given legal implications, I am not entirely sure if that's the safest route. I would speak to Admissions or people at International Accelerator Program for more information!",

Instead, I ll go to Belgium. (They pay me 500 bucks per month if I go to Belgium). So, once again in my life, money was a barrier; yet, I believe I ll find a way to go to the US very soon. But, let's be honest: I am truly sad about it.",

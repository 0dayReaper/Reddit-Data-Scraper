It is possible things will become more normal within 3 months, but it is also possible (and unfortunately, I believe likely) that the number of cases will be going up starkly, and there will be a need to reinstitute lockdowns. (If not within 3 months, I certainly believe within 6.)\n\nBut anything can happen--we just don't know. We'll know what AU is planning when AU tells us what it is planning. And even then, no plan survives first contact with the enemy--things can still change even after plans are announced.",

Professors are encouraged to give finals before Thanksgiving. Of course GW said plans could change over the summer if case numbers spike significantly, but that is what they are shooting for. With that said, I think AU will be open in the fall with major restrictions.",

A lot of classes will probably have some online components. Access to campus may be restricted to certain days. Food service will probably not be in TDR etc.",

    "postText": "I've been a part of the AU community in a variety of dimensions since 2014. The fact that this nazi shit is coming back up is nothing short of disgusting. I Love AU, genuinely, and it makes me sick that we've got these hogs operating on campus, or that they have the ability to come onto campus at night. Is anyone else interested in organizing around this issue? Nothing illegal, no physical violence, but I want my classmates to feel safe and most importantly, I want to find out who's vandalizing our campus with some really abhorrent stuff. I'm not confident in the Administration and I'm wondering if anyone else is interested in starting a student working group to try and figure this out, and prevent it. DM me if interested.",

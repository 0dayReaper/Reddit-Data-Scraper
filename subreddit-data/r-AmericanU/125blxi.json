            "comment": "I\u2019m in Cornerstone DC and I think it\u2019s worth it. I\u2019m poly sci, and working on the hill my first year has been a great opportunity and definitely reaffirmed my decision to go to DC so far from home.\n\nI definitely see the appeal of Abroad. For me, though, I wasn\u2019t crazy about it mostly because the school you\u2019re at is tiny and in rural England 1+ hours from anything interesting. Basically you\u2019d only be able to do fun stuff on the weekends.\n\nThat being said, I don\u2019t know anyone who dropped out of abroad, but I know a TON who dropped out of the DC program. They sorta market it like you WILL intern, but they\u2019re really not much help. If you don\u2019t get it mostly on your own, you won\u2019t be interning.\n\nReally the only benefit is you can get credit for an internship freshman year, which you can\u2019t do otherwise. Overall I\u2019d say worth it if you have the drive.",

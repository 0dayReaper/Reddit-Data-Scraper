Are there any good connections/internships with the CIA/DIA or other government three letter agencies in this program at the university? Thanks in advance!",

I'm in the online program, but my view is yes..most of the professors whose classes I've taken have backgrounds in State Department or NGOs, but I get notices from Handshake about hiring events for three letter agencies all the time. They also bring in guest speakers with intelligence and security backgrounds frequently as well. My concentration is in conflict resolution and negotiation, so I imagine you would find more IC representation in the government security concentrations than mine too.",

            "comment": "A lot of AU alums go on to work in government but its not necessarily because of anything AU offers in particular outside of location. Being in DC is really the biggest reason why AU has a lot of civil servant grads, because you're able to attend the different job fairs in DC oriented around government work and it just attracts people who want to be near these kinds of jobs. A lot of professors have backgrounds in government though and speaking with them about the work could be helpful, more so than in an other unis. But AU doesn't really stand out that much from GWU, GU, GMU, or even UVA in my opinion in terms of academics or connections. This probably applies to those other schools though I never attened them. Again, location is just the biggest factor and even then those organizations hire people from across the country, including public unis in middle america if they think you have the skills they need. And having the skills  they need is more important than anything else in my opinion.",

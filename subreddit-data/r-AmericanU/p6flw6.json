Be very careful and read the fine print on variable rates, fixed rates will be a percent or two higher but will keep you from getting a variable rate that jumps up later in the life of your loan. Learned that the hard way. \n\nAgain, if you have to go private, get more than one quote before you decide. I\u2019d recommend looking at SoFi and Earnest (Earnest was bought by navient which might be a negative for some people but I haven\u2019t had an issue with them so far). Also check what your bank has to offer. \n\nStart making payments on your loans as soon as possible. Even $50/month before you\u2019re repayment date could help in the long run. If possible always pay your principal before interest. \n\nAnd above all else, stay away from Sallie Mae. Fuck Sallie Mae.",

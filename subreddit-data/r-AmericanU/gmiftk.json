            "comment": "Secondary Edu Major is rare (I was one) - most of your classes are gonna have lots of elem. edu people until you get to the last 2 semesters of courses. If you're really passionate about education, do lots and lots of reading on all perspectives, Critical Pedagogy is where it's at.\n\nI was AMST &amp; Secondary EDU - the only one in my class, I might add. Everyone else was good ol' History or English. The stuff you learn will be slanted toward whichever combination of majors is dominant in your class and their chosen age group. There will be cliques, be forewarned.\n\nThat said, you're in m'fucking DC! Take it from me - add a CSLP Credit or do an independent study credit and tack it on to whatever professor will sign off and have some fun with internships - reach out to nonprofits (smaller ones are more receptive to collaborative stuff)\n\nI worked with Teaching for Change (progressive and rights-based curriculum, Zinn Education Project partner) &amp; S.M.A.R.T. (student-led nonprofit under MLOV)\n\nI was also a research assistant for Professor Vassallo for 3 years - he's an AU professor who specialized in hating on Self-Regulated Learning (neoliberal agenda!) and Psych of Edu. He's a Foucault-scholar and a generally awesome human being. He'll sign off on whatever kind of independent learning project you want to do if you help him with whatever book he's working on :)\n\n***Also I think J. S. Boyd is FINALLY gone -*** *she was not a great person or Program Director.* \n\nLesson I learned from being enemies with the Director of the Teacher Certification Program - **don't be enemies (or even a person of interest) with the people in charge of your certification.** \n\nBe their friends, or at the very least, **blend in** when it comes to appearance and mannerisms (fake it if you must around the edu people, but **be real where it counts - with the kiddos and your chosen mentors).** \n\nMy shaved head, multiple ear piercings, and tattoo (it says \"teach peace\", but still) did me no favors when I got in trouble for doing push-ups (to stay awake) at a site I was supposed to be observing at (student-teaching, final semester before certification) - I was thrown out week 2 with 12 teaching credits to go before I met the grad requirements because JSB didn't see my \"passion\" for teaching...",

If I get in, I\u2019ll be doing English/Secondary Education.\n\nDo you happen to have any recommendations on Critical Pedagogy? I want to spend the summer refreshing my mind on education. It\u2019s been a while for me.\n\nI\u2019m really excited to live in DC (that is, if I even get into AU). I look forward to getting into some internships and nonprofits. \n\nWe need more teachers with piercings and tattoos. Your passion seems to be stronger than teachers with khakis and some Vineyard Vines. \n\nI\u2019ll be referring back to your response if I do get in- thanks again!",

It is all about how the Oppressed must liberate themselves and the way we can contribute is to increase access to education and literacy (because you cant do it for them or it wont count as liberation or empowerment) \nSomeone at AU will make you read chpt 2 at some point (easiest to read) - edu for intl development is a common gen ed, you'll see it there 1st.\nThat book changed my life and made me the badass educator I am today. And the unapologetic activist I was back in my AU days ;)\n\n**Others** - \nStephen Vassallo and I wrote \"*Critical Educational Psychology\"* (I was undergrad, so I got no title credit...but I am in the acknowledgements!)\nThat book had 10 chapters and covered Classroom Management, Developmentally Appropriate Practices, Self Regulated Learnin, Assessments, etc etc\nI still have drafts of chapters i wrote of my laptop i could send you if you want a free version lol\n\nI actually have a metric fuckton of articles and books downloaded - a small library of edu resources for all ages, covering ever \"ism\", every pedagogical theory (radical &amp; traditional. Mostly radical lol) \nI have so much stuff, dawg.\n\nMost are academic- but we all have to get used to working with those texts eventually...scholarly articles are all I read now\n\nSpeaking of - if you want to trade your university library access for any resources or any skills i have (im also a professional resume writer?) I would LOVE to work something out\n\nI miss all the databases \nJSTOR, ERIC, MUSE, SAGEPUB....my long lost friends",

    "postText": "SPA graduate here. My advice: don\u2019t waste time visiting your academic advisor. Literally the only thing they do is read the requirements you need to finish your degree directly from the website. They will NOT take an interest in your academic journey and recommend classes according to your interests (they won\u2019t even remember your name), they will NOT give you advice on how you can graduate as fast as possible or how to maximize transfer credits/college credits from high school. Literally the only thing they do is log in to the portal you have access to and then show you the document showing your major requirements. They were always pretty rude and seemed like they were busy despite the fact that their entire job seemed to consist of just showing students pdfs. The whole office is a useless joke and their salaries are a complete waste of tuition dollars. They either need to cut the whole department or actually make it useful (I.e., making them do something the website can\u2019t do.) Until then, don\u2019t waste your time.",

    "postText": "An Environmental Private Equity Organization focused on creating business/CO2 evaluations and making sustainability/mitigation mergers. It takes someone in the private market 15 contacts and two years to make a deal go through; this club would be a long-term relationship building system with university students to talk with chief sustainability officers, CFO's, CEO's and work on these deals either mock or in real world.\n\nBecause we overwhelmingly have the technology to reduce co2 emissions, big businesses just don\u2019t have the incentive or people pushing for it like they do with markets for Mergers and acquisitions and the like. \n\nWould anyone be interested in this?",

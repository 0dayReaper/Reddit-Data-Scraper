    "postText": "I got accepted to AU for Fall 2020 as a incoming sophomore. It has been my top school since starting my applications in the fall of my senior year of high school.\n\nUpon getting accepted I almost jumped out of my seat but my financial award kept me glued to the back of my chair. They gave me almost nothing. I am a seriously low income student with a couple thousand EFC. They gave me 15k per year. How could they expect me to pay a cost of tuition equal to my annual household income?\n\nI have a 4.0, a HSSP AFROTC student, star athlete, great recs and resume but I still got nothing.\n\nI emailed the office and contacted my financial advisor and he said that transfers were a second class priority over first year students and that my aid package was all that they could offer **ANY TRANSFER STUDENTS**. Is this true? *Has anyone received more in aid?*\n\nI am having the same problem with BU where they gave me the same amount *despite* having a higher cost of attendance. \n\nWhat is up with this? I didnt know transfer students were considered second class citizens in this racket",

For any college, I urge you to look at a debt calculator like https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/loans/student-loans/student-loans-extra-payments and consider the payback. This economy will take many years to recover from.",

Transferring to AU was the worst decisions I\u2019ve made along with taking out private loans for it. The best decision I made was to transfer to an in-state school.",

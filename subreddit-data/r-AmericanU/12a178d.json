    "postText": "Hi, I am likely going to attend AU in the fall and I have a few questions.\n\nIs honors worth it? They promoted a ton of stuff like trips and freshman year research, how much of this is a gimmick and how much of this is worthwhile?\n\nI know that it's likely an echo chamber, but Barstool American made AU look like a pretty bad place to go. Complaints seem to be about food, dorms, and stuff to do. Do students complain as much as it seems like on Barstool AU and are the complaints valid? Are there any food vendors included in the meal plan that don't suck?\n\nAlso, what's the social scene like? What is there do do at AU and around? Similarly, what is the dating scene like. I am a bisexual man if that makes a difference. Is AU as welcoming as they promote it to be?\n\nAnything else I should know? Thanks!",

Honors kind of hands the opportunities to you. Nobody really takes barstool seriously, like you said, it\u2019s an echo chamber. We\u2019re getting a Panera and a Qdoba next year so the food is going to improve, but it\u2019s gotten better over the years for sure. And a couple of the freshman dorms are being renovated this summer. \nCan\u2019t speak for the social scene for queer men but as a queer woman it\u2019s great. We\u2019re not called gAyU for nothing. Honestly probably one of the most welcoming student bodies for queer people. Administration is probably the worst part of the university but I feel like that\u2019s all colleges.",

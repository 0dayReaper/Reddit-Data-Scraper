            "comment": "Tuition is bullshit, way too expensive, the place tries to nickel and dime you whenever possible, especially on food (which is generally subpar for what you're paying) and housing, and the administration is a mess. All in all I like it here but I feel like the school doesn't have the best interests of its students at heart and is really in it to promote its own image and bring in money. One of the things that bothers me the most about the tuition is that it makes for a really homogenous community-- everybody who isn't rich and white is rich and foreign. I feel that it limits our experience and the discourse in class, especially at a school that specializes in politics during a time when income inequality is becoming a key issue. I'm also a cigarette smoker, so I disagree with the campus-wide ban which is coming into effect next semester, but I might be in the minority there.\n\nOn the plus side, the campus is pretty beautiful. Overall, unless you're really well off and want to pursue a degree in politics, business or international relations, I'd say screw this place.",

Glaring issues that I see, as compared the the megalopolis that is UW, is that everything seems manufactured, \"kiddy\", and slow moving.  Over emphasis on traveling abroad, over compensation on \"wonks\" while trying to become a research institution, complete negligence of programs other than SIS and IR.  Student body attitude reflects the price (you can see this in some of the comments here).  It feels mismanaged and certainly has been the last few decades.  \n\nI'm no provost, but AU makes a good amount of money per year--the progress that I've seen over the seven years that I've know AU has not been proportional to that money.  However, as explained to me, AU has been teetering on bankruptcy since the 80's and is now only digging its way out of the hole.  Kerwin is using all the money that is now coming in, to invest and grow the campus, which seems promising as long as that money stream keeps coming in.  Who knows how it will change but things seem on the up swing.\n\nThe good?  DC is one of the most beautiful cities in the US.  Current undergrads will complain about it, but most are from the east coast and have no clue what the rest of the country looks like.  DC is clean, unique, with decent public transportation and more than enough to do.  Its expensive, but all nice cities are.  The amount of nostalgia I got coming back to DC was through the roof.  The weather is a nice mix between cold/hot.  I would move back in a heart beat.\n\nI had a lot of fun at AU, made a lot of lasting friends, had professors I still communicate to on a first name basis.  You definitely will be hard pressed to do the later at a Big school.\n\nAdditionally, anyone who thinks Kerwin is terrible needs to read up on AU president history.\n\n\n\n\n ",

            "comment": "Let me try to address a few things that people are complaining about on here:\n\nTuition: This is Washington, it's not cheap to live here and they have to pay professors at a pretty high level because they can demand it. Let's also remember that the school is attempting to full top professors from Georgetown and GW, bigger names to put after their own.  There is an arms race happening between DC schools now, so the school has to invest lots of money in everything to keep up and stay relevant.  Also, I know a lot of people that get aid and getting a work study job both on and off campus is easy. \n\nFaculty:  There are great teachers. There are horrible ones. Same at every school. You just might have to dig a bit for the best but, they are out there and are approachable, fair, and great people if you get to know them and go to office hours.\n\nThe campus:  It can be a bubble but then again, it's not in a college town. You don't HAVE to leave if you don't want to and it can get easy to get stuck in that trap but, there is plenty in the city to check out.  It is beautiful though, fall is actually amazing here, something I was not expecting.  \n\nStudents:  Lots of east coast, lots of Jersey girls but, that is changing fast as the school grows in recognition and recruits better and the attitude is face paced and can be mean if you are from the midwest or west. I think the class of '17 has California as the largest number of students. But, there are know it alls, there are assholes, there are people who have way too much money than they know what to do with but, you should visit and see how it feels and there is a place for everyone. Seriously there is, the campus is actually super diverse and you can find your people as long as you aren't sitting inside your room all day and only leave for class.  There  are a lot of people that are very passionate about what they are here for and it can be annoying if they really think they're the smartest person ever but, it isn't often that that happens. \n\nFood:  Yeah, it has good days and bad ones. But, you aren't pigeon-holed into one place, there are options. They just changed providers this year, so there is some confusion still and growing pains.  Maybe I'm too nice but, I will concede that TDR (the dining hall) is really struggling to keep up.\n\nParties:  They're there. You can party every night, every weekend, or never. You can go frat or off campus or even in dorms if that's your thing. It's all there. The scene does change once the first few months pass though, parties get more excessive as frats try to get pledges, which can be annoying as a guy but, if you are a girl, make friends with the guys and you'll be fine. Be sure if you want to do bars and clubs you are 21 or have a decent fake. Some are way better than others at carding but, I haven't had hassles. \n\nDirection of school and other things:  There are little things that are annoying and are stressful. There is red tape but, this is also a huge university. And yes, there is a LOT of money that goes to a few schools but, those are their flagship programs.  There is a lot of work going to SOC and SPA now, which will hopefully be better to diversify the student body.  I love it here, I hate it some days but, I promise if you do come you will find your place here.\n\nFeel free to message me if you want to know more. \n\n\n\n",

Yeah, the administration is rough sometimes, and tuition is pretty high, but if you come to AU to learn about international affairs, or politics, or Business, or Math, or really whatever we've got a program in, I think you get a decent education and a great opportunity to make connections.

Otherwise, we have good programs, but maybe we should be a backup. \n\nEveryone here is saying the administration is awful. They clearly have never seen another school's administration, which are all terrible.

Of all my friends, smart, dumb, ambitious, lazy... there was never that much difference in job placement and quality of jobs after graduation (albeit this is 2009). Especially not if you're talking $30 to $40K+ per year! Do well in a cheaper college. Have fun. Spend your money where it counts in grad school. The undergrad degree is not nearly as valuable as it once was, so don't blow an extra $80k or so on the degree by going someplace elite, prestigious, or whatever else makes a school so god damn expensive.\n\nAnd if you don't go to gradschool after, that's fine too, you'll be rid of your debt all the sooner!\n\nBest of luck.

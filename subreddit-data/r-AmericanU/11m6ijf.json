Everyone looks for different things in a college and when am I looking for schools I am not just looking for the absolute top program for psychology, I am looking for an all around match for me. I just felt most at home on the campus when I visited and it felt really great to be in an environment where there are a lot of people passionate and focused on politics and values. Of course American is one of many schools, I completely agree, and I am looking at multiple, but I have found it to be a school where I feel I would fit very well. I hope by asking for more insight on the school and some personal perspectives it may help with my decisions for the future. Completely see you and hear you, and my intent and with this reply is to explain my reasoning, not to argue by the way, I just want to clarify my tone because sometimes it\u2019s hard over text :)",

If you have the finances to really find a school where you feel at home, regardless of price tag, then go for it! \n\nI\u2019m a grad student, and I don\u2019t feel the community as strongly as I think undergrads might. A lot of people are politically active, and they have a lot clubs and sports teams to join. I didn\u2019t attend GW, but it felt a lot like my undergrad when I visited, which had better resources than AU but less community. \n\nImportant to note: I went to a state school that was referred to as a commuter school, so there was *a* community but not your standard *college experience* kind of community.",

The psych majors I\u2019ve met also seem pretty nice and normal. AU is not particularly known for its STEM programs but it is definitely improving with the opening of the Hall of Science.",

            "comment": "I did my undergraduate at AU, and am now doing my grad at UW-Madison (Football team ranked 20th in the nation).  This is obviously written by students who have never experienced football.\n\n&gt; For many colleges, the football team is a marketing ploy, one that AU simply doesn\u2019t need.\n\nAU has TV commercials, wonks, and bus ads, all trying to market the university. Its obvious AU needs marketing ploys.\n\n&gt;  lack of an NCAA team is irrelevant for most AU students.\n\nCan't knock it if you've never experienced it.\n\n&gt; We find our sense of pride and community in other ways: academics, rather than all-star athletes, get the fans at AU.\n\nA great school is well rounded and is known for research, undergraduate education, and athletics.  \n\n&gt; we didn\u2019t come to AU to watch our friends and peers become famous for winning NCAA Player of the Year awards.\n\nOf course not, you came to go to school.  Football is fun to watch.\n\n&gt; We\u2019re much more interested in the future possibility and likelihood that we will vote for the guy who sat next to us in an SPA class into the House or Senate, or watch the girl from ATV anchor a nightly newscast on CNN.\n\nArguing that its much more noble to pursue this instead of football?  What about everything else at AU.  \n\n&gt; we aren\u2019t forced to become avid sports fans or feel like lesser students if we aren\u2019t on a team\n\nNobody is forced.  A very small percent of the student pop is on a team.\n\n&gt;\"Wow that\u2019s a great school,\u201d rather than, \u201cWow, you have a great football team.\u201d\n\nWhy not both?  Wisconsin is both a football powerhouse and one of the top five research universities in the world, typically ranking in the top 10 in all subjects by US News.\n\n\nLastly, I leave you with this.  Have you ever said or heard \"Once and Eagle, Always an Eagle?\" and cringed?\n\n  **Imagine having this much school pride with your fellow students**:\n\n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnYCdKDI5hk.  Skip to 1 minute if you're impatient.  \n\n**Imagine having a time honored tradition like jump around**:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=veHQMaxiOmg#t=47\n\n**You'll never get to experience several generations of Eagles singing.** \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXUNCi4XdHo\n\nAn experience like this, is something AU students, sadly, don't get to experience.  School pride is nearly non-existent.  I'm glad to have both AU and UW-Madison as my alma mater at this point, but I don't think I will ever have the deep pride for AU that I have for UW-Madison.  AU Students leave AU and never come back.  Wisconsin alumni return every fall, pay crazy ticket prices, at all ages, to stay involved in the school through football.\n",

No funding from the department goes into the school, no money for the school goes towards Johnny Football's scholarship.  All scholarships, I believe, are paid for out of the athletic departments money.\n",

Alabama and American are very closely ranked in US News (American #74, Alabama #86), but Alabama has one of the top MFA creative writing programs, while American's is middling. Alabama has one of the best law schools, while American's is routinely considered the most overrated (and it's not even that highly rated). I don't know if it's still the case, but the Alabama English department used to win nearly half of all the awards at the English Honors Society national convention.\n\nAnd the sports hardly detract from the arts there. Guerrilla Theater was regularly sold out. The Million Dollar Band is considered one of the best marching bands in the nation (they got the name for outshining the football team). The school paper is published 4 days a week. The Black Warrior Review is considered one of the top lit journals in the country, and not just of university journals, but all journals.",

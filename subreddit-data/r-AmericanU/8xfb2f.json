Or I would be okay if there is a link within AU central that takes me to a different webpage. But, this time, I had to go back to the email that they sent out in the beginning of this week, locate the payment plan link and click that. That led me to [this page](\nhttps://www.american.edu/finance/studentaccounts/Payment-Plan-Overview.cfm) that explains American Payment Plan Overview. Finally, when clicking on the link to sign up for the payment plan, the website again takes me to a fucking Surveymonkey webpage. I filled it out for now and I lost it when it showed me a page that says I need to wait 5-7 days.\nI don't need this crap. I should be able to see the payment plan details right away and set up the payment. It does feel like too much of nothing.",

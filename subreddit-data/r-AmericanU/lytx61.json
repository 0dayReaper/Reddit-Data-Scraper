    "postText": "Hi, I'm sure this gets asked a million times, but I could really use some help navigating DC living. \n\nI (21F) was accepted into SIS, so my girlfriend and I are looking for a 2-3BR apartment near AU. But it's like anywhere that would be affordable for us is across the city! While I don't mind commuting (I do 35 min each way for work right now), we don't know what neighborhoods are decent in the DC area. \n\nRight now, it feels like our best option is to move to Bethesda, MD, which isn't terrible, but not necessarily my ideal. If anyone has any comparisons to Atlanta or Georgia, that would be great because all of the apartment sites are driving me up a wall.",

They're also pretty ticket-happy, so watch out. The good thing is that they offer a pass for using the Metro and Bus system for when the semester is in session. It makes all public transport free for you during the semester, but it gets factored into your student fees each semester (something like $135). I know that sounds like a lot, but, I was recharging my metro pass with $35 a week, so that's a great deal. Besides, lots of people sell their metro passes for some decent cash, even though it's against the rules to do so.",

The buses on Wisconsin go to a bunch of good spots in DC, but Glover Park has no metro, so if close metro access is a deal breaker it would be tough. That said, you can hop on the D1 or D2 in Glover that goes right to Dupont or the buses on Wisconsin go to GW station and there's your metro access. Feel free to shoot any questions over!",

It's walking distance to the Grosvenor/Strathmore stop for the Metro, which is why we moved here. Thing is, they're looking at closing this Metro stop because of low ridership (which is because of the pandemic). The area is in an uproar about the proposed closure because it would make the property value and all reason for living here plummet. That being said, we have loved it over here. There's a row of apartments in the Grosvenor Park area that are all really nice with a convenient Grosvenor Market close by.",

You dont even really have to lock your front door. No one will come bother you or your stuff. We have never had packages or deliveries stolen as there's a 24-hour concierge service. There's a lot of cameras and security features around the building. The only downside is that lately people have been breaking into the cars that are in the parking lots. Some people even got into the parking garage to break into cars, and the parking garage requires a key fob to get into. Despite this, I would 100% recommend this building and area\n\nEdit: forgot to answer all of your questions, oops! It's really more residential. There's a lot of small kids, people with dogs, people going for runs/ riding their bikes, but that's really it. There are shopping centers and strip center shopping somewhat close by, but not really within walking distance. If you were to drive to them you would be there in 5-10 minutes though. Before Covid everything was just a quick Metro ride away. Now though... I just drive to stay away from the people. :(",

You could make a myAU account the second the letters got mailed out if you got in.  If they\u2019re alerting people online now the trick probably doesn\u2019t work",

I can only only speak from my personal experience as an ED applicant in 2015, but I got the call from my admissions counselor on December 17th.\n\nReally, there isn't anything you can do at this point (and that's seriously not a negative nor a positive thing - it just is what it is). I'd seriously recommend taking a walk or something to get your mind off of it and whatever happens, happens. \n\nThe best thing is that no matter what happens, you'll either be in, or you'll still have room to course correct and apply to a few more schools \u2014 and then you can always transfer a year into college if you're interested.\n\nBut now that you know your stakes \u2014 and that your contingency paths to AU are several, the extra stress just isn't worth your time. Take that anxious energy and channel it towards working out, doing a puzzle, calling your grandparents, or volunteering at your local food bank. I wish you the best and hope it works out! \ud83e\udd85\u270c\ufe0f",

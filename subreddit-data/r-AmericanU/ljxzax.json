The best thing to do is to have a housing group of your friends, and then if you don\u2019t get a spot in campus, start looking for places off campus, maybe even reaching out to a local realtor (that\u2019s how I got my place my senior year). \n\nBut I lived on campus as a junior (but had a roommate who had housing accommodations) and I don\u2019t recall too many people who wanted to live on campus that couldn\u2019t. East campus had just opened the spring semester of my junior year though, so it may be even easier now (but who knows with Covid shit).",

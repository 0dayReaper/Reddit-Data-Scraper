Any tips from journalism majors going in? How is the program do you seem to be drowning in work? \n\nAlso how is the social scene at american if I\u2019m also looking to rush?",

I switched cuz I realized it\u2019s not what I wanted to do, but still it was really fun and i love all the classes anyways. One great thing about journalism is that I never had any finals during finals week, so I always got to leave a week before all my friends. Advising in the school of communications is a little weird. But overall it\u2019s cool. I also have a minor in political science that I\u2019m starting this semester, so we might end up having a class together! \n\nThe two words I would use to describe the AU social scene are white and gay. There\u2019s so many super privileged white people. And a whole lot of gay people. \n\nI don\u2019t know anything about rushing. Sorry!\n\nYou\u2019ll probably love AU",

I really enjoyed the program overall. Felt that i developed valuable skills I\u2019m pretty much every area of media which is extremely valuable. Every major has its work but it\u2019s sort of harder to give exams on things like article writing so it\u2019s definitely more project oriented. Unfortunately I can\u2019t help much with the Greek life stuff",

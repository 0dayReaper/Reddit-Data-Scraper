            "comment": "The cultures ok. They have a pre med society and a pre med frat- they have an advisor too and she\u2019s pretty cool- had her as a prof. The school focuses a lot on SIS but the pre med program seems ok. I transfered into it late but I felt like there wasn\u2019t a lot of support. It\u2019s sink or swim so you have to be really self motivated. The students are also really cliquey sometimes but that\u2019s kind of every college, if you find a few to hang onto then you become very tight knit. I found I had closer friendships with kids outside my major and I had a great time with Greek life. I went before the new building was built so I heard there\u2019s better facilities now compared to Hearst Hall",

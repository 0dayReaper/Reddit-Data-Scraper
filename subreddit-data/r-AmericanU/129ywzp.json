Is this a common issue? I would have to transfer if my aid got taken away so I definitely don\u2019t want to be stuck in that position. Has anyone successfully kept their aid all 4 years?",

But when my kid was there, we ALWAYS challenged the awards and as long as you are a student they want, they will usually increase it.   \n\n\nSo if it becomes undoable in your junior or senior year., def challenge and appeal",

It isn't necessarily the hardest thing to do if you put in effort, I think my GPA cutoff was 3.2, but the thing that can get you is if you fail a class. Because then your GPA not only tanks, but if you aren't able to add another class you may finish the year with less than 30 credits and therefore lose it.\n\nThey're a lot less strict with need-based aid though.",

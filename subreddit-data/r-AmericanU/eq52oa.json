    "postText": "I'm a sophomore transfer student, and I took college writing at my previous college. The class at my previous college was almost exactly the same (though probably better) as WRTG101. I already took WRTG100 first semester, because they wouldn't give me credit for it from my first college writing class. The credit from my previous college was articulated as a random 100-level literature class. I have submitted a petition to have it reevaluated, but I don't know if I'll get an answer before the add/drop period is over. I really don't wanna take this class, and I have all sorts of other classes I need to take if I want any hope of graduating on time.\n\nHowever, the first part of the writing sequence (WRTG 100 and WRTG 101) apparently must be taken in your first 30 credits at AU. My question is, what would happen if I drop the class and the credit from my previous college is still not deemed good enough to cover it? Would I be able to suck it up and take the course next year? It says something about impeding me from registering for the subsequent semester if it's not taken in my first 30 credits.\n\nThanks in advance!!",

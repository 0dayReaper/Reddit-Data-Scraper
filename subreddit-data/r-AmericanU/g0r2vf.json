As part of this project, which will be published in the fall, the team is collecting survey data from a wide range of people to understand how mental health affects students at different schools. We also want to hear how COVID-19 has affected you. If you're interested, fill out this contact form, and a journalist from our team will contact you.   \n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdEkVdOvZRV\\_eghUhC2oeex\\_vmC2Sqo18WmH500mjPAapDYOQ/viewform?fbclid=IwAR2pFs7-aRvuZr8FNNQmmDVT4hPqGUzPIJ8izgx1cHVPVYc6JrGMX5NzmG4](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdEkVdOvZRV_eghUhC2oeex_vmC2Sqo18WmH500mjPAapDYOQ/viewform?fbclid=IwAR2pFs7-aRvuZr8FNNQmmDVT4hPqGUzPIJ8izgx1cHVPVYc6JrGMX5NzmG4)",

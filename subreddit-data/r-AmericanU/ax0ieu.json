            "comment": "Not an alum of the program, but I can talk about housing options. If you want to live near campus, be sure to avoid the really close ones since they're beyond overpriced. That includes the Avalon, Berkshire, and Greenbriar. I've seen better process for places in Glover Park (30 minutes walking from campus) or Cleveland Park (about the same time walking or so). The management company I've had experience with is Bernstein Management, and their properties are decently priced. Idaho Terrace near campus isn't bad. ",

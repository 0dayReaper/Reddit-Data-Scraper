    "postText": "Is anyone here in the PPL program at American? I was accepted and it seems like a great opportunity, but I\u2019m unsure of whether I would like to attend. I\u2019m interested in potentially double majoring in comp sci and I\u2019m not sure if it would be possible in this program. I\u2019m also hoping to apply to law school after undergrad and don\u2019t know whether this program would help or hurt me. Any guidance would be much appreciated!",

I definitely think it would help in regards to law school because of all the internship opportunities and the classes( I also plan on going to law school). I\u2019m not sure if double majoring is possible with this program, I would email the school.",

Most students in apartments provided through AU don\u2019t use campus except for classes. My roommate and I would prefer to just self-quarantine here until May. It\u2019s actually more disruptive to our routines *and our health* to force us to move our furniture and everything else back home as though we were in on-campus dorms with a meal plan. \n\nSo. Frustrating.",

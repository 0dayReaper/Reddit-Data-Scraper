    "postText": "I\u2019m a potential undergraduate student. I was accepted into the college of arts and sciences at American, but I have really decided that I would be more interested in studying in the school of public affairs. I was wondering if anyone with experience in transferring between schools at American could tell me how easy that process was. Is it possible for me to request to transfer schools before fall semester, or do I have to wait?",

Everyone has to complete the same core/habits of mind/what ever they call it now. Taking classes between them is also no different than taking a class within your own school.\n\nIt is nothing like other universities, which might require applications to transfer between schools and have vastly different requirements.\n\nReally a great thing about AU is how easy it is to change majors.",

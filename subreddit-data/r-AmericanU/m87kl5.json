    "postText": "hey everyone, I was waitlisted for RD which has been a bummer since American is my top choice, and I was wondering if any current students can reach out to me. To accept the offer I have to talk about why I want to be on campus in the fall, I\u2019m aware this is asking a lot but I want to respond as best as possible and it would be wonderful if someone can reach out and talk more about what sets American from other schools! Also, does anyone know what my chance of getting off the waitlist is? If there\u2019s no chance I think I just need to accept my fate",

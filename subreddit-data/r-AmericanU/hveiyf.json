    "postText": "I just got accepted into American for Fall 2020. I know that American offers housing for transfers, but I\u2019m curious on what the smartest decision would be for me. I\u2019m going in as a 3rd year, and I live a few hours away from campus. Due to COVID-19, I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019ll be better for me to stay home and take classes all online or move to DC and live off-campus? I\u2019m not opposed to either option, but I wanna know what others may think.",

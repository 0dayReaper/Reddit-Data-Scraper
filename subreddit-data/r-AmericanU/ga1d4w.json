Even though you somehow managed to land a job with IR, that is if you land a job, the pay is not good at all you\u2019d be lucky if you get paid close to 40k a year. \n\nThat is unless, If your family is wealthy and you wonMt graduate with student loans, and you really, really want to be in DC and only got into AU/GW, then it\u2019s worth a shot.",

But a lifetime of debt, without actually working in the field is certainly irrational and not \u201cworth it\u201d in any practical sense. (Context: graduated in the recession and transitioned to software development because i actually needed to earn a living.)",

My annual tuition was 5K per year (without aid), and it is still pretty reasonable. You could do a full four years at a CUNY or SUNY school for the cost of one year at AU.\n\nI wanted to go to Columbia but simply could not afford it and glad I didn\u2019t take on debt to do so. \n\nWith just a BA in IR, your job prospects are fairly limited, and it seems that most people that are successful in pursuing a long-term career do a master\u2019s degree or even a Phd. \n\nOf my classmates that graduated around the same time between 2005-2007, the ones that work at the state department or UN all went on to complete master\u2019s degrees. I have another friend that is a now professor after completing his Phd. \n\nI think the smart play is to go to a low cost option for the 4 year BA and then \u201cupgrade\u201d for the MA/Msc by going to an Ivy or other prestigious school. In the UK you can knock out an Msc/MA in 1 year, and this is an option in Europe and other parts of Asia like Hong Kong. \n\nI did well with my international studies degree in the private sector and landed a job overseas, but I speak a second language. I work in communications and public affairs and the IR and language coursework was quite applicable. I completed a masters in an adjacent field about ten years after earning the BA and I\u2019m now doing even better. Did my MA overseas and knocked it out in 12 months. (kind of a nightmare but doable)\n\nJust be aware that your ROI on 200K BA in IR simply may not be very good unless you are very driven. You\u2019ll need to pursue all possible internships, most likely need to do a masters and even then will be competing for a handful of positions. \n\nI\u2019d say the vast majority, probably 80% of my cohort, do not work in the field or an area that is adjacent to the degree. The ones that were successful all worked very hard and at the end of the day had no problem moving into great positions with a degree from a lesser known public school. Many of them earned advanced degrees on scholarships or fellowships, and often at great schools.",

Try to get as much aid and apply for any scholarship you can. \n\nEveryone's financial situation is different and I'm not going to pretend I know what is best for you. The fact that you are aware and thinking about the repercussions is a good sign. If you are smart and don't live beyond your means, you may be able to pay down the debt quicker than you think.

    "postText": "I am considering applying to this program and would like to talk to those familiar with the program. If so I have a few questions, most pressing are: \n\n1. Did you find the program put either you or those you know in a good working position upon graduating? \n\n2. Is the program worth the potential debt you or those you know took on? \n\n3. Did you find you learned a great deal about journalism and video production on the international scale? \n\nThank you in advance and please feel free to PM me if you have anything specific thoughts about the program outside this thread!

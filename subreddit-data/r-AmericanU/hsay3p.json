I think I'll go into either Political Science, French or something in the Department of Justice, Law and Criminology. I would love to know what these programs are like as well as general thoughts on the university. Thanks!",

If you want to go to criminal justice, the next leg up is law enforcement, or law school more or less.  \n\nAlso, take a look at GW, they were my next choice and I probalby should have gone there.  That being said, I loved AU.  Again, I was there in the 90s",

            "comment": "I loved my experience at AU! I majored in international studies and learned two languages but took advantage of many opportunities outside of SIS -- opportunities like interning at The World Bank, winning the American University Concerto and Aria Competition, making my piano concerto soloist debut with the American University Symphony Orchestra, studying abroad at an elite conservatory in Vienna, Austria, being published a dozen times in the university alumni magazine, or taking over the AU Instagram page four-times. \n\nThat's not even to mention the academic opportunities. Classes of mine regularly had presidential candidates, fortune 500 CEOs, foreign ministers, and the president of USAID to speak \u2014 and not as a 'thing,' just casually. \n\nThere are probably 120+ clubs, and all the ones I joined led me to niches of friends and opportunities that I wouldn't have had otherwise. Student life is very open-ended, meaning if you're into cheering-on our sports teams or partying, that definitely exists. If you're into interning or joining a club, that definitely exists. If you're into venturing out into the city and everything it has to offer, the national mall is 30 minutes away from the quad when the shuttles and metro are running well. \n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any questions about AU or otherwise (@teddyc212 on Instagram). Here are some of my photos of campus to seduce you into further considering AU: [AU Campus Photos](https://thchaffman.smugmug.com/AU-Campus-Zoom-Backgrounds) \u270c\ufe0f\ud83e\udd85",

If AU had space on the main campus I'm sure it'd be there.\n\nOP is from out of state and out of country, if there is no reason for them to be in DC specifically, there are better law school options",

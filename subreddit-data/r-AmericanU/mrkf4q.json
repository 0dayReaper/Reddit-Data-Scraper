It's an indispensable way to make lifelong friends and you quickly become acquainted acquainted the campus and get help on how to manage college. You have program leaders in the seminar that help you out and they're always amazing. \n\nI hope this helps. Feel free to comment/message with more Qs",

You'll meet plenty of people other ways and with some majors that don't give you a lot of room for electives it can take up valuable credit space.  I'm sure for some people it was an excellent experience but I think for most it was pretty forgettable",

Some folks get the connection to the university elsewhere like clubs or sports, but UC can't be better for a new college student who is a bit nervous about how to get involved. It's free, you get tons of opportunities, and all the stuff i listed above.",

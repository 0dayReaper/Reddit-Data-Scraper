    "postText": "Hey, my name is Daniel, i\u2019m from Moscow and currently a junior at Michigan State. I came to Washington DC for a day (had stuff to do at the embassy), it was a super spontaneous decision, they called me yesterday and said they had an open spot. So here I am, alone, stanky after 10 hour drive (I brushed my teeth, don\u2019t worry) and have nothing to do for tonight. Basically, I am looking for several things here:\n1) A company for tonight, it would be cool if you can show me your city and some nice local spots.\n2) I am literally willing to pay you to use your shower, or if that\u2019s an option to stay overnight (i even brought an inflatable mattress)\n3) I know it\u2019s a finals szn, so I assume y\u2019all are busy af rn. So, any recommendations what should I visit? I am planning to stay here until 2am.\n\nHere\u2019s my Instagram, shoot me a DM if you\u2019re interested :)\n\n[IG](https://instagram.com/assk1ng?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=)",

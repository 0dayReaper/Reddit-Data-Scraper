Greek life is active with about 30% of the university in a frat or sorority. There are about 10 frats and the best are Sigma Chi, SAE, and Sig ep. The rest aren't worth it. The houses are off-campus and most frats have multiple and they are usually a 10-20 minute walk away. Clubs don't party. A third of the school is in Greek life and it helps a lot socially but its not a state school.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone, I'm coming on here to ask if anyone has gone through a similar situation and what they have done. American is my top choice school but my attendance is based on financial aid. I got no merit aid and not enough financial aid for me to able to attend. I appealed for another evaluation of my merit aid and got nothing. I emailed the Financial Aid department and they got back to me 12 hours before the deadline to submit additional documents to prove I actually need the money (which my parents requested an extension for tax papers, so I wouldn't have access to those papers anyways). Has anyone gone to American anyways in hopes that they would get more money for good grades in college or have applied for some specific scholarships at American that have made it possible to attend? Or anything else?\n\nThank you in advance everyone :D",

DC isn\u2019t inexpensive to live in either, even if your financial aid gets beefed up. A lot of AU kids will come from money and the social pressure to keep up can be hard (eating out, going to bars, taking unpaid internships instead working, nice clothes, etc). Attending AU could still be great for you, and I hope they make the financial aid work for you, but a financial setback this early in your life could set you back more than you realize, and a different school might set you up for quicker success. As you might be able to tell, I have mixed thoughts about my own decision to attend AU. Some of the best things in my life came from attending, but it was pricier than anticipated, even with pretty good looking financial aid (on paper), and I can\u2019t help but think that I might have avoided a lot of financial stress in life (and feeling poor and living paycheck to paycheck is stressful) if I\u2019d made a different choice.",

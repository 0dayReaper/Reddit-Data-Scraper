            "comment": "I took govt-110 with Patricia Sykes, she heavily stressed doing the reading which I never did. (I did however read the chapters from the textbook just not the assigned readings, they were too long for me and uninteresting.) Sykes wasn't really that enjoyable as the midterm and final are 90% of your total grade. I took her spring 2020 and she only assigned readings once covid hit she did take a long time to grade the tests without any feedback however her mother did die of covid so I'll cut her some slack. I did however take bachiyska for govt-130 who also teaches govt-110 and she was such a great professor that I plan of taking her for govt 235. Unfortunately I cannot seem to remember the name of the textbook but I'm sure they're all similar. And that's my 2 cents!",

I\u2019m not sure what specifically GOVT 110 is, but for most of the intro govt and JLC classes I took, we just read different philosophers so there was no traditional textbook. If the course name sounds any but related to principles/morality/philosophy, there\u2019s a really good chance you won\u2019t be using a textbook and the prof may just provide PDFs scanned from their own books!",

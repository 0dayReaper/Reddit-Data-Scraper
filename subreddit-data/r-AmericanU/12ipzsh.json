Idk if there is a single affordable apartment that doesn\u2019t have the common issues of sketch/rats/cockroaches/bad utilities etc. If the price is right then it is probably comparable to apartments anywhere else; prices are just too ridiculously high to expect somewhat decent housing for less that a pretty penny.",

    "postText": "Hi there! I am looking to attend SIS for my MA in International Affairs focusing on US National Security and Foreign Policy. AU's program is pretty much my dream and I was curious about what the realistic chances of me getting accepted were. I will need financial aid as I've been financially independent pretty much from the minute I graduated from undergrad.\n\nMy resume basically lines up like:\n\n- University at Albany: Cum Laude degree in Political Science specializing in Global Politics\n- 3.26 overall, 3.42 major GPA\n- Year of study abroad experience at the University of Nottingham, UK\n- Year of work in NY state politics\n- Year of internship experience with Congressperson\n- Secured 2 letters of recommendation already\n- Taking the GRE in November, aiming for 160 verbal/math\n\nI'd be looking to take night classes as I am going to have to work to support myself and pay for school. I'm looking in Alexandria right now but I don't know how hectic that commute would be. I've been on the campus twice and fell in love with it more each time, so this is really my target. \n\nReally trying to gauge what my realistic chances are and what people who have studied at SIS think about it. Any assistance or just general comments about SIS/coming in as an MA candidate would be great. Thanks!",

Your GPA is kind of low, but that can be made up for with things such as a strong resume, great letters of recommendation, and a great essay. Also, if you want to go to sis, be prepared to take out loans. ",

My two letters are both from professors who know me and the type of student I am very well. I also am not deep in debt from undergrad, so I have no issue with loans. Thanks for your help.",

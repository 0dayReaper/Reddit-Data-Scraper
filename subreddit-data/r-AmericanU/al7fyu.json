    "postText": "Has anyone here had experience in using the LSAC's Credential Assembly Service to compile and submit their undergraduate transcripts to law schools? I'm trying to do so now, but running up against some issues related to the way AU seems to prefer to supply transcripts. AU uses Parchment to send transcripts, but has a unique site tied in to that service, rather than using the Parchment site itself. AU's site requires you to provide an email for electronic submissions, but the CAS will not accept transcripts sent by email. It does take transcripts sent via Parchment, but AU's use of its own site seems to prohibit that (Parchment redirects you to AU's site when you try to send AU transcripts).\n\nI'm just wondering if anyone has any experience here. It seems like there should be a workaround to allow online transcripts to be sent, and it's not like I'm the first AU undergrad to apply to law school. I'm going to call the registrar's office tomorrow, but I'm guessing they're done for the day due to weather.\n\n(I posted this earlier to /r/americanuniversity without realizing that this sub existed, so apologies for the spammy posts.)\n\nEDIT: Apparently there is no workaround to submit the transcripts electronically.  You have to request the transcripts be physically mailed, and upload a copy of the cover sheet via AU's Parchment portal.  Oh well.",

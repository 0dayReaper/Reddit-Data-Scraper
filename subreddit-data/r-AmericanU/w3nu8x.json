These include concerns about the availability of financial aid for ED students; timing of notification of these awards; and whether or not they should even apply ED if financial aid is a concern. American University is committed to supporting students who demonstrate financial need. Students who apply to AU under the Early Decision Plan are given consideration for need-based and merit award packages in the same manner as students who apply under our Regular Decision Plan. Our Early Decision candidates are notified at the point of admission of their financial aid awards and merit scholarships (if eligible). If American University is your first choice, we encourage you to apply Early Decision.\nEarly Decision I applicants who wish to be considered for need-based financial aid must complete and submit the CSS Profile form to the College Board and the FAFSA to the Department of Education by November 15. For Early Decision II applicants, the CSS Profile and FAFSA deadline is January 15.\u201d",

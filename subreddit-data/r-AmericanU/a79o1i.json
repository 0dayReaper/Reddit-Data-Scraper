    "postText": "Got accepted as a Spring Sophomore Transfer to SIS. Been wanting to go AU since high school, but never could afford till now. I listed some questions down below, it'll be awesome if everyone throw some wisdom at me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. How's SIS life? \n2. Clubs and social activities? (I am an Asian male from Southern Cali) \n3. Professional development? (Interested in rushing for DPE and getting an internship with my areas congressman)\n4. Are there Dorms for transfers or will they put me in a Sophomore dorm? \n5. Are classes easy to get and how do semesters feel? ( I'm transferring from a public state school with a quarter system)\n6. Is bringing a car viable? (I need it a weekly commute to Howard University for a work-internship)\n7. Do you feel happy going to AU?",

Also, figure out how many Lyfts/Ubers you can take in a pinch for the cost of keeping a car (don't forget insurance, gas, parking, etc.)! But with a smartphone app (my fave DC Metro and Bus), public transportation becomes a very viable option.",

I'm a freshman, so I don't necessarily know \\~how SIS life is\\~, but what I've found is that it's like...really loose...? i dunno how to explain it, but I feel like a sense of camaraderie among SIS students really isn't there, which is unfortunate. Maybe it's different once you're a sophomore/junior/whatever\n\n5. I prefer the semester system to the quarter system, but that may just be me. and of course, the rigor of courses depends on your professor.\n\n6. Transfers get the U-pass don't they? You can take the Metro to Howard I believe. Honestly I wouldn't bring a car but like, if you want I'm sure it'd be ok as long as you can swing the parking price \ud83d\ude29\n\nCongrats and good luck next sem man!!",

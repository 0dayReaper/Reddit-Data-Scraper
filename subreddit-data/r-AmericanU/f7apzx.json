    "postText": "Hello! I was offered admission for an MA program and I might probably take it. So I\u2019ve been looking at rentals, since I believe there\u2019s no on campus housing for graduates. I wanted to see if there was any advice, any Facebook groups that I could look at for my rental search. Ideally I would use public transportation to move around, since I\u2019m moving from outside of the states to attend, and won\u2019t have a car with me. \n\nThank you for anything in advance!",

            "comment": "This sort of thing isn\u2019t unique to AU. It happens at lots of colleges, and AU isn\u2019t nearly as bad as some of be bigger public universities. \n\nTo add to what\u2019s been posted, AU gives registration priority to students with learning disabilities. \n\nThere has been a huge increase in the percent of students entering college who register their learning disabilities and receive accommodations, which can include priority class scheduling. So this may be another reason for your problems. \n\n\nIf you\u2019re an incoming student at AU, just assume you\u2019re not going to get the schedule exactly like you want it. You\u2019re at the bottom of the pecking order, so you\u2019ve just got to make do. The more credits you have, the more priority you get. \n\nThere\u2019s usually a reason for a course to have a crazy weight list. Students will know which courses and teachers are easiest, so it\u2019s common for some of the easiest and most desirable courses to be almost impossible to get into as an underclassman.\n\nThe weight list hassle gets easier every semester. Nothing to worry about. ",

Several departments have established rating rules for some of their sections, which means in some cases upperclassmen or majors may automatically move to the head of the waitlist, therefore changing your position on the waitlist.\n\n\n\nAlso,\n\n&gt;It's extremely frustrating.\n\nWelcome to AU's bureaucracy! Enjoy the next 4 years, it only gets worse! ",

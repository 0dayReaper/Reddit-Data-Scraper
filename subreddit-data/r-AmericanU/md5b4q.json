    "postText": "Hello Everyone!\n\nI am taking an Intro to Psychology class this semester, and part of that class requires conducting a survey. My group and I have decided to conduct a survey on the relationship between dogs and happiness on American University students. If you are an American University student, I would greatly appreciate you filling out this survey! You can find a link [here](https://american.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bORMFYAiBwYJrFk) to do so! The whole process should take between six to nine minutes, and your responses will not be individually shared - only as part of the aggregate of the whole sample. The first page of the survey is the consent form which will explain the survey in more detail. Thank you in advance!\n\nu/mklipka \n\nAt this moment, the survey is ONLY for current American University students.",

I heard about the school being populated mostly with millionaires in previous posts which was surprising since they gave me a full tuition grant.",

If you're worried about not keeping up with your friends, just make sure you create a budget and stick to it. DC has plenty of cheaper/free things to do, is way more walkable than you might think, and the bus can be a lot cheaper than the metro if you do need public transit.",

My family is pretty firmly middle class, I got a bit of money from AU on a scholarship and so do lots of their students, so that allows more economic diversity. \n\nThat being said, DC is a fairly expensive city. I was working at least 2 jobs my whole time at school, but thankfully they were both flexible with hours so I was able to still go to class/hang with friends",

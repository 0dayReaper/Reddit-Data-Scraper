It's a bit further down Massachusetts than the Berks and the Avalon, so it's probably about a 15 minute walk to AU (but it's a lovely, safe walk!). I lived there for \\~4 years in a studio and then a 1BR. The prices were really fair (I paid $1.3k for a studio then, looks like prices have increased a bit to $1.4k or so; and a 1BR for $1.8k.). The building is very quiet (thick walls - great for studying), has storage units for rent in the basement for fairly cheap, a bike room, a small gym, package pick-up room. The apartment complex is about a 7 minute walk to Cathedral Commons which has a host of fitness boutiques as well as a Giant. The area also has some decent restaurants. Highly highly highly recommend Idaho Terrace.",

My biggest thing is that I want a studio and to be close to campus. (just got kicked out of upperclassmen housing bc of the fall plans :( )  I'm fine with walking during the daytime, but is it uncomfortable at night, is the bus reliable if you need it?? Thanks so much!!!",

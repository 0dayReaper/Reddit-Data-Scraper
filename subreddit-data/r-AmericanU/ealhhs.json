There\u2019s a game lab at AU actually. \n\nIt\u2019s small which allows you a lot of one-on-ones with your professor, which you can\u2019t do in a lot of schools. \n\nI personally know AU Comp Sci alums working at Facebook &amp; Amazon right now so I\u2019d say in the end it\u2019s what you make of it.",

Comp sci, imo, is always going to be what you make of it since a fundamental part of it is self-taught. You can easily get a lot of 1 on 1 time with the Professors here, though, which is nice if you can take advantage of that. \n\nI'd suggest getting a look at many different schools before making a decision, and really solidify the criteria behind what you want to see from your 4-year college",

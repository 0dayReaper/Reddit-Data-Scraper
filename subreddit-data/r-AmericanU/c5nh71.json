    "postText": "G'day, Australian here from Melbourne Uni.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHas anyone done the additional year of study at American University after a Masters of International Relations at UniMelb, which earns another masters, the Masters of International Service? It's a partnership program offered by both universities. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf so, was it worth it? What's AU like? Is it considered a good university in the States? What's the campus culture like? Dorms, food, sports etc? Is Washington really expensive? Employment prospects after graduation?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny general thoughts, advice, experiences of American University or the Master of Int. Service would be awesome.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers!",

            "comment": "I\u2019m currently in PPL and am about to graduate. I\u2019ve enjoyed my time with it so far. The main benefits are the cohort and the connections with certain professors. I also got to do a PPL/SIS study abroad opportunity for 3-year students (however, there were normal 4 year students who also got to go). You also get to take a few classes with some profs that are heavily sought after. Plus, you do a capstone research project during the second semester of your senior year on a topic of your choosing (it technically has to be PPL related but the prof is very lenient, mine is on food insecurity). Note: normal 4 year students do a similar capstone but slightly different, depends on your major)\n\nSince I was planning on graduating in 3 years anyway, and wanted to major in CLEG (a solid amount of people, even those not in PPL, tend to graduate in 3 years) I had nothing to lose by doing PPL. However, if you expect to take 4 years, DO NOT DO PPL! If you want to do 4 years, it\u2019s honestly not worth it since the benefits of PPL are kinda marginal tbh. You can get many of the same benefits (connections, good profs, etc.) without PPL if you put in the work.\n\nFurthermore, if you don\u2019t want to do the one of the majors that PPL forces you into, DO NOT DO PPL!\n\nTbh, I kinda regret not doing 4 years since 3 years feels rushed in that I am graduating with less internships, experiences, etc. than my peers with 4 years. However, it wasn\u2019t really my choice since I came into AU with a lot of credits, and would\u2019ve graduated in 3 years anyway.\n\nTLDR: Do PPL if you expect to graduate in 3 years (coming into AU with credits, or okay with taking 2-3 summer classes) and like the majors they have to offer. don\u2019t do PPL if you want to graduate in 4 years or don\u2019t want to major in CLEG or Legal Studies.",

She\u2019s currently on maternity leave but I imagine that she\u2019ll be back for the fall. She\u2019s great and can answer a lot of your questions, and she\u2019ll be a good connection and she\u2019s super approachable. If you decide to join PPL for the first semester or two to see if you like it, I would keep in touch with her and drop by her office hours. I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019ll be teaching your first or second PPL cohort class so you\u2019ll get to know her.",

I did the combined MPA program at AU too partly because I wanted a 4th year. I\u2019d agree the benefits are marginal, but it\u2019s also a great way to make friends and find a community, as well as get access to a lot of great professors. Employers have been impressed by it and it can be helpful as a display of your work ethic in interviews/grad school apps. I actually talked about it a lot in an interview for a great paid internship I got in senior year, so I\u2019d say it\u2019s helped open some doors for me. I\u2019d just say be certain you want to do college in 3 years.",

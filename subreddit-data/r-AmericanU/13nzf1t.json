    "postText": "One thing that has been a hot topic on this usually slow sub has been the high acceptance rates along with the higher class sizes. Most people assume Burwell just wants more tuition dollars, and I don\u2019t necessarily disagree with that assessment. However, I also know that Georgetown and GW are both much more popular than AU and that has only increased with time. Maybe the high acceptance rates are due to a low yield each year? One thing\u2019s for certain: No one is lining up to attend AU.",

            "comment": "Our yield is virtually the same as GW (3% difference in grad rate). And the high acceptance rate was for one year (class of 2025) which was because of the pandemic causing low enrollment in the class of 2024. GW experienced the same thing. AU acceptance rates for class of 2026 and 2027 were in the 40s, similar to how they were pre-pandemic.",

I'm an undergraduate third-year student, but the zoom/blackboard voice chats have brought out a lot more voices than the in-person classes themselves did. I think a lot of students have public-speaking fears that have been encouraged by social-media use and more, so these formats have brought some voices to my classes that we would have never heard in person.\n\nIt's interesting to consider, imo.",

They\u2019ve not had the same \u201cexperience\u201d, but the credit toward the degree is still worth the same. Given that your degree will not have a COVID-19 online class asterisk on it, it is the exact same degree, and therefore will cost the same. The university has opted to offer a discount for summer courses as all of them have gone online. This is largely to sweeten the deal for students, but no court will find that the university has an obligation to reduce the cost. Credit hours cost the same regardless of how you get them.",

The random mutation of a virus into a form that was this dangerous is not the university's fault.  \n\nAnd yes, I am a student too, and while I am a bit sad the semester didn't proceed as planned, I appreciate that my school moved to keep me safe, that my professors, with very little notice or time, managed to adapt my courses to an online format.  I'm also worried about fall, and I am saddened by the layoffs, furloughs, and salary cuts taking place on my campus.  Realistically, even if it opens this fall, I expect it to return to a very different campus.  Students suing should be ashamed of themselves and think about finding ways to be a positive force during this tragic time, instead of adding to the misery.",

They paid for something with certain expectations, got a much different service, and the universities by and large are refusing to negotiate at all. Student's personal finances *should* come before consideration of other people's salaries/jobs, especially when many students are in the position of needing to borrow money to attend school. If tuition was a small amount, I could see little reason to get up in arms, but most students/families are not able to be so cavalier with a yearly tuition that could put a downpayment on a house.",

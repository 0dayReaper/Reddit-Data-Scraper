    "postText": "I was a little surprised when I got waitlisted from American University about a month ago, and was disappointed when I realized from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmericanU/comments/87djyc/waitlist_chances/) that in 2017 0 people got accepted to AU from the waitlist out of over 500 that applied to be on it. With this in mind, I was basically sure that I wouldn't get accepted so was pleasantly surprised when I actually got accepted yesterday. \n\nI'm still determining whether to go to AU because the financial aid is... minimal. However, I'm wondering if any of you know other people who got accepted off of the waitlist this year, and whether anyone on this subreddit got accepted off of the waitlist in past years and decided go to AU, and if so why? \n\nI'm super excited about considering AU, thanks guys!",

    "postText": "hi! i'm a prospective student, and i was curious if anyone here could share about their experiences in the AU Honors program or Politics, Policy and Law Scholars. Is going honors worth it? are honors kids pretty separated from the rest of the school? for PPL, has going on track to graduate in 3 years made it difficult to balance work/internships?  thank you for any insight! :)",

            "comment": "PPL grad here. One of the most helpful things for most people in my class was AP/IB credits. I came in with most of a year\u2019s worth and my class load was fairly normal, although I did take two summer courses after freshman year. Others I know did definitely have to stack up on classes a bit and it\u2019s already difficult to do college plus work or an internship. I know a lot of people can\u2019t afford to not work their first year or two of college, but if it\u2019s an option and you wanted to do PPL or another 3 year program, I would suggest it. Otherwise, do be aware that it can be a little tough, but doable.\n\nAnother thing I\u2019ll add about PPL is that I did feel separated from others on campus. Because we lived together freshman year, almost all of my friends ended up being 3 year program people. That\u2019s not a bad thing, and you\u2019ll hopefully develop good relationships with those in your cohort, but it can feel a bit isolating from the rest of campus. I highly recommend joining clubs and finding people outside of your cohort bubble.\n\nThe last thing I\u2019ll mention is that I would really recommend thinking about whether or not you want to do college in 3 years. PPL is a great program with great professors, but myself and others have often had thoughts that we did it all too fast. There\u2019s a trade-off involved and it\u2019s a decision you\u2019ll really want to think through.\n\nI\u2019m happy to answer other questions about PPL/3 year programs if I can answer them. Feel free to DM if you wanted to talk more in-depth.",

My understanding is that even if you're Honors, you'll still be integrated into some classes w everybody else. I have a friend doing Global Scholars and ik he's disappointed about only having 2 years of on-campus experience (bc of covid taking our freshman year).",

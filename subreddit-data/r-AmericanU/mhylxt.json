    "postText": "Hi there! I was wondering what y'all would think about my chances of getting in, especially as a transfer. AU is pretty much the only school I want to go to (and I feel like I made that pretty clear in my application) so I was curious what you guys think my chances are? \n\nI'm probably going to take this all with a grain of salt since when I applied to college in high school, I was told I wasn't going to get into most of my schools and then ended up getting into almost all of them (I had a super low GPA and average test scores, but I always tend to have strong ECs and essays which helps). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDemographics: Multiracial, female, upper-middle-class, transfer student from local CC \n\nHooks: URM? (mixed with two minority groups, not sure if that counts) \n\nIncome: 300k+ (I think)  \n\nComing from: Did one year at a large state school across the country, then one year at community college while I decided what I wanted to do in terms of schooling \n\nMajor: Psychology \n\nCredits: I think about 48-ish \n\nGPA: 3.0 (Low, but valid explanation with an upward trend once the hurdle was removed. Talked about this in my personal statement) \n\nECs: club officer, member of other clubs, volunteer work, 30 hr/wk job,\n\nRec: Got a recommendation from a professor who went to AU and seems to like me quite a good amount, not sure what it will actually come out like \n\nEssay: Super detailed, lots of demonstrated interest in all parts of the school, references to AU being my top school\n\nThank you so much! :)",

Granted I sent them a substantial work history/resume.\n\nI think you have a greater than decent shot as long as you get all your required documents in time, show that you can afford AU, apply to the arts and science school as they are trying to become more of a research school",

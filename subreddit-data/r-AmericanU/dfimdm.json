We are reaching out to students all around the world to see what a day in the life is like for students at different schools. This week, we\u2019re focusing on Boston University. \n\nThe project would involve **taking 15 to 20 photos of your life at American** and submitting them, along with brief descriptions.\n\nDo you know of any hidden gems or strange places on campus that deserve more attention? Do you often find yourself caught in funny or unexpected situations? Do you know of any scandals or bad behavior on campus? Are you a regular at some of the school's wildest parties? Is there something that bothers you at the school that you wish could get addressed? If you can answer yes to any of these, we\u2019d love to hear from you.\n\nPlease reach out if you have a compelling story idea about college that you think could be told through a photo series. We are **offering $160 to anyone we decide to publish** and we are open to keeping these anonymous if necessary. Hope to hear from y\u2019all. Thanks!\n\n(Please email or text me if you\u2019re interested)\n\nMack DeGeurin\n\nmdegeurin@businessinsider.com\n\n(713) 898 5780",

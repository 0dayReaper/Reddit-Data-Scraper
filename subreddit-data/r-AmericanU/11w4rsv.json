    "postText": "So I am considering schools based, on aid, acceptance rate, and some other things. For this school however the numbers are not adding up. On google (USNEWS) the acceptance rate is 64% on their website it gave a 31% rate and on the admissions letter it says over 19,000 people applied for 2,000 seats which gives about a 10.5% acceptance rate.  \nCould someone clarify what the actual value is?",

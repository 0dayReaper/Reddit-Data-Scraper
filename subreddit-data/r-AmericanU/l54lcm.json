My experience was the profs did a really good job of teaching practical job skills like writing press releases or learning different computer programs, and seemed to focus on helping students get internships that interested them and would help them network well while job hunting post graduate. I\u2019d recommend the program.",

I would be careful with ensuring your degree transfers entirely so that you are not stuck with having to take unnecessary courses. My degree was given to SOC late for some reason and it caused some issues but they were great in assisting the issue. The professors are fantastic. There are tons of opportunities for job fairs and getting internship emails.",

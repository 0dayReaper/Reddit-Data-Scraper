I tend to use a mix of both (laptop or a notebook) to take notes; physically writing them tends to help me remember the material better. Personal preference at the end of the day as well.",

I could personally never focus with a computer in front of me, no matter how much I wanted to or how much I said I needed to focus.\n\nYou might be fine in intro classes (I was), but when you get to your real classes you\u2019re gonna wish you\u2019d gotten used to taking paper notes imo. You\u2019ve also got the added benefit that no professor will ban paper notes, so you\u2019ll have consistency through your classes.",

My handwriting is pretty bad, and I type a lot faster than I write, so my laptop notes are always neat, thorough, and most importantly, **super organized**. I also keep literally everything for my classes on google docs so I can open it up and study at any time or reorganize/copy-paste the notes at any time. You can't do this with paper and pen. My organized laptop notes for classes were always more helpful to me than paper notes. Also, most profs are amenable to letting you use a laptop if you just talk to them and explain that ur preferred form of notetaking.",

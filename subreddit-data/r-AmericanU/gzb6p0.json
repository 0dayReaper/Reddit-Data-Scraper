I would love to know what these programs are like if you have experience, and if not I also would like to know what your general thoughts are on the university.",

I presented in 2 research conferences and wrote a senior thesis.\n\nI participated in rogue lesbianism, long distance relationship (freshman year-big mistake), and converted people to Acid, while maintaining a 3.8 GPA.\n\nAlso commuting takes a long time, so when I moved to Columbia Heights there was like 40min-3hrs of time spend getting to and from campus lol\n\nSo yeah. I did my own thing with basically the crowd for 4 years, and it was great.\n\nOther people did college differently, but I liked my way. \nUnlike my friends, I dont have very many \"wish I had's....\" \nI took school seriously while not taking life too seriously and it worked out.\nMy only regrets are relationship based \n(could have had more fun if I hadn't been worried about maintaining toxic intimate relationships because \"love\")\n\nSchool is priority, everything else is a distraction. Dont isolate yourself, but if socialization gets in the way of you making good grades, you're not ready for AU or any other college.",

Highly recommend Lauren Weis (I took 4 courses with her!), as well as Jin Park, Andrea Tschemplik, Mark Schaefer (he's the Methodist leader at AU and teaches RELG courses but there's a lot of cross pollination with the PHIL major), and Gershon Greenberg. \n\nMy husband (also C/O '13) was a PHIL major. We both really enjoyed our time both at AU (it's where we met!) and in the department. Lauren Weis is one of the best teachers either of us has ever had! \n\nI loved my courses:\n\nWestern philosophy (the one that got me hooked)\n\nMoral philosophy \n\nIntro to logic \n\nAsian philosophy \n\nTheories of democracy \n\nCritical bioethics \n\nChinese philosophy \n\nGender, body, and society  \n\nForms of the sacred \n\nThe biological body \n\nReligious heritage of the west \n\nNon-western religious traditions",

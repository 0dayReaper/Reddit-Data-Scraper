For those who have been commuting to this school what are some of the pros and cons that you\u2019ve experienced? Would you recommend a prospective student to choose commute life over living on campus? (p.s I live in VA)",

I don\u2019t know why I thought I needed to drive my first semester, but it ended up being a fortune.",

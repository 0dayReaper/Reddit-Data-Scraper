The people here are all very rude and unfriendly, I'm from New England and I still consider the majority of people here as unkind. The schools preach that everyone here is so nice but in reality, they are a bunch of snobs who think they know everything. The dorms suck considering how much the room and board fees are. The professors are either helpful or not, no in-between, and can be very unsympathetic. The tuition has no reason to be this high because every time you go and get help from one of the many \"spectacular\" resources they offer you, they are too busy for you or are useless, frankly. Honestly, I've only been here for three months and I cannot wait to graduate already.",

I am the only black person in most of my classes (sometimes only POC) and because of the low number of minorities (POC) that make up the student body I personally feel like if you don't live close to them or participate in classes or activities with them then it may be hard to find people like you. Thankfully I have a few friends in my classes, friends of friends that I've met and some people that do cheer with me so I was able to find POC more specifically black people. At first it was a hard adjustment and I feel like if I was any less outgoing I'd have little to no POC friends which is kinda scary. I wish the school did a slightly better job in conveying that but they obviously want to maintain their \"inclusive\" image.",

Before I make my decision I just wanted to know everyone\u2019s thoughts/opinions. For example, if you could tell me what you think about the classes, curriculum, faculty, etc.",

AU does really well with International Relations related to national security, international development, and international commerce. I know many people  go on to positions at the State Department, Think Tanks, contractors, private industry, or consulting of some kind. \n\nI would say that it's not necessarily going to fall out of the sky though. There's still a bit of legwork needed to do well.\n\nNYU's program will probably be a bit more focused on international business and nonprofits. It's likely that some government opportunities will still be open to you, but you wouldn't have the opportunity to say, intern at an international development firm doing USAID contracts and be offered a full time position after graduation. \n\nFeel free to PM me if you'd like more info/job advice.",

Hello all my relatives.\n\nI am an Anishinaabe--specifically, Ojibwe--Native American student from the midwest, and am currently looking at the prospect of continuing my four-year undergrad education at American this fall.\n\nHowever, I haven't seemed to find or connect with anyone in the native community regarding American. Could anyone tell me--preferably a Native student--what the experience is like being Native at AU? Both within your relationship to the institution and other relatives such as your professors, other students, and yourself/your the retainment of your culture on campus?\n\nIf you are not Native but would like to add something to this thread, could anyone tell me what programs the campus offers for Native students? Is there an American Indian Student Union etc.? I haven't found much online, but I may be looking in the wrong place.\n\nMiigwech!",

            "comment": "I can\u2019t say what being Native on campus is like bc I\u2019m not but AU is a predominantly white institution and it focuses it\u2019s conversations on race pretty heavily on black experiences. I think the closest I\u2019ve seen AU engage with Native issues was a land acknowledgment in an email. Once in two years. \n\nIn my (graduate) classes students don\u2019t seem to know anything about Native people and they tend to treat them as a monolith, though they\u2019re happy to learn more. It feels very odd advocating for more indigenous representation as a white girl in my classes, but since my girlfriend is Tsalagi (Cherokee), I tend to be the most knowledgeable on history and general trends. My professors aren\u2019t adverse to discussing Native issues, but most of them lack the knowledge to feel comfortable doing so. \n\nI know the Center for Diversity and Inclusion hosts some events for minorities on campus but from what I\u2019ve seen their emails tend to focus on LGBT people, women, and black people. I just filtered through the Engage system and found two Native orgs \u2014 one seemed very dead and the other has an Instagram @au_sanc that you could check out.",

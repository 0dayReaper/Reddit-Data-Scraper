    "postText": "Hi, I got accepted into CS for AU class of 2025 and went on a tour yesterday and they said that AU is starting to beef up their engineering and CS programs while being liberal arts campus. They said there are a lot of opportunities for research because it's a relatively small program that is growing. Is that the case? Is CS at AU great and have you enjoyed your time there? Thank you",

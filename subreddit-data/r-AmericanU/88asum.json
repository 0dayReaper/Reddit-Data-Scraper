To be fair, anywhere you go, you'll find people who might say they support minorities and disadvantaged groups, but when it comes to giving up something for them, you can't count on them doing so. \n\nhttps://thinkprogress.org/chick-fil-a-still-anti-gay-970f079bf85/\nLink for all the people who would still support Chick Fil A, and hey, if you want to be a garbage human being go ahead.

Some people might argue that if you're a nerd, it might be easier to find nerds in a school that's famous for majors like comp sci and engineering. But really, that might just be similar hobbies. There'll always be people with similar hobbies. \n\nFinding people that share your interests AND are people that you like being around is equally difficult/easy everywhere you go. But as long as you're out there, there's no way you won't find it. ",

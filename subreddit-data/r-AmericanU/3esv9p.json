    "postText": "AU is my top choice right now. I'm a rising senior in high school and I want to either go into political science or economics. Just a few general questions. \n\n1) AU is expensive. Really expensive. The average financial aid package isn't really all that great either (at least according to my research). Is the school really as expensive as it seems, or does the school help out to a certain degree? \n\n2) I've heard a lot about the CLEG program. It almost sounds too good to be true. Is it actually nationally recognized, and would you be able to go on to graduate school after having studied CLEG (for instance, would I be able to study economics in grad school after)?\n\n3) is the campus relatively safe? I get its DC, but I've heard that it's actually a pretty safe campus despite the big city. \n\nSorry if this is the wrong place to post this, just figured I'd get some info on the school from people who have firsthand experience at the school",

            "comment": "1. The short answer is yes. It's expensive. Very expensive. That being said the place I have seen AU not be really stingy on aid is merit based scholarships. Most of the people I know that are on those tell me they are quite generous. From my experience and the experience of others the need based scholarships are not as generous. \n\n2. Yes and Yes, though in this CLEG is not unique. As a general rule you can go on to most grad schools with almost any degree from any school as long as you do well in your undergrad years and get relevant work/intern experience during your time in college. CLEG is great mainly for the cross disciplinary approach offered by the program and its applicability in a future career in the government (it's kind of known as the government major). As far as I know it doesn't necessarily give you a leg up over people with other majors in applying to grad school. \n\n3. The campus is very safe, as is almost all of DC. I can't really think of issues that happen on campus that are due to the outside community, the majority of the issues that do appear are typical issues you see in colleges anywhere like theft and some instances of vandalizing. There are the most prevalent issues on campus, though like any college are not the only ones. DC at large is also a very safe city. While I am a white male, so my perspective may not be what other people have, I personally have little issue walking around the city at night alone, or going out to the national mall at 2am. Just stay out of Southeast (You litterally have no reason to go there anyway) and you will be fine. AU itself is in the safest section of the city, we are litterally surrounded my $1 million plus houses. \n",

While in my five years in DC (which obviously don't compare to your lifetime of growing up in the area) I have never made my way down to the house of Frederick Douglass, going to Eastern Market and the nearby areas (Barracks Row and Navy Yard), as well as some of the art shows in Anacostia have always been fun and interesting.\n\nAs I suppose I should clarify, I was mainly referring to that I wouldn't go east of the river late at night. While there are perfectly nice areas to go and stay (as enumerated by yourself above), there are also quite a few areas where I have certainly felt less than safe. \n\nSeriously, DC is so much more than our opinions! And again, thank you for your really polite and thoughtful input!  ",

There are many many areas of DC that are not safe for a young adult to walk alone at night. Most of them in NE, not SE. SE is very interesting and not all over the river, and saying you should never go there is completely stupid and outdated. Most of downtown and the mall is safe at night, but anywhere north and east of the Convention Center is a no go.",

I got a ton of financial aid, both merit and need-based, and came in with my own $24k per year scholarship. I graduated with about $35k in federal student loan debt. Honestly apply to a few places and then weigh the financials. I could have gone somewhere else (a good small liberal arts school) close to my hometown basically for free and I sometimes kick myself, but honestly I would not have had the same opportunities or ease gaining employment probably if I had gone there instead of AU.\n\n2) CLEG is well-regarded in the area and easy to explain outside of DC as an interdisciplinary major. You could definitely study econ in grad school later as long as you take enough econ and get good grades in those courses.\n\n3) Very safe, especially for a major city. Never felt unsafe, even at night.",

            "comment": "I graduated from AU a few years ago. I would advise being very wary about taking out a lot of loans to go to AU. Please apply to a range of schools that may give you scholarship options! Map out what loan payments would be and how much you end up paying in interest. My boyfriend has over $30,000 in loans, from a state school, that ends up being $50,000 all told with interest. He pays $500 a month for 10 years. CLEG- most likely- will not catapult you into a high paying job right out of undergrad. Ask AU to provide you examples of what CLEG alumni are doing. AU does provide a very important conduit to internships that may be worth the cost vs. a cheaper school that is not in a city, so as others have mentioned you will have to weigh costs / benefits. Consider starting at a state school and transferring in for Junior and Senior year to save money. A different experience, yes, but it could be worth it. \n\nAlso if you are weighing Political Science vs. Econ, I highly suggest focusing on a quant skill and supplementing with political science courses.  \n\nAU gave me $25k a year in scholarship, I had a pretty cookie cutter good student application. I am very privileged and my parents paid for the rest out of pocket. I think it was almost $20k a year for the rest (inc. room &amp; board). ",

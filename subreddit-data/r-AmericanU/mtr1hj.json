    "postText": "Hi Everyone, I'm currently a high school student admitted to International Studies. I'm having trouble choosing between AU and another DC area school that I won't name in order to avoid people just saying American is better. Anyways, I was hoping someone would be able to sell me on AU and all that it offers. Some additional info: I'd really like to focus on doing research and internships during undergrad and plan on going to grad school after college. Also, school B is an OOS public school and I was admitted to their honors college and received approximately 50k in scholarships neither of which I received at AU.",

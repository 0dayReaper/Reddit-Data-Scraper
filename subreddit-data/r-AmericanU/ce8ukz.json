I could've gone to a cheap public school but they wanted me to do summer classes (overlapped with an important event I want to go to) and they micromanaged the shit out of my schedule so I decided to leave\n\nAnyhow, it's only gonna be for one year until I can go to this other really great school",

Average AU graduating senior makes $45k/yr in first job out, often in DC so very hard to pay down loans given cost of living. AUx1&amp;2 don\u2019t transfer easily to another institution so you will probably have to take 17.5 credits to transfer 15 elsewhere. You can try to talk to AU fin aid esp if your situation changed (parents divorce, lost job, etc). Consider online classes at reputable place and apply to a public school next year.",

The connections here are great, but don\u2019t spend the money if you don\u2019t plan to leverage it or get accepted to somewhere cheaper elsewhere. There is a growing body of evidence that student loans aren\u2019t worth the cost.",

    "postText": "Hey! \nJust wanted to reach out and see if there\u2019s anyone who knows much about the online masters at SIS. I just finished my app (I had a transcript delay) so I\u2019m a bit later than I wanted, but wanted to see if anyone had any insight or could maybe alleviate some anxiety I have about my prospects of getting in. \nSome context, I know I\u2019ll have strong recommendation letters, I have a BA in Poli Sci, smaller state school, but I have a 3.84 and I\u2019ve worked full time while finishing my degree over the past few years. Im a non-trad student and a bit older (26)",

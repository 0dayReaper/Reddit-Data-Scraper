    "postText": "So I submitted my application about two weeks ago. Every other college I have submitted applications to then sent me emails prompting me to set up a portal. All that I received from AU was an email saying that they had received it and they looked forward to reading it. It made no reference to setting up a portal. I know there is a \"Future Eagle\" portal that can be made before you even apply. Is this the same thing or am I missing something? Thanks in advance yall!",

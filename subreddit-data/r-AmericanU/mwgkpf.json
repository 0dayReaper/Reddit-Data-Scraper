    "postText": "Hi everyone! I want to major in film/media and my top two right now are American University and Boston University. Both schools have great programs and multiple buildings dedicated to communications, but I'm not sure which is better.\n\nI like American's campus and it is also near my hometown. However, BU is ranked higher (BU ranked 42 nationally and AU ranked 77). The problem with BU is it has a reputation of grade deflation and the campus itself is much less safe (well, if you could even call it a campus).\n\nWhat are some pros and cons of AU? Anything I should be warned about? What are the students like here? Any info about dorms and dining?",

All the middle tier colleges deflate grades to prevent you from transferring to better schools.  Boston is a better city and BU is in more of a central location than AU.  The media market may be bigger in DC bc of the foreign bureaus etc.  Boston still has a ton of media.  BU has a (detestable) hockey team and has a massive inferiority complex with BC.  Both BU and AU have similar demographics (mostly neurotic NY/NJ types). Food is better in Boston, you can't get good pizza in DC. BU is a 30-90 minute drive from many different beaches and ponds, skiing in the winter, more college kids living closer together in Allston/Brighton, Mission Hill, Brookline, etc.  Go with BU",

My question is whether you could really tangibly feel any difference in crime rate when you\u2019re living on a college campus, even one that\u2019s spread out like BU. I dunno, a lot of people talk about it when they\u2019re considering going to school in Seattle (where I lived for a time), and it just is so ridiculously overblown at least in Seattle. The homeless people (which is usually what people are worried about for here specifically) aren\u2019t gonna jump you on your way to get a burger. Again, I could just have a warped perspective here but I don\u2019t see it making a huge difference when you\u2019re on a college campus most of the time.",

I specialize in short-form video and right now I plan to take it in the advertising direction. I'm not really a movie nut so cinema doesn't interest me that much either. BU does offer an advertising minor which is making it more appealing to me right now. \n\nAU is a cheaper school since I was offered a scholarship, but I'm not sure if it's the place for me. In terms of location, both schools seem good for internships and opportunities. I think AU might have a little more but I can assume most of the ones they're talking about are journalism related though.\n\nI have heard great things about BU but I've also heard bad things. With AU, nothing good or bad about the school has really applied to me. I'm having trouble finding anyone at all that has my major.",

They do more of the cinema side, but it might be helpful for you still. \n\nOverall, they've had a mixed experience here. They love DC, the city, and say they've had some great professors, but they've taken some classes in the major that felt worthless and a waste of time. I feel like that definitely is a thing for any major at any school you go to, but idk. I think people at AU might be slightly more interested at how politics and activism can combine with film, though I think there are some people interested in short-form and advertising. I'd say if you're okay with saving money and taking classes that may not fit perfectly with your desired career path (idk if we have an advertising minor), then AU will be fine and there'll be opportunities outside of the classroom - DC is a great city. If you're super set on studying advertising and you know that's what you want to do, then assuming the finances are okay maybe take a hard look at BU. Hopefully that helped a bit.\n\nAlso since nobody is really answering your original overall question, lmk if you have any other general questions about AU and I can help out.",

Those are generally fine and you have a decent amount of room. Then you have Anderson which is a recently renovated building for freshman. It's typical doubles where you share a floor bathroom with your gender. The rooms aren't that big but it's a college dorm so I'm guessing you won't find dorms that much bigger at any other school. The Anderson dorms are pretty nice compared to the others since they were recently redone. The other dorm for freshman is Letts, lovingly known as the Letto because it's the ghetto dorm. I lived there and had a really great time but it's definitely not so nice, especially compared to the other two options. That being said it's more of an intimate floor layout and you'll get to know your floormates more in Letts which creates a cool sense of community imo. Overall it's basically your average dorm experience, you won't be in a spacious room your freshman year, just an average college dorm. Sophomore year and beyond the options change and generally get better.\n\nIn terms of the students, I'd say it's mixed. I do know some people who spent a ton of time studying, but personally I've always been a procrastinator and a quick worker, and I've never felt too bogged down by work here. There have been some midterm weeks or final weeks or a few random weeks during different semesters where I was swamped, but mostly I've had a lot of time to do fun stuff and have a great college experience.\n\nBack to your first point, definitely take that idea of a change into account. Living 30 mins away from your home and living in Boston is a big difference. I personally needed to get away from my hometown, but I know some people who lived close to DC their whole life and needed to go to college in DC because they wanted to stay close. Anyway definitely lmk if you have any other questions, I remember being really unsure of my choice to come here and was very nervous, and it would have helped me to talk to a current student, so I'd be happy to answer any other questions.",

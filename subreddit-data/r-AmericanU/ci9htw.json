TDR's pizza is bad and Pi &amp; Fry is\u2026 eh, and that's been a major disappointment the last few years. Pickle District also sounds neat.\n\nWhere are they putting all these stores in MGC, though? Are they replacing the ones in the Tavern and the Tunnel with them? (I presume this means Megabytes is gone forever, RIP.)",

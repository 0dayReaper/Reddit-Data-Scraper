    "postText": "Hi! I am a potential student of data science program of AU. I would like to know some information about the program like the academic and comprehensive ranking of the program, the living expense in DC, the overall evaluation of the program and university, the employment of the program etc. I can barely find these information on the internet so hope to get more here. Appreciate.",

            "comment": "Hey, graduate student in the data science program. The data science program here is very brand-new, so it\u2019s still small but growing exponentially every year. AU\u2019s been trying to up its game in science majors so there\u2019s been science building building up each year, the department of statistics building(Don Myers) is less than 2 years old. This is my second year in the program and I\u2019ve enjoyed it. The professor are very knowledgeable and nice. Granted, it doesn\u2019t have the prestige a lot of other school has due to it being new but it\u2019s definitely improving and has a huge potential. Recently the author of R programming just gave to Katzen and delivered a seminar(forgot his name, Garrett something).",

            "comment": "As for Dc, it\u2019s pretty expensive but I\u2019m sure you realize that. As for apartments, I\u2019d strongly recommend staying away from Berks and Avalon as they\u2019re expensive as fuck and far away from anything other than AU. Van Ness, friendship heights and Bethesda would be better options IMO. As for the job market, again, DC is not the best job market for data science but it\u2019s definitely there. I\u2019m currently hearing from government agencies and other tech companies(on a smaller scale, nowhere near IBM/Microsoft or course). Your work destination would likely be in northern Virginia(Arlington, Reston) as that\u2019s where most of the tech companies are. Also, New York is not too far away so you might consider applying there too. The data science program has the best earnings out of all the graduates at more than 80k out of college, even more than the prestigious programs here like SIS and Kogod.",

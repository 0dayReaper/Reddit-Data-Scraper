    "postText": "Hi everyone, I'm a high school senior looking to studying public health.My top 4 choices are AU (as a public health scholar), GWU, UD, and Lehigh. At UD I will be a nutritional and medical science major and a world scholar so I can travel abroad twice which is cool. Besides a school with solid academics, I'm interested in a lively school spirit and good/approachable academic advisors, nice dorms with AC, and an accessible alumni network.\n\nWhat are some pros and cons I should consider before committing? To current students is there any advice you can give me about AU that you wish you knew beforehand?\n\nAny insight into these topics and or schools would be appreciated!  :)",

            "comment": "Stem isnt big so courses wont be as flexible as other non-stem classes. HOWEVER, the extracurriculars really shine. If you want to get into research it is relatively easier than other schools. As a freshman I was able to get into research 3 months in which would be unheard of at a school like UMD or GW. Many science and math professors are very willing to help and knowledgable in their respective fields. I really do think you have to make the most out of it and know what you want. The small classes are also great for getting to know professors for future jobs or recommendations. All science professors also love to talk about their work so that is a great way to get involved. Two of my professor work at NIST, i got to know them and eventually did an internship there my first summer because they both put in a good word. The community is very small so I was also asked to do several other stem related extracurriculars such as editing the science on campus magazine and a couple of other jobs. Very worth it but you need to take initiative. My instructor for a Lab also told me that is how she became a lab instructor as she was personally into the community already and considered on that and her general academics as a Masters student.",

            "comment": "Not a current AU student, graduated 2019 and has started my professional career . Here\u2019s what I think. \n\nPros: Upass, beautiful but small campus, enthusiastic and politically active student body, talented faculty, located in a safe area and very accessible to downtown Dc...\n\nCons: Lack of STEM community, expensive, unknown outside of the DMV area, least respected among the big 3 DC schools, too liberal...\n\nI\u2019ve known people in the public health program and most of them end up pursuing a grad degree in that area outside of AU. I know some in Emory, NYU, I even know one who got admitted to Harvard. AU has a pretty decent public health program. If you take bio classes, they just built a state-of-the-art building that you might use after Covid ends, it\u2019s pretty lit. \n\nI was a STEM major and was part of a small community of 50 people. Everybody knew each other. It\u2019s less competitive and much easier to get to know the profs well, and get opportunities to do research, LOR etc. So the small STEM community turned out to be a blessing in disguise..",

While I know AU is not a true engineering school they seem to be prioritizing STEM and including some interesting areas of interest such as cyber.  In addition it seems it would allow for a minor as well.  However, with all that said how is the quality of the program?  You mentioned research.  Is this easy to get for an undergrad?  TIA.",

                            "comment": "I was a stats major at AU. The STEM community at AU is small but very tight-knit. Everybody knows each other. And we know the professors super well so we get a lot of one-on-ones with rigorious courses like Machine Learning etc. Research isn\u2019t hard to get if you know the profs well and yeah they serve well as experiences on your resume. The quality of education isn\u2019t as high as schools say like UMD, but you learn most of the essential stuff same as other STEM schools. Homework and exams probably won\u2019t be as sadistic as those schools but they are by no means easy and you still learn stuff. AU isn\u2019t super hard on grading, as long as you try your best, I don\u2019t really see you getting a B or below for any class, which is totally different from schools which deliberately try to crush your GPA. \n\nEverybody I know in the CS and stats major end up landing good jobs in the DMV area, so I would say job placement is pretty good. I worked as a data analyst for Children\u2019s National Hospital and my friends in CS/stats land jobs in GEICO, Booz Allen, capital one, Amazon, so in the end I don\u2019t think school matters that much, it\u2019s about personal experience. And AU gave me the experience I needed to put on my resume to impress employers. So yeah I don\u2019t regret coming to AU at all. \n\nOverall the school still emphasizes strongly on liberal arts, but the entire STEM community concentrates on the east campus and cut out from the main campus so we\u2019re on our own island. I really enjoyed being part of the group.",

I\u2019ve worked there for 3 semesters and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It\u2019s a good opportunity for building connections. \n\nBeing in DC does have its perks. I know the physics program at AU has internship opportunities for its stufents. I know a couple who interned at NASA Goddard during the summer.",

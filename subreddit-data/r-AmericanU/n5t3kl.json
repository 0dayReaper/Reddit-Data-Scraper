I\u2019m on a UC floor right now and honestly couldn\u2019t tell you what the other classes in my \u2018cohort\u2019 thing are lol, it\u2019s not a big deal. If one of the classes/themes seems interesting to you and it feels right, go for it! If not, don\u2019t sweat it.\u201d",

            "comment": "I did UC my freshman year and I am a program leader this year helping lead one of the UC classes since I loved it so much! I met my roommate and my best friends in my UC Cohort. It is an amazing program and the professors really do cultivate a sense of community in class and that translates to your home life. I definitely loved it and if you have any questions about it reply here or feel free to dm and text me! There are not rly any negatives other than the fact that if you meet and get a roommate outside of UC it\u2019ll be hard but it can also increase your chances of getting a roommate who is passionate about the same things as you. You\u2019re also have a likely chance of being in Anderson  best halls for freshman. I think you should def consider doing UC if you and your friend are planning on being in the same cohort. However if you really like your roommate and don\u2019t want to do it you don\u2019t have to. It\u2019s just a great way to meet people. You can still take the classes without being in UC in the spring",

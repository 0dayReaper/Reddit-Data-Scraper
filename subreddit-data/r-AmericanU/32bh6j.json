    "postText": "Hey! I am looking at grad school for fall '16 and am considering American U. I am trying to narrow down my list and am wondering if anyone can answer these questions - or as many of them as they can. I am looking at the Public History MA and coming from Chicago.\n\n**History Program:**\n\n* How do you like the program?\n* How helpful/knowledgeable is the faculty?\n* Did you get funding for MA? If so, how much?\n* How hands on is the program? What resources do you have access to?\n\n**University:**\n\n* Do you feel like you made the right choice coming here? Why?\n* How is the administration? Are you able to get a hold of them? Are your questions or problems handled well?\n\n**City/Town:**\n\n* Are there chains or Independent restaurants? How are the coffee shop and bars? \n* What is the atmosphere of the city?\n* What are the winters like?\n* Does anyone commute from outside DC?\n\nThank you so much. Anything else I should know, please feel free to let me know.",

I have been able to visit once and got to talk to some current graduate students. They seem to be enjoying the experience. I am a little scared to make the jump from full-time employment to living off loans again. Did you apply to other MA programs? If you want to chat more, PM me. :)",

            "comment": "I can't speak to the history or grad program, but hopefully the following view of the school as a whole will be helpful. \n\nI am an International Studies major (like a looot of people here) and I definitely feel I made the right choice. There are a variety of clubs and opportunities that fit my interest and there's plenty of events in, around and on campus that cater to a variety of majors and interests. DC is a pretty robust city with lots of scholarship and intellect so if you look hard enough you'll find plenty of groups for your interests and develop yourself professionally. \nIn terms of administration I can't say much, but I would encourage you to avoid the people over at housing and dining if at all possible. I actually work there and I can confidently say that I've heard far more horror stories from the students I interact with than good ones. I have not had extensive interaction with the people in the financial office but it seems from what I've heard that they are at least competent which is more than some offices on campus. \n\nDC and the metro area have the feel of a big city without all the high rises. There are a ton of independent restaurants, shops and business. There are also plenty of chains, so you can find whichever you choose to pursue. Just like any city there are plenty of coffee shops like starbucks and smaller places that are specialty. The bar scene is pretty robust. Adams-Morgan (three metro stops south of Tenleytown) has a younger crowd, generally 21-25 from what I've heard. It's a typical college bar area that serves AU and UDC. U street has become a trendy area recently (its just south of Howard University) and typically it has a late twenties, early thirties kind of crowd I've heard. \nI spent my first winter in DC this past year (I'm a transfer student) and it was definitely different from back home (Texas). If you buy the proper clothing, a heavy coat, boots and headwear/scarves, you should be fine. Getting around in the winter is not typically too difficult--The metro is underground for the most part and will run during the winter, but bus routes are subject to road conditions during snow.\nPlenty of people commute from outside to go to school actually. There is definitely a community of students on campus that is very active, but commuter students are just as active in my experience. I will soon be one as well and I plan to remain just as active on campus. \n\nThe one thing I would warn you of is housing prices. I experienced a huge sticker shock moving here, I went from a 400/month for my own bedroom and bath shared with 3 roommates to 900/month for a 2 bedroom in Maryland shared between myself and 2 roommates. That's definitely something to be ready for, but if you look hard enough and are willing to compromise on having your own bedroom you can find a decent price out of the city probably. \n\nHope this helped! Let me know if you want to know anything else.\n\nEdit: /u/kahzaa has posted on here before about grad school. You may wanna ask them. ",

Not found of repeated winters like that, but it was warmed than the year before. \n\nI know the DC is more expensive than Chicago. *Cringe*, so much for rent. I am sure I will work something out!",

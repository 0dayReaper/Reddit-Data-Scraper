I would be moving from Washington state ( Seattle area).\n\nAny advice or things I should know about the program, from people that are in it? Also, any general advice about being at AU or moving to DC would be helpful. From what I\u2019m seeing it\u2019s really expensive to live in DC, so any advice in that arena would be helpful.\n\nI would really like to meet new people when I\u2019m in DC as well. I hope it\u2019s not one of those cities where it\u2019s hard to meet friends. I know Seattle is.",

Aside a from a few key fields, grad students tend to be closer to/over 30 and for whatever reason (I think it may be money related*), this program skews younger.\n\nThere are opportunities to interact with people on the hill, but know that A) DC is very transactional. You can follow each other on LinkedIn and have a meeting, but it will ultimately be \u201cget back in touch when you have experience\u201d if you don\u2019t have something valuable to offer (and even then, experience isn\u2019t really enough. They want connections) and B) it can be tough to work full time and do this program. They will encourage you to work on the hill, but evening classes start at ~5:30, so you would have to leave work a little early those days and if you don\u2019t already have work experience built up, you\u2019ll be entry level and that may be hard to do.\n\nI\u2019m not at all in politics. I absolutely HATED DC and couldn\u2019t wait to move back north though, so there are fewer political options for me. Should be noted that the person I know from grad school who is the furthest entrenched in politics was actually a PoliSci MA (the 2 programs overlap some).\n\nI loved the professors, feel like a learned a lot, and the course work was good. That being said, I think I liked it because I like school in general and not because it helps. \n\n*this can\u2019t really be overstated enough. All those kids whose parents are paying their rent also have mom and dad paying full tuition. Those kids can afford to work underpaid or unpaid. If the schedule doesn\u2019t work, they can just leave the job and be okay.",

The people I knew who worked full time and were students full time were crumbling and struggling with grades or on coke.\n\nMy part time work was in a TOTALLY different field (sports coach), which also doesn\u2019t help in the long run, but the only part time things in and around politics were unpaid or super low paid.\n\nI do want to stress than I graduated May of 2020, so job prospects were horrific, even with an internship, years of experience prior to grad school, 4.0, capstone awards, but it did take ~10 months to get a full time job (I was interviewing in Feb and early March, but those sure did dry up).\n\nI also, full disclosure, cannot express how much DC sucks. You are your job there. Even if you don\u2019t over work (although you\u2019re often expected to), that\u2019s what people will know you for and relate to you over. It is the first question people ask of you, and if it does not relate to their job in anyway, that puts relationships to a stop. By the time I left, I only had ~3 friends (2 of which also left DC) and was only happy when I was coaching high schoolers who didn\u2019t have such weird expectations of everyone.\n\nI\u2019m from NY and couldn\u2019t wait to get back. I have friends here I\u2019m pretty close to, have known for ~15 years, know so much about, but none of those things is \u201cwhat they do for a living.\u201d I\u2019m happy to talk work and jobs and do sometimes, but good lord there are other things.\n\nSo if you\u2019re in it because you love school and have the money? Highly recommend. If it\u2019s for jobs and you will have to hustle, I caution you.",

I went straight from undergrad and I looked at Facebook housing groups for a group rowhouse because I knew I wouldn't be able to afford living on my own and I wasn't familiar with the area so I wanted people to live with. \n\nThe first year they pretty much tell you which classes you should be taking (they would be prerequisites for later semester classes). Second year is mostly electives with the capstone. \n\nThey have these cool battleground classes (I didn't take them but my friends did) during election season where students would do on the ground reporting and other comms related work at campaign events in Pennsylvania and another battleground state I cannot remember.\n\nThe one annoying thing I will be honest about is that there is a required 4 credit class, there are two you can choose from: Campaign Management Institute (CMI) or Public Affairs Advocacy Institute (PAAI). I may have the second name wrong bc I didn't choose that one but that's the jist of what it's called lol. So the annoying thing about it is that it's a two week class 9 AM - 5 PM (they may let you early some days or give a day off) and you can only take it during the winter semester which is basically winter break or during the summer semester. For someone who used financial aid it was annoying to have to pay for a class out of the normal fall/spring semester unexpectedly, and 4 credits cost a lot. Also, even though this wasn't an issue for me specifically, a lot of grad students work full time and some jobs may not let people take 2 weeks off. Luckily for me I was only doing a paid semester internship at that time so by the time that class started my internship was over.\n\nOther than that I have enjoyed the program overall and learned a lot. Definitely feel free to DM me with any specific questions!",

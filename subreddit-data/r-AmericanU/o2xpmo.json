    "postText": "Yesterday I received an email from housing saying that my room assignment for  Leonard was cancelled for fall 2021. Not only that but ALL upperclassmen and sophomores who were in  Leonard received the same message. Apparently, Housing screwed up their calculations for freshmen and didn't realize until the last second. I and everybody else already have had our room assignments for 3 MONTHS already. Due to their miscalculation, they are giving our assigned rooms to freshmen instead. Now they said they still had room for us on campus, but there is a catch. The only option they gave me and other upperclassmen were rooms in frequency which are significantly more expensive than  Leonard. It really feels like a slap in the face from the school to students who don't have that many financial resources. They're basically saying \"pay up if you wanna stay on campus\".  I planned my budget around being in Leonard and paying the traditional hall rate. It isn't fair for the school to screw something up and then force us to pay for their mistake. Has anybody else here been affected by this? I'm just really frustrated and hurt that they would treat upperclassmen this way.",

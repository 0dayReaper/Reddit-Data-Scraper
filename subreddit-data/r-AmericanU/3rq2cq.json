I can't say from experience, I submitted my* 30 ACT score because I felt comfortable enough with it. \n\nThere's no point for them to advertise as test optional if they're just going to separate the non-tested and tested applications. In your case, I would leave the 1600 off your application, if I were you. I'm 99% sure it will do more harm than good to include it. As long as your essay and other application submissions are solid, the test score will only reflect poorly on your true academic ability.\n\nMay I also suggest trying the ACT if they offer it near you? I scored about 250 points more on my ACT (if you convert to a comparable SAT score). ",

I applied Honors and didn't get that, but at least it allowed me to have more dialogue with the school. I am in the University College which I can say is pretty cool, having a class with only kids from your floor. But like 50% of Freshman students are in UC. At least, like you said, it shows a bit more effort. ",

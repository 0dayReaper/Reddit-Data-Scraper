    "postText": "I\u2019m trying to decide between colleges right now and American is one of my top choices!!! :) However, I was wondering for those of you already at American if you have received/ are going to receive any refund on room&amp;board, tuition, etc since the year got cut so short. My parents are really hesitant about paying for American if classes in the fall are going to be online &amp; I wanted to see if online classes have changed anybody\u2019s payments, and if so, by how much?",

They probably will need time to calculate how much to refund and how to refund it. As for if the fall semester becomes online, they will discount tuition and won\u2019t charge for housing and food I think.",

            "comment": "The housing/dining will be refunded pro-rated from about March 23 (official move out date though most students got there earlier, and the final actual date most students were in dorms was March 6- before spring break). Don\u2019t think anyone has been paid back yet. There is no official policy, but doubt you would get back your deposit if you pay for fall in-person classes, but they end up online. You can take online classes at a reasonably priced and often higher ranked in-state university and then transfer into AU or another university once universities and the rest life returns to some normalcy. If you were on a Pell grant at AU then $3m of the $6m Dept of Ed bailout will be used to help you- but AU hasn\u2019t announced how/when AU will help Pell grantees.",

I am willing to pay for it, thank you! \n\nI would like some sort of proof (due to the number of scam messages I've already received). I prefer a picture of the ticket without your name/the qr code(s) ofc, or the email that shows you received them. If you are unwilling to provide proof, please do not message me.",

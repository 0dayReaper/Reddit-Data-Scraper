It keeps changing, but I believe Mary Graydon on the main campus and DMTI on east campus have stayed open 8am-11pm, seven days a week with keycard. The library also has bookable study rooms Mon-Sat (currently not Sundays).\n\nSome academic buildings went to limited access, only for faculty/staff with offices there. About half are even kind of \"closed\" without full HVAC or janitorial service. They heat and A/C somewhat to keep the building from getting mold or whatever, but not necessarily to a comfortable temperature, so it's expected even profs would only go to pick up stuff they left in their office, not really work there.\n\nThe current plan (barring a giant covid spike, I guess) is to have all the buildings open as usual when the fall semester starts.",

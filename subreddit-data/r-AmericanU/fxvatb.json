    "postText": "I got accepted to AU and am considering it for an MS in Justice Law and Criminology. Being in the nations capital, I applied for the potential for internship opportunities. Anyone have experience In this major or something similar, like Poly Sci? I\u2019ve been told being in DC can actually make it more difficult for an internship because of how competitive it can get. Is the university able to help students get internship leads?",

            "comment": "Since it's a MS, I'm assuming the degree is heavy on the quanitative side? My MA in Public Policy (Defense)  (located outside DC area) was half quantitative and qualitative - during my internship in D.C. area I was with both quantitative statisticians ... Historians ... Law students ... Etc we were from all over. \n\nIn my opinion, DC based grad students were dicks. For whatever reason an elitist attitude developed with almost all the ones I worked with. You'll likely get better access and help with internships. Don't become a dick at AU.",

I am mostly interested in federal law enforcement (FBI, ATF etc...) and I have always naturally thought DC is the place to be for that",

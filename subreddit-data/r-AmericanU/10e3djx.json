As for why the acceptance rate is going up, it's either money related (new student center being built at community garden and East Campus was recently renovated right before the pandemic) or is a general paradigm shift (Dr. Fanta Aw who was VP for Undergrad Enrollment, Campus Life, and Inclusive Excellence will be leaving midway through this semester, and I can personally say that the honors program director left midway through Spring 2022 \\[which in itself kind of fucked the honors program\\], and my undergrad and master's academic advisors both left at the end of Spring 2022). Overall it's a bit troubling to see this happen in real time.",

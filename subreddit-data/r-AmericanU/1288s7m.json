I've also seen some folks on social media talk down on American for being in suburbs vs in downtown DC and having a more traditional college campus setup",

            "comment": "Personally, I\u2019m a bit disillusioned with college in general. I don\u2019t like how we are sort of tricked into believing our major will make us happy and employable, when in reality most majors barely make you more employable, and whether or not you get happiness in ur major is very hit and miss. I, for example, was in the School of International Service for 2 years. I was miserable. The professors don\u2019t really care about you, the material is utterly useless, boring, and tbh pretty basic.. stuff that I mostly already knew. \n\nI switched to neuroscience as a major and found the material and the professors much more engaging. But I still sort of have that nagging feeling that I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m here. A degree in neuroscience does not open up many doors. Anyway, although the neuro department is great, it is still relatively small and even though the professors love to interact with students, it is still probably a bit more difficult to get meaningful research experience at AU than a bigger, more prestigious college. I definitely had some trouble with that. There\u2019s just not enough resources for the neuro dept to do super high yield stuff.\n\nMore basic reasons why people don\u2019t like American is general lack of school spirit (although I find that this is increasing since our basketball team is smoking people) and horrible food on campus. These really aren\u2019t that bad though, and our beautiful campus and campus life make up for it in my opinion. I think if you ask the average AU student they\u2019ll actually like AU. It\u2019s just the most vocal ones are the ones who dislike it.\n\nLemme know if you have any other questions :)",

            "comment": "Context: I applied and got in ED1. AU was my top choice; I\u2019m not an embittered GW/Georgetown applicant who didn\u2019t get into the \u201cmore prestigious\u201d D.C. schools. I actually didn\u2019t even apply to them at all.\n\nA huge reason I wanted to come to AU is that it\u2019s lauded as the most \u201cpolitically active\u201d school in the country. This, contrary to my belief, does not mean there\u2019s a robust student protest culture and myriad of local organizing efforts off-campus you can immerse yourself in. Not that it doesn\u2019t exist at all, but \u201cpolitically active\u201d means the most students working/interning on the Hill &amp; other political establishment jobs. \n\nAU prides itself on its internship culture that I\u2019ve found inaccessible due to financial reasons. Personally, I can\u2019t afford to take on an unpaid internship (which are plentiful at AU); my consistent part-time job during the year is how I pay for groceries and stuff. As an (expensive!) private institution, AU can sometimes feel alienating for working- or even middle-class students. (In my experience.)\n\nAt AU, I\u2019m a Political Science major graduating next semester. The program has left me with much to be desired. There are far more classes that teach you practical job skills \u2014 basically how to be a campaign manager or a Congressional staffer, etc. \u2014 than in-depth Poli Sci theory and philosophy. If you are interested in theory and philosophy the Lincoln Scholars program is a great fit, but if you are not in this program then the few political philosophy classes SPA offers are even more inaccessible to you. In this regard, I often find myself wishing I\u2019d gone to a small liberal arts college instead of AU.\n\nAll of these are personal experiences and reasons why I\u2019ve come to dislike AU. It\u2019s more reflective of my own personality and shifts in academic interest than a failure of the school necessarily. But I also know I\u2019m not the only person who feels disillusioned in this way. If you\u2019re looking for a career-oriented school that will prepare you (and honestly funnel you) to go work on the Hill, for the CIA or FBI, or for a major private consulting firm (Deloitte loves us), come here. If the thought of making Excel sheets for the State department makes your skin crawl, look elsewhere.",

    "postText": "Hi there. So I\u2019m new to AU (and new to DC)! Any advice on where to shower on campus after a sweaty bike commute? I\u2019d rather not have to pay for access to the fitness center (Unlike students, staff like myself don\u2019t get free access to Jacobs fitness center). \n\nAnd just FYI here\u2019s some useful info on bike repair centers on campus and, if you\u2019re an AU employee, how to get $20 per month for being a good person and biking to work: [Biking @ AU](https://www.american.edu/finance/transportation/biking-at-au.cfm)\n\n\nUpdate: I checked and the first floor shower in the Don Myers building works! And I haven\u2019t confirmed this yet, but I\u2019ve also heard there are showers in the Law School and Business School buildings. Hooray for free showers!",

I personally use one called \u201cDude Shower\u201d but really any brand will work. They are basically giant wet wipes. Paniers will be useful too. A backpack will load your back with sweat.\n\nMake sure you keep your tires inflated and gears lubed. AU is on the highest ridge in DC so you will be getting a workout unless you are riding from Tenleytown.",

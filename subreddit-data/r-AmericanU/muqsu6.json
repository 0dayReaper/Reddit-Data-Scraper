I was part of the latter group, so I appealed mine 2 weeks ago and got they gave me 16.6k in grants (in addition to the existing 5.5k in loans they gave me). So if you don't get too good aid, it doesn't hurt to appeal at all, I really encourage you to do it!",

I didn\u2019t fill out the extenuating circumstances bc I also don\u2019t have any extenuating circumstances. Not sure what the regular appeal form you are referring to is but if you could pls send a link to it I would be extremely grateful!!!",

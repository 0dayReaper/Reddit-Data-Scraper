An IR degree is great but, especially in a city like DC, it is very difficult to do a ton with that BA. It's a pretty great school with knowledgeable professors but, end of the day, undergrad IR and related degrees in DC are what they generally are: a stepping stone to the civil service or further education.",

            "comment": "So in terms of the actual education that you will receive, it's phenomenal.  In terms of jobs after graduation, where SIS excels (or at least did when I was a student) is helping students get into consulting (but you're on your own for basically other jobs out of undergrad).  The stats when I was in school were for 8 deloitte slots, 6 went to SIS grads over Kogod grads (at least this is what I was told).  Most of my \"successful\" friends out of SIS with just a BA are in consulting.   The other thing is that the responsibility of actually finding jobs you want, networking, and applying to jobs will be placed on you, but AU's career services are fantastic.  I've held a multitude of internships and got a job immediately after graduating.  All of which I found through AU's career services.  Job success post-undergrad will largely be based on your own internship/job experience while you were a student.  \n\nDon't bank on just your SIS degree to get you anywhere.  But an SIS degree paired with awesome internships at DoD, DoS, think tanks, non-profits, etc. will land you great success.  I had a job when people older than me who had IR degrees from other schools were interning at the same place because they didn't get their work XP in in undergrad.  But again.....this is probably true of Elliot School and SFS as well.\n\nI think it's true of a lot of poli-sci related degrees though that just a BA won't really allow you to earn a significant wage unless you're in consulting...and even then there really isn't a ton of upward mobility unless you get a graduate degree.  Has nothing to do with SIS as a quality institution though.  They're not going to spoon-feed you job offers like many students assume they will.\n\nBut I can speak from job experience that SIS definitely has good name recognition in the DMV for IR related work.",

            "comment": "Yeah, it really depends if you're going for undergrad or graduate school. As a recent grad student there, SIS was incredible. The connections I made there landed me a job right out of school (my internship literally turned into a paid position the week I graduated).\n\nThe professors are some of the best in the entire world, and AU graduate grads are highly revered for new highers, particularly because SIS is seen as more practical than it's more theoretical DC counterparts. \n\nUltimately however, AU can only do so much for you as far as career advising and networking. It's up to you to make strong connection with professors, put yourself out there for beneficial internships, and network yourself. A large part of networking is being capable, confident, and charismatic - all things SIS can help with but ultimately comes from you.\n\nAs for undergrad, like others have said, an IR degree in undergrad is relatively useless, especially in DC. At that point you're going to SIS for the experience, opportunities, and edge to get into a good grad school. It's not going to land you a lifetime career at that point. If you have the money to pay for it, probably worth it. If money is a factor, I recommend going to a more affordable public school for undergrad and pursuing SIS for grad school.",

They even have a 5 year B.A./M.A. program at SIS if you want to graduate early. With 5-6 years in DC at AU you'll have plenty of time to work internships and make connections.\n\nIf you use that time wisely you could really be ahead of the game.",

Even if you land an entry level job, you're going to hit a ceiling pretty quickly where you're ineligible for promotions or raises unless you really stand out of the crowd, which is hard to do in DC. \n\nAn IR degree at the undergrad level is only useful in getting a master's in that regard. AU is  a great place to do that, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're going to go into debt and can go somewhere else for significantly less money. Save your money for grad school if that's the case, because where you go is much more important then.",

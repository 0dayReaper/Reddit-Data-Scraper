    "postText": "I was accepted into American University\u2019s Strategic Communication MA program and NYU\u2019s MA in Media, Culture, and Communication. I am having trouble deciding between the two programs so if anyone has some insight, please feel free to share! \n\nNYU seems to be a more widely recognized school and I\u2019ve wanted to live and work in NYC for a while now so it seems like a great opportunity for making connections in the NY area. AU also has a lot of connections to NYC but it\u2019s not located in NYC and therefore it\u2019s connections to NYC are probably not as good. AU also offered me an assistantship which seems like a great opportunity and the NYU program unfortunately doesn\u2019t offer anything like that. That said, the kinds of skills I would build through an assistantship at AU (writing, research, connections, etc) I could gain through an internship in NYC as an NYU student. Thoughts?? \n\nIf anyone knows of a better subreddit to post this, please let me know!",

I don\u2019t know about AUs program, but I\u2019d put a lot of thought into both and really research the differences between the programs because I\u2019d bet they\u2019re the same.",

One of CNN\u2019s leading hosts, Alisyn Camwerota was an AU grad and she gave internship spots of CNN to bunch of AU students last year. Currently president of CBS, Fox News are also AU grad. I\u2019d say for media/communications, your connections and real world experience better more than your school name. Both DC and NYC are great for media connections. It\u2019s always better to graduate from AU with tons of internship experience than from NYU with none. \n\nFormer NBA 2kTV host Rachel Demita also came to AU, and used connections to intern at NBC which is right around  to the campus.",

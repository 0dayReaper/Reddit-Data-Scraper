    "postText": "My son was admitted into AU and was interested in International Studies or Economics as a major. I think we've learned that SIS is a great school but haven't heard much about the economics program. Any thoughts or insight? I think he wants to work on issues rather than on Wall Street. How does economics at AU compare to a school like GW?",

BA will only teach fundamentals and theories while the BS teaches mathematic analytics. \n\nProfessors can be hit or miss since all economists are cooky but they are all incredibly brilliant in their field and usually have a fair amount of international relations experience.

Econ majors seem to be stereotyped as coldhearted conservatives even though it's really just a method of analysis which is compatible with many different ideologies. I am a left-leaning econ major, BTW.",

I'd imagine going to grad school in either econ or IS would be options, but what about eventual jobs? I don't think I know enough about those fields to know the opportunities.",

    "postText": "I've pretty much just decided to go to American University next year. I rejected a large scholarship at another school in favor of going to AU. It seemingly has the perfect academics, ideals, opportunities, and campus life for me.  \n\nMy only genuine concerns are the price and a possible lack of on-campus school-wide activities. \n\nAnything I should know?",

            "comment": "Not to discourage the decision, but if another institution is offering better aid and the  possibility of finishing college with as little debt as possible, than that should consider that option heavily. This is especially true if you wish to go beyond a Bachelor's degree.\n\nAs for activities, as long as you join a club or interest, there should be plenty to do. \nWhen it comes to prices, I personally think DC is kinda expensive, but depending on your living style is not too hard to save money. \nYou should look up the demographic at AU (whether ethnic or socioeconomic), if you are not part of that demographic you might feel dissonance on your first month or so.\nLike any other institution, AU has it's ups and downs. Hopefully AU it is to your liking.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m a rising senior from North Carolina, and American is one of the schools I plan to apply to, along with a few other mostly in-state schools. I\u2019m not 100% sure what I\u2019ll major in but it will most likely be in the public affairs school.\n\nMy credentials:\n- 30 ACT (superscored)\n- 4.0 weighted GPA, 3.7 unweighted\n- Rigorous courseload, I have taken 4 AP and 2 IB courses, and will be taking more my senior year\n- Volunteer research fellow at Ballotpedia, pursuing the Presidential Volunteer Service Award\n- AP Scholar with Honor if that counts for anything lol\n- I work cashier at Zaxby\u2019s and play drums in a band with some friends\n\nI\u2019m pretty confident I at least have a shot, but I do get the impression that American has become very competitive. Also, I will note that my school does report class rank, but I won\u2019t list mine on an application because it doesn\u2019t mean anything at my academically competitive school. (i\u2019m barely in the top 50% out of ~500 despite my grades)",

I had people tell me not to do this because I was bound to go to the school (mind you there\u2019s always an option to transfer). \n\nI didn\u2019t listen to what people said because I just knew that I wanted to go to AU. Not because of their academic reputation, not because it was DC, not because I\u2019m a \u201cwonk\u201d at heart. It was because when I toured there and walked around the campus it just felt right. I said to my mom on the tour that this was the school I was going to, and that\u2019s what ended up happening. \n\nI had 4 of the best years of my life at AU. While it was scattered with some of the worst times here and there for a variety of reasons, I tried new things, made new friends, and had mind-blowing experiences. \n\nMy advice is this: if AU feels right to you, then apply ED and don\u2019t let anyone convince you otherwise. If you\u2019re not sure deep down that you know you want to go there, then do RD and check out other schools as well. Going where you feel most at home means the bad times won\u2019t be as bad, and the good times will be that much better.",

I can tell you that applying Early Decision is a huge commitment, you're bound to go to the college and it's very tough to get out if the aid isn't good enough. There are lots of good schools out there so think hard about it.\n\nI got into American pretty easily with a slightly better application behind me in RD, you've got a good shot at admissions.",

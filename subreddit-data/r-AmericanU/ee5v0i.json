At the time we thought:\n\n- Georgetown - a place we applied and didn\u2019t get in to. Stuck up. We were largely jealous they had better bars near them. But it\u2019s Georgetown, so what do you expect. \n- GW - hyped up, largely on par with AU.\n- UMD - good school, so far away. \n- Howard - good school, but also far away by DC standards, so we rarely interacted. \n\nAll of the schools produced largely similar career prospects. Georgetown does have the edge though.\n\nEdit: I forgot Catholic - need i say more?",

I feel like I would\u2019ve been more successful at different college. Even visiting GW back then, it felt more like a \u201ccollege\u201d. Mainly, the counselors were horrible at AU.

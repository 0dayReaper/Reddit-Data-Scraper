    "postText": "I'm a clinical psychology doctoral student at AU, and I'm hoping I can ask for your help with my dissertation. I'm recruiting participants who are 18-30 years old, currently live in the US, and smoke at least one cigarette per week. The study involves two online sessions one month apart; each session should take about 20-30 minutes to complete. Participants will have a chance to earn a $25 gift card for the first session and a $50 gift card for the second session. Feel free to email CBTSmokingStudyAU@gmail.com with any questions. \n\nPlease spread the word if you know of anyone who may want to participate. Thanks so much! :)\n\nLink to informed consent: https://american.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1NRZC4ynEvXCyy1",

    "postText": "Hey Everyone!\nSo turns out I am officially going to AU so with that comes about a billion more questions. \n\n1. Is University College worth doing? How do the credits effect you graduating?\n\n2. Is the Leadership Academy a big commitment? Would I be able to do that and University College?\n\n3. What is the best work study job to have on campus?\n\n4. Does anyone have any advice for an International Studies Major wanting to later pursue law? Is there a better path I could be taking? \n\n5. How much are students paying out of pocket on average to go to American? \n\nPlease Help! ANY advice is greatly appreciated! ",

            "comment": "Hi! Alumna and former staff member here.\n\n1) My friends who did University College had a lot more friends than I did early on in college. I will say though that the people in your UC are going to be complete nerds about the topic, so if you're kinda eh about it you might not love it. My best friends were in a philosophy UC and were only eh about philosophy, and I think they are glad they did it but they didn't get as much out of it as the kids who went on to major or minor in philosophy. Credits shouldn't affect graduation. Make sure to see advisors early and often, no matter what you wind up doing, and you'll be okay.\n\n2) I don't know anything about that. It's pretty new, so I can't tell you what it's like or how it is compatible with other programs. I personally would forgo it and focus more on becoming the leader of a club or group or even volunteer locally.\n\n3) My former office ;) But really they're all fine. It's a job, it's only a few hours a week. Make sure it's something that will give you marketable skills, even if it's general office stuff. My work study job got me my first job out of college, which then got me where I am now. EDIT: Try to work in the same department or a related department to your major; the amount of inside knowledge you'll get and personal connections with professors who can then write you great letters of rec is invaluable.\n\n4) Law schools don't really care what your undergrad major is in if you do well on the LSAT and the rest of your application. Do what you love in undergrad and learn how to emphasize the marketable skills of your degree (research, writing, public speaking, whatever it is) and you will be fine no matter your major.\n\n5) I have $38,000 in loans 2 years out, and that sucks but I don't regret attending even though I could have graduated with much less debt elsewhere. I wouldn't have had the same advantages and experiences though. I didn't pay anything out of pocket during my time there. I also had substantial financial assistance and scholarships, though.",

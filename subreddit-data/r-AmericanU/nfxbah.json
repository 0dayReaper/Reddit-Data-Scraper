    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI\u2019m applying to transfer and I am looking to make some money during the semesters. I make pretty good study guides and made them for my class last semester. I didn\u2019t charge people though. I also would be down to help people create study schedules and homework schedules. I was applying to be a coach for high school students on wyzant but I couldn\u2019t land any. I was wondering if there is a market and if it would even be allowed. Thank you!",

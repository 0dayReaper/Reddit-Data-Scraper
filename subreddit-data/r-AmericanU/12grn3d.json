    "postText": "I was recently admitted to AU and was wondering the chances of me being able to apply late to the honors program? I know I was a strong applicant, they sent me a letter telling me I was considered in the top 10% of the applicant pool- so I was really curious about the honors program (I didn\u2019t know about it previously).\n\nAlso, other question: How selective is the Cornerstone program?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Honors and cornerstone are both not really worth it. They basically give you more requirements to complete, with no extra scholarship or real academic benefits. Honors is okay if you\u2019re interested in research, but depending on ur department you can find the same opportunities on your own.",

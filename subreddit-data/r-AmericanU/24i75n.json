            "comment": "I just transferred into AU this past year from a community college, so I hope I can help.\n\nFirst off, I'd recommend against getting an apartment or studio if you're transferring from a CC.  One of the most important parts about the college experience, IMO, is learning to live in close spaces with people you might not normally get along with.  My roommate and I couldn't be more different, but we've managed to learn to live with each other, and I'd say that that's an important life skill that's worth exploring in dorm life.  Definitely don't go looking for a living arrangement in Virginia.  It can take well upwards of an hour to get to AU from Virginia, and if it's your first time living away from home then that is definitely not what you want.\n\nFirst of all, transfer students usually have housing in Leonard hall available to them.  It's not the best residence hall, but it's not bad.  It's standard fare -- two to a room with a lounge and a men's and women's bathroom.\n\nIf you're transferring into the University Honors program, you might be able to live in Hughes Hall, the Honors dorm.  It's being renovated over the summer, so it will supposedly be quite nice next year.  That's where I've lived the past year and I'm satisfied enough where I've decided I'm going to live here next year, too.  It's still the standard dorm affair -- two to a room, communal bathrooms, lounge with kitchen space.\n\nWhatever you decide to go with, I wish you good luck in your transfer experience at AU.  If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.",

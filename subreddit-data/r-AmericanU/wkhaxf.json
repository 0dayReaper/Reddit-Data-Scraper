It is also air borne and can be transmitted by close contact (not just sexual) I'd really hope they handle this more seriously",

Also, ya ofc it isn't bound to a sexual orientation, but tbc anal sex absolutely presents a higher probability of transmission than vaginal",

I made the factually correct point that the disease is primarily sexually transmitted and that gay people are far more likely to get monkey pox, which is extremely important to know for people in the gay community so that they aren't ignored like they were during the aids crisis in the 80s",

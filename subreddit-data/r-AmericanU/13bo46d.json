If you're interested in the subject, it's fascinating as Continetti is married to Irving Kristol's granddaughter, and has a wealth of first hand knowledge about the history of conservatism in America. Don't take it just for fun, it's very serious and it's one of those classes where if you miss even a single session you can be screwed big time. Continetti is very serious, but not in a mean way, just that he doesn't take shit from anyone. He is a full blown conservative, it's hard not to be if you're an expert on the subject like he is, but he's professional, rational, and means well.\n\nIn terms of fights in the class, no. Everyone that took it was conservative aside from maybe 1 or 2 that kept their mouths shut. I think all the non-conservatives dropped the class after realizing how serious it was. You have to be really interested and invested in the subject for it to be worth your time.",

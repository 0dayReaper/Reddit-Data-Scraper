    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI'm an  MPP student who'll be starting courses in the fall, and right now I'm looking for opportunities for assistantships. From what the school's told me, postings aren't available until August, and the preference survey is given in mid-June. In the meantime, I thought I'd contact professors about anything they had available?\n\nI'd like to hear from anyone who was a GA at American or knows someone who was. What was the experience like? Which professors are the best to work with? And what's the right way to balance the commitment against a full course load?\n\nFor myself, I'd prefer a research assistantship over a teaching one. I'd enjoy a position that involved working with data, though I don't have much experience in that area.",

Specific areas would be climate change mitigation and adaptation, pollution regulation, and renewable energy development.",

Not because its not useful or fun, but after graduation you'll be going up against people with demonstrated experience and coursework in the field.",

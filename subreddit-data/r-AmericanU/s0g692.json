    "postText": "Hi I am a Junior at AU and am looking to move in on the 14th of January. I have a budget of around 1000 or lower. I've looked on Facebook and am having some trouble finding a place. \n\nDoes anyone know a place renting out. Am open to places outside my budget preferably near AU.\n\nLooking for a private room but flexible on the bathroom situation. Shared homes and apartments all work fine",

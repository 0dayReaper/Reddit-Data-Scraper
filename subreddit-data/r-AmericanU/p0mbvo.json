I\u2019m thinking of moving there in the near future but I\u2019d like more insight. For context, I\u2019m looking at studio apartments and it\u2019s just going to be me living alone. Is Vaughan Place good? Or is the Berks better (or any other place lol). Thanks in advance :)",

Just look on Zillow or other real estate sites for other apartments in the area, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find something nicer. \n\n\nBut I went and looked at Vaughn Place and it seemed pretty nice, but we ended up not moving there since we found a group house on Wisconsin Ave anyway",

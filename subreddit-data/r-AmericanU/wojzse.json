Unlesssss you can get a large 2 bedroom on level a1\nEdit: let me elaborate the berks serves a great purpose cheap reasonable size housing super close to campus. But the cost comes in that it\u2019s old and pretty gross. I lived in apt A127 for two years and the group I lived with didn\u2019t give up the apartment until we had all finished grad school. This is because it was huge and we always had a pretty big culture of having people over and walking into our place at all hours of the day. We also had a patio with direct access to the parking lot behind the building which was awesome and allowed our friends to literally just walk in no needing to get buzzed in or anything. It served our purposes really well I lived there Sophomore and Junior year and was over there continuously until we gave it up in Summer 2021 after 4 years there. It honestly felt like home. It always had 4 guys living there and usually 5 guys sleeping there on any given night. It was truly the place I learned to drink, cuss, and fight. Man I\u2019m tearing up over here. All that to say no what you\u2019re getting into at the berks it\u2019s a great time for a certain type of friend group but even for us if we didn\u2019t have the size and direct exterior entrance I\u2019m not sure we would\u2019ve stayed that long. Also having a place rent controlled is pretty sick\nEdit 2: because you got me feeling good about the good old days. Apartment A127 which is where me and the boys stayed had a long history, I know Michael Cohen lived in that unit when he was at AU for 1 year and I actually met someone in my hometown who lived in A127 in the mid 00\u2019s I hope it made an impression on us larger than the one we made on it",

Berkshire and Avelon are the go to, but if you look into more Tenleytown you will find some reasonably priced apartments like the Terrace - you just need to commute via bus everyday",

Would I just attend honors classes or will the honors program be a large part of my life? Does it take a lot of time away from having fun, partying, meeting new people, and exploring DC? Any insight to the program, even if you're not part of it is greatly appreciated :)",

Honors Junior here and I can help answer some of your questions:\n\n\nIn terms of academics and classes, I'm not too sure about how it will impact you according to your major, also they changed the honors program after my freshman year so you'd have to talk to someone in the honors office/student honors board about the different programs and how it will impact you academically. In terms of social life, you will live in Hughes, which is honestly a great dorm and a great place to live. You'll be on a floor with all of the rest of the honors kids, and it quickly becomes a very tight-knit community and you'll meet a lot of great people. As long as you don't isolate yourself to that, though, you should also be able to meet a bunch of people outside of the program. You can party whenever, college is just about striking a balance between work, school, social life, and fun, so as long as you stay balanced you can really do whatever. The academic aspect of it won't keep you from living out your college experience in whatever way you wish.",

Like, do the type of people in the program seem any different then the rest of the students? Or is it kind of the same as a regular student hall? Would you recommend the program? ",

You're just normal students pretty much.\n\nHughes hall is pretty great, it's not on South Side (Letts and Anderson, where most freshmen are), so it's definitely quieter and more chill. You also get much bigger lounges, and the shape of the dorm (T-shape) really works to your advantage, as it's really easy to navigate and chill with your friends. I would talk to someone in the honors office/student honors board about it, because I don't really know enough about the new honors program",

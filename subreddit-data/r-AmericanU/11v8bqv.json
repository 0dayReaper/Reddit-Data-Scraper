If you want the true freshman experience (both good and bad people and experiences), just go the normal route and pick the UC freshman housing. Like the people ik who did UC are all the same vibe, which could be good for some ppl, but if u want to meet ppl from all over and with different vibes don\u2019t do UC.",

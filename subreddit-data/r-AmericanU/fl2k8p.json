We're a great school, but unless you're coming here for a degree that you don't believe you'll get the same quality elsewhere it isn't worth it.\n\nIf anything the option to transfer is inconvenient, but available as well. It'll save some money.\n\nWith the coronavirus situation financial aid is a bit strapped for time, but once admin can get back to normal operations, that can help. It never hurts to reach out!\n\nBest of luck and feel free to DM me!",

If you were given more money by another school, then mention that.  There\u2019s not guarantee that you\u2019ll get more, but it\u2019s worth a shot. If they dont give you any more, then dont take on all that debt.  That amount is way too much for one person, it\u2019s totally not worth it",

Can I consider Graduate school at AU, or maybe just getting a degree at UNO and moving out to find a gov't job?\n\nps sorry if these questions are dumb, I feel like no one (that I know at least) can actually understand how difficult this decision is for current high school seniors :(((\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthank you all and stay healthy",

Remember, this is a market that attracts nationwide college grads. Name recognition of your school is a big thing for employers, especially for non-stem majors. I\u2019d say with just an UNO degree, you won\u2019t get too far in DC. With a degree from UMD, UVA however, are much more respected in DC. Unless of course, you mean the local government of Nebraska and not the federal government, which I doubt.",

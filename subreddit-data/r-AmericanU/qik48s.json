    "postText": "This is directed towards people with a little more technical knowledge of the AU wireless network security protocols, but I\u2019m happy to hear any opinions or thoughts from anyone:\n\nSo AU offers a VPN through their own services, and I\u2019m working if they track user activity on it, or if they even have access to the traffic that students are going through. \n\nI\u2019m aware VPNs are supposed to be super-duper secure (/s in the case of NordVPN and others), but the notion of the wireless provider offering a VPN raises alarms. What are peoples\u2019 experiences with the VPN, and how secure is our data/traffic really?\n\nBest,\nJulian",

            "comment": "I\u2019ve never used AUs vpn, but I think more so that specific things that only work on campus wifi (like cloud printing and maybe some research stuff but I was fine at home last year without the vpn so don\u2019t quote me in that) can be accessed off-campus. I don\u2019t think it is to give us more security though.",

Besides printing, the only thing that comes to mind that requires being on campus or the VPN is the [high-performance computing cluster](https://www.american.edu/cas/hpc/), if you happened to be doing research with a prof who uses it.",

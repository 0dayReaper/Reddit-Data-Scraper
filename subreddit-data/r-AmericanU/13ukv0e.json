            "comment": "Most first-year students live on campus, so you\u2019ll have to work a bit harder to build relationships - be proactive about joining student organizations. Plan on spending a lot of time on campus, probably even on days that you don\u2019t have classes - especially in the first few weeks as departments and organizations are having their kickoff events and socials. \n\nGo to your professors\u2019 office hours. This advice holds for everyone, but I think it\u2019s especially true as a commuter because you won\u2019t have as many other opportunities to casually run into/interact with them outside of class. \n\nThere are [lockers you can rent for the semester](https://www.american.edu/library/services/lockers.cfm) in the library - it sounds like you should plan on being there at 8am on the first Monday of the semester because they are first come first served and go fast.",

            "comment": "The commute from PWC can be a bit long but doable. What I\u2019d recommend:\n\n-leave early in the day to avoid the worst of rush hour\n\n-stay later, traffic is better later in the day. \n\n-Familiarize yourself with campus, go to events, office hours, etc. you really want to immerse yourself on campus because you aren\u2019t getting the dorm experience that all of your peers will be. A lot of connections are built there - you might experience FOMO a bit but that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to get the most out of being on/around campus when you\u2019re there. Take the bus to Tenley sometimes and check it out, take advantage of being in the city in your spare time - you don\u2019t have to stay on campus all the time.\n\n\n-something I did was organize my schedule so i have all of my classes on 3 days (doing this when I had to commute from PWC made my life easier so I wasn\u2019t in the car for 3+ hours every day). I also had to work at home on weekends so I was spread thin esp if I had school every day. This one is optional ofc because maybe you want to be there every day but the commute can be a lot sometimes. Going on days  you have no class can be great too - I just never did this much when I commuted \n\nLong story short I advise you to find a schedule that works for you, and to make the most out of being on campus/in the city. Make friends and have fun!",

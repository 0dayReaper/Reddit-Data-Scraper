    "postText": "ED1 here :) As an incoming freshman I was wondering, is it possible to try and get into a student housing apartment with roommates? I just genuinely don't like the idea of sharing a room for a whole year. Is it cheaper, and is it worth it to try it out? I don't want to get into huge debt or something. Kind of excited/scared for this year. Thank you guys in advance!\n\nP.S. Is there a way to try and match with students for dorms or housing? Or to like, try and make friends so you can match with someone you might like. lol.",

You won\u2019t have the ability to get your own room through on-campus housing until Junior year when they open up Nebraska hall. If you\u2019re concerned about living situations, get your own apartment, but there\u2019s something about the dorm experience that everybody enjoys.",

Or join the group chat, find a few others you connect with, then dm them on Instagram/snap. That's a great way to get to know someone better. A few of us made Google Docs with a list of 20 roommate questions and shared that w potential roomies too",

            "comment": "In all honesty, I wouldn\u2019t be too concerned with housing bc opening campus is still up in the air for next semester. They technically never sent out official spring 2021 plans like they did for fall 2020. They said some classes would be in person but I\u2019m yet to hear of any class having in-person sessions. Essentially, don\u2019t get your hopes up with AU\u2019s ability to send out a plan in a timely manner. But if they open campus in the fall, I think they\u2019ll be doing single housing so you won\u2019t even have a roommate.",

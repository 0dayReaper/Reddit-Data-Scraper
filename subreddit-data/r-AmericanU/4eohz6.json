    "postText": "Hi there! I just created an account for this thread. I have recently been admitted to American University, but only for the Spring Semester. They offered the Mentorship program and I had a couple questions regarding it, specifically the Washington one. I have looked this up on this subreddit and google, but I kinda wanted a personal touch to it. \n\n1)How different is the experience for Mentorship kids and regular Fall semester students?\n\n2) I know Mentorship students reside in Leonard Hall, but how far away is that from the main campus? Are the students there soley mentorship students and international students or are there fall semester students mixed in?\n\n3) Are the classes offered only filled with Mentorship students or is there a mix?\n\n4) Lastly, I don't want to miss out on meeting new people and the beginning college experience. How displaced are Mentorship students compared to Fall semester students?",

Most kids live on the south side of campus.\n\n3) Mentorship kids are mostly with Mentorship kids. You will spend every waking moment with these people.\n\n4) You hardly see non-Mentorship kids. You also work/intern a few days a week, which drains social time as well.",

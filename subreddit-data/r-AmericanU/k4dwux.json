            "comment": "\"Worth it\" is a tough judgment to make. The point about price is definitely something to consider. A few other things to think about with this major:\n\n* Are you planning on staying in DC after you graduate? Location is one of AU's selling points, but if you don't want to stay in DC it's not as much of a factor in the decision.\n* What field are you interested in working in? Business Administration has a number of specializations which could influence whether it's worth it or not.\n   * This will also influence your job search after graduation. Some fields are easier than others to find a job.\n* Are you thinking of a grad program? You could do a 5 year program leading to a grad degree on top of your undergrad, but whether that's a good idea depends on your specialization. If you're not thinking accounting, I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nHappy to weigh in on other questions you may have.",

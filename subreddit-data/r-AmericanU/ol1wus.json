If you get, for example, $10-15k and other schools are offering you $20,000 or more, you can also email the financial aid office and say something to the effect of \"I would love to attend your school but unfortunately you haven't provided me enough aid to do so. Other schools have offered me x, and if American were to match that I would definitely go there\"",

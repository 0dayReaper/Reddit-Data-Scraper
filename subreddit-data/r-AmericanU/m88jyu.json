    "postText": "I was accepted into the school as a whole, but I'm not sure if I was accepted into honors or not. I think I wasn't? Earlier today I received an email saying, \"unfortunately, you were accepted\" (lol) followed by a corrected \"unfortunately, you were not accepted.\" However, a few hours ago I got another email saying, \"congrats on your admission to honors, sign up here for an info session.\" I saw a tweet where someone said \"AU accepted me into the honors program I didn't apply for?\" which makes me think everyone got that email by mistake and I'm not actually in, but if anyone has more information/can confirm that email was sent to everyone I'd appreciate it. Thanks!",

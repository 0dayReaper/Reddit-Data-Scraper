    "postText": "I was recently accepted into American\u2019s Masters program and had a pleathora of questions since I\u2019ll be moving from Yeehaw land (Texas).\n\n1. Program:\nAnyone have experience or insight w the DS curriculum? Is it exam or project based?\n\n2. Living:\nThe D.C. area is insanely expensive, is it worth it to move further away from campus? I was looking at Watermark at Buzzard Point  (8.4 miles, over an hour commute by metro). Any good rec\u2019s for those who still want to experience the DC area? Experiences w roommates - the good, the bad. \n\n3. Affording American: \nIf you feel comfortable, what were the merit based scholarships you received as a grad student? Trying to look for ways to afford this without a heap of loans.\n\nAny guidance would help, thanks! &lt;3",

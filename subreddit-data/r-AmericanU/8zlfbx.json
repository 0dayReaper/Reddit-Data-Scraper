    "postText": "Hello.\nLast week Thursday or Friday, I visited [this webpage](https://www.american.edu/finance/studentaccounts/Payment-Plan-Overview.cfm) and filled out the American Payment Plan Application form on SurveyMonkey, which informed me that I need to wait a several number of business days. I have not yet heard any response from them. It's only Tuesday now but I am getting anxious with how slow this process seems to be going. It also takes awhile for the respective office at AU to respond back to me. Should I wait on them or just contact their office? \n\nUgh... it seems to me that every issue I need to deal with AU is leading to frustration. ",

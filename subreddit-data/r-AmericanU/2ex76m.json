I'll be teaching the class on Thursday the 4th at 6:30PM at the [UberOffice in Bethesda](http://uberoffices.com/locations/bethesda/), right next to the Metro station. There's no sign-up for that one \u2014 just show up!\n\nThe class is about 90 minutes long, totally free, really fun, and these'll be my fourth and fifth times teaching it (so theoretically I know what I'm doing). You should **not** bring a computer!",

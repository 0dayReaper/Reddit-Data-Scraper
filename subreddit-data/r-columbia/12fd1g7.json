            "comment": "I'm hispanic, low income, but not first gen college. I have a very different experience/opinion than the other commenter. I think Columbia is not alienating at all IF you're comfortable with yourself and don't take things personally. There are definitely rich kids here who don't even realize how good they have it so they'll say some super out of touch shit or invite you to some expensive stuff just expecting you to be on board. Thats when you politely tell them its not in your budget and move on. \n\nYou'll also meet a lot of people with super awesome experience like having participated in published research in high school or did crazy academic competitions that allowed them to travel internationally and network with super high level people. Or they already read all the classic books you'll read for the first time in LitHum. I'm guessing you, like myself, didn't have that experience or opportunity growing up and thats perfectly ok, don't feel intimidated. If you treat them as normal then you'll get treated as normal. I see too many people here self-isolate because that get that imposter syndrome (especially as a GS student). \n\nLastly, you'll see the same thing at UCLA, the only difference is that you'll feel a bit more comfortable because of the higher Hispanic population. But at the end of the day, any T20 school is going to have a lot of white/asian rich people who will accidently make FGLI students feel uncomfortable for some reason or another. Just have a strong sense of self, don't take things personally, and make friends with people you vibe with no matter their background.",

                    "comment": "This is pretty spot on. I never felt like anyone looked down their nose at me or went out of their way to exclude me. But Columbia does have a lot of wealthy students who will casually take Ubers, invite you to eat at upscale restaurants, or go on fall/spring break vacation to somewhere expensive, and you have to be aware of your limits and not get caught up in trying to keep up with them. It's not personal at all.\n\nThat said, Columbia has a good number of Latino and FGLI students on campus. Sabor (throws the BEST parties on campus), Alianza, Chicanx Caucus, Groupo Quisqueyano. Also don't forget that New York City itself has a huge population of Latinos (Puerto Rican, Dominican, Mexican but not as much as LA obviously). \n\nYou can have an amazing social life at Columbia and in NYC, even as a FGLI student.",

                                    "comment": "Is this a troll? For anyone reading this, \"latino\" is still very much the preferred term for most latinos. Personally, I think Latinx is white washing our language and doesn't even make sense. In Spanish there is the -a ending meaning feminine, -o ending meaning male, but there are also many words just ending in -e that just have to be assigned a gender seemingly randomly (i.e. el restaurante and la carne). So really, if latino should he changed, it should be \"latine\" so at least the changed is natural to the Spanish language, not some random X letter that really has no precedent in Spanish.\n\nEdit: the comments got removed but pretty much someone was calling the commenter above me a bigot for using \"latino\" over \"latinx\"",

Rich people at this school can be annoying, and while I don\u2019t think Columbia does the best to adequately support their FLI students, there are many student groups that do their best to provide a home for students like us! FLI Network and Chicanx Caucus are groups that i have been most involved with! There are several other Latine student groups like Mujeres (Barnard), Alianza, SHPE, Grupo Quiseyano etc that all help Latine students feel at home. I have found an amazing friend group of FLI students that I absolutely love and hang out with everyday through Chicanx Caucus and FLI Net!\n\n*also worth adding that UCLA isn\u2019t exempt from this issue, I promise you there\u2019s thousands of UCLA students whose families are well off\u2026 UCLA is not a perfect school either!",

There\u2019s a lot to criticize Columbia for, but among its peer institutions my strong sense is it is the least elitist and privileged that you could find. Something about being in the City together is a great leveler. There are exceptions to that, of course, but generally I think it\u2019s a fair assessment.",

If your goal is to break into prestigious career paths, Columbia could be among the best places for you to do that, but I encourage high schoolers to seriously evaluate why their motivation is and whether it is actually what they want. Especially for a first-generation student, these paths can sound very appealing, but it can be harder to gauge whether it is really for you at this stage. I would submit that the institutions that provide those paths, as well as Columbia itself, have little-to-no genuine interest in supporting people like first-generation students so they can reach their full potential.",

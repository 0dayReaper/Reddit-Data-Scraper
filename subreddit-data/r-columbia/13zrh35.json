Are there better, and cheaper alternatives for international students (Aetna is about $4189 USD/$5600 CAD for 12-months coverage)? \n\nThank you.",

I spoke with a family friend who's a medical insurance advisor in the US, and she told me that short-term health insurance plans might be something to consider. She did say that some STH plans will not offer coverage for emergency visits if I have pre-existing conditions (and I have a severe nut allergy), so there is that problem. Also, if I offer several possible health insurance alternatives instead of Aetna, do you think CU will let me choose one that satisfies their list? Or am I forced into Aetna after providing any one alternative?",

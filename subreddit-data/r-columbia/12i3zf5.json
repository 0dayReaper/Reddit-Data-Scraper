    "postText": "Hey guys, I need to find a place to stay near Columbia for a week or so due to an emergency situation that has come up with someone who studies in Columbia. What would be the best option for temporary housing anywhere near the campus for a week or so? I tried looking at Airbnbs but there are very few of them available right now and some look kinda shady. Any help/suggestions would be really appreciated! Thanks a lot.",

My mom was able to get a nice discount there just by calling and saying she was coming to visit me at Columbia. I don\u2019t believe they required any verification or anything.",

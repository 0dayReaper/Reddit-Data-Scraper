    "postText": "I dont know if this is something that shouldn\u2019t be posted here but now im conflicted. Im planning on studying business and I really dont know which one I dhoild go to. For context I already live in new york so i do like the idead of getting away but i feel like columbia my be better in terms of prestige or connections? Idk? The bummy thing about it is right now im at a georgetown event and its really good so far, but i know at these afmitted student events its their job to convince yiu. And lets face it columbia is an Ivy League school and im trying not to let that impact my decision but passing it up is unsettling. I dont have any programming for columbia scheduled do you guys have any suggestions on how to make the decision. Should i even worry about prestige. Is it super competitive at columbia is everyone stuck up. Minirities there, do you guys find it easy to make friends. Anything helps.",

            "comment": "Hmm. Very difficult choice imo. Really up to your values.\n\nBoth are great schools if you want to go into finance\u2014McDonough for Georgetown and Econ/Financial Engineering \\[or really any major, if you can spin\\] it at Columbia. Georgetown, of course, has a focused school about it while Columbia is only the college that is focused on all arts and sciences. Prestige is not really that different unless you're looking globally, but even then it's pretty much splitting hairs and field dependent.\n\nCore Values: Georgetown is a Jesuit School. It's Catholic. That's linked to its values but it seems to me most Georgetown students can live a pretty secular undergraduate experience. Columbia has a classical education focus. A student will become incredibly well-read if they put the effort into their curriculum with all their readings.\n\nDifferences in classes: Columbia has the Core Curriculum. Everyone takes the same Literature, Philosophy, Art History, Musicology, etc. as a part of it. Georgetown does have something similar with classes to take, albeit with a little more choice. But if you're in the Business School there is a Business core, and also maybe will have to take Problem of God which is a religious philosophy course but not like uber-Christian from what I've heard. That being said, it's unlikely you'll have Friday classes at Columbia unless you take certain foreign languages. So you'll usually have a 4-day week and 3 day weekend. I also think the Business School has a forced curve in their classes at Georgetown.\n\nSetting: New York City vs DC. Both are cities. That being said, Columbia has a subway station right outside its gates. Georgetown doesn't, which makes it a little difficult to fully interact with DC as a whole. However, being active outside of campus is your own prerogative. Students can spend their entire 4 years at Columbia within a 20-block range. DC you'll just have less convenient access to travel. Weather is another consideration. DC will be a little warmer but humidity can be awful when it gets hotter. NYC also gets muggy but you'll get a little more seasonal variety.\n\nAthletics/Campus Culture: Georgetown has a better campus culture. There's more unity between students, being a Hoya, etc. Better athletic teams (Georgetown men's basketball). It seems a little more close-knit. Columbia has less of a unified culture. Our athletic teams are not name-brand and our athletic facilities, while nice, are not near campus (except for basketball). There is definitely a stress culture\u2014which also exists at Georgetown\u2014but certainly more intense here from what I know. \n\nGeorgetown is gonna be whiter and preppier, while Columbia is less white (but still white) and less preppy. Columbia also has more international students. \n\nThe last thing about this is that you might find some interesting Georgetown dynamics where students in the School of Foreign Service feel themselves to be superior as Georgetown certainly has a reputation itself as a school for future politicians. In that way, there are also certain dynamics between the undergraduate colleges (SFS vs. Business vs. College vs Health Science). Columbia doesn't have such a social organization because it's only Columbia College, the engineering school, and General Studies \\[nontraditional undergrads, mostly veterans and former dancers\\]. You'll also have a really close relationship with Barnard (Women's College right across the street) which I have found very edifying (and you can use their facilities). All Columbia students have really unique trajectories that are often niche but spun in an exciting way. There isn't a single archetype, likely due to the less pre-determined outcomes because you can take the most disparate subjects at the same time.  \n\n Columbia **absolutely** has better food though.",

            "comment": "Both are great schools; you can't go wrong. One thing about Columbia is that we have students from all over the world, and there are tons of cultural/ethnic/racial affinity groups. But I know Georgetown is diverse, too.\n\nTalk to random people at both Columbia and Georgetown; see how they like it. Tours and admitted students' events are going to give you a curated version of the schools. Visit the places and go up and talk to people. Could you see yourself there for four years? Do you fit in with the vibe of the campus?\n\nFit is definitely more important than the nominal difference in prestige.",

    "postText": "Hey! Has anyone here taken Linear Algebra with Marco Castronovo? I'm thinking about taking his course and would love to get a headstart on certain topics in the syllabus bc I'm not very good at math. Is there anyone who can share the syllabus with me? It would mean so much, thank you!",

            "comment": "&gt;Textbook We will use Linear algebra with applications 5th edition by Otto Bretscher. The textbook has been placed on reserve at the Mathematics Library. The lectures will not follow the textbook closely, but reading assignments and homework will be drawn from this text.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Contents The course will have three parts and, if time permits, a shorter optional fourth part. Part I will cover: linear equations and systems, Gauss elimination, matrices, rank and nullity, determinants. Part II will cover: vector spaces and dimension, linear operators, inner products and length, orthogonality, unitary operators. Part III will cover: eigenvalues and eigenvectors, diagonal form of self-adjoint operators, diagonalization of general operators. Part IV (optional) will cover: generalized eigenvectors, Jordan form of general operators. We will have some guest talks by people using linear algebra in applications such as neuroscience and computer animation.\n\nRelevant textbook sections: 1.1-1.3, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1-3.4, 4.1-4.3, 5.1-5.3, 5.5, 6.1-6.2, 7.1-7.3, 8.1\n\nHe assigns a homework after every lecture and (essentially) takes one question from each homework, changes the numbers/dimensions a bit, and puts it in the midterm.",

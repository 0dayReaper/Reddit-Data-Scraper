    "postText": "I was recently admitted into the class of 2027 at Columbia. I am still deciding between Northwestern and Columbia, so I wanted to hop on here to get some of my questions answered. I come from a high school that had one AP class and courses that, mostly, were not rigorous. I took every honors or college class that was offered, but I know that a lot of other high schools have a more difficult curriculum. I am wondering if anyone went from a school like mine to Columbia and what the adjustment was like. I\u2019ve heard bad things about the core curriculum, but I like what I\u2019ve found from my online research about it. How many classes do most people take a semester? Do you get enough sleep to feel well rested? Are you able to complete your coursework and still socialize? When in the semester do you start studying for exams? Did you find the core curriculum to be inflexible or could you still take  other classes that interested you? Was the community at Columbia competitive or collaborative? Overall, has your Columbia experience been positive? I know I\u2019ve asked a lot of questions, but I want to make the right choice. There\u2019s so much about a school that you can\u2019t learn from its website. Thank you!",

Yes its hard, but your experience is going to vary wildly based on choices you make like majors, classes, professors, and a slew of other things. Personally, it kicked my ass but I loved it. I managed my social life alright, and found time to get off campus a lot more junior year onwards.",

You just have to be content with starting from the basic introductory courses even as many of your peers who came from better-resources schools skip to higher level classes right off the bat. \n\nThe core is a hit or miss and varies widely between instructors. But generally I wouldn\u2019t worry about it. \n\nPeople generally take between 4-5 courses per semester.\n\nI am chronically sleep deprived but that\u2019s owing to my treacherous time management. \n\nI am definitely still able to socialize but some weeks are busier than others.\n\nWhen I start studying depends on the course and how comfortable I feel. Ranges from the week before to the day of.\n\nI couldn\u2019t skip any core requirements and I still want to double major (for now) so my schedule is pretty rigid and leaves few elective slots.\n\nFind collaborative and supportive friends and it will  make your experience infinitely better.\n\nMy experience so far is alright.

I think answers to the first 4 questions will be the same for both universities. \n\nDon\u2019t worry too much about core bc it will only help you for that planned major.\n\nColumbia feels competitive, but some people really pretend they aren\u2019t trying and make you question your life when they shine.\n\nOverall positive, but covid shutdowns were not fun.

But I also socialize in clubs and classes and at work a ton\n4. Like in march and then may for finals, profs sometimes cancel class in cc to study for midterms/do a review, and finals have blocked out study days\n5. Core is flexible for a core, but infexible compared to like an open curriculum. I love it but if you dont like the idea then reconsider\n6. Its incredibly collaborative. The students themselves are competitive and ambitious people, but in my experience they compete alongside not against each other\n7. Ive absolutely loved it (sophomore in cc)",

I personally have no experienced the competitiveness but I can see why some would feel like that. idk! Columbia is not without flaws but its definitely one of those schools that you can really make your own experience of, which is surprisingly not that common at other colleges in my experience.",

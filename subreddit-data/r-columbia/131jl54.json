(ie \"I need an extra roll of tape asap\" needs.) \n\nother than that Target is probably your best bet -- There's one on 100/columbus or there's a big one in brooklyn. The room essentials line is intended for dorms so it's a bit more affordable. \n\nOther than those, the best ways would be bed bath and beyond or amazon",

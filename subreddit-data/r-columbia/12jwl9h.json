    "postText": "I was admitted to Columbia SEAS a week and a half ago and am considering it alongside Williams College and JHU. I'm planning on majoring in Applied Mathematics at every school. \n\nI'm curious about the strength of the Applied Math department at Columbia. I'm currently \nleaning toward Williams College for various reasons, but am still strongly considering Columbia. I like that Columbia has a higher depth of courses in my interest fields (AI/ML, Financial Eng/Quant, Applied Math applications in Medicine), but I prefer a lot of the soft factors of Williams. \n\nIf Any APAM majors or people familiar with SEAS could give their thoughts and opinions I would appreciate it greatly!\n\nThank you!",

It sounds like he has a good amount of room to pick and choose classes that interest him (he used it to get into Environmental Sci/Eng. stuff and hydrology) alongside the necessary requirements.",

    "postText": "I have an option to take LitHum or a 3000 level literature course and I\u2019m not sure exactly what to do. \n\nOn one hand, I\u2019ve heard LitHum is really the foundation of the core &amp; tbh I would like to have at some point in my education have read those classics. But I\u2019ve also heard that the course (at least for some) was just a class where everyone BSs and sparknotes it. Also the pace at which books are gone through just seems like a recipe for surface level nonsense. Maybe it\u2019s just too much work for nothing? \n\nI have no idea what 3000 level course I would do, but I\u2019ve heard good things about Canterbury Tales for example, so maybe compare it to that (unless you have recommendations), but also other recommendations are great too. \n\nAny thoughts? Is LitHum worth it?",

The reading can get quite intense but if you are interested in having a foundation in the \"classics\" then you can't go wrong with LitHum. If you want to dig deeply into a particular work/author/time period/etc. then I would recommend a literature seminar. LitHum is really more fluffy with a focus on the \"human condition\" and learning how to read literature. At the pace you breeze through works, you really don't have much time to dig deeply into individual passages and works like you would in a traditional literature seminar.",

That said, there\u2019s nothing like it, and with a good prof, you won\u2019t stay at \u201csurface level,\u201d and may well get better analysis than in a 3000 level. But you should be prepared to invest 10hrs a week or more OUTSIDE the class to get the most out of it.",

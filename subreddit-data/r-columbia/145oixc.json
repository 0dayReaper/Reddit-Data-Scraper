    "postText": "During the period of June 12th through the 14th (resuming normal functionality on the 15th), [r/Columbia](https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbia)  will be locked. The community will not be accessible to anyone except  for the mod team. No new posts or content will be possible, and no  existing content will be accessible to the public.\n\n[r/Columbia](https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbia) stands in solidarity with thousands of other subreddits in speaking out against anti-competitive behavior, price-gouging, and the general mismanagement of Reddit by the current executive regime.\n\nSubreddit communities are the source of the content that generates to  Reddit's revenue; from June 12th-14th we will deny Reddit the  (probably tiny) slice of revenue this subreddit generates-- while joining thousands and thousands of other slices.\n\nCollectively, this protest  cannot be ignored.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFAQ   \nQ: Wait, what?    \nA: Please read this news report for an explanation: [https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/reddit-blackout-date-protest-subreddits-b2352492.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/reddit-blackout-date-protest-subreddits-b2352492.html)\n\nQ: What happens if nothing changes?   \nA: Not sure, nobody is really in charge here, so we'll have to see what  happens-- the decisions of managers and executives at Reddit is the  reason for this protest. We would strongly support a reversal of massive  new pricing increases, which are anti-competitive and unfair.  \n\n\nCC mods of r/apolloapp, and also u/iamthatis",

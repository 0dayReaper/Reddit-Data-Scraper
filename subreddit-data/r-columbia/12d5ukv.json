            "comment": "GSer\u2019s pay by the credit, so if you take more credits it\u2019s possible to pay more than CCers. But it also enables us to attend part time, which helps for nontraditional students who need to work a job while earning their degree (that was me for a few years).\n\nThe real difference is that GSers receive almost no financial aid, and what limited aid is NOT need-based, it\u2019s a small merit grant. So TBH I advise people who are low-income and not a veteran or otherwise have external funding sources not to attend GS because it is very easy to accrue hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt just from tuition, let alone living expenses.",

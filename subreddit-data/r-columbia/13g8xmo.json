    "postText": "Hi! I'm a newly admitted sophomore transfer for the class of 26. I've been fencing for five years and would love to continue doing it at Columbia. Are varsity sports teams open for anyone to try out, or do they only take recruits? \n\nI know that Lions fencing is very, very good, so I'm probably no match for anyone on the team. However, I really love fencing and would be ecstatic if I could just participate in practices (maybe serve as a training dummy or practice partner) so I can have an opportunity to fence on campus and be a part of a team. \n\nI appreciate any advice, thanks!",

            "comment": "sorry for the essay. some thoughts:\n\ni was a D1 athlete in wrestling at a different similar-caliber school. Columbia is just my grad school so i haven't played a varsity sport here. a lot of D1 teams make it difficult to walk on because if they do add people to the roster the team can get in trouble if they later don't continue (the adage is \"walk ons walk off\"). since our fencing team is pretty good, you can be sure that most of them have been doing it since they were little and compete at an elite level. walk ons can face even more adversity than recruited athletes depending on team culture\n\ni would recommend talking to someone on the team to see what they say. it may be the case that they are friendly and open to letting you try out; it's different on every team. but if there is a way to do it they would know how best to advise you. you could even try talking to the coaches but a student athlete may be more approachable if you see one around campus. another angle that may help is if you also convince them you will bring up the team GPA. \n\nyou will (over time) have to convince them that you will fully dedicate yourself to fencing, being part of a team, and in the classroom. also that you are teachable. it's a big commitment and can be hard to balance with academics. it was difficult for me to keep my grades up (science major/double major) but you are probably more academically-qualified than i was\n\nif you do decide to pursue it i wish you the best of luck, it sounds like you really have a lot of passion for the sport! it's a rewarding experience",

Thank you to everybody who helped me already, I\u2019m looking forward to coming! and to anyone who might stumble among this later, you ARE GOOD ENOUGH. \n\nOriginal post: \n\nI graduated high school in 2018 with a 3.9 weighted GPA. Went straight to undergrad and grad, but medical issues (epilepsy) and housing issues tanked my GPA graduated both with a 3.48 undergrad and 3.2 grad. During this time, I ran 7 social media accounts, and I became a caretaker for my schizophrenic parent. Aside from this, I was a substitute teacher, and I ran a successful Facebook based business from 13-17. \n\nI applied to Columbia\u2019s SPS and GS, never thinking I\u2019d actually get in. I haven\u2019t heard back from GS (just sent it) but I got into SPS. Since I got in and sent my application to GS, I\u2019ve been dealing with a lot of imposter syndrome, especially regarding my GPA. I don\u2019t feel I\u2019ve done anything spectacular or interesting, and surely there\u2019s more deserving applicants. \n\nDoes this imposter syndrome ever go away?",

I have a pretty solid support system and they constantly remind me I earned my spot \u2014 which helps \u2014 but it\u2019s harder to believe it some days. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll ever fully disappear, even once I graduate, but I\u2019ve slowly accepted my place here. You just have to remind yourself, they saw something in you that perhaps you can\u2019t yet see in yourself. One day, you will.",

Only way to deal best with this is train your mind, train your mind hard to reason out what is the purpose of the question you have in your mind and mitigate all external factors, once you control your mind, you literally can achieve anything and everything.\n\nAnd no matter how many support system you have like friends family and others , the only thing you need to succeed in your own way is push and motivation from within. Trust me, once you figure that out, there is nothing stopping you from achieving whatever you aim for. You just need to self drive yourself a little everytime and you will thank yourself later for your own mental growth.",

I can't even begin to imagine starting a successful Facebook business at 13. The problem is that experience brings the extraordinary to mundanity.\n\nI guess my advice would be to take a step back and imagine if it was your friend telling you all your achievements. Would it still feel like nothing if it was someone else? It definitely won't get *rid* of the imposter syndrome, but it certainly helps(at least for me).\n\nIf all else fails, remember this: those admissions folks read over all your app stuff and admitted you, so clearly you've got what it takes to be here.",

We often think in terms of what people deserve or what they've earned, but, frankly, life isn't fair and it's impossible to know who deserves what. So when something positive happens, count yourself lucky, \"Haha! I can't believe that actually worked!\" or \"Hell yes, I am so persuasive I convinced them to let me in!\" and know that every other good person thinks the same. The only people who don't struggle with imposter syndrome are people that feel entitled to things. \n\nOr maybe I'm wrong. I am my own source on this.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m a PhD student who has a Columbia studio. At the time I got the apartment I was fully planning to live alone, but it now seems possible/likely that my partner will move in when the current lease period ends (he is also a Columbia grad student). The apartment is large, so I\u2019m not worried about space, especially since neither of us has much stuff. \n\nThe housing site is frustratingly vague about couples living in housing that isn\u2019t specifically designated as couples\u2019 housing. Do I actually need to reach out to them and make it \u201cofficial\u201d? Will they ever check? I have friends living with their partners and afaik they\u2019ve been able to slide under the radar. I can always claim that I have a guest staying over if they ever drop by, but I also don\u2019t want to jeopardize my lease.",

Should a partner or any dependent children come to live with you, you must notify Columbia Residential in writing immediately. \n\nNot sure how it would be enforced if you do decide to wing it but I wouldn\u2019t risk it as they do inspect units every now and then!  Besides, I doubt it\u2019ll be a big deal if you just notify them. Hope it helps!",

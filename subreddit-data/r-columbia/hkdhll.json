    "postText": "tldr: if you don\u2019t like Bollinger\u2019s email about next year, burn Butler to the ground or something\n\nGiven the Bollinger email delay and the generally unorganized response, I think it is worth bringing this up. The University is not your friend. As much as they seem to care about your best interest, they don\u2019t. They are most concerned with their bottom line. The bottom line obviously being money, but also retention rate, graduation rate, postgrad employment, etc. \n\nYou might be thinking \u201cbut we have NSOP/Bacchanal/free laundry/or whatever\u201d and I agree those things are nice. However, those aren\u2019t from the school. You paid for those things with your 70k tuition. The meager tuition reimbursement is a great, recent example of the administration\u2019s priorities. They simply didn\u2019t care that you were paying through the nose for online courses.\n\nNow the point of this rant: a professor of mine said something in our last meeting that stuck with me. She urged everyone to speak up if they took issue with the University\u2019s return plan and explained that the professors have almost zero influence. As students, you hold all the cards and it\u2019s your job to use them for your benefit because the professors can\u2019t and the admins won\u2019t. \n\nIf Bollinger\u2019s email sucks, make it known: what about it sucks, how it can be fixed, and what you\u2019ll do if it isn\u2019t. Good luck\n\nDisclaimer: I graduated this year and this is just my dumb opinion so hate on it if you want",

I remember I got a activoty fee adjustment of like $100 or $200 from Fall 2013 in 2020. I called to ask why I had a bill even though I didn't step foot into a class for 3 years (I had to fulfill some requirements outside to graduate) and they said they increased the fee and that's what the extra charge was for.\n\nI told the person on the phone how that made no sense and I could hear the wtf in her voice because she was confused too. After giving me another department to call and sending a bunch of emails, I got fee waived 2 months later. And then i I had late fees on top of that so had to get those fees waived. The late fees weren't much but I wasn't paying them on principle.",

But that's not consistent with the size of the administration, or the pedagogical deskilling of faculty coming from the focus on research output. (Do you know a single Columbia professor hired in the last 30 years who was hired because they're an excellent teacher?) \n\nWe could argue about what they're actually in the business of (eg, one might argue that the notion of \"the college experience\" was invented to counteract the fact that professors mostly can't teach for shit; or that what they're selling is the credential, and the focus on research is to increase the value of that credential \\[\"prestige\"\\] despite its lack of relevance to the actual education; or that they're just building an image to rake in that sweet endowment money so they can run their little hedge fund; and I'm sure there's narratives I'm not seeing here), but it's a lot more complicated than education.",

    "postText": "I recently found out that I won't be able to attend the May 17 commencement ceremony, so I'm selling my master's cap and gown.\n\nThe cap and gown are in great condition and have only been worn once for my graduation photos. I'm willing to sell them for a fair price and also throw in two guest tickets for the ceremony.\n\nIf you or someone you know is interested, please feel free to reach out to me. I'm happy to answer any questions you may have and provide additional photos if needed.\n\nThanks for your time and congratulations to all of the graduates!",

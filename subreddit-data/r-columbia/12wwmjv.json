I'm thinking of majoring in Data Science and want to know your opinions on the best sequence to take:\n\n1.) **INTRO TO COMP FOR ENG/APP SCI (Python)** then **ESSENTIAL DATA STRUCTURES (C)**\n\n2.)  **Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in MATLAB** then **ESSENTIAL DATA**   \n**STRUCTURES (C)**\n\n***or*** 3.)  **Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Java** then **Data Structures in Java** \n\nThanks All!",

                    "comment": "Thanks Porthos! I had considered that. But part of my concern was that Python would be taught in higher level courses anyways. For example, I do not believe there is a class on R, yet the language seems to be used pretty heavily in Columbia AI course. If Python is equally foundational to Machine Learning and other such subjects as is R, it may be redundant to take an introductory course on Python. Especially if doing so means I miss out on learning a language (Java) which may be able to help me build android apps and other cool stuff. Thoughts?",

Idk what your programming background is, but jumping from Py to C for data structures will be a rough transition if you're unfamiliar with either.\n\nJumping from MATLAB to C would probably also be an awkward transition for similar reasons.\n\nI recommend option 3 for consistency. Java is simple enough that it's a good first language to get comfortable with, intricate enough that it will make learning Py a breeze down the line, and C-like enough that an eventual jump to C is doable.",

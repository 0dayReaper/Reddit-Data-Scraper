Were there any AP exams that you either regret not taking or are glad that you did? Or are they all worthless?",

That way when you get to school, you don\u2019t have to waste as much time on required courses that you don\u2019t want to take and instead spend time on classes related to your major !",

BC is the best because you can skip Calc 1 and Calc 2 - Calc 2 is especially tedious from what I\u2019ve heard. AP Chem can get you into Honors Chem or Orgo which may be helpful depending on your major. If you do well on Micro and Macro you can escape Principles of Econ (required only in SEAS). Otherwise, just having non-techs was helpful for me in SEAS and reduced the raw number of courses I had to take substantially \n\n\nThis explains the SEAS rules very well: https://bulletin.engineering.columbia.edu/advanced-placement",

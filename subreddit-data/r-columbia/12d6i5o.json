            "comment": "This gets pedantic about details, but I study Art History so go figure.\n\n**Is Columbia's Crown the English Crown?**\n\nHistorically, that would make sense; Columbia *was* founded by the United Kingdom. That being said, there are important details that are absent on Columbia's crown. If Columbia's Crown were modeled after any crown, it would be [St Edward's Crown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Edward%27s_Crown). St Edward's Crown is the main crown jewel of the United Kingdom. It was crafted in the 17th century and has been the centerpiece crown of the United Kingdom since. Similar-looking crowns were used since the 13th century. Atop its band are alternating fleurs-de-lis (lilys) and crosses patt\u00e9e (crosses). The fleurs-de-lis are important in the British Crown because it was originally a French symbol. Their inclusion on the crown asserts the British's claim to the French throne\u2014originally asserted in the 12th century. All British crowns have included fleurs-de-lis since they were originally used.\n\nColumbia's crown looks *similar*, but it's *not identical*. It has crosses patt\u00e9e but it lacks fleurs-de-lis. It also lacks a velvet cap. It's been this way since the crown adorned the first college building in 1760. Considering the history of the New World at the time\u2014the Seven Years' War began in May 1754\u2014the absence of fleurs-de-lis seems to break from an expected pattern of heraldry, especially during a time of tension against the French.\n\nIt's an interesting question, and I couldn't find any crown around the time that it looked like or any reason why that symbol would be absent. So you can say the crowns are similar, maybe that it's a crown sponsored by the British, but it's not the English crown.\n\nBut that feels buried in academic and symbolic defense.\n\n**So, why use the crown following the revolution?**\n\nColumbia's crown saw its rise to a main college symbol at the turn of the 20th century in an attempt to promote school spirit by looking back at its history and searching for symbols. Imperialism and oppression weren't concerns at the time and this probably seemed like another way to assert some classical and prolonged aspect to itself.\n\nToday, there are a few things we can consider: Does Columbia actively combat imperialism and oppression, whether in its student body or institution? Whether this means supporting republican/democratic values, social/civic/political rights that go against the monarchy, and/or working against oppression. If you think so, perhaps view the crown as a reversal of power\u2014that it draws the outside in and turns the inside out. There are students here that certainly whose family was certainly scored by the British crown, but they're able to succeed here. So is this a transformation akin to the reclamation of the Pink Triangle in the LGBT community? Or is it some loyalist vein endured 200 years later.\n\nOr, maybe, students tend to focus on action over design\u2014work over performance/presentation. Certain central symbols will remain at institutions; UPenn won't change its affiliation with Benjamin Franklin despite his relationship with the slave trade, nor will Yale with Elihu Yale.\n\nAll that being said, I would love it if the University promoted more diverse symbols for the school\u2014especially if it means better merch lol.",

Columbia, comes from \"Land of Columbus\", referring to a man who started the colonization of America. So should the university rename itself?\n\nFar better to acknowledge and own it, take it as a mantle of responsibility to be better and reshape the legacy of the crown and the name.\n\nAlso, if you've seen the Columbia bookstore most of the merch is devoid of the crown. The university would rather be referred to as \"C\" or \"CU\" than use the crown. Which is a shame because as someone who's not concerned by a 200 year old symbol, the crown added a little bit of prestige and pride.",

The crown-sign has lost this original meaning long ago and the beauty of it is that now it is just the university logo and nothing more. It has been emptied of its signification.

    "postText": "Hi - as the title indicates, I recently tried applying for Couples housing (before the priority deadline) and the system automatically let me know that they aren\u2019t accepting further applications due to high demand.\n\nI sent Housing Services an email - as an incoming international student from New Zealand, I\u2019m not sure what options I have as I\u2019ve heard getting a lease off campus isn\u2019t easy for non residents. Neither my partner nor I have US accounts set up or a credit score, and I\u2019m also really unfamiliar with what the locations are like as a non-local in terms of safety/accessibility, although I\u2019ve been trying to do some research around this. I would really prefer being in the Columbia housing system, given that I don\u2019t really have the ability to scope out and vet off campus properties, and I don\u2019t want to be stuck in a housing situation I won\u2019t be able to easily terminate or transfer out of. The advantage of being in the Columbia system is being able to transfer, which is important to my partner and I.\n\nTo be honest I was disappointed with the response from housing services, all they did was direct me to their off campus listings. Based on previous responses in this Reddit I assumed we wouldn\u2019t have an issue securing couples housing, and I was also under the assumption that international students and out of town folk are prioritised. They haven\u2019t really offered me/my partner any options outside of this.\n\nAnyone else having the same issue or have advice?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m a Mailman student, not sure if that\u2019s relevant!",

            "comment": "I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with it. Moving as a new student can be quite stressful on its own. I am a GS student, and have the same issue (it should be easier for you as a grad-student though). Last year, I got approved for housing as a first year student, but because of high demand for couple housing, even when it was my appointment to choose, there was no housing available, so I did not get housing (yes, as you can guess, the housing office was not helpful at all and said if there is no housing, there is no housing). This year, I applied again the first day applications opened for fall, but have not heard anything from them yet, and probably will get moved to waitlist. So from my personal experience, look into campus housing, but don\u2019t only rely on that. Check street easy for housing available (off campus). Do you qualify for any disability services in Columbia? Can housing be necessary for you as an accommodation ? If it is, go ahead with that. You will have a higher chance. Also, the off campus market is pretty crazy. Do not sign any lease before you get here, and see the apartment in person.",

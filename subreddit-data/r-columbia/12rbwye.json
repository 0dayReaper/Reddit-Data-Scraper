    "postText": "Hello! I was recently accepted to Columbia (accepted RD to study Data Science) and also just sentenced to four years in federal prison (convicted for 2 counts of identity theft). I'm deciding now between attending Columbia while evading the authorities or serving out my sentence.\n\nI know both institutions offer access to an impressive network of high-achieving go-getters, but I'm a bit unsure on the finer details. My biggest dilemmas are cost of living and internships: not needing to pay for housing or a meals at New York prices seems like a great deal, but I doubt that I can get the same internships or professor quality from the federal prison system that I could at Columbia.\n\nCan anyone give me some pros and cons regarding this choice?\n\nThank you in advance for your advice!",

            "comment": "Federal prison 100%, here's why: \n\n1. Columbia's DS program is mediocre and not nearly as selective as federal prison (0.05% acceptance rate). They only recruit the best of the best, like [Harvard-educated math professors and published authors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaczynski).\n2. New York City is expensive, full-stop. Even [ham-and-cheese sandwiches here cost $29](https://gothamist.com/news/why-does-this-ham-and-cheese-cost-29-at-a-manhattan-shop-an-investigation). Prisons give you three square meals a day and free housing. Think about how much debt you'll be taking on just trying to feed yourself. The ROI from a Columbia degree will not be enough to make it up, even if you make it to quant/IB/MBB.\n3. Columbia's administration is the worst. Endless back-and-forth emails, waitlists, and paperwork just to get a simple course added to your schedule. In federal prison, they don't have all that fussy tech and bureaucracy. The schedules are simple and straightforward. All communication is face-to-face and personable.\n\nThe choice here is really clear.",

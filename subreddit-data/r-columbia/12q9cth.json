For example, if you treat school like a work week, and let\u2019s say grind from 9am-6/7pm M-Th every week, you can easily get friday-sunday to chill and explore the city. \n\nOf course it\u2019s not perfect, and I personally don\u2019t do that and choose to grind on sunday and relax a little throughout the week, but the point is that I think the workload is reasonable provided you aren\u2019t killing yourself with 21 credits, and all of my friends say the same. There are endless opportunities in NYC, and it\u2019s so easy to go work in a park downtown on a nice day, or go to the NY public library if you need a change of scenery in studying.",

Obviously it is different person to person but I have found a disproportionately large presence of students who are not genuine and/or don\u2019t have a passion in anything. Despite this, almost everyone here is incredibly smart and driven. This combo leads to a lot of kids working hard towards something they have little interest in which just seems so strange to me",

I was really shocked to find out that a lot of students weren\u2019t too interested in being at a good academic institution and were more focused on getting an Ivy on their resume. I would assume that for a majority of (undergrad) students, Columbia is nothing more than a stepping stone to making as much money as a 20-something-yr-old can. It, like the infinite clubs and accomplishments of high school, is only a temporary chapter and a means to an end. \n\nAll of that said though I want to emphasize that this is not at all necessarily the case. The cool thing about this school and this city is that you can do whatever the hell you want. You want to grind for 4 yrs so that you can get into a prestigious bank and grind more? Go ahead! Columbia can help u do that. You want to dick around for 4 years? No worries, Columbia passes everyone. (No joke some departments the profs have to get approval to give you below a B) You want to do literally anything else? Try it. \n\nMy point is this: I am convinced that 99% of people will never have the freedom and opportunity of a Columbia undergrad. I have so far squandered mine and I\u2019m not alone. There is no prescribed way to spend 4 yrs here, so I would encourage anyone to just try shit",

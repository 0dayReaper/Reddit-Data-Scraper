    "postText": "Hi, I recently got accepted into Columbia's Academic Success Program, including a summer camp  and they're basically paying for my tuition too and I couldn't be more thrilled and excited to go to Columbia!! I was wondering if any of you have had experiences in these academic success programs and how they went. Also, my school offered some courses to earn some college credits from SUNY Westchester Community College, so I was wondering if any of you also have some experience for transferring credits from SUNYs to Columbia because i looked in both sites but the answers were mostly vague and confusing to me. Thank you!!",

You can get credit from some AP exams:\n\n[This is the 2022-2023 Academic Planning Guide](https://www.cc-seas.columbia.edu/sites/dsa/files/handbooks/2022-2023%20APG%20final.pdf) and on pages 15-16, 26-27 you'll find the courses you can get AP credit for. I'll also send you a FGLI guide you might find useful.",

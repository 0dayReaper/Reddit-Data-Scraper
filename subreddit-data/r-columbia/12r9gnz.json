It doesn't list any required prerequisites but I thought Id ask, has anyone taken this class before and if so is it okay if this is my first philosophy class?",

                            "comment": "you will have to check the syllabus. it just depends on the paradoxes you guys will be looking at. if its only mathematical paradoxes, you should be fine. but for stuff like semantic paradoxes you might need some background knowledge in the philosophy of language? but if youre solid at math, there wont be much catch up needed. i think content-wise you should be fine.\n\nhowever, i think one thing thats being overlooked is the ability to write a good philosophy paper. it seems like haim has high standards for those so if you havent written phil papers before you might suffer. contemporary philosophy papers have a really distinct style and its very different from english papers.\n\nif you are looking for a true humanities experience, paradoxes is definitely not it! a lot of contemporary philosophy classes tends towards logic and math so if youre looking for something more closely approximating to the philosophy we here about on the news e.g. existentialism, stoicism, marxism, etc., id recommend turning your eyes towards the comparative literature/language departments\u2013 they offer some great classes!\n\ndm me for more info :)",

A lot of these courses aren't something you can just jump into without at least a basic knowledge of philosophy, and probably more than that. But that said, hey maybe give it a shot, I dunno. Maybe it would be easier and more fun than a basic metaphysics course.",

Definitely get in contact with the professor, tell them your situation (areas of specialization, course load for the semester) and take it from there. Also, discuss the possibility of auditing or doing Pass/Fail/No Credit, if you really want to take it.",

I would think that most of your classmates will be in the philosophy program, but there might be STEM majors doing coursework related to philosophy of science. Prerequisites aren't listed, but you'll likely need a crash course in Western philosophy, particularly in relation to scientific innovation. Check to see what the background of the professor teaching the course. If their research includes STEM topics, you should be okay. If their interests seem more skewed in the direction of humanities, it might be more work. Regardless, get ready though for lots of reading and writing!",

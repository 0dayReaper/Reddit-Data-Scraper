    "postText": "Did anyone take Lucas Cohen for Art Hum? If so, could you share your final exam notes with me please. I missed a large chunk of class due to personal reasons. He told me the exam will consist of 9 comparisons and 2 concept identifications. \n\nIt doesn't have to be Lucas Cohen. Really any art hum notes for the final exam would be really helpful.\n\nThank you in advance!",

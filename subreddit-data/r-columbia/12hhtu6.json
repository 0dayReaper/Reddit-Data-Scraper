I had an Aetna plan in undergrad that was meh; my current employer insurance is very good but obviously I'll be losing that as a full-time grad if I do come in the fall, so I wanted to gauge opinions on what Columbia provides.  Any info appreciated, especially from people that see specialists and the like.",

The important thing to know is that it is an HMO and that Columbia Health services is your primary care, meaning you need a referral from them to see anyone. Luckily, it is pretty easy to get a referral, but they aren\u2019t reallyyy a real primary care provider and are not equipped to do so, so I would keep that in mind. Beyond that I have no idea",

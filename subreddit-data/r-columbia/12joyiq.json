    "postText": "current CS junior, will want to apply to the MS Express program(CS) next year. For now I have 3 cores to go and I plan to finish 2 over the next year. I wonder if \n\na. I can clear the last one during the MS Express program.  \n\nb. I can count the many CS courses I'm taking now to MS degree &amp; take philosophy/math classes during MS Express and count those towards the undergrad degree. \n\nThanks!!",

            "comment": "I don't think either of these are possible. You need to be completely done with your bachelor's before starting your master's even if you're applying through MS Express. While you can count CS classes from your undergrad for the MS if you take an excess number of upper-level CS courses, you can't do the opposite and finish your undergrad requirements as a grad student.",

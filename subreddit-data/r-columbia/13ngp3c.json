    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI will be attending my first semester at Columbia in the fall (GS) and have currently been approved for housing. The difficulty with it is that there are absolutely no pictures of any of the units. For me this creates an extra layer of anxiety that overall seems a bit unnecessary - like why no pictures? Honestly, most don't even have floor plans to look at. I was wondering if anyone who currently lives there has any information, or pictures of any of the units. Currently I am looking into 500 West 122nd and 524 West 122nd. Also open to other ideas! Again, if anyone has any information especially pictures I would be so grateful! Thank you!!!",

            "comment": "UGH YES, it sucks there are no pictures, had to go through the same thing. I contacted my future flatmate (there should be some contact info on the portal if someone lives there) and asked her to send pictures. It was easier because i moved in in the Spring semester, but you should give it a try! Have a friend who used to live on 524 W 122nd, and she mentioned that her apartment was pretty big but no pictures, unfortunately. Also, try to reach out to housing people and ask them for a floor - plan. \n\n  \nBesides that, i live on 122nd and love it. Very close to campus and pretty quiet; there are many grocery stores nearby and a bus stop if you feel lazy to walk to a subway station (it is kind of in between 116 and 125, so you will not get bored too quickly of going to the same one lol). \n\nCan't help with pictures, but feel free to reach out :)",

What are some pros and cons of staying in Upper Manhattan vs NJ ?\n\nIn New Jersey, Hoboken, Weehawken, Union City seem to be the best places to rent. As they are near the Lincoln tunnel. I know the biggest con for NJ is the commute time. Apart from that do I miss out on anything if I stay in nj academically, socially \u2026..",

Takes you straight to port authority and then you can hop on the 1 train straight to Columbia. If you time it correctly, it should take 40-45 minutes. Not terrible but as others have said, it does kind of get boring when you\u2019re so far from campus, and when you do want to do something in the city (especially late at night when the buses don\u2019t run as frequently), it can become a pain. Happy to chat over dm if you have questions",

But in Weehawken atleast, there are bus stops virtually at every street corner, so I only had to walk 50 ft from my apartment to the bus stop. The bus takes you directly to port authority (which has the 1 train transfer in the basement so you don\u2019t even have to leave the building). I never had an issue with safety",

            "comment": "The commute from Hoboken / Jersey city really wouldn\u2019t be that bad nor would you miss out on much because of the commute. \n\nIf you were in Hoboken/JC they have the PATH station right there that goes straight into the city. You could either get off at WTC or take the line that goes to Penn station (recommended). Once there, just walk 1 block to the subway, get on the 2/3 uptown express, switch at 96th to the 1 express, and you\u2019re at Columbia. \n\nThe commute is really only ~45 minutes depending on walking distance to the PATH, and whether or not you hit the trains sequentially and don\u2019t have to wait long in between. I can typically get to/from CU in 20 minutes to/from Penn. Just put headphones in, listen to a podcast, or download some assigned reading of some sort to your phone and read. It\u2019ll go by quickly.\n\nI always get hate for recommending NJ, but there\u2019s a reason so many people (400,000) get jobs in NYC and commute from NJ. The costs are just way too high.",

He teaches the lecture portion of the course so I interact more with the TAs than him but every time I\u2019ve asked him questions after the lectures, he\u2019s always been really nice and helpful. His lectures are pretty interesting too although sometimes I feel like there are a little too many digressions that can make the lesson hard to follow, but overall, I think he\u2019s been a really engaging and nice Professor!",

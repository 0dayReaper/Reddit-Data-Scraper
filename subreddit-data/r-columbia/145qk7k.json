    "postText": "So I did my bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering in India but I want to do MS in Data Science, what are the things I should know before starting my masters in data science so i don't get a complete shock looking at the syllabus. I had no computer related courses in my bachelor's so a thorough answer would be really helpful, like the math i need to know before getting into masters, the programming languages all that stuff that one should know before starting his masters in DS.\nPlease share your experiences....",

You will finish your MS, and find yourself among an ocean full of PhDs in Data Science, and will always struggle with your career growth, in finding opportunities, and professional growth. If you want to, you can directly apply for a PhD program and skip the MS entirely. Or consider a different field. MechE are wanted a lot here too with tons of opportunities.",

Both MS and PhD are considered as graduate degrees and unlike in other countries, there isn't a requirement to do an MS first before PhD. \n\nBut in your case, he's looking for a total switch in his track, so he'd have a very difficult time getting an admit from any University, while it's possible though. I am fairly certain you haven't talked to many DS graduates. My friend quit her job in my company to pursue her MS in Data Science, and she's just months away from graduating, and she realized her mistake and is going into a PhD program, for another 6 or 7 more years. While an MS program certainly gets you a lot of course work in, you still have to pay your dues for the PhD program, namely course requirements, research requirements, publication requirements etc. PhD work in Data Science isn't easy and is very very heavy in programming too that even most CS and CompE grads don't have the heart for. I sincerely advice for you to reconsider. Also Columbia is one of the most expensive University in the US, so unless you mint money in India, this is the most ridiculous way to go about applying for grad school.",

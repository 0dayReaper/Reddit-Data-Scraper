    "postText": "Hi\u2014wondering if there are any other older GS students or grad students interested in connecting. I am 32, queer, male, finishing up my second part time year, computer science major, and haven't met anyone at the school. I live in Brooklyn and work so I tend to just go to school in the evenings and go immediately home but I would really love to come out on the other end of this with some friends and connections and have some sort of school community while I'm here.",

I\u2019m part time as well and am an astrophysics major. I\u2019m a commuter student from NJ and work full time so I don\u2019t do much either other than school and work.",

Part of it is that I have a whole real life with my husband that\u2019s completely separate from school. And on top of that, the overhead of living is higher because we just have more responsibilities. Sometimes I wish that GS had ways for us olds to connect, but in reality we probably wouldn\u2019t have the time or energy to do it.\n\nBut I\u2019ve had luck just meeting people in my classes. I don\u2019t know how it is outside of STEM, but you will start seeing the same people in your classes. This fall I know 3 other people (at least) registered for one of my Math classes.",

Maybe you could check if Barnard\u2019s AMEC is affiliated to Columbia EALAC or MESAAS, or if, as a Barnard student you can directly major in either at Columbia. Generally there\u2019s a lot of diversity within the program, but more people are likely to continue their studies in a grad school or law school.",

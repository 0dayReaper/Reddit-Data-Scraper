I selected my preferences weeks ago, I just need to review and submit that's all. Is this just some kind of normal temporary problem that I should wait out, or should I contact housing?\n\nAlso, any incoming students had this problem before? Thanks\n\nEdit: Apparently you have to activate your UNI and log into the housing portal using that instead of your CUID.",

            "comment": "I don't recommend buying your Lit Hum books far in advance, because yes, your professor may deviate from the official syllabus; also, though this wasn't your question, it's important to try to use the same translation/edition as the rest of the class. It is just pointlessly confusing, for example, to try to follow class discussion with your mom's old copy of *Pride and Prejudice* that isn't divided into three volumes and has completely different page numbers.\n\nIf you're thinking of reading ahead--it's not necessary and won't be particularly helpful. Sure, you can have a look at the Iliad; you'll want to have read the first six books before class begins, but they should be fairly fresh in your mind.",

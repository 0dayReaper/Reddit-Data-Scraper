Then tell your parents that you are going to Columbia once all of the paperwork is squared away - then they have a whole other year to kind of digest the situation, so that they can fill out financial aid for you next year as well.",

But in filing financial aid for next year you will need your parents info. If you have your health insurance info you should be able to see if it covers what Columbia requires or if you will need to purchase theirs. Ask financial aid to help with that if needed. And you should have access to your own immunization records to upload/input - parents didn\u2019t sign anything if I\u2019m remembering correctly. My freshman kid had an awesome year. Congrats!",

Search A2C you should find additional info as some kids do have uncooperative parents at times. Frankly I'm surprised so many kids have to go through this - I'd understand if the school was providing no aid and they want to keep their child from taking on crippling debt but in a lot of cases schools are being generous, but parents are still adamant about keeping them close to home! Sending you good vibes and hope you and your parents can come to a resolution.",

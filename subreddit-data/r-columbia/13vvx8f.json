    "postText": "Hey, if anyone is taking Chinese Foreign Politics with Dr. Christensen in the Fall of 2023, let me know! I have all the books required for his Fall 2022 class. I am a veteran student and was given the textbooks for free, so I would like to pass them along to someone else who financially cannot afford it. Please don't take the books with the intention of selling them. I want to help others in our community. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

    "postText": "Many reasons why the university might be one of the most ableist\u2026 given it\u2019s in NYC which is hard to navigate already. but right now the whole campus is obstructed the past two weeks and next week because of construction for commencement. There is only two tiny paths (with trucks and people standing, children playing) to get around the center of campus. Also more loud and obstructive construction on Amsterdam. It\u2019s very inconvenient for everyone but impossible for people who need more accessibility. Sure it\u2019s for safety but I don\u2019t think people with disabilities can feel safe on campus rn. I definitely don\u2019t.",

Why isn't Columbia getting sued every year for failing ADA compliance? Why are students not up in arms about this?",

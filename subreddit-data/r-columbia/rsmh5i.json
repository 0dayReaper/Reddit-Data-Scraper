    "postText": "Columbia is a top school, but it hasn't reached the level of prestige it deserves among the general populace. Clearly, current college students (and their parents) who have recently gone through the admissions process are aware of Columbia\u2019s grand stature. At the mere mention of our school, their eyes widen with respect, and they eagerly commend us for attending such an elite and selective institution: \"Columbia? No way! How did you get in?\" \"Wow, you must be very smart.\" \"Congrats, I hope to send my kid there one day.\" \"Please. Take my daughter's hand in marriage.\" This is how it should be.\n\nUnfortunately, the older, uncultured plebeians of our society are teeming with ignorance. I seethe with godly anger when my family friends don't collapse onto their knees when I mention my college, or when my neighbors question why I would choose to study in New York when we have a community college and state school so nearby. Peasants. How can they be so obtuse? How long do you think it will take for the unwashed masses to learn about our illustrious history and academic prowess? 5 years? 10? 20?",

It has to sit under a radiator in John Jay Hall for at least 72 hours. Then, leave it at the feet of Alma as offering. Proper application of this ritual will prevent the spirit of your advisor from haunting you during your senior year.\n\nFor extra potency, you can substitute the bubble tea for the tears of a premed student studying for Orgo.\n\nIn reality, Columbia is like a fucked-up version of Spirited Away, but instead of taking away your name, they give you a uni, CUIT is Kamaji and Lee Bollinger is Yubaba. And instead of bath tokens, you get sweet financial aid cash to bribe your way around.",

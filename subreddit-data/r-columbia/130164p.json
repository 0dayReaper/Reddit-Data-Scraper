Heli is a really chill professor and all homework is gone over in class and not graded, so you'll get out of it whatever you want to put in. most of the time in class we're going through the textbook, doing exercises in small groups, watching TV / the news in swedish, sharing stories about / just talking about swedish culture, etc. there isn't that much talking, but i think that's probably going to be more a 3rd/4th semester thing. \n\ni think the class is pretty easy, but i should mention that i was already decently capable in the language (able to make general small talk, have focused conversations about specific topics, and get around sweden entirely in swedish) before i took the class. feel free to DM me if you have any questions, but if you're trying to get in in the fall (i.e. swedish 3) you're probably going to have to have a very good foundation in swedish for Heli to let you in.",

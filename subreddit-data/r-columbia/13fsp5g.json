It was pretty precisely split, and we had two midterms, no cumulative final. I do know some people who took Honors A and switched to accelerated multi in the second semester (mostly for reasons the other commenter mentioned, too much effort if your goal is just to learn calc) without any trouble, so that's another option if you want something more rigorous than the usual track. Not sure if that was helpful, but I'm happy to answer any other questions!",

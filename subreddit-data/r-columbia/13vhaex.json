Has anyone had experience with any of these courses being accepted for even elective credit, especially considering how math is usually standardized?",

It is possible to, for example, skip Calc I in some majors if you have an A-range grade in a year-long high school calculus class, but you don't get credit for it.",

The Academic Resources Fair, held during orientation (NSOP), would be a good place to get some answers about what you should do about math. You should speak to the representatives of whatever department(s) you're considering for your program of study. There will also be a Math Department info session during NSOP.",

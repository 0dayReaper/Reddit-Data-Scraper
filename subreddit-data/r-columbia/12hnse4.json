            "comment": "That seems like a pretty ambitious courseload since there's going to be pretty minimal overlap between those 3 areas. You should expect the core to be about 1/3 of your classes, your major to be 1/3, and the last 1/3 free, give or take. I would look at the course offering bulletin to make sure that schedule is physically possible first. If it's possible, it definitely won't be particularly easy and is not super conducive to getting a high GPA (Econ classes curve to somewhere a little below a 3.33). Why do you want to do econ with pre-med?",

You can place out of Principles of Econ and Calculus I with AP/IB credit, and you could also take fewer than 4 language classes via AP or departmental placement test. At best, that's 34 classes which is more reasonable too.",

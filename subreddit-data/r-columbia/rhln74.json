If you were deferred/denied or are still applying, please do not make posts or discuss admissions, as is a rule on this subreddit. Also, misinformation and defamatory talk regarding the four undergraduate colleges is also not allowed on this server. If you are unfamiliar with any of these rules, please consult our rules icon. Thanks!",

You are excluding the transfer of knowledge from POC and first gens.",

It\u2019s about the goings on at the University, and if you\u2019re interested in admissions, you should be using pages dedicated to that and/or reaching out to students in the Admissions offices who will give you their perspective. There are many organizations on our campus that deal directly with FGLI and minority admissions and the culture on campus. You can find those groups by literally looking at our club directory. Our rule on no admissions discussion has always existed. If you or anyone continue to break these rules, you will be removed from the subreddit alongside your posts.",

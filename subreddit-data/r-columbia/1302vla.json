    "postText": "Hello Columbia students, if you\u2019re planning to go home for the summer but still have an apartment lease, I am looking to sublet for the summer! I am a 20 year old guy (21 in early June) looking to move to the city to pursue a career in music. I am clean, respectful, and don\u2019t have pets or a car. The earliest I can move in would be may 15th. Feel free to reach out to me on here if you\u2019re interested, thanks!",

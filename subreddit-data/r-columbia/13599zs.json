            "comment": "The homeworks were completion based, there were 3 exams, two in class and a take home one which was essentially another Problem Set but graded for accuracy. \n\nWeekly reflections which she gives a template for and if you stick to it you're fine. The exams were pretty mid, if you are finding the topics enjoyable then it will most likely be fine. My only real complaint was that she talked a little too slow for my liking, I was able to play the lectures back at 2x speed and still understand her perfectly, which may end up being a plus. She's a nice prof overall\n\n8/10 :)) if you have any other questions feel free to follow-up !",

    "postText": "I am a rising senior at Barnard seeking off-campus housing in the fall semester (September move-in, as near campus as possible). I have been scrolling various Facebook pages and housing websites, but have not found anything helpful. It seems that most posts right now are for summer sublets. \n\nI want to ask what is a good time to start looking for fall housing, and whether there will be something available later on the market. I know it might be too early to ask about September move-in rent, but also have the anxiety of not finding anything when the date gets closer. Thank you in advance!",

            "comment": "Rental turnaround and searches in nyc are usually skewed towards a more truncated timeline\u2014 very few people will be posting sublets or lease takeovers right now, but check back in mid-July/early August (it\u2019s really stressful, just a fact of nyc rental market). \n\nAre you looking to sign a lease? If so, those will also want your signing the lease date and move in date as close together as possible. They\u2019ll usually ask you to move in asap or within the next week or two? From my experience. \n\nSome people are posting lease takeovers rn but they\u2019re looking for people who can start now - next year, so maybe you can hop onto a lease takeover and then find a summer subletter?",

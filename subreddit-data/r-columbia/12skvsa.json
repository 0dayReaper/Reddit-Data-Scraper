We've gained over 3k+ active users!\n\nOne of my friend at columbia tried it and thinks it's pretty good in some cases, here are some use cases:\n\n1. upload your lithum readings and start asking questions about it\n2. upload a research paper and go through it via chatting\n3. upload youtube links of lecture recordings of classed you missed and boom it summarizes everything for you.\n\nhope this helps you a bit, especially for the folks who don't like reading lol\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[me asking some questions to an econ textbook](https://preview.redd.it/zsr4fh5boyua1.png?width=2166&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7499e67f753e0bac74c0de8e741609a0586e9e3c)",

    "postText": "Hi all! I am moving out of my current apartment and am looking for someone to take over the lease. The apartment is a large studio located on 72nd street and Riverside Drive (UWS).  It is located on the 4th floor of the elevator building with laundry in the building. It is directly across the street from Riverside Park as well as a Citi bike station. It's about a 5-7 minute walk to the subway at 72nd St. and Broadway which is an express spot (1, 2, and 3 trains). There's a Trader Joe's 2 blocks away as well as many restaurants, bars, and bodegas within a 5 minute walk radius. The apartment gets great natural light, especially in the morning and is on a very quiet block, so even with the window open it's relatively quiet (for nyc standards). The rent is $2300/month which includes water and heat. The AC is a normal \"window\" AC unit but it is already installed into the wall and will not require installement. Please message me private for more information! The official Street Easy listing is listed below to contact the broker directly.

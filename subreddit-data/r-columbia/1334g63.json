    "postText": "Hi all, \n\nI am an international sophomore CS major with no internship this summer. I know that I need to chill but as the school year ends, that\u2019s all I can think about and it\u2019s taking a toll on me. I almost finished the CS core (taking AP and Discrete) but still don\u2019t feel confident about my programming skills at all. I plan to do leetcode and projects for the summer, and am still looking for any developer jobs but it\u2019s looking bleak. Do you guys have any advice on this situation or what I should do? Are there any Columbia-specific opportunities that I can take advantage of (on-campus-recruit,....) \n\nThanks all !",

            "comment": "I would say to optimize internship odds make sure your leetcode/technical interview skills are top notch by the end of the summer. Look into TA positions, research, or Columbia Build Labs summer internship. If you don't have a great resume, then most of your interviews are contingent on assessment performance. I got interviews and offers at TikTok, Airbnb, and a few other places after getting everything right on the assessment. I couldn't get past the resume screen for places like Microsoft and Google ;( .  The best thing to do is developing your resume and improving your technical skills but you knew this more or less lol, but looking into summer positions here wouldn't hurt.  If you have really good leetcode skills then you can look into quant dev positions. IMC and DRW interviewed me despite my lackluster resume so I'd check those out as well.",

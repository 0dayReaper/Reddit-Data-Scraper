What is the fashion like in NYC? \n\nSince I\u2019m going to be flying in in August. I need to shop for clothes and I feel it\u2019s better to shop according to what people wear in NYC.",

I would say a nice shirt and long pants or a dress would be a safe choice, but some people are even more casual than that. I guess it might also depend on what you study and what type of classes you have as well?\n\nIf you\u2019re gonna shop for clothes, I suggest buying at least one formal attire just in case (for a special event).",

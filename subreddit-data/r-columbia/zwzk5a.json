            "comment": "Came across this misattributed photo elsewhere and thought I'd share it here since I'd never seen it before.\n\nThis is looking south at the back of Low and Havemeyer.  You can see the dome of Earl Hall on the right side.  I think the man is standing on Pupin Hall which was built in the 1920s, giving a date to the photo.\n\nYou can kinda see how Dodge is going underground there on the bottom left.\n\nIt's foggy, but I don't think Butler exists yet.  Not sure what was there then, just sports fields maybe.\n\nI'm a bored nerd so I gave it a 5 minute colorization... I wonder what color the copper roofs were then tho: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/TEhEO5d)",

Uris was later built on top of university hall, and dodge was built around it when they extended campus level further north, but that's not really what this photo is showing, although the track we have today was (and still is technically) in the center of university hall.",

Like if there's a lot of preserved old facades or anything, guess not haha.\n\nSo a street used to run in front of Pupin?  neat  Wonder if original front doors are down there",

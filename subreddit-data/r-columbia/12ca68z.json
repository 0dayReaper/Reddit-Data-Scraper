I don't get how we spend a huge chunk going through an anatomical/hormone circuits or, completely opposite, we spend a minute top going through the exact same thing. Can't discern what's important and what's not relevant/in the weeds.",

Don't assume the time spent on something in class has any bearing on what the exam will focus on.  \n\nI will say you need to understand those circuits inside and out.\n\nDo the learner's manual questions assigned.  You're fine if you're comfortable with them.",

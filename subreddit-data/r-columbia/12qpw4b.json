    "postText": "Hi, Phys 3081 is super hard to get into unless you are a senior/physics major (I'm neither, but I have to take a physics lab for the applied physics major).\n\nI'd like to get into the Friday lab section but in case I do not, can I take the Thursday section whilst having a class in the middle?\n\nTo specify, the Thursday lab section is from 1:10 to 5 and I have a class from 2:40 to 3:55. Can I leave in the middle and come back?",

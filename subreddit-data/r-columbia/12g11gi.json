    "postText": "Can some current Black students and recent Alumni talk about their experience as Black students at Columbia? Is there a tight Black community? Do/did you feel separated from your peers? What advice do you have for incoming Black students? I know that I want to make a difference on campus and get involved with many different things, will that be received well?",

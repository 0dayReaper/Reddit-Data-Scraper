            "comment": "I haven\u2019t taken these, but based on the description, it seems that 4263 is more geared towards statistical testing and structural models, while 4221 is more signal extraction. In that sense, 4263 will probably be more concerned with confidence intervals and actual statistical tests of hypotheses, like you would see in an academic paper, and 4221 would be more concerned with how accurate a prediction will be.",

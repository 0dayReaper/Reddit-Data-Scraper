Not just for its density -in and of itself a failure- but for the ineptitude of \u2018leadership\u2019. 2 seconds to find videos of Blasio and Cuomo saying Corona isn\u2019t a big deal in the middle of March. Barbot urging everyone to attend parades. Schools being kept open in the face of transmission and the calamity of transmission, the disgusting transit system here, is kept intact. Absolutely, this was and is a NYC problem; with its decrepit infrastructure and ideals.",

It's one thing being wrong and admitting mistakes, but it's another thing denying any possibility of a mistake. This report criticizes not only the authorities but everyone including myself who didn't  take the problem seriously enough at the beginning.",

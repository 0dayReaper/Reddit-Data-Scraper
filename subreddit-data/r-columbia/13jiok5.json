    "postText": "Are YOU or someone you know graduating with a PhD, MD, or JD tomorrow who regrets shelling out hundreds of dollars on their obscenely overpriced doctoral regalia and wants to recoup some of the cost after tomorrow's ceremony is over?\n\nI'm looking to buy one full set, including the tam, hood (any color), and robe for a theater production later this summer. I swung by the bookstore, but unsurprisingly they only had spare undergrad robes, and orders for new doctoral robes closed back in April.\n\nPlease DM with any questions/availability. Thanks!",

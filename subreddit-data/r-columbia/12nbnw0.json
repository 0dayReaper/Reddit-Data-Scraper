    "postText": "\n\nHi, I'm a transfer student coming into Columbia and trying to figure out what major to take / courses this far.\n\nI want to take up public policy after my undergrad, so I'm torn between econ and econ-pol sci; on one hand a double major sounds cool but on the other i would prefer having more freedom with my credits\n\nI'm also wondering how many credits my courseload should be in the first sem? I know I am taking intermediate micro/macro, and maybe literature for core. I should probably take a fourth class, but I don't know for what - maybe UW? Would this be too intensive?\n\nThanks for the help!",

            "comment": "Agree with the other commenter, but also maybe check out urban studies. If you're interested in public policy, poli sci, and econ, urban studies would be a good fit. Very interdisciplinary major 'cause you have to take a variety of social science courses across departments and then you specialize in one. Both poli sci and econ are tracks within",

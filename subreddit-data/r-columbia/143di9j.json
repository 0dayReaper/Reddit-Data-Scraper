Obviously it is a difficult class but a coworker is ranting on how it\u2019ll be the hardest thing ever because it\u2019s Columbia ahahah.\n\n\nAnyway any tips would be appreciated!",

I can't understand why people say that seeing as how Mowsh Bio exists.\n\nPeople argue back and forth if Orgo or Bio is harder, but true intellectuals respond with gen chem lab because I can put organics together no problem, but ask me carry error through like 5 steps and I'm going to give you the wrong answer.",

    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI have been looking at the programs for the MA Climate and Society and the MS Sustainability Management and they both peak my interest. I wish to work in corporate sustainability and was wondering if anyone in either of these programs could give some insight for the experience and whether or not the price tag is worth it. Also, if anyone has any insight on the key differences between the two programs as they are relatively similar, let me know! Thanks",

    "postText": "I would be joining Columbia for Masters this Fall and am looking for housing accommodations near the campus. What options do I have to stay (near the Columbia campus or even maybe somewhere else which has good connectivity to the campus) as an International student?\n\nWhat tips or suggestions would you give to an international student who has never studied at Columbia before and never lived in NYC before?\n\nIf there is another sub that is meant for questions like these, do lmk on that as well.\n\nThank you in advance.",

            "comment": "Hi,\n\nI am an international student. Living in NYC is not only expensive, but it can be confusing for an international student. I had a lot of help from staff at Columbia as well as close friends living in the US.\n\nIf you are looking for housing you can use Columbia housing or off campus housing. For the off campus housing you can check Zillow or my preferred website street-easy. Additionally you can look at OCHA which is a website where listings are managed by Columbia.\n\nYou are a Masters student so depending on the program you are attending you might not need to come to the Morningside campus. However, if your main place is going to be the Morningside campus, then living near it is very convenient. Unfortunately, rent near Morningside can be a bit crazy so most people rent places a bit further away, but still within walking distance or 1-2 subway stops.\n\nHope this helps!!",

But also I find myself more involved in all sort of on campus activities. Maybe I\u2019m just lazy but I probably will skip some department-hosted guest speech if that means a 30 minute subway ride in the morning.",

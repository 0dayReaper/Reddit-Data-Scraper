    "postText": "Hi there! I'm super excited about my upcoming trip to NYC this summer and I'm wondering if anyone might have a room/apartment available for sublease? I'll be in there from May 26th until August 10th, but I'm totally flexible on the dates. If you have a place available but need me to come a little later or leave a bit earlier, that's no problem at all. Feel free to reach out or DM me and we can go from there :)",

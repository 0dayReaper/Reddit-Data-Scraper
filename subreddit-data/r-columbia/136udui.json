    "postText": "Hello all!\n\nHas any CS Major received credit for a summer internship through COMS 3999? It says under the course description it says \"Obtained internship and approval from faculty advisor\" for \"relevant off campus work experience.\" Seems like it can only be done once.\n\nI will finish my degree requirements in the summer sessions but I am also doing a SWE internship. I would like to have the internship count for credit so that my days are a bit more free. Has anyone opted into this fieldwork and can offer advice? Thank you!",

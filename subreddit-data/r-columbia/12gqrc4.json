    "postText": "So I'm an incoming freshman and I'm looking to stay in New York permanently. My family is abusive and Columbia is basically my only way to escape and start living a good (free) life. However, it also seems deathly expensive and not having any financial or familial support is stressing the heck out of me. I know I'll have to work my ass off to even survive with basic necessities. I'm also very, very worried about housing options during summer and how I can afford them. I plan on getting a work study and saving up money but does anyone have any other tips for how I can get a good job and afford living in NYC + summer housing,  when having no familial support?",

            "comment": "Columbia can provide assistance for summer housing in the dorms, depending on what you do in the summer I think - talk to your advisor about summer housing options when you get here. \n\nAs for getting jobs - I\u2019m not sure what major you are. But in certain departments like CS, Math, Econ, etc - you can TA or be a grader. You can do this as early as your second semester in the CS and Math departments. for a part-time campus job it\u2019s decent pay (26+/hr). \n\nIt can be hard to balance studying with working. To help mitigate this there are a few options. Some work study jobs can also allow you some free time to study - for example, working as administrative assistant or at the front desk of a building. \n\nAnother option here is to take up a work study job that also is an extracurricular activity, like working at the Columbia Daily Spectator (the school newspaper). That way you don\u2019t have to work study, do school, and find the time to do extracurriculars. \n\nLast but not least, consider finding a high paying summer internship. This can be stressful and potentially low probability. However, if it\u2019s something you\u2019re interested in I\u2019d look at programs for first year students in banking/consulting/CS (depending on your interests). These applications open right around this time of year. Summer opportunities like this can pay 40-80/hr, sometimes that\u2019s in addition to a housing stipend or company provided housing. This might alleviate a lot of your concerns about affording housing. \n\nFinancial stress can be really tough. There are resources at Columbia for FGLI students - I am not sure if you are FGLI but some of the advice may be applicable in your circumstances. Consider reaching out to the FGLI advisors. Resources like the food pantry here are open to everyone who may need it. Please don\u2019t hesitate to ask for help. \n\nI hope this was helpful. This must be very worrying but Columbia has a community that will try to help as much as possible, and there are lots of opportunities here. Please feel free to DM if you have questions.",

I feel a little better reading this and will definitely explain my circumstances to my advisor as well as search for housing assistance.\n\nI\u2019ll likely major in psychology (and so will probably get the short end of the stick when it comes to the job opportunities). However, I\u2019ll definitely look into TA jobs as well as work-study. Im also low income so I\u2019ll certainly search for resources directed specifically for FGLI students.\n\nThanks again for the advice - it provided so much clarity and I feel slightly better :)",

You can do pysch but maybe also major in say CS so you can get super high paying internships during the summer and also have job opportunities too. \n\nFinancial stability is the first step to your freedom",

However, I think you\u2019re right so I\u2019ll try our some courses this summer. \n\nI\u2019m also attracted to the idea of getting a consulting or finance job, although I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s so insanely competitive.",

However, having a cs background even for those jobs is usually a big plus - otherwise without a good \u201cangle\u201d getting into those big firms is super hard.\n\nCs at Columbia is really fucking hard hit you will get a lot out of it! And it\u2019s actually not as much math as you may think, would recommend trying it out or making it ur concentration if you don\u2019t think you can major in it",

            "comment": "Columbia does have some sort of summer housing assistance, but imo in general if you're living in NYC and paying your own rent you'll need to clear 2k a month in take home pay to not be in a constant state of emergency (i.e. make food and rent for your own room nearby and utilities and not much else so kinda still an emergency tbh, like you're not going to hit the 30 percent rule). You'll need to make around 18+ an hour if you did 40 hours a week. \n\nYou can sort of cheese it if you're not paying rent or food during the school year by saving money during those 8.5 months but I'm just going off of if you had nothing, what would you need in the summer.\n\nI did research internships on campus each summer that were sufficient for paying for my housing and food and a bit extra, wasn't able or that interested in doing a private company internship. During the school year I would TA and tutor (made 5-10k a school year since TA pay was 2500 a unit in the CS department, I think it's gone up since then though), never did workstudy.\n\nWorkstudy will pay you probably 18-25 an hour, the problem is getting enough hours.",

            "comment": "A few decades ago, one of my best summers was reading scripts for a production company in NYC for very little money. Before then I always had to leave NYC to get a paying job while living back home.\nGreek housing on 114th was available and while managed by the university, it had fewer restrictions than the dorms. Somehow 6 of us on various schedules managed to share a double that summer.\n\nPlenty of people stay in nyc over the summer and I'm sure that over the next year you will find like-minded people to get packed into a space like sardines, though housing assistance should be your first stop, as a better post than mine suggests. Also NYC is not a small place and the trains take you anywhere; you don't need to stay in morningside heights, especially depending on where you find work - but please spend your first year getting out into the city and exploring. This will also open your options, something I wish I had done earlier in my college career. Been living here ever since trying to make up for it.",

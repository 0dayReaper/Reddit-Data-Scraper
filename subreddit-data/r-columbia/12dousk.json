I already had a diagnosis, so I just made an intake appointment with the counseling center to get a referral for medication refills, then searched [psychologytoday.com](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us) for a local psychiatrist/NP who would take student insurance. You could also probably ask for a list of external specialists, but I just found one myself because Barnard was taking forever to get back to me &lt;/3",

You *might* have better luck getting Ritalin or Focalin filled, but since so many patients have switched meds during the shortage, that could also prove difficult.",

    "postText": "As title says, my meal swipe balance shown at the John Jay machine is higher than the \"Current Balance\" shown at SSOL. I have some unused swipes from the last semester, so maybe that is the reason? Do they carryover to this semester? I am trying to not waste any swipes. :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate: Okay I just found out that:\n\n* Meals in term-based plans expire at the end of the academic year. This includes Plan A / Term, Plan A /Meals, Plan B / Dining Dollars, Plan B / Flex, Plan C, Plan C Plus, and Plan D.  \n\n   * Unused meals from the Fall Term will rollover to Spring Term. However, these meals will not be viewable in SSOL or available for use until all meal swipes for Spring Term have been used.\n\nSo they do  carry over.",

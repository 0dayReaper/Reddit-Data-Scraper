            "comment": "There are truly only 3* courses that can qualify as being the hardest of the CS core. While this is a bit biased from my perspective these three are generally agreed to be the trickest and each has a different reason for being there:\n\n1. COMS 3157 Advanced Programming \n\n2. COMS 3261 Computer Science Theory\n\n3. CSEE 3827 Fundamentals of Computer Systems \n\n\nI'll start with (1) this is usually the common culprit you hear of when people complain about the core. AP has a lot of content that is of a fairly moderate difficulty but goes really fast for what it's worth. I was completely nervous when I started AP but from my coworkers who had already taken the course they said it's fine if you just don't procrastinate and go to lecture. That ended up being very sound advice. If you start the assignments early and consistently work at them over the allotted period you should at least have something that will get you most of the points. As for the exams, the averages will be low, chances are your grade will be too do not worry this is part of the design this course has a massive curve 19/100 was a C- when I took the course so your grade will be perfectly fine as long as you hug around the averages \nTl;Dr Moderately difficult content very fast pace \n\nMoving on to (2) to me this class had the easiest content to digest both from lecture and just the textbook on its own. I think what trips up a lot of people here is the grading tends to be quite strict and there is very little leeway when it comes to that kind of stuff it also is quite tense when the exams are worth 80% of your grade and homework is a measly 20% you need to definite understand and know the content in 3203 Discrete Math before moving forward otherwise this proof heavy course will swallow you whole due to your minor mistakes. From my experience the midterm had a very high average and the final had a much lower average. The pacing in this course is very much manageable and I would consider it a lighter course if you take it with Prof Chen. \nTl;Dr Lighter Difficulty mostly but strict grading \n\nFinally we have my personal hardest of the list (3) the content for the vast majority of the course is quite different from what you are probably used to. I recommend saving this course for last as having CST and AP behind you will making the content more digestible. You learn about circuits and logic design and that kind of thing, there is a brief period where you learn MIPs assembly and for me missing one lecture doomed me because it really does build on each other until you hit the 'checkpoints' of the semester which allows you time to reset and retry to stay up to date. I personally heavily disliked the content with the exception of learning assembly. Anytime any content comes up that relates back to fundies I usually give out a depressed sigh and just leave \ud83d\ude02\nTl;Dr moderate difficulty, and different set of content \n\nIt is important to note that the professor matters for a lot of these courses, for AP Dr. B has a much easier version of the course, allowing for teammates on the homeworks and cheat sheets for the exams while still providing a good curve. For Fundies it was relatively equal from what I heard so that does not really matter and then for CST I cannot comment as I had not heard of how the other Profs handled it.\n\n*Discrete Math may be considered among this list but really I disagree as here's why: if you take the course with Prof Ansaf you cover less material and the grading is super nice, if you take it with Prof Dear you learn more material with standard grading and you have a more stable foundation for later courses so it pays off so I chose not to include it simply because there is a very noticable easy way out for this course. \n\nI hope this helps! If you have any more questions please ask :)",

No risk of failing, Jae never fails anyone who is genuinely trying and doesn't cheat 2. There are a lot of well qualified TA's who are masters of the material and invested in helping you understand 3. The instructions of the assignments are really well written and the expectations are written out for you very clearly, since the assignments don't change from year to year there's been a lot of time to get it perfect.)",

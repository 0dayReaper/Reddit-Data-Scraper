I did select the part-time option when I applied, but I think it doesn\u2019t really matter based on what I\u2019ve heard at the admitted students day. They mentioned if you don\u2019t have a visa problem, it\u2019s up to you how many credits to take really. I would wait until July or so until you meet with the advisor to sort all of this out though. I see little benefit in hammering the admissions or engineering with emails right now as in my experience their answers have sometimes appeared templated",

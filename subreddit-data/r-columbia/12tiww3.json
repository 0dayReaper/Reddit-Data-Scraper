    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019ve been studying Russian language at my university for two semesters and I wanted to take summer classes in Russian over the summer because I\u2019m from NY and I want to be able to boost my Russian skills. Let me know if you have taken russian at Columbia and if it\u2019s a good program. It\u2019s not enough credits to skip a year in russian and I also want to know if it will be useful. I don\u2019t want to waste my time if it doesn\u2019t seem intensive enough. Thank you!",

You could really try and become fluent here with the support of the professors absolutely. I would take Russian I and work hard on your foundation and vocab memorization because there is a lot of pressure with grammar in Russian II and III if you don\u2019t have the right foundation.",

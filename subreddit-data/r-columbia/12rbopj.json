It IS an Indo-European language, so actually more similar to English in terms of structure than Arabic is. \n\nI honestly think it's a great skill to have since very few people in the US speak it. If you think you have a knack for languages, I'd say go for it... but full disclosure: the sounds the language uses might take some getting used to.",

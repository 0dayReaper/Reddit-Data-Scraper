I am writing my dissertation proposal (due May 3rd) and need help figuring out the stats I will run for the Likert survey I am using. I am not a stats person :) Can you help me figure this out in simple language? I think we would need an hour together, happy to offer venmo, amazon or grub hub gift card in return!",

    "postText": "I recently finished taking Professor Dear's Artificial Intelligence class and this was incredibly challenging. While I'm proud of myself for completing it, I'm still feeling a bit down about my performance.\n\nI mostly struggled with the probability in the course, everything spiraled from there... But I don't want to give up on something I'm passionate about since I think AI will be the future. The math was a shit show for me.\n\nI do have a question for those who have taken this class before - is the curve typically generous? I received a 14 on the midterm and ended up missing three homework assignments, which definitely will impact my final grade. I'm just wondering if there's any chance I might still pass the class, or if I should start looking into retaking it.\n\nAnd more broadly, how do you deal with feelings of self-doubt and imposter syndrome when you're trying to learn something new and challenging? I know I'm not alone in struggling with this material, but it can still feel isolating at times.\n\nI would really appreciate any advice or insights you have to share. Thanks in advance!",

I don't know if the intention is a \"baptism by fire\" sort of thing, or if the they just really want to make sure students have the fundamentals down. But I wouldn't treat doing poorly in this course as an indication you can't do machine learning.",

            "comment": "Can\u2019t speak to the course but can definitely speak to the imposter syndrome.\n\nUsually in life when you make a status shift or are trying something new, the truth is\u2026you are an imposter. (But that\u2019s okay)\n\nIf you\u2019re a beginner, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, but that doesn\u2019t make you a liar or a fraud. You just aren\u2019t assimilated to your new environment yet.\n\nNietzsche said that \u201cevery man is an actor of his own ideal\u201d and that feeds into the imposter syndrome in some sense. If you want to get to the next stage, at some point you will have to act as if you are already there, when you are just barely starting. \n\nAs far as dealing with the feeling, I\u2019d say the first step is understanding what you are feeling and then thinking about the alternative to feeling the way you do. (Since we\u2019ve established that this feeling is very normal when you progress)\n\nIf you removed yourself from what made you feel this way, would that person be the one you want to become?\n\nIf the answer is no, then you know to keep going in spite of how you feel\n\nIf the answer is yes, then you probably don\u2019t care enough to keep suffering. So consider quitting",

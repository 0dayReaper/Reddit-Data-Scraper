And if so, which classes and how difficult was it?\n\nI\u2019m intimidated by the fact that the entire course is done in like a month.Any tips/advice/experience/comments will be helpful. Thank you!!",

Interesting material, but you really ram your way through the topic.  Neuroimmunology had the worst professor I've ever had, I'm not sure that she even understood the material.  So be mindful about who's teaching.\n\nPersonally I like taking language or art over the summer.",

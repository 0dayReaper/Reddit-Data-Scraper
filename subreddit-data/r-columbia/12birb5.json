You will definitely have to take Lit Hum and FroSci--it's required of all Columbia College first-years, and that's what you will be. Lit Hum fulfills a SEAS requirement; FroSci doesn't.",

While there's no getting out of Lit Hum, it's possible to take Art of Engineering over FroSci if you're planning for the transfer and let your advisor know early enough. I believe I filled out [this petition to defer FroSci](https://www.cc-seas.columbia.edu/sites/dsa/files/forms/Updated%20Petition%20to%20Defer%20Reg%20for%20FoS_Mar20%20%281%29.pdf), and then never ended up having to take it after my transfer went through.",

CC no longer permits students to defer FroSci unless there's a conflict with a class that has only one section--something like Accelerated Physics, or an unusual foreign language. You can't defer it because you plan to transfer.",

For example, CS is offered in both CC and SEAS. \n\nI had plenty of friends who swapped schools both ways after freshman year. Personally after graduating from SEAS I do feel the humanities courses on offer in CC are generally stronger and more unique than what is offered in SEAS, and the high class count and low avg credits per class for SEAS degrees will make you work hard relative to your CC counterparts. \n\nThat said if you want to study engineering over a hard science then you can transfer to SEAS.",

You may be able to defer taking frosci, but you should speak to your advisor about this as soon as you can. If you don't get a chance to do it this summer, you'll definitely have a chance during NSOP",

            "comment": "As a non-traditional transfer student it entirely depends on your familiarity with the material before getting to Columbia. The classes (Calc, Gen Chem, &amp; Fundamentals of Neuroscience are the ones I've experienced) and definitely a lot more intense than what my buddies back home are doing in the UC and CSU system. But what else would you expect coming here? You have to realize that by coming here, you're placing yourself amongst some serious career students (parents have professional degrees or are in academia. Or the students themselves come from prep/boarding schools) so you're expected to hang at that level. \n\nTheres a reason a lot of pre-med forums actually recommend NOT going to a T-20 school for pre-med, but they often don't realize a lot of Med Schools recognize the higher rigor of Columbia and its peers. To answer your main question, its definitely possible to achieve that but it will be a lot of work, doube so if you aren't already familiar with STEM. \n\nAs a personal example, I've never taken chemistry, got a D in Biology in high school 7 years ago, flunked out of pre-Calc 6 years ago, then served in the Marine Corps Infantry were there obviously wasn't any STEM outside of some basic algebra for my particular job. So I was WAY behind my Columbia peers. Although I caught up because I've spent a lot of time (to the point I have no real life outside studying) catching up with Khan Academy and Organic Chemistry Tutor. For example, my Gen Chem class didn't teach us about moles, how to read a periodic table, convert units, about the different groups on the P-table, etc because that basic stuff was expected to be common knowledge. \n\nSo yes, it is possible. But understand Columbia is hard. Its supposed to be challenging to a highly motivated and \"well groomed\" student body, so it's definitely going to be hard for everyone else. Although one silver lining is that I find teachers and advisors treat you like an adult (maybe its because I'm an older student, but I've heard similar from my young friends), as in if you're struggling with a class or mental health they will work with you to make sure you complete the class with a respectable grade.",

Would much prefer to live there as opposed to were I actually am (feel free to dm, don't really want to dox myself in public posts).\n\nAs other have stated.  I'd stay away from parks at night, so your walking commute might be a bit longer if you were planning on going through.  But other than that, its a city so be alert anywere.  The crime rate in NYC is generally pretty low compared to other major US cities.  There are a lot of people. So you are bound to hear the horror stories occasionally.  Just stay on your feet, an you will be fine almost anywhere in Manhattan.",

Or Clinton? Anyway, this has the opposite meaning of what you intend. Morningside Heights in particular, and NYC more generally, has gotten safer and safer every year since substantive record-keeping started b being freely shared in 1991, and the 'hood was even more dangerous in many ways throughout the whole of the 80s and much of the 70s. The crime rate of 2022 regressed to the crime rate of 2013, not one of the actually dangerous years. The Columbia I first knew was far, far less safe than the one you did, yet even then that fear-mongering wasn't appropriate. \n\nThe 'hood is safer than most neighborhoods in every city or town in this country. I know it doesn't feel like that. But consider this: the few blocks that encompass Morningside Heights (110th to Tiemann, broadway to riverside / Edit:110th to La Salle, Broadway to Morningside Drive) hold upwards of 40,000 residents, depending on the student population. That's a mid-size city in most of the country. Those cities see more murders and other crimes but not everyone learns the name of the victims and they don't become national news for partisan purposes.",

As you can see from this discussion, people have different points of view on this topic and are ready to harness facts to support those points of view, even when the same facts may lead to different conclusions. But really, if you have the opportunity, you should visit yourself\u2014and at different times of day\u2014just to see what it's like and whether you'd want to live there. I would make the same recommendation for anywhere, really.",

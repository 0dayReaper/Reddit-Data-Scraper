I second the advice on getting a place close to work, but also do your due diligence on the work and overall culture of LA (it\u2019s its own animal and doesn\u2019t compare to any other major city in my experience). \n\nYou could not be moving to a more different environment, and that\u2019s not always for the better. I find that NYC transplants either love or abhor LA; the ones in the latter camp usually leave soon after they realize how much they hate it. I\u2019m somewhere in between. \n\nI\u2019m sure you already know all of the above, but just know what you\u2019re getting into. \n\nGood luck!",

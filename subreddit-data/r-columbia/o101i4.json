This is a childhood friend (Parsons School of Design alum) who has gone missing in New York City and we need more eyes  out for him since the case is moving very slowly with the local authorities. We need you all to help the authorities with locating him in NYC. He was last spotted on Thursday, June 10th in New York wearing a blue t-shirt and black shorts.\n\nPlease help spread the word in your communities/ neighborhood/ any other way you feel you can.\n\nLet's together #FindBhavik\n\nEDIT: HE HAS BEEN FOUND! THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR ALL YOUR HELP!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z6e811e19l571.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38e53efcd21b7b692e4bd40262be9c9a1d46b2e7",

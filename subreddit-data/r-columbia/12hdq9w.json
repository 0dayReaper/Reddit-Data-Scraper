    "postText": "Hey guys! I got admitted to UCLA, USC (with the presidential scholarship-50% tuition waiver), and Columbia-Sciences Po. The Columbia dual degree was my dream program and I would have EDed there given a choice. My main concern going to Sciences Po is that it's very social sciences focused and I won't have as much academic breadth as USC where I can also do a double major from the college of arts and sciences and the Marshall School of Business. Plus I'm the kind of person who gets involved in a lot of activities and clubs and would really love the US campus feel. At Columbia, which is more academically focused, I may not get to explore that fully. I am also worried about going to a country where none of my friends are going. But at the same time, I also really value the international experience that combines the European experience and the American. Plus I get out of college with an Ivy League degree. \n\nI attended the in-person events for UCLA and USC in my city. And I definitely am more keen on USC. The people at USC seemed way friendlier, less nerdy, and more approachable. The social life matters a lot to me and while the duality of Paris+NYC is exciting, I don't fully know what it entails. UCLA seems like a middleground considering that it has a better location than USC+ amazing food+ smarter people+ more brand value in my country. However, I don't feel like my heart is calling me there at all. Does anyone have advice?",

As you said, you won't get the classic U.S. college campus experience at Columbia, and in France it will be even less fun. Living in New York is an amazing experience, and I absolutely LOVE our campus, but I wouldn't have chosen it as an undergrad. Go wherever your heart is calling and you think you will be happy. If that's a sunny campus college in California like USC, then cool!",

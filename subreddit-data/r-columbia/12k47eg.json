    "postText": "Does anyone know of a company that picks up and delivers belongings that won\u2019t cost an arm. I would like to move out of CU housing and go to my summer housing which is 30min away from CU, however all the companies I have called so far are charging in the 1000s. I could do U-Haul, but I do not have a driver\u2019s license and my friends who know how to drive are moving out earlier than me.",

Did you check to make sure they\u2019re only covering the transport from building to building as opposed to personally packing up your stuff?\n\nAnother alternative is to pay a classmate with a license to do it (or buy pizza and drinks)\u2026is there an undergrad classifieds section?",

Shell out for the pricier company.\n\nAre your possessions sturdy and/or not that valuable? Google \u201ccheap movers nyc\u201d\n\nAlso figure out what you can take by yourself via preferred transit method. You could save big by taking a few train trips with a duffel full of kitchenware or whatever and only have 1 or two big items for them to take.",

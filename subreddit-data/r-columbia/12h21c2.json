    "postText": "Hey, so as a recent admit to Columbia hoping to go to med school, I wanted to consider how the Core would affect my GPA.\n\nI've heard stories of how the Core is extremely difficult and forces students to compete against each other. As a rural high school graduate, I am afraid that I would at least initially want a smoother introduction the college environment. \n\nWhile the idea of the Core sounds very interesting to me in that I love exploring disciplines, I don't want it to come at the expense of my hopeful medical future. Will the Core Curriculum hurt my chances for med school?",

Even in more intense sections, I don't think it ever turns into a competition thing. No one is majoring in the Core, you're not competing for honors or something, people generally are really willing to study together and help each other out. And because everyone does the Core, you can study with friends not in your specific class or get advice and old books from upperclassmen. You don't really get it until you're going through it, but it really is more of a collective intellectual experience than an intensive academic trial.",

Your A+ won't especially impress them, nor will your B- put them off. If the Core interests you, don't be intimidated by the need to work hard or the fear of a \"bad grade.\"\n\nIf your STEM courses are challenging, get help early (free tutoring is available in almost the entire premed curriculum--Gen Chem, Calc I, stats, Intro Bio, Orgo, physics--starting in the third week of classes).",

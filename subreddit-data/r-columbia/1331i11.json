I'm a low income student who could put to use many things such as cookware/kitchen stuff, bedding, books, air conditioner, vacuum, chair, maybe some recreational/entertainment items... really anything a student might put to use.  \n\nDM me if you've got things to get rid of any anything I can use I'll gladly take off your hands.  Time permitting, I might even be able to help you take what I can't use to a donation center (the Community Impact food bank on 114th).\n\nThank you for your consideration!",

    "postText": "[Culpa.io](https://www.culpa.io) is a place to review review everything related to Columbia! There were initially some issues with migrating culpa data, but we managed to copy over every course and professor review from culpa.info to get you started. \n\n\n**Why did we remake Culpa?**\n\nNow that the OG Culpa has been down for half the year, and it seems like there are little to no people working on it anymore or checking the email, it's safe to say that the site is dead. Not being able to review classes or see any of the old reviews left a pretty big void, which was partially filled by a couple wonderful website devs here with culpaarchive and culpacache. That said, the ability to anonymously review classes &amp; professors at Columbia has been missing for a long time. Now you can do that with [Culpa.io](https://culpa.io)! \n\n**What's new from the OG site?**\n\nNow you can review everything from [SSOL](https://www.culpa.io/reviews/Cuit-Services/40) (it\u2019s currently sitting at 1 star) to [the bathrooms in butler](https://www.culpa.io/reviews/Bathrooms/53). If you can think of another fun category to add, let us know! \n\n**Why should I use this site?**\n\nIf you are looking for course reviews, culpa.io is now the most accurate archive of everything that was on culpa.info before it went down. We appreciated the efforts from the sites that have tried to preserve the data from culpa.info, but noticed some of the previous archives made use of the wayback machine so they were missing reviews from after 2016. Additionally, given how the OG culpa data was set up, there were many confusing bugs such as reviews for professors with the same name being merged, and 10 different names for LitHum (we counted). In culpa.io, this has all been fixed! Its not perfect, but hopefully it'll keep improving as we keep improving the site and get suggestions from the community (Please let us know if you find some data that's missing from culpa, and what data it is.) \n\nIt is also the first place to anonymously review a lot of other places, resources, and things on campus (like clubs and bathrooms), so hopefully it'll give everyone some useful info about other aspects of Columbia as a whole. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n**A note:**\n\nJust like culpa.info, your reviews are completely anonymous. We don\u2019t even store the IP they were posted from (it honestly wouldn\u2019t make sense, since they all come from Columbia anyway). There is still a manual review process to ensure that offensive / inappropriate content is not posted, but we have a dedicated team to help go through reviews (and will be transparent with frequent updates about the site). \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n**Updates planned:**\n\n    - UI improvements \n\n    - Q&amp;A feature\n\n    - More powerful searching &amp; sorting\n\n    - More mobile friendly\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nWe're open to feedback and suggestions on the site, so please ask whatever questions you might have!\n\nTL;DR: new [culpa](https://www.culpa.io)! review class, but also review bathroom. please tell us the best bathroom on campus!",

Honestly, we appreciate the work the original culpa admins did, but OG culpa data was a bit of a clusterfuck and a pain to scrape. We attempted to comb through everything there and account for everything we could think of, but I don't doubt we missed some things.\n\nAs for the second point, we're planning to stay faithful to the original philosophies of culpa, and we have a similar review screening process to make sure reviews that are slanderous or purely emotional and attacking the professor's character are not posted. We'll also make sure to look at the previously approved culpa posts for guidance on this",

Currently the way I scraped it was only taking into account recent professors who have taught recent classes. I realize now that this was probably a bit short sighted. I will update it with reviews dating farther back. There are also definitely some issues in general that are usually because professors changed names, classes changed names, or culpa.info has 10 different names for the same class. I am trying to add them as fast as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Thank you for the comments!",

The gold/silver nugget system also didn't really make sense (who gave them out? On what criteria?) and didn't seem to be accurate half the time (I've had plenty of friends take classes with a prof because they had a nugget and they were much much worse than their other professors). \n\nI also love how the parts that you actually want to see, the reviews, are emphasized on the class page",

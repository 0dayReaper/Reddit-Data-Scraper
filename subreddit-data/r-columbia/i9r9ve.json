    "postText": "Hi team,\n\nI'm grateful for everyone who's helped us in our efforts to mitigate the coronavirus so far, but I think it's important to reevaluate our circumstances now; I've changed my mind.\n\n**Who can live on campus?**\n\nAlthough NYC is doing well (as expected) with its phased reopening process, the virus is still a threat to campus life. Now, we will only allow CC and SEAS students who must be present on campus due to personal (WiFi, quiet space, etc) or academic (lab work, access to special archives, etc) circumstances to live on campus. Housing arrangements for GS undergrads haven't changed.\n\nWe'll reevaluate in the spring.\n\nThere are two main reasons for this decision:\n\n1. Many of our students come from high-risk areas and would need to self-isolate for two weeks; that isn't realistic, especially for students who are leaving home for the first time.\n2. Our social distancing protocol will also be intense; quality of life won't be all that great on campus.\n\n**Will courses be virtual?**\n\nAs few undergrads will be on campus, all undergrad courses will be virtual.\n\nSome CU grad schools are using hybrid or in-person models while also taking into account students who won't be able to attend in person due to travel restrictions. \\~40% of grad courses will be hybrid or in-person.\n\nLastly, there is every reason to believe the conditions we're experiencing will continue in one way or another for a while. I'm optimistic, but we gotta be flexible. Let's think of this fall as a phased return of undergrads.\n\nCheers,\n\nPrezbo",

Really? Like they're the ones, not professors, who will be getting up and standing in front of dozens of students 2+ times per week, literally risking their lives? They'll be at home.",

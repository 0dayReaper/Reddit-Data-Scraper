Gov.Cuomo from advice from medical professionals have said it is ok and good to get excecise and go on walks. It's also important for mental and physical health. OP is also going to a place that is already more open than the the rest of New York in terms of space. There are less people there now and if they where a mask and mind their space, I don't really see an issue.",

There are plenty of cities that are far more dense but have enough cases that you can count them on your hands e.g.Seoul or Singapore. \n\nThe difference is disease management and control e.g. testing and tracing.  And also on population behavior. Here in NYC, no one really gives a shit about how to minimize exposure. So you get stuff like this post.",

As soon as Cuomo instituted the shelter order the cases saw drastic declines in curve. It simply lagged behind the policy by mean incubation period.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with getting exercise outside. Absolutes do not make compelling arguments, eg \"no one really gives a shit about how to minimize exposure\"",

However, NY has been testing more than just about any state (I'd like to say more than many other countries, but I don't have the data). But pretending density isn't a large part of the issue I think is prematurely dismissive of how packed the subways get in NY and space is not to be really had during commutes in NYC. California had strong efforts but also many people drive and buildings are spread very far apart. As for NYers not behaving correctly, you will find that to be true in every state and every country, the US is not the only place where people have protested or just blatant forgoing of social distancing. People, in general are doing what they are supposed to. If they weren't, we wouldn't see a plateau in hospitalizations and deaths. Obviously, now isn't the time to stop, but if OP wears a mask, stays away from others, and goes to a place like Morningside Heights which has more space than any other place except say Riverside Park in the area, then they would actually be doing the appropriate thing.",

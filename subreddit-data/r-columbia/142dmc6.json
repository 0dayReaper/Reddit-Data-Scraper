            "comment": "Use streeteasy.  Be aware that you'll need to prove you earn 40x rent, google that for alternatives.  Look for no-fee apartments, broker fees are mostly bullshit.  Smaller landlords will be much more flexible, they tend to own the prewar walkups (the skinny 5-6 floor buildings).\n\nKnow what they can or cannot legally charge you for when applying/signing:\n\n* They can only ask for one month's rent total as a security depost.  Some might try to ask for a security depost plus last month rent, which is illegal.\n\n* They can only charge $20 for a credit and background check, and must provide you with a copy before you pay it.  In reality, you'll need to be flexible on that last part.\n\n* They can only charge a $20 application fee (this includes the credit and background check fee).\n\n* They cannot ask for \"key money\" (paying to ensure you get the apartment).\n\n* They cannot take cash, nor advanced/lump sum payments.",

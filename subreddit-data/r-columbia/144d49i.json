            "comment": "First: First-years take LitHum (Full year), FroSci, and UW (FroSci+UW are each one semester, one taken per semester). All first-years take this, you get around it. These courses will compose about half of the first-year curriculum. \n\n\"Easiest\" is a pretty vague metric. If you mean \"easiest\" as actually getting into a course, you're automatically registered for LitHum, FroSci, and UW. Foreign Language and Science classes are easy to get into\u2014there are many course sections for most languages and there are science classes that have large lectures. Art Hum, Music Hum, Global Core, and Physical Education are pretty difficult to register for as most are filled during upperclassmen registration. If you're lucky, you might be able to register for Art Hum/Music Hum in the Spring depending on their registration time, as there are 1-2 slots in each section designed for first years (but usually not filled by them). If you're a prospective Art History or Visual Arts major, you might get preregistered for Art Hum in the fall but that's a pretty low number of students based on your admission file (when you input your intended major). And you are not able to take Contemporary Civilizations as a first year; you'll be automatically registered for that as a second year.\n\nIf you mean course difficulty, it depends on your professor. Amongst my peers, FroSci is seen as busy work while LitHum and UW are more involved but *very* *much* professor dependent. Foreign languages are pretty straightforward assuming you don't take a radically difficult language. Science Classes depend on which course you take and your previous exposure to the material.",

Some languages also offer accelerated versions (a whole year in one semester), check with the departments to see which and when it is offered.\n\nI wouldn't say there is any language that sticks out as \"easier.\"  Instead, if you're only an English speaker then taking a Romance language or, like, German is probably a lot easier than Mandarin, Arabic, Urdu, or Russian. Also, non-western languages like Mandarin, Japanese, Arabic, etc. are usually 5 credits per semester while Western Languages are 4 credits per semester\u2014different workloads.  \n\n\nEDIT: In my haste to post, I forgot an \"or,\" German is not a romance language lmao.",

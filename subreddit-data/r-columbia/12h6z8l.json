Maybe see if the language you're learning holds such hours and visit, then you can ask the professors questions if you end up talking to them.\n\nOther than that, from my experience, language professors at Columbia are quite friendly and probably wouldn't mind you asking them a couple questions even if you're not their student. Try emailing them, you never know until you try",

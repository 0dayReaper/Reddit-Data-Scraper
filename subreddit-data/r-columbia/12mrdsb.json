    "postText": "Just admitted today via Combined Plan (3+2). Throughout my 3 years at a LAC, I took the following CS Core courses:\n\n- Intro CS\n- Data Structures in Java\n- Advanced Programming equivalent\n- Discrete Math\n- Linear Algebra\n- Automata Theory equivalent \n\nI\u2019ve also taken Programming Languages, which I know is an elective for the Software Systems track.\n\nI was wondering what the process for Course Equivalency is like and what the next CS course would be in my progression?\n\nWould all of these get approved for credit and would I basically only take CS electives for my time at Columbia (apart from Systems)?",

So def speak to your advisors and see how the credit would work for those. If you think you have the equivalent classes, you probably have to send your pervious course syllabus to the corresponding personnel in the CS dept to get an exemption approval.",

Since I am effectively done with most of the core, can I use that extra class space to take random other classes that are of interest to me i.e. other electives, grad-level, or even non-CS electives, etc. or are there more restrictions imposed on me?",

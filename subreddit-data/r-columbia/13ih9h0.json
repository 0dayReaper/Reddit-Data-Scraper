    "postText": "I posted looking for tickets and it\u2019s obvious most of the people dm\u2019ing me are not only not graduating but likely not even students trying to scam me. No one will provide proof they are students or have tickets available, but they expect me to send them the money first. You\u2019re not even supposed to sell tickets anyways. Is it a common thing for people to join college subreddits to try to scam people out of money during graduation season?\n\n*Sigh* Anyway, still looking for 2 tickets. Will pay $10 each, but you have to have proof that you have tickets and are a student and not some rando trying to scam me.",

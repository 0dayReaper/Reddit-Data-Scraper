            "comment": "Well, it is hard to say the kind of lifestyle different people have, but Columbia has a 9 month expenditure average.\n\n-Room and board: $22284 or $2476 per month\n\n-Personal expenses: $5400 or $600 per month\n\n-Books and Supplies: $2000 or $222 per month\n\n-Transportation: $1143 or $127 per month\n\nYou can definitely get rent + utilities for much cheaper if you are willing to share an apartment with multiple people or go into campus housing.\n\nPersonal expenses is the biggest variable. But it seems about right for groceries + extracurriculars + hanging with friends.\n\nBooks and supplies is a lot less since most books can be downloaded.\n\nTransportation in NYC has a cap on how much you can spend per week. If you do 12 trips in transit, then everything from them is free. So there is a maximum of $33 per week or $132 per month. But I have never seen anyone spend that much unless they live really far from school. Also include taxis, etc.\n\nIf you have children:\n\n-First child: $4770 or $530 a month\n\n-Each additional child: $4105 or $456\n\nOther than that there is a bunch of university fees. The most important being insurance and the health service fees.\n\nI hope this helps and hopefully it doesn't stop you from coming here.\n\nEdit: Format.",

I get insurance through work though.\n\nYou could get rent down to maybe 800 to 1k a person but it will be a lot of compromises and may not be a nice place unless you go way out to Inwood or get lucky.",

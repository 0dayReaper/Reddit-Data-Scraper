    "postText": "My partner (26M) and I (22M) have been dating for a year. I was recently admitted to a PhD program in GSAS at Columbia, and we're trying to figure out whether we should move together into couples housing or whether I should just move up on my own while we do long-distance. \n\nWe would both prefer to move together, but we worry that if for some reason the relationship doesn't work out, I might lose access to housing. My partner would also lose housing, but this would not affect him as much, since he attends a virtual masters program and could simply move back in with his parents. As for me, I would be \"required to transfer to a unit sized for a single occupant based on availability\" (these are the words of the Residential Coordinator I emailed). I would be happy to move into an additional housing unit within Columbia Residential if I need to, but this comment suggested to me that housing through Columbia Residential is not \"guaranteed\" in the event that I become single (when I asked the coordinator about this, she said that housing is actually not guaranteed to residents at any stage of the residential process. Maybe they just say this in case they need to evict people for a rare situation, like a pandemic?), however it also seems that they would definitely do what they can to help, because when I asked the coordinator about this, she said \"We have policies in place to help navigate common occurrences and do our best to work with our residents to produce the best solution to their issue.\" \n\nI'm trying to make sense of the ambiguous language that is used, and I figured soliciting people for their opinions would help. Do you all think I should trust Columbia Residential not to kick me out of their system if the relationship doesn't work out? Do you think it\u2019s likely that they would kick me out or not? Anyone had any experiences related to transferring out of couples housing or know anyone who has?",

With CU, it is easier to transfer once you are in the system than try to get in at a later date. AFAIK couples/family housing is in higher demand and they would be happy to move you into a shared situation or studio.",

    "postText": "Hello! I got accepted into SEAS, but I am considering switching to CC. I want to study finance, and there's financial engineering at SEAS and financial econ at CC. I've heard that many of the classes are similar (?), but it is the core that differs. I'm also interested in the business concentration, which is further convincing me to try and transfer to CC my sophomore year (which i think is the earliest?). What I wanted to know is what courses I can try to take my freshman year in SEAS that will overlap with the CC courses so that the transfer will be easier and I won't have to make up as much. Please tell me if there is something I'm doing wrong, I'm open to any ideas. If there is any other information I should add, let me know as well. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Both the IEOR majors and Financial Econ majors end up at Goldman-Citadel-Citi-JPMorgan, etc etc anyway. The concentration is not really important. The big difference is the Core. SEAS takes an abridged version of the Core\u2014[listed here](https://www.cc-seas.columbia.edu/csa/seas_nontech). It's about 2/5ths of the whole Core.\n\nSo, if you look at [LitHum](https://www.college.columbia.edu/core/lithum/texts) and [CC](https://www.college.columbia.edu/core/conciv/texts) and think you'd enjoy reading and discussing the ideas contained in a \"Great Books\" curriculum, switch to the College. In retrospect, one of my regrets as a SEAS student was choosing two easy Global Core classes over Contemporary Civilizations. Your education is not just about getting a job.",

Financial Economics is the [full Core Curriculum](http://www.college.columbia.edu/core/classes) (LitHum, CC, ArtHum, Music Hum, UWriting, Frontiers of Science, 2 Global Cores, Foreign Lang) + the courses listed in that major checklist. There are no \"tracks\" (EMS, Analytics, Financial Engineering) like SEAS requires, which gives you the option to pick any concentration in CC (as long as it doesn't overlap/double count classes).\n\nThere's no semester-by-semester chart template, I think that's something only the engineering school does.\n\nTrust me when I say, the difference has very little impact on post-grad opportunities. Both IEOR and Financial Econ end up in the same internships, with the same full-time offers, and in the same roles. Just take what you are interested in and don't stress min-maxing the \"right\" combo of majors and concentrations for IB/quant/MBB.",

AFAIK you have to take it tho so you don\u2019t really get a say.\n\nHere\u2019s what I would do:\n\nFreshman fall: UW/AoE, Chem, Physics, Math, Principles\n\nFreshman spring: UW/AoE, Physics, Micro/Macro, Math (if needed), an intro stats course\n\nTransfer to CC\n\nSophomore Fall: LitHum, FroSci, Micro/Macro, Econometrics, Psych\n\nYou\u2019re now ready to apply for the business concentration. You still need 5 econ electives, 5 business courses, 2 sems of Art/MusicHum, 1 sem of LitHum, 2 sems of CC and up to 4 sems of language but you have 5 semesters to do it.",

I would encourage you to seek unbiased info about what it might enable you to do that you couldn't do otherwise. Note that you have to apply for it as a sophomore or junior (or most likely both--very few sophomores are accepted)--there's no guarantee you will be able to do it. \n\nYou might want to check out the Entrepreneurship minor in SEAS for comparative purposes.",

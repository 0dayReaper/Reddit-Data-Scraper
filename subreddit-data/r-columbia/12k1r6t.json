    "postText": "I\u2019ve been thinking about becoming a TA for a class I\u2019m currently taking, but I\u2019m not entirely sure if I want to. \n\nWould probably look good on med school apps but I\u2019m not really that passionate about it (ie. teaching). I\u2019m not sure why tbh\u2026 it may be because I\u2019m a bit introverted so it\u2019s gonna feel like a chore instead of something that\u2019s fun\n\nIs there a close substitute to being a TA? (I\u2019m already in several clubs, do research, volunteer what not etc.)\n\nPS. I\u2019m not shy or anything like that, but I just don\u2019t really see myself TA\u2019ing \u2026 would rather do something more clinical for my senior year tbh",

Here's why:\n\n1. You're going to dread it if you do not enjoy teaching it. It would suck if you had to show up to office hours every week after a long day of classes to help other students understand concepts of a class you do not like and are not passionate about.\n2. If you are not passionate about teaching, there are other things that take up less of your energy that can \"boost\" your resume and make you more money if that's what you care about. Get a leadership position in a club, do research, do a part-time/internship, shadow, do a personal project, volunteer, network, go to conferences, take more related classes, etc.\n3. You're messing with other people's time and education. There have been multiple times where I'd show up to TA office hours and I could get the vibe that they were just doing it to put it on their resume and/or do it just for the \"easy\" cash (in reality, depending on what class you're TA-ing for, it's not really \"easy\" money). Many times these people were condescending, unenthusiastic, or not well-prepared in explaining the material to me in an understandable way. And let me tell you: it frustrated me so much that they were not willing to help me and it just felt like a waste of time for me when I could have been getting more help from someone else. There have been times I wanted to cry during TA OH because they were not willing to try to be helpful. You don't have to be a nice, sweet, kindergarten-teacher-vibe TA--just be passionate about helping people who are not at the same level of understanding in the subject as you are.",

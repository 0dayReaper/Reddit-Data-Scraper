We had to record 2-4 30-minute cardio exercises per week, but the actual exercise method could be anything as long as you could record your heart rate as proof.\nAt the beginning of the semester it was 2 exercises per week, and then increased gradually to 4.\n\nSome weeks, we had certain goals like trying to keep our heart rate consistent, or adding high intensity intervals, but that was it.",

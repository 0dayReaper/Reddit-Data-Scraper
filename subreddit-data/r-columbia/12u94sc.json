I've taken a few screenwriting classes before and I loved it, but I've always been interested in acting as well... would appreciate any insights.",

Im just starting the film major and plan on going into screenwriting, so I would benefit more from an additional writing class, but if you're not planning on writing professionally, it might be better to try the acting class, especially if youve already done some writing courses, because it would be something new that you might find that you really love. Plus if you're good at it, it would be cool to do some acting imo",

I appreciated the experience both practically - it\u2019s good to practice getting in front of people in a safe space - and because it helped me understand the actors whom I\u2019m designing for.",

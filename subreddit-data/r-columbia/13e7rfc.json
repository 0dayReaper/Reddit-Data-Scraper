    "postText": "I\u2019m coming to CC next year and would love to major in math, but my school only offers IB SL math, which I got a 7 on, and my sophomore year I took the AP calculus BC exam without the class and received a 4. I\u2019ve heard that the Honors Math sequence is pretty strongly recommended for math majors, but I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any way to do it considering I don\u2019t meet the prerequisites? Any advice would be great.",

What most likely happens is that the math department will make you take an extra math class to make up for not having credit for Calc 2, or just take Calc 2. You should already have credit for Calc 1 from your score. Definitely speak with your advisor, they\u2019ll contact you sometime around the end of summer and you can ask them during your first meeting.",

            "comment": "It\u2019s an easy solution to finding housing in NYC which is usually a challenge. Like someone said, there\u2019s no brokers fee and extra charges and utilities are included. Plus you\u2019re living within walking distance to the main campus. \n\nPrice wise I think it\u2019s affordable. I dormed in undergrad here in NYC as well as lived in apartments throughout the last couple of years and the prices aren\u2019t as bad as I\u2019d expect it to be. It\u2019s very comparable to what you\u2019d pay for outside housing. \n\nMy biggest issue however was my roommate! I wish they did a better job at compatibility and matching roommates. My roommate was not very clean and made life harder than it needed to be. While I was able to get a reassignment and was moved to a different apartment, it was the same shit. Folks who are filthy and don\u2019t care about you and your health. \n\nmy problems could\u2019ve been solved by setting rules on day one and addressing issues as it came up, but I was too scared to say anything as I wanted to avoid conflict. \nSo my advise to you is to speak up! Don\u2019t let them make you uncomfortable in an apartment you both pay to be in. \n\nAs I prepare to move out in a few day bcuz I just graduated, I realize that it was the difference in culture and upbringing that was the issue. \n\nOne example is: My roommate hawked and spit continuously throughout the day. While the hawking sounds ripped my ears away, it wasn\u2019t even the worse part. After hawking, he would spit in the kitchen sink! The KITCHEN SINK. There are many more examples but I won\u2019t bore you with them! \n\nAll that said, it\u2019s easy to get an apartment, but you may have to put up with a douchebag. See if you can find other students  you know and request to live together.",

    "postText": "I took principles of econ this spring and I plan to major in econ because I really enjoyed the course. I had it p/d/f and am unsure if I should uncover it. I am 99% certain I got a b+ which would lower my gpa. I know that for principles you are allowed to p/d/f it and still continue with the major so I am just trying to see if there would be any beneficial reason to have a letter grade for this class.",

B+ is not a bad grade, and considering this is the first step towards your degree, and it is an introductory course, there's a good bet that there are a few more B+'s in your future, or \\*clutches pearls and gasps\\* a C or two. Maybe consider pdf'ing those if you're allowed to protect your gpa. Also, what do you mean 99% sure? Can't you see the grade before uncovering it?",

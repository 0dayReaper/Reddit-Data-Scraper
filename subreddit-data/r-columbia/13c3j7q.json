                    "comment": "copied and pasted from the newsletter:   \n\n\nThis spring, CCSC\u2019s Academic Affairs Committee submitted a College (Latin) Honors proposal to the Committee on Instruction. The proposal discusses key issues regarding how Latin Honors are determined, such as a lack of standardization for A+\u2019s and inaccessibility of achieving Honors cutoffs relative to Columbia\u2019s peers in the Ivy League.   \nProposed solutions include increasing the percentage of students graduating with Honors from the current 25% to 35-40%, or switching to static cutoffs like 3.9/3.8/3.7 for Summa Cum Laude, Magna Cum Laude, and Cum Laude respectively. We believe that these changes will bring Columbia in line with its peers and broadly improve the post-graduation outcomes for Columbia College students, and we\u2019re optimistic that the COI will agree. We are requesting that this change is made starting for the Class of 2023.  \nDeveloped with both student and faculty feedback in mind, we\u2019re excited to say the COI is reviewing our proposal this Friday!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nproposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uVjnqq11Za7z6tliJuAOaCGjp7u9BV00gasWLjs9hMY/edit",

(That's assuming that employers actually take Latin honors into consideration--is there any data on that?)",

This is a great cause that will help a lot of students and help alleviate the extreme academic pressure here to some extent (even if it might be by a little). Hope it goes through because it\u2019s definitely needed",

If you're going to some sort of grad school immediately after undergrad, it won't matter because you'd already be accepted or rejected well before graduation. If you take time in between to do a predoc or work somewhere, admissions committees will see the full transcript, but I really have trouble believing that committees take Latin Honors into account in a meaningful way. *Maybe* if we were talking about an obscure school that adcoms aren't familiar with, but this is Columbia. They know the school and should understand what a 3.xx or 4.xx GPA means here, without needing the additional context of Latin Honors. Jobs, I doubt even more are affected by Latin Honors due to the timing of the recruiting cycle.\n\nThe percentile ranking Latin Honors implies isn't really all that helpful either. Your letter writers are asked to rank you relative to your peers and past students they've had. That percentile ranking within your subject is far more revealing than a global ranking of all members of the graduating class across all subjects.\n\nI think the correct argument in favor of the change is that static cutoffs make it a lot more transparent for students who want to get Latin Honors as a *personal* goal, making them less likely to stress over where exactly they land in the distribution and whether or not they're a basis point or two above/below the cutoff. They have a concrete goal to work towards from freshman year and a very easy way to see whether or not they are meeting the goal at any given point.",

You could also argue that they\u2019re doing that now by worrying about which percentile they\u2019re at approximately based off of old cutoffs. At least this way is more transparent. There shouldn\u2019t be a difference in the eyes of employers or grad schools though as long as they know what a certain GPA here means (it\u2019s Columbia, they should)",

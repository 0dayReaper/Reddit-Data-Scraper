            "comment": "I did for several years but beware the bottom lockers. Both of the facilities I used had vermin including mice which ate into a bag of my clothes and destroyed stuff. \n\nWhen I cleaned out mouse droppings were all over the floor of the bin. I also saw evidence of roaches and found a spider inside one of my suitcases. No bedbugs though thank Goddess. \n\nI told them and they just shrugged. Didn't care one bit that I was at that point paying over $100 for the privilege of having my clothes destroyed. \n\nIf you're going to use them make sure everything is in plastic bins that seal up tight otherwise you may have issues with mice and bugs. \n\nOtherwise they're not too bad except they raise the locker rent quite a bit the longer you stay. I started out at like $40. Several years later same bin over $100 a month.\n\nThe higher the bin the lower it is but you have to practically be a monkey to get in and out of your upper bin if you are less than 6 feet tall and I found their ladders a bit hard to use.\n\nLower bins, more vermin, and they are expensive, but way easier to use.",

It's unfortunately a regular thing with me. I have Sjogren's and IBD and things food-wise they just set my stomach off sometimes. \n\nI also have been fighting the idea of gallbladder surgery for a while now. Mine is very touchy and enlarged though oddly not filled with stones. I finally need to get the sucker out I suppose...\n\nIt's just a bad few days. I'll be fine. Just need to rest the digestive system as much as possible for a while because my stomach is just being really pissy about me eating much of anything. \n\nI'm used to it. I've had a touchy digestive system practically since I was born I think, shrug.",

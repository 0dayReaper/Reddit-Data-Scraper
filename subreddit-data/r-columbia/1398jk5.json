    "postText": "I just got accepted by Barnard last week as a rising junior.\n\nMy current school is a big public one so it is sometimes hard for me to make friends... probably also because I am an introverted non-native speaker.\n\nI recently feel concerned that it may be even harder to make friends as a transfer since people have their small groups established already in the past two years.\n\nI know that Barnard is a close-knit community made up of cute girls. Would you happen to have any advice, especially about social life, to help me make friends there? It could be any event, club, todo/don't do, etc. Thank you so much!\n\nEdit: typos",

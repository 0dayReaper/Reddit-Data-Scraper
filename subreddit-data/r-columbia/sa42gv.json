                    "comment": "Since a few people have asked: there are no step-by-step instructions available for this model\u2014unfortunately they'd take a \\*very\\* long time to create. But I'm happy to [share the .io file](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=15XDnC4nGXCo39A4viULG43LphkoiVaMJ&amp;export=download), which can be opened with [Studio](https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page). If you decide to do this build, you'll have to go through the Studio model layer by layer (which is how I did it).\n\nA few notes:\n\n* I didn't really design this with reproducibility in mind, so there are some choices that made sense at the time which will probably seem weird. Hopefully you can improve on the design!\n* I made some modest changes in the actual build that aren't reflected in the Studio model: I (1) redesigned the underpinning of the skylight for stability, (2) added/moved around some small gaps in the interior walls to accommodate the path of the string LED lights, (3) redesigned the back of the Reference Room roof to accommodate several LED battery packs, and (4) added the nanofigs on the sidewalks, etc.\n* I used [this set of 200 plug-in LEDs](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M9FPE8X/) to light the main model. The string enters the building at the [back left corner](https://i.imgur.com/6aIJhMi.jpg) of the first floor, then passes around the perimeter of each floor (excluding the Reference Room on levels 2 &amp; up, which is lit separately). When the string reaches the end of a floor, it passes up the next floor and snakes back in the other direction. You can get a flavor of what that looks like from [this shot](https://i.imgur.com/JFuV17y.jpg). The string is attached to the \"ceiling\" plates of each floor using a combination of spare lego plates and hot glue.\n* Because the roof of the Reference Room detaches from the rest of the model, I lit that section with battery-powered LEDs ([five of these](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M1G1G6L/) did the trick). I had to stash them into the [back of the Reference Room roof](https://i.imgur.com/lIVyHPc.jpg)\u2014definitely improvised on this part of the model.\n* The names are printed on [clear sticker paper](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B089NJPF5Z/), with an extra layer of sticker paper applied on top to prevent the ink from rubbing off. [Here's the file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uiLBcihbYJUFMJKtEZBobeNx42US36WT/view) I used to print them.\n\nGood luck!",

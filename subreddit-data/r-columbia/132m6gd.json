    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming freshman at Columbia college. As the title suggests, i\u2019m a slow reader and the workload of lit hum seems very overwhelming to me. I can\u2019t imagine myself reading over 100 pages of classical texts in only two days, even if I have great interest in studying those works. Additionally, my reading comprehension would suck if I try to skim. I would understand and remember nothing because when I skim, I always become anxious and lose my focus. My brain also feels like it is not working as well as it used to be, especially starting at junior year in high school. In other words, I think my reading speed is going to decrease more. Please help. Any advice for such a slow reader is appreciated.",

You can find pdfs of the readings (most are in public domain but just use library genesis if you can\u2019t find them) and then paste the text into a bionic font converter. Lmk if you need more help with this.",

Then, go into the assigned reading and try and find where those summaries are pulling from. I was able to get the main ideas and concepts from all the books without much problem, despite having almost no time to read. In a pinch, picking a section that looks interesting and closely reading it will usually give you enough to get through class/an essay.",

Phrases from these sites might find their way into your work, and then you seem to be (and, in the strictest sense, would be) plagiarizing, even without any intention to cheat; I've seen it happen.\n\nAfter your last class of the week, look at the syllabus to see what's coming up for the ***entire*** next week, both classes. Divide it up--read some of it every day. Don't spend all weekend on the reading for your first class of the week and then speed through the reading for the second class--plan ahead so that you do some of that reading for the second class on the weekend before. Even on a single day, don't try to plow through a lot of reading in one go--break it up.",

An AI program that allows you to upload PDFs or TXT files and then you can ask questions about it, have it summarize it, have it compare and contrast different viewpoints it talks about in the chapters, etc. It becomes an assistant on the files you upload and can help you figure out the key parts. \n\nSpeechify. Upload the PDF file into here and it\u2019ll read it to you. Very easy if you\u2019re an audio learner. They have a mobile app and also a chrome extension that allows any page you go on online to be read to you. Including google docs. Pretty useful.\n\nDon\u2019t stress too much. There are a ton of tools available that make these types of things easier for you.",

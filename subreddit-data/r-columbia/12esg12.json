Whether it\u2019s for just you or if you are multiple ppl looking for a place to share, I can help you. I\u2019m a sophomore at NYU and also work at Corcoran. I\u2019ve helped a bunch of students already and most prefer it to working with a random broker that tries to squeeze every dollar out of you lol. PM me if you have any questions or want to see some current/future listings.++\n\nI know how annoying the rental process can be for students, I went through it myself almost 2 years ago. I know how to get you into any apartment you choose as this is mostly what I deal with.",

So I had a big tuition saving by taking a lot of grad course during my undergrad when I paid the same tuition regardless, and then transfer those credit to my grad program later (each dept has their own policy of what and how many can you transfer, some dept doesn\u2019t allow any). I carefully planned it out in sophomore year and eventually got my MS for just $9k",

It's New York not a college town.  \n\n&gt; is it more work hard play hard or work work work?\n\nThat's completely up to you, there's no reason that anyone at any school studying anything should have so much work to not have a social life unless you also have like a full time job or something. \n\nBiggest advice: live in Carman if you want to be sure to make friends who go out.",

Especially the part about putting yourself out there.\n\nAll I have to add is, if [a Mechanical Engineering student from Princeton](https://www.tiktok.com/@griffinmaxwellbrooks/video/7204899383836675374) can come to NYC to go clubbing every other weekend, if Yale students can brag about their \"proximity\" to NYC, then Columbia students have no excuse to not take advantage of a $2.75 subway ride (or Uber if that's how you roll) to everything in the city. It's not a state party school, but there is always plenty on and off campus to do.",

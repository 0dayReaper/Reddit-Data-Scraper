    "postText": "During one of my finals a person sitting near me was being quite loud, and because of it I had a hard time focusing on the exam. In hindsight, I should have probably asked my professor if I could sit somewhere else; however I did not do it, which I now regret. Now I'm wondering whether I should let my professor know just in case if my poor performance on the test would cause me to actually fail the course (I was already not doing so great before the exam, and now this). Also, what would be appropriate for me to do in case if I find myself in a similar situation again?",

Since you mentioned your grades were already not so hot before this, reaching out to your professor will at best result in them doing nothing and at worst have them seeing this as a last ditch effort from you to pull your grades up by blaming another student, which may remove any sympathy they would have otherwise had. \n\nNext time, just ask the professor or TA to move seats if it\u2019s that bad.",

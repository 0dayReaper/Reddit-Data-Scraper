    "postText": "I've been accepted to the MS DS program at Columbia and the MS AI program at Northwestern. I'm focused on high paying roles right after grad.\n\n**Recognition for Employers**\n\nColumbia has high employability and repute in NYC. The DS degree, though a cohort of 200 high-grades candidates, seems like a feeder program to a lot of good roles. There's career fairs for the DS folks specifically on top of the school's career fairs. But most people here are entering the market so roles are more Stat-modelling type. \n\nNorthwestern on the other hand is highly selective, has a cohort of 40 experienced candidates. It's a newer program so not much established in NYC at all, some alums are in Cali. Can't find a good pattern to the kind of roles people land but it's usually at a higher level than Columbia. NU's AI does claim to have good industrial connections, and collaborative content on the curriculum but it seldom converts to full-time roles. Career fairs are obviously not as great as they'd be in Manhattan. \n\n\n**Curriculum**\n\n\nBut NU's AI curriculum is GOD-tier. I fell in love with the core and some electives. Really wanna go there just to study my dream subjects and get food for thought for years. It's covering the full breadth of AI, and delves into depth as well covering state of the art. Many cool stuff like \"Artificial Life\" etc. \n\nColumbia's DS core is shitty and more stats-oriented, doesn't have much ML/DL as electives too are limited. A cash-cow analytics degree at best. I've heard it's terse and rigorous - so I'd be doing a lot of hard work on subjects I'd hate. \n\n\nI wish to know how much of a difference there is, in prestige and brand value for NU vs Columbia and if it plays a major role in tech employability.",

    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nMy friend is subletting for the summer from a student in fairholm and it\u2019s a 3 bedroom on the first floor and he says it\u2019s 1500/month for a room. Is he being ripped off/are they taking advantage of him?\n\nI did some [light] research online, but didn\u2019t find out anything concrete or that is to say, concretely helpful, in answering this question. \n\nThanks\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all the help \ud83d\ude42",

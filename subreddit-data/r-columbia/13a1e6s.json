Maybe I'm not understanding your question.\n\nIf you're asking about when starting at community college... I spent a semester with taking college algebra then another with trigonometry and statistics.  It prepared me fine for calc and stats courses here.",

I just jumped right into Calc 1 this semester and am doing fine by having started Khan Academy and the Organic Chemistry Tutor's Calculus playlist two week prior to the class. It gave me a great foundation and allowed me to keep up with everyone.",

I knew I needed Calculus 1 and I knew I was going to not technically place into it so I just signed up anyways and that practice I did weeks before and during this semester has left me in a really good spot. I couldn't/didn't want to pay to take an extra remedial math class that wasn't even going towards my degree so I just signed up. But seriously, go to Khan Academy and enroll into their Calculus course and then got to the Organic Chemistry Tutor on YouTube, click on his channel, and go to his big Calculus 1 playlist. You could seriously learn the whole course just between those two. \n\n1 Blue 3 Brown also has a great short series of a few videos if you're completely new like I was. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/WUvTyaaNkzM\n\nEdit: Oh I released I keep talking about Calc although you never mentioned needing it. Khan Academy and maybe Organic Chemistry Tutor has videos for Stats too as well as other forms of math.",

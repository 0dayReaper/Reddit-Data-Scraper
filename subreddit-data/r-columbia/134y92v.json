    "postText": "Today is International Workers Day, a day to remember the value of having co-workers you can depend on in the struggle for better working conditions. It also marks Michael Hauben\u2019s 50th birthday, a day to celebrate a [Netizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netizen) and the vision for a free, open, and collaborative internet.\n\nThe internet is often thought of as a convenient way to get immediate access to near infinite entertainment and information sources. With it we can download apps, play mobile games, watch movies, and listen to audiobooks all within seconds. The private companies that profit off the internet would have us believe that this convenience of consumption is what makes the internet so powerful, as they research new ways of monetizing our attention without consideration of the mental, emotional, social, and cultural costs of screen addiction.\n\nIn the early 1990\u2019s however the internet was a very different place. The net was government funded and the fight to commercialize was at an early stage. It was text based and much activity was on Usenet which was sort of a bulletin board style email list protocol. There were no likes or upvotes, you couldn\u2019t follow individuals, all you could do was subscribe to different groups and read/reply to posts. \n\nIn a time before the internet was being used by corporations to generate and sell large amounts of user data, Michael Hauben saw that the real technological leap was in the internet\u2019s ability to connect people unlike ever before. Michael recognized a new phenomena of people acting as citizens of the net and coined the term Netizens. (See: [*Netizens: On the History and Impact of Usenet and the Internet*](http://www.columbia.edu/~rh120/) or specifically [Michael\u2019s Intro](http://www.columbia.edu/~rh120/ch106.txt))\n\nThe Netizen vision of the internet may seem far away from the influencer oriented net we have now, but in spite of the commercialization of the net it\u2019s still a place where collaboration and human ingenuity can make a real world impact. Since Michael\u2019s tragic passing in June 2001, Ronda Hauben has[ continued to keep tabs on Netizen activity ](https://youtu.be/KKFQQDWxNgU?t=1052)and over the years academics continue to research the importance of Netizen development. (some current academic works: [Article](https://globalasia.org/v3no3/feature/analog-government-digital-citizens_kyung-bae-min), [Book](http://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-power-of-the-internet-in-china/9780231144209), [Book](https://books.google.com/books/about/Cultural_Netizenship.html?id=mpxpzgEACAAJ))\n\nWhile technologies like ChatGPT are showing impressive advancement in AI, we find that the human mind is far too powerful to replicate. While greater access to technology and educational resources is beneficial to all, Michael saw that the internet was more than an information warehouse and distributor, rather it\u2019s a place to connect the minds of humanity together to make the most powerful and creative problem solving machine in history.\n\nMichael is a Columbia University Alumni (BA 1995 MA 1997) he\u2019s also my cousin although I was very young when he passed. Did anyone here know Michael? If so, I would love to hear other\u2019s memories of him.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/patkt2alq9xa1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f7ef468aad591a6ed2cd6d197b078b5816e9d6f3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tr12faalq9xa1.png?width=1904&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0f32a736780ba1d9c499016fd44e88fd639cb401",

In my archives there are several dozen messages we exchanged, mostly on work-related topics; nothing very consequential.\n\nThat said, I was aware of and respected Michael's commitment to his ideals. I was startled to hear of his death, after my graduation, and it's always nice to see mention of him and/or his mother (the last time before your post was a month ago, in some context I can't remember).",

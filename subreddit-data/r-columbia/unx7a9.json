    "postText": "I\u2019ve seen too many post recently of people asking if everyone here has a negative experience or if the school is miserable, etc etc. I want to offer a counter perspective as someone who is active here and loves the school. \n\nI just want to say that Columbia has been the best experience of my life so far. I grew up mixed race between two almost opposite environments, I\u2019ve never felt like I belong anywhere, I\u2019ve been a victim of racism for both my halves, and I\u2019ve always felt unable to communicate with people for thinking in such unorthodox ways. \n\nI transferred from a pre-dominantly white school where I felt there was a weird mix of hyper PC culture and thinly veiled sort of new-age racism, where you basically get tokenized or percieved as exotic cuz people think it\u2019s \u201ccool\u201d to be friends with someone from a unique background. \n\nAt Columbia I feel absolutely at home among the racial but also thought diversity. At Columbia I\u2019ve found people who appreciate the way I think, who get me, and misfits who like me just love learning and the occasional city escape. Everything about the whole experience including the city is intellectually stimulating and j find myself hearing something fascinating every other day, either from a prof, a friend, or accidentally eaves dropping a conversation at the steps. \n\nThis is not to say the school doesn\u2019t have its problems. I think the administration is awful, the works load for some classes (not mine but like Advanced Program for example) is a form of abuse, it\u2019s dummy expensive, gentrification is disgusting, and they need to treat TAs better. I also had a nightmare of a TA this sem who literally had 0 clue what was going on, if you look at my post history. With that said I do think the criticism is applicable to most schools and the criticism is emboldened here by peoples personal experiences, and peoples relative unhappiness to the people around them that seem to be living a picture-perfect city life. \n\nI think that if you accept the issues of Columbia for what they are and truly focus on the good aspects, you will find an absolutely amazing experiencing that will literally change your life as it has for mine. I love Columbia and how it\u2019s made me feel at home for once in my life. To those of you who have had a bad experience, all I can say is I\u2019m sorry that was the case, but I encourage you not to give up and to make a genuine effort to find ways to feel at home/enjoy yourself.",

I've generally enjoyed my time at Columbia, but it is has by no means been without bumps. I definitely feel like I was pushed academically and intellectually and that my professors expected me to really learn and master topics and skills to do well. That's possibly the greatest gift ever. It's the most rewarding feeling when you put the time and effort in to really learn something complex inside and out.\n\nIf I had to change one thing about Columbia, I'd try to change the hyper-competitive culture that I perceive to exist. It might be a function of the fact that Columbia admits are competitive people to begin with. I think that aspect of the culture made me feel alone sometimes. I have found my people, but I still felt isolated and sometimes pitted against my classmates in pursuit of top grades. I feel strongly that the competitive aspect of the culture hasn't prepared me for my internships or my future job in tech, which require collaboration and teamwork, not hyper-competition. That's the only major qualm I have. Otherwise, 100% worth it.",

I think many students that complain now will graduate to realize Columbia is a very special place, and come to miss the diversity of people with such a high intellectual baseline and work ethic.",

Being in DC, Gtown had lots of political overtones and almost all of the science students were focused on med school since Gtown didn't have an engineering program. \n\nAt SEAS I found engineers to be much more like minded and have similar goals. Worked myself to death in both schools though \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

I have remained close friends with many to this day (which reminds me, I need to reach out to some old friends I miss).    \nIt is disappointing but not surprising that students today face similar issues with the administration as in that time, and frankly I was told of problems in the years before mine by alums then. Maybe that's just The Way at many universities, maybe Columbia is unique in its bureaucratic sadism. It seems to be another grand Columbia tradition, but do not worry - when you depart you will leave that frustration behind, and be left with the experiences and friends that will last a lifetime.",

    "postText": "I'm currently at the end of my sophomore year, and as I reflect back on my time here at Columbia, it's just crazy. On one hand, I think I have grown immensely. I remember during the first semester, I would have crazy mental breakdowns almost every day in my tiny single at John Jay; I really hated being here. Everything was a mess, even my academics. It slightly got better during the fall, and now, while I can say I'm not where I want to be in terms of grades, I can confidently say that I have improved by a ton and I'm on the right path.\n\nHowever, on the other hand, I feel like I've gotten to the point where I'm 'stuck.' I don't know what to do next, what to aim for next, or how to improve further in my junior year in other ways outside my academics. While I made many friends my freshman year, I've come to realize that a lot of them weren't genuine since I've always been alone at my lowest, and my friends from other schools are the ones who've been there for me. But I can't say I'm lonely. I don't know if I'm spending my time at Columbia wisely. What's the best way? I'm trying to figure it out, but I don't know where to go from this point.",

Invite people from your classes to coffee or lunch, form a study group, join clubs, volunteer. Check out an org that is different from what you typically gravitate towards. The best thing about Columbia is the people you meet. Once you meet them, work to stay connected.",

Nothing ventured is a perpetual commitment unless you want it to be, and you never know where you will meet people with whom you develop a connection. Some of those I was closest to in college have lost touch (this is mostly on me). Others grew into real friendships after school, roommates in the real world, and yet others who I only peripherally knew then have become my closest friends now. One thing ive learned in life is that you cant imagine your way into a future, you have to just try things and see what works. By not trying you in fact deprive yourself of the the things you couldn\u2019t imagine. It\u2019s how evolution works, it\u2019s how experimentation works, it\u2019s often how great discoveries are made, and it\u2019s how people live their lives. Now go listen to John Denver\u2019s Poems Prayers, and Promises and get out there.",

            "comment": "I think there's this popular sentiment that one needs to find friends in the place that they are. I disagree with that sentiment, and I think it is not a true need for most people. I would suggest that it's ok if you don't make many friends here, and if friends at other schools are more supportive, continue to strengthen those relationships. It's easier to maintain than to build, especially at a school like Columbia where people are often some combination of very busy and very self-interested. Not making many/strong/genuine relationships at Columbia is not necessarily a sign that you're not using your time here wisely. Finding and sticking with the people who are supportive of you is ultimately the wisest thing you can do with your time.",

A lot of relationship I have with people at columbia are CLEARLY because they are in some way or form instrumental to the other person. Very few real friends indeed.",

You are likely to meet a lot of incredible people there. Go to Coffee chats, go to small workshops, events ( even making  Halloween pumpkin events), and conferences aligned with your goals. This is the best time to make friends and important professional connections. And time rushes, so don\u00b4t waste your time overthinking about negative things.",

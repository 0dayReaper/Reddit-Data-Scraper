    "postText": "28% of people meet their spouse in college per  [https://www.dailydot.com/irl/facebook-data-odds-soulmate-college/](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/facebook-data-odds-soulmate-college/) . Assume that your exposure to the sex of your attraction is linear (ie that you meet the same amount of potential spouses in your 6th semester vs 1st) and that your exposure with online classes is 0 (both rough but fair assumptions). Thus, you have decreased your odds of finding a spouse at Columbia by 12.5% (assuming 8 semester standard) and 3.5% in the grand scheme of life.",

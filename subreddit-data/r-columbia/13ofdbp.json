    "postText": "Hi! I got accepted as a sophomore transfer student to Columbia college. I'm filling out my housing request form and was wondering which dorms I should stay away from or have as my first pick. I prefer to have a single, but also opportunities to make friends and be a part of a community. I'd also like to be on campus and feel like I'm living at Columbia rather than somewhere off campus. Any suggestions?",

            "comment": "usually transfers get placed in Carlton arms, it\u2019s suite style and people are usually very social. Students don\u2019t prefer it because of the distance (6 blocks to campus) but the place grows on you since it\u2019s very close to grocers n restaurants. \n\nThat said, I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s available for you. What dorms are you looking at?",

    "postText": "I was looking through past websites and offerings within last 1-2 years, and I found many RL courses. I can't decide since some syllabi are not visible, and I do not know how good the proffs are. Most of these don't seem to have much Deep RL and SOTA content apart from 1 or 2 lectures.   \n\n\nI already have Deep RL research experience and work experience, should I rather contact professors for RAships instead of doing these introductory courses? \n\nI know Shuran Song has her Robotics lab that's active in RL, but I see mostly CS and Robotics PhDs in her lab. I'm an incoming MS Data Science candidate - which proffs accept DS (non-CS) grads readily?  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zqb9pr9rn41b1.png?width=958&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=505cf50e0bbc34cad7a0544465926633be3d8db6",

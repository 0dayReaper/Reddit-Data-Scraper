    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am a first year GS student. In my first year, I did not get on campus housing, and ended up living off-campus (we needed couple housing). This year I again applied, the first day that applications opened. I checked with Columbia residential and they told me they accept applications on a rolling bases, and if I don\u2019t hear back from them, it means I will get placed on the waitlist.\n\nMy partner and I are really struggling with paying rent off campus, since due to my disability, I need to be close to campus, and the rent is crazy here. I might be eligible for housing through disability services, but I am not sure if that would work, and which one I should focus on more? GS housing or DS housing. \n\nI am really looking for a way to move out of our current apartment as soon as possible, and don\u2019t know if there is any way to communicate that with Columbia. Any advice?",

            "comment": "Columbia housing is pretty notorious for not communicating well, and generally being inflexible. \n\nThat being said, you should continue to fully pursue both DS and GS housing. \n\nMy best advice is try to make a face-face appointment with someone at ODS and maybe housing as well, because 1. They will understand policy and your options far better than you even if you research for hours, and 2. They\u2019re less likely to ignore and forget you if they have a face to the name. Make sure that you are friendly and charming in the meeting so you are someone they feel like helping.",

In my understanding, they will likely assign you an apartment so you will be able to avoid the waitlist/rolling acceptance process. Def recommend especially given after one is accepted from the regular rolling acceptances there is still some overly hectic first-come first-serve apartment selection process.",

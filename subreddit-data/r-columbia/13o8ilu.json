Like, as Columbia students, are you guys able to register for a class at SIPA with Clinton designated as the professor?",

The class is co-taught by Hillary Clinton and SIPA Dean Keren Yarhi-Milo (\u201903GS) and is called \u201cinside the situation room.\u201d\n\nThe course is open to both SIPA students and Columbia College, GS, and Barnard undergraduates, by competitive application only. The undergrads who are in the 5 year BA/MA program with SIPA get priority.\n\nMore information can be found here:\nhttps://www.sipa.columbia.edu/situationroom",

No. Prudent? Yes. How should students feel about the situation? Grateful that their tuition isn't even higher than it already is.",

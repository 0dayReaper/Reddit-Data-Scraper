            "comment": "Throughout my time on campus, I always saw the shuttles, but it was always a mystery to figure out how they worked. It really doesn't help that the Columbia transportation website doesn't have a consolidated map of them either. So, I spent some time trying to figure out the routes (which were very badly explained and sort of contradictory in some instances). One thing I will mention is that the intercampus shuttle routes are split into 3 different colors (red, green, and blue) but from what I can tell, there's no real difference between all of them. They all serve the same stops, just in really weird service patterns. When in doubt, check the timetables. If anyone tries this out, let me know how well it works! My guess is that the shuttles probably don't even follow their scheduled routes, but hopefully this is still helpful!",

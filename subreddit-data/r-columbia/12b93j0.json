    "postText": "Hey!\n\nI know this is a weird question .\n\nHowever, as a CS Major, I\u2019ve often had a hard time understanding why some would decide to join IB/Consulting where they work gruesome hours and don\u2019t get paid as much as Tech New Grad. I\u2019ve heard that pay Compensation increased exponentially compared to tech. However, I\u2019ve not had enough evidence to back this up as I\u2019ve met several people from low income backgrounds who\u2019ve been able to retire by 30 or 35 and all of them worked in tech (none founded their own companies, some were lucky to work in some pre IPO startups and were able to get great stock options).\n\nHowever, I\u2019ve often wondered why one would decide to join finance/management consulting when there\u2019s the tech industry that has roles like PM, Product Designers etc other than SWE which don\u2019t have coding assessments as part of their interviewing process \n\nI understand that now the stability of the tech industry might be at question amidst all the layoffs. I\u2019d also like to add that there has been layoffs at some finance/management consulting companies like Goldman Sachs and McKinsey \n\n\nTLDR:\n\nSo in short, for those who have decided to pursue a career in finance/management consulting/PE(as a bonus); please share why. Would greatly appreciate it\n\nI hope my inquiry doesn\u2019t come off in the wrong way. I\u2019m just trying to understand all this. Thank you.",

            "comment": "Hey there -   \nI am an alum who has worked in finance and consulting so here are some of my thoughts. \n\nThe exuberance in tech that was present when I was student has decreased as higher interest rates and more competition have set in, from what I can see. There are layoffs but in many of the large firms who are issuing those layoffs still have far more people employed compared to the peak of the pre-Covid levels. Over-hiring amidst bloated stock prices isn't a new phenomenon. \n\nSo why work in finance or consulting? Here are some reasons. \n\n1. It's a great way to earn money if you're not sure what to do after college. Skills are transferable to other industries and these industries tend to pay better for entry-level jobs than most others. \n2. The training is great. At IB or consulting places, you train as a class and a lot of the things you cover can give you  leg up in business school and increase your market value as a candidate for other industries. Not only \"hard\" skills like excel, ppt etc but also soft skills like leadership, teamwork, communication (underrated). \n3. The connections you make are also great. Whether its colleagues, clients or just other people in the industry - the longer you stay, the deeper your network becomes which can lead to other career opportunities or otherwise. Also, the fact that these firms tend to hire out of college and train you also makes the first few years feel more collegial. \n4. It's really competitive. I'm saying this as a pro because there's a certain feeling you get knowing that you're operating and learning at a world-class level. \n5. You learn a lot about how to value, run, and optimize a company. Think of it like the core curriculum but for business and companies. Staying in finance or consulting gives you the toolkit to form your own ideas on what makes a good company, how it can improve etc. If that's what you're interested in, aside from starting your own business, this is a great learning opportunity. \n\nSome downsides: \n\n1. Work is real tough. You're going to to spend a lot of hours staring at screens and crunching numbers when your 20s / 30s are probably where you can have a lot of fun. There is burnout concerns. \n2. Turnover is high. Whether its switching teams, firms, or exiting the industry as a whole, its easy to make superficial connections since everything feels transient. \n3. You're working for someone else's dream. Sounds like a cliche but it does feel strange advising folks on how to make their dreams come true when you can spend the time on yourself. \n\nHope that helps.",

Finance is very hierarchical. And everyone wants to be at the top or they really respect the people at the top. I worked closed to finance and I am so glad I left. I went into tech. A tech person is generally more laid back.",

            "comment": "Most people don\u2019t do banking/consulting for the pay straight out of college but the long-term career development. Going into software engineering, there\u2019s a good chance that 20 years down the line you\u2019re still a software engineer versus very few people who do consulting/banking will still be in that role. And those who do can be making very, very serious money. Consulting is basically a shortcut to more senior corporate roles (re: how McKinsey killed the middle class). Banking opens up doors to PE/VC/Growth/corp dev and more. Even the Analyst years can be a really cool experience - you get to work with the C Suite of massive companies in some cases very closely and get to be privy to how WSJ headlining decisions are made. Sure, there\u2019s some mundane XLS/PPT bs you have to do, but software engineering isn\u2019t all glory either and no software engineers I know are going to Michelin star dinners with the CEO of multibillion companies at the age of 22. That being said, obviously software engineering is a great career too, but it appeals to different people with different strengths and interests than than banking/consulting",

On the other hand, if you start as a software engineer you\u2019ll probably stay as one.\n\nEdited because I realized you mentioned the layoffs yourself",

There is also technical product manager, technical program manager, or technical project manager. Each one of these areas has it's own intricacies.\n\nThen there is cybersecurity, cloud, sales engineering, DevOps, quality assurance, developer advocacy, community management, and data engineering. Each of these have a lot of paths. Web3 is a another beast that you can get into that pays well (I worked as a developer advocate for a blockchain company).",

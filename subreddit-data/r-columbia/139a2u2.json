    "postText": "A friend of mine is looking for doctoral graduation attire (the gown, hat, hood) from the 14th-17th this coming week as the bookstore seems to have run out. If you bought these for a past graduation he'd be happy if you could loan him yours, but he's also willing to pay to rent it from you (say at bookstore rates).\n\nHe's 5'11\", but he would be interested as long as the sizes are not too different. Please send a message to discuss more if you have attire and are willing to loan/rent it. Pickup around Morningside is preferred but he would be willing to come elsewhere to pick it up from you. Thanks!",

            "comment": "If you have the standard Stewart calculus book, read the sections on multiple integration in rectangular coordinates (not vector calculus or multiple integration in other coordinate systems). The only hard part for a stat class is when you have to write the bounds for a double+ integral yourself. Visualizing what those bounds should be and how/if they should depend on other variables is non-trivial if you haven\u2019t seen it before. The integration itself is simple.",

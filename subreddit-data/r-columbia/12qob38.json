    "postText": "Hello, \n\nMy daughter is admitted to Columbia College and she is interested in transferring to GS. The admissions folks at GS told us to write an email to the CC to write a recommendation to GS about the transfer. And when I called the CC folks, they told me to fill out the transfer form which is only available to students. When I told them the predicament, the one on the phone said she can't send it and I just have to download it. Looks like circular logic so anyway I figured there isn't much to fight about it.\n\nCan someone do me a favor and download and make it available (google drive, dropbox)? If the file captures any of your personal info, please **don't do it**. My understanding is that it is a blank form that needs to be filled out.

I think the folks at GS are trying to cut down on beuracracy and get my daughter straight into the GS. At least that's what it seemed like. \n\nIf the transfer is contingent, my daughter may consider UCLA (or may be not), but I wanted the clarity and certainty upfront and if GS is willing to do it, and all it takes is filling out a form for CC, I figured I would do it.",

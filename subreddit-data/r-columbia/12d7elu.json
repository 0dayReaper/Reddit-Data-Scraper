    "postText": "im hoping to double major in math and philosophy and im considering taking the honors math sequence as a sophomore. im currently taking calc i(and doing well) and will be taking calc ii over the summer. im also taking symbolic logic this semester so i do have some ideas regarding mathematical logic. would this be sufficient to start the honors math sequence in sophomore year or should i take calc iii, calc iv and linear algebra? im interested in pure mathematics and mathematical logic. since the honors sequence is more proof-oriented i thought maybe i should give it a shot. would my background be sufficient?\n\nalso, how is the course structured? do i get to take classes with lin alg pre-reqs after the first semester or do i have to wait until junior year? \n\nthank you for your answers!",

I've been able to do relatively well with no background, but it quite literally takes me more hours per week than my 4 other classes combined &lt;/3 \n\nI'd say the hardest part for me has been building general mathematical maturity, rather than catching up on skills (it's a proof-based class, so we don't do many computations anyway). If you want to prepare, practicing reading/writing proofs in addition to the symbolic logic stuff will probably be most productive.\n\nSomehow the class is popular among dual math/humanities people, so I'd definitely recommend it given your interests!",

            "comment": "You should be fine to take it\u2014many students come in with just calc I/II knowledge, and any proof experience from symbolic logic will be a plus (although arguments in honors math will likely be much less pedantic). And it\u2019s absolutely worth giving a shot if you\u2019re interested in doing proof-based mathematics, since you\u2019ll learn much more relevant skills than in calc iii/iv and multi. \n\nRight now, the course is structured so that the first semester covers linear algebra, and the second covers multivariable calculus. However, the current professor is leaving, so it\u2019s possible it\u2019ll go back to the old structure of first semester proof-based calc and second semester linear algebra/multi (you may have more luck reaching out to Dragomir, who\u2019s teaching it next semester, and seeing how he plans to structure it). Which classes with a linear algebra prereq do you have in mind, though? Math department prereqs are often very flexible.",

When the time comes, you can always just reach out to the profs and ask directly. \n\nI might also encourage you to be a little more ambitious with math and try to jump into algebra/analysis concurrently with honors B (depending on your comfort level with proof-based math at that point, of course). Much of the most interesting content in pure math is locked behind those sequences, so your options will increase considerably after taking those. And if you\u2019re interested in logic/set theory, you\u2019ll get a lot of intuition about proof writing/working with quantifiers/infinite sets from these classes, even if the objects of interest are technically different.",

Though it varies a lot year to year, the multivariable calc portion of Honors has recently overlapped a lot with analysis 1, but not very predictably and with some key concept gaps. Imo better to take Honors first and have a chiller analysis 1 semester.",

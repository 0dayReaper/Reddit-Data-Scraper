Global Core, I heard, has about a 20% ish credit transfer approval rate. Art Hum and Music Hum are also required and rarely get exempted. You can get placed out of Lang requirement tho (The above is for Columbia College).",

My ASL credit (foreign language) didn't mean anything to Columbia (they dont even offer ASL) and I only got out of 1 semester of LitHum so just had to take one. Didn't get any Global Core covered but got a lot of the other things covered like science and math CC requirements.",

            "comment": "It partly depends on whether or not you are exempt from the foreign language requirement and/or have courses at your previous institution that could count toward the science and Global Core requirements. The classes that satisfy Core requirements may also double-count toward your major, depending on what that is.\n\n**The Core Curriculum**\n\nUniversity Writing--nearly all transfers are exempted from this on the basis of writing samples from their previous coursework.\n\n2 semesters Lit Hum--very, *very* rarely, someone from, say, U of Chicago is exempted from one or both semesters of Lit Hum; 99.9% of transfers must take it.\n\n2 semesters CC--ditto.\n\nArt Hum--you will definitely take this class; no one is ever exempt\n\nMusic Hum--there is an exam given during orientation or early in the fall for students who are well acquainted with classical music. You may take this exam ***in your first year at Columbia***; if you pass it, you are exempt from Music Hum. Otherwise, you must take the class.\n\n3 classes that count toward the science requirement--you can petition for up to 2 classes from your previous institution to count; **you must take at least one at Columbia.** One of the 3 must be a \"natural science\"; the other two can be math, stats, computer science, or symbolic logic. Transfers do not need to take Frontiers of Science.\n\n2 Global Cores--you can petition for 2 courses on non-Western cultures from your previous institution to count toward this, but it's a real crapshoot; the requirements for something to count as Global Core are quite specific.\n\nAt least intermediate proficiency in a language other than English--if you have never studied a foreign language, this is almost always four semesters, though a couple of languages have intensive courses that allow you to complete it in two. There are various ways to be exempt--AP or SAT II scores, proficiency exams, attending a high school where the language of instruction was not English. If you've studied a language before, you can take a placement exam that might indicate you need one, two, or three semesters rather than four.\n\n2 PE classes--I believe you can get credit for one of these, though only if your previous institution actually granted credit toward graduation for it.\n\nSo you're almost certain to need, at minimum, 2 semesters Lit Hum, 2 of CC, Art and Music Hum, at least one science course (possibly as many as three), and one or two PEs. It's quite likely you will also need either one or two Global Core courses.",

    "postText": "Are there any current Sustainability Management MS students on this sub that would be willing to share their experiences with the program? I have a few general questions. \n\n- Are the class sizes small? How popular is the degree program compared to others?\n- Do you tend to study with peers or is the program more oriented towards independent studies?\n- How diverse is the program?",

It\u2019s a cash cow for the school and has high enrollment.  \n\n- more inclined towards group work than independent study.  \n\n- program is very broad with flexibility to pick courses that allows you to specialize in any of - agriculture, fashion, finance, data, economics, water, etc. Course curriculum requirements also force breadth of knowledge. I do wish there was more depth in the program through advanced courses.",

It is definitely expensive and when you end up with a bad faculty you feel the money being wasted. But there are many good classes as well. I guess it depends on how smartly you pick your courses as a function of faculty and your career needs. DM me with your background and goals and I can perhaps guide you more specifically.",

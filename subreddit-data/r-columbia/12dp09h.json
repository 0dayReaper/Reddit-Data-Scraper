I would also recommend taking intro to EE (or something similar) before fundies so all the circuit design elements will be a lot easier.",

It\u2019s a reasonable workload and you learn all the basic circuit components that you should know going into fundies (flip flops, clocked circuits, logic gates, etc.). For learning about memory(stack, heap, etc.) Jae teaches what you need in AP",

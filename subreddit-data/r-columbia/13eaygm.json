    "postText": "Hello to all of my fellow seniors out there. I am in the midst of an existential crisis right now as all of my finals are complete and I am officially done with school. Wow. Just wow. I can't believe I am actually done with the longest chapter of my life.\n\nDespite all the celebrations going around, I can't help but feel a little lost. I know this is a common feeling. It is like you have been running a marathon for your entire life and all of a sudden, you have reached the finish line. Obviously, I believe everything will work out in the end, and I will find a new purpose very soon. But I can't help but wonder -- what kind of existential crisis are y'all getting? Or do y'all not feel this kind of feeling?\n\nP.s. congrats to all the seniors out there!",

Maybe reach out to friendships you didn't have the bandwidth to maintain and see if they'd like to grab lunch.  Then setting some clear goals to work toward will help you feel less lost.\n\nWelp, our time is up, that'll be $100.",

I don't know if this is your situation as well but because my sophomore year was remote it's like I lost a year of college, so I feel like a graduating junior.\n\nFor me I also feel like my existential crisis is that so much of my identity is wrapped up in being a student, so without that I feel kinda disoriented. Since I'm working after graduation I'm afraid of not being able to remain academically engaged and growing and learning which sounds really lame but it's become so important to me during my time here.\n\nBut yeah, a lot of feels for me at the moment too \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

I'm a grad student, and I found out that the degree I had gone into debt for wasn't remotely what I wanted to do in life. Just remember that because we may put on a happy face for the festivities, that doesn't mean that we are cheerful on the inside. I am working to discover what I want in life because I had one vision for how grad school would play out, but it didn't end up materializing.",

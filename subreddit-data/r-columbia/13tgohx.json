            "comment": "It is basically all memorization. The exams were multiple choice. I would suggest reading or at least skimming the textbook sections before the lectures. Watch YouTube videos on the section if you need a simpler/briefer breakdown of the content. Honestly I never went to lecture and learned the content 2-5 days before each exam (there were 3 + the final) and did well. \n\nRecitation attendance is required but isn\u2019t a review of lecture content. You\u2019re given a research paper each week (which you don\u2019t really have to read, but it\u2019s a lot better if you at least skim), and you work in groups to understand and explain the figures in the papers. \n\nIt\u2019s not hard if you\u2019ve taken neuro and/or bio courses already. If you haven\u2019t, you\u2019ll need to put in a little more work, but you\u2019ll be fine.",

Although Prof Kelley's (neurobio 2) exams were written by TA's and you could tell, fair amount of mistakes on them.\n\nNo you don't need to know physics, there's only one exam in neurobio 1 that requires math and it's just memorizing a formula and knowing algebra.\n\nI'll be honest, I was incredibly disappointed with the whole year of neurobio after Firestein's section of Neurobio 1.",

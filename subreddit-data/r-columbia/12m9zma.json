    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nDoes anyone here do MA in Biomedical Informatics from Columbia?\n\nHow's the program compared to Harvard Master Biomedical Informatics and Stanford Master Biomedical Informatics?\n\nIs it a good program for biomedical informatics especially if I want to do a Phd? I know some people will say to just go directly for a Ph.D. since it's funded, but I feel it's much more competitive to get a Phd position. I actually was rejected for a Phd and offered a master instead.\n\nDoes it worth the price tag? I may need to take a loan to attend.",

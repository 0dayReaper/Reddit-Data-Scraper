Like I was fortunate to have already had some stats background so the class was not too difficult for me, but for someone that's never taken stats before it might be hard. He's not the best at explaining things and had to go over some things multiple times. The ta was more helpful usually. Id still say that while he's not great at explaining concepts at times, it's still a fairly easy class",

I'm not a math person by any means so I did a lot of extra credit work and I did fine. His ta's were honestly useless in my class: basically unavailable, short tempered, and graded arbitrarily, so if you have good ta's the class should be chill.\n\nI did try sending him the spiders georg meme and he did not laugh, but agreed to show his grandchildren. Overall 9/10",

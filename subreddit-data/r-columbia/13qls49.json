    "postText": "I will try to make this review as organized and informational as possible but will be my opinion at the end of the day. Each section will be ranked in order of importance.\n\n**Content and Learning:** Both classes offer problem-solving skills that can be applied to competitions and interviews. Learning is minimal. The material is presented too fast and examples skimmed over. Abandon all hope if you do not know c++ as all material is presented in that language. The best way to learn is on your own time and to practice problems. However, Professor Lim does a good job of packing every weekend with 5-10 hour-long contests. Some are decent like the Leetcode Saturday ones but ICPC contests are way too time-consuming and 50% of the class will probably only need 1/2 hours before they run out of solvable problems. Add this with the fact that you will most likely be doing it in-person the coming semesters and you are looking at the most time-consuming classes ever offered.\n\n**Grading:** This is the most made-up and panic-inducing part of this class. Let's just say the easiest way to get points is by showing up and participating in a contest. You don't have to solve more than one problem so it will be a very gamey class to get good grades per contest but have to stay the entire contest duration. This is why I felt I was learning less than when I was practicing on my own time as your time is mostly spent gaming the system.\n\nNow I don't know if competitive programming this semester in particular was messier than previous iterations but here is everything that went wrong:\n\n\\- Did not know our grades till 10 weeks in as the websites that auto-track submissions was \"being worked on\"\n\n\\- If you missed a regional contest for NY you had to drop the class (unless you were an international student and will probably just get a poor grade)\n\n\\- 5% was assignment points but there were no assignments and at the last minute we were told what this actually counted for \"daily problems\" that no one knew if we had to do or not. Duplicate problems (repeated solution) were also removed from counting until people got mad as the teaching staff did this without telling us\n\n\\- Threats at the end of some random lecture that no one saw till too late about academic honesty and if you violated it you should come forward. Think Jae-style paranoia in AP\n\n\\- At the end, we were then told to properly cite hundreds of problems with a source on where you took the code from if you did \"upsolve\"\u00a0or edit it once looking at the solution otherwise risk your honor code standing\n\nHe is increasingly strict on this as the semesters progress. However, if you grind and put in your time you will get an A+. Just depends on how much you want to cheese that grade and can make it through the grading scheme constantly shifting.\n\n**Opportunities and Job Prospects:** This is probably the one section I can comment on the least but will fill in with my background. I personally got no referrals from professor's industry connections he would subtly brag about. He would promise pizza sponsored by Two Sigma (every time) and pardon my French but that was a \\*\\*\\*\\*ing lie. You will be hungry every 5-hour in-person contest. Industry talks and networking events also seem like they happen once in a blue moon. Did not get any referrals form those or connections.\n\nNow the job prospects are misleading. He will say you need to be a certain level say solve one easy leetcode and two medium in an hour for FAANG jobs. For HFT/Quant you need to be codeforces 1900+. However, I got a quant job without being that good. Sure I worked hard and there was also luck but his understanding of the job market and trends is shaky at best.\n\n**Personal vibe:** This was the most heartbreaking part. When I heard a professor was offering a useful course and cared about students I jumped at the chance. He does care but take that with caution. If you show up to lecture and he knows you, you will be called upon. If you give a wrong answer he will brush you off harshly and look for a better one. He also quit his industry job and made a startup. Not quite sure what it does but I imagine it's closely related. A rate my professor post summed it up well but he uses this class as a \"resume builder\". He will give you bonus points to rate him on rate my professor. Which obviously gives him better ratings. He will use good grades to justify the little learning you get and then say grades don't matter but do fill out this survey for more points. Ultimately this may just be a feeder for his startup.\n\nOverall/tldr: In the end of the day this class is just a means to an end for the professor and you will learn minimally. But hey I do love an A+ so take this if you want but just be willing to spend weekends numbing your mind for it.\n\nLastly, will not be replying to comments cause idc in the end of the day. I did what I had to do it's just regret and something I would not have known if I did not go through it as no one at the time was talking about it. Just trying to add perspective for an eager future student wanting to take this class.",

            "comment": "I took this class too, and while it was disorganized, I do think the grading was very generous. Almost half the class got an A+. He also told us from like week 2 that the daily problems were worth 0.1% each, so replacing the assignments with them worked fine. He also was very clear not to take the class if you couldn't do the GYNR from day one, so people that had issues with that I don't feel bad for, they had plenty of time to drop the class. While I think his communication/organization could be better, this was kinda the easiest class to get an A+ in I have ever taken. If you have the time for it and put in the brute force work you just automatically get an A+. I was fine with that because it's a good excuse to do practice problems, which will help you in interviews, and boost your GPA at the same time.",

I am so behind on the homework and failing all the quizzes. I legit can't even do the corrections because I just do not get the material. If I fail this class, I don't graduate, and I'm freaking out. For context, I current;y have a 4.0, but this class just isn't working out with how my brain works. This post is a last-ditch wail into the abyss to see if anyone in my class is on Reddit and willing to help me catch up on the homework at least.",

    "postText": "Hello!\n\nYour girl got a ligament injury and urgent care is taking time to refer her to an orthopaedic surgeon. I wanted to see if Columbia Health is faster. But I am literally unable to walk and I find the entrance to Columbia Health (from when I visited) to be quite restrictive. \n\nI live off campus so the plan is to Uber there. I am not sure what\u2019s the best way to get there - are there any accessible entrances I have missed so far? I know about the elevator, I am talking about into the building. \n\n(I am a new grad student)",

I think academically it definitely can be difficult, though not as difficult as other engineering majors like MechE or CompE. I\u2019m interning this summer, but I found it all on my own so I don\u2019t really think I can give you much insight on connections here.\n\nIf you have any specific questions about the program, though, feel free to DM me and I\u2019ll answer what I can.",

            "comment": "- being in new york is unparalleled. like ik you know but there truly is no other place like it but the fact that you have a built in community in manhattan is MAJOR for developing social network post grad. any college can get you a job in new york, very few can give you such a cool and huge group of people to grab a beer with after you clock out. \n- if you do your readings/ try not to spend the entire lecture online shopping/ do the work of finding professors and courses you click with during shopping period- you will get a huge amount out of classes (including the dreaded core curriculum). i came in a little bit cocky and have been continuously humbled and amazed at how much more i have to learn. columbia makes you aware of how vast and beautiful ideas can be and truly provides you with the skills to become a lifelong learner. Also- everyone hates the core but then you realize junior year that everything references everything and you need to just read the fucking bible and plato once in ur life to understand what ppl are referring to in higher level work. \n- sunsets in riverside, late night deli BEC coming home drunk from the club wearing all leather, first snowfall, seeing the tree lighting, etc. etc.",

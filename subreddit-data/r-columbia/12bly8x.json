I graduated three years ago and both my uni ID main address and alias address (firstname.lastname) work the same for email.  \n\nI believe the setting up a separate alumni email address is legacy from when before Lionmail was powered by Google.  The option is still there, but not as necessary given you retain your @columbia.edu address.",

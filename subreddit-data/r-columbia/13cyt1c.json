    "postText": "Hi, can someone please explain what should we do on this survey ? While applying for columbia masters program, in the application I gave my toefl mybest scores with official toefl report while submitting the application and was admitted and my doubt was sending the mybest score would cause any issues ? Thee actual test score in the official report that I gave to them while applying was anyways &gt; 100 (104 to be precise which is greater than their minimum requirement of 100 for ms students) but I just mentioned my self reported scores as mybest score (106).",

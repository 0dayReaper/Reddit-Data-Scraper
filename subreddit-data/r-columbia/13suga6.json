    "postText": "Hi, I was recently admitted in the Data science grad program at columbia and I dont know where to apply for aid. I'm also not sure how the aid system works in general or how much I'd be expected to get since my parents dont make a lot of money. Would anyone know the answer to these questions or tell me who I can talk to? Apologies if this has been asked before.",

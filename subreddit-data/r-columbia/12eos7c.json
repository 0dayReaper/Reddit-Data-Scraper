    "postText": "Hi all. I'm a grad student in the engineering school. I was a humanities student undergrad + I'm interested in auditing a class in GS/CC. I'm wondering if any student/recent grad has any recommendations on a class to audit within the English/Psychology/Art History/Sociology or related department. I'm hoping to find a class that I can mostly observe and is primarily lecture-style.",

    "postText": "Hi! I'm an incoming freshman at CC. I was wondering if the course schedule below is alright for my first year--I'm planning on majoring in Neuroscience on a pre-med track. I'm not sure if the courseload will be too much/too little/on par w/ pre-med requirements, any advice would be great. Thank you!\n\nFirst Semester\n\n* LitHum\n* UW/FroSci\n* Calc I\n* Language\n* Intro Psych (Not sure if I should take this during second semester or not at all during first year)\n\nSecond Semester\n\n* LitHum\n* UW/FroSci\n* Gen Chem I \n* Gen Chem Lab\n* Language",

            "comment": "You should take Gen Chem I in your first semester and Gen Chem II in the second, so that you will have the year of Gen Chem you need to take Intro Bio in your sophomore year.\n\nIf you took calculus in high school and did OK, you probably have enough knowledge to take Gen Chem I without taking Calc I first, though eventually you will need to take some calc. If you took AP or IB chem in high school and scored high enough to earn credit, you may want to take the chemistry placement exam and see if you place into Intensive Second-Semester Gen Chem, which is nice because you would take that class in the fall and Chem Lab in the spring. (This would only work if you have actual credit coming to you from an exam--AP, IB, A Level and a few others. Just placing into Intensive will not give you enough chemistry credit for premed.)\n\nThese are questions you will have plenty of time to discuss with your advisor during NSOP.",

The latter doesn't work, so you need to take UW in your first semester if you want to take all the classes you plan to take.",

The registrar won't remove you from the class if you don't have calculus on your transcript (like if you don't get AP credit). A friend of mine took Gen Chem without ever having taken Calculus\u2014didn't even take AP Calc. Also, you don't need calculus for Gen Chem. Calculus is not used in the curriculum.",

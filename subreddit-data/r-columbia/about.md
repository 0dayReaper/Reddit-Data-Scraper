Description:

The unofficial subreddit of Columbia University and the Morningside Heights community in New York, NY.

Rules:

Don't be an asshole: No name-calling, bullying, threatening, or harassment. See [Reddit's Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) and the [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). Violators may be banned with or without warning.

Absolutely no racist, homophobic, transphobic, anti-Semitic, etc. posts, content, or comments.: Violators will be immediately and permanently banned without warning. There will be no possibility of review or discussion. All historic comments or posts may also be reviewed for removal as well.

In consideration of whether or not content violates this policy, context will be fully considered and understood. Coded language that creates the same discriminatory effect as direct language, commentary, or content will result in the same consequence.

Don't make posts about or related to admissions: Every applicant is different, Columbia Admissions doesn't reveal any of their criteria, and no one is actually qualified to give you good, specific advice. Instead of submitting your own post asking about your chances of admission or other intricacies of the process, add a comment to an existing thread.

Posts related to admissions considerations are equally disallowed.

Don't Post Spam: Users who post soliciting material or promotional links (whether or not they are affiliated with Columbia) for events, services, products, surveys etc. WITHOUT to moderator approval will have their posts removed and face possible ban.

Misinformation/Divisive Rhetoric Pertaining to Columbia's Various Schools, &amp; Toxicity  Is Prohibited: Misinformation/Defamatory comments about Columbia's various schools and unsubstantiated claims about the students who belong to them are unequivocally prohibited. 

Moreover, disparaging and baiting comments/posts that seek to incite division among Columbia's undergraduate colleges are not permitted. Users with repeat offenses will be permabanned.

Low-effort toxicity such as “Columbia is (negative statement)” or “(personal grievance or issue)” with no ask or discussion is also prohibited.

No dating or “personals” content allowed: This is not a dating sub or app. Please take all “personals”, partner searching, or dating posts elsewhere. Offending posts will be locked and/or removed.

No throwaway accounts allowed: New accounts are not able to participate in discussions because they are most often used to post harassing, threatening, spamming, violent, homophobic, racist, etc. content. This behavior makes r/Columbia an unsafe place for all of us.

Some users may have a compelling reason to use a throwaway. Unfortunately, this privilege has been ruined for everyone by abhorrent behavior related to throwaway accounts.

Automoderater will remove all content posted by throwaway accounts. No exceptions.

Still, there is a substantial lack of information on how it works, so any intel on it would be excellent, as it would be for the other International Dual Degree Programmes offered by Columbia.  \n\n\nAlso, it states on their website that students shall be studying at GS and not CC, how much of a difference does that make in the social/economic life of UG Students?",

            "comment": "Definitely communicate your condition with your advisor, your department head. You can also email professors ahead of time to let them know about your health. I would also think about reaching out to someone in Disability Services. I suffered from severe depression for years while doing my MA part-time. Columbia could have accommodated my disability, but I was absolutely ashamed of my condition and saw it as a fault. I wish I had advocated for my self and my condition better, but hindsight is 20/20.\n\nLower level classes tend to be easier (courses numbered 100, 200 or 1000, 2000). I would see if you can take some intro classes in humanities, social sciences and/or interdisciplinary subjects. Think classes that combine ethnic studies with literature. It might be a good time too to knock out gen eds, classes required for graduation like art, music, painting, drawing,etc. Not that these are easy, but they require a different level of study/commitment which might be easier for you. Check professor ratings on CULPA and Rate My Professor to see who is a more generous grader.\n\nFeel better, OP :)",

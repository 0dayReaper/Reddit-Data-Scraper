I\u2019m thinking of gifting him an Arturia mini lab mkii. I remember there being some guidelines on what we can gift and what we cannot, any ideas?",

(In fact, they can make some professors feel uncomfortable.)\n\nWhat is always welcome is notes or cards (email is fine, but a physical card is even nicer) with a couple of lines about what you appreciated about your professor's mentorship/teaching/advice/whatever. \n\nI can't speak for everyone, of course, but personally I do what I do because I like helping my students, not for recognition or rewards. So for me, thank-you cards are a lovely confirmation that I've helped in some way. And also a nice reminder of favorite mentees even years later.",

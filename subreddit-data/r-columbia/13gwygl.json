The difference between an 8 and a 9 is 10 thousand dollars on extra tuition fees on courses that give 0 credits. You absolutely should practice a few hours for it. I can give you the contact of a teacher who helped me out with the test. I only took one 45 minute session with as practice and that was enough for a 9. I suggest you take a few of them just to be safe.",

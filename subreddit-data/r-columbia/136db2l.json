I\u2019ve started apartment hunting and have found one that I really like.\nCould y\u2019all please let me know what documents should I be prepared with. What if I don\u2019t have a guarantor in New York, what should I do then? \nAnd since it\u2019s only May, I\u2019m yet to get my visa so what all can I show them for them to give me the place.\nI\u2019m from India BTW and the other two roommates are Americans.\n\nThanks in advance!!",

    "postText": "hi! Know it\u2019s a long shot, but wanted to see if anyone had ever had any luck getting a partial refund from Columbia Housing. \n\nI\u2019ve been dealing with a horrible rodent infestation in my suite for the past year, and despite submitting &gt;10 maintenance requests and calling Hartley repeatedly the situation has only worsened. \n\nwas hoping to see if anyone knew of any ways I could petition to have some of my room and board fees refunded. \n\nI\u2019ve had pest issues in most of the places I\u2019ve rented throughout my time in NYC, but this is a whole other level.\n\nTWO WEEK UPDATE (if anyone finds this later/is interested): after sending an obscene amount of emails and getting the usl director involved, I was finally moved out of the building for the last two weeks of the semester. very much worth it. moral of the story; be wary of the 114th brownstones, and squeaky wheels get the grease.",

I've never seen rodents in any apartment I've had here.\n\nYou're not going to see a refund, however.  The most you can ever really do is get a judge to approve holding rent in escrow until the issue is resolved.",

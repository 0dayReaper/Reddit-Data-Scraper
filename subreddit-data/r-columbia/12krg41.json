    "postText": "Hey everyone! Long story short\u2026 so I recently had my scholarship rejected to attend Columbia. My acceptance was in the MA Applied Linguistics program and now that I don\u2019t have the funding or the stipend to live in NY, I\u2019ll have to apply for the scholarship again next year. Although I applied early admissions and I paid the non refundable enrollment deposit, do you think if I explained my case in more detail I might be able to defer my acceptance till next fall? How do these things usually work?",

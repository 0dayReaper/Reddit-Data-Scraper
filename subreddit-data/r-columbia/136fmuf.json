What do you guys think of the University Writing workload, do you think that's a good idea, and any other tips / thoughts you have about the course or professors who teach it? \n\nThanks!",

It's mainly other people new to Columbia and good for making friends.  I still talk to a few from my UW section years later.\n\nThe class itself really isn't heavy.  I think it's mainly that Columbia is a big adjustment for some people.",

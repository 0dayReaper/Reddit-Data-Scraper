    "postText": "As of last year, I had no problem going to outside clinics and pay just the copay without asking for referrals from Columbia. However, this year, I got a very bad sickness and have been going to outside clinics. The insurance took a few months (and several visits) to inform me that I need referrals or I\u2019ll have to pay everything myself. I called Columbia and the phone operator said they didn\u2019t do retro referrals. I scheduled an appointment with a nurse for a referral anyway.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with this?",

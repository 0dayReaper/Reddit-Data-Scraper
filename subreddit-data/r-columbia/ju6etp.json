I just took the elevator up to the 14th floor and walked down a flight or so. It's stairwell T.\n\nNot in a science program so I'm guessing it works for most/all students with an ID\n\nEdit: the 14th floor hosts the Data Science Institute and has a conference room with great views; however, their office is closed at the moment due to COVID. I plan to visit later on and ask to get photos per u/another_techie's [recommendation](https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/jl33jt/best_studentaccessible_observation_decks_at/ganesxc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).",

    "postText": "First off, I don't know much about loans in general - this is something I've been trying to learn more about throughout the summer. But currently, I am very torn as to whether I should pay off my student contribution + work study as I earn the money or whether I should take out loans for them. Personally (and again I don't know much about loans), I don't like the idea of taking out loans, as I worry that the interest may accumulate and I abhor the idea of paying off debt. I am LI and so, I've always grown up with the idea that I should spend only what I have; hence, the idea of having to borrow money greatly worries me and I'd rather just pay it off as I earn.\n\nHowever, my sibling has been encouraging me to take out loans, as I need to earn money to pay off rent throughout the summer as well as other expenses (application fees for apartments, epilepsy + hrt medication, etc). He mentions that if all the money I earn goes to the work study, I'll find it incredibly hard to afford housing throughout the summer, as well as that worrying about loans while a student takes away from the opportunities I may have at Columbia and that it's far easier to pay them off after I graduate (and presumably get a full time job) than while I'm a student.\n\nI can appreciate both sides of this argument and am therefore now considering taking out loans. However, I'd also like to hear any advice you guys have, as many of you likely have more experience with taking out loans, as well as balancing work study and savings while living in New York.\n\nEdited to add:\n\nI am also greatly interested in pursuing a PHD in clinical psychology, and I anticipate having even more debt to pay off throughout grad school.",

But the biggest one you should consider is your post-education earnings, IMO. Taking out loans so you can earn much more later is a great investment to make, but you are going to be paying off those loans for a long time and you will need to manage them.\n\nGo do some reading, talk to financial aid counselors, and learn more about your options. There are different types of loans, and you want the ones that are most advantageous to you. (Deferred payments until you're employed, serviced by the government, etc).",

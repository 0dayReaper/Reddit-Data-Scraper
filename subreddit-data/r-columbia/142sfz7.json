I say this is an alum, but trust me the notion of prestige (despite how stupid it is) is not defined by some metric cooked up by a failing newspaper. UC Berkeley gets nuked in that ranking but it's undoubtedly a more prestigious school internationally than Dartmouth or WashU.",

But It\u2019s not rocket science that Columbia withdrawing from uswn rankings is because it doesn\u2019t want to be ranked 30 again next year (I.e, it\u2019s hurting their revenue). Maybe Harvard med has a similar motive. But again it\u2019s a med school and not the whole undergrad college. So u can\u2019t make an apples to apples comparison. But there\u2019s no point in speculating. Hard data talks louder, so just take a look at Prof Michael Thaddeus\u2019s webpage full of data on Columbia which shows many problematic aspects of Columbia admin + practices.",

Also even on the metric of USNEWS I see two things. 1st that it makes no sense for an institution like Columbia to be anything less than t10, and second that if it really does fall super low, then the rankings should be taken with a grain of salt. However, I do wonder if this will affect employment or things like that.",

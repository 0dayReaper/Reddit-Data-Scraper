    "postText": "Took probability theory this semester. Generally knew what was flying but professor absolutely didn't teach anything coherent, now I'm looking at a (very very likely but hopefully not a C) B.\n\nNormally whatever, I'm a math-stat major w a 3.8, but I don't think PhD programs in *Statistics* will like to see that B. I can handle upper level stuff, just not teaching it to myself all alone with no guidance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny thoughts on the matter? Hopefully comforting, but be brutal if you all must;(",

Meet someone that knows someone and get a good letter of recommendation.",

I pivoted from econ/stat to math/stat this year when I was a sophomore, so I'm catching up now.\n\nThe stat inference class this summer is like 11 people so it's a discussion based class. I'm planning on really getting involved to get a recommendation since the lecturer(Daniel Rabinowitz) is up there in the stats department.\n\nAlso, the PDE professor this summer I actually know personally, so that should help for another recommendation.\n\nBasically this summer I'm taking Analysis I, Stat Inference and PDE, and the summer is the last semester I will have grades for before applying to grad school. So other than my currently enrolled class for Fall 23, I won't really have \"upper level\" classes, though almost all my classes in the summer and fall are advanced.",

But projects/extracurriculars that boosted your interest or path in your career, and how well you describe yourself and your interests in your essays are very important. Letters or recommendations should be from professors(!!!) that can speak highly of you. Basically, have motive, drive, enthusiasm, and be natural. Grad admissions want to know your capable academically, but are also more focused on your accomplishments pertaining to your career path. Enjoy what you do.",

As I understand it, a student got in there decades ago and removed some amount of leftover nuclear material. If I recall it was largely inert and the whole thing was a bit overblown. But in response the University cleared most of the space out and quite literally welded it shut. \n\nWe got to the entrance but couldn't get past the door. At least not without far more effort than we were willing to put in.\n\nIn general, the tunnels are pretty tame. It's interesting that they exist, but not surprising when you think about the ubiquity of underground infrastructure in NYC.",

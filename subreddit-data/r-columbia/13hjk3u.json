You should consult on a regular basis the CourseWorks site of the course, for the latest available information. Lecture notes, homework assign- ments and their solutions, will be posted every week. Topics to be chosen from among the following:\n\nThe notion and properties of Conditional Expectation.\nMartingales, Filtrations and Stopping Times. Optional Sampling and Systems theorems. Convergence, square-integrability, Inequalities, Laws of Large Numbers. Martingales in Markov Chains. Convergence of algorithms, the Robbins-Monro stochastic approximation. Optimal stopping: super- harmonic functions, free-boundary problems.\n\nDefinition and properties of Brownian Motion. Study of paths: reflection principle, modulus of continuity, law of the iterated logarithm, Skorokhod embedding and its implications. Associated martingales. Definition and properties of the stochastic integral, Ito\u2019s calculus, change of measure, the Girsanov theorem. Stochastic Integral Equations. Diffusions: connections with partial differential equations, the Poisson and Dirichlet problems.\n\nApplications: Optimal Filtering and Control. Relative Entropy and its dissipation, Fisher information, Inequalities. Basic notions of Optimal Transport, Wasserstein distances, conservative diffusions as flows of steepest descent for the relative entropy. Notions of finance: portfolios, arbitrage, hedging, optimization.\n\nPrerequisites: \u201cProbability Theory\u201d GU 4155 or the equivalent. \n\nRecommended Textbooks:\n\nKLENKE, A. (2020) Probability Theory: A Comprehensive Course. Third Edition, Universitext Series, Springer Verlag, Heidelberg.\n\nOKSENDAL, B. (2013) Stochastic Differential Equations: An Introduction with Appli- cations. Sixth Edition, Sixth Printing. Universitext Series, Springer Verlag, Heidelberg.\n\nWILLIAMS, D. (1991) Probability With Martingales. Cambridge University Press.\n\nWALSH, J.B. (2012) Knowing the Odds: An Introduction to Probability. Graduate Texts in Mathematics Vol. 139.

What are the pros and cons, and would there be students who will sell used furniture when I move in August? Thank you!",

            "comment": "Another Californian masters student nice! So am I. When did you apply for housing?I\u2019m still waiting to see if I get accepted for housing or not and I applied back in March. But for me personally go for furnished unless you plan to put up the upfront cost of stocking an apartment. Remember that this place you will be staying in will be temporary at best and chances are you might move for a job or even go home after your time at Columbia. at-least it would be less things to worry about when making the transition I figure. But if you go unfurnished there is an IKEA and Costco in the area so you could get furniture there. The only trouble is transporting it to your place if you do buy it. Just remember to have a plan to sell the furniture once you do leave.\n\nAs for purchasing used furniture I would check Facebook marketplace. I haven\u2019t quite found a Columbia second hand furniture store but what I have observed is seniors and leaving grad students tend to sell off or even at times give away furnishings if they can\u2019t be bothered selling it.",

I applied a while ago and I didn\u2019t take me long to hear back for the approval..I heard that it\u2019s much easier to get on campus housing as someone out of state.",

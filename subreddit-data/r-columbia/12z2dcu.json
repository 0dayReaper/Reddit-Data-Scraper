Was wondering if anyone knows a good teacher that could help me figure out how to write them. Heard about the writing center but I\u2019d rather put some money and get the best possible help",

The texts I have the best understanding on are: \n\nGandhi - Hind Swaraj, Marx - pretty much everything, Rousseau - the whole idea of the natural man and society\u2019s impact, Fanon On Violence\n\nThe problem is, I have the best understanding of them because I was more passionate in class when they were taught since I disagree with most of their views\u2026 I would\u2019ve loved to pair one of them with Smith or Mill and write a critique but unfortunately I can\u2019t since I already wrote 2 essays on them :/. \n\nSo basically now I have to pair two of the above texts. I have discussed some ideas with my professor and will continue to work on a thesis with her tomorrow. There\u2019s also an option to pair one of them with the movie \u201cDon\u2019t Worry Darling\u201d which could be cool! I\u2019ll let you know once I decide on a thesis :)",

I only mention this because it's worth considering counterarguments when you're writing a paper and addressing, refuting, or conceding their merits.",

I don't know anything about what Du Bois said about Marx so I can't really comment on that, but the rest sounds about right. Marx's secularized take on Hegel was very influential on his ideas about revolution and the idea of history as a process, what many today call \"progress,\" with the idea that everything that comes later is generally better than what comes before, due to our enhanced understanding of the mechanisms of things that came about with this empirical and mechanistic worldview from the Enlightenment, in Marx's case he was attempting to manifest a sort of science of the mechanisms of politics. To move on, he wants to take techne out of the hands of the proletariat and put it into the hands of the bourgeoisie, for (at least ostensibly) moral reasons.",

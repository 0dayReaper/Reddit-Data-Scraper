    "postText": "Hello,\n\nAre there any other (undergraduate) international students on financial aid? Especially those whose financial aid exceeds the tuition?\n\nI'm in the above-described position myself and struggle to get the 1042-s form from Columbia. I'm a transfer student and was on financial aid at my previous college as well, getting the 1042-s form on the financial aid in excess of the tax-exempt tuition. I expected a similar thing to happen here as well, especially since Columbia mentions it on their wbesite:  [1042-S Withholding | Columbia Finance](https://www.finance.columbia.edu/content/1042-s-withholding).\n\nHowever, I recieved no such for and got no answers from HR/AP (whatever that even is). So I just wondered wheher someone is in a similar situation or whom to contact (since the people from the contact on the 1042-s Columbia page linked above were less than helpful).\n\nThanks!",

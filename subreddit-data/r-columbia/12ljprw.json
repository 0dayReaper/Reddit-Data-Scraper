All the work you did, would these LLMs help guy avoid or the kind of work school gave wouldn\u2019t change much even with these LLMs?",

            "comment": "ChatGPT is going to make any busywork basically trivial i.e. any professors assigning worksheets or problemsets will probably have to make slight adjustments.\n\nHowever, as much as people like to hype up these AI engines any complex assignment still yields limited success. If you ask ChatGPT to write an essay on a niche subject it'll give you an essay that is at 9th grade level. Any professor worth their salt will be able to tell, at least for now.  \n\nSo essentially any coursework that requires critical analysis is not susceptible to being abused by ChatGPT, at least in its current state.",

I can definitely see the amount of work coming down in most scenarios. Do you think following this approach, would you be able to reduce the workload by 30-50%? I am looking for Columbia specific undergrad work.",

With some questions, copy and paste might not work, but it definitely provides enough help to get a hours long assignment done in less than an hour. What I have noticed is that it has options to improve writing, to check grammar, to paraphrase, to site, to write codes. And it pretty much worries me, because I don\u2019t want to use them. I am spending best years of my life as a student to learn, not only to get a degree, BUT, people using all these tools make their effortless work much more worthier than the work I spend hours on.\n\nThe other day I saw a post on Columbia Confession FB page from a student, stating they have been using a website, getting connected to some students in India and having their essays written perfectly, for very few $. Those who want to cheat, find their way around it. With or without AI. It is unfair, annoying, and some other negative words I can\u2019t think of now, but can they use it for finals, midterms, and quizzes? No. In addition to that, I am not sure how realistic it is, but I have this feeling universities will find a way around on how to control it.",

One of things I observed in American education system is that the exams are much easier than the grunt work expected from the assignments. So if assignments become easy, and someone is knowledgeable in the subject, wouldn\u2019t they simply ace the exams? The overall effort from the students might come down significantly.",

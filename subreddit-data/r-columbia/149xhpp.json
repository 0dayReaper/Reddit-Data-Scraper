How odd.\n\nThere\u2019s 2 main ways to avoid cockroaches- 1 is to not live on the first floor as that is the easiest for them to access.\n\n2 is to make your place super uninteresting to cockroaches. Clean up after every meal, no dishes left in the sink, crumbs on the floor, etc. Keep all your food airtight sealed at all times. Take out your garbage frequently.",

I had many roaches because the apartments around me were dirty. Another good tip is to make sure that all holes around pipes and in the walls are caulked. Many of my roaches came in from under my kitchen sink or through the air duct in my bathroom.",

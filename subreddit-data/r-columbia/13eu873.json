    "postText": "I'm a rising freshmen and I took Calc BC junior year HS, but screwed up the AP Exam. I got a 3 for BC, with a 4 AB subscore. The SEAS placement sheet says to start at calc II if you got a 4 on the AB exam, but to start at calc I if you got the 3 on the BC exam. I guarantee I'd be able to test out now as a senior, but is there any chance, that I could skip calc I?",

I ended up being right and had wasted my time.  Trust your instinct.\n\nMy calc 1 section here was rather intense.  I heard it was an outlier due to a new professor, but I wouldn't wish it upon anyone.  That class was absurd.",

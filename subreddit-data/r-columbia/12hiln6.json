    "postText": "I scored 449 on the placement exam for Spanish. I technically placed into Intermediate I, but I'm only one point away from placing into Intermediate II. \n\nFrom those who have completed the language core, I wanted to know if I should stick with Intermediate I or Intermediate II. My advisor said it was up to me, but I am unsure.\n\nI completed five years of Spanish in middle and high school, but it has been almost two years since I've been exposed to the language. \n\nThoughts?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kbt52o0752ta1.png?width=1494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=23b4ef5d278e201d1bdaedb2416460266fc8a5c1",

At any rate, if you find yourself in a class where the level seems wrong (like the poster below), do speak to your professor! You don't need to stay in a class that's too easy or hard just because of an exam score.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m very certain that a future career in visual arts is where I want to go. I have planned to major in the arts during college. However, I heard that the visual arts courses provided at Columbia College are more geared toward other majors who want to make their schedule less intense. This makes me hesitant. I can still pursue a major in it, but if the courses are not worth it I will prefer learning to draw from other online sources.\nDo you think the art classes here are good for improving your skills? Or should I pursue another major and spend the rest of my time refining skills on my own? Is double majoring a good option as well?",

            "comment": "The visual arts department is one of the best regarding faculty + access to the actual art scene in the city. But since we are in/past postmodernism it is more about honing in your creativity and unique approach as an artist. It is what you make of it and the people in the classes are mixed. If you want to learn from the internet then maybe it\u2019s not for you\u2026",

I do think that learning from the internet can go hand in hand with learning from university courses, though. There are a lot of people in art schools who supplement their usual class routine with more online practices, and I\u2019m merely imitating them in that aspect. Anyways, it\u2019s reassuring to hear about the exceptional faculties here. Thanks for responding!",

I do have asked a graduate student about this point, but maybe none of that is accurate. I should have stated this in my question so sorry about that! I will definitely take this class if possible. Thank you for your suggestions!",

Why does it matter if someone else in the class is some random science major who thinks art is a hobby, takes the class and is not even good/ doesn\u2019t care? You get what you put in. And, this field is a lot about networking and applying both your creativity, problem solving and social skills. If you have a complex about it then you should have gone to an art school. At the end of the day you are getting a BA not a BFA.",

Family disapproval has prevented me from investing a lot of time in art making throughout high school and, ultimately, lead to my inability to prepare my art portfolio thoroughly. I truly would love to go to an art school, so I still managed to apply to RISD and CMU secretly. Of course, I get rejected by both of them because of my underprepared portfolio. I'm sorry I haven't explained enough in my question, but please understand that I just want to be more involved in art making in college, given that my parents could no longer control my decision.",

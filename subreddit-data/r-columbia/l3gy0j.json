I like having the newest edition of the textbook as a PDF from Library Genesis, then buying an old, cheap physical edition off Amazon because I like having a paper copy. I don't think I've ever spent more than $20 on a textbook as a result.\n\nOther websites that provide similar services, in case you can't find them on LibGen, are [~~en.bookfi.net~~](https://en.bookfi.net) (edit: don't use this) and [~~b-ok.cc~~](https://b-ok.cc) (edit: taken down by the FBI), and occasionally ebooks are even available on [clio.columbia.edu](https://clio.columbia.edu/) sometimes.",

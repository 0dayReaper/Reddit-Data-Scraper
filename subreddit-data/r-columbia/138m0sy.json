Buffets and all-you-can-eat joints are a different story, and that's the conflict here.\n\nBut yeah, OP, just don't be too blatant. And don't steal plates or trays, unless you need something for sledding if there's a surprise snowstorm.",

I assume they don't have made-to-order sushi anymore and no longer sell alcohol?\n\nJJ's was also only serving food to order, only between 8 or 9 pm and 1 or 2 am.\n\nThe Wein Food Court was a great lunch option that is also no more. It was a real, if impromptu-seeming food court, with private operators running booths, including Korean (The Mill, a restaurant next to Community Food and Juice that recently closed), Chinese, Pizza Hut and others.",

I\u2019m thinking of moving near/on campus in the fall but the cost of living is really unrealistic and balancing work/school schedules seems impossible with employers that actually pay a living wage.",

            "comment": "There is so much variation in how people survive while going to school. Some folks are fully funded through fellowships, others rely on loans, scholarships, or work-study programs, some are privileged enough to have generous family supports, some have to balance working at the same time. Some have TA or RA appointments that supplement their income.\n\nAll this is to say that there is no single answer to this question. As an undergrad and master's student, I survived almost exclusively on loans and working on the side. Now I'm fully funded through a fellowship.\n\nI don't know what funding structures or opportunities look like at GS. Maybe someone else has some insight on this.",

However, I do have some insight on part time jobs. \n\nWork study actually pays well, they usually start around $17/hr, and I think it's easy to get a semesterly raise. Also, every work study job I've had except for 1 had downtime and let me do my hw. \n\nI also do figure drawing modeling on the side and that pays well, it's just harder to come by those jobs and they're not as steady. \n\nAnother unreliable source of income has been the off chance I've been over awarded, which I receive back.",

Just working 3-4 days a week I was able to pay my living expenses easily. Now I\u2019m doing an internship 2 days a week on weekdays and working weekends at the restaurant, which has been enough money to get by. Balancing work/school is VERY challenging, but I\u2019ve been able to keep my GPA above 3.9 for a whole year doing this type of schedule. It requires a lot of time management, commitment and it doesn\u2019t allow for much more time for student life/clubs/extracurricular activities, but it pays the bills.",

            "comment": "Last year I came across the Free to Play Walk to Earn/Battle NFT web3 phone app called Walken ([Walken.io](https://Walken.io)).  At first, I was skeptical and played for free, I slowly started to add a little money and reinvested some of my winnings back into the game and now earn about $25-$70 a day opening my app 3 times a day to \"battle\" for a few minutes.\n\n In Walken the app uses Cathletes (NFTS) to battle other Cathletes to earn the in-game currency Walken.  Walken is built on the Solana blockchain, which you can use as currency as well.  You can level up your Cathletes to add to their base stats, the higher the level, the higher the reward you can earn in competition. The Cathletes can be dressed in clothes to help add to your base stats to make the strongest Cathlete, you can also accumulate \" Mysberries\" for losses, wheel spins, daily quest, or you can purchase at the marketplace.  Mysberries help raise your base stats for ALL of your Cathletes.  The app has an extremely active marketplace where you can buy or sell Cathletes, as well as items. \n\n\nThe Walken team has been extremely ambitious with their roadmap, adding all different types of mechanics and ways to earn Walken.  The past couple months they have added free daily spins on a prize wheel, staking, easy-hard daily challenges, Walken Runner (mini game app), high stakes head to head battles and more to come.  The team is very active on twitter, discord, telegram, and the support team is fantastic.  The community is extremely active with users based all over the world and over 2 million registered users.  \n\n\nI have found this game to be alot of fun and an easy source of side income, I already recovered my ROI and only took about 4 months.  \n\nIf you are interested in playing immediately and want to get an early start, you can immediately earn **10 Gems + 5 Walken + 100 Mysberries** using my referral code: **AOJFMFA**",

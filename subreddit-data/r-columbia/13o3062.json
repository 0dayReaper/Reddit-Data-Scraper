Now I'm just curious about they curving styles, and how hard it is to get A-range grades in their classes?\n\n* Aise Johan de Jong \\[4042 Modern Algebra II\\]\n* Michael Thaddeus \\[4051 Topology\\]\n* Milind Hegde \\[4062 Modern Analysis II\\]\n\nI understand that they don't always teach the same classes, so I'd appreciate any general recollections on their curving schemes; it doesn't need to be specific about the classes but please share the specifics about any of these profs!",

According to him a lot of the math department \u201ccluster grades\u201d \nNothing is curved, but all raw scores are distributed on a number line at the end of the term. The idea is that students naturally congregate around certain areas of the number line, or clusters. \n\nFirst cluster gets an A, second a B, etc. so it\u2019s not curving, but you are kind of up against your classmates. \n\nAlso the average grade for our final was an F",

Miles may vary for different professor but for De Jong's class, you pretty much already need to know Atiyah-Macdonald's commutative algebra before taking the class and there is no course in Columbia that offers that. In week three, he basically covered essential stuff in commutative algebra as a \"review\" and started talking about homological algebra in week 3..and the homework consists of some category theory stuff that I haven't seen before. If you took alg 1 + 2 two years ago , this can be a bit of stretch in my opinion but I am not too sure haha",

The kitchen and lounge area are huge too! My floor was pretty social, and we hung out from time to time cooking and baking in the lounge. It's also nice to have upper classmen around.",

The lounge and kitchen are also spacious so, at least on my floor, we have a really nice social community. Granted, that isn't the case for all floors. Both Furnald and Wallach can be very hit or miss in terms of a social scene. Furnald's AC is a real plus for the start of the year but starting in October, AC is pretty irrelevant until maybe the last 2 weeks of the school year. I'd say Wallach wins in terms of laundry and food as well- you can access two laundry rooms (Harley/Wallach and John Jay) and two dining halls (John Jay and JJs) without leaving the building!",

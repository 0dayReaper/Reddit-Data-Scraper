    "postText": "Hey, so I was lucky enough to get accepted to both these schools. I want to eventually pursue the medical field after college, and I want to go to the college that is best for that purpose. The costs are essentially the same, so there is no difference with that. The Columbia prestige in the Ivy League is slightly higher than Vanderbilt's. However, what I found a bit confusing was that Columbia's premed program does not seem to be very strongly set in place. When I researched Columbia premed, I saw just a curriculum for those interested in premed. However, when I looked into Vanderbilt, I saw that they have a separate track for premed. I don't think that this is the full story, and I wanted to get the insight of students who actually go here. \n\nHow is premed at Columbia?",

            "comment": "Congrats on your acceptances! Maybe this is just me being from a public school that didn\u2019t prepare me for this school (although my friends from prestigious private schools agree), but pre-med here is tough (which I imagine is equally true for Vanderbilt). The coursework in my pre-med classes has always been the toughest (other classes being from the neuro major and the core). However, the opportunities I\u2019ve had here outside of my classes have been great (can elaborate if you want). With Columbia being in nyc, I don\u2019t know if Vanderbilt can compete with that. \n\nTo your comment about the program not being set in place \u2014 I don\u2019t really see why it would need to be a separate, defined track. If anything that sounds disadvantageous. There are classes we have to take that are listed very simply [here](https://www.cc-seas.columbia.edu/preprofessional/health/premedical_curriculum), so as long as you take those courses, you have the freedom to do what you want. It\u2019s easier to do pre-med with a bio or neuro major imo because there\u2019s overlap in the pre-med and bio/neuro requirements, but there are humanities major pre-meds, too. People often introduce themselves with \u201cI\u2019m x major on the pre med track.\u201d You also can graduate with just a concentration if you\u2019re into that. For support, there are pre-med advisors, too. \n\nI don\u2019t know enough about Vanderbilt to give you a  recommendation, but I would say pre-med at Columbia is a solid choice if you\u2019re focused on your success. If you care about having fun (which is possible \u2014 it just takes work, too)/the culture of your school, then you\u2019ll have to take the rigor into consideration.",

            "comment": "Hi, Vanderbilt student here lurking on Columbia\u2019s subreddit. I can confirm that there is no declarable \u201ctrack\u201d for premed at Vanderbilt. It\u2019s just a series of 8\u201310 courses that you are highly recommended to take before graduating, as this is the coursework that medical schools want to see in common between all applicants (see Vanderbilt-specific series of recommended courses [here](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/hpao/documents/Pre-Health_Basics-2021-11-08.pdf)). I would presume it\u2019s very similar or the same at Columbia with no declarable premed track\u2014that is, just taking this series of recommended coursework (biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, a semester of statistics, etc.). \n\nBeing premed is tough. Go wherever you think you will set yourself up for academic success more. Perhaps your support system (nearby family) will be greater at one school, or perhaps you really thrive in a very urban environment, or perhaps you really hate/love snow, and it\u2019s okay for these to be deciding factors! Though there are probably weightier things like Columbia or Vanderbilt having a specific academic major/program that really interests you. Also, importantly, a 3.9 GPA from your state flagship will get you into med school, but a 3.2 GPA from Vanderbilt/Columbia/Harvard will not get you into med school (unless you\u2019re an Olympian and haven\u2019t told us or you\u2019re gonna be the football team\u2019s starting QB\u2014this [actually happened at Vanderbilt](https://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/vanderbilt-qb-quits-football-to-go-to-medical-school/amp/) a few years ago). I can\u2019t count on my hand the number of Vanderbilt students I know personally who would still be premed (and thriving at that) had they just gone to a less rigorous, a less academically challenging school such as their state flagship. All the other things (research, volunteering opportunities, etc.) should fall in place if you have the determination to look for it wherever you are, whether Columbia, Vanderbilt, your state flagship, etc. I\u2019m inclined to think the difference in undergrad prestige between Vanderbilt and Columbia as far as it can help you get into medical school is insignificant, but hey, someone else may know something I don\u2019t. \n\nBest of luck with two great options. You\u2019ll do great wherever you end up.",

    "postText": "Has anyone taken the test to clear the foreign language requirement? More specifically, a foreign language that is not offered at CU. \n\nFrom my understanding they ask some college/professor in their network of colleges to administer the exam. Advisor is annoyingly  vague about this and other details. \n\nJust wondering what the format looks like. I guess I\u2019ll add that I know how to speak and understand the language but not to read it. The plan is to study that on my own and just attempt the exam. \n\nCan I take it more than one time if I mess it up? \n\nThanks everyone!",

Plan for it to cover reading, writing, speaking, and listening.\n\n&gt;Can I take it more than one time if I mess it up? \n\nProbably depends on the policies of the department that would house the language if offered. A common policy is you can retake the placement test, but you'd need to wait a semester.",

The test I took was reading comprehension, writing sample (essay), conversation in the language with the department head. Sorry your advisor isn\u2019t very helpful maybe try reaching out to a professor to ask",

            "comment": "Let's just get them to the NCAA tournament first before we start thinking about natties. The last time they made the tournament was in 1968, good for the 3rd longest active drought behind Dartmouth and Tennessee Tech. They've made the tournament 3 times ever. Every other team in the Ivy League except for Dartmouth has made the tournament at least once in the 64 team era. It's hard to overstate just how awful men's basketball has been post-1950. Even by Ivy standards, the admin doesn't care about investing in sports. Not to mention that the Ivy League's academic standards and lack of athletic scholarships make it nearly impossible to recruit at a level conducive to winning a championship. But yes, it would be a big deal and students would care about it a lot (it wouldn't lead to big state school levels of school spirit permanently though). It would just take a major miracle for it to happen.",

I know there used be a number of idiosyncratic regulations, but they are rarely talked about. Do they still require the freshman football recruits to collectively have an average SAT within 1 standard deviation of the rest of the freshman class?",

It's more that the ivies require their student athletes to be actual students first, which means we're never going to recruit high end talent that plans on staying in school just until they are eligible for the draft. Plus they're still going to require prospective recruits be at least somewhat qualified to attend the school, which will also reduce the pool of candidates.",

And the team is so bad because the university is unwilling to invest in having a good team. Without a change in the university's attitude, prospective recruits for ivies will prefer going to Penn, Princeton, etc that have been successful recently. The fans are of second order importance at best",

Very negative people.\"** has nothing to do with why Columbia basketball is so bad. Columbia basketball is so bad because the *athletes* (and coaches) that are choosing between playing (coaching) at Columbia and peer institutions don't pick Columbia because the admin is not interested in investing in the program (the same is true for most sports here). So unless the admin chooses to take basketball seriously, there's no reason to expect any improvement since our peer institutions will have better players and coaches. The fans being disinterested or there being a lack of school spirit doesn't explain why the program has been awful for 50+ years. It's the university's attitude that explains why.",

That you even need to bring up the men's team and reviving school spirit is peak sexism, given their recent history of losing. The women have done far more to bring back school spirit than the men. And Jaida Patrick is now a grad transfer to Miami. Can you say the same thing about any men's basketball player at CU?  I won't hold my breath.",

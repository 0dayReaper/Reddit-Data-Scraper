    "postText": "For the past five years I have been working on a personal project that aims to address three critical problems in our relationships that are driving the current dynamics on a species level: ignorance, systemic and generalized corruption, and incapacity for dialogue. Through deep and thoughtful research I have found the root causes of these problems and possible solutions.\n\nIt is essential to investigate these problems as I believe we are at risk of wiping ourselves out of existence, must likely with and an H-bomb, if we do not start promoting discussions immediately. However, I also recognize that solving these problems will not happen in the short run.\n\nTo address these problems, I have been working on a project similar to a social media, where people can discuss societal issues and possible outcomes. However, I understand that this would be a challenging endeavor because almost all of our problems have roots in familial, cultural, and religious values. It has been challenging to get people to understand that everything they were taught are straight up lies and most individuals are set in their mentality and unwilling to change their minds.\n\nSince starting my studies at Columbia, I have been trying to find people to engage in these conversations, but with no success. Many individuals are either locked inside the box or too unwilling to discuss anything that may be taken as politically incorrect. I believe that this unwillingness to engage in dialogue is a form of moral corruption and has enabled us to get to this point of a potential Third World War.\n\nGiven these constraints, I am wonderig if creating a platform and project to discuss these issues would gain traction and interest from people. How can we overcome people\u2019s unwillingness to discuss points of view that challenge their concept of reality?",

While being insufferable is not the correct pathway to make friendship or open doors, I am convinced that moral corruption is also not. It can open some doors for you today, but how many will die or lose their opportunities just because you licked some boots?\n\nI know I won\u2019t be the one to wake everybody up, but for as long as I am alive I will continue to refuse to stay quiet. If I don\u2019t stand against corruption, well, we all know what that means\u2026 I am corrupt myself.",

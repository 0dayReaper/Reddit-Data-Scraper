I had my classmates who took the CC core, of course.\n\nI do think that I have a broader worldview, a better background on history, literature, religion, and music/art than I would have otherwise. It has helped me as a professional and also as a parent.",

At least with my instructors, I felt like lit hum and cc were not particularly difficult either. If you did all the work, participated in class, and studied for the exams you'd get in the A range. I had pretty awful art hum and music hum instructors that made things way harder than necessary (grad students on a power trip/bad teachers). Fro sci is a (time consuming) joke if you're a stem major. Uwriting is graded reasonably generously, but is very time consuming. Global cores and the science requirement are what you make of it since you choose the class. Some of them are about as close to a free A as you can get here, some of them require legitimate work. \n\nOverall, I would be willing to bet that on average people have a slightly higher GPA in the core than they do their major, particularly for STEM and STEM adjacent majors. For example, I know that most econ classes curve to a B+ or so (3.33). The average GPA for econ majors is definitely above a 3.33.\n\nI got a lot out of most of the core classes. Studying classic works of art/music/literature/history/philosophy is helpful for being a generally well-rounded and educated person. I think a lot depends on the quality of your instructors though, but overall I've seen a lot more people happy with their instructors than unhappy.",

Anyways, I know this sounds like I am bragging but if you consistently get As in your STEM courses, then the core is a source of stress since your grade is VERY instructor variable.\n\nThe god news about the core is that even with a harsh instructor you can expect to get at least a B+ in the class of you do the work. Also, enjoy the core. I was an engineer and I enjoyed quite a few (not Augustine) of the readings.",

It\u2019ll be as \u201chard\u201d for you as for everyone else.\n\nBut to give you a preview, the language requirement is an easy A. You don\u2019t have to read everything for LitHum/CC/Global Core if you choose your professors wisely (use culpa.io !!). Science requirement will be more difficult for non-STEM majors, but there are plenty of courses available that are on the more qualitative side of the STEM spectrum. \n\nUW has been a pain for everyone, but it is definitely necessary. And even as someone who played varsity basketball in high school and still exercises up to 6 times per week, PE can also be a pain; I personally don\u2019t like my workouts being structured, but hopefully your future instructors are good ones. I took basketball with AHC Ty Cordell (women\u2019s ball!!) and she literally gave us freedom to just play an hour of pick-ups every time, for example.\n\nI can\u2019t give an opinion on Art/Music Hum since I haven\u2019t taken either.\n\nSo to summarize, the Core can boost your GPA if you choose your courses/profs wisely; how you go about that is up to you. I wouldn\u2019t say I haven\u2019t \u201cgotten\u201d much out of it (I never read a LitHum or CC book in its entirety, still got grades of B+/B/A-/pending), but classes can still be fun if the way the prof structures it is engaging. However, I will say that if you committed to Columbia while keeping academic difficulty as a deciding factor (of any caliber), then you made a horrible decision lmao.",

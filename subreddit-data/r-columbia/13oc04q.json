    "postText": "Hi, a package that I need to bring home came in late and my non-Columbia friend agreed to pick it up. They leave the U.S on the 25th and have no access to Columbia mail room. I would appreciate it if any of you can help act as proxy for them to come collect. I can ask him to come pick it up at Columbia but if you travel downtown-ish at any point it would be even better. Thanks all",

    "postText": "Is there a difference between these two classes? If so, what is the difference, and are they different enough to warrant taking both classes in different semesters? \n\nThe first is only offered in the spring, but the second is offered this upcoming fall, so I'm trying to decide which (or if both) would be worth my time. I couldn't really get details about the classes from Vergil, so any insight is appreciated. Thanks!",

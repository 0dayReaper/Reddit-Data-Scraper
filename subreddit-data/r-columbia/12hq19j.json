What the fuck. That's middle america tier. Just let anyone in! Worked hard? Come on in! Did you work just a bit more than usual? Come on in!\n\nI got fucking the Egleston scholarship back when there was a respectable 3.7% admission rate, they bought me the fuck out, but fuck this I should have gone to NYU or Cornell and just take the L on the debt. All the sacrifices I made for prestige and money: working extremely hard for 1530 SAT, giving up social life, giving up a dream school atmosphere and experience all for fucking nothing, all absolutely out the fucking window. When anyone can get in like this what's the point in working so hard to pull yourself out of the herd? Any fucking dumbass can make it in here. I am fucking done with this place.\n\nI'm going to be obsessed just to get post-graduate work so I can erase this embarrassment from my life.\n\nIf this was your \"target\" school and you made it in, congrats, but just to let you know as you have realized: you're not very ambitious and you settled for very little[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/cgyuy6/thirty_fucking_two_percent_i_give_up_from_this/)",

Your goals are so shallow that you throw a tantrum over such a shallow statistic that means nothing if you actually looked at the stats.\n\nBefore telling people that they aren't ambitious and settle for little, ask yourself why you yourself settled for so little in high school. If you are truly as superior as you say, then look at yourself honestly.\n\nYou brag about a 1530 SAT, but that isn't outstanding by any means. Since this is the accomplishment you decided to name, it seems that this is one of your greater accomplishments. In other words, your biggest accomplishment is being somewhat above average in a standardized test, indicating that you are indeed mediocre.\n\nFurthermore, why weren't you able to have a social life? Because you worked hard to get good scores? That just means that you weren't smart enough to be able to afford both a social life and good scores. Even if you focused on the former, I hardly doubt that anyone would want to hang out with you given your shitty personality.\n\nMoving forward, I suggest that you don't call others unambitious when your motivating factor is to have \"prestige and money.\" That is settling for little. Finally, I understand your need to \"pull yourself out of the herd,\" but isn't this hyper-fixation on ladder rankings just making you one of the herd?\n\nIt's not so much about where you go as it is what you do wherever you are.\n\nTldr: NYU basically could be an Ivy school however they choose to be cheaper and edgy. You wouldn\u2019t get it.",

    "postText": "Hello, I couldn\u2019t find a subreddit for Columbia GS and nobody seems to want to answer the phone at the financial aid office. Anyways, I am a veteran and have supported myself financially without my parents help. Will my aid be based off what my parents assets and income that is reported on the css profile? Just doesn\u2019t make any sense because you have to report your parents income if you\u2019re younger than 35 and there are a lot of independents out there.",

If you have 30% or higher service connected disability I recommend applying for VRE it covers 100% of your tuition.",

When you fill out the FASFA, I\u2019m almost certain the way it works is that you don\u2019t have to report your parents income if they don\u2019t claim you as a dependent. Regardless though, if you\u2019re independent you don\u2019t have to report their income/assets. Good luck!",

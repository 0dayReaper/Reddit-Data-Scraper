    "postText": "I know this question has been asked before but I am wondering if there is a response bias with living here. All the previous reviews seemed dated and older than a year. When I visited and asked some tenants they all seemed pretty happy w it but the google reviews and terrible things online make me weary. I am going to moving to NYC soon and will be in Tower D on a higher floor like 10ish. Wondering if anyone can give me some insight. I will be moving here with my gf and so I want to know about the safety too. Seemed like there were officers and stuff but idk I\u2019m getting spooked by all the negative online comments.",

            "comment": "You mean 3333 Broadway? Never heard anything good about it, but everyone complains about their landlord and their building, so I don\u2019t know. When I moved back to NYC, I decided against even applying due to the reviews. \n\nSafety in NYC is largely a function of two things: 1) recognizing that you\u2019re likely to stand out as an easy target for crime by doing certain things in certain places at certain times (e.g., being drunk and walking around Riverside Park by yourself staring at your phone at 4am), and 2) avoiding doing those things.",

But I'm looking forward to moving out at the end of the year.  \n  \nPros:  \nGreat price / size ratio. Safety is fine imo. There are some sketchy areas nearby, but walking around broadway alone at night is ok. Amsterdam/or the parks I feel less comfortable. Lots of good cheap food around.\n  \nCons:  \nThings break a lot (elevators/laundry), repairs are slow. And the mailroom has had several of my packages go missing and they always say it was never delivered and blame UPS (I've only had this happen here). Very noisy, we are close to a school.",

For pests I have seen roaches but they didnt stick around after I bought traps.\n\nYou'll sometimes see a dead roach or two in the hallway. So they are definitely around in the building but haven't had a huge impact on my life.",

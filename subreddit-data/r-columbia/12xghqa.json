Must I take it first semester or can I push it off to my 2nd, because it conflicts with all the classes (only 3 smh) I have registered with so far\n\nAlso am I dumb or are there still no university writing courses announced. \n\nRegistration is frustrating.",

You can only take 4 production classes that can count towards major requirements which means you'll have a quite different experience from going to conventional film schools like NYU or USC.",

I've never heard of people getting out of it, but it's not like you'll struggle without it.  It helps people get their bearings here and teaches best practices... it's also good for meeting other incoming students.  Personally, I enjoyed it.\n\nUni writing is always a scheduling mess.",

    "postText": "there's a lot of similar posts out there so apologies in advance! I was hoping to hear from a few grad students on what social life looks like. Is it hard to meet people bc other grad students are spread throughout the city? Are there enough opportunities to form communities on campus for grad students? Are there grad clubs/ are they active?",

            "comment": "SIPA has a ton of student clubs and social events! I think we have like 50+ clubs and at least 10-20 events happening any given week \u2013 including some huge parties organized by SIPASA like an annual [masquerade ball](https://sipa.campusgroups.com/sipasa/blog/a-night-to-remember--masquerade-event-details-and-important-info!/22799), where we sail on a boat around New York. You can find a list of all our [student groups](https://sipa.campusgroups.com/club_signup?group_type=13068&amp;category_tags=) here. Most people live within a 15 minute walk from campus, so it's easy to meet up with friends and there's a ton of bars / cafes / restaurants to hang out on Broadway and Amsterdam. You can also get involved with some clubs outside of SIPA, for example I'm on the board of the United Nations Association (SIPA), but I also go to events by the [Columbia Space Initiative](https://columbiaspace.org/) (undergrad), and I just founded the [Columbia Baseball Club](https://www.columbiabaseball.org/) (university-wide). So yeah overall I would say there's so many people and events that it's really easy to make new friends, as long as you take the initiative to attend things!",

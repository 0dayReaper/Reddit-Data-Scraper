You will have to take lots of classes not because they are relevant, useful, or valuable, but simply to check boxes on grad requirements. You may struggle to take the classes you need at times that fit with your job.\n\nWorkload varies from teacher to teacher, but even those teachers that assigned a lot of work were almost always willing to work with me. Columbia professors/TAs are great, and offer a lot of the support that should be admin's job. While I don't rate this as part of quality, I will also note that in my humanities program I never encountered a truly hard grader.",

After a few times, I gave up on them:\n\n* One semester I couldn't get seats in any classes I needed, because I registered late and because my job restricted my options greatly. I asked my advisor for help. He suggested withdrawing for the semester.\n* I asked a (different) advisor, \"In your experience, what is the key to success for working students?\" She said, \"Take one class at a time. Or two at most.\" I asked the financial aid office, \"What is the key to getting a good financial aid offer?\" They said, \"Go full time, and certainly don't drop below half-time.\" Diametrically opposed advice. I am not mad because one of them was wrong--I am mad because both of them were right.\n* I asked my advisor whether I fulfilled my major requirements. She didn't know. \"Ask your department head\". Reached out to him like five times and didn't hear back.\n\nI'm not the most shit-together person, but I am competent enough to hold down a job with real responsibilities. At Columbia though, the message is clear: you are on your own. We won't help you unless you ask, and sometimes not even then. It's your job to have a plan. It's your job to foresee problems. It's your job to know the right question to ask and the right person to ask it to. It's all on you, baby.",

I'm sorry, but the nature of theatre is just to eat your life and leave you with no time to study, attend class, and/or engage in campus life. I know an actor who dropped most of their classes because of a show. \n\nIf you're talking film/TV you could probably fit some stuff in, but not like a day-in-day-out thing. \n\nAlso, as someone in the arts, even though it's more solo work, I will say it is very difficult to be creative and work on *the work* when you're burnt out from school and day job work. Consider focusing on school/staying alive while you're at GS because you owe it to yourself. You can make friends with film/media students and be in their stuff, or go out for extra work or commercials. I hate to be a downer but it's hard having a whole life outside of being a student, even if you're doing part time. \n\nAcademically, you've got this. Don't worry too much. I am graduating soon and I'm grateful I quit my part time (lucky enough to make it work) and just let myself be a student for the last year. I'm applying to arts fellowships and have made some contacts at school who I never would have met outside of it. You'll find a way to make the career happen, just focus on getting through school.",

I have taken large classes where attendance isn't taken, or you had the option of attending a different section if you needed, but that was RARE outside of STEM classes. \n\nMy former roommate used to work in theater and she was non-Equity. She did off Broadway mostly and those days were 12 hours. Broadway is roughly the same, and most shows follow Equity rules anyway for breaks and hours. It's a lot. Don't underestimate the NYC transition stress. Even coming from another major city; it's a different kind of grind. One show my roommate did recommended that the actors go on food stamps because the pay was not livable. \n\nI maintain if you're going to do Columbia, DO Columbia. The industry will still be there after graduation. The professors ,the peers, the advisors are all there to be networked with and to boost good students' chances at success post- college.",

If you walk among students it\u2019s not going to be hard to find plenty of conversation of which are the easy A classes. However, although I\u2019ll always respect everybody\u2019s free will, to my estimation this is an intellectually poor mindset, one that I wish I\u2019d see less in greater academic environment such as Columbia.\n\nThe advancements of science didn\u2019t make of our world a place of no mysteries. At best, science has gloriously helped us understand a little more about life and about the universe. But there\u2019s still a lot to investigate, and a lot of problems to solve, such as systemic cultural, familial, religious, and social corruption. And I am afraid that this game of easy passing is just helping to further this negative process, as in the name of social convenience people have unlearned how to question things, even when they are clearly fallacious.\n\nMy humble and simple suggestion would be: just try to be aware of the intellectual obligations inherent to somebody that accepts the challenge of studying at an institution such as Columbia, and be loyal to it.\n\nHope I\u2019ve helped. Good luck.",

That said, my daughter already has a working actor career, and this education is a means to an end (career), and when she is acting, those working days are typically 10 to 14 hour days. So obviously, I don't want her to get burnt out trying to handle both academics as well as acting. I know she is happy when she is on sets, and if we have to choose her to be just a working actor or a working actor with a decent education at an institution like Columbia, obviously we would choose the latter. \n\nAt the end of the day, I would be happy if she figures out how to balance school and acting, and maintains decent mental and physical health. She is a resilient kid so I am fairly confident she will be able to pull it off. Still, as a parent, I am concerned and hence the inquiry. \n\nThank you for taking the time and responding with such empathy and maturity. \ud83d\ude4f",

Most people would take as an offense.\n\nNow, in response to your comments, I\u2019d like to add:\n\nIt\u2019s wonderful that you understand that your daughter should be happy and doing what she wants to do, even if it is a very hard career to succeed such as acting. A lot of childhood trauma happen (it happened to me) because of you being forced to live the life your parents want you to live. On the other hand, you expressed that the desire for a distinct education (such as Columbia) comes more from you as a parent than from your daughter, and the psychological literature leave no doubt about that: if that desire is not inside your daughters heart, or if that\u2019s not her mindset if you will, you\u2019re setting her up for failure. Most people still think that learning or succeeding in challenging studies is a matter of being intellectually capable only, but it is not. It doesn\u2019t matter how accurate of a cognitive function you have, if there\u2019s no interest, there won\u2019t be success. So I would just say: if you\u2019re daughter is comfortable and decided to move on with her life without pursuing further academic education at this time, just let it be. Perhaps it won\u2019t be what you most desire, but if it is what she ultimately wants, that\u2019s what matters for her physical and psychological health.\n\nNow, as to Columbia being intellectually challenging, this is yet another thing not very understood as far as I can see. I have chosen to take an Astrophysics class on my first semester (with an excellent professor) and was intellectually challenged like never in my life. It was an amazing experience though. But I could not avoid but to notice that the physics laboratories building is clearly the less funded (and less pretty building) across the whole campus, and is also where the least amount of traffic is seen. The inverse logics happens with the social sciences buildings. All that to say that if she is not in the mindset of intellectually challenging herself, even Columbia could be a place filled with bad and corrupting ideas. I\u2019ve seen plenty of them.\n\nSorry the long answers. These things are not very much discussed anymore, but I\u2019ve learned to look to it all, and I am very happy with this as it prevents me from falling for the traps that you unfortunately will see even in the great Ivy League.",

That\u2019s why I am asking the question here how easy it is. \n\nPersonally I would rather have her go to NYU Gallatin and graduate than not manage the rigor at Columbia GS and drop out.

One thing at a time - taking both on in a full time capacity is going to leave her falling short. That\u2019s my take.

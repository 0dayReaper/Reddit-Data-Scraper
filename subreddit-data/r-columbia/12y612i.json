    "postText": "I actually broke down in front of a professor after class and cried. They were super nice about it. But now I\u2019m going to CPS tomorrow morning because some of the thoughts I was having were not great. What sucks even more is knowing that after talking to someone about the thoughts I\u2019ll probably just have to go right back to studying for this class that I\u2019m probably going to fail anyway. I\u2019m trying really hard, I\u2019m just not as quick to pick things up as other people and I feel like I\u2019m drowning and there\u2019s just no coming back. How is anybody supposed to function at this school?\n\nEDIT: Hi all just wanted to update in case anyone in a similar mood comes across this post. I was able to see CPS the next day and talked with a very supportive doctor and got the support I needed. I unreservedly recommend CPS to anyone in a similar situation, they were extremely helpful and I feel better knowing that they're around. Thank you to everyone who commented and messaged me, I did not expect so much wholesomeness but it's nice to know the community is there. Please if you are feeling similarly, know that you're not alone and there are people out there who want to listen and help how they can.",

I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in a rough spot.\n\nI can\u2019t count the number of times I\u2019ve been in the same kind of space that you\u2019re in right now, both in and out of Columbia. \n\n*Every single time* felt impossible. That\u2019s the thing about that space: it colors the future as futile, repaints the past as pointless, and shudders even the remotest prospect of hope, let alone joy. \n\nThe reason that I can make that observation now is because I was wrong about what was impossible *every single time.* \n\nI don\u2019t know you, OP. I don\u2019t have any idea what\u2019s going on in your life. I don\u2019t have the slightest clue if you\u2019ll read this. I have no idea if these words will just ring dull and flat or if they\u2019ll pierce that shadow that I have seen fall over Morningside Heights on days and nights like the one you\u2019re describing. \n\nI *do* know that it\u2019s possible to function in that pressure cooker. I *do* know that it\u2019s possible to get help that *actually* helps there. I do know that not every day will be a bad day. \n\nAnd I know that some or maybe even all of that is really hard to believe - let alone know - right now. It is, however, true.\n\nWhat do you need right now? Sleep? Food? Someone to talk to? Can you attend to that or find someone who can help you attend to that? Maybe start with water and some sleep. \n\nHold fast.",

My experience is that Columbia purposely fosters those breaking points to reshape you for actual worklife.\n\nBear in mind that from what I have seen, very few people who care enough to express that level of emotion fail. I have faith in you and please don't let perfect be the enemy of good.\n\nTo say that grades aren't everything and just being in this school is a large accomplishment that can't be taken away. Good luck.",

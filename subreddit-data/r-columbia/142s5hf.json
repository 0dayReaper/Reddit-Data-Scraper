This is part of why Columbia fell 16 places in the last ranking, and also why poor old reed college is sitting at a ridiculous #72 rank in the LAC rankings. I wouldn't expect Columbia's already contentious ranking to improve as a result of this decision.",

When they finally did release a CDS, they bifurcated GS as its own separate report and had an extensive explanation of how people should interpret it, where most schools just release the raw report. It's possible US News was not going to accept Columbia's interpretation on some of that so they decided it was better not to play.",

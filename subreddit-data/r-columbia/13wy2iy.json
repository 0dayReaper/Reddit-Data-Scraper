I completed the 4+1 with Mailman, and my undergraduate financial aid paid for my senior year (though the 4+1 with mailman only allows you to take courses in your senior fall). For my +1 year, I was evidently supposed to be considered for need-based and/or merit aid the February before I began the +1 year, but Columbia College made a clerical error and I wasn't considered despite consistently following-up with Mailman (if you do the program, make sure to harass the college as well for your financial aid!!). Hypothetically you could get aid, but I've heard it can be on the skimpy side for 4+1 students! Hope that's helpful!",

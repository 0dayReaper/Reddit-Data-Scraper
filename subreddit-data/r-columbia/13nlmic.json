    "postText": " Hey guys,\n\nI am an incoming student at Columbia University for the program MSDS, Fall 2023. I have actively started to lookout for roommates/flatmates. If you are also looking for one or know someone searching, please do reach out.\n\nHere are some things about me.\n\n1. I'm a female from Bangalore, India. I did my undergrad in ECE and have two years of work experience. I prefer female roommates.\n2. I don't smoke or drink but am fine with roommates/flatmates who prefer drinking or smoking. I don't mind.\n3. I am fine with either option related to unfurnished or furnished apartments. I am more biased for furnished apartments as buying and selling furniture won't be a hassle but yes, keeping budget in mind, I am ready for unfurnished or furnished.\n4. My budget is 1500$ (Max) and in extreme cases, I can increase it to 1800$ but yes, the cheaper deal I get, the more it will be better.\n5. I am non-vegetarian but I usually don't eat non-veg stuff frequently.\n6. I can cook to survive, at the very least.\n7. I'm a friendly, helpful, and outgoing person and gel up with people easily. But at the same time, I won't let my roommates/flatmates suffer or feel annoyed by bringing friends to hangover in the flat.\n8. I prefer a calm and peaceful environment and expect calmness from my roommates as well.\n9. Last, but not least, I am open to having 3 to 4 roommates (including me) only but I am also flexible for 5 people at max and 1 room-mate at the min.\n10. My first preference for housing will be an apartment located at a walkable distance from Columbia. My second preference will be to have a travel thing, hence New Jersey will be fine.\n\nAlso, guys, if you are someone who's already in Columbia and pursuing your course and you are looking for new roommates, please do count me in and reach out. That will be the best case scene for me.\n\nThanks!\n\nPlease reach out! :)",

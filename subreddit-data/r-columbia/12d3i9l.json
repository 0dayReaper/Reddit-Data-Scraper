    "postText": "Just a question (for admitted students): Today, I received a FedEx package from Columbia with letters, stickers, etc. But there wasn\u2019t a t-shirt. Is that because this package wasn\u2019t the t-shirt one we requested (Request your T-Shirt!) and they are sending two packages, or because they don\u2019t like me and didn\u2019t send me my t-shirt? Thanks!\n\nEdit: Also, sorry for the \u201csus\u201d flair. Didn\u2019t know which one to use \ud83d\ude0c.\n\nEdit again: I mean undergraduate admissions.",

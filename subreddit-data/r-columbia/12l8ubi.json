    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI've been admitted to both UC Berkeley and Columbia as a chemical engineering major as an undergraduate student. I've had an extremely hard time trying to pick between them.\n\nFor reference, I honestly just want the university that would provide me with better job prospects and an acceptable undergraduate experience.\n\nHere's my line of thought:\n\n**UC Berkeley:**\n\n\\- Stronger Chemical Engineering Program\n\n\\- Ranked much higher than Columbia in chemical engineering; better reputation in engineering\n\n\\- Better weather and community\n\n\\- Extremely hard (my GPA will definitely be lower than it would be at Columbia)\n\n\\- I'd need to spend more time studying (as the courses are more intensive)\n\n**Columbia:**\n\n**-** Better reputation in general\n\n\\- Private, so more accessible club (and internship?) opportunities\n\n\\- NYC? (I honestly also think Cali's nice, so I don't know whether I should consider this point).\n\n\\- Better research opportunities.\n\n\\- Higher GPA, as the courses are easier and are not designed to torture the students.\n\n**Note that the cost of attendance is not a factor.**\n\nThank you and please let me know what you think!",

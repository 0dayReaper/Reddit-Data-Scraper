    "postText": "Hi, current undergrad here! Would love to periodically go to my friend's dorm over the summer semester who stays on campus over the summer. During the academic years I'm staying on campus. Over the summer I'd be nearby, but not in the housing. Is there a commutor access form or what is the procedure to enter the dorm over the summer? Didn't find any info online.",

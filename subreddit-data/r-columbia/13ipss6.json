    "postText": "Hello !\n\nJust discovered this community. I am accepted into Columbia for my Masters program. I am Indian, will be applying for Student Visa to come to USA. I am confused regarding how fee payment works at the University. I accessed [https://sfs.columbia.edu/bill-schedule](https://sfs.columbia.edu/bill-schedule) but I do not understand what is First Summer statement, second summer etc. \n\nMy queries are :\n\nWhat does the \"first statement/second statement\" mean ? Does the university bill us every month during the program, and are there any other options to pay for it, like semester wise or something ? \n\nIf I opt for housing using columbia's housing portal, will that amount be added to my monthly statement, along with the monthly semester fees ?\n\nAs an Indian, my bank makes it tough to send money abroad, and charges a bad rate as well. Can I make initial payment using my Indian bank account and then transfer the funds to US bank a/c once I am able to join the university ?\n\nThanks a lot !",

            "comment": "first, congrats on getting in! i'm sure you'll have an amazing experience. second - i would just call the office - they've always answered my calls and have been very helpful and responsive. my kid is graduating tomorrow and the process was weird and different even for us (non-internationals). From what I recall, they do offer installment (monthly) payment plans even for international students but they can confirm quickly over the phone. I totally get that it may be difficult to withdraw funds from an overseas account but I think there are non-bank ways and online payment gateway options that could help. good luck!",

    "postText": "Hello! I got accepted into Columbia College (will pursue Data Science or try switching to CS) and I'm considering it with my other top choices being UCLA Data Theory and Georgia Tech CS. I'm not sure if Columbia is worth it for me since I am an international student and have to pay the full cost of 85k yearly. \n\nMy parents are willing to afford 50k every year so I'd have to take 35k loan for four years, so I would be 140k in student debt by the time I graduate. Is the ivy league tag worth this large debt? Will I be able to pay it back quickly with the high starting prices of the tech industry in NY? Or are Georgia Tech and UCLA much better options? I would not need any loan to attend GT or UCLA. (If yes, any idea on which would be better?)\n\nIf I were to take up the debt, I'm thinking that I'll earn back a decent amount of it throughout college with internships, or jobs on campus (i.e. canteen work, resident assistant, helping pHD students, etc).  Is that viable? I really don't want to miss out on this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity but idk if the debt is worth it, especially considering my other options. What do you guys think?",

                    "comment": "Just a heads up to OP, cost of living can be significantly cheaper at UCLA than Columbia, especially if you're living off campus. All the decent transit options for Columbia require you live in Manhattan or the Bronx, Westide and Southside respectably. Anywhere else like Queens, Brooklyn or Jersey you're looking at 30min+ commute. While in LA, UCLA specifically, 30min radius is a lot larger of an area so you can find a decent place to live. Especially if you buy a car, which you will want to do anyways living on the west coast.\n\nThen thats not to mention things like groceries recreation generally being cheaper in LA, the latter part of course depending on what you do for recreation but you'll definitely have more options for hobbies in LA.",

Part time jobs and internships (which are notoriously unpaid in America) would be around maybe $3-5k a year max. Furthermore, I'm not even sure your career path is a viable way to be able to pay back $140k in what would need to be private loans (as you wouldn't qualify for federal subsidized loans). I did CS and the thought of that much debt (with all of the predatory interest it will accrue) and what the job market will be when you graduate is nauseating to me. I truly believe that this decision would ruin you financially for an extremely long time, if not the rest of your life. Sorry to be a pessimist, and if anyone else has any oposing (and more optimistic) views please feel free to disagree with me.\n\nEdit: maybe if you worked full time in a store during your summer breaks you would be able to make more a year? But also you would be sacrificing getting experience working in your field, which is going to be more valuable than the Columbia diploma.\n\nEdit 2: I actually knew of someone who went to UCSD for two years and transferred into Columbia to finish his degree. Perhaps this could be something to look into for you with UCLA?",

That\u2019s why stories of disappointment constantly struggle with stories of hope. It\u2019s uncomfortable to think about such things, but long-term success isn\u2019t about ignoring majority outcomes in favor of a desired outcome.\n\nBefore accounting for unearned status and ability, it is more rational to assume an individual will be a part of the 99% than the 1%. How many people apply to the IA positions and how many would have if they had the time to apply? Were a majority of applicants accepted? Do the same for internships.\n\nAnecdotes don\u2019t make for good arguments especially around unquantifiable things like effort. There are a good number of students that have work-study as a necessary part of their ability to provide for their needs. That means they have up to 20 fewer hours per week to dedicate to their college experience including summer prep. Also instructional assistant work is beneficial to the assistant in ways that watching the lobby of a building is not. I know current engineers at Facebook, Amazon, and Google that were rejected from IA posts and internships throughout their entire time at Columbia. I know people who unexpectedly had to live off their summer earnings meaning nothing went to debt repayment. Without real stats, these aren\u2019t really meaningful except to say that stuff happens, in other words luck.\n\nOne way to approach luck is to maximize probability of a desired outcome. OP is asking for some experience on what choice is likely to yield a better outcome. While mitigation of debt through internships and campus roles sometimes works out, high debt burdens at high interest rates always means a tough road ahead.",

I think the price is too high to attend Columbia. Quality of life, and being able to live without the stress of debt is so important. Moreover, Columbia has a well represented international community, especially in data science and computer science courses and I often remember hearing how difficult it was for these students to get full time job opportunities after college given their international standing. And most of these students were extremely bright, talented, and hard working. \n\nAttending UCLA would not alleviate all your financial issues, but it is still a wonderful school with rigorous academics, and plentiful opportunities. Engineering disciplines are quite the meritocracy anyhow, you will go as far as you want to work. The degree can help you get in the door, but so can plane old networking. Wherever you go, I say your number one priority is getting an early internship. Work experience is everything these days.\n\nGT is also an academically strong school. Personally, I am bias against the location and I believe your opportunities will be more plentiful in NYC or LA.\n\nWish you all the best, friend.",

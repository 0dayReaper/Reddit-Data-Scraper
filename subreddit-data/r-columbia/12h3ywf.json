So some people end up couch-surfing, car-camping, or doing other things just for a roof over their heads. \n\nI'm a journalist working on a project about this experience, looking for people to share their stories. If you're interested, please let me know or use the comments to talk about it/advice:\n\nWhat's it like to balance the demands of higher education without one of your basic needs?",

I weighted the options and unless some money falls on my lap, taking this risk would be very foolish considering the cost, them not covering NOTHING at all. They didn't even send me a t-shirt. It's crazy how they can't just hand out one full ride scholarship, just one. It's whatever, for those who can afford GS, it's a wise choice and I wis them the best. As for me, I am now focus on just maintaining a good enough GPA to get into a top15 law school. I hope your situation gets better brother. If you need any advice, reach out. God bless!",

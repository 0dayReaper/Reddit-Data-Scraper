    "postText": "Hey everyone! I just finished my first semester, and was a bit disappointed with the final grade in my econ class. The grades are curved class and I\u2019m really not sure how that works :/. My flat average is 83.5 and with the median for both midterms and finals (70% of the total grade) being 67 I was hoping that\u2019ll be enough for an A, but unfortunately I ended up with a B+. Is it possible to see the grading curve? Should I try talking to the professor about it? (it\u2019s Sunil Gulati, seems like a nice guy). Obviously that\u2019s not the end of the world, I just forgot to PDF this class and now I feel like an idiot lol\n\n\nEDIT: ended up shooting him an email - he said that I was in the upper B+ area but nothing extreme. It is what it is, definitely not going to be the guy who cries over a B+! Thanks for all the responses :)",

Ex-ante, I don't even know if he has the curve laid out explicitly beyond the it ultimately being centered around the B-B+ range and normally distributed, which is standard for almost all econ department classes.\n\nFor what it's worth, I had a slightly lower flat final average (back in 2018) and got an A in the class. You should have a large chance at an A, A- at absolute worst. I don't think the distribution will be that massively different from when I took it.",

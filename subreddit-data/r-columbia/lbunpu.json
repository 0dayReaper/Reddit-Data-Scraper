    "postText": "Wed, Feb 3 \u2014 SEAS Students across campus let out a collective sigh of relief late last Tuesday as Ivy Elkins announced that, after nearly a decade of research, she had finally demystified the PhD. \n\nChad, CC \u201924, who hopes to work at Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, or maybe Google one day, said that his unique aspirations make this news mostly irrelevant. \u201cA what?\u201d he asked, before opening gmail to update his spam filters. Chad currently has a B in Data Structures and could not be reached for further comment.\n\nSpeaking with reporters at a press conference on the condition of anonymity, Elkins noted that their work is far from over \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m looking at you, dissertation,\u201d she exclaimed around halfway through, to audible moans. When asked about fringe topics, such as how students are supposed to graduate if they can\u2019t even get off waitlists, and how the university plans to keep 5,000 individuals safe in the middle of a pandemic, Elkins explained that she was \"not at liberty to demystify those,\" and referred people back to Bollinger's latest word salad.\n\nSpeaking to our reporters later in the evening, Lucas, SEAS '23, explained that he was overjoyed at the news. \"Every time I would get those emails I would wonder, has the PhD been demystified yet? I was starting to get worried. This is f*king huge\". \n\nA second student, William Cortez, noted the very personal effect this has had on his life. \"I always thought I wanted to study theater, become an actor, and follow my dreams, but after the forty fifth 'Happening now!!!' follow-up email I decided to get a PhD in Combinatorial Differential Geometry. I hope more students can see the light\".",

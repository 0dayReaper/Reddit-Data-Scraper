    "postText": "Hi all! new to the sub. recently admitted to Columbia sipa and wanted to reach out to current sipa students (or other grad students in general) to ask about what made you pick sipa over other grad programs in IR. I'm currently weighing sipa against fsi at Stanford. The costs for both are almost the same for me (with Columbia being only slightly more $)\n\nWhat benefits do you feel like you've gotten at sipa/ Columbia grad school over other grad programs?\n\nI know responses obviously will be skewed but I already reached out to Stanford peers so I'm curious as to what Columbia students might say",

            "comment": "Hey, congratulations on your offers! I'm a first year at SIPA and I also considered applying to FSI last year, but ended up deciding not to. Here are the main differences in my opinion:\n\n**1) Location:** New York vs. Palo Alto. Do you want to live in the world's greatest city with an endless amount of culture, entertainment, food, and the UN Headquarters and Washington D.C. at your doorstep? Or do you prefer living on a beautiful sunny campus in the California, but more isolated from the real world?\n\n**2) Class size:** 500 students vs. 25 students. Do you want to be in a large cohort with people from all around the world, where you can make dozens of friends based on your interests? Or do you prefer being in a small cohort where everyone knows each other and there is a more relaxed culture?\n\n**3) Policy focus:** Diversity vs. Technology. Do you want to build a strong foundation in international affairs and have access to a wide variety of different courses across security, environment, development, human rights, and urban policy? Or do you prefer to focus mostly on geopolitics and technology policy, embedded within the 'Silicon Valley' view of the world while still being able to take classes from other departments?\n\nColumbia and Stanford are both fantastic colleges with top 5 ranked policy schools, so you would definitely have an awesome experience at either of them! It really just depends on your personal preferences. As an international student, I wanted to live on the East Coast first before moving to California, so having the chance to live in New York was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me. But if you don't find NYC as exciting or you'd rather have a larger campus and nicer weather, then go directly for Stanford. Good luck with your decision!",

There's also really no pressure to be the best \u2013 you can take it as seriously or as relaxed as you want. For example my focus is on space policy, and I'm at SIPA to learn about international security and apply it to my work. However for some of the more popular events like exclusive talks with Hillary Clinton or fancy parties with a limited number of spaces, it can be really difficult to get a spot because there are just so many people. I do love how vibrant this community is though thanks to that size and diversity!",

Personally I LOVE Columbia's campus, I think it has such magnificent buildings and it really feels like a beautiful oasis in the middle of Manhattan. But you might prefer to have the lifestyle (sports etc.) that Stanford's campus makes possible!",

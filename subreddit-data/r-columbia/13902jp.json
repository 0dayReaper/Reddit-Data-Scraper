    "postText": "Looking to get some plant roommates for the summer, so if you are moving out for the summer and can't bring your plant with you, I'd be happy to take care of it to the best of my ability (as long as it's not high maintenance). I'm also open to buying your plant for a reasonable price if you are not planning to return in the Fall.\n\nWhile I cannot 100% guarantee that your plant wouldn't die, I have been a happy owner of a little jade plant since the start of the year; so far it's doing great, so I think I'm a fairly responsible plant parent.",

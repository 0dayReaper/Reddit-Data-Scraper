    "postText": "How is it like to commute from there to the school and how does my moving plan sound like? I now live around West Harlem, but every time I visit NJ it's like the state is consistently calling me to move in and I was thinking of responding to that call. I have a car to drive, and I'm paying my rent of about $1,400 in the West Harlem sharing 3 bedroom apartments with 2 other roommates. I'm probably living alone if I move to NJ. Rent budget is 2k including everything.",

            "comment": "What I can tell you about commuting:\n\nCommuting from Fort Lee. Taking the bus from where I live\u2014to cross the GWB is $3.50. The bus cross the bridge directly to the GWB Bus Terminal which leads you directly to the 175th A platform. Subway from 175th is $2.75. I take A to 168th, transfer to 1 down to 116th. Or if you live near Constitution Park, you can take the Columbia Shuttle Bus to 168th and save the interstate bus fee. It\u2019s cheaper to commute using public transportation if you\u2019re going back and forth NJ/NY.\n\nAlso commute takes maybe 1 hour. It\u2019s really not so bad as long as you plan your day appropriately! I will say\u2014initially it could be physically tiring but you will get used to it and the commute won\u2019t be that bad.",

Took about 2 hours each way, but using the trains made it fly by since I could read/scroll on my phone or whatever. The biggest downfall to commuting imo is the cost, since if you drive you have to pay for the tolls/parking and public transit can be really, really expensive.",

            "comment": "I live in Union City NJ and commuted during my time at Columbia. I'm lucky to be one of the last stops before they tunnel, but once at Port Authority you have a few options to get up to campus (I almost always walked over to the 2/3 and then transferred at 96th to the 1). Took about 40-45 minutes on a good day, sometimes a little longer if I hit traffic in the tunnel, sometimes a little less if everything timed up perfectly. Living in NJ, I would strongly suggest having a car, even if you live super close to NY for getting groceries and running errands, so be sure to factor that into your monthlies. One thing I will say about living in NJ is how much more of an effort is needed to maintain a social connection. A major part of what you get from a school like Columbia are the networking opportunities. \n\nIf all of these things sound reasonable to you, then make the move! Whatever you wind up doing, best of luck \ud83d\ude0a",

            "comment": "I live in NJ, and commuted to Columbia for three years using bus to Port Authority. I tried driving but the traffic was bad, as was the parking. I live near a direct bus that goes express to Port Authority. The bus has a through line in the mornings that avoids the traffic. Generally it took me ~1.5 hr to get to and from school. I think there are some GW bridge bus that goes from NJ to school that Columbia has, you may want to check where you have to live to use that. I drove in on days when my classes don't start in the morning. \nI love NJ and had no issues with commute, but I like suburbs and really don't like big cities, so it's not for everyone.",

It took me about 30 to 40 minutes from Fort Lee to the school by transportation, but it sounds it takes more depending on the situation. Let me take that information into my consideration. Thank you very much for sharing your thoughts!!!!",

Also, one thing I wish I found out sooner is that there are student discounts at NJ transit for bus/train monthly tickets (in case you end up using public transportation). You have to register yourself as a student, and then you\u2019ll be able to see discounted tickets in the app.",

There\u2019s a 25% student discount for NJ transit if you login through Columbia (you should be able to find it if you Google it). I\u2019m using a monthly pass from the NJ Transit App which is valid for one calendar month.\n\nThen from there, I\u2019m taking the A train towards 168th St to get to CUIMC. I know that some schools give away free MetroCards to their students, but I\u2019m not sure if Columbia participates in this. I\u2019m still trying to figure this part out.\n\nAs someone else has mentioned, it\u2019s a lot cheaper to commute via public transportation. Plus, you don\u2019t have to worry about parking in the city.",

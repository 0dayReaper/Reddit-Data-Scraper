I know Morningside is less trafficked, but there definitely should be people and cars going by at least every few minutes around the time it happened. Maybe people just couldn\u2019t tell from a distance or if they weren\u2019t paying attention?\n\nAlso, that guard box should be manned around the clock. I\u2019ve seen them empty before and never fully understood the schedule, but for all the money Columbia invests in security, they might as well go all in and pay for enough shifts so it\u2019s not *either* patrolling or manning. Especially near those steps, cuz Morningside Park in general gets suspect after dark and for some reason I\u2019ve heard of multiple instances specifically by the steps.\n\nI\u2019ve been lucky enough to have no one mess with me going through there at night, but I\u2019m sure mostly because I\u2019m a black dude in a hoodie and look like more trouble than it\u2019s worth. But I\u2019ve seen people smoking crack and shooting up, heard random yelling, etc. Also, the fact that it\u2019s pitch black doesn\u2019t help and is absolutely ridiculous.\n\nRIP to Ms. Majors, and I wish her family the best.",

I'm not great at reading statistics, but I'm not sure I'm super alarmed by what I'm seeing. Nearly all crimes in northern Manhattan are down or are within some reasonable margin of error, and \"increased by 81%\" seems to mean 38 instead of 21 murders. That's outside margin of error, but it's not immense in terms of absolute (not relative) value given the size of the city. The number of shootings seems to have gone notably up, though.",

This is why we need to uplift these communities and not  infringe on their territory via gentrification. Really, if we had universal healthcare and public daycare, these children could receive support from an early age.  We need more social programs to uplift these youths to prevent them from committing crime. It's a tragedy that he killed this girl, but it's an even bigger tragedy that the system forced him into this path. \n\n\nYou know that usual racist denying poor minorities agency bullshit that these intellectual giants so often do.",

If it could have been easily solved, it would have been.\n\nColumbia considered buying up nearby property and erecting a fenced cordon around the area just for students and faculty. That didn't fly.\n\nHow to solve the problem, Columbians:\n\nStay out of the park, especially if you are by yourself. The geography of this particular park contributes to the problem.\n\nAnd no, racists, I don't mean the street address. I mean that the park is on a steep slope, has trees, bushes, large boulders, and you can't easily sweep the park visually to determine where dangers exist, even in the daytime.\n\nRiverside Park is flatter with less visual obstructions and has cars going by at all hours. It's safer, but still not safe by yourself after dark; I don't care what race, ethnicity, gender or age you are.\n\nMost of NYC crime is a crime of opportunity. You can live in NY but still minimize being a victim of opportunity crimes.",

            "comment": "My advice would be to rush to get the uni writing time slot you want (they're all the same thing, just themed differently) and you will also likely be able to get into a global core.  They're slightly larger classes and waitlists for those tend to have a good amount of movement.\n\nYou probably will not be able to get into art/music hum.  I wasn't able to until my senior year.\n\nIf you're entering as a STEM student, which has sequential requirements, start on that right away.\n\nThe core is nice to break up your semesters with and very interesting, no need to rush to get it out of the way.",

                            "comment": "All of this is good advice.\n\nAlso, in general, don\u2019t be too freaked out if classes are all full. If a class is a large-cap lecture (as opposed to a seminar with &lt;20 students) course, and you are on the waitlist, as long as you show up to the first week of classes you\u2019ll usually be able to get the professor to sign off on getting you off the waitlist.\n\nA lot of students over-register for a lot more courses than they plan to take, for a variety of reasons, eg:\n-waiting to see which courses look easier, once they see the syllabus\n-be able to compare which professor they like better\n-as backups in case they aren\u2019t able to get a spot in a competitive seminar or upper-level course\n-if they\u2019re generally indecisive \n\nThis results in classes filling up, but a lot of those students will drop a lot of those classes during the first two weeks of the semester, so there\u2019ll be a lot of musical chairs. Which means you\u2019ll be able to get in if you are diligent and persistent and plan ahead.\n\nIn addition to the Global Core, your greatest flexibility options are generally the Science Core requirement (you need 3 sciences), which spans a whole range of different departments. Be sure to look at the \u201cScience courses for non-Science Majors\u201d list on the GS website. A few favorites that are usually easy to get into since they are large lectures and which don\u2019t really require any math are Dinosaurs &amp; the History of Life, Science of Psychology, Evolution of the Human Species, &amp; Behavior Biology of Living Primates. Stay away from Weapons of Mass Destruction, which used to be an easy-A course but recently got cracked down on and is now a ton of work. \n\nRegardless of your major, a couple of my favorite courses from my time at Columbia, which were both fairly easy, interesting, and shouldn\u2019t be too hard to get a spot in include: LGBTQ History, History of the City of New York, and Global Urbanism.",

It is great if you can register to classes you want as soon as you are allowed, but if you can\u2019t, don\u2019t worry about it a lot. There are many great courses and you can def find classes you like (the two shopping weeks change things a lot to)",

    "postText": "Is the Columbia dining plan worth getting?? I am a GS student with family but also a full time student. I never had the plan before and have been living off food trucks lol Should I get the meal plan in the fall or just eat elsewhere?\n\nUpdate: they did get rid of the 75 plan, now the minimum starts from 100\u2026 it is a bit too much for me but thanks everyone for your help!!",

If you know you like to go home right after class or prefer to cook/eat with family then you would probably end up wasting swipes if you don\u2019t use them all before the semester ends. If you\u2019re a GS student and Pell Grant eligible you will probably get offered the GS-EMS meal plan which is a meal plan at half the cost (about $7/swipe). If you think you\u2019d want a meal plan and be eligible for this then don\u2019t buy a meal plan yet because they send out emails about the GS-EMS meal plan right before the semester starts.",

            "comment": "Hey - I\u2019m in a similar boat. So your professors and advisor should get back to you asap but they\u2019re going to suggest taking an incomplete. Basically you will temporarily be given a grade of incomplete and then you will schedule a time to take the exam in September before the fall semester officially begins. The professors usually write a new exam for you and once you take it, they will grade and update your official grade. If you\u2019re a graduating senior, they will probably try to figure out how to get you in some time this month (this is the boat I\u2019m in) but that\u2019s harder to do. They will make it work if you\u2019re in that position though. Hope that helps! Good luck and feel better. There\u2019s def some gnarly bugs going around right now so you\u2019re not alone in your experience.",

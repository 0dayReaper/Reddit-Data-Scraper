    "postText": "It looks like MPH practicum experiences largely happen at health/PH organizations outside of Columbia, but could MPH students ever complete their practicum requirement at Columbia through a relevant research project in a different school/department?\n\nFor example, if SEAS faculty had an ongoing project related to public health in partnership with some entity or start up, would an MPH student be able to complete their practicum there, with the final product being a paper, poster, conference presentation, etc.?",

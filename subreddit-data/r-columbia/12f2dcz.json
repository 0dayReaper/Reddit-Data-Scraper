    "postText": "I was recently admitted to class of 2027 at Columbia College, and my parents and I are registered for one of the Days On Campus to gain more information about the school before attendance. However, New York is a bit of a trip for us from the DC area on a wanton weekend, and I wanted to ask if it\u2019s really worth it to go? I visited the campus twice, once on a walkthrough and another on a campus tour, and it might make more sense to just not go if I\u2019d be getting the same information",

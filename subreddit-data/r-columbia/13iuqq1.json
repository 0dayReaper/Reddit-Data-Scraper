Best/worst memories? Any professors you liked the most? Any tips or tricks for anything related to the major/department?",

Most of the content is intuitive and easy to digest because you see it occurring on a daily basis. Claire Panetta is one of the best professors at Columbia IMO. \n\nThe courses provided have been excellent, but it seems like they\u2019re going through a transitional phase and the courses this year are inaccessible tbh. Don\u2019t let this scare you away from the program though, I\u2019ve genuinely loved all my courses and felt that they\u2019ve became so applicable to how I traverse &amp; interpret my daily life in the city.",

You have to write a senior thesis but I really loved working on mine and am happy that the program required it. The department is small and the professors are really strong. Feel free to message me with specific questions",

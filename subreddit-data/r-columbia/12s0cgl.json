    "postText": "My bf was recently accepted to GSAS and we\u2019re in the process of waiting back from the housing lottery. I know that the website for housing says no pets allowed for any of the apartments (aside from service animals), but perusing through this subreddit we\u2019ve seen people say that they were able to bring pets in no problem without them even being service animals? So, what is the truth here, anyone have any experience with this? My bf and I have a small chihuahua and are basically just looking to see what we need to do in order for her to be able to stay with us. Thank you.",

Weirdly enough, they were okay with my 100lb pit mix, but my 17lb mini poodle was the straw that broke the camels back. Their reasoning for this was that my small dog was not a rodent and therefore did not qualify.\n\nThe housing policy says you can technically apply for and have two animals in your apartment, as long as one of them is small enough to fit in a separate enclosure when unattended. When I put to them that my small dog has her own crate they denied it and said, \"The small enclosure exemption is noted for\u00a0hamsters\u00a0(as an example), not small dogs.\"",

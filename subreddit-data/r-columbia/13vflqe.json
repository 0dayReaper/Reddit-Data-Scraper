Realistically, you can only fit two others, maybe three, but you might be spreading yourself too thin.\n\nFor STEM majors it's easier because you'll basically be the only students taking the massive intro classes. \n\nFor Humanities students, it's a mixed bag. Depending on the subject, you'll probably end up taking niche, larger lecture courses in a desired field, or exploring different fields. But you could also get into the intro course for your subject of choice too!",

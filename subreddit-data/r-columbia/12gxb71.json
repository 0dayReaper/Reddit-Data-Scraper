Like what they got from it? Was it worth it, and did help in the long run? How was it structured? Did you get any free stuff?  Feel free to add any more advice.",

            "comment": "Hey! I matched to Columbia and did ASP virtually 2 years ago. ASP is the academic success program, long story short it\u2019s just a not too long extra summer program. Think of it as just classes based on if you\u2019re seas or CC. Don\u2019t really know what criteria or reasons why they choose you or what their ultimate goal is. since it\u2019s required, it\u2019s not a matter of worth it or not haha. The classes were a bit tough and definitely not super representative of actual Columbia classes since you\u2019re just drilling those classes and actual classes are spread out over 15 weeks . Overall I had a good experience and met some of my closest friends at Columbia through ASP. \nYou\u2019ll get a stipend for supplies, our year they gave us iPads apple pencils and magic keyboards, you also get earlier registration. \nOverall definitely try and put effort in as I think they\u2019re also trying to help you determine where you should be within a math/physics etc course track (I.e if you wanna go into multivariable calculus directly instead of calc 1/2 etc)",

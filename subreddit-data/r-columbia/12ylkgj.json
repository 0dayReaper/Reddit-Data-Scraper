    "postText": "I'm an older student at 33. I have about six classes before graduation.\n\nMy student loans are going to be maxing out at something like fifty thousand and my other loans are at another fifty thousand.\n\nDue to being from a poor city school, my math education wasn't the best. So I'm not a stem person.\n\nI've been working my way through school for the last five or so years. The last year will be my sixth.\n\nI recently got wise to the need for internships-even unpaid internships- should have been something I've been up on all along. Being a work class person, I was always taught hard work before bullshit, but, what I'm realizing is it's kind of the opposite across the bridge. (Where I'm from, the rich white people always lived across the bridge.)\n\nThe school has exacerbated my isolation to degrees I never thought imaginable. To where I'm finding I can hardly speak in classes anymore. That's starting to affect my grades, which I'm starting to not really care about. I have made a few working class friends over the years who have come up to me and started talking. But generally I'm so tired from work and school that I don't talk.\n\nI am well aware that people, when they're young, run out of things to say, and start making fun of other people to become better friends. But the little comments add up throughout the years, the looks, the ageism, all that stuff.  The feeling of not belonging here is also making it harder and harder to speak in class, because I know that after class, my anxiety will be someone's icebreaker. \n\nJust recently I had a woman come up to me in one of my classes and start talking to me about privilege and other things that she thought would bring me out of my shell. I didn't really feel comfortable talking about that, but I kind of wonder now if I was being vetted for my views to the way that conversation went nowhere towards friendship.\n\nSo now I'm kind of realizing I can take out another huge loan to finish my education or leave and just kind of go back to the manual labor jobs where I'm at least accepted. \n\nA lot of other GS students have kind of pinned my lack of knowledge about internships against me, and now the narrative is somewhat established that the lack of opportunity I'm finding is simply my fault. I also have come to learn that a lot of gs people think, like me, that this is their break from a sad story into better opportunities. But my coming reality is that I have a weight around my neck equivalent to my parent's mortgage with nothing to show for it. \n\nAnyway, I wanted to post this to kind of let other FGLI people know this is one reality. Maybe they can find the money for internships and get lucky.",

Have you gone to the career center to work out options? Even with a degree in a non stem major your options are still pretty wide open. Depending on what you wanna do. The name carries weight when people see it come across their stack of applications. I\u2019m a non stem major and have gotten internships in tech. I have no idea what you wanna do but the doors open wide for you once you graduate and will remain closed if you drop out now. But with a year left you should definitely try to get a summer internship. Even look for non paid fall/spring internships. These things matter, but you can leverage your real life work experience on the resume to stand out from others who just have the Columbia name without experience. If the job itself doesn\u2019t translate directly to a different, better job the skills you learned probably do. Project management, customer relations, client acquisition, etc. But definitely get with the career center to have a place to start",

What was wrong with my expression? What am I wearing? Why are those people always looking at me and laughing? Then you go to other people like your advisors, and you realize there have been a lot of reports of ageism. Because you don't know because people won't interact with you. Just walking to class can be exhausting. I have learned like a lot of other students here to stare at the ground. Don't make eye contact. Seeing a lot of other students do that could be a study unto itself. It's the accumulated enforced isolation over years of attending that makes it hard to even be a student here. It communicates in an offhand way the honest truth: a lot of people don't want people like me here. That's why it is so hard to keep going. But I will.",

They, of course, can blame peoples\u2019 failure on whatever they want because they are insulated from consequences due to wealth and status. \n\nIf you have been given an opportunity leapfrog up the ladder of success by going to Columbia, and you squandered it by not giving any thought to how you bridge the gap between school and a career, then you need to take ownership of that failure. You fucked up.  You squandered a ton of money and time. That\u2019s the reality (maybe! Just acknowledging that I\u2019m basing this on a single internet post) and you need to acknowledge it before you make another move. \n\nSticking your head in the sand to shield yourself from that harsh reality will only reinforce the blinded approach that put you in this position. \n\nNext, you obviously need to make a very big decision. First step is gathering information. Talk to career office about your situation. Talk to academic office about what credits are truly required. Talk to financial aid and beg for more money. Do you have a SO who can help share the load? Will you be supporting kids? Where in the country do you want to live?  \n\nBe completely up front. Don\u2019t blame others. Tell them that you need their honest assessment. \n\nIn my opinion, I guess I\u2019d think that I have no choice but to finish. You will already be drowning in debt, so you may as well have a degree to show for it. But then again, that will lock you into needing a higher paying job for longer, and I get the sense that that would be a role in which you would not thrive.",

That is what I view things to be but I tried to give justifications that I don't really believe are true.\n\nI don't interact with anyone here to speak so generally. \n\n\nWell the higher paying job thing is probably just red tape. I can't speak for myself in that position since I've never seen it.\n\nI'm not mad at others, I just realize people here don't like me and I don't like them and so it makes sense not to fake a smile. I've seen people use a racial slur with the same looks on their face as I get just from existing here. There is a hatred of people like me here. \nThat I know. \nSo that's why I've been pressing for self-love and extricating myself from a place that instead of trying to understand my perspective- wants to push it out of existence.\n\nBut I will keep going like you said just because I might as well roll around in it.",

My father was in the navy because you know how that goes. \nI was thinking oh how hard my life has been and I had to confront that option so that's why I'm kinda laughing cos that will be a new hell.\nMy father told me back in the 80s you could jump to officer with a degree. That still true?",

You\u2019ve already aged out of the Marines (they want you to join before you\u2019re 30), but the Army and Navy and Air Force should take you I think.\nLemme know if you decide to pursue this route, cause I\u2019m a vet, and I\u2019ll help you make sure you don\u2019t get screwed by a recruiter.",

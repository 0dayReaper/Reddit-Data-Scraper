    "postText": "I am a rising sophomore who is looking to potentially \"read ahead\" later this summer to be able to off-load some of the CC-reading I'd have to do this upcoming fall by completing it earlier. I am curious if there are any books considered kind of \"standard\" as the first couple of books for CC, analogous to how *The Iliad* or *The Aeneid* might be for Lit Hum. While the college bulletin does list books that are covered in the fall semester, they are not sequential and I am curious if there are any books which the class tends to begin with that I could knock out before school starts.",

    "postText": "transferring as a junior to GS this Fall and I am interested in computer vision and want to do PhD in the field. it seems to join the lab I would have to take the class taught by the professor. Would it be possible for me to take computer vision ii next spring? i don't think he will let me join his lab before taking his class.. I will probably declare cs this Fall.",

I've seen a few juniors get in though, so it's doable with some luck. But if I were you, I'd look into auditing the course instead if you're dead set on taking the class with Prof. Vondrick.",

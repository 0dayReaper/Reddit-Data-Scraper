            "comment": "Hugh's class is one of the most practical electives in the department. You spend the first half of the semester learning Xcode and Swift over 4 simple apps, and then you do a team project for the second half. The class is graded easily, but the real value comes from that team project. If done correctly, you'll finish the class with a solid app that could potentially be pushed to the App Store, and you'll also have a demo that could be used as a good talking point in interviews later down the line.",

I don't think anybody got worse than A in the class, but an A+ requires a fair amount of effort from everyone. It's going to be a lot harder if even one person on your team is constantly falling behind and not delivering.\n\nOn that note, try to set specific goals each week and hold everyone accountable. A lot of teams ended up doing all their work in the last week or so, and while that can work (I can attest from personal experience lol), it's not ideal when you're juggling other finals at the same time.",

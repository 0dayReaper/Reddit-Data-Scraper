    "postText": "I've been rejected from so many things at this goddamn school. I wanted to be a writing fellow since I was a jr in high school and just heard back I got rejected from the program. I've been rejected from everything I so genuinely want to do at this school (fuck you Quarto). I feel so useless because everyone I know has positions in things they want but I'm not good enough for anything. It's so upsetting because I want to be part of these things so bad. Not to mention I was relying on the Writing Fellows for my income next semester because from what I heard it wasn't that hard to be a writing fellow!!! (fuck me right). But Jesus I hate it here in times like these I don't know what anyone expects from me. I don't know how to not be miserable in this fucking place being objectively told I'm not good enough for anything.",

Yes. But after that battle, naval strategy was never the same.",

I was obviously upset about those rejections as, like you, I was passionate about writing and thought I was pretty good at it. I'm in my third year now and I'm doing pretty well here. I make my income as a private writing tutor (pays much better than the writing fellows). It is also easy to get accepted into campus roles like preceptor, peer mentor, etc that pay equivalently and don't make you take a course to do it! I'm now on the staff/board of three different publications here, but I didn't get involved with them until my sophomore year. First year is a rough time. It will get better.",

Discrete is probabilities that get progressively more annoying but it doesn't seem to cause much trouble for most students. Fundies is logic gates and memory management with some AP overlap, students complain about fundies but I didn't find it bad at all. Data structures levels off after midterms as compared to java intro. It's a good one to take on its own or with calc. \nThe CS major accelerates up to AP then is pretty doable after that as long as you've been compounding your effort.

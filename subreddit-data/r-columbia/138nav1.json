    "postText": "I\u2019m graduating this semester and moving to Massachusetts (Billerica) for my work.\n\nI made a lot of friends here, at labs, dance classes, and martial arts classes both inside and outside Columbia. I love the vibe of New York and the people here, how loving and open they are.\n\nAnyone who has moved to Massachusetts, who can guide me on my move there? I want to keep my inner-child and curiosity alive and explore more - continue dance and martial arts, get in touch with students/student clubs (undergrad/grad) there and possibly take up a challenging course just to learn a new subject (possibly robotics/anything for prosthetic design).",

Billerica is nice and not too far from more \"happening\" cities, like Lowell (which has a great tech/engineering scene). It's also not too far from Boston, which is an academic powerhouse if you wanted to take a course or two somewhere.",

You'll find there's lots of cool architecture, parks, museums, but I wouldn't expect the same sort of \"warmth\" you get in New York.",

            "comment": "Recently laid off Class of 2022 here. I moved to Boston two months after graduation. It is a very nice city - much safer, less chaotic, a bit cheaper, and the architecture is the best you can find in the US. Unfortunately, I got laid off recently, so I don't think I will be staying here much longer but let me give you my two cents.\n\nFirst question, how many days a week do you have to go the office? If it is 1-2 a week, then I would suggest living in Cambridge or Somerville. It is a 1.5-2 hr commute with public transportation. That would be too much if you were going to the office every day but if it is only once or twice a week, I think it should be fine. It is best to live as close as possible to boston because you wont have much shit to do in billerica.\n\nAs for martial arts, which style are you talking about? If you are talking about real martial arts like bjj, judo, kickboxing, etc., then somerville has sidyodtong - which is the best muay thai gym in the Boston area. Tohoku Judo Club is also somewhere around there. Likewise, there are BJJ schools everywhere so that shouldnt be a problem.",

Hope you find a job soon.\n\nI will have to clarify about the days of work situation but I think I might commute to office frequently considering it\u2019s an R&amp;D kind of job.\n\nI have been trying wushu at Columbia (joined recently) and I enjoy it. I also have been part of lion dance. I am open to any martial art to be honest, I like wushu for the dance like feel it has. So anything that is dance like will be great. Lion dance I feel is holistic - we learnt drumming, the sequence works out the upper body and I love getting lifted!\n\nWould having a car make things easier?",

                            "comment": "Thanks dude. Speaking of wushu, I am guessing you are referring to the traditional one, but there is a style called wushu sanda, which is pretty much kickboxing with judo throws allowed. If you are interested, there is a pretty good gym called sanda\\_fighting\\_arts in Boston. I would definitely look into it when you come to Boston. I am like 100% sure you will like it, if you are into Chinese martial arts. The guy also teaches other Chinese martial arts style like Shuai Jiao and Bokh.\n\nOther than that, if you were to get a car, then it would make it easier for you to live in Cambridge/Somerville and to get to Billerica. If you don't have a car AND you have to go to the office 5 days a week, I think it would be AWFUL to commute through public means, car would be your only option. The only thing to keep in mind is Boston and Brookline (where I live) parking is a bit of an issue. I am guessing Cambridge and Somerville will be a bit easier given that they are more suburban. But be ready to pay an extra 200-400 dollars per month for parking.",

I\u2019m also curious about Chinese/southeast Asian classical dance (currently learning Bharatanatyam and ballet). Or any other classical dance form (Cossack, Georgian, etc). Any good places to check for that? Or maybe Indian classical dance like odissi too.",

Your most pain free way of commuting would be to get a car and commute from Cambridge or Sommerville, where many recent graduates tend to live. If you have to commute daily or most days, you can try to split the difference and try a town like Medford, which also full of young people and finally got the Green Line extension, or Woburn, which has been trending younger the last couple years. Lowell is close, but I just don\u2019t know it as well and can\u2019t comment on living there vs. close to Boston.",

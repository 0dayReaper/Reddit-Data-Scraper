    "postText": "Hey everyone! I am conducting a 5 minute research survey for any and all pre-med students to complete.\n\nThe purpose of this research is to determine if and how pre-medical-focused social media platforms affect student identity. This research aims to see the relationship between the use of r/premed and the development of undergraduate pre-med identity.\n\nI look forward to presenting the results to you guys soon! :)\n\nhttps://forms.gle/t1kN4xeq1xCjWn397",

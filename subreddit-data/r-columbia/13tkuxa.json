I accepted my application to a Master's program at Columbia Engineering a few months ago, and have been looking for a resource to find roommates/connect with more grad students ever since. The one linked on the official Columbia website is for a 2022 admits group, and seems to be defunct as my request to be added is still pending, and I was kicked from the undergrad FB group cuz I'm a grad student. Does anyone have any suggestions for where I can look?",

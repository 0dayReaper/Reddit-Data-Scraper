    "postText": "I\u2019m kind of lost right now. I\u2019m an incoming astrophysics major and I have taken calculus 1-3 and discrete math at an accredited community college with in person instruction. These were all free to me. My school doesn\u2019t offer calculus BC and there would be no way for me to take the BC exam but from what I\u2019ve seen none of my math credit will be accepted? :( \n\nI\u2019ve heard to be successful as an astrophysics major you have to take the honors math and accelerated physics track? I intend to take the honors math track but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m entirely skilled enough to take the accelerated physics track off the bat. I don\u2019t really know where to start with all of this but I\u2019m trying my best to figure out course selection with what I can find online.",

    "postText": "I ask the title because I\u2019m an incoming freshman thinking about how much I should budget for each month- I\u2019m looking for a summer job right now that will hopefully sustain myself throughout the school year. So far, I\u2019m making a few assumptions that hopefully others on this sub can help corroborate or edit: If a school year at Columbia lasts about 8 months, and if $400 is enough for each month, I\u2019d like to earn $3.5k-4k over the 10-12 available weeks I have to work this summer. Are these assumptions reasonable, considering that I plan on eating mostly on the dining plan, except going out maybe 1-3 times per week? I\u2019m a frugal/thoughtful spender (mostly). I\u2019m not considering larger expenses like plane tickets or move-in supplies, either. Hopefully this budget will also allow for small misc. or emergency expenses, too. Thoughts?",

I mainly did things with friends that were free and would only go somewhere food was more than 20 dollars a person maybe twice a semester.\n\nRight now living uptown, my total food budget is around 500 a month. That includes all groceries and eating out. Sometimes I'm a little under, sometimes a little over. I don't cook much, that would bring it down probably 100 dollars.",

Subway ride will be roughly $5 downtown + $5 uptown = $10 for transportation. Adding an optional alcoholic drink in is $15. Let's add $10 miscellaneous fee. So for one time going out it will cost $45 + $10 + $15 +$10 = $80. \n\nSo for $400 a month, you can go out $400/$80 = 5 times a month, or around once a week",

    "postText": "I\u2019m a recently admitted student for the c/o 27, and I\u2019m trying to decide between Columbia and Brown. I want to major in creative writing and/or film and media. I love New York and really like Columbia, but I\u2019ve heard some troubling things. \n\nIs the core curriculum incredibly hard? Does it take a toll on your mental health? \n\nWhat is the social scene like? (Is it divided based on class, race, cliques, etc.) \n\nHow does the alumni network compare to other schools? I\u2019ve heard many alumni are inactive. \n\nWith the core curriculum, do you have time to take classes in other majors and explore before declaring a major?",

            "comment": "I had the same choice 4 years ago. I ended up going with Columbia and now about to graduate, I don\u2019t regret my choice. While I\u2019ll never know exactly what the alternate reality where I chose Brown was like, I was more stem oriented and my department would have been similarly small at both institutions. But I just think there\u2019s no replacement for New York. If you have any particular desire to be here in this crazy city, then you will be poised to take advantage of things that Providence just can\u2019t give you; though it seems a very nice town. \n\n\nCore can be slightly annoying but it shouldn\u2019t be a dealbreaker. Every course is designed to be passed by everyone and there aren\u2019t all that many. As a writer you may even enjoy many of them. My social scene was kinda screwed up with Covid splitting my freshman year and sophomore year, but my closest friends came from my cohort in my small department, even some from the masters and PhD programs. Because of this I was literally able to become friends with TA\u2019s and even some Columbia admin. It\u2019s definitely an experience getting drunk together. I walk away feeling satisfied socially with my time here despite not being the most outgoing person. I don\u2019t have a billion friends from all walks of Columbia (I honestly feel like I barely know anyone from my class) but the ones I do have are solid.",

            "comment": "How many classes you must take in the Core can vary:\n\n\\--you may be exempt from the foreign language requirement due to previous language study or AP/IB/SAT II scores. Or you may need to do only one or two semesters based on a placement exam. If you are starting a language from 0, however, it will take you four semesters to complete it.\n\n\\--if you major in film, you can definitely find two Global Cores that also satisfy major requirements\n\nThat leaves:\n\n2 semesters of Lit Hum\n\n2 semesters of CC\n\nArt Hum and Music Hum\n\n3 classes that count toward the science requirement\n\nUniversity Writing\n\n(I'm not sure I would say that is \"quite small.\") Some students really love the Core--it's worth finding out more about it and reflecting on whether or not classes like Lit Hum and CC appeal to you.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a double major in creative writing and film, and I\u2019ll say that the creative writing department here is incredible and will help you grow as a writer so much, I really recommend it. The film department really just depends on what your interests are, I wasn\u2019t sure if I would do film when I came to Columbia so I hadn\u2019t really done much research into what film majors look at different schools. Here, it\u2019s very much film and media studies instead of just a film major, there\u2019s very little production based classes that you can count towards your major (4 classes) and the rest are all history classes, genre classes, theory classes, etc where you\u2019re writing essays the whole time. These classes are essential to forming your education, but I\u2019ll be leaving Columbia knowing that if I actually want to become a filmmaker, I 100% have to go to grad school to get more skills and practice and networking necessary to succeed in the industry. I don\u2019t necessarily need to do an MFA for creative writing, but that\u2019s my plan right now, because I found that my undergrad degree has helped me improve so much and I really want to deepen my technical ability and work on my character/story development more in a classroom setting. If you ever have any other questions you can dm me.",

Doing a double major is probably possible depending on which majors and how much credit you have already.",

For SEAS especially it's harder to double-major as SEAS tend to have more major requirements than CC. It is much more doable though to complete a minor because Columbia allows for courses to double-count towards major and minor requirements.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a sophomore transfer doing a major and concentration. Concentrations are easier and more reliable to complete, given that there are fewer moving parts (requirements) to consider. However, only some majors are also concentrations, and special concentrations require another major or concentration. I won\u2019t lie I\u2019m on track to complete my major and concentration on time because I\u2019ve carried over a good amount of courses from my previous university. On top of carrying over courses, I\u2019ve talked with my program directors and received permission to double-count a few requirements. With all of this being said, my biggest piece of advice is to pick a concentration if you can, plan thoroughly, and speak to your program director(s)/advisor so that you can double-count requirements.\n\nRegarding Core requirements, you will most likely have to take LitHum, CC, MusicHum, and ArtHum--that is unless you have sufficient musical knowledge to waive MusicHum. Transfers don\u2019t have to take FroSci. Global Core and Science Requirements are relatively easy to get waived if you\u2019ve taken equivalent courses at your current school. Overall, transferring as a sophomore isn\u2019t too crazy. I know many sophomore transfers who will graduate on time with little issue. But again, planning is crucial so that you\u2019re not blindsided by all the requirements.",

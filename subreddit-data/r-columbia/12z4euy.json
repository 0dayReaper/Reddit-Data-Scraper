            "comment": "The only outside scholarships that you should submit to Columbia are checks addressed to both you and Columbia explicitly. Everything else is your money to spend as you see fit. Do *not* turn checks made out to you alone into Columbia. Most of the local scholarships I got weren't made out jointly to me and Columbia, so I kept them. If I'm remembering correctly, the only time I officially had more aid and scholarships that I turned into Columbia than fees was during the Covid semester, and I recall getting refunded.

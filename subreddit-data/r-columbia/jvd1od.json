    "postText": "Hiya,\n\nI really want to come back\n\nWe did great things. They were amazing. YUGE improvements\n\nWe are confident we can make decisions for the spring between now and early December.\n\n**For undergrads, we can offer single rooms to seniors in CC and SEAS. Maybe some juniors in CC&amp;SEAS. GS will give priority approval to seniors.** GS students can apply for apt housing etc.\n\nWe will commit to ensuring educational access for people not on campus.\n\nMany undergrad classes will be virtual or hybrid. By early Dec, teaching modes will be announced for all undergrad classes.\n\nFor grad + professional schools, hybrid and in person options may be a thing. But up to the individual deans.\n\nCOVID testing program will be expanded in the spring.\n\nKeep an eye out for COVID guidance in light of thanksgiving and upcoming holidays if you\u2019re traveling out of state.\n\nThanks yall.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPrezbo",

The spike in cases we're seeing now is only getting worse and will probably last through December and into January. Until there's a vaccine, and until that vaccine is *widely distributed*, online classes will be the default.",

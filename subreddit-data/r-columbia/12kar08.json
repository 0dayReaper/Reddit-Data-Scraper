If you\u2019re gonna get a meal plan get the more expensive ones since they get closer to about $12 per meal. Also you can pay $16 to enter a dining hall with a card, so I\u2019d recommend not getting a plan and just going to the dining halls with buddies if you\u2019re gonna get the cheapest plan.",

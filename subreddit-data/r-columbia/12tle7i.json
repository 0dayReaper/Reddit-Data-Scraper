            "comment": "The experience varies widely depending on the school you are in. It ranges from wondering where your tuition money goes (certainly not to student life) to the business school which apparently had a free cruise to welcome first-year students. There is very little that is open to all students, regardless of affiliation. While each school sponsors their own clubs, they are not open to all students.   \n\n\nColumbia has the gall to specifically exclude anyone not in Columbia College or SEAS from marquee events, even though graduate students bring the most revenue for tuition. If only we had 100% full, need-blind scholarships and not the paltry promise of loans and maybe meager grant aid for those who are lucky. I see where the focus of energy and especially funding is for students--and it surely isn't us in graduate school.",

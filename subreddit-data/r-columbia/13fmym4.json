    "postText": "Alright! on the expense of possibly sounding dumb but still. So I am an incoming student to the graduate Operations Research program at Columbia Engineering. It's a 30-credit program under the IEOR department. The thing is everywhere I have looked on the official Columbia sources, the tuition is always quoted with asterisk saying that \" give the students complete this program inside one year\". Even for the funding proof I have to provide for my I-20, the funds needed to be shown, take the whole program's tuition expense as part of one Academic year. Now, generally, the trend is that this sort of program (MS in engg. field, 30 credits, not including the BA programs) lasts for about 18 months. \n\nI am very confused. If anyone from the MSOR program can shed light on usually how long the students take the program for? And doesn't 30 credits prove a bit much for one year?",

            "comment": "The tuition rate at Columbia dramatically increases every year. The tuition rates you\u2019re currently seeing are not constant. \n\nRegarding everything else, tuition is quite a bit. In fact, Columbia is among the most expensive universities in the world. They need to know that you will remain solvent throughout the program. It\u2019s a business: they want to ensure they\u2019re filling one of the finite number of seats with someone who can afford to be there.\n\nI just finished the MSOR program, by the way (graduating on Monday \ud83d\ude0e). I learned a lot. Having said that, I wouldn\u2019t recommend Columbia if other options are available to you. It\u2019s an incredibly stressful university, very expensive, and a majority of the IEOR professors are assholes (excluding Jay Sethuraman, he\u2019s one of the nicest professors I\u2019ve ever had).",

    "postText": "Hey everyone. Unfortunately, I was laid off from work this week. A friend told me that MS Express applications are still open until May 1 and that recent alumni can apply, as well. I would like to apply to the MS Express just to have it as a back-up option in case I don't get any good job offers in the next few months.\n\nThe only issue is that the eligibility chart does not mention my major which was the combined Political Science-Statistics major that was under both departments. I was wondering if any one here knows whether I would be eligible for the MS Express. Thanks!",

            "comment": "You can still apply, that major matching eligibility chart functions more as a \"xyz major in undergrad is well prepared/ suited to ABC major in masters)\". I ignored it, (econ major) and it worked out. You'll just have to put in more work to catch up in grad school.",

I want to have a backup plan in case things go south regarding my job hunt. Btw, wanted to ask you one more question. My GPA was 3.86 and I would say I have pretty good work and research experience. My friends have been saying that it is a guaranteed admission if you have 3.8+. Would you say thats true?",

            "comment": "Yes, you can skip to ODE. The primary difference between calc 3 and calc 1-2 is that it's in a higher dimension (think taking the area under a surface instead of under a curve, for example). This isn't important for ODE, though, because that class only involves functions of one variable by the definition of ordinary differential equation",

    "postText": "\nHey guys, I\u2019ve just been accepted to CU grad program, but I\u2019m still deciding and really want to take a campus tour. I contacted the admissions office, but they\u2019ve told me that they can\u2019t give me a tour the day I arrive, which is next Saturday, 22nd of April. \nI\u2019m an international undergrad student who currently lives in Mass, and, unfortunately, can only take a look at CU that weekend. \nSo, if somebody can give me a quick tour, I\u2019d really appreciate it. \nI\u2019m willing to compensate your time with a lunch or some cash! Thanks in advance!",

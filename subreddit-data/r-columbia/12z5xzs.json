Like he\u2019s saying girls who were once beautiful are ugly now because they don\u2019t have enough sleep\u2026 gag. Yes, is it true that there is stress culture and immense privilege and tons of people go into finance and those are to some degree problems (also nuanced conversations) but that\u2019s in no way to say that the school sucks because those issues completely negate any positive attributes.",

We\u2019re only allowed 3 dopamine releases per week. \n\nNobody is friendly ever, the school explicitly forbids it. You will have no friends here. Somebody tried to talk to me after class and the professor took him out back &amp; shot him in the head. they fucking shot him in the head",

            "comment": "I think aspects of it are true but my god is this blown out of water.   \nFor example, the author himself comments that there are great people at these schools, but they're only given a phrase. And in that phrase, they're only used for the author's point about other people being awful.\n\n&gt;\"Certainly, there are some amazing people, but you also have kids who would attend an Ivy no matter what\u2014the children of Fortune 500 CEOs, movie stars, Middle Eastern royalty\"\n\nAs a student, he's right. There are great people and there are people who are unfathomably rich, insulated, or some other unrelatable adjective. But where I think he's wrong is that he focuses on them and is unable to divert his focus. For me? Yeah, there are lame people or people who I feel are here not by valid means. So I think about it. And then I move on. If I didn't move on, I'd fester. I'd become miserable. *So* *don't focus-fester.*\n\nFor other aspects he says, take what he says with a grain of salt\u2014or the whole shaker. A lot of his critiques are rooted in realistic critique but are also overly judgemental. His gripes with students \"selling out\" appears to be an egotistical masturbation of his choice *not* to do that. And his comments on other people can be avoided if you just...don't hang out with people like that.\n\nCollege is what you make of it. You can try to fight a system's fist with your own fist or you can just unclench it; you can find a way to navigate college where you take it as it comes and have the most healthy, exciting, and growth-inducing experience you can. Or you can get bogged down in the system of the school\u2014*which is incredibly easy to do.* To fix this, just be aware of when it happens and how to escape it. And, what I think is most important, make sure you are surrounding yourself with the right people. Your peers can be the biggest form of toxicity, so if they engage in behaviors that aren't healthy for you then take a break or try to expand your web. It's easy if you try.",

            "comment": "Just skimmed the article to get a jist of what it's saying and I am willing to believe that a solid chunk of people agree with what is stated in that article.\n\nCollege is as it always has been, an experience that you make your own. If you want to live a highly pressurized life, you can. If you want to live a free life you can too. There is a typical tradeoff for the average person to make and it's up to you to figure out what you will do with the time you have.\n\nThere are 24 hours in a day, let's say you have 3 classes a day that would be 225 minutes or a little less than 4 hours so we are down to 20 hours, take out 8 hours for sleep you are down to 12, take an hour for each meal that is 9, say we devoted an hour to each class per day (for those you take that day) so now we have 6. That is 6 hours you can spend walking in the park or going on a nice date and this is just the weekdays, you'll get more time on the weekend! \n\nIf you want to be the perfect student you'll probably devote more of your free time to studying. Otherwise you'll use the time to make memories. The memories you make in college will be the ones you reflect upon when you are older. \n\nAs for the people, there are all kinds of people at Columbia and any college in general. There are plenty of people who I am not fond of and there are others who I wish I had met earlier in my life. That's just life. I was an introverted kid growing up, I didn't really connect with many people because no one really shared my interests and at the time I didn't know how to carry a conversation about something I didn't know much about. When I came to college that had to change, I had to find a way to connect with others so I could manage to have *some* happiness in my life. \n\nMy first memorable college experience was a decent bit like that in the article except if you replace weed with pizza. It was a night after orientation at like 2am and I found people in my lounge eating pizza, they asked me to join as there was plenty to eat, we sat around and talked about our religious beliefs and how it impacted us as people. Normally such a conversation would bore me but I was intrigued by the diversity I was seeing as I had only known Christians but now I was in a conversation with a Jewish student, a Muslim student, a Protestant student, and myself the Catholic. I learned a lot about other people that day and it had been the first conversation that had sparked my interest for a very long time (at least among people my age) \n\nI managed to find my group of friends through mutual circumstances, I wouldn't trade them for anything in the world. I managed to get a job on campus as a teaching assistant and I have really bonded with some of my coworkers and I would say the same about them as my main circle of friends.  \n\nBeing a freshman can be a scary experience but it is more about the choices you make that dictate your experience. You're an adult, at one of the top institutions in the entire world in one of the biggest cities in the world. It is easy to feel like you're trapped in a box but once you find the key to unlock that box, the environment truly is a canvas for you to make your own. I couldn't imagine how my life would be if I hadn't enrolled here. My life is so much better as a result. \n\nObviously my experiences are my own, and there are unfortunately people who suffer severe mental health issues, with these issues be exacerbated in the absence of friends and other things that make a person feel whole, the important part is to stay strong, hold your head high no matter what and talk to someone when you are feeling low. To those who have unfortunately taken their own lives since I have enrolled (and even before) I wish I could've told them that they are loved and that their lives meant everything to someone. No matter how you feel inside, there is always someone who has a better life because of something you did, and all human life is inherently full of worth. We are special because we were born, not because we attend an Ivy league, we are simply lucky that we are here (anyone who says it's not luck based is hopefully joking or is a liar) \n\nThat all being said, Columbia is a great institution with lots of different types of people and things to do. As an incoming freshman I hope you realize that massive opportunity that lies ahead of you now rather than when it's too late. \n\nSorry for the long winded response but I hope this perspective sheds some light on some of the things discussed in the article!!",

            "comment": "Like all competently-written but **bad** essays, this one is not about the ostensible subject, but about the author. *The author* doesn't find other human beings interesting. *The author* feels disappointed to be a small fish in a big pond (welcome to New York fuckface). *The author* is staying up all night abusing drugs and frequenting strip clubs and wonders why he feels depressed. *The author* is bothered that other people pursue valuable, lucrative careers while he writes envious blog poasts for pennies... and if he thinks Columbia is full of nepo babies and status-obsessed strivers, just wait until he's working full-time in journalism. If, like the author, you are a malignant narcissist, you're going to have a hard time making friends and building a community anywhere you go. On the other hand, if you choose to be interested in other people, and consider them as human beings as fully-formed, thoughtful, and capable of growth as you yourself are, you will do well in the Ivy League or anywhere else.",

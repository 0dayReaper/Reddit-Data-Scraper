I found this out from the registrars, specifically Manoah Finston, and was then able to email my department and make them hurry up and approve me. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re fine but I panicked too!! It\u2019ll all be okay",

They still read the names of people who wanted to walk but still have summer classes or even an entire semester left.

The departments then confirm who has earned the major.\n\nThis year, GS sent its lists out extremely late, so I wouldn't be surprised if there were cascading delays in finishing the certifications. \n\nAlso, just as a general note, there are often lags between when something happens and when it is reflected in SSOL. \n\nI would not panic unless you heard from an advisor actively telling you that you did not complete your degree.",

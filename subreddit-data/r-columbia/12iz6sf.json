    "postText": "I was recently admitted into both Northwestern and Columbia. I just visited Northwestern, and I was really impressed with the school and the English program (I applied to NU as an English major and Columbia as a Creative Writing major). I like that both NU and Columbia are close to thriving cities because it opens up a lot of internship opportunities and allows for new experiences. I received pretty equal financial aid packages from both. I\u2019m incredibly torn right now. I really like both schools. Can any Columbia students tell me why they chose Columbia or just some things they like about it?",

Chicago might be nice, I\u2019ve never been, it\u2019s probably cheaper to live in. NYC has more opportunities in it than probably anywhere else.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a creative career then you will likely have more luck in NYC than Chicago.",

NYC will charge $2k for a 1 bedroom within a crumbling building and think that's okay. Chicago will do the same, but charge $1500 lmao.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think a major difference OP should consider is the luck factor you mentioned... Chicago is a hub for creative ventures HOWEVER, people are less likely to support you or your business in Chicago. I'm unsure about NYC, but it's hard getting noticed in Chicago because of it.",

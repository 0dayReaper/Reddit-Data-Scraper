    "postText": "I was wondering what life is like as a trans person at Columbia, what the LGBTQ scene is like. I\u2019ve seen posts about the logistics of housing and bathrooms but I wanted to know how easy/difficult it\u2019d be to find other LGBTQ people (I don\u2019t wanna be the only trans person in all my classes), find support, meet interesting ppl, etc., if anyone (trans or not) has any input \n\nI got into columbia and upenn, and I\u2019m leaning towards columbia, but any feedback is welcome!",

            "comment": "remember Barnard is fully integrated w/ Columbia campus, and the student body there is distinctly more queer than columbia. Columbia definitely has trans students but I would say a sizable proportion of Barnard students either identify as she/they or only use they/them pronouns. Also, it\u2019s nyc \u2014 not Philly, so it\u2019s very very normal to see trans people and other gender non-conforming individuals about. Also, there are special interest groups where you can live with only other lgbtq+ Columbia students",

Every Barnard student/professor/faculty will also ask you to state your pronouns to make you feel more comfortable on campus. They also have gender-neutral restrooms in every academic building. If you want to learn more about what [LGBTQ](https://barnard.edu/dei/lgbtq) resources Barnard provides.",

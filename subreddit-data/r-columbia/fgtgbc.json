And those two areas are significantly less at risk for outbreaks than Columbia is \n\nIt\u2019s honestly probably worse for the general public since students have to disperse back to every corner of the US. Would probably be safer to keep everyone on campus but the ivies don\u2019t want to ruin their reputation with outbreaks on campus",

Because we just have to come back anyways to get our stuff out, so what's the point?\n\nI just hope this whole thing takes a quick turn for the better, however unlikely.",

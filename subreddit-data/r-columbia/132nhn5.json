However, if you can read stories and write summaries, or write about your day, or can write well enough to even fully complete an exam in that language, you should be good. Your writing doesn't need to be perfect, it can have some mistakes, but all we do for 2 semesters is learn how to read and write, of course speaking as well, but it is a given you should know how to speak somewhat since it's heritage so its less of a focus. This is for Urdu at least.",

I was in the first category and struggled a bit because I had to readjust the way how I translated my thoughts from x language to urdu.\n\nI will also say that if you have to take heritage urdu/hindi, it will only benefit you in the long run! professor aftab (the one who teaches heritage urdu) truly cares about his students and is receptive to any concerns we had in our language (re)learning",

    "postText": "Hey has anyone taken PChem here? I heard from my advisor that PChem here is really hard, and I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s anything I should do to prepare ahead of time to do well in the course. For background I took the physics 1600 sequence and did incredibly well. I\u2019ll be taking ODE in the fall as well",

            "comment": "PChem is hard but not too bad tbh. I went in with the physics 1400 sequence and didn\u2019t take ODE or PDE (up to calc 4 but that\u2019s it), and I got an A both terms. The textbook should basically be your bible, if you can do most of the problems and examples then you\u2019ll be fine.",

Again, I recommend mostly doing problems and examples from the textbook, as professors seem to primarily draw from them for exams and homework.\n\nFor second term, differential equation knowledge is probably super useful but I didn\u2019t go into it with any knowledge aside from calc BC in high school, and it was fine tbh. Calc 4 was most useful because there\u2019s a lot of triple integrals etc. that show up. \n\nThe textbook really is quite good, if you read it carefully. Some of the concepts are super abstract but if you\u2019re okay with physics (which I personally dislike a lot) then it\u2019ll be quite doable.",

Also semester 1 of the class is thermo and 2 is basically quantum mechanics so id recommend knowing ODE and some lin alg, as well as having a very strong physics background (I had none of these and did fine tho)",

            "comment": "I took pchem elsewhere but based on my experiences, the content is mostly applied calculus so brush up on the math and understand partial differentials. Aside from the math, most of the concepts are more in-depth versions of what was learned in general chemistry (thermochemistry, electrochemistry, rates and rate constants, effusion vs diffusion, and so forth). You\u2019ll also learn a few new things, like quantum mechanics (which I absolutely enjoyed). It may seem really difficult at first with all the Greek symbols but it is really rewarding to finally understand it. Keep in mind that pchem is a combination of general chemistry, physics, and calculus. So definitely review general chemistry and calculus. You\u2019ll also begin to think on a three dimensional scale when it comes to the equations (hence, the use of partial differentials to keep one of the variables as a constant). You can never get too prepared by picking up a textbook and reading ahead. Good luck!",

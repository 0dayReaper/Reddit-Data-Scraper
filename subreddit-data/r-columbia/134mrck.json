There's so much alumni stuff around the city, join the Columbia Club if you can and just show up for things. I found a pretty good community around the interests I like (squash, improv) so that's another way to make friends. \n\nOtherwise, graduating is another opportunity to discovery aspects about who YOU are. Go watch movies alone. Go bike around Brooklyn one weekend. Go take a random trip to California (if you can afford it). It's a new exciting chapter, go get 'em!",

Some just disappear and some you message from time to time.\n\nThey are still your friends and they would be happy to see you but life does get in the way. Hard to meet when you work Monday to Friday and you live 3+ hours away to the closest one and every friend seems to be living in a different city.\n\nFor some reason, only two of my friends are in NYC. Rest just scattered (including me).",

Could anyone talk about their experience with stress, competition, and how outcome driven (grades, accomplishments, internships, etc) Columbia is? I really don\u2019t think I can handle another 4 years of constantly stressing about my grades and work.\n\nDo you find enough time to hang out with friends, enjoy the city, and participate in activities (intramural, clubs etc.) alongside your 5 course workloads?\n\nEdit: majoring in CS",

Starting my third year, I took the minimum number of credits and not only did I do better in all my classes, but I also had so much time for hobbies and other things I enjoyed. \n\nMajors: Math, Philosophy",

            "comment": "Columbia is extremely stressful and competitive. That\u2019s the harsh reality of going to the most competitive school in the most competitive city in the US. CS is a challenging major for most people who don\u2019t have significant prior experience and there is also a lot of stress surrounding internships. It\u2019s up to you to decide if you can handle being in a stressful environment and make decisions to prioritize your work-life balance. Maybe you weren\u2019t able to in high school, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t get better at that as you mature. Being at \u201cthe top\u201d academically, professionally etc. will always inherently be stressful, so I would personally focus on building the skillset to thrive in that environment (not the technical skillset, but the emotional skillset to find balance in your life) instead of removing yourself entirely. If you got into Columbia, it means you can handle it. It\u2019s just a question of if it truly will be too harmful for your mental health to be in a competitive place.",

            "comment": "\u2022 Your first year is going to be a transition marked by a serious workload, especially with stuff from the Core. **EXPECT IT TO BE HARD,** but be confident that you will acquire the skills you need in order to make it easier.\n\n\u2022 As far as the city goes... that depends. I had classmates who could afford to party nearly every night in NYC and I had classmates who never went out at all. New York is a lot of things, but it's not cheap, regardless of what your definition of \"enjoy\" is. You will have access to museums and discounts on certain things, however, and, if nothing else, there's always Central Park and The Met.\n\n\u2022 Stress and competition: the former depends on how you quantify stress, the latter depends on how ambitious you are. Some students quite literally snap under the pressure they place on themselves and the expectations they feel they have to live up to. I urge you to keep things in perspective, *talk* to your professors if you're having a hard time, *build a support network* of friends and classmates, and *seek* counseling if you're having a rough go of it. Some classes are graded on a curve, so prepare yourself for that. Some classes are taught by burned-out TA's who make a Hell of a lot less money than you think. Some professors insist that you show up and participate, others don't care. \n\n\u2022 Outcomes: again, this is about ambition. Remember, however, that Columbia is a *learning environment.* Your goal is to *learn as much as possible* and prepare yourself for either work, grad school, or both.   \n\n\nWhat's great about Columbia profs is that they *want you to succeed.* Make the most of their wisdom. Make the most of the city. Make the most of your time. You got this.",

I had a hard time in my first semester since I was dealing with a health issue, but this semester has been very good so far. I have not joined any club or something yet, but have been able to easily handle my 4 classes, and my life outside college (I am somehow chill with my grades and won\u2019t kill my self for an A). I see posts sometimes from students, being stressed out that they got their first B in senior year, or complaining that their GPA is going to be 3.7. Like if what grade you get is extremely important for you, yes, you will be stressed and probably burnt out, unless you just want to chase easy A classes, which I doubt work well especially for CS! Columbia can get very competitive, but it depends on you that what you want to compete for!",

Research the professors before you sign up for classses to get a sense of workload. But then you also need to factor in time for interview prep. Grinding for Leetcode can feel like a 6th class.

    "postText": "I\u2019m a rising engineering senior trying to make my schedule for next semester. I know it won\u2019t count for my tech electives unfortunately, but I have always really loved astrophysics and wanted to take a course on it while I still have the chance to explore different interests. \n\nI have a pretty strong calculus/physics background and have taken a cursory astro course in high school, but I\u2019m also probably gonna have 15 credits already scheduled next semester. Is it enough work where I\u2019d be crazy to add it to my schedule?",

Unfortunately I don\u2019t think the professor who is teaching next semester has taught it before, tho I could be wrong? I took it last semester and honestly it  was really rough, but it wasn\u2019t the class itself, it was the professor. So idk",

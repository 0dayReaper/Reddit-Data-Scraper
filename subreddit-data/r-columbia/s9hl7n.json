Four years ago a doddering old white man (who claimed to be a president but im pretty sure that's not true) came up to me and asked for $320,000 so that he could \"educate me\". \n\nI stupidly agreed, and he took the $300k. At the end he handed me a sheet of paper but I told my friend and we're pretty sure its worthless.  I'm just really depressed because $320,000 like 2% of my dad's 14th bank account. i hate myself",

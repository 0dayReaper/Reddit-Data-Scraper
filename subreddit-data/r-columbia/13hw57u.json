    "postText": "I am an incoming freshman. I just took AP stats, and I think I am going to get a 5 on the exam, but I saw online that you have to discuss with your academic advisor if you can get credit. I am a planned finance area person(not sure major) but I'm definitely going for a special concentration in business. What does the academic advisor consider to make this decision?",

            "comment": "Rising senior here. The advisor checks 2 things: your grade in the ap stats class and your major capability through class selection. Since you are going into a business related field l, stats 1001 is super important for your major. You need it as a pre req to get selected into the special concentration(10% acceptance rate). They also check to see the highest level of math taken in highschool and your grades in that. \n\nAs for talking to the advisor, Columbia doesn't do placement exams which is unfortunate, so don't go that route. Also, remember no matter how well u did in highschool the advisor will not budge, they deal with really really smart kids every year. Essentially, make sure to finish off the year with really good grades in your math classes and especially an A(or an A+ or equivalent if possible) in your ap stats class.\n\nGood luck. \ud83d\ude42",

                    "comment": "This is actually completely inaccurate, at least for Columbia College and SEAS.\n\nStudents in Columbia College get 3 points of credit for a 5 in AP Stats, no matter what grades you got in high school (your advisor will most likely never look at your high school grades for any reason). \n\nThe only \"decision\" that needs to be made to give you the 3 credits for Stats is whether you want to claim them--you can earn only up to 16 credits from AP, and you may want different exams to count and let the Stats credit go. A 5 in AP Stats exempts you from STAT 1001, which is fine for the Special Concentration, but doesn't exempt you from the Stats requirement in the various econ majors (Econ, Financial Econ, Econ-Stats, Econ-Poli Sci, Econ-Philosophy), which is a higher-level class.\n\nSEAS students don't earn any credit for AP Stats.",

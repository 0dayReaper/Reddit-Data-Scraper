    "postText": "Hey r/columbia!\n\nHope you dont mind an Ohio State Buckeye butting in to the community. But you guys might just be the right place to ask about this!\n\nI\u2019m searching for a highly skilled, advanced mathematics tutor/engineering graduate student who is knowledgeable in all of the following listed topics. **Special attention and desire for those who are natively Japanese (or studied mathematics in Japan) and are fluent in English.** The exams I am studying for and am in need of assistance with are for an Aerospace Engineering Ph.D. entrance exam at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan. For context, I have both a BS and MS in aerospace engineering, so much of the content that is being tested upon I am familiar with. I need help honing the specific analysis methods taught in Japanese mathematics curriculums that are not covered in the standard US math curriculum.\n\nThe exams that are made publicly available to study from are listed below for your reference. If you are able to tutor on the methods, difficulty, and scope of content covered by the Mathematics A and Mathematics B exams, please comment or dm me. I will ask for some sort of proof of qualifications before we would begin. Am looking to begin sessions in the end of June and continue on an as needed basis.\n\nSerious inquires only, please.\n\nTopics:  \nDifferential and Integral Calculus\n\nLinear Algebra\n\nVector Analysis\n\nOrdinary Differential Equations\n\nPartial Differential Equations\n\nFourier Series and Fourier Transforms\n\nLaplace Transforms\n\nPublicly available past exams to study from:\n\n2021 Exam: [https://www.mech.tohoku.ac.jp/wp/wp-content/themes/joints-mech/img/examination/pdf/Problem\\_2021\\_e.pdf](https://www.mech.tohoku.ac.jp/wp/wp-content/themes/joints-mech/img/examination/pdf/Problem_2021_e.pdf)\n\n2020 Exam: [https://www.mech.tohoku.ac.jp/wp/wp-content/themes/joints-mech/img/examination/pdf/Problem\\_2020\\_e.pdf](https://www.mech.tohoku.ac.jp/wp/wp-content/themes/joints-mech/img/examination/pdf/Problem_2020_e.pdf)\n\n2019 Exam: [https://www.mech.tohoku.ac.jp/wp/wp-content/themes/joints-mech/img/examination/pdf/Problem2019\\_e.pdf](https://www.mech.tohoku.ac.jp/wp/wp-content/themes/joints-mech/img/examination/pdf/Problem2019_e.pdf)",

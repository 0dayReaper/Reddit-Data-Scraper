            "comment": "The Special Concentration in Business Management is not a degree-bearing program of study, which means you would also need to complete a concentration (not a \"special\" concentration) or major in another subject.\n\nStudents complete some pre-requisite courses and apply as sophomores or juniors. It's fairly competitive; I think lately about half of applicants have been accepted each year. More juniors are admitted than sophomores. Accepted students are guaranteed spots in the \"financial and managerial core\" courses, most of which are undergrad courses taught in the Business School, but other students are allowed to take those courses on a space-available basis. You can't just declare this Special Concentration; you have to apply and be accepted.",

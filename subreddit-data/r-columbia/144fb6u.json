    "postText": "Hi, I am an incoming freshman who is planning to become a CS major at Columbia College. I looked extensively on the Columbia website and was still very confused about the way scheduling is going to work because there is the Core Curriculum. \n\nCan someone who is majoring in CS at CC let me know what their full first-year schedule was? It would be very helpful for me (and I'm sure for others) to see what it's like. Thank you!",

You will be taking maybe one or two cs classes in addition to the core. Usually Intro to Java or Data Structures depending on your comfort and if you have AP credit.",

            "comment": "Your schedule will depend a lot on your previous experience and interests within or outside of CS. \n\nAssuming you won\u2019t be able to place out of any intro courses (1004, calc i, discrete) then you would probably take 2 of those 3 (probably 1004 and calc i) in the fall along with lithum and uw/frosci.\n\nThen in the spring you would probably take the remaining one (so probably discrete) along with data structures and either calc iii or your stats requirement, if you are so inclined to take 5 courses.\n\nBut it\u2019s a pretty big assumption to assume you won\u2019t place out of any of these and it\u2019s also a pretty big assumption that you\u2019re only curious about cs and wouldn\u2019t want to explore any other subjects. Further, if you\u2019re more interested in the theoretical aspect of cs vs ml and ai then what you do would probably vastly change. So while it\u2019s not unlikely that someone randomly commenting their first year schedule will be helpful, it\u2019s a lot more useful if you add some context for yourself.",

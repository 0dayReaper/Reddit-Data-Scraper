It is however free and convenient. The main gyms nearby are the Blink fitness, NYSC, and planet fitness at 125th (\\~10 mins from campus) and the Blink on 116th (\\~20 mins from campus). I can't speak to the quality of those, but afaik they are better resourced and not in a sad basement, but a further commute and you need to pay.  If you are very into weightlifting, JDI Barbell is where the CU powerlifting team trains.",

It's huge and very nice, but around $200/month. Easy subway or cab ride.  \n\nBut if there is a single discipline you are interested in, that's another story. There are specialist studios for weights, pilates, yoga, bikes, martial arts, cardio machines, etc. much closer.",

They did just renovate which is nice, I guess.\n\nI go to Crunch fitness on 83rd. Fantastic gym, great equipment, and it's never full. There is a student discount, but it's still like $80/mo . \n\nYour other options are Blink on 125th or on 116th. That's basically just a tier up from Dodge. Shotty equipment and it's a mess in there, though it is pretty big and only $10/mo. \n\nYou also have planet fitness for the same price, but it's planet fitness...\n\nAs others have mentioned, there's Equinox on 92nd. Not worth it. Go to the gym and work out. Who the heck needs an overpriced massage? \n\nLast, as others have also mentioned, there is JDI Barbell where the lifting club (cubarbell) goes. I hear it's a great place, but it's in east Harlem and costs $160/mo or $110 / mo w/student discount. \n\nOf course, there's also random independent gyms but those barely count.",

Honestly, I went like 3 or 4 times a week to do free weights and weight machines, and it's fine if not luxurious, if you don't mind working in or waiting a little for stuff to free up. If nothing else, it's close by, right on campus, which counts for a lot, and it helps a lot if you avoid peak hours, too.",

The course has clear deadlines, clear grading, he encourages collaboration, and he emphasizes on providing a real world like experience. It\u2019s a lot of work, but I\u2019ve never had so much fun working this hard.",

This means that there will be a mix of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and CS throughout the course. You\u2019ll have sections that will feel very natural to you based on your background with other sections that will challenge you since the course is designed to be multidisciplinary. The most successful students from my point of view were those that partnered with someone that had a complimentary background.",

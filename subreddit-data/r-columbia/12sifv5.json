If not, it gets a bit more cramped and complicated)\n\nReally all that matters to the department is that you take micro/macro/metrics by the end of junior year. You can double up micro/macro in the first semester to spread the electives out a bit more, take the seminar senior fall instead of spring. Basically every elective requires the two intermediate core courses, so keep that in mind.",

Otherwise you need permission from the department.\n\nIf you are doing the Econ major (i.e., not Financial Econ or one of the joint majors), one of your electives can be a 2000-level class, which has only an intro econ course as a prerequisite, so in theory (if doing Micro, Macro and Metrics isn't enough for you, ha!), you could do one elective in your first year.",

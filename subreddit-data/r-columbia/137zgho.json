    "postText": "Hi all :)\n\nI\u2019m on an F1 visa and was wondering if there was a way to rent an apartment without using a guarantor service. If I have a good credit score will that help? Or could I use one of my parents as a co-signer maybe if they\u2019re not a US resident?\n\nI honestly don\u2019t know what paperwork I would need to start the process of how to go about it so if anyone has any information at all, I would greatly appreciate it \u00a1",

Having a good credit score is pretty much given, on top of that you either need to make 40x+ the rent or if you have a guarantor, he / she has to make 80x+ the rent. Note that many apartments won\u2019t consider out-of-state guarantors. I\u2019d say your best shot is take the hit and use a third-party guarantor, which is quite common for a first rental for international students.",

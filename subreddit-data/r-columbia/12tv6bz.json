    "postText": "According to this year's common dataset, the SEAS combined plan accepted 226 students with a 82% acceptance rate and about 200 students enrolled. \n\nSince SEAS has about 1800 students and combined plan students take 2~2.5 years to graduate, does that mean more than 1/4 of SEAS students (450+) are from the combined plan?",

We\u2019re a decently high proportion, yes, but not that much.",

However I did not really like his teaching style as I felt he was just reciting kinda like from a textbook and when we asked questions he was not really able to clarify and just repeated the definitions.\n\nHowever i know it was his first semester teaching so he may have gotten a lot better!! He is definitely a really smart guy and wants to help you.",

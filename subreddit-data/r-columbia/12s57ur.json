    "postText": "Hello everyone! I am an incoming student to UT Austin and plan to transfer to Columbia for sophomore year. I wanted to ask which department is more suitable for me as I plan to major in econ/finance. I also wanted to ask if applying to general studies will boost my chances as I have taken a gap year and am eligible to apply. Thank you in advance!\n\nI am an international and have a 1490 SAT if that is important.",

Financial aid is much better in CC, so if money is at all a concern, it\u2019s a much better option",

I can\u2019t imagine how some people justify spending 60k a year on tuition at GS without aid and then getting told by their advisor to take out loans. The school is really a cash cow and there\u2019s a whole equality for GS movement going on. Unless you\u2019re a vet, GS is not worth it. UT might grant aid based on needs as well",

At some point in his first year, he decides that the school isn\u2019t right for him and he applies to transfer and gets admitted to USC for Fall 2001. John is a traditional student. John would have been eligible to apply to Columbia College.\n\nTransfer students can also be non-traditional:\nAna graduates high school in the class of 2000. However, she does not enroll to college. She, instead, chooses to travel the world for two years. Then, she comes back to America and joins the military for a four year term. After her service, she enrolls to her local community college for two years, then applies to four year universities in her second year to attain her bachelors degree. Ana can\u2019t apply to Columbia College, she has to apply to Columbia General Studies.\n\nTransfers can be non-traditional\u2014in which case they must apply to Columbia GS. However, they can also be traditional, in which case they *must* apply to Columbia College as GA does not enroll traditional students.\n\n\nOn the transfer page I linked, which I\u2019m unsure if you\u2019ve read, Columbia states this:\n\n\u201cColumbia College transfer applicants who have taken a break in their education of more than a full year (for any reason other than required completion of national military service), or who wish to attend school part time, should consider applying instead to Columbia University\u2019s School of General Studies. \n\nColumbia Engineering transfer applicants should proceed with this transfer application, regardless of any break in schooling.\u201d\n\nReading this, it is clear that transfer students are not limited to GS. Transfer students can apply and be admitted to any of the colleges\u2014it is just that non-traditional transfers should apply to GS instead of the College.",

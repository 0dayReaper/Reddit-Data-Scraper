    "postText": "Hi I was recently accepted into Columbias DBMI department and on their website it says that they provide no funding to their students. However, I have heard of students working as research assistants despite the website saying that they don't provide those. Is the website outdated, or are the opportunities are 'hidden'? Is there really no funding for Masters students, maybe through an R01?",

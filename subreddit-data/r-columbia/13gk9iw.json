    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman for GS and I am catching hell trying to register for classes.\n\nTo start, the Directory of Classes website (which looks like it was made in 1994) and Vergil are impossible to navigate. \nFor example, I tried looking for University Writing sections for Fall 2023. But when I search up that specific class on Vergil or the DOC, it says \"Sorry no classes available\". What does that even mean?\n\nAm I missing something? Is there another website? I completed the remote APS, but I'm still confused. I'm trying to get a schedule done before meeting my advisor but I truly don't know how to proceed",

If you're in CC, you'll also be placed in Lit Hum.\n\nSome things just can't be nailed down far in advance; this is one of them. Enjoy your summer and don't worry about what classes you'll be taking at what times in September. There will be time for that! And welcome to Columbia--I hope you have a great time here.",

Alas.\n\nRegistration will be a frustrating process for the entire four years at Columbia. Just be persistent. It is very common to go into the first week of classes and not have your schedule sorted yet. \n\nMany students over-register for more classes than they intend to take, in order to \u201cshop\u201d those classes the first week and choose which ones to actually continue (based on whether they like the professor, seeing the work load level or the syllabus, or whether they need to juggle timing in order to accommodate other classes). So don\u2019t panic if courses you want are \u201cfull\u201d and you\u2019re on the wait list. For large lecture courses, getting off the waitlist is pretty easy as long as you just show up during the first week. I never had a problem with that (caveat: for small seminars, it\u2019s less likely to get off the waitlist unless you are an upperclassman who needs the course for your major).\n\nFor your first semester, focus on registering for whatever intro sequence your major requires, a foreign language, University Writing once the sections populate and/or a couple large lecture courses that meet the science, Literature, or global core requirements (which tend to be plentiful and easy to get into). Some recommendations I\u2019d give include: Human Origins &amp; Evolution, Dinosaurs &amp; the History of Life, Shakespeare 1 or 2 at Barnard, or any of the entry level Astronomy courses.\n\nDon\u2019t worry about Art Hum and Music Hum as a freshman because those tend to be more competitive to get into a section for so people tend to do them later on.\n\nGS also has its own sections of LitHum and Contemporary Civilization, which are another good option for an incoming Freshman since those don\u2019t tend to be hard to get a seat in since not every GSer chooses to do them.\n\nBest of luck!",

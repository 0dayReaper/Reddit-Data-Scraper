    "postText": "Hey, so I recently completed the housing form and I put John Jay as my top option with Carmen being my second. I knew I wanted one of those two halls because of how social they both were, but eventually end up choosing John Jay because I didn't like the party atmosphere of Carmen as much. However, I still would like to have a roommate in one of the few doubles at John Jay. How can I best get one?",

I also wanted a JJ double but got assigned a single, and there were multiple people begging to let me swap into their JJ double as soon as I asked. For context I also did not put a roommate preference.",

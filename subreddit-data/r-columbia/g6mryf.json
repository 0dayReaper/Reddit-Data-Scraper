    "postText": "I got into UoP and Columbia, but I\u2019m pretty torn. On one hand, UoP definitely has the prestige when it comes to online courses and rumor has it they use WebEx instead of zoom. On the other hand, Columbia has pretty decent name recognition but they I heard they changed everything to P/F when they went online which is concerning given I\u2019m looking for rigorous academics. Thoughts?",

In a recent study, 94% of strippers I tried to sleep with while stationed at Fort Hood were attending UoP. Additionally, when the New England Patriots defeated the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX guess where it was? Yup. UoP Stadium. The only thing I'm certain ever happened at Columbia's stadium is Robert Kraft getting a handy under the bleachers. \n\nAs for admissions; Columbia insists upon elitist barriers to entry, such as high academic performance and extra curricular involvement, while at the same time offering TOEFL waivers. All UoP wants is your money. And a passing score of 75 on the TOEFL (no waivers).\n\nThe WebEx vs Zoom debate; we are all familiar with WebEx not allowing you to automatically connect to audio when joining a meeting using TSP hybrid VoIP, even if you have the settings enabled. But did you know that you can hire a goat to appear on your Zoom call?\n\nI think the decision has been made for you: Cornell announced that they're dropping SAT/ACT requirements for admission. Go get your farming degree from America's State School.",

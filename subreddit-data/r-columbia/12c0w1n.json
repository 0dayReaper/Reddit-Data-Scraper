    "postText": "I am deciding between the 1.5 year Columbia MS in CS, the 1.5 year UCLA MS in CS, and the 1 year UCB MEng in EECS (graphics focus). I also got CMU's MS in SoftEng, but I doubt it's not as good.\n\nThings that I want to consider:\n\n* I am an international student, so having a 1.5-year program is better (summer internship/research) and Berkeley don't offer degree extensions to 1.5 years.\n* I heard the MEng program is less good compared to the MS?\n* Does Silicon Valley really offer better job opportunities?\n* Research opportunities &amp; PhD application. I have not decided if I am or am not going to try doing PhD, but I want to keep it as an option.\n\nCan anyone better inform me, or offer opinions?\n\nI will post this in all 3 school's sub, so it's okay to be biased towards your school.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/12c0w1n)",

Personally I'd go to UCLA if you really want a pure tech experience. Weather is nice, grad people are talented, and start up culture is fun and stressful there. Pretty sure Berkeley requires a research project as part of EECS right? I feel like CMU is introverted and stressful whereas the other schools are a lot larger with more networking opportunities.",

Columbia's most common employer for new graduates is google, and for resume value for tech companies it is probably above UCLA. You have more access to finance companies in NY than the west coast does, but most students still end up working in Tech.\n\nStill would take CMU unless the software engineering over CS doesn't match your interests.",

There's a mix of theory and application in the Data Science program. I mentioned finance because a lot of people here come from banking, finance, and analyst backgrounds, so your networking might consist more of that. But you can totally be a tech person and thrive at Columbia. I just think it's better to be in Cali where you're in the center and the network doesn't have large variability. One of things I'd do is try to get in contact with current students over LinkedIn and see which program is more up your alley!",

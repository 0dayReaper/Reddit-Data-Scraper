I\u2019m also their oldest daughter &amp; I think being the first sibling to leave my state played a big role. \n\nI grew up in the South and a lot of people have misconceptions about NYC because they\u2019ve never been and all they know is what they\u2019ve seen on TV (which was often fox news). \n\nShowing your parents campus tours on YouTube can help ease their anxiety, along with having them engage in events. While my parents and I still don\u2019t necessarily see eye to eye on Columbia (my mom still wants me back in North Carolina), they do admit that attending Columbia has benefited me &amp; that I\u2019ve grown as a person by attending grad school here.",

However, Morningside Heights is a bubble and so if you really were afraid you could just stay near campus and have a fill of restaurants, grocery stores, etc. The most important thing is to not go to certain areas, on foot at least, once its like proper night time. My best tip for the subway is to make friends with a local student you'll hopefully meet during your time here and have them educate you on the nuances of subway travel. Or watch the various videos online on the subject. You'll be safe generally so long as you keep your wits about you and don't draw attention to yourself. \n\nYour parents are scared and ita reasonable to somr extent. But college is one of the few times you'll ever be able to genuinely live somewhere in the U.S. you've never been and adapt to new challenges. Just accept.",

Even at like 2 am on weekends, subway cars have plenty of people so you\u2019re never alone.\n\n around columbia, there\u2019s public safety officers on every street corner who work very close to, if not 24/7 (ive never not seen them, but im not much of a night owl so take that as you will) every dorm you need to swipe into with your card to enter the front door, then you go to the security guard\u2019s desk and swipe again. they\u2019re very well protected.",

For sure you should always be cautious of your surroundings, especially once it is late at night. However, if you ever stay too late at the library after dark, you can always take a Via back to your dorm which is free for Columbia students. I feel like walking around back home in LA is scarier than it is here because you rarely see people walking since everyone uses a car lol. \n\nIt is also worth noting that as a freshman, you will be directly on campus. There are always people at night on campus and you also won't have to walk off campus to get to your dorm. Anywhere you go has the potential to be unsafe, including UCLA. Just be cautious and weary of your surroundings.",

Sure at the end of the day Columbia is more prestigious and (depending on what your career goals are) may afford u more opportunities to get ur foot in the door. BUT, the academic quality at either institution is comparable. \n\nBut another big consideration would be the student experience\u2026 and to be honest, UCLA would be significantly more fun that Columbia. You get all the perks of being in a large state uni for undergrad and a much more traditional college experience. If I had to choose between the two for undergrad, I would do ucla in a heartbeat.\n\nBut to address OP\u2019s concern: safety is not generally an issue. Of course,that doesn\u2019t mean u should just go to any place u want at 2 am. There are also some neighborhoods and places u would want to steer clear of (but there\u2019s no reason u would need to go there anyways and around campus is actually pretty safe). But in general, so long as u are aware of ur surroundings when taking the metro or walking around late at night, u should be fine.",

Now, getting rolled up by the Electric Eliminators used to seem unlikely, but they\u2019ve been moving north from SoHo for a while and have been putting pressure on the northern Manhattan gangs. The Lizzie\u2019s are also a possibility - they\u2019re a smaller outfit, but they roll hard. Personally, my money\u2019s on the C.H.U.D\u2019s being the ones to get you, but so long as you steer clear of open sewers you should be fine.\n\nEdit: You\u2019ll be fine. NYC is a very safe place compared to other major cities.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming CS PhD trying to figure out housing. I have an odd situation where my lab is not on-campus but in lower manhattan, so I have to decide where I should prioritize being closer to. What would help me make this decision is knowing how often I expect to be on campus.\n\nHow often are you on campus for classes? Sort of on a different tangent but, are there any classes that you can reasonably do well in without going to lecture that count for the PhD? Any tips on optimizing schedule and which classes to take or not take? I\u2019m not a morning person at all and prefer to start my day at noon \ud83d\ude25\n\nI appreciate the help and advice!",

Moreover, you can always take express train and you can get from campus to Wall Street in under 30 minutes. \n\nYou can take comp exams to opt out of taking classes. Not all professors offer this option, but you can always ask. \n\nAlso, you need to take at most 10 classes, which means that most of your PhD is not going to be class work.",

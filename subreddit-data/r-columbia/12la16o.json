    "postText": "I\u2019m not keen to buy a graduation gown mainly for sustainability reasons and was wondering whether anyone here would be willing to set up an exchange. I live on UWS and would be happy to do a deposit-return, or simply buy it from you and pass it on again. Edit: I'm a Graduate Student. \n\nDrop me a message if interested! I know others who would love to do something like this so if there\u2019s much response I\u2019ll try to arrange that.",

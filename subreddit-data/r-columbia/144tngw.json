    "postText": "hello! incoming fall 2023 engineering masters student :) im currently in the waiting game after applying for grad housing, which from what i can tell is cheaper and more convenient than finding off campus housing. (correct me if i\u2019m wrong). how likely is it i\u2019ll receive an assignment? i applied back in april\u2026\n\nalso, i have a close friend (not columbia student) that would like to live with me in either murray hill or soho or west village. other than the price jump, is this 40 minute commute doable? i love these areas of the city but with courses being so far away im questioning if it\u2019s worth it to be in an ideal neighborhood with a hefty commute. should i wait longer to hear back from grad housing (which is not guaranteed, where i\u2019d live with a random student, in a less desirable but closer-to-campus area) or start looking elsewhere?",

    "postText": "Was wondering if other Grad School of journalism students received housing yet through the Columbia housing lottery? Still haven\u2019t heard anything yet from the housing portal yet for me. I imagine we will be notified in the 1st if May according to the timeline. I\u2019m getting a little worried as other Graduate school classmates from other departments appear to be receiving their approvals.",

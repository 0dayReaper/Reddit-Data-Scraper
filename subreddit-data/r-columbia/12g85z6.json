    "postText": "Hello! I got accepeted to Columbia College's class of 2027! I'm very excited to attend in the fall. On that note, my family is against me dorming due to cultural reasons and since I live only an hour away from campus. Do you guys think this is a good idea? Would I be missing out on special opportunities and would it affect my schooling? Also, would I be able to dorm later if I didn't dorm freshman year? Thank you for reading!!",

A big part of the social life in CC and SEAS comes from the residence halls, especially during first year when folks are first making friends and connecting. I don't want to assume what your parents' objections are, but there are single-sex floors in some of the first-year halls",

You\u2019d spend 2+ hours a day in transit, not to mention the hassle of needing a place to hang between classes. If you or your parents are looking for roommates or a living situation that\u2019s culturally similar to what you have now, Columbia is a big school with a diverse student body. Try to find a group that works for you.",

Either way, it's better to live on campus. You'll miss out on a lot of extracurricular opportunities and chances to form friendships if you commute as a freshman. Also, an hour is still a pretty long commute\n\nhttps://www.housing.columbia.edu/content/housing-first-year-students",

    "postText": "Hello everyone! I am working in NYC this summer and am looking for a room in an apartment anywhere in Lower East Side, Little Italy, or anywhere Brooklyn, preferably around Crown Heights if possible. Budget is around 1,100-1,300 but I am flexible! This would be for June through August. I am doing an internship on urban farming this summer and love to hike/take strolls : ) I am queer, non-binary, and love to bake, pet-sit, and have drinks with friends! Please let me know if you are interested/have something available",

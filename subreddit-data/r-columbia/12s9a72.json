    "postText": "so i\u2019m starting at columbia this fall and wanted to know if any of you recommend preparing somehow in for the core in any way to maybe get a head start? \ud83d\ude05 I know it sounds pretty unusual but maybe there are books I can start reading that are required etc\u2026. or maybe someone can even PM examples of material from certain required classes\u2026. I just thought i\u2019d get mentally prepared, i feel like i won\u2019t fully understand the core until I have tangible examples",

            "comment": "Biggest tip: Shop around during the shopping period. For Core classes, some professors are really hardcore (multiple sit down exams, essays, weekly discussion posts), and some are really lenient (one essay per semester). The trick is to try out a bunch of classes to find a professor who is chill and works with your schedule. For LitHum, I got a super nice, chill professor while my friends got some really tough professors.",

            "comment": "Read the first 6 books (chapters) of the Iliad. Annotate a very little bit (underline important quotes). Getting in the habit of that will help you when it comes time to write essays. Don\u2019t do anything else over the summer. You will not remember enough of what you read when you read the other books in class to make it worth your time. The actual work you do varies greatly across sections, but most of the time it\u2019s more time consuming than objectively hard.",

From personal experience, any preparation over the summer will lead to very little and just end up in you not doing a lot of work but not doing a lot of relaxation. Core classes are very doable and you will do great regardless :)",

            "comment": "I'd say start with the Iliad and the Odyssey cause those are like Columbia's pride and gem. we spend a lot of time on those. but in general, I wouldn't necessarily recommend reading in advance because you're gonna need to have the book fresh in your mind for class discussions and for essays so you'd have to end up rereading or skimming anyways. and you'll quickly learn how much you're gonna be using SparkNotes",

(You'll also realize that Columbia is HARD, so you won't be surprised as too many are when they are suddenly trying to balance their workload with their social life and the gym!)",

I actually did most of the readings last semester, but this term I've probably truly read like two books, and I feel bad cause they seem like good books. but it feels wasteful to spend hours reading a lithum book I'm gonna talk about for one day than to do actual tangible, and fruitful homework. then again, my section doesnt have discussion posts so that might be it",

I was fortunate enough to have studied (portions of) those classics before CU, and I was better prepared to employ critical thinking as an undergraduate than some of my classmates to whom the Iliad and the Odyssey were \"new\" when they hit the reality of campus academic obligations.",

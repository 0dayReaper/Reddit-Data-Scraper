    "postText": "~~I hope this is the correct subreddit for this. If not, please be kind and redirect me.~~\n\n~~So my sister (U.K. citizen) and her BF (Columbian citizen) came back for Christmas (bad decision, but they hadn\u2019t been back for three years and the only time they can is during school holidays). Their flight was booked with Aero Mexico, but they had to fly from London to Paris with Air France to catch a connecting flight.~~\n\n~~The thing is, at the Heathrow airport check-in desk they were told by Air France staff that they *are not allowed entry to Columbia*. They had to come all the way home, and the next day they called the Columbian embassy who told them Air France was wrong and they *should\u2019ve been allowed on the flight*. They then called Air France who refused to accept what the Columbian embassy said, and are sticking with their original refusal.~~\n\n~~So essentially they\u2019re stuck in the U.K., but both have jobs and responsibilities back in Columbia which may be in jeopardy. Can anyone perhaps offer some advice as to what they can do?~~\n\nEDIT: thanks to you kind people, I realised I hilariously posted in the WRONG subreddit. I feel tempted to just leave this here for laughs since it is actually quite a funny mistake. If the mods want to remove it please go ahead. Sorry everyone!",

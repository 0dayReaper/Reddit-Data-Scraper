    "postText": "Greetings, \n\nAs an incoming student at Columbia University, I've been diligently scouring various websites recommended by the university in search of suitable apartments. However, I've noticed that many of these listings come with the dreaded broker fees. I am seeking advice on how to navigate this issue and avoid these fees altogether. Your detailed explanations and insights would be immensely appreciated!\n\nI would be grateful if you could shed light on any strategies, tips, or alternative methods that can help prospective renters like me bypass broker fees. Perhaps there are specific websites, platforms, or resources that are broker-free? Or maybe there are certain timeframes or negotiation tactics that can lead to fee-free rental arrangements? Any firsthand experiences or knowledge in this area would be incredibly valuable.\n\nThank you all in advance for your time and assistance.",

I learned during my apt search last year that a listing with a brokers fee usually means the monthly rate will be lower, when compared to similar apts in the same category/neighborhood. It was explained to me that no-fee apts charge the tenant a couple hundred more a month by the landlord, instead of paying a broker. Bc you pay the broker fee once, if you were to re-sign the same apartment for an additional year, it usually works out to be a lower amount paid over the 24 months, 36 months, or more, when compared to a no-broker fee apt. So, you should really figure out your plans and find places/rates and do the math. I personally could not stomach paying someone 7k+ for just answering my text messages and phone calls. A lot of brokers are PoS, but not all. The fact that 50% of the apts in Manhattan do not have a brokers fee anymore (and rising), means you should diligently search for apts that don\u2019t charge them.",

Lots of brokers work with landlords directly.",

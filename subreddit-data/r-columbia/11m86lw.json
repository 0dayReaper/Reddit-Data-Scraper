            "comment": "**For Graduate Students** \n\nIf you are in a \"funded\" graduate program for a PhD you will be guaranteed housing in University Apartment Housing (UAH). These are apartments owned by the university, with Columbia being your landlord and to whom you pay rent. You can choose to live in these or not. But a space is reserved for you until you indicate otherwise.\n\nIf you're in an unfunded program, like a Master's degree, you have the option to rent UAH. Difference being the University does not guarantee that there will be space available to you. However, there is usually a good amount of options available.\n\nIf you're single, regardless of being a PhD or Master's student, you're very unlikely to be given a one bedroom or studio to rent. You will most likely be offered a 2-4 bedroom apartment which you'll share with other graduate students. Exceptions are made for those with disabilities. \n\nYour ability to \"shop around\" UAH apartments is extremely limited. You will be given access to a portal which lists the apartments available to you. This includes information like square footage, price, address, floorplan, and sometimes photos. However, don't expect to be able to preview it in-person as it will likely be occupied until a few days before you move in.\n\n**For School of General Studies** \n\nNote that \"GS Student Housing\" isn't actually a thing, per say. That is, there are no dedicated university apartments for GSers (unless something has changed recently) There are two flavors of University supplied housing that GS has access to: \n\n1. University Apartment Housing (UAH) This is first allocated to graduate students. If there are UAH units available after the PhDs and Masters students take residence, the remaining units will go to GSers. There tends to be a healthy wait list for these.\n\n2. Communal Housing is what I'll call the second type. These aren't dorms as you might imagine. More like barracks. Think studio apartments with a private toilet, but shared cooking, shower, and laundry facilities. Residents include GSers, international students, and some graduate students or visiting scholars. \n\nUAH is by far the better deal, if you can get it. The buildings, while tending to be old, are well maintained and the facilities crews are usually pretty responsive.",

I am a female grad student at Columbia and I will be away for the summer. The place is on W 115th St and just across the Morningside heights campus (Amsterdam Ave). The available dates for sublet is from May 13 to Aug 15. The apartment is fully furnished with bed, desk, mirror, storage spaces, kitchen, spacious living room, and washers and dryers (in-basement, $2.25 per session). I\u2019m flexible with dates but prefer the person willing to take close to or the entire period. Monthly rent is $1500, and the refundable security deposit is $800. You\u2019ll have a female roommate who goes to Columbia\u2019s GSAPP. We hope you are a clean, respectful person. \n\nPlease DM and leave a comment below if interested!",

If anyone is moving out and is willing to share some details about their current place either to say it's nice or to warm me away, please DM this account!

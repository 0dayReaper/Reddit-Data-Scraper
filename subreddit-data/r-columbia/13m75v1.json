    "postText": "Hi people! \n\nI'm a new transfer student to Columbia and am interested in linguistics. I just googled Columbia's linguistics undergrad program and found the result quite upsetting. Linguistics is my side hobby and the major I applied to is not linguistics, so I haven't done any research about Columbia's ling program before, and now it seems like we don't even have a linguistics department here :/ Can't believe I'll spend the rest of my undergrad without linguistics \ud83d\ude2d (disclaimer: I know we DO have a decent amount of linguistics classes and some really interest me but still feel kinda sad)\n\nCan my fellow ling enthusiasts tell me more about the linguistics dept here? How's your experience here? Also looking forward to knowing something about classes and profs! thx :0",

In the last ten years or so, there has been a lot of undergrad interest in linguistics, which resulted in the creation of the special concentration in linguistics and then, just a couple of years ago, the major. (A special concentration is a program of study that hasn't been approved by the State of New York as a degree-bearing program; the fact that the College was able to create a New York-approved major without having a department is an achievement--it means they were able to offer a critical mass of courses across a fairly broad range of topics.) The community of students interested in linguistics is quite passionate.",

Anyway thanks to previous students we finally return to this point. Can\u2019t believe years ago student in this IVY LEAGUE can\u2019t even major in linguistics lol. This is the best of the time so far",

The course catalogue is free online and you can search by key words. \n\nAlso I know many people in CC and BC who majored or concentrated in linguistics by creating their own major.\n\nEdit: if you speak Spanish the sociolinguistic aspects of US Spanish is a great course.",

    "postText": "Anyone looking for a room for the summer? The person who was going to sublease it had a sudden change of plans. It\u2019s on 114th, behind Butler, for $1500 (utilities included). The room is being renovated, but will have a new bed. I have an amazing desk, monitor, and chair that you can use and a sofa. The other person living here will be a rower. Construction will be going on in the lower levels, and potentially minor work in the apartment itself, but the workers will be gone after work hours. Move in date is June 1st.",

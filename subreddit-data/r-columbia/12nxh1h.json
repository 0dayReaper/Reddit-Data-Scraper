I would be interning this summer from May 15 to Aug 4 and am looking for furnished housing (and roommates) in Manhattan (preferably near the Chelsea area) or west Brooklyn. I don\u2019t mind staying a bit far as long as I can commute in under 30-35 mins. Please contact me if you have anything available.",

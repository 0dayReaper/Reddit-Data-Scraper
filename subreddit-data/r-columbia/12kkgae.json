    "postText": "Hi, I'm an admitted student CO'27. I know Columbia has kinda crappy mental health services, but I'm more concerned about how open or tolerant they are towards students with OCD and ADHD. My grades are dipping because of my mental health despite working harder than ever, and I might lose 5-6 IB points for my final IB exams. I'm wondering how Columbia would take the mental health explanation if they ever give me a warning letter. Would having mental health as a reason (\"excuse\") actually be a bigger incentive for them to rescind me? Because I've heard stories of a Yale student getting kicked out or something because the school didn't want mentally ill students. \n\nHow about in the college itself, once you're a student? Are professors or the administration tolerant of deadline extensions or other accommodation for mental health? Thanks.",

Legally they\u2019re required to provide reasonable accommodations, although professors and admin sometimes aren\u2019t aware of that (that\u2019s why you want to register with the disability services office.)",

In my experience, it was a frustrating and difficult process, and you need to work with your case worker to advocate for yourself. \n\nTalk to your mental health provider to get a letter discussing what accomodations you'll need, too.",

Also, my advisor has been incredibly supportive and helpful. I had the similar concerns before joining, but I am happy I did.",

They often provide learning specialists you can meet with every other week for ADHD/autism/etc. And you can get deadline accommodations for many programs.\n\nLots of people at Columbia have poor mental health. There's a stress culture around here, and it's very competitive, and people have high expectations.\n\nThat being said, it's certainly doable provided that you are proactive and advocate for yourself. Also, join some of the on-campus disability affinity spaces like Spoons at Multicultural Affairs. I would recommend Neurodivergent at Columbia, too.",

I tried reaching out to the professor inquiring for the grade breakdown last week but they haven\u2019t responded yet and it\u2019s been 5 days since. \n\nWould love to know if there\u2019s a process to petition and would love to hear from those who have done this before. Thank you.",

I still completed the painting project that was done during that week.\n\nI did all assignments and everything.\n\nDo you have any experience/knowledge on how to petition the grade under the arts department? I have photographs of all the painting projects I did and I have shown significant progress.",

The professor may eventually respond to your original email; it's a very busy time right now.\n\nIf the prof doesn't think they mis-graded you, but you still believe there was some actual inequity involved, the next step would be to contact the head of the Visual Arts Department. This is unlikely to result in a grade change, but you might get some closure.\n\nOnly in the case of the most gross professorial malfeasance (the professor lowered your grade because you wouldn't do a personal favor for them, or they penalized you for some aspect of your identity, e.g.) would there be any reason to go beyond this.\n\nThe likelihood that someone in authority will actually step in and force a professor to change a grade is pretty close to zero, but you may feel it's important to have the conversations about it.",

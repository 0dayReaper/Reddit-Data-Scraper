            "comment": "And yet this is one hundred percent the responsible thing to do not just for the sake of the Columbia community, but, more importantly, for Harlem and the city in general. Even if Columbia could have pulled off the insane feat of quarantining everyone for two weeks, they would still be adding to the density of the neighborhood and ensuring a massive increase in the severity of an outbreak if it were to occur. Now, Harlem residents can move forward with the peace of mind in knowing that, at least for the time being, a bunch of college kids won't be invading their community and bringing their germs along with them.\n\nPeople who are responding to this news with disappointment, rather than relief, are being egotistical and unrealistic, and are representations of the predatory and irresponsible approach which Columbia takes toward its neighbors. We live in a world that is unrecognizable from that which we lived in at the start of last school year. Just because you want that not to be the case, doesn't mean anything. I hope that everyone here takes this to heart. And I don't want to hear any bullshit about how it is still justified to express disappointment. It's not, because Covid is the overarching determinant of our reality right now, and just because Columbia led y'all on to believe this would be safe and responsible, doesn't mean it ever was going to be, and y'all should have recognized that and been opposed to this plan to begin with, rather than putting undue pressure on the university to open up so y'all can have your stupid little college experiences in the midst of a fucking pandemic.",

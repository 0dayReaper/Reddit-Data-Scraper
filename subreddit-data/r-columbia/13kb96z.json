I have the units / space, but I wanted to know if it\u2019s feasible to completely start this major as a rising junior? \n\nI\u2019ve not taken intro to urban studies, etc or anything yet and I know there\u2019s a junior seminar which has me a little worried since I\u2019m just starting (but I do have some other requirements fulfilled through classes I\u2019ve taken that coincidentally fulfill certain urban studies requirements)",

I\u2019ve heard opposing views and I am really confused.. is it prestigious? Will I be able to have a traditional experience just like CC students have?",

I can't speak to prestige outside columbia (but my guess is that it's the same since no one knows or cares that columbia has 4 ugrad colleges)but no one that matters will look down on you here. Experience should be entirely the same afaik though without the living in freshman dorms?",

            "comment": "Idk about deferring your admission, but you can definitely take a gap year during your time working towards your degree. I did it and it was fine. But if you don\u2019t register for classes for more than one year (iirc, don\u2019t take my word for it, look it up) you have to reapply as a Returning Student because you\u2019re considered to have dropped out and will have to explain what you spent the gap doing.\n\nGS is designed for nontraditional students, so they\u2019re a lot more flexible with GSers in general than the CC/SEAS students. Eg we can take classes part time.\n\nDon\u2019t worry about the \u201cprestige\u201d stuff. GS is the same experience, same education, and you\u2019re as integrated as you want to be (or don\u2019t want to be). A bunch of GSers are even traditional aged because the dual-degree programs with other universities are technically housed under GS. A lot of GSers get a complex about whether GS is perceived differently but all the outside world sees is that you attended Columbia University and received an Ivy League education after being admitted through a competitive and selective process. The rest is up to you to make yourself more than just the name on your piece of paper, and being at GS gives you access to all the same opportunities to do just that.",

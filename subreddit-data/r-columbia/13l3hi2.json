I\u2019m thinking something in the library? Can I also apply for reading and argument coach? What are my best options for on-campus employment?\n\nPs- Joining MS Journalism, not eligible for CCE services :(",

I believe a lot of 'jobs' are first allocated to work-study students - but you won't be able to get those (because obv the government paying half their salary makes them cheaper). So I'd just apply for whatever you can apply for. A lot of jobs in my experience are also very 'network-y', so you know the professor or something like that.",

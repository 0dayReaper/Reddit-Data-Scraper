What are my chances of getting off the waitlist and securing any on campus housing? Or should I just start looking for off campus housing even though I\u2019ll be pretty late to the game.",

I am married and moving across the country so I might have had fewer options to pick from than someone who was single and open to roommates. What Columbia was able to offer me was very limited. \n\nThe process has been rather opaque but it seems like housing is tight from my very limited experience.",

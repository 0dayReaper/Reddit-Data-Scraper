Was thinking if I could take some Law-oriented courses, then perhaps I could get a better understanding of what law is like. Anyone have course recommendations? Very open-minded here! (Also, does columbia have anything like a lawyer alumni mentoring program or something similar? How can I connect with law professionals through Columbia?). Thanks!",

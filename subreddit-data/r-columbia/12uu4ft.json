    "postText": "Hi, I am a sophomore, and this is my first summer session at Columbia. I was wondering if it is feasible to take programming class and stats class at the same time for a summer session. I am thinking of taking intro to Java and Calc based stats. I have no background on programming, but I took intro statistics class before. What do you think?",

            "comment": "Calc based stats should not be hard if you have experience. The workload isn't super high either. Java will be a *lot* of programming in a very short time frame. If you end up not being comfortable with coding or fall behind, that workload might be a pain. If you end up grasping the material somewhat quickly, it's more doable.",

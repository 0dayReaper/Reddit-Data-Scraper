From the facade of the building it looks like at least one room gets a window! Pls help!! Anyone around the street, hit me up? Really need a few pictures of the place",

            "comment": "It is required by law for a room to be considered a bedroom in NY, that there be two ways to exit the room. One of those is typically a window (the other is your standard door).\n\nI don't know anything about that particular building, but most are weird L or T shapes that give each apartment some windows, but aren't street-facing. You will prefer not street-facing, especially on 112th when you're going to hear sirens the whole f***ing night, anyways.",

    "postText": "I just got accepted to Columbia College as a rising Sophomore 23 Fall.\n\nOn the website it says: \"Columbia admits transfer students on a need blind basis. However, Columbia has a limited amount of institutional funds for transfer students. In order to be considered for financial aid transfer applicants must have a complete financial aid application on file at the time of their admission.\"\n\nDoes that mean I won't be able to apply for aid all three years or just my sophomore year? I was wondering if a change in financial position in the future would impact my ability to pay tuition",

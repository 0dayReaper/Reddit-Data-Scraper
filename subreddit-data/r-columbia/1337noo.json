            "comment": "Yeah the ones with tons of dresses are rich. If you see a formal coming down the line, hit up Century 21 or any of the listed above. They're reopening in May! As for semi formal/going out find \"your\" black (black, navy, whatever) and get a dress or two in that color. Something neutral, sleek, and not overly trendy. Go nuts with accessories. It's a myth that people will notice a repeated dress. \n\nI have the benefit of having lived here for a while before attending, but it's a good bet for surviving New York. I have two-three black dresses I feel good in and can be dressed up for fancy dinner, look cute for something more low-key and are modest enough for work events/school awards dinners etc. Bring one such dress with you and find another when you're more comfortable with shopping here. Don't go out and buy a bunch. Your $8 cowl dress with enough rouching to allow weight fluctuation and still look cute will find you.",

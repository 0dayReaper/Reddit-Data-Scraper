            "comment": "I\u2019m living in Carlton right now, it\u2019s basically the farthest dorm from campus so you\u2019ll have to factor that into walking to class every morning/getting food which for me has been really annoying because if I\u2019m hungry I don\u2019t wanna do a fifteen minute walk to get to the dining hall I wanna go to. Same with the mail center, I haven\u2019t been ordering like anything because undergrads pick up mail in Wien, and that\u2019s just a really annoying walk carrying a heavy package. Also, Carlton is like right next to a highway and the river, so the helicopter sounds, car sounds, etc are worse there than in any other dorm I\u2019ve lived in. For my suite all of the girls have to share one shower and I\u2019m pretty sure Wien has multiple showers in each gender\u2019s bathroom so you\u2019ll be less likely to have to deal with the annoyance of wanting to take a shower but not being able to. Wien is right next to Faculty House which is one of the fancier dining hall options so that\u2019s a plus. Also Wien rooms all have sinks in them, which I\u2019ve heard can be bad if it clogs, but if it\u2019s working well then it\u2019s nice to not have to leave the room to brush your teeth or something. Wien lounges are kinda off to the side of the floor and it has a door so you can have some privacy and Carlton the lounge is just like at the entrance of the suite so anyone using the restroom or coming in or leaving will walk past you and that can be kinda annoying.",

            "comment": "Current 3-2 student here, living in Carlton. Firstly, the area is safe. It\u2019s right off of Broadway, so your walk home will basically always be well-lit and near other people; I\u2019m much more scared of running into rats than running into any shady characters. Wien is essentially on-campus, so the same applies there. \n\nI don\u2019t know much about facilities in Wien, but every Carlton suite has 2 bathrooms for 8-14 people. One bathroom (for one gender) has 1 stall 2 showers; the other vice versa. Honestly has been much less of an issue than I\u2019d thought it would be, and if I really can\u2019t hold it I\u2019ll just go to another suite. I\u2019m in a double (applied for a single, but they\u2019re very hard to come by) and though I got unluckily put in one of the smaller ones, some of the doubles here are pretty massive compared to doubles I\u2019ve had in the past.\n\nYes, the commute is around 10-15 minutes walk, especially considering that the engineering building is on the NE corner of campus (while Carlton is SW of campus). It\u2019s annoying but you learn to work around it and to minimize the trips back and forth you have to make. Biggest other negative is the sensitive fire alarms, meaning you might have to evacuate due to idiots not knowing how to cook more often than in other buildings.\n\nHonestly, though, I do really like the suite style. They try to make specific floors (this year, floors 8&amp;3) &amp; suites specifically for 3-2 students, which can be super helpful when trying to make friends. I have a couple real close friends I\u2019ve made here because they\u2019re my suite mates. Wien is just a long hallway with a common room at one end.\n\nTL;DR If you hate walking and your backpack will be super heavy, pick Wien. If you want to have a little bit easier time making friends, pick Carlton. \n\nFeel free to message me if you have any other 3-2 questions!",

In my opinion, MechE is the hardest major (I have a lot of friends in ME and as a CivE have had to take a few classes with them). It\u2019ll be an adjustment bc not only is it 5 classes, but 5 STEM classes. If you can manage your time well (personally, I have spent so much more time in the library this year than I ever did at my old school), I think you can make the adjustment.",

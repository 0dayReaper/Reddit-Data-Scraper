Extremely content heavy lecture course and the seminar he leads has been the saving Grace for me to keep my head above water. On top of that, as a regular in office hours it was nice to se he really seemed to genuinely care about making sure I understood things. Never made me feel like I was encroaching on his time and made himself as accessible as he could be. In short, he went above and beyond what I am guessing is expected of TAs given my past experiences (and that is not a knock to other TAs per se, but more of a nod to his talents and work ethic).",

You know what you do when you actually feel threatened by someone? You know like those homeless people who are crazy on the subway? You completely ignore them or you run away.\n\nAlso that's campus liberals literally cause riots when center-right people like ben shapiro or mike cernovich come to talk at a campus, right? Very tolerant.",

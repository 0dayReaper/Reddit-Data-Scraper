I know, you\u2019ll probably come with all sorts of colorful ideas as to how the clubs are awesome, or how the events bring us together or even how the classes are engaging. But that does not equate to genuine care. As a matter of fact, I doubt you genuinely care for any of those you call friends.\n\nIt takes a while for you to be savvy enough to understand when everybody\u2019s smile are hollow.",

I can't find any evaluations on Vergil, but it looks like this is more like a seminar class with few students. How is the instructor and how much courseload should I expect?\n\nI would also appreciate it if you can give me some suggestions on similar classes that deal with sociology, epidemiology, and public health (other than intro to public health).",

I imagine most people will have good seats because it\u2019s much smaller than commencement, but I figured I\u2019d double check. If they arrive just before the ceremony, will they be able to sit somewhere where they can actually see me walk across the stage?",

Also be prepared to sit through literally 3+ hours of name reading and people walking. And tbh the stage is probably only really visible to the graduates anyway -- the stage and grad seating was in the middle lawn in front of Butler while guests were in separate tents on the side lawns with screens set up to watch.",

            "comment": "There is one public health class that counts toward the science requirement, **FSPH UN1100, Food, Public Health &amp; Public Policy**, but note: **it does not count as a natural science.** So if you are a regular CC student (not a transfer--see below for rules for transfers) and you have already partially fulfilled the science requirement with a \"quantitative\" course (math, stats or comp sci course or Symbolic Logic, etc.), you can't complete it with FSPH UN1100.\n\nYou can find a list of courses for non-STEM majors that fulfill the science requirement [here](https://bulletin.columbia.edu/columbia-college/core-curriculum/science-requirement/).\n\n***Be careful:*** \n\n* **Barnard courses do not count toward the science requirement**, except for a couple of astronomy courses specifically listed on the Core Curriculum/Science Requirement/Courses for Non-Majors page in the Columbia College Bulletin.\n* **You must take at least one \"natural science\" course.** This is defined as a course in one of these departments: Astronomy, Biological sciences, Chemistry, Earth and Environmental Science, E3B (Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology), Physics, Psychology.\n* ***Not every psychology course counts toward the science requirement:*** obviously Barnard psych classes don't count, but neither do courses with numbers in the 2600s, which are considered to be social science rather than STEM. When in doubt, check with your advisor!\n* **Transfer students need to take at least one of their science requirement courses at Columbia, and one of their courses (whether from their original institution or CC) must be a natural science. They do not need to take FroSci.**",

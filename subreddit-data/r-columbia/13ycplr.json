    "postText": "There is nothing clear on the website as to how this degree program actually works. Is it the same as doing rabbinical school and college simultaneously, or would I still have to go to rabbinical school on top of the program? If the second thing is true, what would be the actual fastest way to become a Rabbi? (Saying this as someone who will soon be applying to colleges)",

However I would be willing to bet that is an exceptional circumstance (He is a very talented rabbi).\n\nThat all being said the joint program will probably put you ahead of your peers in your rabbinical school classes, which are definitely not easy. Being a rabbi takes a lot of work, it's not really something you should/can rush.",

Of course this is a Columbia subreddit so I'll tell you that Columbia/JTS is a great option if you want to become a rabbi. From my observations though a majority of the JTS rabbinical school students tend to come from an Ivy, a NESCAC or Brandeis.",

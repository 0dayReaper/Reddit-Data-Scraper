The subway is not unsafe at 8pm. I cannot comment on the path, but you know, stay alert, be aware of what\u2019s going on around you and when in doubt, find a subway car that\u2019s more packed than empty. \n3. If you have classes 4 days a week, and want to fun stuff you can do the monthly subway pass which is about $130 but does not cover the path. The path is additional on top of that. \n\nIMO if you\u2019re going to spend $200 each month commuting just add that to your rent instead and live closer to campus.",

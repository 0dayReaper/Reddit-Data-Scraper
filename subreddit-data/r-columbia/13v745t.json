I got a notif right after saying I was declined specifically for that reason from the admins, and have requested to join a number of times after rectifying this mistake, to no avail or communication. Anyone in this group that can comment on what I can do to (it's so silly that this is in reference to an FB group that's being gatekept) improve my application? The current lack of socializing resources for grad students is alarming, and I'm trying to leverage any non-sketch resource that comes my way.",

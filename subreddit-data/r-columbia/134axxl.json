For most people it's probably metrics since it's very different from all the classes before it and receives the most complaints about instruction quality. If you've coded before and/or are comfortable with stats, it's not that bad though. Micro is the most math heavy, especially if you have someone like Dean (good, but very rigorous). Macro is less math heavy, but often less intuitive.",

He's applies his charisma and light hearted nature to make the potentially very dry and boring subject matter engaging and palatable.   ... Maybe even fun.  \nHis assignments take time and thought, but aren't tricky or difficult unless you over think or get hung up on some R code .   \nI'd take another course with him in a heartbeat. Highly recommend.",

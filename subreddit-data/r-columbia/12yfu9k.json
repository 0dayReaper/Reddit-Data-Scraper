I got a D in 2020 even though my professor was reassuring that I wouldn\u2019t get a D as my final grade when I discussed with him that I wanted to drop the class if I was going to get a D or F. Now, I\u2019m in the same class because it\u2019s a major requirement and a D won\u2019t count towards major requirements, and I\u2019ll be getting a better grade this semester than in 2020. Is there a way to petition to have the D from 2020 removed and replaced by my new grade?",

You can try talking to an advisor, but I don\u2019t think your argument that your professor said you wouldn\u2019t get a D almost 3 years ago will be looked particularly favorably. You\u2019ll get credit for passing it for major requirements, but you can\u2019t remove it from your transcript or GPA. Relevant policy below:\n\n\u201cFor repeated courses, only the grade earned for the first attempt will be calculated into the grade point average. In cases where the first attempt was an F, both grades will be factored into the grade point average.\u201d",

You made a choice not to drop the class--it was your choice. You earned a D--for your work. That's not the end of the world, but it's hard to see a reason why your record should be retroactively changed.",

However, it was the first semester during the pandemic, my first semester at Columbia and I unfortunately had 5 family members pass away from the beginning of said semester to the end all independent from one another. It was a really difficult time and though I should have withdrawn, I didn\u2019t.",

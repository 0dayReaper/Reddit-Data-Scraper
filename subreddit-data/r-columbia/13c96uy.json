You will find as you age that the way you travel and what interests you changes, and it would be a shame to not enjoy it at multiple times in your life. If you're lucky, you'll travel for fun, adventure, exploration, work, love, and sometimes just for the hell of it.",

But it also gets harder to make time for it as you add more responsibilities to your life (especially kids). A great time to travel is when you and your partner are both settled in your career, but haven't had kids yet. In hindsight I do wish we'd traveled a bit more during that period of our lives. Try to knock out the types of trips that you'd enjoy less with a small kid tagging along (trips that involve serious amounts of hiking come to mind).",

(it did start having diminishing returns after the first few dozen countries, tbh.)\n\ni do wish i took more risks re: taking interesting courses instead of just trying to conserve my GPA, though. and i also wish i were more proactive about learning and getting better at various sports.",

I enjoy what I do but I can\u2019t help but feel I\u2019m wasting away the prime years of my life behind a desk 10 hours a day when I could be out exploring the world instead. And for what? That is by far the single biggest drawback in my line of work. And perhaps with school in general.",

            "comment": "Hard to objectively rank because it really depends on what you want. Carman thought to be the party dorm (and no singles!), Furnald quieter dorm, and John Jay somewhere in the middle. Obviously none of those things are written in stone, but it tends to be a self-fulfilling prophecy given the reputations. Don\u2019t know much about Wallach and Hartley honestly. Would rank JJ #1 if I were you. It has singles, a pretty solid vibe, and having two of the main dining halls in-house is great when the weather is bad.",

Really close to classes, and if you get a lawn-facing room, it's really quiet too (Not to mention the great view of campus on higher floors). If you're between Wallach and Hartley would def recommend Wallach as Hartley has not been renovated for a long time.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming grad student who will live on the 114th street which is super close to the dining halls. Considering a meal plan but wondering people\u2019s experiences.\n\nHeard there are plenty of food trucks around campus? Specifically how are the Asian foods and prices? I\u2019m a big fan of Asian food but wondering if one swipe at a dining hall is going to be cheaper sometimes (heard John Jay would have sushi on menu?)\n\nI love to cook but probably won\u2019t have time for all the grocery shopping, cooking and cleaning on a daily basis. Does it sound feasible if I typically get one bigger meal at one of the dining halls (or get 4 items from JJ\u2019s), one smaller from a food truck, and rely on easy home-made veggie soup for the third?\n\nI\u2019m pescatarian and love veggies and fruits. Not a big eater but would love a big breakfast to relieve anxiety. Food options I expect to get from dining halls on a regular basis are: protein (tofu, boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, omelette, seafoods), big portion of fruit salad, fresh juice, smoothies and froyo. Always down for Asian food. Would the dining halls constantly be able to offer these or is it cheaper &amp; easier to just get them from some cafe/cafeteria/supermarket outside?\n\nAlso I\u2019m thinking about swiping for friends\u2019 meals when they come visit just for the experience. \n\nConsidering my expectations, any chance I\u2019m going to end up wasting the swipes with a meal plan? Is the smallest meal plan worth the price? Heard it\u2019s ~16 per swipe but single-entry with credit card is 19? Is it possible to pay individually for items at JJ\u2019s?\n\nLots of questions lol. Thanks!",

For Asian food specifically though (also a huge Asian food fan) there are very few options and those they have aren\u2019t the best. Honestly the best Asian food they provide is from cafe East which isn\u2019t on the dining plan. I\u2019d recommend eating out around campus as it\u2019s cheaper and you\u2019ll get more out of it than the $16(?) per swipe.",

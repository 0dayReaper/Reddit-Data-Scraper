I did have a heavily discounted plan through gs (I think like 60% off?), which is the only reason I got it. Pretty certain my opinions would not be the same if it wasn't for that, as the  actual plans are not cheap and I don't think it's worth the full price (equivalent to cooking a lot of your meals plus eating out often).",

            "comment": "I\u2019d say the two biggest factors to consider are how often you\u2019ll be on campus/where you live and the other being your aptitude for cooking. If you live close to campus and you find yourself on it often then I\u2019d say it is worth while purely because you\u2019re so close anyway. If you live an inconvenient distance from campus or aren\u2019t planning on being on campus often it might not be worth it. The other factor is if you like cooking and have the kitchen/equipment for it then you could probably feed yourself for cheaper than a dining plan. With that said my overall assessment of the dining halls are that they are a decent value, relative good quality, and most important for me is that I can swipe in, eat, and be out in about as fast as I can chew.",

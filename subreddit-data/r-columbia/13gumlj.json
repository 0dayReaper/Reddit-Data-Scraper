            "comment": "The summer of your freshman year, you can get a summer work exemption if you have an unpaid or low paid internship. You have to fill out an application to the CCE and it\u2019s selective but it\u2019s a good way to shave off some money and if you apply for funding then you can get additional money too. \n\nThere are loaner services for books for FGLI students and late into this past semester they started loaning out Apple laptops and chromebooks. Idk about the tech service as I\u2019m yet to use it, but the book program is very helpful because you get to borrow the class textbooks for the entire semester. Make sure you do this early especially for your core classes because demand is high for those books. If you have any other questions you can DM me :)",

As for general FLI things, the FLI Network here usually hosts a lot of events through the semester like the FLI Formal in addition to the upLIFT special interest community that hosts things like coat drives. You could also apply to live in the upLIFT SIC which would give you a guaranteed single (in a housing pool where that tends to be quite rare). Sign up for the FLI Network newsletter to get info on that and welcome!!",

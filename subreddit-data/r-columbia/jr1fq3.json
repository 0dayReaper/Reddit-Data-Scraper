Another section is available at this time. Press 1 to select it._\n\nAnd then you press 1, thinking \"at this time\" means it's a class scheduled for the same time as the full one, but it doesn't, and you find yourself in an 8:05am class on the other side of campus and they won't let you change it because they don't want people \"shopping\" for Core classes.\n\nApparently before they had phonemail-based registration, everyone used to have to head down to the basketball court and fill out bubble sheets that were set up across acres of tables.",

Those courses were often used as weedout courses: they were so hard that anyone that couldn\u2019t handle the mental challenge of a CS degree would give up, which was a good thing, because if you thought pointers are hard, wait until you try to prove things about fixed point theory.\n\n&gt; All the kids who did great in high school writing pong games in BASIC for their Apple II would get to college, take CompSci 101, a data structures course, and when they hit the pointers business their brains would just totally explode, and the next thing you knew, they were majoring in Political Science because law school seemed like a better idea. I\u2019ve seen all kinds of figures for drop-out rates in CS and they\u2019re usually between 40% and 70%. The universities tend to see this as a waste; I think it\u2019s just a necessary culling of the people who aren\u2019t going to be happy or successful in programming careers.",

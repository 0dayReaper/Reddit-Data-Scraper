    "postText": "Hey everyone, I\u2019m and incoming GS student and I\u2019m intensely concerned about how I\u2019m going to manage paying for life in NYC especially with GS\u2019 less than generous financial aid. \n\nI just got my housing done and the rent is really scaring me already\u2026 I really don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to afford a decent college student life without having to sacrifice little things like enjoying a dinner with my friends every now and then.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience or tips with how to negotiate financial aid? Or any recommendations on jobs / side hustles? How do you guys manage?\n\nMy family is really struggling to find ways to come up with money as my siblings are also beginning college in high-tuition institutions as well now but I\u2019m not sure that GS will care.\n\nI would really appreciate any ideas or anecdotes from your experiences.",

If you got in here, you were likely accepted into other top schools with much better financial aid, in much more affordable areas.\n\nYou can apply for federal grants.  They aren't much, but I do get a couple thousand a year through that.",

I starved myself and couldn't really enjoy my student years as even the subway ticket felt like too expensive.  I got the career that \"pays the bills easily\" in MBB consulting but that time at Columbia changed me. I still feel anxious when paying for things, having constant buyers remorse. I punish myself for spending and do not feel financially secure even when my earnings are twice the average household income. \n\nI don't have an advice here but my point is - when you make the decision, find your peace with it. Find peace with the possibility of having open door and opportunities and find peace in the option that you might live paycheck to paycheck. Let your personal motivation guide you and find help if the peace doesn't come.",

You\u2019ll have summers where you can make 40-50k as a student and walk into a full time job making well over 6 figures.\n\nBut, if you don\u2019t plan on selling your soul to Wall Street or Big Tech, it makes 0 sense to put yourself in that much debt to get a job that you can get attending a much cheaper state school. \n\nYou gotta figure out what your risk to reward ratio is for attending hombre.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what you asked, so I\u2019ll tell you what I do to make extra cash. I intern, work study, do research, and run a small business. \n\nNon veteran gs\u2019ers who aren\u2019t from rich families really struggle here because there isn\u2019t a ton of support for you guys. Just something to be aware of. \n\nI don\u2019t mean to be a downer, I just want to help reset your baseline expectations with the reality of GS so it\u2019s not as much of a shock. \n\nI wish you and your family the best of luck as you make this transition.",

This is all so stressful and honestly really confusing as someone who has just started to look into it. It also seems like the CCE hasn\u2019t posted anything yet for summer 2024, so feeling a bit lost\u2026",

Honestly, for the sheer amount of money you pay, it's simply not worth it. You're far better off going to a state school where the tuition is much cheaper than coming here and being in 6 figures of debt. Avoid debt like the plague.\n\nIf it makes you feel any better, I work for a top tech firm as a software engineer and many of my coworkers went to schools you've never heard of in fly over states. They make the same amount as I do and have the same job title. \n\nYou can still have what you want and get to where you want to be without an ivy league education.",

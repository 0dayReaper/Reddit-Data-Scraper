            "comment": "Hey, current senior in the jazz program. Happy to answer any questions. \n\n\"The jazz ensemble\" is a misnomer; there are about a dozen jazz ensembles at Columbia. Currently, they're all combos with several having a special focus (free jazz, latin, etc). As far as I'm aware, everyone gets into a combo. The top three combos get to perform with the guest artist each semester. The auditions are more for placement than they are for gatekeeping the program from anyone. There's usually a big band but there weren't enough saxophones this year to fill it. In any case, the combos are the lifeblood of the jazz program. In previous years Bruce Barth directed the top combo but it seems Don Sickler is taking the reigns over going forward. The top combo won the Next Gen combo competition at the Monterey Jazz Fest a few years back. It's generally pretty easy to get into \\*A\\* combo but hard to get into the top three combos. \n\nThere are biweekly jam session on campus at ADP via the Coffehaus Jam Club and the jazz program generally hosts a session at the beginning of each semester at the music building. \n\nJazz House went defunct last year due to a lack of interest.\n\nTo be frank, though, the jazz program doesn't matter much; you're in NYC. If you head to Smalls with an open mind and an active ear on a random weeknight, you'll learn more than you would in a classroom. A lot of the more advanced jazz musicians at Columbia don't even participate in the jazz program on campus and just gig around the city and go to sessions. The jazz faculty here are all pretty active on the scene and will put you on the list for their gigs if you ask nicely and they have free invites.",

Some ensembles are piano/bass/drums while others are sax/trombone/trumpet/piano/bass/drums and others are trombone/guitar/bass/drums, etc. There currently just aren't many saxophonists on campus for whatever reason.",

            "comment": "Making breaking codes, undergrad seminars in math, and modern algebra (with algebra dependant on professor from what I've heard) are all easier or less work of classes than the ones you have here. \n\nIf you don't mind giving/preparing for a single lecture during the semester by essentially reading a textbook chapter ahead of time and taking notes, undergrad seminars is by far the least work I've ever put in a class (but was also one of the least interesting and it's relatively dependant on your section and the topic you want to learn). \n\nModern algebra is more work than the others but probably less time than 2500 and about equal with linear week to week, but because it's pretty abstract and proof based, it can be hard if you don't have previous experience with that stuff. \n\nMaking breaking codes is a really fun class that talks about the math behind cryptography, and the concepts are generally not too bad to pick up (mostly modular arithmetic), though since the work is easier and more interesting than most math classes imo, it's a bit harder to get into and either doesn't have a curve or only has a small one (I can't remember exactly).\n\nI'd probably recommend making breaking codes over everything else cause undergrad seminars honestly felt like a complete waste of time especially if you're only doing a concentration and aren't going further into math.",

If you're gonna work somewhere where this matters, then they'll care more about what classes you classes over your major, both otherwise it definitely doesn't hurt you in the long run if you're only 1 or 2 classes away from the math concentration to add it on",

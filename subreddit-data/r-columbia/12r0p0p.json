    "postText": "Hello fellow Columbia students! I am currently a junior studying Physics and Computer Science, and I'm on the lookout for an internship opportunity this summer. I will be living in NYC during that time and would love to gain some practical experience in the fields of Physics or CS.\n\nDespite my best efforts, I haven't been able to find any suitable internship opportunities so far. Therefore, I thought I'd turn to the Columbia community and see if anyone has any leads or suggestions.\n\nAs a physics and computer science major, I have a strong foundation in both theory and practical applications. I have experience with programming languages like Java, Python, and C++, and I'm comfortable with data analysis and visualization tools like MATLAB and R. I'm also familiar with Linux and Windows operating systems.\n\nI'm particularly interested in internships that focus on the intersection of physics and computer science, such as data analysis in physics or software development for scientific simulations. However, I'm open to exploring other areas as well.\n\nIf you have any suggestions or know of companies looking for interns in NYC, I would greatly appreciate your help. Please feel free to DM me or leave a comment below. Thank you!",

I still see internship positions on LinkedIn, so maybe just keep hammering those applications out? Maybe even try targeting startups on AngelList if possible or try to find a prof that wants a swe to help them with a project?",

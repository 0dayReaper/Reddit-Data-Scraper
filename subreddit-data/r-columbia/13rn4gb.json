    "postText": "hello \n\ni am incoming masters student and i got an offer for on campus housing, however availability is extremely limited and there\u2019s only rooms in whittier hall (my last choice rip). i just want to know if anybody has lived or visited this building before and can tell me if it\u2019s as bleak as it looks in the pictures lol\n\nidk if i want to be living in a freshman type dorm again as a graduate student so would appreciate any pros u have about living here aside from obviously proximity and reduced cost compared to off campus prices \ud83d\ude2d\n\ni would\u2019ve gladly gone to a single room but sharing a bathroom with all the people on ur floor sounds like freshman hell all over again. also not really fond of suites since i already lived with 5-6 people in undergrad and would rather avoid that \n\nso basically i just want to know what\u2019s it like living at whittier and if the shared spaces (kitchen+bathroom) get too crowded",

It\u2019s convenient if you\u2019re in a short masters program and don\u2019t plan to stay in the city afterwards. \n\nIt\u2019s reasonably priced and the bathrooms/kitchens are cleaned professionally so that\u2019s a pro. Some of the rooms in Whittier suites are quite large. Everyone is nice and they host events to make friends/meet your neighbors. Bring or buy an air conditioner as it does get hot April-Oct.",

Bathroom and showers do get shared with people, there are around three stalls and three shower box total in my floor (excluding suites) and they do get cleaned every morning. Kitchen can get crowded during lunch or dinner time so avoid those if you don't want people. (one kitchen each floor) If you have other questions lemme know!",

    "postText": "Is the MS CS program worth it? It\u2019s 70k and looking on LinkedIn it seems that there are lots of foreigners in the program, which worries me about the program just being a pathway for people to get work in the US. Also, I see posts about it being cash cow. I know a lot of US university MS programs are considered cash cows anyway, but is Columbia different? Additionally, how difficult is it to do research? Do professors / labs just not answer emails?",

            "comment": "70k is far too much for any degree, regardless of the field of study. You can use that money to buy something of real value, such as a down payment on a house in some states. \n\nYes, most masters programs in CS are for foreigners looking to break into the US tech labor market. They are largely just cash cows, although not always. Columbia is a great school but they need to make money somehow, and cash cow programs like this are one means of doing that. \n\nIf you're struggling to get into the tech field, you're better off grinding leet code, building projects on your own, and applying to as many developer positions as possible. Once you start working, get your employer to pay for a degree program like this one. \n\nBest of luck to you.",

    "postText": "For context, I am a former semi-pro photographer, so I know a little bit about photo quality.\n\nI paid $50 to download the image that Island Photography took of me graduating, and the quality is not what one would expect from a professional photographer. The highlights were underexposed; it's not something I would in good conscience give to someone I had shot photos of, even for free. \n\nIt's as if Island Photography did not make any edits in post-production to the photos before uploading them to their site.\n\nThere were two retouching options - one for $15 and one for $25. I didn't expect I would need to pay for basic post-processing.\n\nThe company is a ripoff, and Columbia shouldn't accept any lower quality for its graduation photos than it would from its Public Affairs photos. After all, graduation is a huge milestone, and having decent-quality pictures should be a given.\n\nI'd rather stay anonymous on here, so I won't upload the photo.\n\nBut Columbia can do far better than outsource its graduation photos to a third-rate outfit with photos that are hardly worth the price.\n\nStay far, far away!",

I'm pretty sure it's not just some filter they apply/the lower resolution versions of the images on the site cause some of the watermarked photos have higher quality than the others, it just seems like they didn't even attempt to get a good photo since they were going through everyone in the line.\n\nFunnily enough, I had the opposite problem where one of mine is extremely overexposed. I really like how one of the shots isn't focused and then another image they add is a digitally zoomed in version of the same bad image. And then also a black and white version of it. And then each of them cost like $40 individually. Once again, for photos where hastily taken phone camera pictures ended up turning out better. \n\nThis is an absolute scam lol, there's no way we're buying them",

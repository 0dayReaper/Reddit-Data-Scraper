These types of courses are only one credit and do not in anyway count towards major requirements.  The procedures are wildly different for SEAS and CC/GS.\n\nIf you're not an international student looking for work authorization, these really aren't of any use to you.\n\nAlso, you can tell that page is old since St. Luke's - Roosevelt hasn't been called that for the last 3 years or so.",

            "comment": "It's true that Columbia doesn't award credit for internships as such, but there is a way for Columbia College students to earn one point while doing an internship, job, etc.: take the course called Core as Praxis/Fieldwork (HUMA 2000). During the summer, it's tuition-free for Columbia College students (GS students do need to pay for the point, which seems vastly unfair). **HUMA 2000 can be taken only by students who have already declared a major, and can be taken only twice,** so in practice, it's mostly taken in the summers between sophomore and junior year and between junior and senior year. I believe the course, in which you select a text from Lit Hum or CC to write about in connection with your job/internship/volunteer position/etc., is online and asynchronous. It gives international students the ability to work for pay, because earning course credit allows them to count the job as CPT. It can be handy for other students too--e.g., if an internship requires you to earn credit because it is unpaid (which sucks, but it happens).\n\nAs someone said below, SEAS students have a course in their major department called \"Fieldwork\" that works in a similar way.\n\nYour work has to have some clear connection to your program of study in both cases.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m interested in this program, but since I\u2019m an incoming transfer student, could I still apply? I\u2019m coming in with 31 credits plus some AP credits, but since this program is so accelerated, will it be hard to get accepted to if I didn\u2019t spend my first year at Barnard?\n\nAlso, is it possible to do a minor in this program? Or at the very least take a few classes outside of your major? I\u2019d love to minor in English/creative writing but I know that this program is accelerated and may not leave space for extra classes.",

Professor was like, \"I checked and the questions are all different\", like, what? Columbia needs to review its grading policies, this is some bullshit. So unfair for people who actually grinded.",

In both of his 4995s, he makes the grading criteria appear overly strict in the syllabi in hopes that it'll motivate students to make a genuine effort. In practice, most students struggle to completely solve the problems from live contests, so he resorts to these survey points to ensure that nobody tanks their grade.\n\nI disagree about it being unfair though. Competitive programming has a steep learning curve, and many of the live contest problems are harder than a typical LeetCode hard. There's value in struggling on a problem even if one isn't able to solve it at the end, so if he graded exclusively on the correctness of solutions to live contest problems, it wouldn't accurately reflect one's progress in the course either.",

And if you make the calculations, you only need to complete the 13 weekends contests (just 1 problem is enough) for 65 points, and the extra 35 can come from the surveys stuff. So, finishing 13 easy problems gives you guranteed A+ in the class. No offense to other people but anyone who comes into the class knowing at least one programming language should be able to achieve that. Compare that to other CS courses, e.g. OS, and there is a huge gap in the time requirement.",

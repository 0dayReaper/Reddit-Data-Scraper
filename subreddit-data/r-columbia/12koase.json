The process has been ridiculously difficult. Did anyone else take credits outside? If so, what was the process like for you? What did you do?",

You have to present them with the course catalog, syllabus, etc. The course has to be taken at an accredited 4-year institution where a course is equivalent to a Columbia class. \n\nYou can\u2019t take a core class either. Those must be taken at Columbia. \n\nAlso grades from courses taken outside of Columbia won\u2019t count towards your gpa.",

I've heard the approval percentage is in the single digits (don't quote me), and it's especially hard to get humanities class to count. This may help.",

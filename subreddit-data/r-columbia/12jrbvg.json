    "postText": "Hello!\nI\u2019ve recently been accepted into both unis and been in between Columbia and Berkeley.\nThey\u2019re both close in terms of prestige, but Columbia has that \u201civy\u201d status. Both unis are in nice locations. From what I\u2019ve read, Columbia seems easier to get opportunities, internships, and research because of the small student to faculty ratio. However, Berkeley is better ranked in engineering.\n\nI\u2019m really trying to get advice from everyone and see everyone\u2019s perspective.\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "I'm a Cal engineering grad who's heading to Columbia for grad school (MBA), so think I'll be able to give a pretty unbiased take on this. During my college admissions process I chose Berkeley over a number of other private schools (not Columbia, think UChicago/Johns Hopkins/Cornell). At the time, I based my decision on\n\n1. Cal's engineering program is objectively stronger than the schools I listed above, and has strong connections to local Bay Area companies (not so much for bioengineering, but more on this later)\n2. In-state tuition\n3. Strong focus on diversity/students from \"normal\" socioeconomic backgrounds. As an Asian American, it was eye-opening to be at a school where almost half of the undergrad student population looked like me.\n\nAll of the above still hold true, but here are some caveats I wish I knew when I was making my decisions:\n\n1. Yes, Cal's engineering program is strong but this advantage is mostly centered on EECS/CS majors OR academia. EECS/CS because there's so many tech firms across the bay, and academia b/c Berkeley professors focus a lot on theory &gt; application, esp. in your upper div classes. Berkeley's grade deflation is not to be underestimated; you can work your ass off and still end up with a B- at the end of the semester, simply b/c the department decided to curve to a 3.2.\n2. Important to note, if you're planning on going into industry (research) without pursuing higher education (PhD), your opportunities as a BioE are going to be fairly limited. There are simply too many biology majors competing for a limited # of research tech jobs every year. If this is your passion and you're looking to stay in academia, then totally ignore this segment. Just anecdotally, most of my friends who started as BioE switched into EECS/IEOR/MechE by their sophomore year\n3. Lower in-state tuition also means less funding for basic programs at Cal. Berkeley housing is notoriously terrible, to the point where they were cramming students into triples/quads in Unit 1/2 just a few years back. Some of the buildings (Evans/VLSB/Wheeler/Etcheverry/RSF) are in need of serious renovations.\n4. Safety is an actual issue at Cal. You can take a look at r/berkeley for more info, but it is fairly lawless around Telegraph/Durant, especially around People's Park. People tend to downplay this, but everyone I know has had some kind of weird/sketchy incident in their 4 years here.\n5. Getting into certain clubs at Cal is ultracompetitive. Most consulting clubs/professional fraternities have &lt;5% acceptance rate each semester and require multiple rounds of interviews. This is a result of the massive student population; there's just too many students competing for a limited number of spots.\n6. Berkeley admin is straight up unhelpful. Too many students, too few admin people, too little funding.\n\nBerkeley is not the school for everyone; it prides itself on its \"sink or swim\" environment and you definitely run the risk of feeling lost. I loved my time at Cal, but owe this entirely to the friends I made there and not the school itself.",

Just because people at my program had different experiences than yours doesn\u2019t mean that we have to resort to name-calling. Anyway, you can check the numbers for yourself via the Cal [Post-graduation survey](https://career.berkeley.edu/start-exploring/bear-destinations/). \n\nTo set the record straight it\u2019s not at all impressive that your classmates were able to \u201cget a job\u201d. Any average joe can get a corporate job pushing pencils around. Your long term career outcomes as a BioE major are going to be limited unless you pursue higher education (at least in the research realm). \n\nIf you have numbers to help support your stance, I\u2019m all ears. Until then you\u2019re basically just yelling nonsense into the void",

            "comment": "Hey!\n\nI transferred from Berkeley to Columbia so I think I can provide some perspective, although I'm majoring in CS, not BioE/BME so your mileage may vary. Obviously I'm a bit biased considering I'm at Columbia now, but I don't think you can go wrong either way.\n\nPersonally I think that if you're paying in state for Berkeley and (near) full price at Columbia, Berkeley is definitely the better option from a pure value standpoint, but if the price is similar I would lean towards Columbia.\n\nMy personal opinion is that at this level, the subject ranking is not really that important\u2013although Berkeley has a more prominent CS department, I found that the CS department class offerings are significantly more varied here at Columbia because of the smaller student body size.\n\nI think classic\\_goody made a lot of good points\u2013I just wanted to add some more context from the perspective of the undergraduate experience.\n\nWhy choose Columbia?\n\n* On campus housing is guaranteed for all four years, better, and cheaper\n   * Getting a single is much more attainable, and the worst you'll get is a double while Berkeley will be doubles and triples\n* The area around Columbia is significantly safer than Berkeley\n* Smaller class sizes in general\n   * Also means fewer people competing for research and whatever\n* You're in the biggest city in the country and one of the most interesting places in the world\n   * Other than nature, there's way more to do in NYC and there's also public transit that can take you to basically anywhere in the area\n* On campus food is significantly better at Columbia\n* Columbia is more flexible if you want to change your major (especially if you're considering CS)\n* Smaller campus means that everything is close by\n* More diverse (geographically and racially)\n\nWhy choose Berkeley?\n\n* Cost (if that applies to you)\n* More school spirit\n* Weather is consistently pretty comfortable\n* Close to a lot of beautiful nature\n* Personal opinion but I think the off campus food scene in the immediate vicinity is better in Berkeley but you've also got access to all of NYC at Columbia\n* If you've got credit coming in you may be able to graduate earlier more easily or take time off for off season internships\n   * Not sure about BME but at least for CS Columbia (SEAS specifically) has more graduation requirements\n\nWhat's similar?\n\n* Clubs are competitive\n* Administration can be extremely convoluted/useless\n* Campuses are beautiful\n* In urban environments\n* Strong reputations overall\n* Both expensive areas\n\nI'm sure I missed a lot, but feel free to reply or DM if you've got questions!",

    "postText": "I had a Barnard professor for both levels of Elementary spanish and I struggled, as I always have with foreign languages. For Intermediate 1, I had Professor Lee Abraham; who I can't say enough good things about, he made learning enjoyable and relatively stress free. He unfortunately does not teach Intermediate 2. Is there anyone on here who can recommend professors similar to him?",

    "postText": "I am an incoming freshman that would be joining CU this fall. I'm at SEAS planning to double major in mathematics and CS.\n\nBut I don't know how to code. I did try out java and C++, but there is nothing I remember from those classes. I just chose CS as my major because it is interesting to me and something that I see myself doing.\n\nSo would I be at disadvantage for not knowing how to code?\n\nIf so, what can I do this summer to have less trouble?",

In retrospect, things would have probably been smoother if I had spent the summer before learning an oop language, like java or python. There are tons of free and very useful resources out there to do just that, I recommend you find one! It's a good, fun skill to learn, and would put you ahead in your classes.\n\nAlso I recommend python &gt; java",

It might be a little harder, but tbh there\u2019s a ton of office hours that you can attend in case you need help. Also intro to Java w prof blaer is a great intro course. As long as you put in the work you will do good.  I also think that practicing a little over the summer should give you a head start maybe CS50? Just dedicate a good chunk of your time of your clases once you are taking them, practice makes perfect for cs.",

I would definitely encourage attempting to learn a bit of java or python this summer just to make it go smoother though.\n\nHowever, double majoring in mathematics isn\u2019t really possible in seas. A) Mathematics itself isn\u2019t a major offered, Applied Mathematics is. and B)SEAS doesn\u2019t let you double count courses for majors, so you\u2019d have to take two separate sets of courses. A minor is definitely feasible and I encourage you to do it.",

However you can\u2019t double count for majors, and *i don\u2019t think* you can receive credit for more than one linear algebra course(i may be wrong).\n\nYou can however double count for major and minor, so you can minor in it no problem.\n\nfeel free to dm me with questions",

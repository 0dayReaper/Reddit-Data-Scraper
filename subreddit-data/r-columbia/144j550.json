I'm not complaining of course, and I'm very grateful, but I'm wondering what the cutoff for summa was. \n\nMy GPA was a bit over 4.0. It seems like these cutoffs are getting higher with every passing year. \n\nI'm just curious, and I'm wondering if y'all have any information.",

French gives A+s, Italian does not). Students believe they need a high GPA or Latin honors to \"do well,\" so they'll seek out every opportunity. CCSC has some shocking data about it in their [Latin honors revision proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uVjnqq11Za7z6tliJuAOaCGjp7u9BV00gasWLjs9hMY/edit), including the average cutoffs and the average grade in select majors. Grades skew positively toward the humanities, which don't have curves and can be more subjective.",

That just feels wild and almost impossible to achieve *without* being highly selective of professors (not saying it can't be done though!).\n\nWould also be interesting to see if there are departments that graduate more students with Latin Honors than others. For example\u2014and I recognize that SEAS has its own cutoffs\u2014but I feel like for SEAS, almost every student I've learned who achieved Summa Cum Laude majored in Computer Science.",

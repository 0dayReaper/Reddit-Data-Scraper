            "comment": "Berklee's tuition cost is way too much, especially when a lot of the material can be learned online for free. If you pay full price for 4 years at Berklee then you'll end up with 200K+ of debt. Berklee is a great school, but going into that kind of debt for a music degree is not worth it for most people. I'm going there on a full scholarship right now and I'm still hurting financially; living costs alone in Boston are sky high.\n\nNot trying to discourage you, though. Just giving my opinion. Good luck \ud83d\ude4f",

The cost of a dorm right now levels out to about $2K per month, which is ridiculous because some of the dorms are just rundown converted hotels. Definitely not worth it unless you are in the 160 or 150 buildings.\nIn terms of scholarships you can reach out to them if you need additional help for living but it's not guaranteed.\nIf you can find a 3 or 4 roommates, it's possible to get a decent apartment and only pay $1K per month. I'd recommend that as the Berklee dorms are v overpriced. Good luck!",

They're definitely worth applying for, but they're usually pretty competitive. If you're an international student it's also worth seeing if your country has anything to offer for scholarships.",

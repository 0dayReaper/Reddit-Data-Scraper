You can ask them any question and they can help prepare you during your 5 week program. Plus you have your core music theory and ear training classes that could also help you review and learn a couple things for the audition. Also you get early decision if you apply during the summer program plus some other benefits you\u2019ll find out once you do your orientation. \n\nSo def go in prepared and you\u2019ll get in.\n\nI did my 5 week last year, auditioned there, and got in.\n\nFeel free to message me any questions you have about 5 week!",

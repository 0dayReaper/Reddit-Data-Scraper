Maybe you could look at rhythmic patterns into the syncopation book (a book for drummers but that is so useful for other musicians as well). You should really feel it, listen to blues solos by bassists and have fun!",

One of the things they have us do is arpeggiate the chord changes so that we get comfortable playing the chord tones, following that they then have us improvise over the track with just using the chord tones! That\u2019s been super helpful for me and I think it\u2019s a great place to start",

I want to go, but unsure if the financial burden would be worth it, (up to $40,000 more in debt from fafsa for the two years, plus any private loans I would have to take out :,()",

You know what he does \"professionally\" to get the bills paid?  He works at Tesla part time and sells suits during the other hours.  Oh, and his mom moved out to LA to live with him so he wouldn't have to pay rent.  \n\n\nYou don't want this.  Trust me.  It is NOT worth it.  Not on any level.  Do NOT give a scholastic institution this kind of money for music degrees, but especially composition.    \n\n\nGet out into the world and compose.  Submit your work.  Get involved.  A school that charges this much is insanity.  And think about it.  They are giving you $20k and its no skin off their back.  They know what they're selling.  It's all garbage.    \n\n\nJust go do it.  Get into the world.  Now.  Don't spend another dollar on school.    \n\n\nCome on.  I'm being serious here.  Don't waste your time or money.",

            "comment": "Hello! Berklee alum here. I totally get wanting to go to Berklee; however, the cost is way too high. I would say go for it if you can take out FEDERAL loans, as they are flexible in terms of payback options and the future is hopeful in terms of loan forgiveness in that realm. \n\nDo NOT take out private loans, I.e., Sallie Mae, Navient, etc. because you will throw money at the balance for a lifetime, it will only get higher due to interest, and you will inevitably default creating the potentiality of a lawsuit and a promised, perpetual worry. I am talking from experience here.",

The loans and interest rates I was quoted are astronomically expensive from non-federal agencies and I got jipped on federal loans. I\u2019m honestly feeling really down about the situation but I\u2019m also wondering how folks even afford Berklee without having parents that make tens of millions of dollars a year.",

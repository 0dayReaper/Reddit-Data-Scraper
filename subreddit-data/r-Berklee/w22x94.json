    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m a 19 year old Boston University student looking to meet people to make music or be in a band. I play guitar, bass guitar and sing in one of the acapella groups on campus. I\u2019m currently in Boston over the summer and would love to meet new people! Also if anyone knows of places for open mic in Boston that would be great as well! My Instagram is @http_.evan if anyone wants to contact me!",

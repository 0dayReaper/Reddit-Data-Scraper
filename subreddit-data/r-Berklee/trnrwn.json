    "postText": "Let's say you get in to Berklee but don't get any scholarship money at all. Let's also say that your family is not very well off financially Is it possible to attend Berklee with Federal Loans in this situation? Would you be able use Student Employment to pay for it? Would on-campus housing even be an option at that point? \n\nIs there anything you can do in that situation?",

            "comment": "This is for any school, not just Berklee: Federal loans (and grants) have to be awarded to you, and you go through the process each year. For instance, for my older son (not Berklee), we got no Federal grant, and the only Federal loan we were offered was an unsubsidized loan, meaning interest starts right away rather than when you graduate (loan was $5k). We weren't even offered a subsidized loan, so that wasn't an option. You also have to be offered work study. I would never recommend a student go into massive debt for ANY college when there are more affordable options available.  I really recommend talking with a financial aid counselor so you understand all the options and don't get yourself into a tough situation.",

I\u2019m rocking payments around 1500 a month and still have 35k left a decade later. The cost of living out there is insane, too. Just be mindful of the hole you\u2019re digging and what your income might look like after you get done.",

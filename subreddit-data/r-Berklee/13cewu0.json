            "comment": "One of the main benefits of the 5-week program is that it really helps you figure out if Berklee (and Boston) is the place you want to go for 4 years.Yes, the summer program is  expensive but it also may keep you from spending $40k first semester and finding out it is not the place for you...\n\n It's totally immersive, music 24/7, just like college there will be. And you should take advantage of every clinic, concert, etc that is offered outside of class time.\n\nYou can also do your Berklee audition while you are there which is a big advantage as you will probably be in the best musical shape of your life at the end of the program and will likely be a lot more comfortable than going up there and doing it cold. You can also get advice from your summer teachers about the audition process....huge..\nDoing an early audition also let's you apply earlier and get and admission decision in the fall.\n\n\nYou will make friends there that will enter Berklee with you..big help with freshman adjustment.\n\nJust my two cents as a Berklee graduate and parent of a current Berklee student....",

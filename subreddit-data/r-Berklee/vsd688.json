I\u2019ve also asked on the Berklee app too about this to see if any student has done it and none -  those who attended aspire before said they\u2019ll make one for you once you arrive. You should sign up for the Berklee event app if you haven\u2019t already. You should\u2019ve gotten an email to download and sign up.",

I can't imagine if I was studying production and that kind of gear that I only really could get access to at school was such an important part of my music-making. if that were the case I might be more likely to consider going back to campus, but it still would feel like such a gamble. \n\nI'm also concerned about what reopening means for public health, and personally for me (again as someone who doesn't require access to equipment and resources in the way I think a lot of other students do) I would have been totally open to taking all of my classes online if I didn't still have to pay 45k for it.",

Think about it, practice rooms are going to be here to come by, especially drums since the students will have to use them for their remote private instruction and other classes on top of practicing for your homework. Studio time and ensemble room reservations are going to be a pain in the dick. Online classes at the price of on campus classes, and for the cherry on top, you have to wear a fucking mask 24/7. If you have to pay your own way through Berklee, which I do, it might be worth it to self study on your time off and wait to go to school until it gets back to normal.",

Both full tuition. \n\nWe also can take Berklee Online courses to fulfill a few liberal arts requirements or production credits, but I believe those still are treated like transfer credits, so as a transfer student who has already transferred in my max 24 credits that isn\u2019t an option for me.",

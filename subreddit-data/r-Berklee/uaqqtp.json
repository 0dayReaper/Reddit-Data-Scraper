I few methods I would suggest is to create a profile through the website Roomsurf (applies to both off-campus or on-campus housing). There you could pick certain options that you want both for yourself and for your roommate. It\u2019s going to help match you with other Berklee students looking for roommates, who shares similar preferences as you.\nIf you only want off-campus housing, you can check out the Berklee Off-Campus Housing page/group through Facebook. It\u2019s a private group, so I think you have to answer some questions before you can join it.\n\nIf you want to communicate, feel free to send me a DM through here or Insta! My main Instagram is @reanakirzten and my music-based account is @reanakirzten.sings :)",

I also requested to follow that page, they declined it a few times, then they finally accepted it, I guess it\u2019s based on luck :))\nI\u2019ve met a lot of people on Instagram (mine is @florindr1).

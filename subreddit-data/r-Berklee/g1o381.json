    "postText": "If a bit of background info  \nI am almost 16 and I\u2019m planning to apply to Berklee in 2022 or so. \nI am from Turkey and i\u2019m most proficient at piano but can also play 5 other instruments and sing (my vocal range is around 3,5 octaves). I also compose music and i\u2019m influenced by psychedelia, prog, space rock, swing, blues, dixieland, and classical. My biggest influences are Klaatu, The Doors, The Beatles, Bix Beiderbecke, Artie Shaw, Tommy Dorsey, Leonard Bernstein, Wendy Carlos, Felix Arndt and Silver Apples. I can improvise fairly well, am improving my sight reading and I\u2019m good at keeping rhythm, even in \u201ccomplex\u201d time signatures like 9/8, 7/8 etc.\nEver since I was like 11, i\u2019ve transcribed music as a hobby (from big band scores to rock songs). I am currently practicing a novelty ragtime song for the audition as i believe it demonstrates my technical abilities the best (although if its unlikely to get in with that kind of piece, i can also play Blue Rondo A la Turk and i\u2019m pretty sure i\u2019d be able to master it in the next two years). My grades were improving but because of the whole pandemic, all my exams were postponed. I can also do a fair bit of audio editing and build my own instruments.\nSo what is the best way I can prepare for the audition in the next few years ? all help is appreciated.",

To be talented is one thing, but talent is useless without creativity and passion. While there are many prodigies and virtuosos in the world, most of them will be forgotten as they don't have anything new to offer and only play what was already out there. There are thousands of child prodigies who can play the flight of the bumblebee, yet there was only one Rimsky Korsakov.",

Not trying to downplay grades but there really is no substitute for practice. Work on all facets of musicianship. Work on your technique, repertoire, improvisation, sightreading, ear, theory,,  time feel, etc.",

I want to major in MP&amp;E and work in the film and television industry doing sound but idk if the debt will be worth it in the long hall. Berklee\u2019s a dream but I may have to decline and reapply. Just wanted some thoughts on how people have survived Berklee in the lower scholarships and if it\u2019s worth it overall?",

            "comment": "In my  opinion, do not go into debt for Berklee. I have worked in VFX for the film industry in Los Angeles for 20 years, and I work and am friends with musicians from all over. For myself and them, its feast and famine out here. Its tough enough to survive with no debt at all, let alone make a loan payment on top. And I have worked on Oscar winning films and schlock films, but the pay is basically the same. Do this job because its drives you and gets you up every morning happy to go to work, but don't do this job to get rich. Its not gonna happen. If the scholarship isn't enough, go get your GEDs out of the way the first two years at your state school, and re audition to Berklee again and again til you get the financials you need, or go somewhere cheaper with a great rep and great teachers. When I hire VFX people to work with, I never ask or look at what school they went to. If their reel is great and they work well with others, they get hired. I will take an above average artist that follows orders over a \"genius\" artist who comes in late and can't take criticism. Good luck however you decide!",

It\u2019s actually kind of funny because aside from MP&amp;E and Berklee I\u2019ve been curious about the VFX industry as well and thought about doing that as well. No matter what I have certainly not chosen the most secure fields in the world. Creative but not secure and that\u2019s the hard thing. I\u2019ll take your advice",

Find the people you get along with and work together to forge the best bonds of friendship and talent you can. Because after graduation, one of those friends will get to the next level, and they will take you along with them. And if its you to get the nod, then you take them too. The guy I sat next to at my art school became my best bud, and he got hired at Dreamworks after graduation, and on his word there he got me in 3 months later. Then after my first year I knew people at Digital Domain, Sony, Pixar, etc, so I never had to worry long about work after that.",

The ones I know kicking ass did a short affordable program in Nashville so they had a head start building contacts and had some internship work on major albums. I would never discourage someone from going to Berklee but if finances are a major concern, then maybe consider a more affordable program hopefully in the city you hope to be based in.",

My daughter starts at Berklee in the fall, and she wants the same type of career, but on the vocal side of things.  She has over a 3 octave range, can sight sing and has perfect pitch.  I'll slide you her reel after her first year there if thats okay. Love to get your input.",

            "comment": "Ok, this was in the mid-00's so YMMV because Berklee is much more expensive now, but I survived at Berklee then without any merit scholarship. I busted my ass, though--I worked full-time the entire time I was enrolled, took classes every summer (the summer term is slightly cheaper because it's a shorter semester), and my final year I was actually working about 80 hours a week across three jobs. It was absolute madness, but I graduated with only 20k in debt. I also busted my butt at school and was able to get several, one-time, departmental scholarships that helped cover some of the fees. A few notes that are important for context:\n\n  \n\\- I transferred in the max number of liberal arts credits  \n\\- I was a performance major, which is one of the most flexible majors  \n\\- I used credit by exam to get out of a few things, including two levels of private instruction  \n\\- Housing was much cheaper back then, so my rent the whole time I was at Berklee was never over $700/month.\n\nFor me it was absolutely worth it, but again this was a long time ago and the cost has only gone up. If you do end up going, I recommend that you bust ass and get out as quickly as possible, and take advantage of every opportunity you can to CBX or transfer in credits. Also, talk to your department about scholarship opportunities, those saved my butt!",

You won't be able to pay that money back without getting a real job, ad you will have a harder time getting a real job if you have a worthless music degree. I graduated in 2012 from Berklee, starved for years, finally went to a coding bootcamp in 2016 and now I actually make money and can support my family. Think about retirement too. If you have a measly gig or project based salary you will have a harder time svaing for your future. Now I max out my Roth IRA and 401(k) every year. \n\nThink seriously about your future before going into that kind of debt You're better off saving the money and using it to fund your living while you make music and learn from YouTube tutorials.",

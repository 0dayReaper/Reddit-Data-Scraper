    "postText": "  I'm planning on applying to Berklee and I'm in need of some information, I would be glad if you could help me out, but first, I'll share some information about my background. I'm a guitarist, I started playing when I was around 15 and got some interest in rock music, especially guitar solos, however I wasn't very clean and precise, and one year after learning a few solos I started improvising (Quite badly honestly). Overtime, I started learning some music theory, which helped me to understand the way in which music worked. By the end of high school, I knew how to move my fingers around a scale and had memorized a few classic rock solos, and that was enough to be more impressive than my peers in high school. Of course, I overestimated my abilities and decided to apply to what was regarded as the best music university in my country, the national music university. \n\nThe education there was focused on classical music, and consisted in 7 years, 2 years of preparation and 5 for the actual career, there was only one exam per year and only 4/60 applicants would get in. I failed the first attempt, I failed tremendously, by that time I had a terrible sense of tempo, technique, ear and sight-reading skills. It took that reality check for me to learn the importance of practice, discipline and patience, so for an entire year I practiced my repertoire for 8 hours a day, and hired a sight-reading and ear training teacher. After two years and two failed attempts I got in, determined to practice consistently trough every semester. It\u2019s been 2 years since I got in, I\u2019ve improved greatly and I\u2019ve learned a lot, I even got the 1st place prize last year, however, I have realized that the curriculum of my university lacks a few things that I consider important for music education, it has insufficient training in music technology and music production, and of course, it doesn\u2019t offer any kind of education in terms of improvisation and popular music. \n\nI\u2019ve gotten greatly invested in my classical training, but that\u2019s not what got me into music in the first place, I don\u2019t want to be just a classical musician, and be incapable of improvising and have no knowledge on music technology, I want to explore and master more than one musical genre, but unfortunately my university doesn\u2019t offer that. I\u2019ve checked Berklee\u2019s curriculum and I have found that they offer the education that I think need to achieve my goal as a performance major. \n\nI've reviewed the sight-reading and ear training samples for the audition, and I have no problem with those, I have a piece I might present as my prepared piece which I consider of moderate high level but I really don't know the standard for the difficulty of the prepared piece, and I don't feel ready for the improvisation part, I can improvise over simple progression with no extended chords and recognize the chords, but the problem is that I don't really know what the audition team expects of me on that part. The reason why I'm asking for help is because I need at least 60% of a scholarship to be able to afford Berklee, and I don't really know if I have what it takes.",

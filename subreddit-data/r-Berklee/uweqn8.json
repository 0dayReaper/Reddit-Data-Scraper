    "postText": "Hi guys, I'm Marek and I'm planning to audition for Berklee next semester, but I'd like you to share with me your experiences in the ear training part of auditioning. I am able to identify almost all kinds of chords by ear, but I just can't guess when they are played in a really low register, to be more specific, I can hear what chord the sound is, as long as it doesn't go lower than the second octave, up to the C2 or second octave or not that high pitched, I can with a lot of effort differentiate them up to the seventh octave ( 88 keys).\nSo, because I will be auditioning with the piano, my concerns are whether the interviewers would play the chords in a very low or very high register. \nIn addition I also have doubts if they will be played as four way close or will they play in somewhat more open forms like drop 2+4 chords etc.\nI would be very grateful if you could help me with this doubt that has me nervous! Thank you and I hope you have a great summer!",

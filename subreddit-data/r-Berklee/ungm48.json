    "postText": "I\u2019m a bass player going to Berklee for fall 2022, don\u2019t have any set classes or took any placement test yet. Was wondering, as mostly a jazz musician, how possible is it for me to play in orchestral/string ensembles on bass or even different instruments at the same time that I\u2019m in jazz ensembles? (My concern is being able to still play tuba after High-school and possibly taking sax lessons) Thanks!",

You have made the mistake of writing \"ect\" instead of \"etc.\"\n\n\"Ect\" is a common misspelling of \"etc,\" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase \"et cetera.\" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&amp;c.**, **&amp;c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as \"et\" to \"and\" + \"cetera\" to \"the rest;\" a literal translation to \"and the rest\" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase. \n\n[Check out the wikipedia entry if you want to learn more.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Et_cetera)\n\n^(I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

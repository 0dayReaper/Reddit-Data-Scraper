Honestly, it helps settle my nerves as I wait to hear about my admission decision. One thing I was curious about was double-majoring. I see that on the Berklee website you can combine \"many\" of the majors at Berklee. For me, I was specifically interested in double-majoring in music education and performance (I'm passionate about both things and would want to pursue them in the future). Does anyone know if that is something you can do? Or what are the limitations when it comes to double-majoring? Can you also still minor in something if you are double-majoring?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you all!!!!",

If you want to stay 5 years you can double major and minor in whatever you want, but in order to do it within the 4 years with a manageable workload, you need to look at the two majors and see what the overlap is.",

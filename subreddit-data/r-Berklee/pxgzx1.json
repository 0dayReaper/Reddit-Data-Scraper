    "postText": "Hi, I know an applicant for online Berklee who received his decision last Friday the 24th. Went to click on it and took him to a blank page. Been calling and emailing ever since. Today is the second day of online school snd still has not gotten contacted. He has no clue if he\u2019s been accepted. Is anyone on here associated with Berklee\u2019s online admission department who can help him? I know the phones were out today but doesn\u2019t explain not getting contacted yesterday. Trying all ways to contact and nothing.",

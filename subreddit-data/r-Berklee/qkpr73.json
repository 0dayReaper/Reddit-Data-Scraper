    "postText": "So I took a single summer course to see what berklee is about and I really liked it, now I\u2019m thinking of going for a undergraduate degree. I\u2019m 23, I can play the guitar and piano a bit, and  I\u2019ve been making beats for a couple of years now but I\u2019m still pretty mid at best (same for guitar and piano). I wasn\u2019t that great a student in High School, I think I graduated with like a 2.3 gpa. What I\u2019m trying to ask is, is berklee okay for someone like me who\u2019s talent is mid at best? If I were to attend it\u2019d be for music production or similar to that.",

            "comment": "I wouldn\u2019t worry so much if you are good enough for Berklee, it\u2019s your audition judges\u2019 job to determine that. I believe the EPD major is difficult to get into, but there are a few other production related majors that any Berklee student can join. The thing you want to focus on is whether or not the Berklee tuition is worth the degree for you. Berklee is a good school where you\u2019ll be able to make great connections. However, there are good schools that you can go to for much cheaper. Berklee is just as expensive as an Ivy League school. If you are truly \u201cmid level\u201d the odds of you getting a scholarship are extremely low. Berklee has an infuriatingly low endowment, and guitar usually fights with voice as the most popular primary instrument. If you are getting help from your parents, and if you can get in, it might be worth it. If you know you need a traditional school setting with more structure, and you\u2019re willing to commit to working hard to pay off your student loans, it may be worth it, but only if you push yourself to get really good. If you know you can self motivate, you can learn everything you need yourself without the student loans. Production software is expensive, but the software and equipment you\u2019ll need to get started is more affordable than four years at Berklee. It\u2019s about knowing yourself, what you want, and what you can afford. Berklee can get you where you want to go, but there are other paths. And I wouldn\u2019t stress about your skill level, Berklee faculty can assess whether you\u2019re ready, and if you\u2019re not, you can keep working to get better. :)",

                    "comment": "I was planning on going with the online route if I do decide to apply,and I already have pretty much everything needed for music production. I have Ableton live suite edition, FL studio, an audio interface, monitors, and a condenser mic that I needed for the course I took previously. I know that I don\u2019t NEED to go to a school to do what I want to do, especially how it is now with everything being so easily accessible online, but I\u2019m drawn to berklee because I struggle a bit to learn things without having a sort of guide on how to go about it. I have a couple friends who also make music but they\u2019re way better at learning on their own. For example, one of my friends has worked with a few artist already and even gotten a placement  on a project that was mainly produced by Kenny beats, and he\u2019s self taught too. Since this is like the one thing I really like doing and feel like I can do something with, I\u2019m just going to push myself a little harder and try to learn and grow as much as I can myself and if I see I\u2019m not progressing then I\u2019ll most likely end up applying to berklee",

I don\u2019t know much about Berklee online, but Berklee has great programs and they really have their stuff together with the online courses. Wherever you end up, best of luck in this next chapter of your life. :)",

    "postText": "Greetings everyone! I'm bout to be a Berklee student in May 2023, and I'm trying to find places to live off-campus with other Berklee students. Any recommendations or places to look for affordable off-campus housing?\n\nI am a singer and songwriter, a quiet and nice person who can cook and is willing to hang out with roommates and won't interrupt others. My pronouns are he/him, and I'm fine with gender-inclusive housing. I want to find somewhere within walking distance of Berklee, LGBTQ+-friendly. The time can be starting in **May 2023 / Sep 2023**. My maximum budget will be **1600**.",

Berklee suggests you dorm the first semester at least to make some friends and get used to everything, but go to offcampushousing.Berklee.edu and there you\u2019ll find apartment listings if you want. You can narrow your searches to room or full apartment. \n\nThe application form for dorms open up in February.",

            "comment": "Parent here. If you have a parent who is on Facebook, there is a Berklee parent group that circulates a lot of rooming inquiries. You do have to be a parent to join; students are not allowed. I'd avoid the Berklee off campus housing Facebook group, as it is full of scams or housing you're not likely to qualify for (i.e., grad-only or luxury apartments). \n\nI didn't find the offcampushousing site to be very helpful at all, though at least they are verified students. They will let you sign up for a limited time, but you have to have your [Berklee.edu](https://Berklee.edu) email to get any real use out of that, and that can take a while. I also didn't get much of a response when making inquiries, but that may have just been my experience.\n\nIf you're starting classes in the summer term, I'd recommend staying in the dorms for that period to get situated and start meeting people, then planning on starting an off-campus lease in the fall. You can either contact a few agents and try to nail down something now, or wait to see what opens up in August. That's definitely risky, but the veteran parents in the group all said it works out with the number of people changing places on leases in September, and it did seem to work out. But I would definitely try to get a parent or guardian on Facebook to join the group, as both my son's rooming situations were solved that way.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I'll be going to Berklee as a freshman this fall, unless COVID-19 has other plans, and I was just wondering what's the best way to prepare for Berklee. I see a lot of REALLY talented people on the Class of 2024 Facebook Group, and I'm honestly feeling a bit behind everyone else. What could I do to be \"up to standards\" this fall? If it helps, my main instrument is the piano and I'm looking into studying film scoring as of right now. I greatly appreciate all help!",

    "postText": "Hey y'all! I am so happy to see so many new people starting their journeys at Berklee this fall. I wanted to take this opportunity to highlight the Music Therapy program, as it is one of the smaller and less talked about majors on campus (but in my opinion, one of the coolest!). This major could be interesting to you if you have a passion for music, but also for psychology. Basically, if you do music to help people feel something, or you are passionate about helping others through advocacy, social justice, etc., this is for you!\n\nThe major is small, which is actually super cool, because it means you'll likely be in class with the same people you entered with all the way through graduation in small class sizes! During your third semester in the major, you get to start clinicals, which offers you the opportunity to go out and observe board-certified music therapists in the real world (in adaptive music lessons, hospitals, private practices, schools, early intervention).\n\nThe department is made up of I believe 10 or fewer faculty members, all of which are amazing and generally very well-known and connected in the world of music therapy! Some have completed published research, given TedTalks, and are recurring speakers at national conventions.\n\nAnother cool thing about this major is that it is great for those who want a clear path to employment post-grad. Your undergraduate degree culminates in a 6-9 month internship before you become board certified and are able to practice.\n\nLots of people combine this major with a business major or minor if they want to pursue a private practice business. There's also a new music and health minor with this major!!! And, you automatically graduate with a psychology minor!!!\n\nIn 2016, a Berklee music therapy grad had the opportunity to conduct a music therapy session in the presence of President Obama at a veteran's hospital! Music therapy has been around since WW2, and there are thousands of peer-reviewed research articles describing and researching its efficacy for countless groups of people.\n\nHere are some music therapy videos that show music in action (and even have some of our faculty in them):\n\n[https://youtu.be/eqIijgUmvX8](https://youtu.be/eqIijgUmvX8)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtN59pJEMk4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtN59pJEMk4)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK5qqYYxjn4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK5qqYYxjn4)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNuT3x4KJsY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNuT3x4KJsY)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgsRxjZuSug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgsRxjZuSug)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlY4yCsGKXU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlY4yCsGKXU)",

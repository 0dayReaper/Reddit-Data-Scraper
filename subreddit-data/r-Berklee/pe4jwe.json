            "comment": "Hello.  The biggest concern is the structural condition of those fire escape railings.  These are very old buildings and with rain and snow can cause rusting to the metal. The railings might be painted but the weaknesses hidden. I'm not against enjoying sitting out on fire escapes. But, your safety is very important to your parents and the school as well.  If a bunch of students sit outside on them and the bolts and supporting hardware shear off or break it could be a really bad day. Don't risk it because you owe it to yourselves and your parents to stay safe. Sorry if I spoiled your plans.  I'm a Mechanical Design Engineer.",

    "postText": "Hi! I'm gonna start my undergraduate career on May and I'm a little bit of an anxious person when it comes to music DAWs... \n\nI love Ableton a lot and I've been wanting to buy the Standard license for a long time now. Since now I'm a student, I could use the 40% discount Ableton offers to Students &amp; Teachers but I fear buying it and then for courses reasons or something else having to use another DAW. I have planned to do my major in Professional Music; I'm a fretless bass player, I compose and produce music too, so this major seems to be the right one for what I want to keep on developing in my music career...\n\nBased on that, am I safe to buy Live or should I wait until the college tells me what DAW to use? Am I gonna end up using multiple DAWs maybe?\n\nThank you so much in advance,",

Here are the details from the site: https://www.berklee.edu/sts/core-software\n\nNow that I\u2019m rereading it, it does not appear to include Ableton. I was almost sure last fall\u2019s package included it, but I\u2019m a parent, not a student. I could have been imagining it though my son uses Ableton also. Just review the page and contact the technology office with any questions. They were pretty responsive when I emailed about M1 native applications.",

So you'd probably have to buy Ableton on your own but you could wait to get the Berklee discount. Also I don't recommend the pro music major. I think for you, CWP might be a better way to go but you should talk to the chairs of each major before you declare.",

            "comment": "You might want to find a backup. Many people who put down deposits for \u201cguaranteed\u201d housing in the fall didn\u2019t in fact get it, and they weren\u2019t even notified until about three weeks before move-in. My son wasn\u2019t one of them so I don\u2019t know exactly what happened to them, but from what I heard they were offered a terrible alternative. If you have a parent involved in your application you might want to have them join the Facebook Berklee parent group. It has a lot of good information. (I don\u2019t recommend bothering with the Berklee Off-Campus Housing group. It\u2019s full of either scams or of broker postings for apartments that undergraduates aren\u2019t eligible for \u2014 unless you\u2019re a graduate student, of course.)\n\nI also recommend that you find a tentative backup but don\u2019t sign or give deposits until you find out what is going on with the dorm. From what I read in the housing agreement, if you do happen to get a dorm assignment, you are contractually obligated for the entire semester\u2019s dorm cost whether you take it or not. You don\u2019t just lose the deposit. If Berklee fails to give you a dorm room then they\u2019ll release you from your obligations, but it\u2019s totally up to them. Now, if there is more demand than rooms they would logically let you out of the housing agreement to offer the placement to the next person, but be aware that again, it\u2019s up to them. \n\nI know that\u2019s tricky because if you find a good off-campus deal you\u2019ll want to jump on it, but you don\u2019t want to end up on the line for both leases. If you find a great alternative I\u2019d call the housing office and find out if they will let you out  of the housing agreement.",

Most evening events happen on or around campus so make sure you find a place within comfortable walking distance so you dont miss out on anything.\n\nIf you google, Berklee Off Campus Housing, you\u2019ll find a database from Berklee showing all the available apartments you can apply for.",

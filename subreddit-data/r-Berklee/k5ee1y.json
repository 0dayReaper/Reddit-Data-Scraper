    "postText": "Hi I'm from Germany and I want to apply for the bachelor in music film scoring. So I was wondering if there are some students in this subject who can share their experience with me. One question I have is what I have to do in the  candidature and the audition in film scoring. Do I have to send them a portfolio of my compositions or something else and is the audition process in film scoring? \n\n And how big is the chance to get a scholarship. I\u00b4m very experienced in producing music and composing. I also have produced some major Artist songs which was playing in the radio in Germany. I also was certified with an gold award for a song. I'm living alone with my mother, and we are getting financial aid so the costs for this school are very heavy for me. So maybe someone could give me some advice.   Thank you really much\n\nGreetings from Germany",

However, if you are entering for composition major related, they will definitely ask for your recent works and ask you to either perform it or show it. If you got any, feel free to demonstrate those works. There will be specific instructions (I assume) on how to show it to them as auditions are still most likely to be virtual. More detailed info on the audition process can be found through the Berklee website or feel free to email the school and they will be more than happy to help you out! (Just a warning though, it is final season so schools will be answering your emails slower than usual!)",

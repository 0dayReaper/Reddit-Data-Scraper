I\u2019d appreciate if some students could try to describe to me what their experience has been like. Specifically in terms of student body/social life, classes/professors, location.",

In mine there were about 20-30 transfer / international students. They gave us time to make friends and it was really helpful in getting a foot in the door and meeting people.\n\nThe rest of the stuff is pretty general college experiences -- make friends in your classes, join bands, try to network with your peers and professors, etc. Check previous comments in other threads in this sub and you'll see better advice than I could give here.",

Berklee is cliquey as it is, so I can\u2019t begin to imagine why the administration thought this program was a good idea. Accept at your own risk, but I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m not sure if Berklee is the right place for non-musicians.  \n  \nLocation is mid in a lot of respects but close to several subway lines, which is nice. Also relatively close to Fenway Park, Cambridge, the Public Garden/Common, &amp; Back Bay Station.  \n  \nClasses are generally unassuming until finals week ramps up. Professors tend to be reasonable.",

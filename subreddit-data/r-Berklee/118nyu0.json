    "postText": "Hello, community, I'm from Colombia, and I'm telling you about my situation. I graduated as a professional musician and it's been hard for me to work in my area. I'm planning to do a master's degree at Berklee, the master's degrees that catch my attention are music production and songwriting in New York and others They are in Spain. which are:\n\n\\-Music Production, Technology, and Innovation\n\n\\-Scoring for Film, Television, and Video Games\n\n\\-Master of Music in Contemporary Performance (Production Concentration)\n\nI would like to know your opinions or someone who has done some of these master's degrees with that suddenly there are more job opportunities and which of these has the best job prospects. I don't consider myself a bad musician but it has been difficult for me to integrate into the musical world of my country, I have thought about giving up music and starting a new career but I see this as a last possibility.",

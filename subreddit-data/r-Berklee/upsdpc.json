The study is exploring LGBTQ+ university students and their experiences in accessing and navigating sexual healthcare on college campuses. In order to participate, you must be a current university student in Boston, identify as LGBTQ+, and utilize sexual healthcare from services at your university or college. You may be eligible for compensation in the form of a $10 Amazon gift card for participating. Please fill out the Google Form if you are interested and email me at [scowan13@bu.edu](mailto:scowan13@bu.edu) with any questions.

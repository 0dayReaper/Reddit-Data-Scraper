    "postText": "Since English is my second language, there might be some grammar mistakes. \n\nI'm 15 years old and I'm currently learning about producing music using DAWs. I'm planning to take my audition a few years later and I wish to get into EPD major. I play piano and guitar; Piano is my primary instrument which I can play general songs without too much difficulties. Also I started to learn guitar just few months ago but I'm trying my best to learn fast. So my questions are...\n\nI want to take EPD audition. What should I prepare for this audition? Do I have to select an instrument to perform? I heard I have to bring my own songs made by me. I'm asking this because it's not like I'm going to major in certain instrument. \nOr do we just take audition and choose their majors after first semester?",

Yes, in audition (and in general) you need to have a primary instrument. My information might be old, but I don't think they've dropped those proficiency requirements. From my understanding, they've increased them. When I first started at Berklee there wasn't even an audition to get in, just to get your entry instrument numbers. If you're best at piano, you should probably do piano.",

            "comment": "Heyyo! Glad you considering Berklee. I am a third year at Berklee. From my current understanding is that you can bring your DAWs now and use that as your primary instrument to audition. I believe that the requirement is still the same. Feel free to ask any of the professor though as they can definitely provide more information to you!   \nAs for choosing majors, you will choose your intended major after you are accepted into Berklee. The majors that are on the list of choosing when you doing your audition is only for the judges to get an idea of what major you MIGHT be interested in and the standards are a bit different!",

I just finished my first year so I can help you out.\n\nYour major has nothing to do with you audition, but during the interview portion they\u2019ll ask what major you\u2019re thinking of doing. \n\nYou need to play on an instrument, if I were you I\u2019d pick piano. You must play a prepared piece (which is I believe 5 minutes maximum?). This does not have to be original, it can be any song. Pick one that showcases you best.\n\nYour principal instrument will be relevant for your first 4 semesters, all Berklee students have to take 4 semesters of Private Instruction and Ensemble courses, and 3 lab courses. These are all one credit each. Basically, your first 2 years include courses on your instrument, and your last 2 don\u2019t (unless you are a performance major).",

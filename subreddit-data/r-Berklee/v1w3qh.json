    "postText": "I have been considering going back to school and have been looking at Berklee Programs, as they offer a BA Interdisciplinary Music Studies (Create Your Own Major) Degree. I have heard mixed things about the program, and I already have a BS but in Digital Art. So I would like to go back to school, but I don't like how limited my choices are if I were to go for my masters. Does anyone have any advice or experience with Berklee Online? Thank you, much appreciated.",

The teachers are great and the learning is very good! \nOne thing that you need to be aware of: your learning and experience is very much on you. What I mean is; no matter how great the material and teachers are, your experience going through it is going to be a reflection of what you are putting into it.",

I recommend Berklee Online IF you don't have a good in-person option available and you can be motivated to work hard when you are working on your own online. I've seen people just doing the minimum to get a passing grade. You need to be committed to doing extra even when it doesn't result in a better grade. The live classes can be really valuable for certain classes. These will be scheduled based on US eastern time. If you can't attend any classes it might not be worthwhile to take certain classes",

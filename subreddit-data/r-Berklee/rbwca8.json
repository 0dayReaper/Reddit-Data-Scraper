I took last year summer semester online. \nHere's what I can tell you, some schools do summer semesters in 6 week sessions and they make them dense so you don't always want to take that many. But at berklee they are 12 weeks semesters which is only a few weeks shorter than the spring and fall 15 weeks. I personally liked the pacing, tho its fast so you gotta stay dedicated.",

And so if ur coming to berklee after the 5 week u may have be taking some courses with those professors and its a little easier",

    "postText": "Hey, everyone! I\u2019m Reana Kirzten, and I\u2019m going to be transferring to Berklee in the Fall.\n\nSome info about me. I\u2019m going to be majoring in either Electronic Production &amp; Design or Music Production &amp; Engineering. My principal instrument is voice, but I\u2019m also a multi-instrumentalist who can play piano, guitar, and ukulele as well.\n\nI prefer to live on campus for my first year at Berklee in 150 Massachusetts Avenue, and was wondering if anyone else is also looking for a roommate. If you are, feel free to send me a DM! ^_^\n\nMy main Instagram is @reanakirzten , and @reanakirzten.sings is my music Insta. For anyone who wants to check me out and my work, here\u2019s a link to my official card!\n\nhttps://reanakirzten.carrd.co/",

I feel that I have something different to offer in that Ive specialized in Indian classical music for over 8 years (I\u2019m 16) and I also go to an arts centred high school, which means I have experience in jazz choirs, a chamber choir, and western classical music as well. Would the fact that I\u2019m a vocalist still make it very difficult for me to earn a sizeable scholarship to Berklee?",

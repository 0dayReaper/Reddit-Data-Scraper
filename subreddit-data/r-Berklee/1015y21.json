    "postText": "Happy New Year\n\nSo I\u2019ll be starting my semester on campus in May hoping to declare my major in MP&amp;E. I currently run a studio in my town and offer digital mixing and mastering services for my clients and I was hoping to somehow continue this job when I arrive at Berklee. I plan on taking in less work and manage my time between work and studying - so it\u2019s possible I can handle the workload. Since I wont have access to my own studio, I was hoping to know If I\u2019m able to \u201crent\u201d their facilities to tackle 1-2 projects a day at least. All I really need is a pair of monitors and an acoustically treated room.\n\nGrateful for your help!",

            "comment": "Former MP&amp;E major here. Assuming things are the same in this respect, but when I was there you'd be able to book \"practice time\" online on a first come, first served basis (3 days in advance iirc). You're technically not supposed to work on projects you receive money for in Berklee studios, but I've never heard of this being enforced whatsoever. In other words, just don't snitch on yourself and you'll most likely be fine. Unless I'm mistaken, Berklee studios don't imprint an audio stamp that can identify that something was worked on in a Berklee studio \n\nSince studio time is so competitive, I'd recommend putting together the best setup you can at home so you can work on projects without booking being an issue. Can always get the mixes as best as you can there and then using the berklee rooms to check before sending anything off.\n\nHope this helps!",

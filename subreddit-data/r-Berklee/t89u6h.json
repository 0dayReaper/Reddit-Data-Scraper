    "postText": "I posted on here on the 1 month since my audition, in it I walked through the audition so if you want, you can read that to levy any possibilities. The issue is it\u2019s now been almost another month and I\u2019ve seen nothing back, they said I would only have to wait until the beginning of February and now it\u2019s March, so im very nervous and worried. Especially since my audition went as well as it did. Does anyone know what could be going on? I emailed the admissions office to follow up on a possible overlooking and I haven\u2019t gotten anything back, that was 2 days ago. Someone please help me out here!",

            "comment": "As already mentioned, Berklee is closed on the weekends and sometimes experiences other closures as well (holiday, weather etc) so sometimes responses are delayed. Not hearing back to an email inquiry within 2 days is totally normal. \n\nIf you\u2019ve been assigned an admissions advisor, be sure to follow up with them directly. Generally, don\u2019t duplicate messages - multiple emails to different parties within Admissions can cause delays. It\u2019s always better to reply to an existing thread and add a new party (ex the main admissions address on a thread with your advisor because you haven\u2019t heard anything from them for a few weeks) to the chain than to start a new email. \n\nReminder to be as courteous and proactive as possible in communication. From experience, it\u2019s much easier to reply to an email that states: \u2018wanted to check on the status of my application and check if there was anything else I can provide!\u2019 vs \u2018why haven\u2019t I received my decision yet, it\u2019s been a month and I haven\u2019t heard anything PLEASE REPLY.\u2019 All that to say, reminder that there\u2019s always another human on the other side!",

If its for Summer 2022 then that would be March 1st, in that case you should probably email them.  You said you emailed them 2 days ago about this, so about Friday.  From my experience with emailing Berklee Offices/Departments, they are usually always closed over the weekend and won't respond until Monday (or Tuesday).",

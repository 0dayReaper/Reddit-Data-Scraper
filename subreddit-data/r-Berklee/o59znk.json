            "comment": "It's funny that you posted this because I just called Berklee a couple days ago to get more details about their 5-week Aspire program. You don't even need to be particularly good at your instrument, you just need to have the money to attend and they'll likely take you lol (good news for me since I'm still practically a beginner at guitar).\n\nI've been researching about the program a lot, and I haven't seen anyone say anything negative about it. All the blog posts I've read from people who attended say it was a game-changing experience, and they all made lots of new friends. You learn from the best of the best, just like the regular students do. I'm sold on it and will be attending next year-- maybe I'll seeya there!",

I'm going to be 25 (ew) by next summer when I go, and I was worried that I'll be way older than everyone. I'd like to have some people to drink with haha.\n\nI'm glad to hear you're having a blast! I'd love to hear a synopsis of your experience so far!",

I learned so much in that week that helped me catapult my musical career. Having access to all of the gear, professors, performance venues etc really was awesome. Yeah it\u2019s really expensive but if you can afford it, it\u2019s absolutely worth it. when I was in the program I really felt like I was a berklee student.",

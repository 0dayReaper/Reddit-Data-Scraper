I did a Jazz Performance undergrad and I have decent experience composing for larger ensembles and a basic understanding of recording and music production.\n\nI wanted to see if anyone had any opinions on Berklee\u2019s online Film Scoring masters. Because it\u2019s new, I\u2019ve had a hard time finding any contacts who have taken it. It would be much more in my price range than any of the in-person programs, and TBH I\u2019m a little wary of what college will be like post-Covid. Some things I\u2019m worried that an online experience would lack: Access to gear and recording ensemble, making connections (I have plenty of connections in the music world, but I don\u2019t really know any film makers), and meaningful interaction with professors.\n\nThanks for any and all input!",

            "comment": "The undergrad film scoring students really struggled when Berklee transferred to online. They couldn't access the recording studios or other gear that really makes or breaks them. A huge part of film scoring is having the other students come to the studio and conducting your piece while recording it to the demo reel. It's a skill in itself that you won't get online.\n\nHonestly, the whole experience really sucked online. It was not the same and I don't think it was a substitute for in-person education. Music is very much an in-person thing.",

Their in person undergrad program is always rated as one of the best in the country, but I can't find anything about the online masters. Has anyone attended and what was your experience?",

I had a few friends who applied and got rejected and their rejection letter was the same as mine when I got rejected, the only difference was the name.  The only reason they gave, if I can remember, was there were a lot of strong applicants that year and they can't accept them all due to limited available seats for the entering class, so a lot of potential candidates were rejected.  Something along those lines.  Though I applied to other colleges before in the past and was rejected.  Their rejection letter was roughly similar to Berklee's rejection letter.  The only time that was different was when another friend of mine applied to Berklee and was rejected, he was told that he was missing a very important document which resulted in his rejection.  I'm not sure if this is true since I never saw his letter or the email with my own eyes.",

Something people don't take into consideration is that Berklee (and schools in general) care more about your ability to learn than your ability to play. They want to see that you will benefit here, not that you're the best. The acceptance rate varies yearly. The fall 2020 acceptance rate was in the 20's, but in years past its been as high as 33.",

It didn't make sense how the \"Julliard of Pop Music\" school could accept one out of every two who apply. Then I watched enough vids of students and grads and it began to make sense. If Berklee sees any hint of talent they will let you in, but then it comes down to cost. Most scholarships to Berklee don't rise above 10k per year, and that barely makes a dent at the 70k per year cost. So the yield rate is actually 30%. And many many students audition again and again and get accepted again and again, but don't actually go there til they get a large enough scholarship to make it worth while.",

They could have LOVED you, but they already knew they liked what they heard so they didn't need to hear more. Doesnt sound like its a good or bad thing. It just seems like they may have heard enough of your skill set to make a good observation",

I had two guitars, one for my prepared piece and one for everything else cause the piece was in a totally different tuning, so they asked if I was gonna use guitar 2 for it and I said no. I asked if I could continue and they said it\u2019s fine and that we could move on.",

I think I goofed up on improv and some of the sing/play back portion, but did well in chords, scales and sight reading. I thought of the audition as a placement test sort of thing after the prepared piece.\n\nI did guitar, cause I\u2019ve been on it the longest, but I mentioned I played other instruments in the interview.\n\nIf you want, you can get some prerequisites done at a cheaper college, That is what I am currently doing because...money. Even in the interview when I told them that I was a community college freshman, they told me that I was being smart with getting prerequisites done with. I would only do one year however because they only accept 24 credits, and have very specific requirements.\n\nFeel free to message me if you have any other questions :) .",

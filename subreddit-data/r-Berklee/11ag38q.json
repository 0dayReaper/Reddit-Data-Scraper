    "postText": "I\u2019ll be starting my semester in May and hoping to eventually claim my major in MP&amp;E, Film Scoring, or Business (we\u2019ll see). My principle instrument is EDI so I will most likely be carrying an Ableton Push controller (size is about 15\u201d by 12\u201d and weighs 6.6 pounds) and maybe some other gear either in a carrying case or in my backpack. I\u2019m used to 15\u201d macs screen size so I\u2019d prefer to work on a 16\u201d if possible, but might have to sacrifice size if I have to carry a lot on a daily basis. Also the bigger screen is better because I don\u2019t have to bring in a monitor for my dorm.\n\n- Do certain classes require you to bring textbooks? Or is everything in a binder?\n- How big are the textbooks generally? Are they usually heavy or do they vary in size based on the classes/major?\n- Can you bring your iPad to class to take notes, and if so, would you still need to bring your laptop in to class every time? \n- How much do you carry every day?",

            "comment": "Welcome, welcome! I\u2019m not any of those majors, but here\u2019s what I can tell you from my experience:\n\n1. Yes, certain classes will require that you purchase a textbook - usually, these aren\u2019t traditional, hard-cover books, but a stack of hole-punched paper that you\u2019ll need to put in a binder. That said, if you ask around, you can usually find scanned copies in PDF format. \n\n2. I definitely recommend getting an iPad, but know that the use of technology in a given class is at the professor\u2019s discretion. Most professors won\u2019t care how you do things, but some are militantly against academic technology. Check RateMyProfessor, or ask around to see which professors have this policy. \n\n3. How much you carry depends on your living situation. If you\u2019re in one of the on-campus dorms, particularly 150 or 160, you can probably get away with just what you\u2019ll need for one or two classes, and stop by your room in the meantime. If you\u2019re off-campus and commuting however, you\u2019ll probably want to pack heavier, with everything you\u2019ll need for the day.\n\n4. For your first semester, a MIDI controller probably won\u2019t be necessary for your classes. Per your laptop, I use a 16\u201d daily; it takes up the whole desk, but still works great, and tbh I love the big screen. With that and point 3 in mind, definitely consider getting a larger backpack.",

They're pretty small; look up \"music posture chair with desk\" and you'll know what I'm talking about. If you're living on-campus, the desks are actually pretty big!\n\nIn terms of binders, a 1-1.5\" binder will do for most textbooks, but if I'm being honest, I've just done everything digitally from my iPad (I cannot stress the app Notability enough!).",

Speaking from experience, especially as a piano principle, you'll probably want to put a MIDI controller on a stand to the side of your desk, and play it that way. They're spacious, but likely not enough to run a whole mini-studio.",

I worked for months on my audition piece because it involved a kind of complicated medley with Ableton Live and stuff like that.\n\nI would say: try to be yourself, play what you really like and are passionate about. The auditions are pretty subjective and sometimes allowing them to see your personality and special taste can help you a lot. If you are passionate about misty, that seems like a great choice to me, and the judges will love it :)\n\nFeel free to DM me if you have more questions or want to ask me anything.",

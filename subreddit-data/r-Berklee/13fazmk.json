            "comment": "Ask everyone you meet for their recommendations about professors and classes! With core classes like Ear Training and Harmony, there are a lot of teachers - and some are definitely better than others. I relied on friends a few semesters ahead to recommend their favorites, so I ended up with great teachers throughout, but definitely heard some horror stories from friends who just picked based off of schedule. \n\nAnd generally, stay open-minded and consider taking labs or classes that are outside of your current wheelhouse! I was a vocal principal and had never really played much percussion before, but took a Brazilian hand percussion lab for fun... then took Afro-Cuban, Mediterranean, and Native American percussion labs too. Now I (among other things) teach with a music ed organization that is focused on percussion &amp; rhythms from around the world. I also took a couple of vocal labs that were unlike anything I'd sung before (Eastern Vocal Styles, Berklee Indian Ensemble in its second semester! Such an incredible experience) that ended up really informing my graduate studies and the international performance opportunities that I've had since leaving Berklee. Pursue your interests, but don't box yourself in! The best thing about Berklee is how many different styles of music you can deeply explore and the amazing community of musicians, both teachers &amp; your peers - take advantage of that. Good luck!",

It has helped me connect with more people and stay prepared for sure, but I was looking for some advice from current students based on their experiences in first/second semester. Any tips regarding time management, studying/practicing, networking, etc?\n\nAlso would you mind sharing the other communities you\u2019re talking about beside the discord server? Grateful.",

Networking is the most important thing at Berklee. You would not believe how much connections I\u2019ve made thanks to Berklee. \n\nAlso, Berklee is extremely easy to have a high GPA, which is helpful when you\u2019re looking for your first job or applying to Grad school. Don\u2019t skip class and do all the assignments and it\u2019ll be a guaranteed A most of the time.",

I did the 5 week program last year and I made some friends I still talk to and even hang out with. \n\nRegarding majors, I\u2019m pretty set on MP&amp;E, but I do want to double major and definitely need to see which other one I\u2019d benefit from. Maybe EPD, business, or film scoring. We will see. \n\nWhat did you major in?",

I actually met more people through MP&amp;E than the business major. Also it\u2019s more competitive cause it\u2019s the only major, other than EPD, that you have to apply for.",

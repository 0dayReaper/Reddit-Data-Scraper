    "postText": "My younger got into Berklee in Boston. I'm really proud of him and want to help him out. He doesn't have a reddit.\nI was wondering what are some good options off campus\n\nI got to sac state and we had a lot of student off campus apartments that matched us up with roommates. I was wondering if there was anything like that there or just any other good options for apartments. What's a way most people find roommates if they don't know anyone there?\n\nHow does the price for on campus compare to off? Ik there's pros and cons to both. Unfortunately money is an issue for us so knowing how costs compare would be nice.\n\nMy bro has type one diabetes so he needs a roommate in case of emergencies (although unlikely however it never hurts to be careful)\n\nAny advice would help. We've done some research on apartments but having some inside input would be really helpful \ud83d\ude0a",

            "comment": "Unfortunately Berklee doesn't help with off campus housing, to my knowledge at least, but there's plenty of apartments around campus so finding one won't be too much of a problem. \n\nIt is definitely cheaper to stay off campus. I'm going to be living off campus with two roommates, personally paying around $950 a month. The place is about a 5 minute walk from Berklee. When I was living off campus, the housing and meal plan was roughly $9,500 roughly per semester, so for approximately 8 months that's over $2000 dollars a month, and we weren't even allowed to stay over winter break. Obviously since that includes a meal plan it's not 100% comparable but it's a rough idea of the difference in cost. Also depending on the on campus building, the walk to class could be 10-15 minutes, compared to 5 minutes from my apartment off campus. \n\nAs for finding a roommate, I found mine in a Snapchat groupchat. I recommend joining every  group possible, even if your brother isn't very active on social media. I almost never said anything in groupchats but I still managed to find my roommate through one. There's also a discord server for Berklee and one specifically for the class of 2024, as well as an Instagram for incoming students to introduce themselves. There's probably a facebook group as well, and in my experience there's always people trying to form new Snap groups from the Facebook group.\n\nCongrats to your brother and good luck!",

Teknoljii. \n\nIf you're happy with yours then why, and if you're not happy with yours then why not and also rip lol. \n\nCheers future helperouters",

When you say you're usually plugging into a monitor, is that your own one that you have in the dorms or wherever you're living, or are there monitors and stuff around Berklee that you end up using? I probably won't have a monitor cus ill be in dorms so idk if that comes into consideration. Forgive my raw noobness in these questions.",

I read (admittedly on a random YouTube comment) that Logic couldn't handle lots of third party plugins with whatever spec they had, so would it be worth spending a few more bucks to get more RAM or whatever or should I leave it and get an external drive or something in future? tenks",

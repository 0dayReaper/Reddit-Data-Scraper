    "postText": "Hi all.\n\nI'm a student from India and this is the second time i've applied to berklee. I wanted to audition in Bangkok, Thailand and applied early action. Back in October, I specifically wrote to the auditions team that I wanted my audition to be on the 4th of Dec (as it says on the website) since I was giving the SAT on the 3rd. They said they'd make a note of it.\n\nAbout 2 weeks into November I get the audition confirmation. Turns out tho, I can't see my confirmation because the portal is bugged. Atp, I've booked my tickets to Thailand for the 4th because the prices were hiking. I emailed them a lot of times, and even tried calling the auditions team twice, but no response. The funny part is, the admissions office picked up my call but they couldn't reach the auditions team either. Lol. \n\nOn the 23rd, about 10 days before my audition, they finally fix their website and I can see my audition confirmation. But, surprise, surprise! My date is scheduled for the 3rd. I email them again asking them to change it, even mentioning the mail which said they'd take my request into account.\n\nFinal nail in the coffin- today as i write this post, they respond saying they've CANCELLED the event on the 4th due to a lack of a demand. Really disappointed and annoyed at how they've managed things. Funnily enough, their website still shows Thailand as an audition location for the 4th. \n\nIf they had a big warning on their locations page stating that the dates were subject to change and cancellations, I wouldn't have booked my flights in the first place. Now they're telling me to go for an online option, which just defeats the entire purpose of wanting an in person audition. Anyway, thanks for reading my rant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Berklee's terrible organization and lack of communication made me lose a bunch of money.",

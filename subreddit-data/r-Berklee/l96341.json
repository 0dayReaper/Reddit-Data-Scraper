    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI recently got my decision from Berklee and was provisionally accepted.  I'm currently attending another college so I would be transferring into Berklee.  I have no problems with the requirements I have to fulfill during their Summer Semester program.\n\nThe only major problem on the letter that's really making me hesitant on accepting the offer is this sentence, \"Please note that candidates who receive this admissions decision are not eligible for institutional scholarship or grant aid from Berklee.\" I did thought that they will give me my scholarship decision, with the amount based on how well I did over the summer program, but I feel like that's not the case.\n\nDoes this mean that I will not receive any financial aid from Berklee, scholarship from doing the audition/interview, etc.  What about FAFSA?  (I completed and submitted my FAFSA back in early December-ish).\n\nThanks!",

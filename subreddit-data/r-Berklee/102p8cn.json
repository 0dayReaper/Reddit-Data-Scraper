            "comment": "Berklee is set up like a traditional music school. That means you need to audition on an instrument or voice. You have to have a level of proficiency that is pre-professional. If you are applying as a singer, you might have a tougher time, because Berklee has a surplus of singers with little prior vocal training. Because Berklee gives out bachelor of music degrees, there are a lot of very difficult music classes like your training in music theory that you would have to take in addition to production, songwriting etc. you need to figure out if this is both what you\u2019re interested in and something you\u2019re willing to pay for. You might be a better candidate for a pure music business degree out of school like Middle Tennessee State or Belmont where there is no audition.",

I would look into the core music curriculum, as well as the courses that you would need to take for your intended major. If you still think that Berklee is the right path for you, I would look in to taking some voice lessons. That is if you intend to audition as a singer. Also, there is an instrumental track called EDI, which I think stands for electronic digital instrument. That is for people who are purely producers and are very talented with their daw. If you\u2019re interested in that, I would check more on the website. Good luck!",

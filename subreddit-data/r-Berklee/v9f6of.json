If your living in the dorms theres not a ton of space to keep a drumset but there are lockers you can rent. If your driving and live in new england its a low risk decision but if your shipping drums you may want to hold off until you have your own place\n\nIm a 7th semester lmk if u have any other questions i was completely clueless when i started and would love to pass on the info ive learned",

Even if you end up with a circumstance inwhich your in need of a drumset off campus a lot of kids who live more locally have kits and you can borrow something. My roomate brought a kit our first semester and it took up a ton of room in the dorm and didnt get used as much as it does now in our basement off campus. The drum dept has facilities that you book through berklee (theyll explain at orientation) so you can schedule time to practice solo; the same thing applies for band practices/ensambles there are kits in most spaces you would be playing in",

    "postText": "Well, my daughter got the dredded \"rejection\" letter today. Needless to say, we are stunned... No explanation, just \"sorry, you have not been accepted\". The reason we are so floored is because...\n\n1. She received a $3,000 scholarship to 5-week last summer for Bass Guitar. Didn't audition for undergrad at 5-week because she didn't know its what she wanted until after 5-week.\n2. She was placed in 5 ensembles during 5-week and was praised by all her instructors and band mates.\n3. She got all A's and one B in her 5-week classes with comments on her pottential to succeed at Berklee.\n4. She auditioned early November in  NYC for early action.\n5. Audition went great! Interview was smooth and felt good. Prepared piece was Goodbye Angels by RHCP and she played it perfectly. Was asked to sight read a bunch of stuff and did 100%. Was asked to play different styles and create bass lines and did everything as asked perfectly. Ear training 100%.\n\nShe was so confidant leaving the audition becasue she had no flaws in the audition. We thought for sure she would not only get an accepence, but were prepared for a nice scholarship package... But instead we got a REJECTION form letter with no explanation at all...\n\nCAN ANYONE give us insight on what may have gone wrong or what could have been done differently??? \n\nShe is considering applying for 5-week again, and auditioning while there this time... It just hurts.",

They are only accepting so many people per year, and maybe for bass players more people did more things \u201cright\u201d than normal. \n\nOn the upside, Berklee is hellishly expensive and the ROI is pretty low in reality. Maybe she dodged a bullet? I often wish I hadn\u2019t gone",

Speaking as someone who did my Bachelors at Berklee and my Masters at a state school, there are lots of other places to get a great music education. \n\nI had a blast at Berklee but I actually think the experience I got at a state school was better. The music program was much smaller, but because of that it is much more tight knit. Professors didn't have a hundred bass players to keep track of so they were actually very individually involved in their student's education and job hunt afterwards.\n\nAt the end of the day a B.M. in Music Ed from Berklee is the same as a B.M. in Music Ed from anywhere else, one just costs a lot more.",

I would also look at University of North Texas and UCLA.\n\nActually the best thing to do is google the university and find the page for their music program. They should have profiles on all of their ensembles, professors, and staff and a degree coarse plan that you can download. Those professors and bands probably have content on youtube you can look up and watch them play. A little research will go a long way.",

            "comment": "Rejection always sucks, but it's also a part of life. You are never going to know the real reason. I've been on admissions committees for other schools and it truly is hard to make a decision. Many factors come into play like balancing out the cohort. So many people are highly qualified. Rejection is only dangerous if it stops your daughter from trying and going after the things she wants in life. I made this [video](https://youtu.be/xv-gW7WuOzI) on strategies for coping with rejection. It's about grad school, but the strategies still apply. Once you all feel your feelings and the grief of letting the possibility of going to Berklee go, reframe your mental model to focus on what you all gained from this experience. Rejection is often the biggest teacher. I can feel that you care deeply about your daughter, and you likely are feeling her pain equally or maybe even more, so take some time to process and feel your feelings.",

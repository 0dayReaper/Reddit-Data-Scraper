    "postText": "I am a 25 year old incoming student. I already have a bachelors degree and know how much works is required to achieve a college degree. I already practice 3 hours/day but plan on upping this to 5-6/day. As you you can tell I am super serious about berklee and about my instrument, but I am not the most social person. I will also be older than many of the other incoming students. Do you think someone in my situation should live in the dorms or try to find off campus housing?",

Even though we were only a couple of years apart we were worlds apart in maturity and life goals. They were nice enough I guess but if I could go back in time I would have found an off-campus apartment. \n\nALSO I turned 21 in November of my first-year at Berklee and all the kids on my floor were constantly asking me to buy them alcohol or to borrow my ID. It was awful. RUN AWAY",

They never responded so maybe they were being strict about the graduate student requirement. Don\u2019t want to tag them but their username is LozengeLagoon; maybe you can look up the post if you\u2019re interested. \n\nMy son is still debating this choice also, and we\u2019re at the deadline today for guaranteed housing for incoming students. He is a 21 year old transfer and has had two years of his own room so he doesn\u2019t want to room with an 18 year old who\u2019s away from home for the first time. Add to that the fact that they have triples and even quads in some dorms, and he\u2019s imagining a worst-case scenario of *three* freshmen roommates.\n\nIf for any reason you might be interested in either rooming with someone like my son in the dorms (he and you can request a particular roommate) or finding someone to get an apartment with, let me know sometime today before we sign the housing agreement. He pretty much just wants someone who minds their own business, which sounds like what you might want. I can PM you his phone number at that point.",

            "comment": "If money is an issue, off campus housing is way cheaper. Also when I was there they made you buy the meal plan if you\u2019re living in the dorms which is also pretty expensive. You do meet a lot of people in the dorms, but Berklee is basically one big networking cesspool so I really don\u2019t foresee you having issues with meeting people either way, especially if you play in a lot of ensembles. The dorms do have a big upside where some (or all?? I can\u2019t remember) give you 24/7 access to a practice room (without a piano though). The practice room situation when I was there for off campus students was a bit more difficult to get one, though it also depends on your instrument and major.  Personally I preferred living off campus verses the dorms, but I had already made friends by the time I was off campus so it was a little different.",

If you test into the upper semesters or skip core music training entirely (u seem to have core music experience) then you'll probably meet a lot of older students. \n\nOff campus housing is WAY MORE affordable and you can network pretty well in my opinion. Plenty of friends I made who live on campus didn't really use their time well when it came to socialising even when they were at the dorms (their words). I think that everyone will be a little nervous and figuring the Berklee thing out the 1st 2 semesters so the dorms may not necessarily benefit everyone.",

Networking is one of the biggest advantages Berklee can give you, and you should make as many friends as possible. You\u2019ll all have a shared interest in music so it\u2019ll be easier than you think. \n\nAfter that semester it\u2019s up to you, but it\u2019s way easier to meet people when you\u2019re living together. I lived in a dorm first semester, then off campus the following ones bc it was cheaper.",

    "postText": "I am a multi instrumentalist and a junior in high school right now and I am applying early action at Berklee in September with drumset percussion as my applied instrument. I am somewhat unnerved about the audition, and my plan is to spend my summer time practicing upwards of 4 hours a day, preparing myself for the audition with my drum teacher (who\u2019s an alumni). I really am conflicted about what I wanted to do for my prepared piece. I wouldn\u2019t say I am good enough of a jazz musician to call myself jazz trained, neither is it my main playing style. I want to be truthful about my goals while still highlighting my technical skill and ability to prepare a piece. My main genres are rock, funk, and reggae. my current setup consists of a snare, 2 rack toms, a floor tom, a bass drum, 2 crashes, a ride, and a hi hat. This has been my dream school since the eighth grade, please help me out!!",

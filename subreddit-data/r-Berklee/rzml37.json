            "comment": "I am a current Berklee student and prospective songwriting major. I auditioned last March with an original song. I think it really comes down to what you want to show off. You are auditioning on an instrument, but as a writer you want to show off your skills there since not everybody can write original music. The bottom line is that you should go with your gut and do what makes you feel good. If you do choose to do an original song don\u2019t be afraid to do some revision and ask for feedback from a teacher or someone you trust. Also, try to take into account whether the piece shows off your talent on your instrument. Feel free to reach out with any other questions. Good luck!",

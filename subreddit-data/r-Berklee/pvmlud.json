    "postText": "Hey Berklee peeps! Emerson College Film student here. I'm currently a senior involved in the student-run organization, '**Beat Dynamics**'\u2014**we film music videos for solo artists** **and bands around the Greater Boston area** (everything's on a gratis basis, we just want to collaborate with other creators). As of now I myself am in need of artists (or groups) to feature in said music video productions for this semester. The dates of when production would start for us are still up in the air right now, but we'll be getting a much better idea about what the deal is surrounding scheduling very soon. **Let me know ASAP if you'd be interested, or know someone who's been trying to record a video for any songs they've created!** **Thank you!**",

I was wondering how i would get a scholarship like what do they look for and what would i have to do to prepare myself. i know when i\u2019m competing with other extremely talented guitar players it would be quite difficult.",

            "comment": "Fellow guitarist here, Berklee seems to give quite a bit of money away, I\u2019ve heard about 40% of kids get some kind of scholarship. I got a partial scholarship of 8k/year as long as I keep my grades up and I auditioned with Gardens by Julian Lage, which I chose because it\u2019s an instrumental piece that demonstrates some pretty difficult stuff, but I was confident with it. It\u2019s definitely not uncommon for someone to get some kind of money, I know quite a few kids who actually got a full ride. My advice is, audition with something you\u2019re really confident with and depending on your style, I\u2019d choose something instrumental since it lets you take control of all aspects in the piece. Also, practice sight reading, you don\u2019t need to be an expert, but it will really help if you can show you have an understanding of it. I have to read/notate music for almost all my classes and it\u2019s something I regret not practicing much beforehand. Also you should be prepared to demonstrate an understanding of basic 4 part chords and major/minor scales. They\u2019ll most likely give you some kind of ear training exercise so it helps to practice that as well. So to answer your question, it\u2019s not very difficult to get a scholarship at Berklee, just make sure you choose the right piece for you, practice sight reading, have an understanding of theory and harmony, and just check out the requirements for auditions. I think you can find a list on their website. Anyways, good luck and follow your dreams!!",

            "comment": "I got a pretty solid scholarship, and I'm fully convinced that it was due to my performance on the ear training portion of the audition, since my performance piece was nothing special. I'm not sure if the process has changed, but what I remember is:\n\n\\- They give you a tonic\n\n\\- They play short phrases (turned around so you can't see their fingers) and ask you to play them back\n\n\\- The phrases begin very simple - tonic note only in different rhythms, then introducing melodic ideas of increasing complexity until you fail. I suspect they do not expect very many students to do well on this since most students test directly into ear training 1 during entrance exams. They had a noticeable surprised/pleased reaction to my test.\n\nSo my recommendation is to practice your melodic and rhythmic ear training. Fyi I do not recall any harmonic ear training component on the audition.\n\nAlso, regardless of your style of choice, Berklee is known to have a jazz bias. Consider learning a jazz arrangement for your performance piece. If you transcribe someone else's arrangement or solo so they can read along your transcription while you play they will also love that, since that's a common way that guitar proficiency exams are conducted within the college. Best of luck!",

            "comment": "Especially for guitarists (and vocalists), if you have to ask the question then you'll probably not get it - at least for the full scholarship.\n\nWhen I was there in the early 2000's is was like 1% of folks who had a full scholarship (if that).\n\nIt is incredibly hard to stand out a guitarist at Berklee.\n\nWhile people trip all over her these days, let's say that St Vincent did *not* get a full ride there (we used to hang out in the short time she was there). Are you a better guitarist than her?\n\nAlso, maybe things have changed. Back 20 years ago, it was nearly impossible to stand out as a guitarist there enough to merit a full scholarship.",

    "postText": "Hi! My audition for Berklee is next Saturday and I\u2019m really nervous/excited. My main instrument is the piano, and I\u2019ve been preparing for about a year and a half now. It\u2019s my dream school. I still have a lot to work on as many concepts are still new to me such as improvisation, how to play jazz/blues and all that god stuff. I just wanted to know how others remote audition was!! I\u2019m mostly nervous for the improvisation. Did they ask you what key you were most comfortable in?? Also, how was the sight reading for the piano? Was it difficult??\nThank you for taking the time to read :D",

I had my audition exactly two months ago, so I'd imagine our experiences will be similar.\n\nIf you haven't taken a look at Berklee's [exercises page](https://www.berklee.edu/admissions/undergraduate/practiceexercises), absolutely do! The people running my audition gave me a choice to solo over whichever exercise I wanted over the entire page. The sight-reading also wasn't so bad; it was pretty fair but did get progressively more difficult as you'd expect. If you have time with your private instructor (if you have one!), definitely go over. They'll screen-share the PDF of the music for you.\n\nHope this helps, and good luck! Hopefully I'll see you! :)",

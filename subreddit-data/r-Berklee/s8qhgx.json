    "postText": "My son is a junior in high school and has been involved with his school bands since 7th grade. He wants to pursue a career in music, namely music scores for soundtracks for film, and video games. He plays the oboe, clairnet, and now percussion. He also taught himself to play the keyboard. \n\nBesides the obvious, do you think Berklee online differs greatly from Berklee? In what ways?",

            "comment": "Berklee grad here ('09)!\n\nIn short, it differs the most in terms of the opportunities he'd be able to have by going in-person vs. taking classes online, and consider that an umbrella for a myriad of things like jam sessions, campus life, interfacing with instructors, living in Boston and such.\n\nEven though I don't always recommend Berklee (the cost alone makes it hard to recommend, as well as what you get out of it in the end since that very much varies on how much effort you put in), the major thing that you really get out of going to Berklee is the experience of actually being *there*.\n\nBerklee Online has its merits (I've taken a couple courses when I was thinking I'd get my MBA, but that was nearly a decade ago now).  I think it gives you a lot of the elements of Berklee's core curriculum (theory is theory is theory), but not the intangible stuff you get with experiencing something in-person.  I would also say, considering what your son is interested in (scoring, creating music for film/video games), Berklee Online is not the way to go and he'd vastly benefit from going to Berklee vs. the online route.\n\nFeel free to follow up with any questions and take it with a caveat that I have no recent experience with Berklee Online, so not sure how it is today (it could be better - and I hope it is! - than it was in its infancy).",

You're not going to play in a 10 piece ensemble over Zoom.\n\nHarvard Extension School online is not the same as going to Harvard. MIT courses via EdX aren't the same as going to MIT. And Berklee Online is a useful tool, but definitely not 10% of going to Berklee.",

I can assure you that the above posts are correct. I also have no experiences with Berklee online. But, even more than with a traditional school or program, Berklee is about the experience, interaction, networking, etc. What you will learn online will be fantastic and valuable, (I'd love to take some online course myself!) but it won't be \"Berklee\".",

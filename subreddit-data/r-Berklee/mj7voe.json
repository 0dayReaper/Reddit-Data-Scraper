    "postText": "Hi everyone. I learned that I got into Berklee last week with a 23,000 dollars merit scholarship. However, it only covers half of the tuition. I'm a low-income international student, and because of the dollar exchange rate in my country, it is impossible to pay the rest of the tuition + housing and books, and all of the other costs for my family. Also, there are no sponsors or government funds in my country, and I can't get any loans as well. Berklee has been my dream school for the past couple years. I want to major in film scoring and Berklee is the only place that offers an undergrad degree in film scoring. I HAVE to go there. But I can't afford it. I filed an appeal, but on the website, it states that they don't give need-based aid to entering international students. Does this mean my appeal won't be considered or they're going to reject it? Does this mean they only accept \"wealthy\" international students? If you have a suggestion on what I can do please share. I desperately need help. I saw another thread below. Someone said that they got a full-tuition scholarship and were eligible for getting the presidential one, which made me feel worse about myself and my music skills. I feel like if I were good enough I would be able to get a full-tuition one and would be able to attend Berklee.\n\nWhat should I do? If you can give any suggestion you would make me very happy.\n\nThank you.",

It\u2019s a great place, but what information does it have you can\u2019t get right now? You might be surprised how much is available through self-study, it\u2019ll only make you better!\n\nGood luck!",

I know the Berklee Global Partner Schools, but I don't know if my scholarship will continue to be valid after I return to the Boston campus, or whether if I will have to go through the Berklee admission process again to return to Boston. And also, what do you mean by reauditioning? Can I appeal for a reaudition even if I am an admitted student?",

You will reapply after your time at the partner schhool, which would enable a new scholarship amount.\n\nBy reauditioning, I meant not accepting the offer and applying again after more practice/self study. I don\u2019t believe you can reaudition during your current acceptance, and with all respect, things would be unlikely to change given the lack of time you\u2019d have to practice in a short timeframe.",

Unless the school\u2019s a global partner, it\u2019s unlikely any music credits will transfer, the best bet is always emailing the transfer credit office.\n\nA lot of people go to Community Colleges to complete there Liberal Arts (general education) classes, that can save a lot of money. Other options are Berklee Online and CLEP tests.",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t think that scholarships define the value of your musicianship... I received a full tuition scholarship but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m better than anyone else because of that. I have met plenty of people that I think deserved it much more than me or that basically have the same musical skills that I have and yet they did not receive the scholarship that I received. It is basically the judges at your audition that decide what they are rating you and the scholarships are based on your rating. My boyfriend audition for Berklee too, he is an incredible pianist and he got the same scholarship you got. In my mind, I am in no way better than him... I just think I got lucky and that the judges liked my voice and the jazz pieces I played. It depends of so many factors. You are good enough to go to Berklee, this has NOTHING to do! Keep in my mind that they only give 15 full scholarships... and most of them are for Americans. It is incredibly difficult to get one! I never thought I would! Try applying to other scholarships in the us, or in your country, or try reauditioning. 23 000$ us is very good, you should be proud of yourself, most of my friends scored less than 10 000$ and they are really good, so don\u2019t beat yourself up.",

The bad thing about this is that I'll feel like I wasted my 23K scholarship, and there's no guarantee that I'll get it again when I'll try to transfer. But regardless, I hope I can be a Berklee alumni in the future!",

Berklee is an insanely expensive school, I'm sorry to say! And the US Government rules, don't make it easier - you have to show that you can afford the tuition before they grant you the visa.",

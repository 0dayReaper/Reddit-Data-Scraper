    "postText": "So you got into Berklee. You are excited. Here's my advice:\n\nMeet people, collaborate. Don't focus so much on your grades.. sure, it's important, but nobody cares about it after Berklee. Make friends. Literally friends are more important than your grades. The music industry is a people's business. If you think after Berklee somebody will hire you because you are good, you are wrong. They'll hire you because they like you as a friend or person and because you might be good at what you do as well. Nobody is gonna hire you cause \"hey I heard this person was a good Berklee student and plays/writes/records great\".\n\nAlso, this is college. The best years of your life. Go to parties.. get drunk. Start a band. Play live. Do it all. It's not about graduating with good grades; it's about the experience. You won't remember the classes.. god I swear I graduated in 2014 and it hasn't even been that long and I already forgot some of the classes I took haha... But you know what haven't I forgotten? The moments with friends.. the jams, parties, talks, band practices. Human interaction.\n\nYou have to make an effort to make friends. Meet your classmates. Go for a coffee with them. Talk. Meet every one of them. Trust me. I experienced both sides of Berklee. I experienced the lonely antisocial guy in the studio that goes to class and once it's over goes back home fast or to meet up with his close group of friends.. and I also experienced the one in which you meet a lot of people and connect and socialize. The last one is better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nENJOY!",

            "comment": "I have to agree with all of this.\n\nAdding some more advice: be careful. Drink and smoke and have fun, but be careful. I know someone that was kicked out of school for OD\u2019ing during his first week. Don\u2019t be dumb about it.  \n\nTalk to everyone. It sounds like an introverts nightmare, so do whatever self care you need, but connect with everyone you can and be kind to them. This is how you make connections and get jobs.\n\nBe kind to your professors and they will (usually) be kind to you. Even if you\u2019re struggling in the class, if you connect with the professor, they will be able to help you and they will be more likely to grade more leniently. \n\nDon\u2019t compare yourself. It\u2019s the hardest thing in the world, but it\u2019s so important. Try to keep your love for music. \n\nThe name Berklee isn\u2019t what\u2019s going to get you places when you leave the school. It\u2019s the people you connected with and the things your learned. I was a music therapy major and that was still true for me. A professor of mine is now a close colleague, and he just recommended me for a teaching job. \n\nGood luck, it\u2019s a great school in a great city.",

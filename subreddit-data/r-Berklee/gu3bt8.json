    "postText": "Hey folks, I'm seriously considering attending Berklee Online for music production. I have been a musician for 8 years and I've been mixing for 3 years. I feel that I am ready to learn mixing and production techniques at Berklee. I'm curious if anyone has any insight they can share into life after Berklee online? Have you been able to make any significant connections? Have you gotten work directly because of your degree? How was your experience with the program itself? \nThanks so much!",

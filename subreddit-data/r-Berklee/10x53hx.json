I even took work off the day before to rest and prepare, but when I got here today after a 3 hour trip they said there must've been an error. Turns out it was a system error and they gave me the wrong date. They had to reschedule for a couple weeks out, which isn't the biggest deal and gives me more time to prepare. I'm just emotionally exhausted from this rollercoaster \ud83d\ude14.",

I kinda wish this happened to me because I auditioned while I was in the summer program at Boston and I only had a few days to prepare. I got in anyways so I\u2019m good. Just could\u2019ve done better for the scholarship.",

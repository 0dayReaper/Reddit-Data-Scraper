    "postText": "So for my audition I chose \u201crude mood\u201d by Stevie Ray Vaughan. I essentially played it note for not but added some chicken Pickin\u2019 licks because I\u2019m from Nashville. I love Stevie and have been playing Stevie for years and even played in a Stevie ray vaughan cover band for a bit. Here\u2019s a link to the song, https://youtu.be/p2q0NXIL6m0 I just wanted to chose a song that reflected me as a player, for the audition I played pretty much that whole form note for note with some added hyper fast blues licks and some southern twang for style. Thoughts? I\u2019m still waiting for a letter and so I\u2019ve just been thinking about what I played, that\u2019s all. Thanks!",

            "comment": "this sounds like a great audition song! i think that the most important thing when picking a song is, like you said, it reflects you as a musician and your passion shows when you\u2019re playing it. adding some of your own licks and style only adds points. I made a violin concerto style arrangement of \u2018lovely\u2019 by billie eilish and got in, so really anything goes!",

    "postText": "Has anyone else been accepted into the Contemporary Performance Masters degree in Valencia, or any masters degree in Valencia for that matter? \n\nJust wondering where everyone else is at with their decision process after receiving the most recent email from admissions stating that they are not allowing us to defer our admission decision to next year, that the deposit is non-refundable, and that they're looking into going online for the fall. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis program seems like a dream come true but is anyone else not particularly excited about doing a portion of their performance degree online? Can anyone in a Berklee masters right now weigh in on your current experience?",

    "postText": "Hello everyone, I just wanted to ask what the leading thoughts are around about AI and what that means for the industry. \n\nI plan on applying soon for school but find myself questioning the decision. Will humans even have a job in the space besides live performance in a decade? \n\nWill AI automate mixing and mastering completely as well as the creative writing process? \n\nI hope I\u2019m wrong but the future I see isn\u2019t looking good for musicians. Do you see a point where the musician is obsolete? When people can ask their personal AI assistants to create an unheard playlist of music and it can generate it on a whim AND base it on their own personal experiences? \n\nImagine a world where AI knows your life and experiences so you ask it to make a song you can relate to in the style of X genre. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m overthinking it. What is the talk on campus about the future?",

If you do it could happen to you i would also try and get acquainted with some of the theory behind how its written and maybe develop a solo over the changes. Jazz or funk tends to go over well with berklee proff/faculty but more than anything they are looking for your musicianship and commitment to music. In the audition they try and find the edge of your knowledge which can be daunting but just remember that they are looking to see how you respond to not knowing something or being challenged good luck! -berklee 7th semester",

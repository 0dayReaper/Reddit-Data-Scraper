    "postText": "Hello! I'm currently getting ready for my audition for Berklee but I had a question for anyone who wants to answer it! So I'm auditioning for composition so I want to perform a piece of a well-known song that I arranged for my main instrument (I play the trumpet) plus the other instruments I play (Bass, guitar, piano). I think that it's good to show I have good music writing skills and playing technique all in one so is this a smart option? Any help will do, plus if there are any other tips anyone can give I would love to have them! Thank you :)",

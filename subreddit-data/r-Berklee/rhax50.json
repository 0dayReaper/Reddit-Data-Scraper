    "postText": "Last month, I was communicating with a professor about joining a by audition ensemble for the spring semester. Per his his request, I sent in an audition video about 3.5 weeks ago. I never heard back so last week I sent a follow up email, which I also haven\u2019t heard back from. I wanted to ask if anyone has had similar experiences and whether or not I should send another follow up email. If he didn\u2019t like my audition then that\u2019s fine, but it seems kinda shitty of him to not even acknowledge that I sent one in.",

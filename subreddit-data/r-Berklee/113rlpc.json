    "postText": "Hi everyone, I've been wondering about this for a while. I hope I can get some insight here.\n\nI'm a 22-year-old old classical singer from India. I've been training for a couple of years and I want to broaden my horizons, collaborate with people from different places having different perspectives and ideas, and network well in order to build a good career. Along with my Indian classical music knowledge, I want to learn more about western music.\n\nI realise Berklee is one of the best places to learn music and collaborate with people around the world, however, I don't want to let go of my Indian classical music roots while doing so, which is why I'm still in two minds about applying. If I get in, how much room will I have to exercise and showcase my Indian classical music knowledge? Is Berklee a good idea for someone in my situation?\n\nI haven't decided what program I want to apply to yet. I'd appreciate suggestions for that as well.\n\nThanks a lot in advance!!!",

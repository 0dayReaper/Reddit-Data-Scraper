    "postText": "I was a student there in the early 2000s, i was a guitar principal.  I remember most of the older guitar arrangements and texts having the same name sounding Jewish in origin. I'm having a total brain fart trying to remember the name. I have moved a few times over the years and have lost most of my textbooks.  If someone knows what I'm talking about please remind me of the name.  I would really appreciate it!",

When Bill was writing these books he bounced a lot of ideas off my dad and used him as a sort of reviewer for the first edition.   This was probably in like \u201866 or something.",

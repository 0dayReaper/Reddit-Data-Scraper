First time I played Beethoven's Sonata Pathetique and Jethro Tull's Thick as a Brick, and the second time I told them what I had played the first time and then just made some stuff up on top of a chord progression I'd been playing around with. I don't know for sure whether I'd have gotten in on it had I not previously been accepted, but I can confirm that it's possible to be admitted if you just improvise for your audition.",

I prepared a piece for my audition, and then one of the judges asked if I could improvise over some chords he was playing. So I think either way you might have a chance to improvise. Again, not sure though cause we have different instruments",

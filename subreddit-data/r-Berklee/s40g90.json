    "postText": "Hi There,\n\nI'm from the Bay Area CA and I ran into Berklee on the search for music tech majors. I have a bit of experience making music for commercials for Adobe, Bang Energy, and E! Network. I was curious if it was worth going into the music tech or what your experience was with Berklee's music department? Was it worth the cost, how were the professors, did you wish you chose a different school etc...?\n\nThanks in advance!",

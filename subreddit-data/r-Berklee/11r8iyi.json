I\u2019m preparing for what to do if I don\u2019t get into the major because i am aware of it\u2019s difficulty to get into. i just had a meeting with my student success advisor as to what i should do in the event i don\u2019t get in because i\u2019m worried i may not be able to graduate on time if i don\u2019t get in for third semester. it made me feel worse, her advice was essentially \u201ctry to work your way into some classes by talking to the department chair\u201d and \u201cload up your schedule with liberal arts.\u201d overall i\u2019m just uneasy about the whole situation. any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

I didn\u2019t get into my major until semester 4 bro. \n\nMy first three were virtual, sans the COVID era, and I applied during my 3rd semester. \n\nThe first piece of advice is sound. You should in fact, email professors in your desired major and see what you can get into. \n\nPopulation waivers ? Can you talk to someone who knows what you can do to bolster your resume for the major next semester ? \n\nIf you know what you want it\u2019s worth fighting for , and I think you\u2019re fighting yourself more than fighting FOR yourself. \n\nYou\u2019ll be all right , and I swear on my guitar that is the truth. \n\nIf all else fails, you go ahead and make an appointment with Case Management. Sarah Shadow is awesome ! She can help not only give you the definitive answer, but she can also help you get into contact with people who may know what you can do to get exposure in the majors curriculum. \n\nDon\u2019t make my mistake! Ask for help. Many times. Even if you\u2019re told no. \n\nEsse quam videri. \n\nTo be rather than to seem! \n\nYou are a musician. You are deserving to be here. \nPlease be kinder to yourself !",

I know people have gotten rejected the first time and get in the second try. Have you talked to the student advising mentors? I have a friend who is one, and they give advice to people trying to get in a lot.",

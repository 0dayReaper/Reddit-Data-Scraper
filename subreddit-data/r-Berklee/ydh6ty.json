    "postText": "Hey guys, just wanted to share my joy. I've always looked at Berklee as a place where only the best of the best get to study at, and somehow I've received my own acceptance letter!\n\nI've a couple of questions:  \n1. Do international students need to pay tuition all at once, or can it be done in multiple installments?\n\n2. When is the exact deadline for the payment of the tuition for the May 2023 semester (not the $1000 tuition deposit)?\n\n3. Why the fuck is it so expensive? I'm looking for sponsors here in Brazil to help me with that because, honestly, I cannot even pay for 10$ of the fees :'(.",

[Summer 2022 tuition](https://www.berklee.edu/student-accounts/tuition-and-related-costs) is due on May 4. You can expect the 2023 date to be around the same. But there's nothing official yet, so don't hold me to this.\n3. Unfortunately, finding sponsors and scholarships are not my expertise, but it HAS been done. What I can do to help is to help you ace your [ESPAs](https://college.berklee.edu/entering-student-proficiencies). I graduated in 3 years instead of the official 4.5 years. It's like getting a 30% discount off my degree lol. [Here's more info.](https://www.clarachanmusic.com/pre-college-courses)",

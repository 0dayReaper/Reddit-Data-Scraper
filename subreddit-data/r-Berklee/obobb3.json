I play Trumpet and the piece I plan to prepare is titled \"Andante et Allegro.\" Any alumni trumpet players or just alumni in general that have audition tips? Also how easy is it to get in? Thanks in Advance!",

            "comment": "Being a jazz based school the auditions will want to hear some jazz pieces to hear how you interpret the melody and improvise over changes. A classical piece is fine, but I would recommend preparing some songs from the Real Book or tunes based on jazz trumpeters. Miles Davis, Freddie Hubbard, Chet Baker, Dizzy Gillespie, etc.",

Also, on the audition website, I believe it states to prepare a piece that displays your strengths and weaknesses and not what you think the judges want to hear. I am classically trained so I do feel as if \"Andante et Allegro\" is absolutely AMAZING solo for displaying what I need to display!",

Yes, they have developed over the years to include many different facets of music like songwriting, music business, and the recent merger with Boston conservatory with theater and dance, so yes, they are more versatile. \n\nUltimately it depends on your instrument so as a trumpet player, you should be expected to know what jazz is and how to play/interpret jazz. It\u2019s the foundation of 75% (roughly speaking) of all the course material. \n\nAs someone who is a berklee prospective student advisor for over 10 years I\u2019m just giving you the advice and feedback I\u2019ve been giving countless students who wanted to attend berklee.",

I myself wasn\u2019t a jazz player when I auditioned but preparing for that audition and studying jazz is what helped me get accepted. A blend of jazz and also your strengths in classical music will help demonstrate your overall skills, talents, technique to showcase what you can do. \n\nStart practicing improvising over jazz blues changes and you\u2019ll put yourself into a better position. It\u2019s important to know the history of the music. Jazz music (or American music in general) wouldn\u2019t be where it is today without Buddy Bolden (arguably the first jazz trumpet player of all time), which led to Louis Armstrong to Dizzy Gillespie to Miles Davis to Wynton Marsalis. \n\nI\u2019d highly recommend watching the Ken Burns Jazz series on Netflix over the summer to give you a deep deep background to the history of that music, style, phrasing, evolution and more. Listening to Wynton will give you an incredible amount of depth to the music.",

When I auditioned regardless if I said jazz or classical, i had to prepare some jazz tunes that they required on the audition portal, and they had me solo over a simple C blues (was The Chicken to be exact). I also played my classical etude (tango etude, astor piazolla.) so yea. get ur jazz chops up fosho and the classical piece too! you can do it",

I actually had the impression that they appreciate all kinds of different musical backgrounds simply because it enriches the variety of musicians at the school which is actually a wonderful and somewhat rare thing. I had very little experience with jazz at the time I auditioned but as some of the others here have said it definitely can\u2019t hurt to start practicing improv since it will be a part of the audition. Don\u2019t be discouraged if it doesn\u2019t go as well as you\u2019d like it to though, they will most likely understand that it is new to you and judge you based on how much potential they see in your playing! To me it sounds like you already have a pretty good idea of what you need to prepare and do to maximize your chances, so good luck! And don\u2019t underestimate the interview ;)",

I played Meditation by Massenet (pretty much the most generic and overplayed violin solo piece ever) and it worked out fine so that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying go with whatever you are most comfortable with :) If the piece you\u2019re thinking of auditioning with shows off your strengths as a player overall I don\u2019t see why it would be a problem. Not everyone at Berklee is a jazz musician after all - I know quite a few classically trained students there. (You should still practice improv tho, don\u2019t get me wrong. It really helps to have some chops in that department.)",

    "postText": "So i wake up for the big day and head down. They put me in my practice room and I do my thing. My prepared piece is little wing by Jimmy Hendrix. I get into my audition room and my 2 judges are super nice! I tell them i have a backing track and one of the judges goes to set it up in the corner of the room on the speaker. After setting it up, my judge just starts playing it! No sort of \u201cok you ready?\u201d Nothing. He just starts playing it. So i panic and try to catch up with it. After i catch up i play through and sing the song pretty alright (i think).  \n\nNext we do improv. Which could have gone better but i was still nervous from the prep piece. After improv my judge asks me if i take lessons (which rlly scared me idk if thats bad)\n\nFor the improv my judge set up his phone to the speaker. But he leaves it connected and asks me to play some scales. During my A maj scale his phone ringer GOES OFF AND MESSES ME UP. so i had to start from the top. He was super upset and apologetic. From there the audition got more lighthearted and the judge seemed to ease up.\n\nWe did some call and response which im not the best at on guitar. So he had me sing back the pitches to him. He called me stevie wonder when i started to over sing a lil and we had a laugh.\n\nRhythm went rlly well as im also a percussionist. After we finished he said something like \u201cperfect good job!\u201d And that made me feel good. Sight reading was ok i could barely play the notes but he had me play the chords and it went well.\n\nAfter that was my interview and it went very well.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am i just being anxious? Will i be cut some slack due to some of the distractions?",

The auditions are really just to make sure that you have a decent enough foundation as a musician to enter into a full time music program. They\u2019re not looking for perfection, they\u2019re looking for potential.\n\nSource: I got in ten years ago and then helped with auditions and interviews while I was there :)",

            "comment": "They asked me if i understood that i was auditioning for guitar after i played my piece (i was auditioning for guitar) i croaked during the improv and forgot everything i know, aced the interveiw and ive been at berklee for 7 semester, it sounds like u did a good job all around. I think sometimes they are looking to see how u respond in a situation where your pushed out of your comfort zone, are you gonna shut down and freak out, or try your best and maintain composure? I think you probably have a good chance of getting accepted",

    "postText": "Hello all!\nI got in last year but couldn\u2019t afford to go. However, I know they received more money in endowments after I had applied to use for this year. Assuming that keeps up, I\u2019m thinking about reapplying, but is it even worth it? Will I get the scholarship to afford to go or is money less likely for transfers? I currently attend Belmont and don\u2019t feel like my credits will transfer due to how they format their commercial music degree. However I\u2019ve improved a lot as a musician in my first semester here and still don\u2019t want to give up on Berklee. Sorry this is a lot, but thoughts?",

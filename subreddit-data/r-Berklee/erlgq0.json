    "postText": "I'm an international student where your final exams are really the only results that matter (which I did ok in) however when I got my transcripts evaluated Berklee required all marks since grade 10, some of which were pretty terrible. I'm unfamiliar with the US scoring system but from what I gather 2.34 is pretty horrendous. Do I still have a chance of getting accepted if other parts of application are much stronger?\n\nthanks.",

But keep in mind the multiple factors, being that you\u2019re an international student and they understand the scoring system isn\u2019t the same, and the audition/interview is far more important. I can\u2019t speak for who they accept and who they don\u2019t, but I\u2019m almost certain that they will still consider you and give you a good chance.",

I had a friend (entered 2001) who was a flunky in high school, but an absolutely amazing guitarist. Got rejected at first, but then wrote them a letter begging, and made sure to send an audition. Got in, and came in with all 6's for his instrument entering. But... that was nearly 20 years ago. No idea if they are so flexible now.",

    "postText": "I recently graduated as a software engineer but have been into music for a long time now.\nBerklee Valencia's masters in music technology, production &amp; innovation sounds like an ideal program for me.\nGiven that I'm an international student, the initial fees which I'd have to submit would cost me around $600 which is a lot for an application fees. ($150 audition, $430 transcript equivalency)\n\nI'm adding this [tech+music](https://youtu.be/6V_P3MaWxf4) video to my portfolio hoping it might bring a difference to the low probability of even being considered.\n\nIs $600 worth the shot? (Or should i just invest in some more musical gear and focus on further developing this cap?)\nLooking for honest opinions",

I\u00b4ve paid 150$ audition, and now I\u00b4m looking for reviews about the master, I want to be super sure if it\u00b4s what I need (I\u00b4m guitarrist, songwriter, producer) \n\nso if someone can give us a review I will appreciate it very much\n\n[New single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9naM6LKX3a4)",

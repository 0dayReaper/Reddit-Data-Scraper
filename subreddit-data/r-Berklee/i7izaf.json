    "postText": "Apologies if this question and/or topic has been covered. I\u2019m wondering if the Master of Arts in Muisc Business Online is a new offering because of COVID or if it\u2019s been around and there might be some graduates on here. Also wondering anyone\u2019s insight as to applying for it. \n\nRough background of me: I\u2019m a Midwest based full-time freelance opera singer. I have a bachelor of music in voice performance and have been gigging around in union and non-union work since I graduated in 2012. As with most business, I wanna try to make a change in the world of opera and I think that starts in administration and who\u2019s running the companies. So I\u2019m trying to find out if this would be a good fit. I\u2019d be open to pivoting to other realms of the music business if that\u2019s where I can make better money. \n\nGrateful for any insight, opinions, concerns, and advice! Thanks!",

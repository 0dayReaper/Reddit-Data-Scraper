As an alumni, I have not been able to find any information online about him or if there will be some kind of ceremony open to the public. Does any one here have any more information? I would be shocked if the school doesn\u2019t acknowledge him publicly because he was so beloved by so many of us! Thank you guys!",

I knew a few profs who died in my time at Berklee, and generally the school was relatively quiet about them. Departments often post something, but I don't recall them putting out terribly much. \n\nKeep your heads up, and keep making the music that Jeff would have wanted you to make. Talk to someone if you need to. These things aren't easy.",

He was particularly upset because he hadn't heard any details from the school and couldn't find anyone who could tell him anything more. I'll update here if the students are told anything about a ceremony. my condolences, i'm only a first semester student but can tell by the reactions over here what an impact he had on the voice department and faculty.",

It\u2019s also very untimely. My friend found out because Lalah Hathaway posted something but we haven\u2019t seen anything since. I can\u2019t imagine what the vocal department is going through! I really appreciate you keeping us updated if you hear anything!\n\nPS. Enjoy Berklee! It\u2019s one my most favorite places on earth!",

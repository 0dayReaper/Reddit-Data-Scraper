I got accepted a few weeks ago and didn\u2019t have to write an essay ever. I would do the Asia only audition because I think the 9am to 12pm EST maybe Boston time. For academic history, write something. The more information you have in the application, the better. Your application is really how the school gets to know you so the more you can tell them about yourself, the better.",

Calling is the quickest way, but email is good too.",

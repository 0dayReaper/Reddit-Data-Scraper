    "postText": "I'm a vocalist and I work primarily with a beatboxer to create \"trip hop / alternative \" style melodic beat music. We have been looping these (mostly live) on a boss looper with effects n whatnot but now that we are going digital we need a better way to record and produce the songs. We also use instruments such as the acoustic guitar and trombone.\n\nShould we be using a machine mk3 or ableton push?? Here's an example of what we do: [https://youtu.be/qySDTyTuFnE](https://youtu.be/qySDTyTuFnE)",

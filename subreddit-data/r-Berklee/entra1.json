Dealing with the computer's automation is a bit of a pain, and clearly setting it up at first is a load of difference... but the concepts all follow through pretty well. An EQ is still just an EQ... I guess most Mackies don't have compression, but it's not a difficult concept. \n\nYes, using it well is still difficult. But eh... that's just something you learn over time\n\nWhenever I sit someone down in front of a console I break things down for them just looking at a single channel. It looks like a lot, but it really isn't so bad.",

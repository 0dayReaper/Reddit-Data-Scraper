    "postText": "I am a classical flautist wanting to attend Berklee Five Weeks when it goes back in-person again. However, most people that attend Five Weeks seem to be either bassists/guitarists, vocalists, or some type of jazz musician. \n\nI eventually want to major in composition/film scoring, but Five Weeks is definitely something I want to go to. I was wondering if any classical musicians here have gone to Five Weeks and could share their experience about it!",

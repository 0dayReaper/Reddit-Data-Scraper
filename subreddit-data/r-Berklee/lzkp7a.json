            "comment": "After finishing Berklee (2008) finding a decent job in music was nearly impossible. Lots of unpaid internships are available in high cost of living cities (NYC, LA) and also require a car. Unless you're wealthy, most people can't do that for very long if at all. How can you pay for a car + rent + existence + student loans in a city like that without income? Most of those jobs say you can't work another job too.\n\nAnyway, I wasn't able to find a good job in music. I applied to everything I could, and was making less money than I had been in high school. \n\nI basically took some marketing/admin type positions, and then eventually switched over to computer programming. Been doing that since then, and I'm making fantastic money, but Berklee was basically zero help. In the Boston area Berklee grads are super common too, making it even harder to pivot when you first get out of school (finding a job your last semester, etc). \n\nBerklee historically, when I started there, was *very* bad about telling prospective students about any stats on job placements, average salaries, etc. You could ask, and they'd sidestep the question and just point to people with Grammy awards.",

I'd love for someone to reach out to me to talk about my experience there, and afterward. But they only reach out looking for donations. I told them I'll _consider_ it when I'm done paying these hellish student loans. \n\nOh yea, and it's likely that Berklee was part of some student loan kickback thing that was being investigated about a decade ago (dunno what happened, I think the investigator went into politics deeper and dropped it) about student loans to push people into private loans. So even if there is ever student loan forgiveness for some federal, I'm fucked.",

I graduated in \u201809 in the middle of the financial crisis so things were tough but I moved to Colorado after school working in the live music industry, gigging around town in different bands, working the event/wedding circuit in the summer which brings in good money, lots of teaching to the suburbs and schools. Some studio work from time to time but that\u2019s not as prevalent as the other cities. \n\nAs far as career rate, you can either go the industry way working for a management, marketing, booking or things like that, or you try to make your way as a performer in LA or NY as a session player either for Broadway pits or side players for solo acts. \n\nAs a musician, you should get used to the fact you will always have multiple sources of income. As a player it comes from teaching, performing and recording and that can vary in \u201csalary\u201d tremendously based on your talent, work ethic and instrument.\n\nHope that helps.",

I played on cruise ships, wedding bands, cover bands, my own bands, taught in schools and privately. It's a fun life but its also grueling and solely on you to make money. I eventually had the opportunity to go back to college for mechanical engineering and immedtly got a job in that field. I'm much happier now then I was back then. It's nice to make a good salary and not have to constantly worry about networking and hustling.",

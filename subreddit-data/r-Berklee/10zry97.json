    "postText": "My daughter got accepted to the **Music Industry Leadership and Innovation** Jan. 31 and we have had no word of a Financial Aid package. Were told we would find out in March. I am hearing others getting a package with their acceptance, and wondering if anyone can shed light. Are there two types of packages, Merit Scholarships sent with acceptances and need-based sent in March? Wondering if no package yet means bad news all around. Berklee is her first choice, but bracing ourselves that we are going to need to tell her she can't go. We did the FAFSA, and have applied to a ton of outside scholarships that we are waiting to hear back from. Any insights?  Thank you.",

My concern is others are getting money upfront, and it's crickets for us. But it wasn't $0, just nothing yet. We've reached out to Financial Aid and they said to check later. Congratulations on your acceptance and package!",

However it would usually start to apply once she is in her second or third semester since the school need to see her grades.",

Berkelee lost her audition which she did in November-it was never added to her portal. They finally tracked it down after a few calls and e-mails, but it makes no sense to me that even though she applied for early acceptance-she has received no $$$. Btw her grades are outstanding\u2026 is it the major???",

This major is now in its 2nd year and Berklee has all kinds of scholarships for gifted musicians but this major feels like a bit of an orphan. In our case, it is the only major we can take my daughter is not a musician. But it's making me question whether it is a good idea to go to a school for musicians and not play an instrument. That said, my daughter participated in last year's Summer Program with Dr. Butler (the woman who runs this program) and was blown away. \n\nWe also know several people who were deferred, or not accepted so would have hoped that the Early Action \"Yes's\" would qualify for some kind of merit aid. Good luck, maybe our kids will be in school together next year. Here's hoping!",

They literally lost her audition. I had to call   a few different People to get it straightened out, they first told her she would have to re-try out, which is ridiculous! She should\u2019ve known earlier, but they did not tell her until this Friday. I am not terribly impressed with the way they handled the situation. Maybe the girls will be in school together but at this point without any Scholarship it\u2019s a crazy amount to pay. She got in the Belmont and Drexel and got $$$",

I was very impressed with Drexel and waiting to hear back. That's terrible about the Audition Tape, altogether the interactions with Berklee have been pleasant enough, but I feel a level of disorganization and a gut feeling that they are understaffed. You can't get people to pick up the phone in either Admissions or Financial Aid. We also got into Hofstra, and they have been extremely organized, and working hard to recruit accepted students with many interactions with the parents and students, Accepted Student days, a chance to try out classes online. We've gotten none of that from Berklee. I agree it's also a crazy amount to pay, but we have been applying to many scholarships since it was her first choice school. Good luck with the whole process!",

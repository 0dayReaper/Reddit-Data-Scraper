    "postText": "Hai\n\nI graduated from Berklee in 2014 (EPD Major, you can see an old post I made with most of my feelings on Berklee [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Berklee/comments/251tfo/im_a_graduate_from_berklee_as_of_may_7th_2014/))\n\nAnyways\n\nHaving graduated 4 years ago, I have had a lot of time to reflect and consider a great many thoughts on the school; but there is one tip that I feel is helpful enough to make a whole post about! (AKA: *One hot tip Berklee doesn't want you to know about!* \\#SEO... Just kidding)\n\nWhile you're at Berklee, take advantage of the ***Lynda*** account your student status provides for you. It can come in handy to supplement your studies while you're there; but you also get access to it with your username/password combo after you graduate! That's basically an infinite source of high-quality education beyond your graduation, and all you have to do is sign up =D The caveat is, of course: if you don't sign up while you're a student, you won't get the access. (Be warned, don't plan on being able to change your password on Lynda once you graduate because it will need to send a confirmation to your *(x)@berklee.edu* email, which gets deactivated a year or two after you finish with the school)\n\nBecause of having done this, I've had Lynda Premium ($37.50/mo if you were to subscribe on your own) for 4 years, which works out to about $1800 USD saved for a service which grants you LinkedIn accreditation in the subjects you complete =\\] This has proven to be hugely beneficial in helping me grow and become far more edified in my current occupation (programmer).\n\n**Tl;dr**: Sign up for Lynda when you're at Berklee, you keep the account after and it's 1000% worth it.\n\nAlso, while I'm here, feel free to AMA if you want, haha.

There\u2019s just so much better value to be found \u2014 a MacBook Pro configured to my needs is $4792 (!!!). I\u2019ve also been producing music on Windows for about 5 years now. I\u2019m thinking I can get a refurb MBP to fulfill the requirement (again, if I get in) and a ThinkPad P1/ZBook X360/Precision 5530. I can also build a mini desktop with the upcoming i9-9900K in lieu of the Win laptop if that helps. \n\nThanks for your time. ",

                    "comment": "That will largely depend on the class in question. Nearly all of my classes needed to see the project files rather than raw output, so if I was working on a Pro Tools, Ableton, Cubase, or Max MSP project then it was no problem to work on Windows; but if the project happened to be Logic, that obv required the Mac environment.\n\nI don't know if it's still this way, but when my friends and I started, upon entry to your first semester they *require* you to have a MBP with a core set of software installed from Berklee (edit: this still seems to be right - [more info here](https://www.berklee.edu/sts/tech-requirements)). If you have your own MBP, and it meets their minimum specs, I think they'll install it all on there for you (includes Finale, Logic, etc); but if you don't then you have to pick one up from the school. \n\nHopefully that helps!",

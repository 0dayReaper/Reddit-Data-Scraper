    "postText": "I've been struggling choose two majors of EPD, MP&amp;E, and CWP. \n\nI was very interested in MP&amp;E and have heard that it's one of the majors that could offer stable jobs. However, I interviewed one of the professor yesterday and she said that the majority of graduates from MP&amp;E could not have a full time job until a year later after doing internships. After finding a full-time job, you need to work at least ten years to consider \"professional.\" If people who saw this post graduated from a MP&amp;E major, would you please tell me more about your job experience and salary wise?\n\nFor EPD, I've heard the teachers and the courses are great, and usually students could find a stable job right after graduate from Berklee. I'm also interested in EPD but really not sure if I'd be able to make it to the end because there are lots of new course materials.\n\nLastly, for CWP. This is my most favorite one among the three. However, after seeing the course schedule, I feel like I have already known half of the stuff (big band writing, arranging 2, and production etc)and not sure if it's worth to take it. If I major in either MPE or EPD, it would cover the production side on CWP as well. Also, after looking at the careers in CWP, I feel a little bit unsecure. Can people find a stable job after graduating from CWP? I would LOVE to be an arranger or composer, but I'm not sure if I can have a stable income by doing that.\n\nTo Berklee alumni out there, please help me pick two majors from the three! Thank you!",

The recording industry has shifted MASSIVELY over the past 20 years. Whereas in the early 1960's you could just kinda show up to EMI, ask for a basic entry level job, and a few years later be the \"balance engineer\" for The Beatles (and paid for it all along), it's nonstop internships now, with the hopes of having a real full time paid job being more and more difficult. Factor in the high likelihood that in order to have options (and a plan b) you'll need to be in LA, Nashville, Atlanta or NYC (Nashville being the cheapest, and perhaps really best option even if you don't like country - still not cheap), and paying rent (and likely student loans), and many studios will want you to have a car too... It's going to be hard to pay for all of those after a year. You'll go into more debt. It will be hard. \n\nIt's definitely not impossible. People find jobs. But the budgets of yesteryear are gone. Even many artists at the top of the charts are rarely spending $100k on an album these days, when at one point that would have been not too fancy at all. \n\nI mean; real talk - the industry is hard, no matter your path. There's no shortcuts. It's amazing, but also awful. Nothing is guaranteed. A lot of the successful people I know are successful at least in part because they had resources (family money) to help them along for quite a while until they were able to float. You're going to need to network your ass off, get burned a lot, but also get lucky. \n\nI find it \\*highly\\* doubtful that you'll find anything paying even $15/hr full time by just applying to every studio in the US even after leaving MP&amp;E. And you'll potentially have nearly $200k in debt (\\~$1800/month payments). I might be cynical, or wrong. Would love to head success stories. \n\nBerklee HATES to be transparent and show actual salaries of graduates, or how many work in the field, because the secret is that those numbers are NOT good.",

            "comment": "I think it really depends on what you want your actual job to be. These three majors have different types of careers.\n\nEPD is the one that could offer stable jobs. You learn sound design, synthesis. I would choose this one and teach yourself everything else you want to learn from the other majors. Of the people I went to school with, this major seemed to produce the most jobs. They might be sound design for a video game, which could be something you're not interested in but at least it's a job.\n\nMP&amp;E is the one that teaches you how large studios work and how to be a producer/engineer. Very rewarding while in the program and really flashy because you get access to these huge studios and boards, but jobs are hard to come by. MP&amp;E prepares you to be able to work in the big rooms, but the music industry doesn't really operate like that any more. In order to become an engineer you have to first become an assistant and before that a runner. Runners make something like $8/hr and have to work all day every day. Also the head engineers aren't going anywhere so there aren't usually openings. Most people I know that went down this road quit and went on to do their own thing whether that be linking with an artist and becoming their producer or just flat out switching careers.\n\nCWP is for songwriters that want to know how to record themselves. Being an MP&amp;E person, I think you could benefit just as much from watching some youtube videos and learning how to record in your bedroom/apartment.",

Do you think it's possible for me to do MP&amp;E jobs (start from a runner) while working full-time in a sound design company?\n\nAlso, what are some other majors that could offer stable jobs? I know Music Education could, but I don't really want to spend my time learning that.",

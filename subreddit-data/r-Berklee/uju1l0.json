    "postText": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m a high school senior who was admitted to both UCLA Herb Alpert School of music and Berklee College of Music, both on full scholarship. I was wondering if anyone had any advice or comparison between the two schools. At the moment I am most likely choosing Berklee, but I would like to get as much information as possible before I choose. Thank you!",

I recently got my degree as a Music Producer, and now I want to apply to the Master in Music Business in Valencia campus. I'm from Colombia, and I want to apply for scholarships but I don't know if i'll really can get it. I'm scared because just the fee for applying is expensive for me, so I don't want to pay that amount if I've not the possibility to get the scholarship. Do you know what they consider for scholarships? Do I have to have a lot of experience working as a musician? Or it's about my letters of recommendation and the reasons I want to get into Berklee. Thank you!",

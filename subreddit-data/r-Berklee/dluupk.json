I just finished filling out my application, just need my fee waver from my counselor. What would be the next step if they accept my application? I see an audition is all over the place. I play guitar. Do I need to play a song? In person or over camera? Why is this so stressful? .-.",

I sat there, looked at it for a second, tried to play it but messed up on the second note, and kept struggling until he told me it's okay, I don't have to do it.\n\nI'm writing this from class at Berklee right now.\n\nYou're gonna be fine. The audition is incredibly laid back, don't overthink the piece or try to play something complicated to \"impress\" the judges. Play what makes you happy, what you think makes you shine through the most.\n\nI'm a first semester guitarist here so I know what you're going through, I was exactly where you were last year. I would absolutely recommend coming here, it's amazing so far. DM me if you'd like, I'd be happy to help with anything else man.\n\nDon't stress too much!",

What u/tibbon said is really fucking important, and could fuck you up for the rest of your life. I graduated in 2013, and the cost has almost DOUBLED since then. I know very, very few people who are close to finishing off their loans and it's fucking them up, hard. Working crazy, endless hours during the day to pay your bills, living with 4 roommates in a tiny apartment, begging to get gigs that pay $250 to get home at 3am, if you're lucky. Then getting up again at 5am for an opening shift at their non-music-industry job.\n\nAnd these are the talented musicians, everybody wants them in the band, they came into Berklee sight-reading, ratings 5+, but the pay isn't ever enough to keep up with your loan payments. Even the dude I knew who got the presidential scholarship (full ride) is struggling because of the high cost of living in Boston while he was attending.\n\nRead this, top to bottom: \n\nhttps://www.collegecalc.org/colleges/massachusetts/berklee-college-of-music/\n\nBut this line in particular:\n&gt;The total of all payments including interest would sum **$192,637.09**. This could be your effective total out of pocket cost of an education at Berklee College of Music. Note that this calculation **assumes you don't pay full list price tuition**, are part of the reported 51% of students at this school who receive financial aid\n\n\nWhatever you need to pay for rent, food, etc, etc... you will also need to pay an addition **$1,600 PER MONTH** for the next **10 YEARS** to pay off your loans, assuming you've qualified for financial aid. That means if you manage to find a steady, salaried job that will pay you $50k per year, more than 50% of that is going to paying off your Berklee loans.\n\nYes, reality is a bitch, but don't fuck your future self by saying \"I'm sure I'll figure it out\" -- figure it the fuck out NOW.",

And paying NYC or LA rent ($1000+ month for even a shitty place). Oh, and none of them will give you health insurance, etc... all of these things seem unimportant when you're 17/18, but really do matter. Another real downside is that no one wants to date a 25-year-old broke-ass musician who can't even afford a cup of coffee (these aren't my words, but the words I heard from people when I was 25 and broke trying to date). Good luck ever saving money for a car, house, vacation, etc when you're paying for student loans nonstop. \n\nOn the flipside, go to a cheaper school for *any* engineering field, and get a job paying $70-100k right out of school, pay minimal (or no) student loans, and then have the time/money to buy a house, travel, buy music gear, buy a van to gig with your band, go to the nice recording studios in town, etc.",

Class sizes are small, and you'll get far more 1:1 instruction than you will pretty much anywhere else, in any subject. Even my largest classes like Acoustics were only 75 people or so, which is about the average class size for things at many universities. \n\nIt isn't a research institution, so professors aren't constantly chasing grants. On the downside, there's no research mentality, so there isn't opportunity to get your names on papers and such. \n\nThere's pretty great (although sometimes crowded) access to neat gear; but really don't let that overly excite you. Access to the MP&amp;E studios is tight, late nights, and never for as long as you want. It will get you some great experience, but also is there to impress for tours and such. Realistically, I got *far* more studio time and gear access at a medium-sized public university in NC than I ever did at Berklee.\n\nEveryone's in it for similar reasons; so there's a lot to connect with other students about. There are no non-music people (obviously), which is unique. But also a downside, in that people aren't particularly well rounded, and it can be a bit of an echo chamber.\n\nIt's a \"different\" college experience than most in that there's practically no campus. I used to joke that Berklee didn't own a single blade of grass. That might not be true now, but it is a distinctly urban feel, and doesn't have the sprawling idyllic campus for late night walks, growth and contemplation. For some people that's great, for others less so. \n\nIf you're already good, and want to get great, then this can be an amazing opportunity to connect with people, including professors and really accelerate your career. But if you just go to class and get grades, then it really isn't worth it. You need to be making it a super active experience, and digging in deep. \n\nIt's weird, now over a decade out of Berklee, I'm friends with some professors and see them as peers. They are all great; but they also don't seem magical to me. Talented, absolutely, but I have my own special talents as well and just think of them as normal people. \n\nIf I went to Berklee again in some magic time machine, I'd focus super hard, not date anyone (seriously that ate a lot of my life living with a girlfriend then), and basically eat/sleep/breathe music for four years. Play on every gig possible, and not care if it's \"my perfect idea of music\" or not. Get to know professors. Get to know people running music businesses in town. I'm not sure where it would net me in the end, but it would be something. I'd probably have focused on one instrument a little harder. I'm a multi-instrumentalist, but that's harder to get gigs than just being a badass at one.",

More students who are truly making original music and art. More on-campus opportunities. Better bands playing at their parties (fucking Nirvana played Steer Roast, basically a big dorm party, in 1990- and didn't go anywhere near Berklee).

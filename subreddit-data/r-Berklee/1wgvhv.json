All it would take is 3-4 people sharing their individual experience to get a general idea. Then the usual \"play what you're good at, not necessarily just jazz\" kind of stuff. \n\nI know a lot of other Berklee alum who use reddit, but not a lot of action on this sub, I think if we clean it up a bit it'll help out.\n\nEdit: going over the front page, this feels like a 'prospective berklee student' sub. I'm all for helping out, but it's getting out of hand.\n",

I'll send a message to bigkahuna tomorrow to see what we can do. i just found [this post] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Berklee/comments/1xmpsl/piano_audition/cfd49c9) that might be a good place to start as far as audition FAQ goes. These audition posts are killing me, some moderators cleaning it up would help immensely. I'll volunteer too. ",

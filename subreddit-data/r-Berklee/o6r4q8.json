How old is too old for Berklee?\nI would appreciate any advice or info.\n\nThanks!",

I looked into Berklee online and few other options, but I need a break from work, so I don't mind spending few years in a music school and then getting back to work if I don't make it as a rockstar.  \n\nI think I'm at a stage where private lessons are not helping much. I need a structured plan and some time off to study without the stress of work. \n\nI won't be taking a loan for sure if I decide to do this.\n\nNew England Conservatory is another option, and they have continuing education jazz program, which is much cheaper than Berklee. I think it is more structured compared to the principal instrument course.\n\nJust exploring options right now.",

    "postText": "Hi, I was thinking of auditioning next fall for the fall semester of 2023 but then I realized that I can go to Berklee Five-Week and audition at the end of it so I can apply as early as possible. I want to apply as early as possible to show enthusiasm (I've heard the earlier you apply, the better the chances are of getting in). But I'm also worried that maybe I'll audition too early and that maybe it's better to audition later because then I'll have more time to prepare and will have grown a little more as a musician.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Is it better to apply as early as possible with the knowledge, musicianship and technical abilities you have at that time or is it better to wait and audition when there is more competition but you have become a better player?\n\nAm I even understanding this correctly? The later you audition the more competition right?\n\nI'm also wondering whether Five-Week will help or not because of course it will help me grow as a musician and I feel like the summer program is like a five week long audition because the staff will be able to see how you learn and work and will have more time to get to know you and your abilities (I know a girl that went to a ballet summer program in NYC and was offered to go to a prestigious school just because some guy saw her dance and was impressed, I don't even think she was applying for anything) but then again I feel like I could blow my chances if I don't impress during the five week program. Does that make sense? Does your performance during five week or even your applying for five week have any impact on your getting into Berklee College of Music? Are the people that audition you for the school even involved with five week at all or do they get some people that haven't gotten to know the students to do the auditions?\n\nI hope this makes sense and looking forward to reading your replies!",

If you believe you\u2019re a stronger musican, your chances of auditioning during 5-week are the same as auditioning early action for berklee. I didn\u2019t do 5-week and instead spent the summer preparing for my audition, then auditioned in November for early action and got in. 5-week will certainly help you stand out, but just because you DONT do it doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t get in. A ton of people i know got in without it.",

    "postText": "so i\u2019m a future student, starting in fall 2020. i\u2019m a classically trained pianist who really wants to learn more jazz and contemporary styles, and play music with people/make friends. \n\ni have pretty good ears (perfect pitch) and am generally well versed in terms of technique, but don\u2019t have a strong jazz/improvisation background. will it be hard for me to find people to play with? also, how in demand generally are pianists when it comes to gigs/recording sessions/performance opportunities etc? i know that there are a lot of piano principals at berklee so does that kinda give us more competition for gigs and stuff?\n\nalso do any of y\u2019all have some good self care tips/motivational things to keep in mind for entering students? i\u2019m super excited to start but thinking about it also makes me anxious and feel nervous/self conscious/insecure because of all the talent that will inevitably surround me hahaha any self esteem/ego management tips would be greatly appreciated",

The professors here are all very nice and helpful except for the occasional odd ones lol, but overall the professors here are extremely helpful if you have any concerns. Feel free to watch some introduction videos and get some leadsheets and on how to read them too!!! Feel free to hmu for further questions. Would be happy to help a fellow classical pianist out!!! And congratulations to your acceptance to Berklee!!!",

I\u2019ll be graduating this semester!\n\nI think piano is the 3rd or 4th most popular principal instrument (behind voice and guitar). Almost everyone feels intimidated going into Berklee. Some people get discouraged and others are inspired. When you get here, you\u2019ll your ratings audition and be placed into an ensemble with people who have similar ratings. I got placed into Small Jazz Ensemble level 4 and it was pretty hard for me lol. But I\u2019m not focused in performance at all.\n\nMy advice would be to try not to compare yourself to other students. Everyone has their own thing going on. Build up your self awareness and find what makes you happy and work towards that. Also find some balance. Some people study/practice 24/7 and never go out and make friends. Other people go out way too much and fall behind in their studies. \n\nAlso there\u2019s a ton of opportunity for playing piano. Join all the Facebook groups related to Berklee. People are always looking for pianists. I haven\u2019t performed that much at Berklee cuz I\u2019ve been staying pretty lowkey and just focusing on my EPD classes + outside projects. But if you want to perform a lot then you definitely can find opportunities. \n\nGood luck and if u got any questions hmu!",

Just use your best common sense; try not to walk in the dark with headphones in, stay alert, and stick to the busy roads like Boylston whenever possible. Berklee police also has a system where an officer will escort you somewhere if you don\u2019t feel safe - that\u2019s a good option if you end up with a situation and need to get home.",

As a girl, I usually always like to have someone with me regardless of where I am but in my experience being here in Boston (near campus) the location so far seems to be safe enough. Berklee also has its own police station! I'm more scared of the drivers because the school campus is along a main road.",

The number of people hitting on you in school is unbelievable. Including teachers. Boylston st is safe during the day. Forget at night. Only go out with people you TRUST. Do not get drunk with people you don\u2019t know. Boston, during the day is basically okay. The south end and Roxbury are off limits for women. Always keep your eyes open. Be safe.",

Berklee's Campus Police are always around, and since Berklee owns several buildings in the area, you will see them all around the neighborhood, not just at the school's main buildings. There are a lot of college-aged women in the neighborhood, so at any given time or place, you probably wouldn't be the only woman around. I don't have a daughter, but if I did, I would be totally OK with her living in the neighborhood.",

Just keep walking and be alert. While the other Berklee students are out, there is safety in numbers and Berklee stuff goes to about 11. Other parks of Back Bay are fine.\n\nFenway is fine, just stay out of the Victory Gardens and park after dark.",

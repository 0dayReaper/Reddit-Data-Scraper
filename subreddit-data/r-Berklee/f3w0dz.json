Are you going to take one to every class? \n\nIf you're the reincarnation of [Wah Wah Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wah_Wah_Watson), then definitely bring the wah. If it's a neat accessory to your playing, then leave it at home. \n\nIn general, they want to hear your playing approach, not your gear. \n\nDo you think there's a chance they listen to your playing without a wah and say, \"You know, that would have been perfect, if there had only been a wah pedal there?\". Do you think there's a chance they won't be able to see the real you without it? \n\nHere's the thing; imagine an artist you really love that's heavy on effects. Tom Morello's on his Whammy pedal, or The Edge with delay units. Both are fantastic players. Either of them could breeze through an audition without the pedals. With that in mind, do you really need a pedal there?",

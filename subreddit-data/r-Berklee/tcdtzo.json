Mind you, I'm a graduate from years ago so I was able to get into the mix of the industry before the whole music/audio world fell apart, but let's be real - music and audio production is a trust fund sport in 2022.  If you have an opportunity to have your family support you and your endeavors, great.  You'll be fine.  If you're like many of us that paid WAY too much money to go there and have had to wear tons of hats to make ends meet, well, it will be that for you and then worse.   \n\n\nSorry for the wake up call.  I'm not sure how that place stays open in this day and age other than the fact that very wealthy families with kinda talented kids keep the doors open plus all the others that are willing to take out a mortgage in the name of education.    \n\n\nI'd never go there today.  Not even close to being worth it. The amount of information available for next to nothing is endless.    \n\n\nBerklee is a suckers bet in this modern music landscape.  I'm sorry that you're out of work and hope that you'll be able to put something together.  I have many friends that don't even do music anymore while still paying on their Berklee mortgage.  \n\n\nGood luck.",

                    "comment": "Well, I am kinda surprised that I got this serious response. I was sorta semi-joking lol. First of all, I was NOT planning to graduate this school for so many reasons when I got accepted by berklee back in high school. I've never thought I'm talented enough to do music for living. so I was gonna attend there for a couple of semesters, quite it and go to a local uni then get a \"real\" job. I also had a financial issue obviously because the tuition, rent and whatnot are crazy in Boston. \n\nBut luckily, berklee and other organisation gave me enough scholarship for me to finish the school so I decided to keep attending the school. by the time I made that decision, I'd been in deep shit and caught up in the \"dream\". ya know, musicians are nice people especially for us musicians, always good to hang, vibing with them and spending exciting nights playing some dope ass music. I gradually started to get called for gigs. I did really have some momentum going as a musician.but the covid thing happened and I went back to hometown, took a year off till berklee fully open again. I wasn't really big fan of Zoom classes. \n\nSo during that time, I had some time and started to ask myself. \" can I become a musican?\" or more like \"should I?\"\n\nwell at this point, my answer is Idk. lol\n\nI don't want anybody to get me wrong. I am neither being pessimistic or depressed nor optimistic like \"everybody is talented!!! everything's gonna be fine!\"\n\nFor me, music is just something I can keep doing even when I have a bad day. in other words, it's my passion. I'm just doing what I want to do. I'm not really expecting a huge success( but I do hope lol) from it, I'm rather trying to find way to pay my bills with doing it. things has changed, I was a guitarist when I started my berklee life but now I am aiming for the production side. I am not sure where this is taking me. But I hopefully will survive or not lol just Que sera sera.\n\nlastly, I am not against berklee. I learned a lot and met many good people when I was there, full of positive vibe although there so many shitty things I really hope they get rid of soon tbh.\n\nanyway, thank you for reading this long shit and wishing me luck!:) Good luck on your music life as well. G'day",

                    "comment": "So I see these kinds of posts about Berklee very once in awhile and my question is - how is this different than a music degree from any school? I mean, let's say you graduate with a music degree from University of Whatever State. Does that make you any more employable than a degree from Berklee? But then someone will say, yeah, but that was cheap so I don't have a ton of debt. (I went to all public universities and had debt for years, btw.)  But Berklee isn't any more expensive than most private schools, and student debt can happen for any major at any school.  So why would someone hate on Berklee for being expensive when it's no more expensive than Northeastern, BU, Syracuse, Ithaca, NYU, etc. If I graduate from Syracuse with a degree in Music Performance, I have paid the same amount for my degree, aren't I just as employable or not employable? So why is this considered a failing of Berklee? (I'm actually genuinely curious, as my son wants to attend Berklee for film scoring/composition.) A friend of mine's son just got into Northeastern, but he won't be able to attend because of the tuition and he doesn't want that kind of debt. If someone wants to go into debt for a degree, that's their choice, regardless of the school or major.  \nAnd while we are it, how inherently more employable is someone who graduates with a degree in Philosophy, or English, or History, or Women's Studies? From any University, public or private? My sister graduated with a degree in graphic design and manages the office at a boat harbor. My husband graduated with a degree in international business, couldn't find a job, taught himself programming, and now works in IT.",

                            "comment": "Generally, the expensive tuition of college and uni is a very serious problem for us young people.  In most of \u201cleading\u201d country, it\u2019s kinda required us to get higher education to get better jobs although number of opportunities are becoming less while more students are trying to go to college and colleges are increasing the tuition every year. As a result of it, many students ended up tons of debt like you said and being jobless or something like that .but I think that\u2019s just a general thing, this isn\u2019t only thing for Berklee.\nSo besides that, in my opinion, we do have such high hope and expectations from what we think berklee will give us, before we go there.\nBerklee is a very worldly well known school at least among musicians. And there are so many great famous musicians from Berklee. So we kinda trick and give ourselves an idea that Berklee automatically makes us a great and famous musician. So there will be a big gap between what you thought you were gonna be and what you are rn after you finished the school.\nThings keep changing, I think the situation is drastically different than even five years ago.\nI can proudly say berklee is a still one of the greatest music schools around the world. However, if you ask me \u201cdoes it have to be berkee?\u201d, it\u2019s hard for me to say, clearly, \u201cyes\u201d",

            "comment": "Hey there, not any questions but might be able to give you my story as a 2015 grad:\n\nI\u2019m not gonna lie: a lot of my expectations when I graduated came tumbling down after about a year or so. I moved back in with my folks a few months after graduation then saved money to move to Austin. It wasn\u2019t until I started gigging again in 2016 that I saw the benefits of the actual theory and ear training education you get from Berklee. Straight up, Berklee\u2019s approach to harmony and ET is so much more intuitive than many other colleges. I talked with one particular guy I was working with at a local music school here who studied music at his local college but looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language when I talked about modes or chord scales.\n\nThat said, keep in touch with your friends from college. You don\u2019t know who will actually be gigging consistently and who will burn out. Don\u2019t expect Berklee to help you network. Like at all. The online music network has been a joke IMO. There are Berklee groups in Austin that meet up, but other than that, you gotta make things happen on your own.\n\nBest advice I can give any Berklee grad student: when you move to your local music scene, get in with people who are already gigging. Go to shows, find your local organizations that support local arts, talk to people who are working in music in multiple capacities. Keep creating and putting content out there. The more you expose your talents to your scene, the more likely you can make music your full time job. It took me a long time to get to that point.\n\nBest of luck!!!\n\nEdit: oh, and they don\u2019t exactly tell you this when you graduate, but a lot of your Berklee connects will eventually find non-music work. I had to work outside of music for a few years before doing it full-time.",

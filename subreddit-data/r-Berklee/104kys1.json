    "postText": "Hi everyone!! I will be starting in May 2023 for my undergraduate program! I already confirmed the offer and am excited but get two questions\u2026 \n\n1. Is it common to have the summer semester as the first semester? Will it be different from the other two semesters besides the shorter time?\n2. Since Berklee has three semesters, if I start in the summer of 2023, does that mean my semester break will be spring 2024, or I'll have spring 2024 and summer 2024 off?\n\nThanks in advance if anyone can answer the question and find schoolmates starting in May 2023 too!!",

I got accepted for May too. \nI wonder the same things so I\u2019ll be saving this post. \n\nI would say it\u2019s common, but I guess not as common as Fall, because most kids are graduating high school and probably have plans for summer. I know a lot of people starting in January and May, mostly older kids like myself. I believe we will also be graduating a year early too compared to kids coming in the Fall (correct me if I\u2019m wrong).\n\n\nReally curious about the breaks though.",

Yes, very common, you will also meet lot of people doing their second degree and starting in summer or spring due to work.\nYes, summer semester is shorter, classes are more intense, more studio time if you are in mpe or epd, more practice room time if you are in performance, all because of fewer students taking summer sem. However, not every professors are in school during summer, so plan well for your classes registration, use ratemyprofessor.\n\n2. It depends, I think you can take summer holiday whenever you want (don\u2019t count on me though, I didn\u2019t take any semester break\u2026), but for international students, they have to take two semesters of classes before getting a semester break (roommate was an international student)",

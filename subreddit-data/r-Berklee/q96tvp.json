For me, my private instructor would ask me about my interests and would choose a piece and a lead sheet that would fit that.  Some would just straight up assign a jazz related piece and lead sheet which is also fine with me since I'm not that strong with jazz.  \n\nIn an ensemble setting class it would depend on the genre of the ensemble since there are a lot of ensemble classes that focuses on specific genres.",

My PI is also totally new to Berklee this semester so I\u2019d say it depends on who you get.",

    "postText": "So I applied to Berklee on August 2nd 2021. I've made sure everything is in the system and have emailed the admissions a few times asking if my application has been received and everything is in order. I still haven't heard anything about an audition date or when I would receive an acceptance or denial letter. Is this normal?\n\nEdit: they emailed me today! Turns out the places I picked for my available audition places have been closed because of covid protocols. My audition is gonna be online and I'll get the information for when in 2-3 business days! I'm so relieved. Yay!",

Possibly earlier than that. It's worrisome though, this is my dream school and the only school I have yet to hear back from. I feel like I've had problems at every turn with the application process and am getting no feedback. I just sent one last email in hopes of clarification. It's been one day shy of 4 weeks since they told me I would get an audition date in 3-4 weeks. I know they're most likely having issues with covid stuff and possibly understaffing, but I can't help but get all nervous about it, you know?",

    "postText": "hey guys, i know i have been here before, and i really love this subreddit to see so many people trying to get in and people from berklee in general.\n\ni auditioned on 2nd nov, 11:30 AM(9 PM for me in Mumbai). I received an invite on my email to join a WebEx lobby for the online audition and interview. Hopefully, my internet connection was pretty good and it worked just fine. On video, it seemed that they were somewhere on the top floor of the building from where I could see the beautiful Boston skyline as the morning bloomed. I was auditioning on my digital piano and the audition room also had one. I think the guy who took the audition was a piano faculty member, I'm not sure.\n\nSo anyways, they wanted to hear my prepared pieces first. I played an improvisation of my own piece \"About You\" :  https://soundcloud.com/cash-official/cash-and-ferven-about-you and a cover of the avengers theme by Alan Silvestri. I think I messed up a note in the avengers cover, but other than that I played them really well.\n\nThey then asked me to play and sing back some pitches and melodies which were relatively easy, thanks to my relative pitch. \nAs both of us had a piano with us, they asked me to improvise on any random progression or melody I like, when I then proceeded to start harmonizing various progressions and notes in the key of G minor. He just said, \"Good, but not much of melody\" which is still haunting me.\n\nThen came the most terrifying part, the sight reading. To be honest, I can't sight read at all. I would need atleast 10-15 minutes to get one  bar right  and they didnt even give me the pieces during warmup. I ended up failing it and he just asked me to clap out the rhythm which i could. he then asked me to play a couple of chords, scales and asked some basic modal theory. \n\nThe interview was amazing too, I got asked basic questions about why berklee, inspirations, what my practice routine is, and what would i bring to berklee. she seemed to be impressed when i talked to her about my influences being ambient/drone/modern classical/post rock and that I was self taught in production and all the other stuff.\n\nIt was a greaat experience and I so hope to be accepted :D\nLet me know you guys' experiences and if i have a fair shot at getting in haha.\nthe pieces i submitted for the scholarship are:\n1-https://soundcloud.com/cash-official/serenade-1\n2-https://soundcloud.com/cash-official/decourage\n3-https://soundcloud.com/4lienetic/burn\n\n\n&lt;3\n\n",

It was both clefs or just chords and melody? I\u2019m worried that they won\u2019t deliver the materials during the warm up before the audition/interview \ud83d\ude25\n\nAnd btw, did you get some kind of scholarship? \n\nCongratultions in your admission tho!",

It was only one clef from what they showed me but it went up to both clefs. I didn't get any scholarship and that's what's worrying me :(. Thank you :D, I hope you get in too ",

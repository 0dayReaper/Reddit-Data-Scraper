    "postText": "I'm doing the transfer application for the Game and Interactive Media Scoring major, and I found nothing on the internet about this major expect the Berklee official website. I'm kind of nervous, does anyone know anythings about this major? Like, what's the student body of this major, is everyone already having experience in scoring? Do they only have experience with the music perspective, or do they also have experience with game development? And are the professors kind or helpful?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother question is about the scholarship - could someone help to tell me my scholarship chance please? \n\nI'm so anxious about it, any advice or suggestions please. I'm going to do audition in December and I'm still in the process of submiting supplemental matierals, I really want to go to the game scoring major.\n\nMy information in a short word:\n\n1. Weak in music theory (know basic stuff, don't know counterpoint and beyond)\n2. Was strong in classical piano (got 1st prizes for two international competitions, but didn't pratice for two years, just picked it up for a month)\n3. Weak in jazz improvisation (just starting to learn it for a month)\n4. Strong in reading music, strong in hearing melody, weak in hearing rhythm\n5. Kind of well-rounded (know stuff in computer science and STEM, kind of a influencer, have experience working with game devlopers, being a game developer and artist myself, got several national top prizes for games I worked on, directed and wrote scirpt for a short film and won 3rd prize in a NYU film competition)\n6. I'm an international Asian female student, I don't know if that will have impact on my admission result or not\n\nI'm an international student, so eager to get scholarship, currently studying in Purdue University, double majoring in Computer Science and Sound Design (for theatre). My primary instrument is classical piano, I attended Interlochen and precollege of Manhattan School of Music for high school. I was doing well with my piano and got 1st prizes for two international competitions, but I was kind of done with all those years of practicing, so I studied hard on the academic stuff and quited MSM during my junior year of high school, and eventually being accepted into Purdue.\n\nHowever, I discovered I don't belong to computer science and I'm not talented in it soon after. Then I found interest in game design and I self-studied composition for like half a year (from Junarary 2022 to now). I posted my music online (I have 5w followers on a Chinese Q&amp;A website), and ask indie game developers if they need original music, and I gradually made quite a lot of connections with them. \n\nI ended up wrote music and made sound effects for about 20 indie games (most of them are student works), 5 of them won top prizes in several national game competitions in China, and we are working on publishing them on Steam. I implemented Wwise for a few of them. I also made a short 2D game where I'm the main game developer, level designer, and artist. \n\nAll of my music are made for indie games, I don't have any piece outside game music, and most of them are kind of small orchestra added with synthesizing instruments and pads. I kind of stuck in the \"at least two composition pieces in sheet music\" for the supplemental material, I feel like my orchestration is so terrible and I don't know how to put all those percussion I wrote on the score (I used lots of marimba, vibraphone, glockenspiel, etc.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for everyone reading this post, I really love game scoring and I really want to get into Berklee with scholarship, this is my only chance to get back into the music track after quited Manhattan. Could someone please give any suggestion or advice on anythings? Thanks so much!!",

            "comment": "Hi! I think you have an outstanding chance of receiving a scholarship. Knowing advanced music theory, such as counterpoint, is definitely not expected of entering students, and they place much more value on performance and portfolio elements. I'd definitely focus on working on your improvisation skills as it can definitely help with balancing your portfolio, but as a prospective game scoring major you should probably be fine!",

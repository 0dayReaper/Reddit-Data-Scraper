            "comment": "How loud or quiet of the PA really depends on the professors, the chances are most likely quiet but loud enough for you to hear the music, velocity and stick control are keys here and you will be accompanied with an acoustic piano when asked to improvise. Good luck with your audition!",

When I finished the auditioner told me that he thought the PA might be too quiet, but left it to see if I would play with dynamics. Hope this helps.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone. Today I had my online audition and I wanted to share my experience since I know some other people have done the same. I played  piano for my audition piece, which was Mess Around by Ray Charles. Though nerves got me and made me make a tiny mistake or so, I felt good overall. The sight reading portion was a bit rough for me, since I\u2019m not trained in it, but after slowly getting through they asked me to identify and play some chords and that was a breeze. I did some improv over a jam based on Chameleon by Herbie Hancock, and my ear training went really well! The interview was great also, and I just talked about my involvement in local bands in my area, and explained that I wanted to major in something along the lines of jazz studies or theory and composition. The staff were really kind and welcoming, and they help a lot to take some stress off the experience. To the other people auditioning, good luck! And don\u2019t overthink too much. You got this! If anyone wants to talk about their experience with auditions, please feel free!",

Learn the changes and just how to play over it in general. They\u2019ll ask you if you have anything in mind from the website. Just try your best, and relax! Everyone is really nice in the audition process, and if you have classical training, I\u2019m sure you can do it",

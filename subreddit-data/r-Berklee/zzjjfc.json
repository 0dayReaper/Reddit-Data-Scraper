I gained a lot of life long friends that I still talk to every day and it helped push me into applying. I did my audition there and got in. \n\n So many cool workshops, seminars, events, jamming, and performing you can do with like minded people. If you\u2019re over 18, you won\u2019t have curfew so you can go out and come back to your dorm any time at night. Super fun! I say it\u2019s worth the experience.",

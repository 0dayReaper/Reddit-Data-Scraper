    "postText": "So basically,\n\nI have zero financial backing from family, (very lower class)\n\nI\u2019m a GED kid with a bad GPA. I\u2019m 23 now with an excellent portfolio, full composition experience, engineering experience, show experience, marketing and business experience with industry connections that I\u2019ve made from hand. Over roughly 200,000 streams in credits so far. \n\nI really want to do this to meet more people, make connections and sharpen my songwriting and skill sets. And honestly I\u2019m just in a lonely place in my life, I just cannot fathom how to afford such an expensive tuition and how I should move forward.\n\nI know I can apply for scholarships, but that can only do so much and it\u2019s 50 grand per semester? \n\nIt also appears that there are no community colleges I can start at in my state to transfer general ed credits from to be able to only focus on music while I\u2019m there. \n\nI feel like in terms of acceptance I have a decent chance at passing the bar through my work and potentially the audition as I\u2019m fluent in multiple instruments but, it\u2019s really the finances here. \n\nI\u2019m just curious if anyone else in here has been in a similar situation and has made it work\n\nOr if this just sounds like a bad idea since I\u2019m already on my own musical path (I\u2019m not trying to sound uppity with my credits and experience it\u2019s just where I\u2019m at right now)",

            "comment": "I feel you. I know how difficult it is considering the tuition and your situation. I suggest you give applying and auditioning a try. If you\u2019re amazing at theory and your music skills, then you have a shot at getting a merit based scholarship if I\u2019m not mistaken. I don\u2019t exactly know the requirements are for a scholarship, but just showcase your passion in the best way you can and you\u2019ll have a chance. I know this is not the best advice, but I\u2019m just saying it doesn\u2019t hurt to try auditioning.\n\nI also suggest that you write a really nice scholarship letter and create a digital portfolio to send to them. In the application, there will be a section where you could share your work and online presence. Make sure you have everything ready to go before applying.\n\nI can\u2019t tell you if it\u2019s a bad path for you or not. I don\u2019t think anybody can or should. I\u2019ve said this a lot in my other comments here in this group: You get what you put into Berklee. If you have a passion for this school and think it\u2019s right for you, do it. You\u2019ll likely come out of this school with more connections and skills compared to doing it on your own. But this will only happen if you put in the effort.\n\nYou go to Berklee for the people and connections. You\u2019ll learn from students more than you\u2019ll learn from professors. The professors are super nice and teach well so you\u2019ll learn quite a bit from them too of course. \n\nI\u2019ve been a student with Berklee since 2014. I\u2019ve done online and last year I did a summer program so I\u2019m familiar with the professors. I\u2019m starting my first year undergrad on campus in less than 2 weeks. \n\nHaving said that, you should apply for summer semester because it\u2019s cheaper. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. \n\nLastly, in regards to funding your tuition, there is the merit based scholarship, third party scholarships (can get one through your church), private student loans, and FAFSA. You will also be considered for a Thrive Scholarship while you are attending if you show high academic and artistic achievement. Keep your GPA up and do really well and there is a chance that you\u2019ll get some more aid.",

            "comment": "Totally agree with the first poster. With a few exceptions, scholarships are based on merit....meaning musicianship...so audition and supplementary application material is the key. But also definitely fill out the FAFSA if your financial situation is tight..\n\nIf you do get in, you can get extra $$ for good grades, performances and oftentimes professor recommendations.This happened to me years ago and to my daughter this year.\n\nGood luck. Berklee is an amazing place but boy is it expensive. I honestly would never recommend that someone  go there and pay full price if it meant burying yourself in loans.",

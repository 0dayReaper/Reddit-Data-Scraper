    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am applying to Berklee for the early action deadline on November 1st. I am still not sure what piece I should perform for my audition.  I plan to major in Songwriting, and I have a few original songs I am considering performing, but the melodies are quite simple and don\u2019t showcase my abilities very well. I was a theatre kid in high school, and I believe my voice is best showcased through musical theatre songs. I have one MT song picked out that I could (and want to) audition with. However, since I want to attend Berklee for songwriting, would it be better to sing a contemporary song or an original? Is it best to sing a song that showcases my vocal abilities the most or a song that represents the type of music I want to pursue at Berklee? Thanks!",

            "comment": "I heard from some others that for a vocal audition you want something that showcases your vocal ability off more rather than your own original work. I applied under composition and submitted about 40 minutes worth of my own original music (3 different multi movement pieces) but I got in for the performance of my violin solo. Performing well and doing a song that is technically advanced is the most important part of your audition.",

I also went in wanting to major in Songwriting but I really wanted to try and showcase everything I could do when I went in for my audition so I sang bits of a Beatle song while playing guitar, bits of a Childish Gambino song while playing piano and then I did an original too. The audition is designed to make you feel as comfortable as possible and the faculty are all really awesome at being able to tell if Berklee is a good fit for you. They'll know exactly the stuff to look for when you're there. Good luck!",

            "comment": "I was in a similar situation as you last year! I think the best thing would to chose a favorite contemporary song that is very similar to theatre. However, I know a few people who have gotten in singing a MT song. However, I would recommend what i said. Singing an original isn't the best idea. Show them what you're capable of, and when you get in, you have to \"audition\" (its rating your abilities with sight singing/performance but it lowkey feels like an audition) again your first semester to see what classes best suit you &amp; what style you want to study in a PL. I'm currently working on Musical Theatre stuff with my PL.",

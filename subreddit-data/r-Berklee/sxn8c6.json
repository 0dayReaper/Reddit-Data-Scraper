    "postText": "Hello, I have a question. So for some context, I\u2019m in 11th grade (from India), have been learning guitar since I was young, and do finger style now, and put videos of me playing on YouTube. I haven\u2019t done any grades in guitar though since I have bounced between teachers a lot, although I can read tabs and staff notation quite well. I have done up till grade 5 in Western music theory, and got a 95% on the grade 5 exam. I can play the basics on piano. I am also quite into production, and have quite a bit (growing number) of original EDM music. I am also learning orchestration right now, hindustani (Indian) classical singing, and tabla playing (hindustani classical percussion). I plan to give exams for these by the end of 2022. Additionally, I am doing IB for 11th and 12th grade, and I am on track to get a predicted grade of around 90-95% for my final 11th-12th grade score. My 10th grade final (board) result was also 95% (53/56). I don\u2019t have a lot of live performances (none to be exact, where I do any solo), and I don\u2019t have any grade qualifications in guitar.\n\nPs. I also didn't take music for a subject in 11th and 12th as my school doesn't offer it, but I took it from primary years to 10th grade, and did the board exam for 10th grade music.\n\nSo that was a lot of info, but I really want to know what people think about my chances to get in for a composition or music production major. I am also thinking about doing a double major, but that depends on my finances. I also wanted to ask what my scope for scholarships is, because I am an international student, but my family is quite well off, however payment for college has some limits. I want to apply for the fall 2023 batch.\n\nMy final questions :\n\n* What do you think my chances of getting in are?\n* What do you think my scope for scholarships is considering what I mentioned above?\n\nThis is my portfolio of published work till now : [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hS\\_Dp70N7zZQlkAU1nVIV\\_bOi3fMleprZZf6XDQeOH0/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hS_Dp70N7zZQlkAU1nVIV_bOi3fMleprZZf6XDQeOH0/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThank you for reading, and sorry for the bulk of text :)",

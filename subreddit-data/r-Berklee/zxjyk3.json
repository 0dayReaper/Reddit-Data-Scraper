I know I want to get into the Boston area eventually and get a master\u2019s, but I just barely scraped by in my lessons at FSU.\n\nDoes anyone have any helpful tips for applying for this program or any advice for boosting other aspects of the application such as the resume etc?",

As someone who grew up in a town with a music school and music Ed program (IU Bloomington) and explored many conservatory programs, I don\u2019t think Berklee is up to snuff. Many of the profs are part time and there aren\u2019t many research or outreach programs. What makes Berklee special are its programs in popular music and jazz, not traditional music courses of study. Unless you are interested in becoming a jazz educator, I would think twice before getting your masters. Of course, make the decision that\u2019s right for you, but do your research.",

Just do that shit at an affordable state school and you'll be able to show 9 year olds how to play a C on a saxophone just the same way as they'd show you in ANY music program across the globe.   \n\n\nPeople go to Berklee to get into the music business.  They use it to network.  To study with high-level players.  For music ed?    \n\n\nYou may as well just cut ME a check for $150k and call it a day.  What an absurd waste of money.",

I\u2019m a different major and if shit don\u2019t work out, I\u2019m going back for a masters in education (probably not berklee to be fair). Wanna know why? Benefits, pension, regular salaried income, retirement plans.",

Find a better hobby dude",

Go to UMass Lowell or any of the other state schools that can get you EXACTLY where you need to be but for THOUSANDS less.\n2. No shit.  See point 1.\n3. Ok, fine.  See point 1.\n4. Connections with music educators? You act as if this field is some treasure trove of opportunity.  You're going to probably be getting into teaching smelly kids how to play Hot Cross Buns for a few years and eventually get yourself into showing less smelly kids how to perform as a full ensemble in one of the trust fund cities in the state where the kids are going right to their horseback riding or tennis lessons after band/orchestra rehearsals.\n5. Studying with incredible musicians won't make you a better teacher. Not sure where you made that connection.  Teaching is about communicating your ideas in a clear and concise way.  Even Berklee instructors have a hard time with that conversation because while they are great musicians, often times they are TERRIBLE communicators and TERRIBLE teachers.\n\nYou do you, man.  If you think going to Berklee is going to help you chase your dream down of being a music educator, no one is going to stand in the way of that except you and especially not some random asshole on Reddit.    \n\n\nJust know this - been there, done that.  Been there, DOING that.  I do everything under the sun.  Berklee isn't the place to learn how to be an instructor.  Nearly every teacher on that campus will tell you that you need two things to get into Berklee - a pulse and a check book.  After that, your talent and inquisitive nature will guide the way.  You can save a TON of money by being more thoughtful about where you want to get a masters. There are plenty of programs that will get you that paper.",

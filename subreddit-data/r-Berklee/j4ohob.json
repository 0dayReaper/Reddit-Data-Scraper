That said, CWP is great for if you're looking to do a lot of modern writing (think arranging for RNB stars); Jazz Composition is what it says on the tin; Composition hews closer to traditional styles of composition and especially orchestration; finally, Film Scoring is about learning how to use all sorts of compositional styles and techniques in relation to visual media.",

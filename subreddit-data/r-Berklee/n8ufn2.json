I am particularly interested in Berklee, and I would like to do something that involves piano or choral work. Does anyone have any recommendations on certain programs or know whether they are worth the tuition?",

However, if you are there just to \"learn\" materials...I might want to look at other schools? Frost, Drexel, NEU...etc.",

            "comment": "No. No mic can drastically improve or worsen your vocal performance, unless the mic you\u2019re using is low-quality or broken. That rests solely on your talent, your technique with the mic, your mixing skills, and the acoustics of the room you\u2019re in. If you\u2019re just starting with recording, I\u2019d suggest buying an SM58 (common, simple, cheap, and hardy, industry standard workhorse performance mic), a simple mic stand, and maybe some acoustic foam.",

There\u2019s also some other softwares that some people rave about (Reason, Reaper, Cubase). I don\u2019t have experience with them but I\u2019m pretty sure one or two of them might be free? I\u2019ve also mixed a whole album in FLStudio. Not recommended, but if you happen to know that software already, that\u2019s a solid option too.",

That said, if you are just now kind of getting into it I would recommend starting with Reaper. It is very powerful and an incredible value.

It\u2019s pretty expensive ($1200) but it was worth the money in every way. hands down the best mic I\u2019ve ever used, and very easy to mix :)\n\nA cheaper option would probably be the audiotechnica AT4040. I had that before I got the bomblet and I used it on many many projects. It\u2019s also a very good mic and much cheaper than the bomblet at $300 :)",

    "postText": "i got in in december and got a merit scholarship but am still waiting to hear about need-based aid from the FAFSA and would only be able to go if i got a pretty decent amount. im fairly eligible for aid and if the berklee net price calculator i just did is accurate in the amount of aid i receive then that\u2019s the only way i would be able to go. that being said, does berklee usually give our sizable amounts of federal aid / grants / loans? or do they just expect you to rely on the merit scholarships?",

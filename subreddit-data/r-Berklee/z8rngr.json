    "postText": "I'll be auditioning on piano. I've gone through the practice material Berklee has provided online. It's got a lot of chords that I'm not used to playing, let alone sight reading. \nMy question is does the sight reading part have a lot of different chords and if it does, what can I do to make myself better at it? Are there some selected songs or something that they chose from that I can practice? \n\nFor improvisation, will I have to play the progression too or will there be an audio file? Those clips have got a lead instrument playing too. I'm hoping it's just a backing track for the audition. \n\nAny tips for improvising? Especially for piano. I'm a classical player so you can guess how good I must be at it. Practicing blues currently. \n\nP. S. Someone here said they sent some recordings for a scholarship (4 years ago) it's changed now, right? Like, only the audition and interview decides that.",

I remember my sight reading had a mixture of traditional sight reading (all the notes written out for you) and lead sheet sight reading. A general of idea of how to read lead sheets would be best. To improve young lead sheet reading, you'll need to know the theory behind the harmony and then start by writing everything out. And then practicing the common patterns won't be a bad idea either. \n\nImprov comes from ear training - you'll need to hear the notes, in relation to the harmony, in your head, then translate it to notes on the piano. To learn more about preparing for berklee's ear Training, go to www.mastermusic.online\n\nLet me know if you have any questions, and good luck!!",

To improve, practice soloing to backing tracks on YouTube. I recommend listening to red garland\u2019s piano and how he develops simple ideas \nJust keep practicing and researching!",

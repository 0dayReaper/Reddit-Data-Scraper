Everyone has to handwrite notation for homework and legibility is not usually a grading criteria. I brought an arrangement to my audition and I thought it helped me.",

However, i kind of doubt that it would give bonus points during an exam.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to learn the notation software (during my time it was Finale) anyway, so might as well get a head start.",

            "comment": "Back in the day Music Notation was a required class. Mark McGrain (IIRC) who wrote the book could literally lecture for two classes on the different types of pencils you should use and the pros and cons.\n\nAs much as a PITA the class was if you showed up and did the homework you got an A. The textbook is worth its weight in gold and is wonderful as a resource for when you need to write something out by hand, which many times is faster than doing it on the computer.  \n\n\nThe notation above is pretty, but I see some mistakes just glancing at it. For example, the staff on your C 16th note is way too high (should only be one octave) and the sus 4 next to it wouldn't have a # written next to it because the C before it does. Also, the staff on those is almost in the middle of the note.  \n\n\nAgain, it looks nice but to anyone who knows notation those errors would be glaring. Maybe get a copy of McGrain's book and look up a few things to make sure you're writing things correctly.  \n\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Music-Notation-Berklee-Guide-McGrain/dp/0793508479](https://www.amazon.com/Music-Notation-Berklee-Guide-McGrain/dp/0793508479)",

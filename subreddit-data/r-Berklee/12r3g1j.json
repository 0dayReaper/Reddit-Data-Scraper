    "postText": "Current or past Berklee NYC students: Do you like the MA program? \n\nI\u2019m interested in applying, specifically to the writing and design for musical theater specialization, but I\u2019d love to hear from students from the other two specializations as well. If you have any comments about the professors and curriculum, if you feel the program is worth the cost of tuition, how the Berklee NYC facilities are, etc., that would be great. Thanks!",

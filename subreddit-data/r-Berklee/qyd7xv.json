In the case you end up applying for Spring 2023, they will move your application to Fall 2023 when that opens up.",

This is because roughly all the on-campus housing has been filled out by students that started in the Fall semester.  If you live off-campus you won't receive meal plan since they come with the housing cost.  They do offer on-campus housing for Spring, but the space is mostly filled.  You would probably need to submit your housing tuition as soon as possible, but even so the chances is still slim.",

What are some other reasons it's not a good option?\nIs it actually not a good option?\n\nAnd should OP apply for spring or wait for an year?",

The downside is like you said, the housing space.  There is almost no chance of you getting on-campus housing.  Berklee's undergraduate population exceeds the amount of rooms on-campus they have for students.  A majority of students here live off-campus in apartments.\n\nThe housing is fairly the biggest downside, some might include friend groups or having trouble making friends as a lot of friend groups have already been established at the beginning of the Fall semester.",

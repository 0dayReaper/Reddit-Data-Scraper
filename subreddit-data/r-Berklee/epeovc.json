    "postText": "Hey all, I had a few questions about the aspire 5 week performance program.\n\n1. As there is no audition for admittance does essentially everyone who applies and pays the tuition get in?\n2. What is the turnaround time on admission?\n3. It seems like the program is targeted towards high school students. Would this be suitable for a working professional (pursuing music as a hobby) who is around 30?\n\nThanks!",

I think there's some older folks who do it, but it really is 99% high schoolers from what I recall. Not that you can't do it, or won't get something out of it, but it seems socially a bit awkward.",

They usually range from $100-$1000 depending on the college.  It's basically a way of saying that you accept the offer of enrollment into their school.\n\nIf you don't send a deposit by the due date (which is May 1st for Berklee for entering Fall semester students), they will think you declined the offer to attend Berklee.  Don't worry, the tuition deposit will be deducted from your actual tuition bill.",

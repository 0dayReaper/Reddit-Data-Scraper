If it\u2019s the same ones, I feel you- but at the same time, a good player should be fine through nearly anything and that itself in an important lesson. If you botch an audition, it wasn\u2019t the amp\n\nBringing your own amp to an audition like that makes you look like a Prima Donna. If I was watching auditions and someone brought an amp, if they were not an absolutely stellar player in every way, I\u2019d count their ego against them.",

    "postText": "I got accepted to Berklee online for songwriting for fall 2022. I deferred my admission to fall 2023 so that I can finish my associates this fall. I\u2019m just curious to know if Berklee is actually worth it? I know it\u2019s a private school but it\u2019s a non profit so they\u2019re not really \u201cscammers\u201d are they? Considering how ridiculously expensive their in person programs are I feel like the college is, in general, money hungry maybe? Is the degree worth anything or does it mean anything to others? The online program only cost as much as a California state university (where I live) so maybe that\u2019s more so worth it right? I want to be a lyricist or a producer or even use any newfound knowledge in the educational field to teach writing and production to kids.\nWhat did you do with your degree and how helpful was it to have it from Berklee rather than another school?\n\nTLDR: is Berklee online worth it for aspiring lyricists/producers/educators or are there better ways to go about this path",

I wouldn\u2019t depend on having Berklee on your resume opening any doors for you. It\u2019s possible, but not guaranteed. Most people in the music industry do not care where you went to school, and depending on the field don\u2019t care if you went to school at all. You may make connections while at Berklee that may help you though. The only major that you\u2019ve listed that I would even consider going into debt for would be one of the two major production majors, because your DTI ratio will be more manageable that way if you lean into a career in production. I would not go to Berklee for education if you need student loans. The program is great but the DTI is not worth it and there are much cheaper comparable programs. For lyrics, I honestly just recommend reading Pat Pattison\u2019s (Berklee professor) books and taking some of his Berklee online courses.",

They are so much cheaper and you can pick the brains of the professors and network around almost as much as in person. However, you do miss out on the in person experience, but a lot of the same resources are available if you know what you\u2019re after! I\u2019m graduating next year and it\u2019s been the best for work, my mental health, and overall well-being especially during the height of the pandemic",

I\u2019ve accumulated 10+ semesters so far and attendance hasn\u2019t been a requirement which let me tell you is a HUGE RELIEF when working even part time. Unless you\u2019re going directly for a Songwriting the most they might require is a piano. I know it\u2019s been heavily Mac/Apple computer based for the most part although they have windows alternatives for their lessons. I\u2019m in the Interdisciplinary Music Studies program and currently deciding on graduate programs Musicology/History. I never needed to play an instrument, but I chose electives with piano and guitar to strengthen and get some easy credits. It\u2019s pretty easy repertoire, but you do learn a new piece every week so practicing a little every day is a given. Like I said I work and was still able to do piano and guitar at the same time with a little bit of background. They top you off at 4 classes (12 hours). They accepted a few transfer credits from a previous school and even without which I\u2019d be able to graduate in 3 years doing a couple summer classes.",

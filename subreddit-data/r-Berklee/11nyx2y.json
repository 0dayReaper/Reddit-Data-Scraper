    "postText": "So my first audition I went in too confident in my abilities that I didn't properly prepare for the moment. \n\nPrinciple Instrument: Guitar \n\nI chose to play and sing a song which wasn't my strength. This amplified my weaknesses instead of showcasing my best abilities\n. Also nerves caused me to be worse performing than when I was alone at home. \n\nMy song selection was poor as it was a rock song with a fairly straightforward progression.  It didn't show enough of my versatility as improvising was probably my strongest skill and I didn't even show them that aspect. \n\nSo I took a year off and focused on improving to get in. I got a private teacher again and strengthened my jazz chops. I spent time learning  to sight read as I couldn't sight read single note melodies, I only could comp chords. \n\nI also changed my piece to highlight the things that I bring to the table as a musician which is more than just my principle instrument. I wrote an original for the audition. I used a MPC 2500 to create my backing track live. This helped showcase my interest and skills in my eventual major Electronic Production &amp; Design. I played guitar over the MPC which showcased improv, using major and minor 7th chords and different inversions down the neck. And having the song's single note melody one that I could embellish live.\n\nThis is what eventually worked for me. Another suggestion I learned while there and what I started doing for my principle instrument proficiencies is playing Bach inventions as they are a good showcase of  instrument competence.\n\nHope this helps anyone for ideas on their own auditions!",

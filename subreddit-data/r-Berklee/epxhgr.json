Moving forward, your elective classes will largely dictate how much piano you will really be using. You will quickly learn here at Berklee, however, that a good producer is exceptionally talented at their instrument in addition to production. I would personally recommend keeping as proficient as possible during your following 4 semesters after the first 4.",

Do you think that it would be difficult st berklee to follow the classes?\n\nI've taught myself a lot since then, though. When I stopped my vest piece was fur elise but I learned 3rd movement moonlight sonata a few weeks ago.",

Use your knowledge of the piano to help you in classes (trust me, it helps). Having a visual/physical instrument is an enormous perk in your core music classes. \n\nYour private instructor will help you advance your instrumental skill, no matter what your level may be.",

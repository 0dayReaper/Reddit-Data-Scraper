    "postText": "Hi! I'm a Diploma international student. I have a few semesters left. I'm in a bit of an inflexion point. I could choose to make a big financial effort and change to Degree, or just continue with Diploma. I want to figure out if changing to Degree would be worth the money and time. My questions are:\n\n\\- Does having a Degree instead of a Diploma makes it easier to get a visa after graduation? Is it requiered for some visa?\n\n\\- Is having a Degree strictly requiered to teach?\n\n\\- Is having a Degree strictly required for doing a Masters?\n\n\\- Is having a Degree instead of a Diploma be a significant factor when looking for jobs?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you very much in advance for your help!",

With a prof diploma,  you get only a year after you graduate regardless of the major. It's hard to get an employment visa but if u have 3 years of experience it increases your chances.  or alternatively in those 3 years you could get familiar with the field and become an irreplaceable person in a company so much so they'll sponsor your visa\n\nYes degrees are generally required to teach at the higher level/ academic level  and for a masters. If you have a previous degree before getting this diploma or maybe finish your degree at another cheaper institute when you're done that will be enough also.  \n\nYou could opt to finish your lib art credits during the summer at some community college.  They can be added to your transcript even after matriculation.",

            "comment": "A degree is a building block for other options such as law school or a masters degree. A diploma is really just a piece of paper from Berklee, patting you on the back saying thanks for sticking around with us. \n\nIn the real world it means nothing and definitely won\u2019t get you a gig either. You\u2019re starving and sweeping floors regardless of what one you\u2019re going to get if you\u2019re looking to be an artist in any fashion. \n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t see why anyone would go that long in a school without a degree. The only difference when I was there was taking a few general education classes. Do those and walk away with something that\u2019s worth the most any school can give you in the arts. \n\nSide note, other than my friend from home who convinced me to go there, I have never played in a group with someone who went there and I\u2019ve had what some would call some success in the music industry; touring, endorsements, national press, radio &amp; television, etc.",

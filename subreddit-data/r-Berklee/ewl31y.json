    "postText": "I got the provisional admission, but I have SO many questions. \n\nOne thing I\u2019m considering right now is taking a tour of the campus and seeing if I can get more information there. Is it a good idea to do so and will I get more information on the 12 week program?\n\nAny other insight/tips about the 12 week program will help immensely! Thanks!\n\nEdit: would like to mention I\u2019m a college freshman, and I saw something like this on this subreddit from years ago, and someone said it was possible to graduate in 3 years rather than 4.  And the classes I\u2019m taking at college rn are basic liberal arts courses. (Comp 1, calc, history etc)",

I think it was when I explained something about being a transfer student. If I were to go through with this I would be able to graduate by 2023 cause I have a lot of liberal arts done and I would get the first semester out of the way.\n\nI also was a 3.9 GPA student in high school, had good letters of recommendations, and a pretty good portfolio that showcased my art. I also had a 3.8 GPA for my first college semester. \n\nNot too sure why I got this but the only problem is the money, I know lots of people go in debt after graduating Berklee, but I won\u2019t know if I get loans until I complete the summer semester.",

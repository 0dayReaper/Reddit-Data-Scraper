    "postText": "Hi, I'm coming to Berklee in the fall semester and I'm super worried about making friends and fitting in while I'm there.  I didn't get the chance to visit because of the pandemic and I couldn't go to the welcome events and I'm worried that I won't meet or click with anybody and I'll just end up being by myself.  Is anyone else feeling this way? And for current Berklee students is it easy to make friends?",

            "comment": "Worrying is not productive-- you double your trouble by worrying and then living through it.  Instead remind yourself look forward to this year.  There is just so much that can go right for you. It's going to be great! No one who knows you from middle school will be here to drag you down. And, it is never as easy to just up and introduce yourself to someone as when you're taking a class in college. You might have to take a **step out of your comfort zone**, but go ahead and give your phone number to classmates, and say let's meet to study for the exam or rehearse or whatever you have going on. \n\n**Say yes to invitations**, even if you have to show up alone. There will be many, many people in the same boat. Complement other students on their: hair, t-shirt, shoes, laptop stickers etc. Sure, you probably won't meet your best pal ever this way, but who knows, this person might introduce you to that person.  \n\nAlso, get involved. Student clubs, getting a part-time job, or volunteering for a professor are great ways to get to know people who are pretty much required to introduce themselves. If you hide in your room, you can make your worries come true. You have the power to enjoy yourself. If someone rejects you, what of it? They're probably a jerk! Move on and try again.",

The classes are small, your roommates and floor mates will naturally fall into place unless you\u2019re a real hermit.\n\nYou can always join bands with people outside of school who played Boston. This I strongly suggest if you truly want to do something. Half of my college year friends didn\u2019t even go to Berklee.",

Try to not say yes to as many invitations as possible and don\u2019t be afraid to make the first move. Feel free to message me on here if you want to chat. I\u2019m an incoming freshmen as well. Best of luck!",

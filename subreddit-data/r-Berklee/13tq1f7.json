You will certainly not get a full ride, which is incredibly rare, without them. I knew people who got Grammies for their albums 3-4 years after Berklee who didn\u2019t get full rides. \n\nNone of Berklee\u2019s ear training requires perfect pitch. Excellent relative pitch however is mandatory, and something I struggled with when combined with sight singing. \n\nCan you at least sing and you could apply as a singer? You\u2019ll not get a scholarship likely if you haven\u2019t been seriously investing time there, but you might be able to get in. \n\nKeep in mind, almost everyone at Berklee was the #1 most talented musical student in their county/high school.\n\nI\u2019m personally of the opinion that the best producers are all at least passable musicians on one or more instruments: George Martin, Trent Reznor, Brian Eno, etc",

You have to be proficient in an instrument (including voice or midi controllers/Electronic digital instruments) to have any chance to be accepted, let alone with a full ride. There\u2019s a single track with no instrument experience needed but A. It\u2019s a music business major and B. you\u2019ll undoubtedly be bullied and ostracized from the Berklee community at large.",

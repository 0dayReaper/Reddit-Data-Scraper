Gonna reapply for spring sem 2024.\n\nWhat did you do that you believe got you the scholarship?\n\nAlso, did you attach supporting materials? If yes, then what? \n\nIt would also be great if you could put your opted major in the application. \n\nAnyone got good scholarship just because of the audition and interview? \n\nI have good grades, nailed my prepared piece (had poor audio, tho they liked it), improvisation was good, sight reading was awful and ear training was ok. The interview could have been better.\n\nApart from improving these things I can't seem to think of what could get me a good scholarship. Do spring applicants get more scholarships in general due to less applications?",

            "comment": "I got 23k a year for merit, honestly do not know how. My primary instrument was viola (major: music therapy) and my auditioners were both non string majors, and I guessed correctly on 7 out of 8 chord recognition things and the auditioner said that that was further than anyone they had that day, so I assume weird instrument + ear training did the trick? For supporting materials I made a video instead of the essay talking about my goals and how they aligned with berklee. Ultimately i decided not to go bc it was still stupid expensive, good luck to you though!!",

Only rent and other expenses would be uncovered. Could also apply for FAFSA and got more money for freshman year. So like 30k for first year and ~15k sophomore year onwards. \n\nYou could work on campus and basically cover rent.",

It wasnt just the money that made me not want to go though-- it wasnt guaranteed that I would have gotten into the music therapy program, so I'd spend the first year basically doing nothing relating to my field. I found a state school that had the program I liked that was 4 years instead of 5, a smaller music department that felt more close and tight knit than berklee, and a more down to earth vibe that I was looking for. Berklee was never my \"dream school\" like a lot of people-- it was more of a shoot my shot and try it out, so I didn't look into a lot of the fine details and seriously consider what it would be like. Glad to help you out though!",

            "comment": "I got a full tuition scholarship somehow, I don\u2019t think my soloing was any better than any other person\u2019s (tenor sax) but I had clear goals in mind that I stated during the interview, I did really well on the sight reading, and I did really well with the ear training part. For that, if I remember correctly they would play some short line and I\u2019d have to play it back. I think there was also a part where they asked me to identify chords and I had a pretty decent grasp on that. Considering the other people I know that got good scholarships, I think aside from technical skills they look for passion and drive. If u can make that very clear during your interview and u can talk about how music has influenced your life and the things you are doing to further your craft, you should do fine. But of course, I have no clue how they actually decide these things. Also, this was in 2019 that i auditioned (So long ago ahhhhh). \nAs for supporting materials, I didn\u2019t have much aside from some performance videos and some credentials from awards I won in highschool. I also had good grades in school and had a decent amount of AP credits but I  don\u2019t think they care much about your academics. Also, i applied for Music Therapy but since they don\u2019t make you commit right away, I ended up choosing CWP (and recently added IRP as a double major since it\u2019s new). \n\nAnyways, good luck on your next one!",

After that experience, I worked on my ear training with the goal of reapplying. The second time I auditioned I felt so much more confident with ET. Got in with a scholarship!",

            "comment": "hey there, i got 15k a year (not spectacular- but pretty alright!). i opted for the professional music major with marimba as my primary instrument. i gave no supporting materials, so it was all based on my audition and interview. grades are pretty good as well. my audition went decent- my prepared piece was solid, couldve been better, definitely couldve been worse. call and response was really good for me, chord identification wasnt lol. sight reading was below average due to nerves and improv was about the same (im a classical percussionist\u2026 jazz improv hasnt ever been taught to me and they seemed to be a little understanding of that). as far as my interview went, i honestly did pretty good. one thing i did was write down all of the questions from the website and my responses to them and then practiced them aloud, as well as doing a mock interview with a friend the night before. \n\ni know its not much, but i hope this helps. im sure so much of it is also dependent on the scholarships offered to various primary instruments and majors and considering marimba is extremely niche, i think that worked in my favor in this case. you could always appeal for a chance at getting a scholarship as well!",

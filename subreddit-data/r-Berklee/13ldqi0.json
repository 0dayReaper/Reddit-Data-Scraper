And how should I go by for applying",

            "comment": "As far as I\u2019m aware, Berklee barely considers your Highschool grades for scholarships, and I doubt they care about your followers or how many tracks you\u2019ve made. What they will care about the most is the quality of the pieces you submit and your audition. You should focus on preparing your best audition work. Submit your best songs, be prepared to improvise and sight read as well as the solos. Regardless of academic success, if Berklee sees potential they will reward that.",

That said, if u get a full tuition scholarship you are required to keep a decent GPA in order to keep the scholarship. If u do happen to get bad grades tho and dip below the requirement, you do have the chance to talk with them and save it but it will be up to them. I also know some people that have grades below the required amount and haven\u2019t gotten contacted at all so idk how strict they are about it.\n\nAnyways, good luck on the audition!\n\nAlso, if u feel the need to explain ur grades in some application essay or the interview, you could go about it like \u201cyea those grades were bad but this last year of all A\u2019s is proof that I\u2019m determined to improve and I can reach my goals if I put my mind to it in the end\u201d or something like that",

I do know more people that have high scholarships that are close to full tuition though, so if u don\u2019t get it it\u2019s not the end of the world. Also, apparently u can increase ur scholarship amount over time but I personally don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s done it recently, one of my private instructors told me that he had done it when he attended Berklee 10 years ago or something like that",

But for the full ride supposedly they pay for ur dorm, for a new laptop, and for ur software bundle that u get for ur major (I think). I don\u2019t personally know anyone that has that one but I think I heard that it\u2019s limited to around 10 people for that one\n\nEdit: so I don\u2019t think they would also pay for plane tickets but if you were to get one then maybe they send u a more detailed list on what it can include",

If u get financial aid generally it\u2019ll cover the other smaller expenses and then u can get any leftover money from that sent directly to you. Dorms are really expensive, I forgot the exact price but most people (myself included) choose to live off campus after their first year. They also highly recommend buying a MacBook Pro with 16gb ram and 1 TB (or maybe 500 gb I can\u2019t remember) of space but depending on what specifically u want to do with music u don\u2019t need it. The software bundle varies by major, but it generally ends up being a really good deal bc most of the stuff is at a pretty good discount, it only sucks if u already have most of the stuff bc it\u2019s annoying contacting the people so that they don\u2019t charge u for the entire bundle. If u don\u2019t pay for the bundle though, most teachers will understand as long as u have something else that can perform the same operations. I\u2019m in CWP/IRP which are both tech heavy majors and so far the teachers haven\u2019t cared what plug-ins people use as long as u get the assignment done. There are times they ask for specific stuff but if u don\u2019t have the plugins then just talk to them and u can figure out an alternative. There might be things I\u2019m forgetting about but I think those r the major things money-wise. Also I hate Boston it\u2019s a really expensive place, also if u live off campus be prepared to get screwed over by realtors and horrible landlords. I would say it\u2019s worth it to attend school but after graduation I\u2019m OUT.\n\nIf u have any other questions feel free to ask though",

Right now I pay about $1300/month to live a 10 minute walk from campus and I have a roommate so total rent is about $2600, but then there\u2019s also utilities so I pay around $1400. Then ofc there\u2019s food costs and everything I don\u2019t even wanna look at how much it all costs overall \ud83d\ude2d if u live further out rent gets significantly cheaper tho but then you\u2019ll have to rely on transit to get to campus which generally works out fine but I just prefer to live a walkable distance. Near campus there aren\u2019t many cheap food options aside from Wendy\u2019s and 7/11. If u like pizza there\u2019s also a place called supreme pizza close by which costs about the same as the others.",

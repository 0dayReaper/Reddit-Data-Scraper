What instrument do you play?\n\nHere\u2019s some tips:\n+ Practice, practice and overpractice\n+ Be able to play without a warmup\n+ Exercise before you practice and bring up your heart rate, then get used to practicing with an accelerated heart rate\n+ Ask your friends and family to hear you play (and do it often) to get used to playing in front of others",

            "comment": "So, first of all I want to acknowledge that social can feel hard at Berklee. I just don't think there's the long term social structures that many other local universities/colleges have like Harvard and MIT. I also found so many Berklee students (circa 2002-2006 at least) were incredibly flakey, poor communicators (many didn't have phones in that time) and dropped out like flies.\n\nBut, you've got one thing in common with literally everyone at Berklee. You're all musicians!\n\nGet together with more people to explore music. Listen to music together (including stuff you know nothing about or think you don't like). Talk about music. Jam. Record. Learn new techniques.\n\nNo one will be offended or put off by you asking them about their instrument, their goals, etc. You can ask anyone \"What are you working on getting better at\"\n\nSo just like, find people in the halls waiting for classes. Ask them about what they are into. And then just keep it going. Be curious. Don't make it all about you. \n\nThis will create all sorts of opportunities for you.",

    "postText": "Could anyone help me understand which residential hall is the best/most fitting? \nI just got accepted into Berklee and I wanted to explore the residential hall options. After a considerable amount of time researching all buildings, I came to the conclusion that 160 Mass avenue is the most fitting one of them all. It's close to the campus, has 6 student lounges, a cafeteria and a gym. BUT it has no private bathrooms so that looks like a slight problem. I am looking for a double/triple room with only single beds. I still don't know the condition of the public bathrooms so I am still hesitant on this factor. Could anyone help me decide, please? Cheers.",

            "comment": "It really depends on what\u2019s most important to you - a modern building or having a private bathroom. For me, the private bathroom was by far the better choice, so I chose 150. \n\nPer being close to campus, both buildings are directly next to each other, and regardless of which building you live in, you\u2019ll still have access to the gym and the student lounges (all 6 of which are identical and on every other floor lmao). From what I hear from my friends in 160, the bathrooms are generally clean, but I still don\u2019t want to put myself at the mercy of other people. \n\nKeep in mind that after living in 150 for nearly two semesters at this point, there\u2019s a major drawback in that the soundproofing is TERRIBLE. Eventually you get used to it, but if you\u2019re someone who requires dead-silence to go to sleep, you may have a hard time at first.",

No AC (though that was to be fixed if I remember). best community on campus.\n\n98 - disgusting",

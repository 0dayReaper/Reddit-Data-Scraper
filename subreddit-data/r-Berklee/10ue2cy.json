    "postText": "My prepared piece is a complete transcription of a jazz song from start to finish including the solos. It's a standard chord progression so nothing crazy that the judges wouldn't be able to hear. I learned it completely by ear, so I don't have sheet music for it, but I'm wondering if I should write it out for the judges or if it isn't worth the effort. The entire thing is like 5 minutes long so it would be a ton to write out.",

            "comment": "Being able to write out transcriptions is a great skill to show off because you have 4 semesters of Ear Training but you will be able to test out of them if they think you could pass the tests for them but don't worry about that. They have heard it all, they have seen it all, so do yourself a favor and play to where your talents and what you've been working on shows. They probably already know the chord chart and melody unless it's a super obscure tune. You will have to read and improv some too but the fact that you transcribed a whole tune awesome, if you can write it out, it makes you look that much better and this is your scholarship audition too, (no pressure) so do yourself and favor, swing, play what you're comfortable and sound the best on (multiple styles and tunes are always great, style is less important because they want to see what it looks like when you are shining and killing it. Good luck, you got this. Steady consistent work on specific skills when you are practicing and so you can tell them that if they ask you what you are working on at the moment, don't try to outdo yourself because I'm telling you they've seen all the virtuosos and heard all the licks, and it would be pointless to go in there and exaggerate or try to play shit you think they want to hear n hopes they will be impressed, and then if you cant back it up, they will be able to tell immediately. Not saying you would do that but you wouldn't believe some of the stories or shit people pull when they get desperate.",

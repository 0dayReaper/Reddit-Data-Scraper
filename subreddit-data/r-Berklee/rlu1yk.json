    "postText": "Hello! I was recently accepted by Berklee! I want to major in music therapy but even with a partial scholarship, the cost of tuition is still very high and I\u2019m apprehensive about attending. Are there any current music therapy students there that would be able to tell me a bit more about the student experience of the program and if it\u2019s worth it? Thanks in advance!",

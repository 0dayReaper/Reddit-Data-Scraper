    "postText": "Basically my whole life revolves around music. My main instrument is the piano, however I wasn't taught the traditional way so I do not know how to read sheet music, but my improvisation skills, technique, and knowledge in theory is really good and I am learning more every day. I really want to major in Electronic Music Production and Design. I produce a lot of music on logic pro and I know a lot about it, and I basically do that all day. My question is, will I get accepted to berklee to study music production although I do not know how to read sheet music?",

Once you get here you\u2019ll definitely learn how to read but it\u2019s by far not the most important thing here. Take the 3 and a half years you have to get as good as you can because no matter what, it will be helpful to read, but remember not to stress!",

It\u2019s good to have an idea of what you want, but really you should focus on nailing your audition first. \n\nMake sure you can comp/solo over lead sheet changes. \n\nLearn the basics of music theory, you\u2019ll have to learn it to graduate Berklee so you should get started ASAP.",

I nailed the sight reading and that really helped my audition, it probably compensated for me not having great pitch. I ended up getting a 10K scholarship. \n\nI would focus on it a lot, but I wouldn\u2019t say that not knowing to read would be detrimental to your audition. Berklee understands people come from different types of musical training and they are mostly looking at your determination and motivation as a musician overall.",

That\u2019s a long time, and if you put focus and effort into it I am absolutely certain you can get good enough for Berklee.\n\nBut yes, in your time at Berklee you will have to read, no matter the major. You can be pretty bad at it to begin, but by the time Conducting 2 rolls around you need to be able to sight read multiple clefs and deal with time signatures etc",

Practice reading like you practice any other technique, making it routine. It\u2019s awesome you know yourself now, you have a lot of time to work on things. Try giving it 30 minutes everyday and in half a year max, you\u2019ll be able to read. Piano\u2019s not the easiest reading instrument, but it\u2019s a great skill to have. All the best!",

    "postText": "Hi, everybody. I was accepted to audition and interview for a bachelor in CWP but I can\u2019t understand what the audition consists of. I selected voice as my primary instrument so I assume the audition will consist of vocal improvisation, sight-reading, ear training and a vocal prepared piece. I just want to be 100% sure that this is what it is.",

I'm extremely upset that the administration hasn't said anything about how they're going to deal with this, and I think they need to know how upset we are. Please share this with everybody you know, whether it be students, staff, friends, family or otherwise. Also feel free to add other people's names to the list, if they agree\n\ngoogle doc link: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1\\_OsLw1B8HKZU8-4L1SjVHtj7cpKn3XJ5S9kHwolftIc/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_OsLw1B8HKZU8-4L1SjVHtj7cpKn3XJ5S9kHwolftIc/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI'm probably gonna make fliers with an easier way to add names tomorrow",

Plus, we're paying for housing, meal plans, and facilities we can't use\n\nedit: this is to keep us away from the Coronavirus, but it's still not fair that we have to pay for services we can't use",

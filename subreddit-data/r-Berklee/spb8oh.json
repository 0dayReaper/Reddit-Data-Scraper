He soon had more gigs than classes and moved to New York. And recording dates on Blue Note soon after.\n\nThere\u2019s teachers there that act like scouts and a lot of cats that can really play \u201cgraduate\u201d within a year or so with actual gigs. They people that were graduating, especially with performance degrees, were always meh. \n\nThis is a huge generalization and also I attended 30 years ago! But man, the graduating performance majors had to perform a showcase. We\u2019d attend them regularly and they were almost always\u2026 not good. All over the place stylistically, and not great in any of them. Just my experience!",

You have to really nail every part of your audition &amp; interview, though. I made a portfolio on Google sites to show them my composing and production ability, and I made sure to get great letters of recommendation, etc.\nHaving good grades / test scores also makes a big difference if you have either of those.\nGood luck!",

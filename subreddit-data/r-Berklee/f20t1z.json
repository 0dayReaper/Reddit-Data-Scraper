That being said, I know a lot of the appeal of the school is the social/networking scene. I'm worried I won't fit in. If someone could give me an unbiased description of the types of people or general archetypes that attend I would be super super appreciative. I know it's not politically correct but it's something that had been really weighing on me. Thank you to anyone that answers you'll be making a huge difference in determining my future!",

            "comment": "I felt like my time there was more like highschool than highschool was.... Others here are right, college is what you make of it, you will find your 'type' because the college takes all kinds, and ultimately everyone is a musician, so we all bond through a common language.\n\nBut I definitely felt like students joined together based on music preferences. This was mostly true for the first semester, and goes away quickly - there was a jazz clique, a bluegrass tribe, a math rock crew, etc etc. Most people are very open and they know where you're coming from, because again, we're all musicians.\n\nThe best social advice I got early on was to make friends with people for their friendship, not for their music ability, their networking, or your perception of their 'status.' You'll like them for who they are instead of seeking people out for how they benefit you. Plus I can't tell you how many times I knew a good friend and was shocked when I finally heard them play",

As much as I'd love to think that way it hasn't been true in my past experiences. Thank you for this though and I hope it'll be my experience especially in high school but I know it won't be like hs.

            "comment": "This is an incredibly diverse place. As you might know, over one third of the student body is international. Beyond nationality, people here come from all kinds of upbringings both musically and otherwise. As such you\u2019ll find basically every genre you can imagine represented here. From EDM to math rock to jazz to pop-punk to gospel to country to Indian language tunes, Spanish language tunes and much more. I feel pretty confident that anyone would be able to find their people here. \n\nBerklee isn\u2019t very large by college standards, but it is quite big by music conservatory standards (pushing 5,000 these days). Don\u2019t be worried that you won\u2019t fit in I would say - we all reside in our own corners or weirdness, and most of us find friends in those corners too. But plenty of friends aren\u2019t in my \u201ccorner\u201d either. Living on campus for at least your first year helps this process immensely if you are able and might ease your concerns.",

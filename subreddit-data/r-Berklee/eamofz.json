I am a fourth semester Music Business Marketing major and I just took an ensemble this semester that was outside of the general elective credits. If you also check your degree audit on [my.berklee.edu](https://my.berklee.edu) it lays out all of the credits that you have taken/the ones you need to take and will show extra ensembles under the general electives column if you've fulfilled your general elective requirements.",

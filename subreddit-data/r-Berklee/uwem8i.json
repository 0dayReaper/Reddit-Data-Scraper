    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI'm already enrolled and paid up for the 5-week summer program at Berklee and am starting to have some thoughts that maybe some of you could shed a little light on.\n\nI'm 26, have been drumming for over 10 years, play in cover bands at gigs for a living and it's basically been the main job and source of income I've had since forever. With all that said, I've never had any \"professional\" training and probably lack a lot of knowledge in theory and other stuff like that. Plus I'm looking forward to the electives like music production in Ableton live, music business, songwriting, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom what I understand, they should be able to place me in a group that actually challenges me even with these many years of drumming under my belt right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso should I expect the vast majority of the students to be like a lot younger than me? Not that there's anything wrong with that, I'm just wondering. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, staying on campus...I saw that sometimes they put you with a roommate and sometimes not...anyone know if they try to room people based on age too, or is there a chance I'll be roommates with someone 10 years younger than me haha...once again not inherently a bad thing, but there could be some differences there lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know if you have any insight on any or all of the above.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

I\u2019m attending the five week this summer and I\u2019m 23! \n\nI had the same fear but from what I know they have placement tests and put you in classes according to your skill level. \n\nI think since its a summer program, mostly teens attend to earn college credit and they can then also apply to Berklee for undergrad. But I\u2019m sure there will be people in your age bracket. \n\nAs for staying on campus, I think they also put you according to your age so you wont end up with the younger lot. Got the information from their website. The nicer buildings are allotted to the teens, which is why I personally got an off campus housing. \n\nIf you need any more help or need someone to speak to then you can reach out to me on my instagram @annasalmandar. \n\nHope this helps!",

I had a meeting with a housing advisor at Berklee and they said that I will most likely be in a separate building with people my age group. I suggest you call the housing/accommodations department and speak to someone about any concerns you may have. Since it\u2019s the summer, they have more rooms available so you can most likely request to be separate or with a roommate.",

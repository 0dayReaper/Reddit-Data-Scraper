But on the page with information for International students, it also mentions the Duolingo test option. Which is way cheaper.\n\nIs this true or the situation changes depending on the student's first language and origin? does it has to be with the type of degree one is pursuing? In case is that, I'm entering as an undergraduate first year student.",

I made some amazing connections that I am so grateful for its truly an amazing experience. Right now I am preparing for my masters degree. I learned a lot, one thing I learn is how important friendship is and to never give up. Good friends and the people you hangout with reflect on who you are and what you are to become. Good friends will always have your back and call you for gigs and keep you busy! My favorite part, being surrounded by people who are almost exactly like you and not feeling weird.  I am not so worried about my debt but I know it's going to be fine. Berklee is the only school where you can being playing with a Bouzouki player and someone from turkey will join in on their micro tonal guitar and then their friend who plays qanun will join in and you'll be playing Mediterranean jazz.",

If so, how do you find these opportunities? I'm a 7th semester Songwriting major (and a solid pianist) and I have yet to get a single legitimate paid opportunity (outside of a birthday party I played from a facebook group post last year, but that was once and $70). I have a lot of friends in a lot of fields, and I'm confident in my ability (and, for the record, people's perception of my ability), but no one is contacting me to work on their projects or anything like that. Any tips you could give on turning this degree into value would be much appreciated. \n\n(I know it's difficult and I know pickings are thin, but it *is* done by those with enough dedication and skill. The answer people give to \"how do/did you make money from this\" is usually something along the lines of \"a lot of work,\" which is pretty vague and unhelpful to someone who's months away from actually trying to do it.)",

I started a freelance business doing video and photo work for lots of bands and artists at Berklee. [www.skiladikostudios.com](https://www.skiladikostudios.com) \n\nWith that being said money from music for me as a performance major came from gigs. I played a few gigs with songwriters in Boston and made some money. Now I am trying to go back for my masters in Jazz. If you are really good people will contact you and if you are well prepared they will continue to call you for gigs. I learned a lot what not to do in a professional setting when playing Guitar. I have had some many things go wrong at gigs that taught me so many good lessons. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso like I said connections are key. Finding a job won't be super easy but If you take time and really plan things out like budgeting and figuring out how much you need to make a year/hour you'll be fine. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother things is don't let anyone or anything slow you down. If you need to find people for a show etc. make sure they want to do it. Don't hire people who are doing it just for the money or exposure. Those are the people who won't give a fuck about the gig and show up late to rehearsals or just not show up at all. Regardless of how good you are if you're not showing up to rehearsals and not showing commitment than you can fuck off and find another gig. Just remember you're the boss when it's your show!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand I do produce and would love to meet you and collab. I would love to play your music and gig out. I'll be back in Boston soon and I'm hoping to do a lot when I get back. If there's one thing I regret is not connecting with lots of people from my hometown NYC and not connecting with as many songwriters as I would have liked to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStart connecting with people who will be wherever you will be after Berklee. For me that is New York!",

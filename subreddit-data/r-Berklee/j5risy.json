    "postText": "Hey guys, I am very interested in applying/auditioning to this school for blues guitar and I am wondering about some specifics.\n\n1. I know there is a technical part for the audition - how much theory and chord building knowledge should I realistically have to know to get in? As far as chords go I am pretty basic, I know the 4 chord types (aug dim maj min) as well as how to add 7ths and 9ths, I get lost above that. As well, my knowledge of modes is extremely basic. \n\n2. I am pretty good at improv/listening call and response type things, and I also think my piece is killer (going to play either Satch Boogie or Always With Me Always With You by Joe Satriani) but I am worried about the sight reading. Is the piece very difficult? I can get by but if it is a pretty hard piece I feel like I may falter pretty hard. \n\n3. Any other tips and stuff I may not know of? \n\nI\u2019d love to talk to some people that have gotten in for guitar as to what they played and what the audition was like if that was possible.\nThanks in advance!!",

They had me read a very simple melody (half notes and quarters) then \u201ccomp\u201d some jazz chords that were written as they would be in a jazz chart, and if im remembering correctly I think it was just major 7s, minor 7s, a 7#9, 9s and maybe a 13 or something a little more weird. Nothing too complex though. \nHope this helps, and if you have any more questions feel free to hit me up",

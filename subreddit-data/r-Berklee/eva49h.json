    "postText": "I was wondering why some people got notified about acceptance in mid December, and why some still wait until the end of January.\n\nI understand Early vs Regular decisions, but I\u2019m confused about the December acceptances. Is it necessarily bad for people who didn\u2019t get notified that early or is it a different wacky system?",

In an exchange with my admissions officer prior to the decision, he mentioned that \u201cearly action consideration was likely.\u201d  The Berklee website lists early action decisions as happening ON January 31st, so I was curious too.  I know people that received acceptances in December after being offered scholarships during camps at Berklee, but that was not the case for me.",

I was curious cause for other colleges (in Michigan for example; MSU and U of M) have rolling admissions and deferrals. Don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because Berklee is music based as to the others not being music based.",

    "postText": "So berklee is one of my top choices for post secondary in a couple years. I understand the expenses but I have backup plans for university and will only be attending if I receive a large scholarship (don\u2019t want to have 6 figure debt after!). My main question is - what is your opinion on the quality of the networking and connections you can make there? My career pathway depends on these connections as a way into the industry, and since I\u2019m really good at building relationships, I think that this is a plausible way to get myself a job in the industry. Thoughts?",

            "comment": "Depends on your age. Most of the people coming to Berklee are in their late teens, very early 20s. If you\u2019re in that range, then networking will be a breeze. And definitely worth it. I\u2019m an older non traditional student. It\u2019s been incredibly hard for me to network (one of the main reasons I came here as well), due to the age difference and the fact that I don\u2019t live on/really close to campus. I have made lots of connections with the professors and staff though, since they are about my age, and it\u2019s already helping. Also, the alumni network, the career center, and other resources are great to have as well. The career center can even approach companies for you to try to get you in the door.",

            "comment": "No. I made more friends at MIT and Harvard than Berklee and I didn\u2019t even go to those schools across the river. At least in the early 2000s the average Berklee student was super flakey, dropped out after 6 months and weren\u2019t actually that interesting folk to hang out with. Hate to say it but they generally fit the stoner stereotypes hard. The networking was not worth it IMO.",

            "comment": "I\u2019ve seen some friends end up pretty successful after Berklee based on the connections they have, but I think it was mostly because they were incredibly driven. Things didn\u2019t fall in their lap just because they were at Berklee, they busted their asses and created the opportunities themselves, then got offers for things later. I think you also get out what you put in - if you make an effort to connect with new people, do favors for them and have them return the favors, learn from anyone and everyone, then your payout for the work is opportunities and connections.\n\nBut this is coming from someone who went for music therapy, so take my advice with a grain of salt. I have some friends working successfully in music business in Nashville, and some friends who continue to bartend and whine about not playing music anymore in Nashville. I have some friends who went to LA and are successful top liners and songwriters, and some friends who work for Apple. It\u2019s all about the work you do.",

If you can balance it with classes, you can make bank there working while in school, but it\u2019s kind of a black hole. I worked there for a summer and got out before I got sucked in. I knew a lot of people there who were Berklee grads that simply couldn\u2019t leave because the money was too good. Some of them went to LA to try and work in music and continue to sell phones because they haven\u2019t gotten jobs in music. \n\nFor the record, Apple is actually a great place to work, but unfortunately it seems like they ended up staying there because they didn\u2019t \u201cmake it\u201d.",

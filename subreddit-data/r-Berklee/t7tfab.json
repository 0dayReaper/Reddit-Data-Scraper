Applications for those periods are typically about 9 months out. All students are automatically considered for scholarship upon audition, but after their first year on campus, more scholarship opportunities open up. American students are also given the opportunity to get federal aid.",

I don't know much about how American education system works, so I couldnt articulate it properly.\n\nSo you're saying that I can either apply to summer, spring or fall semester (is this applicable for all program?). I thought that we can apply only on April.",

There\u2019s three application periods, so that\u2019s just wrong. Each has its own separate deadlines, you should be able to find them on the Berklee website. For example, I applied to enter in Fall 2020, so my application was due by the end of January 2020. If I wanted an early response (and I did), my deadline was the beginning of November 2019.",

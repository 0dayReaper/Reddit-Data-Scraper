    "postText": "Hey guys! So I had my audition today and I\u2019m just looking for a little insight and feedback about my audition. To make a long story short I nailed my prepared piece and the improvisation, they even said I have a very nice passionate bluesy sound/style. When he changed keys I was able to adapt to the changes pretty well. The one guy loved that I played Lenny by Stevie Ray Vaughan. They even complimented me on Eddie Hazel (guitarist for Funkadelic) being one of my influences, they said they\u2019d never heard a guitar player mention his name before. The only concern I have is my call and response and sight reading. I was unable to play back the melodies 100% that he played on piano but was able to sing them perfectly when he asked me to do that instead. The sight reading all I could do was identify the notes on the staff and play some of them on the guitar. Was also able to play the chords that were there but unable to play it in time correctly. What\u2019s bothering me is the vibe I got from them, even though they expressed positive feedback it seemed like the negative feedback was very negative and outweighed the stuff I did well, almost like my positive attributes/skills were inferior. Am I just being paranoid or is this just the way you\u2019re supposed to feel after this kind of thing? This is my first audition to any music school and I have little live experience as a guitarist however I expressed to them that I\u2019m very willing and eager to prosper and grow as musician. Would you guys say I have a shot? I know the school is very selective, would appreciate any feedback as this is sort of eating me up. Thanks!",

They kind of seemed to rush me in everything too, however they did say they were  backed up with auditions. They had a solid state fender for the amp and I play a super reverb so that was also a little bit of an issue but was able to play my piece well. Thanks for the reply!",

I\u2019ve heard they want to see a player that has high potential to learn and grow and do not expect complete perfection.",

If I were you, I\u2019d prepare to improv over a basic 12 bar blues. Learning all the major and minor scales to the best of your ability are crucial. The improv, to my understanding, is fairly important to the audition, because it shows how you communicate with other musicians in real time. Rhythm playback and melody playback should be easy for you though. I\u2019m mostly working by ear too, and it went past pretty smoothly. If you play a piece that you arranged by ear, I\u2019d preface the piece with that. It\u2019s an impressive thing to be able to say.",

It should also be a piece that you feel really comfortable playing. I picked a piece from a video game that I had arranged in a fairly rudimentary way 2 and a half years ago and had been revising little by little since. It was a piece I knew inside and out, could practically play with my eyes closed, and where I felt like I could be myself and still find ways to make each performance unique. Playing with timing and dynamics can be really fun if it\u2019s your style. I\u2019d experiment with all sorts of things until you settle on something that satisfies all these kinda vague qualifiers.",

I wonder if they\u2019d be willing to look past that and see my abilities for what they are",

There's a ton of classically trained people entering Berklee (especially on piano) who can't improvise at all when they enter. \n\nThey aren't looking for you to be a fully formed professional musician upon entering; just a person who has the potential of becoming one. \n\nOn the flipside, there's a ton of drummers who enter who barely know what a chord is, and certainly can't read anything with notes, let alone spell out a G major scale.",

But if you take them as just another thing to learn... a pattern, a logic, a set of rules, a trick... you'll be fine. Your first three Harmony classes are going to center around scales and modes. If you don't succeed at those classes, you'll not be able to progress at Berklee. \n\nInstead of saying you can't, find another way to learn them. There's literally thousands of YouTube videos, books, methods, etc. Find your learning style. \n\nLook up the Circle of Fifths along with the scales. There's a consistent logic to all of it; and it's oddly really not that bad. Make flashcards, drill through them. You've got this.",

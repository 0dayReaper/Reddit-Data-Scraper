    "postText": "Hi guys.\nSo the due date for the fall semester of 2021 is tomorrow January 15th, and my current school only sent my transcripts yesterday, so I have no time to send it to SpanTran (I'm an international student) and my IELTS centre are yet to send my results to the university. Am I in trouble? My audition is already scheduled and I have already payed for my application, also the admission office is not picking up calls nor emails, and the officer that was assigned to me isn't picking up either.\n\nAm I in trouble? What can I do?",

You can however defer this if you feel that you are good enough to skip out on the testing, but they will require your high school or your most current academic scores to do so.",

I finished my audition today and I just receive my zoom link 6 hrs before the audition cuz there's some error in the email and they are quite slow in replying email (usually it takes 3-4days but they will prob read it faster if ur title include \"urgent\"). Just email them abt your situation and probably scan a copy of your ielts result (cuz my organisation have send my ielts score but they still hvnt receive so they called me to scan a copy of it)\nDon't be panic it will be fine\u2764\ufe0f",

I don't think this is good enough for a music school but I thought to check on here since I have no clue what the exact level they expect in auditions is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know if I'm in over my head :)",

Technique-wise I think that it is beyond the average auditionee. However, a classically trained student typically will have other challenges during the audition, mostly improv and sight reading charts. Happy to talk further if you're interested.

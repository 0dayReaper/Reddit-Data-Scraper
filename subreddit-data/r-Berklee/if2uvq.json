    "postText": "Hi all.  I'm a pharmacist with a doctorate in pharmacy, and I'm looking to take 1-2 online classes a semester just to expand my learning and get some experience under my belt for especially gaming/electronic composition.  This is simply a hobby I have a high interest in and not a career path, but something I'd like to continue to develop into the future, potentially starting out here with some classes and eventually building to  at least getting onto some indie projects though what I learn and develop here.\n\nDo you guys have any recommendations for this?  I have a phone meeting with an advisor on Monday morning.  I've looked at the catalogue and picked out a few classes I'm interested in, but wanted to get some opinions, or if you thought I had better options doing it a different way.",

Gina Zdanowicz wrote and teaches the course, and she's been great the whole time.  You'll need to be able to work in a standard DAW, a two track editor, the Unity Game Engine, and FMOD Audio middleware.  There's a lot of detail oriented work that does take some time, but so far I think it is very rewarding.",

By that I mean, when you say I need to be able to work in those, do you mean prior to class be capable in them, or just have the means to work in them?\nThat sounds awesome though, I'm glad it's been a rewarding experience! I love being detail oriented.",

Audacity is fine as a two track editor, but I've been using RX. You'll learn how to work in Unity and FMOD as part of the class. I should add that I've had to use a video editor as well, but all of that has been very basic- just marrying up your created audio with game footage.  If your DAW supports that, you won't need the video editor",

By RX do you mean like RX7, and is that the one you'd recommend getting familiar with before classes ie it's worked well for you?\nSpring semester is what I'm looking at or a class so I've got sometime to mess with different engines.",

I use it a lot for cleaning up clicks, pops, and other mouth sounds for voice over work. It also can come in handy for getting rid of things like 50/60Hz hum when people send me files that have that.  I've managed to minimize wind noise with it too (not entirely remove it).  In more extreme use cases, I've been able to do things like remove a dog bark, a phone ringing, or a plane flying over- but that's not often.  \n\nAll that aside, you'd be able to do everything you need to for that class just fine with Audacity.",

                    "comment": "Thank you so much for the reply.  Your points make sense, and I will take them to heart.  As a big fan of music and especially game music, I will admit I had not thought of your point about hobbyist professionals pushing other full time professionals out due to competition of pay when one is more \"stable\" financially and the other isn't.  That's a great point, and I appreciate you bringing it up.  I can understand why that's a touchy subject.\n\nI also appreciate your point about the small distinction between composition and game composition, which I agree with.  Music is music, and while game music is unique in its own way, every medium feeds into each other; different styles, atmospheres, instruments, genres all feed into what could be considered \"video game music\" because it is so diverse, and because music itself is so self-feeding and evolving within itself.  It's all tied together.\n\nTo your other points, I've been playing music and writing music for a bit and have a stable grasp on composition and reading music; I have Ableton Lite and a MIDI Keyboard now and have been messing with them, and simply learning from YouTube and experience is my plan for right now.  Overtime, after speaking with an advisor today and potentially for the call semester, I'm looking at the Composing and Producing Electronic Music Certificate.  That is what my advisor and I discussed, and what I feel to be kind of the level that I was, at least starting out, obviously in addition to self learning.\n\nThank you so much for the detailed and honest reply, I appreciate you.",

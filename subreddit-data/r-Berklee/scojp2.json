While I appreciate what I learned there, I have some (many?) regrets as this has massively delayed much of my \"adulthood\" because I was always scrambling to pay student loans in a high cost of living city.\n\nAdvice is either find some scholarships in the country where you are a citizen that would apply to Berklee, or be prepared for a lifetime of debt. Alternately, don't go. There are other good, far cheaper, place to learn music.",

Secondly, if you are still new to the college journey then I'd say go to community college for an associates then go to Berklee. I would have tried out for songwriting if I didn't see all of the other music options the industry has to offer.",

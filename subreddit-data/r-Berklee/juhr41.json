    "postText": "Hello! I had my audition earlier today and I figured I\u2019d share my experience. \nY\u2019all it\u2019s so chill, DONT stress! I auditioned with voice however I couldn\u2019t imagine this process being much different for different instruments. You join the big group zoom call and when it\u2019s your turn you will be sent an invite to a private breakout room for your audition. I had two evaluators. They asked me a couple questions just to get a basic idea of what kind of music I like/ my style and then I started my piece. BIG THING- if you are using a track to accompany yourself, play it off of the same computer you are running the zoom off of. You can share your audio which you will also need to do for your improve section. I also did some call and response with rhythm and pitches as well as sight reading. After that, you go back to the main lobby where you will be sent another breakout link for your interview. The interview is really laid back, the guy I talked to just awesome and so supportive. If going to this school is something you really want and something you are meant to do, these questions should be pretty easy to answer. Check out the sample questions online, he didn\u2019t ask me about anything that wasn\u2019t mentioned there. \nLet me know if you have any questions! I\u2019d love to help ease any worries you may have.",

If you\u2019re singing it, you could use scat or just neutral syllables, whatever you\u2019d like.\nDon\u2019t worry too much about it, just listen and play along with the samples they provided and you\u2019ll be just fine. I don\u2019t have much improv experience but those practice tracks really helped! My improv went much better than I anticipated because of them.\nRemember also that they aren\u2019t expecting perfection, they are just trying to see if you have the potential to learn and thrive in their school. Hope this helped!!",

Some in major, some in minor, but nothing too crazy. You perform it right when you see it for the first time (it is sight reading after all) but it isn\u2019t that bad. (If you\u2019re a vocalist...)He plays the starting pitch as well as some chords in the key to get it in your ear. I sang on a neutral syllable but I\u2019m sure solfege is chill if that\u2019s what you prefer.",

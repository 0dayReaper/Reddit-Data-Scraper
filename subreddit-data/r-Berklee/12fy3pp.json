    "postText": "Hello, my name is Tristia Thompson (she/her). I am a songwriting major, film scoring minor. I have a horror movie/show hyperfixation, and I love ranting about them/discussing them/watching them with other people. My favorite are the Scream movies, Saw movies, IT movies, and pretty much anything Stephen King. Another one of my hyperfixations is sitcoms, I love talking about and watching them with other people.\u00a0 I love Friends, The Office, That 70\u2019s Show, The Big Bang Theory, and The Simpsons. I also love making/listening to bedroom pop, and indie pop and rock. My favorite artists are Conan Gray, YUNGBLUD, The 1975, Taylor Swift, Harry Styles, Melanie Martinez, Halsey, Hozier, and Marina And The Diamonds. I also love writing horror/romance fiction. I also find true crime and criminal psychology interesting. Either way, yeah, I\u2019m just looking for some more peeps with some shared interests, my instagram is tristia.marie and my discord is this so hit me up if u wanna chat!",

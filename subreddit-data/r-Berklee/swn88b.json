    "postText": "Hello berklee community,\n\nI had a quick question regarding whether or not my application/audition was considered \u201cearly decision\u201d. So I submitted my application in November of 2021, before the end of the \u201cearly decision\u201d date, because I wanted to make sure and get any extra scholarships or benefits from applying early as possible. However, my audition was not scheduled until January 29th (had been scheduled for Jan. 22nd because that was the next time the auditions were gonna be held in Dallas, TX, area, but they changed my audition to online and a week later cuz of rising covid cases). Will my audition still be considered under the \u201cearly decision\u201d, or will I not receive as many benefits or scholarships because the actual audition itself was so late?\n\nThanks, and shoutout to any drummers applying \ud83e\udd2a\u261d\ufe0f",

So I know my friend who\u2019s applying had a very similar experience, and his was pushed back to regular decision after his audition was moved to around late Jan. as well. As regards to the scholarships/benefits, I\u2019m not exactly sure how that works depending on when you applied/auditioned, but I don\u2019t really think it should affect your scholarship amount! (But again I really have no idea for sure lol). I hope this helps!",

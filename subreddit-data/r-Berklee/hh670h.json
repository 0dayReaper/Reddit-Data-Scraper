Then, they scheduled a two hour class right before my ensemble, which I had to fix again because I couldn't physically be there and ready that fast. (How was I to change buildings, put together two instruments, warm-up, tune, and be ready to record in just ten minutes?) Next, I had a horrible theory professor who told me, \"If you don't know that by now it's too late for you\" (I already have a music degree too). I just dropped the class at that point, because it wasn't worth jumping through all the hoops again. \n\nIt was way better after the first semester. Don't listen to the receptionists in advising if they tell you can't see an advisor- email the head of advising and go during drop-in hours! I could have saved a lot of grief if I had done that sooner. \n\nMaybe you will have an easier time. I certainly hope you do. Let me know if you need help navigating anything. It's easier if you know what you're doing.",

I did a year at community college, and registered for classes completely by myself online. I spoke with an advisor who recommended which courses to take, but I planned my own schedule, and could change it around as I wished up until the deadline. At Berklee, if you make an appointment with an advisor, then can you plan your schedule? It\u2019s hard for me to believe you can\u2019t plan your own schedule, especially after my experience at community college with it being so easy and flexible.",

The system for transfer students is really bad. I came with two degrees actually, one music and one in humanities and I STILL had to deal with this nonsense. \n\nIt was very jarring since I had been choosing my own classes for years.\n\nIt\u2019s a stupid system. A lot of the orientation events were useless to me too. There wasn\u2019t enough for transfer students and there wasn\u2019t enough for ADULTS. I was almost 25 (and married!) and being treated like I was 18, fresh out of high school. I used to teach high schoolers. It was incredibly frustrating and there\u2019s not really any way out of it. \n\nI ended up talking to the dean of student success and I hope that I can work to make Berklee better for transfer students. There\u2019s a lot of us, so this really isn\u2019t acceptable.",

Sounds like it\u2019s going to be crazy to get used to the way things are done there at first. I really appreciate all the info, it\u2019s better to know now how things work, then start freaking out when I get there, lol. Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions! And I think it\u2019s awesome that you started talking with the dean of success. Maybe a better system will be worked out in the future.",

My first semester, I had a schedule that gave me 9am classes everyday, and then very longs breaks until I had an 8pm class almost every night. I tried to see if I could switch up my schedule to make my late classes earlier, because I didn't like that my whole day felt like it was taken hostage, but they won't do it just because its an inconvenient time. After your first semester, it's a lot easier.",

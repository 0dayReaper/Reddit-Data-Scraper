I also forgot to add that in the sight reading they will mostly likely ask you to sight read chord changes in a lead sheet as well.  I was part of a jazz band so I had training reading chord changes.  For the sight reading the piece, you should probably find a book that teaches sight reading, I saw a handful of those online.  I didn't use any of those books, I just bought the \"Accelerated Piano Adventures for the Older Beginner\" Level 1 and 2 by Nancy Faber and sight read through both books, but I did it for fun rather for the audition.",

I'm from a classical background so I'm not used to playing a chord that's not notated. I can play simple chords from a sheet that I've had a look at before.\n\nIf it's similar to the one's from the link, what would be your advice?\n\nFor the improvisation part, do you get to choose the key?\n\nThere are different styles on that practice section page. Do you get to choose one? The jazz ballet was the one that had the most defined chords out of the ones I checked out. The others felt too busy. The harmonic rhythm was too much. \n\nWhat would be your advice for improvising? Learning/adapting/practicing. \n\nThanks!",

They won't show you the music sheet that is from the link.  The one I read isn't even on the link.  You might be expected to read chords with 7th.  For advice, you should play the chord changes from the link with the mp3 provided and/or play chord changes to your favorite pop song.  Why you should play along with the songs/mp3 is because you might be asked to play in time, as well as voice lead the chords.\n\nFor improvisation, you can choose what key you want to improv on.  You can't choose what style you improv because your only improvising over the Blues Progressions.  That being said, you might be asked if you want to do a jazz improv or a pop improv, I was asked this.  For advice, you should learn the blues scales for jazz improv (and pentatonic for pop).  Practice using the scale in the Blues Progressions from the link.",

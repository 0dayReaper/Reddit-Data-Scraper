I haven't been officially accepted yet but I auditioned a coupled weeks ago and it went really well so I'm just figuring out if I can bring it so I can figure out what I'm gonna do with all the stuff I can't bring. Idk if anyone will look at this post but if I'd appreciate it if y'all have any insight into this rather trivial issue !\n\ntl;dr can i use a windows desktop in my dorm",

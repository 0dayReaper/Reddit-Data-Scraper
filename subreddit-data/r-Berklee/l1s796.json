    "postText": "Hi! I'm a drummer and I would like to go to Berklee. I'm studying Business but I've been playing drums since I was 5, so music has a special place in my heart. I recently found out that music is actually the path and career I wanna pursue, so I was wondering if any of you can give me tips for the interview (like questions or topics they'll ask), if I can play a song with personal fillings and stuff (or if it has to be exactly like the original), and especially: how is the improv and sight playing part? \n\nHope it's not too much haha, but would appreciate any advice you have &lt;33",

So basically feel free to add your own personality to the performance and music and in fact that\u2019ll probably go a long way with the judges.",

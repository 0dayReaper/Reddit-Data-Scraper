Time and feel are super important as well make sure you know how to construct a walking line, and have it feel good. I suggest buying a real book and learning some heads as well as soloing over the changes. listen and transcribe famous solos for ideas and language. Theory and ear training also go a long way make sure you know the basics. You will be asked to play a prepared piece make sure it's something you like in a style you are interested in playing that is origional. Don't go in and play Dean Town they have heard it 1000000 times. Having music that you have written and they can look at says a lot too. Overall practice and be comfortable with your instrument. Hope to see you in the bass department and good luck",

My son has been playing bass for years but decided to audition on piano (self taught) - he went in pretty blind, not knowing much more than was on the Berklee website about auditions. He got in with a scholarship (albeit on the smaller side), so we figured that was due to his musicality, interview, high gpa, and theory background. Now I really wish he had auditioned on bass! If a student decides to switch their principal instrument, do they have an opportunity to be considered for a higher scholarship amount?",

Changing your principal instrument is a bit of a taboo at berklee (though it really ought not to be), so I don't know many people who've done it. Furthermore, I haven't really talked about scholarships with those people.",

Get involved with music outside of just you playing and talk about that in the interview portion! Goodluck!",

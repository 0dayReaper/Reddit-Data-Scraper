    "postText": "I'm a 21 year old sophomore in her fourth semester at Berklee. From the beginning it was my dreaming school. I worked my butt off during my gap year to be able to ace my audition. Now it just doesn't feel fun anymore. I have some good friends here and some amazing professors too. However, I just feel quite demoralized. I feel like I work so hard for nothing. Yesterday I had my first day of classes, and I hated it. I felt the same way about my songwriting class today. I had such high hopes for the songwriting major, but most of the classes have been so underwhelming. I feel like I'm starting to lose my passion and connection to something I really loved. I have my mental health struggles, but a part of me wonders if some of this is unique to Berklee. Has anyone ever felt like this? What did you do?",

I found myself pushing as much away as I was taking in as I felt when we went there 75% of the players sounded the same. My punk rock attitude pushed through, but I have to admit I regret not diving into the straight ahead playing they so deeply offered more.",

There\u2019s tons of opportunities for this kind of culture shock to manifest \u2014 Boston can be weird, half of the students are competing with other half for attention, with no sort of common goal, and in 15 different languages\u2014it\u2019s very hard to navigate, so uber-congrats on making it this far. Keep going. \n\nThe best way to fight it is to dive headfirst into the multicultural aspects of Berklee. Go see the Indian Ensemble, or the Boston Symphony Orchestra (it\u2019s free for students!). You can always find something to learn and get excited about. \n\nAnd about your professors, if you\u2019re not clicking with them, you may still have time to shuffle your schedule around. Talk to the registrar. Talk to Scarlet Keys and Beth Denisch (composition), if you don\u2019t already. They were both always really involved in making sure students got what we needed out of the experience.",

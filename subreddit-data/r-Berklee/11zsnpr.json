I am now an undergrad on campus in Boston. Majority of my classes are transferrable and I may be able to take off 2-3 semesters when I start my semester in May. If you want to do this too, you\u2019d have to consult with your advisor first. Let me know if you have any questions. I\u2019d be happy to help :)",

I did my undergrad at the Boston campus like 10 years ago, which was extremely different, but I'd imagine the various online programs are all pretty similar. The grad program I'm in is pretty quick (1 year) and there is a very specific set of classes with no electives.",

If you like doing that then it shouldn't be too much of an issue. It's definitely been challenging for me getting two essays done every week. I agree with you that doing 3 courses plus working a part-time job is exhausting. That's what I've been doing this semester.",

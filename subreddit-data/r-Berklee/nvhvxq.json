But a quick note about attending a community college for a year: so many students say it was worth it! You can take the required liberal arts courses from a community college at a fraction of the cost, then transfer to Berklee with those out of the way.  Then you can just focus on music and may be able to graduate faster (in like 3 years?), which means less loans to pay off later.",

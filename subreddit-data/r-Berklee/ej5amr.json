    "postText": "I've been taking classes thru Berklee Online for the past year and am transferring to main campus. I have all my GE credits transferred in from Ohio State.\n\nBerklee Online is great but I am missing the full immersive environment, working and collaborating with others. Their studios and talent across the board in all majors are top notch. \n\nDid anyone do anything similar to this? I already have a degree from OSU so I don't really care about the college experience, I am going use 100% of my time to work on music and production. I am trying to figure out where to live to maximize money and time. \n\nAppreciate the feedback and looking forward to hearing others' stories if they had a similar path!",

            "comment": "Going to the Boston campus will probably help set off your career. The environment is full of talented musicians that want to collab with as many people as possible and build up those relationships for the future. Though it is very expensive, the connections you make with other musicians there is priceless.\n\nIf housing in Boston is too expensive, the towns west of Boston are a great option as long as they are close to the Green Line because there\u2019s a Green Line stop right near the campus and so commuting to get there might be cheaper than living so close by.",

Epstein told us a story about a dude started from a causal online course then ended up going to the main campus then eventually become a teacher at berklee Boston campus. \n\nSo I guess it\u2019s totally doable. But again Idk exactly how. \nMaybe ask admission office? Not online admission but Boston campus admission.",

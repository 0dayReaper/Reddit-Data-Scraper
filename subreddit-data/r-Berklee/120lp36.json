I\u2019ve noticed that there\u2019s a lot a listings from June Homes and SplitSpot which seem incredibly cheap compared to some other listings. However I did some digging and saw that it doesn\u2019t seem all that great to rent with them. Has anybody rented from them and how was that experience like?",

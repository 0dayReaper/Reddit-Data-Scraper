    "postText": "I've read the course module and I really want to do this as my major but there are special requirements I need to fulfil. I'm nowhere as good at tech as I want to be in terms of the stuff I've produced up to now. It's mediocre at best. \n\nWhat do you think I could do to be able to declare? Any courses or even youtubers I could follow? Any recommendations at all? Maybe a sample of how good my work should be when I submit it? What skills should I already have before declaring?\n\nDo you have any idea what they want? It's such a mysterious major to me and all my friends are in more writing oriented majors. :') Any help is welcome!",

            "comment": "Hi! Recent graduate of EPD and MPE here (2020). There's a lot you can learn in EPD on top of producing electronic music, there has been an increase lately for video game/movie sound design, live performance (especially with the new EDI primary instrument), and audio/visual combination for performances and music showcases. So having an idea of what you want to get out of EPD is going to help you a lot with your application during the essay and interview portion which the faculty mainly focus on for the application, they also will take your GPA into account. EPD mainly wants to find students that are passionate about improving and have shown that they are good students already at Berklee so I would lean into that since you say you aren't as good at tech as you want to be. As far as learning more on the tech side, watch some videos about using Ableton as it's the main DAW that EPD uses. If using Ableton to perform music interest you look up dolltr!ck on YouTube, they're an EPD grad, Ableton certified trainer, and great at performing. If you have any other questions I'd be glad to answer them! Good luck with your application!",

Is it short for Electronic Production &amp; Design?\n\nI can\u2019t believe they have electronic instruments as a primary instrument. It\u2019s strange, but smart on the business side as music is changing. I don\u2019t know how you can do all of the jazz and Latin requirements that were there when I went with that as your principal.",

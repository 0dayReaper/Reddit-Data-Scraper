    "postText": "I am considering doing a single class per semester while I am studying music at a local community college.  I can pay at least one lesson per semester but I was looking at the same courses and honestly , I don't see what the hype is, especially at 1200 dollars per course. The samples make it same like its more reading than it is teacher instruction. Almost like we watch a video of the teacher giving a brief overview and the rest is self study.  \n\n\nMaybe I am missing something here. Can anyone who has taken an online class shed some light?   \n\n\nHere is the link to the sample lessons for reference:  [https://online.berklee.edu/sample-a-lesson](https://online.berklee.edu/sample-a-lesson)   \n\n\nI am only interested in 4 classes from Berklee,   \n\n\n[Keyboard for electronic musicians](https://online.berklee.edu/courses/keyboard-for-the-electronic-musician)\n\n[Writing hit songs](https://online.berklee.edu/courses/songwriting-writing-hit-songs)\n\n[Arranging for songwriters](https://online.berklee.edu/courses/arranging-for-songwriters-instrumentation-and-production-in-songwriting)\n\n[Arranging the rhythm section](https://online.berklee.edu/courses/arranging-1-rhythm-section)  \n\n\nIf anyone has taken those, id appreciate some insight.   \n\n\nThank you!",

You can teach yourself everything at Berklee with Scribd and YouTube.\n\nThe reason why Berklee is so highly regarded is because the best of the best come to Berklee and work hard enough to become the next big pop star. Then, they refer their friends from Berklee to work in the industry with them. In addition, Berklee faculty will have access to incredible gigs, and they'll be willing to let you have the work, if you're good enough.  Berklee is all about connections. Having a degree from Berklee will get you nowhere, but having connections will.\n\nSo, I'd say that Berklee Online is not worth it, unless you're just doing it for the degree. It might even be worth it to spend a semester in Boston to make connections, and then finish your degree online to save money.",

Fact there\u2019s an old joke \u201cif you graduate from a Berklee you\u2019re doing it wrong (meaning, most people go there, make connections and get to work right away.) I graduated from Berklee online and it hasn\u2019t changed my life in any meaningful way. Of course I had no expectations. I attended because I had GI bill money remaining after getting my MS degree and wanted to use it for something fun. I had just enough left to attend and graduate from Berklee. I learned a good bit and really enjoyed it. I graduated from musicians institute back in the early 90\u2019s and can say I learned a lot more at Berklee. Having said that, I could have learned the same things via the internet and self study for free. If I didn\u2019t have the GI Bill to pay for it, I wouldn\u2019t have gone. In fact, when I graduated, someone from Berklee contacted me. Apparently if I took just two more classes I would get some certificate. But since my GI bill was used up, it would be out of pocket. Nah I\u2019m good.",

            "comment": "If you're not already at Berklee, and talking about your main Berklee audition - the audition looks the same for everyone regardless of major. You don't even generally declare your major until you've been there some time (a year? I can't recall). MP&amp;E is only applied for later, and has a separate application process. I don't recall if that process involves an instrument audition, but if I recall it's largely based on your grades, overall aptitude and an interview.\n\nYou can't apply to Berklee and MP&amp;E at the same time.\n\n-----\n\nNow for the part that's more opinion-based:\n\nAs for auditions at Berklee - with some exception of top 1% talent folks, I don't think you can aim to impress them. You aren't applying to be the most-creative person in a band, you're applying to college.\n\nWhat are they looking for? Someone who understands their instrument, shows aptitude for growth/learning, and who is just really solid overall. Playing faster, fancier and more esoteric pieces - if not done _absolutely perfectly_ will probably do more harm than good. \n\nPick something that you know incredibly well (or learn something incredibly well) that demonstrates that you have a strong command of your instrument. I'd rather hear someone do a killer job on Autumn Leaves than some shred metal piece that's got 5000-notes but is done in a sub-par manner.\n\nI also understand that a lot (but not all) folks who are focused on the technical aspect might not feel as strong as someone who is purely performance focused. It's ok - just really show what you've got. If you haven't learned a solid audition piece, now is the time to do that.",

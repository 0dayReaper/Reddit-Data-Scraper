    "postText": "Hey I went to a school with very musical people and I remember them saying a good way of ensuring passing auditions was messaging professors before hand and trying to get in touch in one way or another I believe the ultimate goal was to schedule like a lesson and meet them and show you\u2019re dedicated. I found out that one of my dads former high school classmates is now a professor at berklee and don\u2019t really know how to approach that. So advice would be appreciated",

            "comment": "Never hurts to try. And I think it\u2019s good to establish a strong student/teacher bond with your professors and show them how much you care. If it doesn\u2019t help with the audition, it\u2019ll help with other things like making connections while you\u2019re at Berklee. If a professor finds you to be passionate and hard working, then they\u2019ll probably provide you  with good opportunities in the future. Also, I\u2019m not sure if the professor you contact actually auditions you, but it could happen.\n\nMy theory professor from the Aspire program at campus this summer auditioned me and I got in. Helped because he knew that I was really passionate about music and really paid attention in class.",

If they have time, they\u2019ll get back to you answering any questions you have. If you take online classes with Berklee, you could also get introduced to a lot of the professors through there because most of them work on campus in Boston. I do have one tip. Each major you take might have some liberal arts course requirements. I suggest you take those online with berklee so that you can be ahead of the game while you\u2019re in school and maybe even graduate a year early and save money. A credit course with Berklee is about $1,500. You can take that and finish in 12 weeks and fulfill your one or more of your core class requirements before you get in. All Berklee online liberal arts courses are transferable. I have about 36-40 something credits from Berklee online and I\u2019m starting campus in May. I\u2019ve taken the majority of the classes required for my major already and will most likely graduate sooner if everything works out.\n\nIf you have questions about this, let me know. I\u2019m also learning myself and would be happy to share the info i\u2019ve found so far.",

Requesting information, sending a brief snippet of what you\u2019ve got, and demonstrating genuine interest could have a positive impact on your application. \n\nRemember though, that professors generally don\u2019t directly interact with Admissions.",

    "postText": "Hi.\n\nIncoming fall student tryna not make dumb purchases here. I know we're supposed to have an external drive, but the website is fairly fluffy on what exactly is needed (I know it's subjective but still). Is 1tb okay? Should I get 2? Is it necessary to have SSD as opposed to a mechanical drive? \n\nAnyway help would be appreciated, or even just saying which one you have and if it worked out okay. \n\nCheers y'all.",

I recommend buying when you need it.\n\nBut if you want to, just get a 1 TB SSD (NOT HHD)\n\nAlso, try to test out of mtech if you already know logic even a little bit. It's pretty lame and you can skip to protools",

            "comment": "SSD\u2019s are faster, SAFER, and probably better and more useful in every way, especially if you do a lot of production. You could have your projects, sample libraries, or even kontakt sound libraries stored in there to use while producing. I personally have like 3-4 different 1TB ssd\u2019s. One for my samples, kontakt instruments/sounds, and 2 for backing up projects. One of the back up ssd\u2019 is a hard copy of the other one I use as back up. I have other bigger drives that are placed in different locations - one in my apartment, another in my parents house so I can have a back up if anything goes wrong.\n\nPersonally I would say it IS necessary to have many drives if you want to be organized and keep your stuff safe. \n\nONCE AGAIN, SSD\u2019s are safer than mechanical drives because there are no moving parts, therefore nothing can go wrong (but that\u2019s not always guaranteed either - just less chance of happening). \n\nI suggest buying a Samsung T7 or a Sandisk SSD.\nMake sure you get a discount or sale price and buy more than one for different stuff you need.\n\nAlso 1TB is a decent size. But calculate your bang for buck. It might come off cheaper if you buy 2tb and partition it.",

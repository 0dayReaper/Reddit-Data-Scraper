    "postText": "Hi guys! So I had an audition in early April, and still haven\u2019t gotten an admissions decision. When do you guys think I\u2019ll get one? And what are they looking for when they admit someone? I think I\u2019m a pretty good singer, but is that all they look at? \nThanks\ud83d\ude0b",

            "comment": "I had my audition on the 15th of April and one of the guys asked the same question. The host said we'll receive the decision on the 9th of May, but I'm trying not to get my hopes up too much because they're also reviewing the applicants that got Waitlisted earlier.  \n\nWhen they admit someone I think they look at us as a whole artist, not just how well we play/sing. That's why we also have the interview. I think the Audition is to see our current level of musicianship(the music skills they tested us in the audition), how prepared we are for Berklee(like the core music classes and ensembles) and how much potential we have to improve and succeed at Berklee. And the interview is mainly to see what we'll bring to Berklee, our goals and ambitions, and how Berklee will help us achieve those goals.  So that's why the Audition and Interview are equally important.  I don't think the transcripts play as much of a factor as the other two, but they still look at them. I think they become more important for when they consider someone for a full tuition scholarship rather than just normal admission.",

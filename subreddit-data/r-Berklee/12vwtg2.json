    "postText": "First of all, I would like to congratulate everyone who is joining Berklee for the fall 2023 intake! I have got an offer but due to some personal reasons, I am considering defering admission to Spring 2024. I am quite torn right now as I am not sure if there are any difference or any possible advantages of choosing one intake over the other. Is it better to go fall rather than spring? Looking for some input here, especially from current students and alumni!",

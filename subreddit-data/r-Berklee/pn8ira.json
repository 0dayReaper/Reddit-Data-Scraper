    "postText": "Hi r/Berklee!\n\nI'm currently a semester 1 student at Berklee, and I'm wondering about my major choices. I would like to be a game scorer in the future, and I'm not sure whether CWP or FS would be the most suitable one.\n\nFor CWP, I was told that this major doesn't give you a chance for in-depth study, but rather something like a quick view about both technology and arranging. And for FS, a friend told me that the courses are entirely about films, which \"I think\", do not help that much for game scoring (correct me if I'm wrong). \n\nSo, I am hoping that you can share some of your experiences or insights with me here to help deal with the problem. Thank you very much!",

I had some basics on Logic Pro X and also some experiences of arranging music, it may seems that CWP suit me better. But my concern is, scoring for games may require some knowledges of music as \"language to picture\", and it doesn't seems like CWP would teach about that. I think I will ask more people around about that. Thanks for your information again!",

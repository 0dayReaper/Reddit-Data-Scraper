I signed up in hopes of getting the good travel college experience all my friends boasted about on top of my Berklee education. I hope to meet and bond with a bunch of amazing people there as well as experience some of the things I\u2019ve discussed in Spanish classes I\u2019ve taken in years past. I don\u2019t know much about it other than that housing there appeared to be cheaper than housing in Boston which is a neat bonus. \n\nI hope I can find a cool rundown of the Valencia Berklee experience with all its pros and cons from a current student who went on the trip. That would be handy for going into this freshman year",

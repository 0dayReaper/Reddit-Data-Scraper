    "postText": "Hi! I'm a second year physics major at UCLA and earlier this year I decided that I want to pursue music as a singer/songwriter/producer and I applied to Berklee and got in!! I deferred my acceptance to May 2022 because I just got to the UCLA campus (as an international student) so I thought starting Berklee in Jan 2022 would be too soon since I hadn't really experience UCLA enough to make that decision. Now, however, I am in two minds about transferring. On one hand, I could apply to the Music History and Industry (MHI) program at UCLA, and on the other, I could go to Berklee as a professional music major. The Music Industry advisor at UCLA sent me an email in which she essentially said I should go to Berklee because UCLA's MHI program is more academic based and Berklee would be more experience based and so would be more catered to what I'm looking for. Does anyone have any advice? Should I just email Berklee and ask if I can start in Jan '22 instead of May '22?\n\nAny advice would help I am quite confused.",

Besides, being a physics major you\u2019ll get a degree that will actually be worth more than the paper it\u2019s printed on.",

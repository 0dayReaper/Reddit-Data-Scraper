            "comment": "They have amps in every lesson room/practice room that you reserve. When they work they\u2019re usually pretty good, pretty much all Fender tube amps. But they\u2019re getting up there in age and a lot of them don\u2019t work Ahahahah. There\u2019s always a solution though, you\u2019ll never go amp-less. I\u2019ve never heard of people bringing their own amp to lessons, maybe to ensembles but that\u2019s not really necessary unless you really want it there... no one\u2019s going to stop you.\n\nThat being said, if you have an amp that you love, I\u2019d say bring it. People might say not to waste the space in your dorm, but I brought my massive super reverb this year and made it work. It was my bedside table lol. You\u2019re gonna want it for gigs (if you\u2019re planning on gigging) or rehearsals, even though there will always be amps in rehearsal rooms it\u2019s nice to have your own. But this is all just if you have an amp you love/want to bring. If not you\u2019ll be just fine, but you can\u2019t rent/remove any amps from the school if you\u2019re planning on gigging. The school owns a guitar center right across from 160 and you can rent amps/other equipment from there if you need it!",

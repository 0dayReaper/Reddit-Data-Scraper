    "postText": "hi! im a 16 yr old drummer/bassist/guitarist from NJ, and i recently finished berklee's 5 week aspire program. (principle instrument being drumset)\n\ni have a lot of mixed feelings about the whole experience, and id rate it a warm 5/10 \n\nthe placement audition, which was the day after i arrived, was sick. i played everlong by foo fighters, which i decided to do last minute (originally gonna do good times bad times by led zep). everyone while waiting was cool, i met one of my favorite people ive ever met right before my audition. (gio if you're seeing this i miss ya buddy!!!) the auditioners (i think thats the right term?) were super cool, super chill, awesome guys. james murphy is probably the coolest faculty i met there. \n\nif you're in my shoes, with little to no music theory knowledge, you'll probably end up getting placed in the lowest theory and ear training classes. these classes go over the basics, and when i say basics i mean it. if you can read music, and by that i mean rhythm, you'll probably spend two or three classes sitting there bored out of your mind waiting for those that do not know how to read to catch up (no shade to them, just caught me by surprise). \n\nafter going over the basics, my ear training class was incredibly boring. we went over solfege basics and some singing every day. maybe to some it was exciting and interesting, but for me personally it was boring and i couldnt find a reason why solfege was so important. \n\ntheory class was fine, i gotta admit i slept through a couple of classes, all of them being at 9:00 AM. it's theory, and we went through a couple concepts pretty fast and i'm definitely gonna look through the packets i bought. (speaking of that, the packets were stupid expensive- maybe 25 per \"book\" which were just a bunch of sheets of paper, needed to buy a binder as well)\n\nmy favorite classes were my ensemble, pop rock styles lab, reading lab, and my private lesson. the audition put me with people that are around my skill level, and im very thankful we all meshed very well together. they were some of the coolest people i met. skip hadden was teaching my styles lab, and he is the sweetest guy, super chill, really into latino grooves and stuff which was SO COOL to experience, coming from a hispanic person. my reading lab was taught by larry finn, and he was super cool. although i feel i was placed in a way lower reading lab than i should have been, everyone in the class was super cool, larry was a super nice guy. my private lesson was taught by james murphy- he is the single coolest faculty i met. we mostly jammed over some loops, but he gave me some valuable information and things to work on, such as his glue method.\n\nif you plan on going to berklee's 5 week and will be under 18 by the time you get there, be prepared to possibly have the worst roommates you will ever have. you get placed with people randomly in the age range of 15-17, without being able to meet them beforehand. being in a cramped room with 2 other teenagers, one of them being a semi normal person and the other being an absolute slob, someone who didnt consider the feelings or comfort of others that they had to share a room with for 5 weeks. finding my toothbrush on the side of the sink wet, finding my towel wet when i have yet to use it, having to walk through trash and dirty clothes and more was not the experience i was looking forward too. if you see this, whether it be through a friend or you stumble upon this yoursel, fuck you noah. i pray that i'll never have to see you again!\n\nanyways, when you go there you get what you put in, so give it all ya got and dont be afraid to talk to the office or an RA or something if you've got shitty roommates.\n\nlove almost everybody that i met there, and i miss you all :) \n\npeace and love \u270c\ufe0f",

            "comment": "I agree with you, but I\u2019d say It wasn\u2019t completely bad, but probably could\u2019ve been planned better. I was doing EDI and we didn\u2019t learn anything at all in theory (I was in level 1) and they expect us to transcribe a song we produced by the end of class - no one ever came to class so it was probably the reason why. Like when I say there were no lessons, I mean there were NONE. I never missed a class hoping that one of those days I\u2019d learn something. \n\nMusicianship was pretty decent for me as I had a really good teacher who really tried his best to teach as much as he could. I truly am grateful for his work ethic and how he managed to teach so much in such little time and not just practice on our final project song.\n\nEnsemble for EDI was awful. The students were pretty talented, but not everyone knew Ableton which was the DAW of choice so everyone had to learn it within the short time we had. No one ever had time to practice either so it was truly a bad experience in that area (no one really cared). I think that\u2019s mostly the students fault, but perhaps it could\u2019ve been better if the teachers had a better structured lesson plan for the private lessons, etc. Again, this is EDI and it\u2019s a new thing so I\u2019m not bothered by it. \n\nAll in all, this program was decent and I would honestly give it a 7.5/10 because of the connections I made with the faculty and students. I truly miss it and I think Berklee as a university is a fantastic and well worth it for those who really plan on making music their life/career in the future. Lots of good can come out of that school.",

            "comment": "I had Skip for a drum-style elective last semester, he\u2019s the man! Binders for the textbooks are unnecessary and the price is honestly really cheap. College textbooks go for obscene amounts of money, so Berklee making theirs so accesible is a blessing. Skipping classes is something that should be avoided, as material flies by quickly and it\u2019s easy to fall behind. Overall, it sounds like you got an abbreviated version of a pretty standard 1st semester at Berklee. I think you\u2019re overstating how mid some of the aspects are. It\u2019s school, school is gonna be a bit boring or tedious sometimes.",

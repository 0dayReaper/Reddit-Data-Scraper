    "postText": "hi, i just got my acceptance letter from berklee, but i didn\u2019t get any scholarship. my audition was pretty bad to my standards because i only decided to audition a day before I actually had to. i feel like if i had prepared i would\u2019ve gotten at least some money. i\u2019m supposed to go in september but i, of course, don\u2019t have the crazy amount that tuition goes for. I already have 24+ credits in music &amp; music education from miami dade college so i\u2019m not paying for the whole 4 years but it\u2019s still a lot of money and my mom is not rich. i\u2019m from argentina and my mom single-handedly pays for most of my expenses, so it\u2019s gonna be tough anyway. I was wondering if you recommended any scholarships/sites in particular, or if i should do the audition again or what. pls help. \nps: i\u2019m going to major in producing &amp; songwriting",

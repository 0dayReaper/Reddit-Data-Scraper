    "postText": "I've just enrolled in Berklee Online and wanted to hear people's opinions on the best professors to do private lessons with.  I'm most interested in jazz, but I'm more concerned with improving my weaknesses and becoming more fluent on my instrument then focussing on any singular sytle.\n\nThe online program doesn't have as many options as campus, but there are 28 different professors who are listed as doing online lessons.  The full list is here if anyone wants to check it out:  \n[https://online.berklee.edu/private-lesson-schedules/guitar](https://online.berklee.edu/private-lesson-schedules/guitar)",

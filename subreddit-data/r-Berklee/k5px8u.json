    "postText": "So I\u2019ve been looking into some schools that offer an online music business program. This is the school I\u2019m most interested in, but I\u2019m a little confused about the application process. I can\u2019t seem to figure out if I\u2019ll have to do a live audition or not. I talked to someone from the school on the phone the other night, and they said for the music business online I don\u2019t have to do a \u201cdemonstration of musicianship\u201d. Is that an audition, or is that something else??? Everything I\u2019ve read on their website makes it seem like every program requires the audition. Could someone please answer this for me? I\u2019m very confused. \ud83d\ude02 Thanks!",

There\u2019s also placement based ensembles everyone gets put in, and additional audition based ensembles you can audition for the first day of five-week. You also take a 30 min private lesson every week, and you take 1 mandatory elective and an extra elective.\n\nThe final exam for theory like the end of the last week at five week, I think each teacher decides what time we take it.",

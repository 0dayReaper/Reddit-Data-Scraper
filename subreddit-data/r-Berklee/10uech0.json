    "postText": "I just got accepted to Berklee with a small partial scholarship and I want to get a clearer picture of what courses I need to take and how much it will cost. I'm currently studying at a Berklee Global Partner so I will be transferring in almost the max 60 credit and completed my 3rd and 4th year of the degree there. \n\nDoes anyone have any experience transferring i credits? Will I still need to pay full tuition each semester or will my transfer credits lower the cost per semester?",

Unless you are only attending part time, in which case you pay per credit, a regular full load of classes is always the same tuition rate regardless of how many credits you have transferred in.",

            "comment": "velaurciraptorr is right. You'll be paying for fewer semesters needed to finish your degree. \n\nPlease speak to/email the registrar's office. You can present them with a transcript, and ask them what other classes you need to take in order to finish your degree, assuming you declare a particular major. It's really hard to say for certain without consulting the registrar's office. And I wouldn't want to give you incorrect information. Good luck!",

Some curriculums are really strict with prerequisite and corequisite classes to the point where no matter what it will take 4 years. Transfer credits can certainly knock out your liberal arts requirement though allowing you to take more general electives and pick up a minor or two.",

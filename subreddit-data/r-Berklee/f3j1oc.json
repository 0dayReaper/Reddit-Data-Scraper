    "postText": "I'm terrified, but also super excited! I'm not great at my instrument, but I feel confident in my accomplishments as a musical entrepreneur. I'm kind of banking on the fact that maybe not a lot of cellists apply (especially to MP&amp;E). I'm auditioning with \"The Swan,\" so it's super simple and almost every cellist can play it by 15 years old. However, I am comfortable with it, but it might be TOO simple. I don't know...\n\nPlease feel free to help me loosen up about it all, thank you!",

If they don't say anything, don't stress it. Remember that they're people and they're looking for potential, not perfection. Good luck! You'll do great :)",

Another thing that helped me was reminding myself that the jury are very good at seeing through nervousness and discerning your real musical abilities. Trust yourself, but trust the jury too while you're at it. Makes it easier to not beat yourself up afterwards too if you feel you messed something up.",

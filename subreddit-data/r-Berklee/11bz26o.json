    "postText": "had my audition for vocals yesterday - I got cut off midway through my song which really confused me because it was going really well. They then asked me to sing something more contemporary (I sang a classical piece) so I sang a musical theatre piece. I played the track off my phone and so my timing with the track was pretty here and there because I couldn\u2019t hear the accompaniment too well but the rest was good. My ear training, sight singing and improv went really well too. Is it a bad sign that they cut my prepared piece off?",

Although you will not declare your major for your first few semester as your time will be taken up by core classes. You will have the opportunity to test out of said classes though. Campus opens again in the third I believe so at that time I reccomend contacting academic advising and seeing what you can do. Hope that helps",

You made me realize it\u2019s probably best to take some of my lib arts courses I found on my Grid before coming in instead of the pro tools course - might help make my first few semesters easier so I can focus on other things. I\u2019ll def. call my advisor to ask about this though. Grateful for your time.",

It will be good practice for you to get used to writing them, but your songwriting itself is what you\u2019ll generally be critiqued on. I didn\u2019t know Lee well, but my impression was always that she was kind and I think she\u2019d be a constructive and supportive prof. I\u2019d definitely give her a try! When I took Songwriting 1 I honestly had a prof I didn\u2019t click with and who didn\u2019t get my music/wasn\u2019t familiar with my influences. I still got a lot out of it!",

He\u2019s a fantastic teacher and writer and he knows his shit. Some people don\u2019t like how strict he is in SW1 for the forms, tools and what not but those concepts are really important to digest so that you can break away from them later. \n\nAlso like the other person said - don\u2019t worry about the lead sheets! You will get better at them over time if you keep at it. Just do the work and get it in on time. One of the other amazing teachers (Pat Pattison) often says something like \u201cMost of your job as a writer is writing a lot of crap. Crap makes for good fertilizer. Use your crap to grow because 90% of your writing will never be your best 10%.\u201d",

He\u2019ll definitely correct any notation and harmonic spelling errors but that\u2019s good feedback to have, it\u2019ll make you a much stronger writer. \n\nHonestly, I didn\u2019t know what to make of him the first couple of weeks but he\u2019s great once the whole class has warmed up to each other (and him) and the process gets moving along.",

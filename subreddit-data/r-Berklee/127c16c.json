            "comment": "Hi! I applied this year in voice. (Obviously certain advice is going to vary because of instrument type fyi). My audition actually went horrific because I got sick, I had to change my song the morning of and lower the key so I was able to sing it, but even then I could barely sing. Honestly though I think the part that sold me for them was my improv was really really strong. I didn\u2019t use any of their tracks, but I always practice improv with literally any song\u2014 it helps you to think better on your feet. I feel like if you use their tracks, you might start to practice a similar melody over time which is not the best to do because I think they can honestly tell. Also, my interview went super well. I honestly think having a \u201cbad\u201d audition helped me chill out for my interview and be able to just talk. I talked a lot about collaboration as well which is something the interviewer seemed to really like. I think that is why I got in lol.\n\nAnyways, that was a lot of words and I really don\u2019t have a lot of advice, but tdlr: practice improving over everything and prep for the interview. I don\u2019t know if that is super helpful, but \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

            "comment": "i got in, but i got in in december. i applied for ??????? ?????????? ???????????? ????????? \nyeah basically i have absolutely no clue what happened before my audition because my mum did it all for me, and i just prepped. I did the online audition though! so there was a bit of advice out there for those and i read through them. I think what helped is that i was originally a trained classical pianist + i have perfect pitch so improv was a breeze. i think i could have done better though because they gave me a really hard sight reading after they found out i could do the rest \ud83d\ude2d",

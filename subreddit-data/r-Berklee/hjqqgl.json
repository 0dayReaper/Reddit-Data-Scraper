            "comment": "They do make a difference as they are equivalent to however many credit you took for Berklee Online. For example, Berklee Online ensemble classes are 3 credits so when you transfer them over to on-campus Berklee then they are 3 credits. You just need to email Berklee Online and tell them to transfer the credits over.",

This process usually takes about two weeks or so. But with current situations it may take a bit longer as Berklee is understaffed at the moment.",

I\u2019ve heard things like wearing a suit (which I always wear in performances for my school) is way too extra, but I also don\u2019t want to be underdressed either. Any ideas?",

All in all, though, dress how you feel most comfortable while staying \u201cclassy.\u201d You want to present yourself to them in the best way possible. Look your best! Good luck!",

They are 100% about what you do, not what you look like. \n\nAt the same time, just like... wear a decent pair of jeans/shoes and decent collared shirt. Maybe add a nice sweater since it's cold outside. No need to wear a tux. Just be comfortable and rock it. Style points is not their goal here. \n\nCompared to other universities, this is one of the most casual I know of.",

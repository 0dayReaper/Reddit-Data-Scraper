    "postText": "Hello Berklee!\n\nI was wondering if anyone was interested in collaborating with me on the weekends to make some music and learn from each other's techniques on the Maschine MK3. I have been at it for about a year and a half now (since quarantine) and while I am happy with a lot of what I have produced, I feel like I am just scratching the surface on how I can best utilize this wonderful instrument. I want to improve as a producer, and while I do my best to follow along with youtube tutorials, I know that the best way for me to improve is to meet with other producers and exchange ideas. We could meet over Zoom. I typically work on music during the weekend mornings (I am located in Boston, so east coast USA time). I also use Logic X, but I am trying to do most of my work, including arrangements, within Maschine. \n\nHere is my SoundCloud (I have a bunch of other projects not on Soundcloud yet, just let me know if you would like me to send you those): [https://soundcloud.com/david-zisson](https://soundcloud.com/david-zisson)\n\nI like to produce soulful, jazzy hip hop (9th wonder/ old kanye style) and electronic music (odesza, polo &amp; pan, etc...) but I am open to almost all genres. If you are interested, get at me! Thanks!",

    "postText": "Hey y'all! \n\nCongrats if you were accepted into '27! \n\nI took the online auditions and was accepted for September 2023 entry as an international student in around December 2022. My family wasn't sure whether I should go, and gauged for a lot of groupchats. I'm Chinese (from outside China), but my mum managed to find a few groupchats that had hundreds of Chinese incoming '27s, as well as lots of information about Berklee and discussion about, just about anything. There has also been groupchats for housings, associations for concerts, furniture buy&amp;sell, etc. \n\nI just wanted to know whether anyone knows something like that in the English community? I've searched discord and reddit which are the two main places I could think of. I would definitely like to make one if you guys are interested, just so we could talk (also dorms in Berklee are pretty bad, but most people still choose to live there first year because they want a social life, so if we have a social life before that then we can live in a better environment!) and discuss anything!! \n\nAnd for those who would like to go to Berklee, and those who were not accepted, and those who want to reapply, they are ofc welcome to join too! I'd just like to establish a community for everyone on preferably discord! \n\nPls lmk if you guys are interested &lt;3",

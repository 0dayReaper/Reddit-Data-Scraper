    "postText": "I'm a student at the University of Vermont studying Music Tech and Business - Berklee was my dream school throughout high school, and I got in with scholarships, but it wasn't enough money to justify me going. Was thinking of reapplying since I've improved significantly from that audition, but the one thing that's really holding me back is that I've met some fantastic people here that will be so hard to leave. Vermont has some great professors too, and I love being here for the most part, but I'm lacking the connections and collaboration that comes with being surrounded by musicians (plus Berklee is closer to home for me). I am so heavily considering transferring, but I would love to know: is it worth it/ should I transfer now? Should I stick it out in VT for another year &amp; see if I still want to transfer? I know nobody can really answer that question, but I keep going back and forth.",

Berklee isn\u2019t as great as it used to be anymore and the level deteriorated insanely in the past 2-3 years and their focus shifted more on their social media image with the shows and cool cinematography and what not but the reality is that they lowered their standards significantly and it shows with all the entering classes in the past few semesters",

The quality of accepted students continues to decline, and their commitment to broadening the school\u2019s liberal arts programs is worrying - My feeling is that they\u2019re spreading themselves too thin, as evidenced by the low rigor of the Music Business track.",

NO music courses are accepted for credit, though completing college-level music coursework can be beneficial in that you may place higher on the entering student placement exams. That said, it's tough to graduate from Berklee early regardless--there are just so many requirements for the majors, that unless you place out of stuff you'd likely still be looking at 3 or 3 1/2 years of study even if you transfer in the max amount of credits. It's also reaaaaally late to be applying for the fall, and if you put in any more time at Vermont before transferring, you'd be losing money since you're already over the cap for transfer credits.\n\n does sound like you've got a good thing going at Vermont. To be honest I'd recommend\n\nIt sounds like you've got a great thing going at Vermont. My advice would be to stay and finish your degree there, and then think about Berklee for grad school if you're still keen on it. Berklee is great, to be sure, but it's not the be all end all, and don't throw away a good thing just to chase your high school dream.",

I guess I'm just worried about not getting those key connections in the industry - no matter where I wind up, I want to write &amp; produce for the rest of my life. Is it silly to stay just because I have good friends? \n\nAnywho. Thank you frankenplant! I really appreciate your opinion and advice.",

You are probably thinking of credit by exam.\n\nIt's your decision on whether or not to apply, but my advice is just to stay. Berklee is great but it's not the be-all, end-all that people make it out to be. At the end of the day, undergrad is what you put into it, and you can get an incredible music education many places. Ask yourself this: Are you ready to start all over again and put in eight semesters of work if your transfer credits don't get you as far as you think they will?",

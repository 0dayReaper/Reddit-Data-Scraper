My counselor said something about still being able to apply through a third party organization that could offer a scholarship of some sort. \n\nI\u2019m just curious if anybody here did that and what your experience was like. Grateful for your time!",

Also - if you do really well your freshman year you are eligible for a thrive Scholarship from Berklee.  My kid did receive a nice scholarship after freshmen year and that is automatic for remaining 3 years as long as basic standards are met.",

    "postText": "I'm very interested in taking the Music Theory or Music Theory and Composition certificate programs but I don't know which one would be better suited for me. I wanna go with the one that would be best to help me in understanding some theory and also help me in coming up with melodies, counter melodies, chord progressions and the like that can help me up my music production game. Now that I'm looking at my question it seems like Music Theory and Composition would be better, but I would still like any thoughts or inputs on my question.",

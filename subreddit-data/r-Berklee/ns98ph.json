    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI\u2019m an MPE major going through Creative Production Skills. I need to find musicians to produce, and record a track, for a class. A string trio would be ideal, but can work with other musicians. \n\nDue to Covid restrictions, I can\u2019t have horn players or vocalists. Basically nothing you blow air through. \n\nIf you are anyone you know thinks this would be a good opportunity to have possibly your original produced and recorded in a multi million dollar studio, by students who are being trained to produce and engineer professionally, please feel free to contact me and let\u2019s chat. \n\nThank you all for your time.",

But, if there is a group (or composer) that has something really good ready to go, I am open to hearing their stuff, and possibly let that be the song. We students would have our projects, and the group could have their originals professionally recorded. Win-win. \n\n\nI hope that helps. \ud83d\ude42",

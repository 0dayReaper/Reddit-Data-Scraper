I\u2019ll give you the one piece of advice I give all Berkleeites: spend more time in the library and playing your instrument(s) than anything else. Yes, the band scene is fun, and there\u2019s always a party somewhere, but finding rehearsal space is a mountain climb, scheduling around classes is a nightmare, and the sad fact is that most people lose touch after graduation. And if Beth Denisch is still around the Comp department, latch on and learn everything you can from her. She\u2019s brilliant. I miss her dearly. \n\nTake Yoga for Musicians (for credit) if you get stressed out, or walk down to the large reflecting pool at the Mary Baker Eddy Center. It\u2019s my favorite place on the planet.",

It\u2019s a flaw (that even Victor Wooten was critical of) but don\u2019t sweat it too much. Ranking mostly doesn\u2019t affect your credit hours or your student experience, unless there\u2019s a course that requires a higher level. There ARE ways around that, though. \n\nThe best way to get what you want out of Berklee, like I said, is to shadow professors as much as possible. Make yourself known to the faculty, more than the students. \n\nBest of luck!",

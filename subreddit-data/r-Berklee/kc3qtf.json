    "postText": "i auditioned for berklee on piano today, and it was a really fun experience! this has been my first college audition ever so this whole week i\u2019ve been so nervous, but the rumors are true; they are really nice and laid back here.\n\nmy audition was scheduled for 2:30 so i logged into the zoom meeting at 2, and there i was in the waiting room with a lot of other auditioners and i warmed up. everyone looked really cool and laid back and they just seemed like good people. \n\nthey were running behind but i got invited into my audition breakout room around 2:50 and there were two people auditioning me. one of them stayed quiet the entire time, and the other talked me through the audition. we started with a few questions so they could get to know me as a musician and then i played my prepared piece. i think it went pretty well, it was a good performance for me. then she asked if i\u2019ve ever done improv and i answered honestly that i\u2019d never really done it before. what i ended up doing was playing with the tracks anyway but just accompanied until the solo section. i couldn\u2019t really do both hands but i tried my hardest, it\u2019s just where i am right now, and if it\u2019s the reason i don\u2019t get in then i\u2019m just not meant to go here. but generally they were still supportive and sweet. then we did sight reading, and for me personally it was pretty easy but i couldn\u2019t find a good place to put my computer so i had a hard time seeing the music and she tried to figure out a place for me to put it so i can see it so that was a little flub but i still think i did well. the first section was really easy, basic, sight reading. the second selection was a bit harder but still pretty basic. the third she just asked me to play chords. then we moved on to ear and rhythm training. and honestly that was a bit harder than i thought it was going to be but i got most of them right except for the ones on the end she had to help me out to get them. the only part i really screwed up in was in identifying seventh chords, i\u2019m not really that good with seventh chords but i tried to learn as i went through the audition with her. she had me sing back stuff and play stuff positioned on middle c, and then she had me identify whether chords were major, minor, diminished or augmented. and then she had my sing back rhythms. the rhythms were pretty complex. \n\ni\u2019m not entirely sure where i stand, but it was a lot of fun and i genuinely enjoyed myself while doing it so whether i get in or not, i\u2019m glad i did it. she was very sweet to me and told me i was doing good regularly. she said i played very lovely and she really enjoyed listening to me and it could be niceties but often times you don\u2019t hear that in auditions so i felt very reassured. it was challenging, but regardless it was a good time and it just felt like they were trying to get to know me not as much assess if i\u2019m good or not.\n\nthen i finished and i went back to the waiting room and about a minute later i was invited to another breakout room for my interview. the interviewer was a young guy, he seemed like a student and he was super duper sweet and it felt more like a relaxed conversation rather than an interview. he was typing as i was saying stuff but he said that\u2019s what he always did to take notes. he asked me the basic 4 questions that are on the website so i would prepare those. and then he asked me questions based on my answers so he would ask me to go more in depth with what i did in school and stuff, but there were no oddly specific out of left field type of questions. if you prepare you will be fine.\n\noverall, i came out of it feeling great. it was genuinely so fun, and much less scary than i thought. the professors and the student were so supportive and nice, you really have nothing to be scared about. the audition was definitely challenging and not a walk in the park but it wasn\u2019t intimidating. i kind of have no idea where i stand. musically, i feel a little out of place as i\u2019ve always been a classical pianist and haven\u2019t dabbled much in anything modern, but i really want to learn it and i made that clear in my audition and interview so maybe they\u2019ll take that into consideration. this seems like a really amazing school.\n\nto anyone who\u2019s auditioning; firstly i want to say congratulations for making it to this point in your music journey, you should be proud of yourself. but also, as long as you prepare, you shouldn\u2019t be nervous. at the end of the day they just want to see if you\u2019re a good match and it really is quite a laid back audition process. i believe in you, and good luck!! :)",

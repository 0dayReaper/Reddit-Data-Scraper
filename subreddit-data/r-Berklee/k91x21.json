    "postText": "Hi,\n\nIn the audition, I decided to ignore the repeating sign in the sight reading exercises because it would repeat the same bars again, which I had already sight read correctly. I did this because I felt it would just waste the time to play again the exact same thing, and wanted to save time for the more complex exercises.\n\nDo you think that would make them think that I didn't notice the repeating signs? Because obviously they got an idea of how I sight read (I played every exercise they gave me correctly, with a few mistakes that I immediately corrected).",

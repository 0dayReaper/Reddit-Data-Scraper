    "postText": "So have had an experience with my auditions that is kind of perplexing.  I am a violinist and applied and auditioned to MSM, UNT, and Berklee for Jazz studies.  I was immediately, as in the same day as the audition, accepted into both MSM and UNT for jazz studies, but waitlisted for Berklee?  I am not understanding how that works or why given both of the other programs are far more selective.  I mean I obviously have options of where to go, it is just confusing that it occurred and I thought maybe others might have insight into how that works.",

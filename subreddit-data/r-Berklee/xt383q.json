    "postText": "I'm a local film student (not from Berklee) looking to get a portfolio together this year, searching for an artist/ group to collaborate with on a music video. I've got equipment, experience, and a crew. I'm looking for an artist who's a good creative fit, so send me a link to your music and I'll get back to you. I'm really passionate about this kind of stuff, so I'm gonna make sure whatever we come up with looks great. I'll handle direction/ production, but let's come up with a concept we're excited about together!",

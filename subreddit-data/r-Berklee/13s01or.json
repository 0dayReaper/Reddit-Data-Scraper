    "postText": "Hi! I am a current student at Berklee NYC and am finishing up here in July. I'm moving back to my home country and am hoping to find someone to fill my room. At the moment, its a safe place for someone to land from July 11th-August 31st, with potential to sign on for another year. My roommate also goes to Berklee and is planning on staying in NYC post-graduation.\n\nWe had a tough time finding places to live when we first made plans to move to NYC, so i thought i'd see if anyone from next year's cohort needs a place :) \n\nAbout the room:\n\nI live in the Upper East Side in a super friendly neighbourhood and secure building. We are right out the front of the Q train, so there are no issues with safety coming home at night too. It is a 2BR apartment, my roommate will be present in August. \n\nThe room will have the large pieces of furniture in it for your use including single bed (convertible to a double), Desk, empty wardrobe, and additional storage should you need it.\n\nThis sublet would be $2500 for the total cost, including bills. \n\nIf you have any additional questions or are interested please shoot me a dm!",

    "postText": "I auditioned last month (November 2021) for the May 2022 enrollment. I know they have to let us know by March 30- but does everyone wait until then or do they let people know ahead even while others are still auditioning? The person who interviewed me said I would hear in a few weeks but I am seeing that the audition window is like Sept- Feb for the May enrollment. I really hope I don't have to wait all the way until March!",

            "comment": "It may be helpful to consider that there is some difference between scholarships and financial aid. While there is a lot of crossover, scholarships may weigh merit (talent, area of interest, biographical information) more than financial need. While financial aid is rooted more in demonstration of financial need. \n\nThat said, Berklee\u2019s culture stresses that financial need is a huge component of granting institutional aid to students, I don\u2019t know the details of its policies. But institutional aid is listed as being automatically considered based on FASFA and CSS Profiles. \n\nOver the past 5 years Berklee\u2019s largest focus has been on expanding aid for those with financial need. \n\nThere are just so many, many factors involved. Reach out to the financial aid office, explore all options that are available. Nothing is handed out.",

I also think it helped that I am a violinist that knows harmony and ear training well so it\u2019s a combination of both things that with determine how much you get.",

What about other people at Berklee that you know? Were there a lot of kids getting scholarships that weren\u2019t from wealthy families?",

If your family has a certain amount of money, you'll be afforded opportunities that allow you to excel musically beyond the level of your peers. The other side of this coin is that Berklee high key profits from the fact that they take advantage of less fortunate students that can't quite make ends meet or get attention from their teachers. Those students are offered just enough so that they'll still have to severely struggle, and this isn't so much scholarship money as unsubsidized loans.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLikewise, rich kids are more likely to take on more majors, minors, and other such financially draining auxiliaries to their already exorbitantly priced bachelor's programs. This evens things out and keeps turning the school a profit. The whole thing is a scam, really, but the trick is being smart and cutting your losses when it stops paying off. The online degree is cheaper and faster, and easier, making it a great backup plan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMerit-based scholarships are also awarded based on teacher recommendations, and wealthy, privileged kids with better musical backgrounds get noticed by teachers while the others are left to fall by the wayside. It's a super toxic culture with heavy nepotism and I wouldn't bet on getting scholarship money.",

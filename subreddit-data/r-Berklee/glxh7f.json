All that matters is that it\u2019s music you personally connect with, and you have the technical facility to execute it well. If it\u2019s a song you love and it sounds good when you play it, go for it!",

            "comment": "This was the exact time I committed to Berklee and started working on an audition piece as well- You should have plenty of time to assess your options and get the song up to muscle memory.  Highly recommend you play slightly under your skill level- There shouldn\u2019t be a section that after months of practice you have to roll the dice on.  That was the one mistake I made, and while I ultimately got lucky, some parts were right on the edge of my ability and made the process much more stressful without truly adding much to my audition.  Europa is a killer track, good luck man!",

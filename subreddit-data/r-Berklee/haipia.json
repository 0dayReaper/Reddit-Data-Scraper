    "postText": "This might be the longest shot ever, but...\n\nI was accepted to Berklee as a vocal principal in late 2006, and with my acceptance letter, they sent me a CD of all kinds of music made by the current students. I think it was called New from Berklee and I loved it. \n\nIt got lost in a disaster along with my digital copies, so I'm wondering if it exists anywhere now. It seems that the students' recording studio website isn't there anymore, and I don't know where else to look.\n\nI couldn't actually attend Berklee because I couldn't afford tuition plus life in Boston, so that record was all kinds of wistful for me, and I'd love to hear it again. \n\nAny ideas?",

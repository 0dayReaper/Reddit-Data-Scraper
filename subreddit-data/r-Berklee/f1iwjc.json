    "postText": "Hello there,\n\nFor context, I'm a student in the UK who has applied to study at the Boston Conservatory. My audition is in around a couple of weeks. My prepared piece is a composition of mine (a reharmonisation of Moon River) which consists of me playing multiple instruments (mainly piano and vocals, with bass and drums as well).\n\nI'm curious about any tips when it came to the audition. I watched several application help videos, and though they have been helpful, some contradict others. The general consensus says that the prepared piece is the most important, but other things seem to have mixed responses. For example, some say that you shouldn't worry as much you can't sight read properly whilst others say that they won't accept anyone who can't sight read. My sight-reading and improvisation skills are alright but I wonder if it's worth it to work on these or to continue practicing my prepared piece.\n\nAny tips would also be really helpful.\n\nThank You.",

            "comment": "I\u2019ll speak on what I experienced and that\u2019s all. I auditioned for summer semester in July. I played Malague\u00f1a on guitar as my prepared piece and also wrote an original. \n\n\nI cannot sight read music at all.  But I love it. I feel it. I can play it. It wakes me up every day and puts me to rest every night. I put my all into conveying that, and even when I couldn\u2019t identify a chord or tell them what note was what on a page, my passion mixed with my proficiency at the instrument was enough. I got accepted. Never feel like you have to follow a set guideline that will only work if you do EXACTLY what other people tell you. I didn\u2019t join this sub until after I got my acceptance because I knew reading other people\u2019s experiences would fill me with doubt. In my eyes, they just want to see people who will bleed for their art. Who will go to great lengths to be honest and direct about what they are capable of. So my advice to you? \n\n\nPlay as if your life depended on it. Play with vigor. With passion. Play as if you were using the music to describe a sunset to a blind man. Put all your heart into it and do not stray away from the truth. If you can\u2019t sight read , be honest but *do not look ashamed.*. You are more than just the technical skills a musician can develop. Be honest , be up front and do not bat an eyelash in self doubt. Unflinching resolve. You have gotten to the point where you have the audition. That is more than enough proof that you are worthy of getting in. I believe in you friend.",

They even wished me luck personally when I thanked them for giving some insight into their own audition process. Plus, it's nice that you can hear how much they like music by the way they talk about it. If anything, they seem more fitting to go to Berklee.\n\nAnd then you come in and call them an asshole for what, answering a question? I don't know about you, but it's kind of ironic when that's what you come off as right now. Keep acting like that and you won't last in Berklee, let alone in the world.\n\nHave a nice day mate.",

Even I said I think, because it was what I believe, and it lined with something called common sense. You really expect a music school to rip apart someone just because they like music. Amazing find, Sherlock.\n\nWhat I did do is call you out on your crap. You said something that not only contributed nothing to the conversation, but also continued to amazingly shit talk your way to the comments section, showing a level of arrogance I cannot actually comprehend. I mean you came to a post talking about auditions and haven't even said anything that linked to it, despite you comprising of half of the comments in this comment section. Like, you haven't had many conversations before, have you?\n\nBut to your original point. I do not know how to survive in Berklee. But I think I know people who do, the interviewers. Their whole job is to see if someone is capable of studying there, and the fact that this guy passed shows that the interviewers thinks that they have the skill provided to study there potentially for 3 years. You in Berklee mate? If they are willing to accept despicable people like you, I'm more than happy to believe this person is going to thrive there.\n\nHere's a good tip for you. You can say all the bullshit you want but you better expect to get called out. Actually respond properly to something. Don't dish it if you can't take it.",

They\u2019ll look at sight reading, improvising, your ear, and you as a person (there\u2019s a one on one interview after your playing audition). \n\nYour playing sounds good, do you have a prepared piece in mind? You want to have something you can play in and out that represents you as a musician. Good luck!",

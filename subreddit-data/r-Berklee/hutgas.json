    "postText": "I\u2019m a self taught vocalist, and I\u2019ve been performing since I was 8 years old. I don\u2019t know how to play any instruments or how to read music, but I have a 20 piece jazz/swing big band. I applied to berklee for this upcoming spring as a transfer student, and I have my audition August 12th, but I\u2019m worried about not knowing how to read music. Do you think that\u2019ll be a deciding factor in whether or not I\u2019m accepted?",

You want to go to music school to learn and that's something you will need the learn, so why not in college. Have all your other bases covered and you should be fine. Review the interview questions on their website.",

I have 0 ability to read music, and I didn\u2019t get accepted, and in trying to figure out why I didn\u2019t get in, I really think that was the reason :/ however, i\u2019ve also heard stories of people who were bad at reading and got in. It\u2019s truly a gamble depending on when you audition, how many spots are open for your instrument, etc. So if you want to give yourself the best shot, go in knowing how to read :) best of luck to you friend!",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, I would so appreciate people responding to this coz I don\u2019t know which way to go! Basically, I want to apply for the MA in Songwriting and Production in Berklee NYC.\nI\u2019m currently going into my final year of my undergrad in music education. It\u2019s a pretty prestigious degree, they accept 10 of us a year (sorry why does this sound like I\u2019m boasting lol just relevant to my question\ud83d\ude2d). It\u2019s classical based, we specialise in one instrument and mine is piano, my teacher is a Juilliard graduate and concert pianist and I think it\u2019s fair to say that I\u2019m proficient at piano. \nEven though I\u2019m so grateful for the experience, classical music just is not the way for me. It never really was, but I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do at 17 and here I am\ud83d\ude2d However, I am so passionate about pop music and songwriting. I have perfect pitch (not trying to flex once again I\u2019m sorry if I come across badly, just giving an idea of my musicianship as I think it\u2019s relevant), and playing my songs, as well as the music I actually like, on piano has always been my happy place. I really want to give this a shot and audition.\nNow finally to where I\u2019m stuck\ud83d\ude02 I know for sure I want to move to New York when I graduate. Where I live, there are 2 ways in which I can do this - by getting a visa to study there, OR a graduate visa for 12 months that is only valid the year after I graduate (\u201824) interning somewhere related to the field in which I studied (classical music/education). Essentially I am wondering, do you think it would be better to i) apply for the masters right after I graduate (\u201824) or ii) should I do the graduate visa and apply the following year (\u201825)? \nAlso if anyone has any advice or knows what sort of standard they are looking for I would be so grateful for any advice. \nApologies it took me a while to get there\ud83d\ude02 I would really appreciate anyone\u2019s thoughts on this!",

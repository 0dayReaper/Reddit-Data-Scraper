I decided to apply for Berklee and now am just waiting for my audition date. Super excited! \n1. So the career path that I want to do is be a professional studio musician (vocalist) for Disney/dreamworks and video game companies. I\u2019ve always loved listening to the choirs in movies like moana and stuff like that and it\u2019s a dream of mine to be able to do stuff like that for a living. One of questions I have is does Berklee have some sort of partnership for that field? It can even be commercial music as well. \n2. These is a question for transfer students. How much of your credits were you able to transfer? Also how much time did you save as well? Was it hard to make friends or was it normal? \n3. If you\u2019re a student at Berklee, overall what do you like best about it?",

What path do you guys plan to take/have taken? I'm just a little concerned that it'll be tough finding a job with my degree lol. \n\nEspecially since it's a music school, classes like multivariable and econ aren't available so I'd have to find SOMEthing in music.",

If you want to be in a professional choir you're going to want to work more on your chops, sight reading, etc. whereas if you want to start or be in a band you'll want to focus more on business, mixing, production, etc.\n\nThis may all change as well. I went into berklee thinking I'd major in songwriting and ended up falling in love with synths and production, and ended up majoring in EPD.\n\nThe whole \"the odds are low\" thing is a copout in my opinion. If you visualize a target and think critically about the kinds of people you want to connect with and the skills you want to collect, you aren't relying on odds.\n\nI dont mean any of this to come off as harsh, btw. I just want you to think more critically and clearly about your goals.",

So given that goal you're probably going to want to major in songwriting, while taking classes in recording, mixing, production, business (licensing, touring, promotion, etc.).\n\nClasses aside though, the main thing I recommend is to make as much music as possible. Don't worry if you think it's not up to your standards. Show it to your teachers and get feedback on your latest song at least once a week. Rapid iteration is more important than trying to write a single home-run song. Starting out, you might write one good song out of 100, and as you write more, that number will drop to 1 in 50, 1 in 20, etc.\n\nTeam up with an older MP&amp;E student or teacher and ask them to mix it for you and watch their process. Learn about different microphones and how to record yours and other instruments. Ask where the MP&amp;E or EPD department is, find literally any teacher and ask if they have a student they can connect you with to collaborate. I WISH I did this more when I was there.\n\nCompile a list of record labels that sign artists similar to you and send all of them your tracks, regularly. Make them sound as good as possible but don't let perfection keep you from hitting send. Most of them will say no at first but will usually offer good feedback. Keep sending tracks to them until they say yes.\n\nTo address the original post, no, just graduating with Berklee on your resume won't land you a job in the same way a CS degree from MIT will. It's not about the degree at all, but assembling an array of skills that combined will put you far ahead of someone who hadn't been exposed to all that stuff I mentioned above.",

If you want to put 100% of your focus and energy into writing and singing, you're going to want to find one or more engineers &amp; producers you gel really well with that will get the sound to radio standards.\n\nOn spotify if you open an album/EP under the last track you can see [copyright] 2020 - Record Label Name. Just google that and find their email address and drop it into a text file. Get a list going of maybe 10-20.\n\nRecord labels not only release your music to a wider audience but also have connections to booking managers. Assuming this covid shit goes away before you start school, and they like your music, they will get you booked. This might take awhile though. Until that happens, google Boston band venues and personally give them your demo flash drive or a link to your website which would have bio, pictures, and your music. Wix or Squarespace are very easy to use to make that.",

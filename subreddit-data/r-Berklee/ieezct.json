    "postText": "I\u2019ve been playing guitar since I was 8 years old and now I\u2019m 18. I applied for Berklee and auditioned, but I didn\u2019t get in. I\u2019m re-applying and I\u2019m currently taking the Berklee online mixing class which I have an A in. If you get a B or higher you get college credits and I\u2019m pretty sure that helps your chances of getting in. I had no clue how to read music going into that audition and I was so nervous I ended up messing up a bit. I really didn\u2019t do well on the improvisational part, but I\u2019m way better than that. I also started practicing my audition piece 4 days in advance so I had to choose an easier piece, \u201cLittle Wing\u201d by \u201cJimi Hendrix\u201d. I know that\u2019s super stereotypical. I really want to get into Berklee and I\u2019ve been practicing my sight reading. I just can\u2019t decide on an audition piece. Also, I only got to play one song, \u201cLittle Wing\u201d when I thought there were two songs your aloud to perform. Are you only aloud one piece? I was thinking of doing ONLY the solo from \u201cKid Charlamagne\u201d by \u201cSteely Dan\u201d as well as another piece probably a classical or jazz piece. Would you recommend not doing this? Do you only get one audition piece? I need to start practicing the audition piece now so please help me out. What did you audition with?",

Play something you can play confidently and musically and that shows the direction you\u2019d be going at the school (aka don\u2019t play a jazz tune if you\u2019re not a jazzer just cuz you think that\u2019s what they want)",

Please let me know your honest opinion on it. Also, there\u2019s no backing track for it so would it be okay to play along to the actual recording with the guitar in it already?",

Give the time of day to listening to the guitar parts on Rickie Lee Jones Pop Pop album. Subtle, Soulful and exquisite I think - but it does include a cover of Up From the Skies so not Hendrix free entirely!. Just going off the treadmill of tunes they hear every audition day may help you along no end. For me her choice of musicians on most albums is next level, so maybe check out The Magazine and Flying Cowboys as well. If nothing inspires you there, go back to plan A.",

I did that and they loved it because they were able to listen very well to my playing. I bet is annoying when you have to play over a track and there are some articulations differences and basically just your way of playing that song! Best of lucks to you, and as everyone have told you by now, just have fun and enjoy that every moment!",

I\u2019d say any of Polygondwanaland would be sick to audition with btw",

Be able to play as many different styles as you can. Berklee likes well-rounded musicians, they have a higher chance of being successful in the future than someone who's a one-trick pony. You're replying to the best music school in the world, if you think practicing your prepared peace for only four days is enough, that might also be part of the issue. Those instructors are smart enough and have been around long enough to know how long someone has practiced, they want someone that's going to be dedicated and it's going to put in the time to get better, because in the end when one of their students become successful, that's advertising for them.",

Although, don\u2019t they start accepting less and less people as they fill up from earlier auditions. So maybe it would be better to do the audition before even January possibly December?",

I brought this up to my advisor an she squashed that. \n\nBerklee has a standard they want all their students to be at before they even consider to accept you. Then comes the interview. I would bet that the interview is more important than the audition. That's where they determine how hard you're going to work while you are in school. They would rather accept someone that is a little below their standards but is willing to work their ass off over the good player that is a slacker. \n\nI would be willing to bet that if you showed up at your next audition and were able to play in most styles and have at least a little freedom to fill and solo a bit in each style, have a basic understanding of reading, and make it known that you want to learn as much as you can while you are at Berklee, you'll have a better result. \n\nThink if you were the president of the school, what kind of students would you want at you college? Be that type of student.",

I\u2019m going to start ASAP on my audition piece this time, but I need to pick something and commit to it first which I\u2019m having a problem doing. Also, I did a much shorter version of Little Wing from my lack of time. I also made the last part of it into a jazz rendition of sorts. My favorite band that I\u2019ve been obsessed with for a few years now is King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard. I\u2019ve always been heavily into sphycadelec rock and went through a huge Pink Floyd faze. I also used to really be into grunge but not so much at all anymore. I enjoy jazz especially stuff like Herbie Hancock which definatley has a more funk feel to it sometimes.",

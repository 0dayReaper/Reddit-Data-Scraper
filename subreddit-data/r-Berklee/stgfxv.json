    "postText": "It has now been one month since I auditioned (1/15/22) and I haven\u2019t seen anything yet. That is understandable, but it has me overthinking. So I want to play out my audition to you guys to see if I really did a good job.\n\nSo the stage is set on a Saturday morning, me and my mom drive up to Boston pretty early to avoid traffic. We left around 9:30 and arrived at the audition place around 11:30. My audition was scheduled for 2:00 so I figured I would just wait there until then, but the people at the table informed me that because I was here so early, they would be able to fit me in to audition right then. I was nervous, but I said it was okay and they sat me down in that room with all the chairs and that big screen showing everyone\u2019s name. The room had only a few people waiting so I figured I wasn\u2019t intruding on someone else\u2019s time. I waited a few minutes before being called into my audition. A lady directed me to a practice room where I waited for about 20 minutes. In this time I got myself warmed up and sang my piece a few times (I sang Donny Hathaways A Song For You btw) \n\nWhen my warmup time was done, the same lady from before directed me to the audition room, where I would wait until the performer inside was done. When he finished I walked in and I was very nervous, I don\u2019t get nervous with stuff, but this, this had me shaking, it was so bad. Inside there was a lady and a man, who were both very welcoming and nice. Me and them conversed for a few minutes while I was getting my track set up and they asked questions like \u201cwhat music classes do you take in school?\u201d And \u201cwhy are you singing the song you\u2019re singing?\u201d All the expected stuff. I then went on to singing my song, feeling much less nervous now that I had been introduced to the people I am singing to. The performance went very well. They seemed very satisfied with my singing, even looking impressed by the high note i belted out. The next part was improv. I informed the man that I played piano, to which he began playing and told me \u201csing something over these chords\u201d. I sang a simple jazzy melody and it was nice. He even modulated and I caught it. Which he pointed out he was impressed by. The next part was sight singing, which I nailed. I forget how many I did but I didn\u2019t make a single mistake. \n\nFinally, the call and response section. This one was so much fun, the man played a simple do re mi melody on the piano and asked me to sing it. He then continually gave me harder melodies. \n\u201cYou\u2019re good, so I\u2019ll give you hard ones!\u201d \nHe said, joyously. This game continued for a while, spiraling into large leaps and odd chromatic phrases. He did the same for the rhythm section, starting with simple rhythms, then diverging into crazy syncopated 16th notes and triplet patterns. I think he even included a quintuplet at some point. You could clearly tell he was having a lot of fun with me, knowing that I am a pretty high level musician for my age. After all that was done, the lady says to me, \u201cYou know, you have a lot going for you.\u201d I swear it was the nicest compliment I\u2019ve ever received.\n\nFollowing the audition, I was sent to my interview. When I entered the elevator to go to the room, I screamed out of happiness knowing it was a good audition. The elevator doors opened, which lead to my interview. I was brought into a younger guys office, and the interview was chill since he and I instantly got along. I answered questions very eloquently and provided insightful reasons for all of my answers (which were completely improvised, not for nothing). When asked how the influence of other students from other cultures would affect and shape my musicianship, I replied \u201cmusic is 10% talent and 90% experience, and I believe that experience is at berklee.\u201d I am still so proud I said that. At that point, the interview had ended, and I went back to the original room I was in when I first entered. My mom had went into the Trader Joe\u2019s next door, so I visited her in there. I literally ran down the escalator I was so excited. The rest of that day came, and went. We hung out in Boston for a few hours, looked at the actual school, and went home. \n\nLooking back a month later. I feel as though it was a very successful audition, everyone seemed impressed with my talents, and drawn in by my personality, but I\u2019m still scared. Berklee is my dream, and I know I have what it takes, but I don\u2019t want to get disappointed by a false sense of hope. So what does everyone think? Do I have a chance? Please let me know.\nSincerely,\nA fellow musician\n\nTLDR; the audition went well, but I still have some nerves surrounding it and would like to learn from others experiences on when I can expect to see my decision. Thank you all for reading",

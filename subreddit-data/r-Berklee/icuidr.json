    "postText": "For context, I'm a non traditional student, transferring in having already earned a degree. I'm entirely self taught, including sight reading and ear training, as well as decent depth into theory concepts (harmonic function, counterpoint, and modal stuff as some examples). A friend recommends I get lessons, even though auditions for the fall '21 semester are happening within a few months. If I were to invest in a teacher (something that's very difficult given my financial situation and covid), how much would it actually help my odds of getting in? I feel like I have a decent grasp of what the audition entails, what more could they teach me?\n\nI understand this is a hard question to answer without an objective depiction of my actual ability, but any insight would be extremely appreciated. Thanks!",

There\u2019s also a good amount of online courses free or paid. Those can get pretty advanced as well. There\u2019s also books you can buy or find free pdf\u2019s of easily. Let me know if you\u2019d like any suggestions!",

Depending on your instrument, not having formal lessons on that instrument will be a death sentence to your ability to be admitted. The entrance audition has less to do with theory and wayyyy more to do with your practical performance and musicianship and ears. Your theory placement comes AFTER admittance. \n\nAlso, \"what more could they teach me?\"- that attitude will get you nowhere. You have so much to learn. That alone indicates that you need private lessons.",

Go on Facebook group Berklee Free and for sale, Berklee off campus housing and Berklee off campus apartment, there are plenty of housing info. My suggestion is live in the dorm for the first semester, making connection is what Berklee can offer best, then find someone to share an apartment.",

I graduated a year early and saved more than $50,000. But a lot of people don't know that they can do that and miss out on the opportunity to study to take the CBXs.

                            "comment": "Now that I'm home I can answer your question in more detail. There is one exam for all freshmen: the ESPA. It comprises of four parts: ear training, harmony 1, writing skills, music tech. Within the exam, there are three other optional components: harmony 2, harmony 3 and arranging 1. This is taken online, before you start school. So if you're starting May 2023, I would guess \n\nAnd then when you're at berklee, you can also take CBXs during your time there. The most common ones to test out of would be traditional harmony, counterpoint and keyboard skills. I've also heard of people testing out of conducting and private instruction. Once you've declared your major, look at the classes required and see which one(s) you'd like to test out of. Look at the department website for CBX information and instructions. If you don't see any for a class you're interested in, see the chair - sometimes they would just give you the final exam for the class, and if you pass, congrats you have your credits! Just ask - the worst they can say is no. \n\nBut since you're starting in May, I would advise that you start studying asap. happy to map out a game plan for you if you'd like. Also, this [article](https://www.clarachanmusic.com/s/stories/i-got-accepted-into-berklee-college-of-music-whats-next) might help you :)",

Between credits from AP/IB in high school (make sure you send results if you did any of those; some will get you credit as well), the cc courses, and taking 1 credit more than a full load a couple times, I was able to graduate a semester early and be part-time my last semester.",

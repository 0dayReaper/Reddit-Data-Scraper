Don\u2019t overthink it, you are going to meet people you will get along with! \n\nDon\u2019t eat the caf food all the time. It will destroy your stomach. \n\nIn 1140, there\u2019s a cafe open in a secret hole in the wall in the Steve Heck room. I forget what it\u2019s called, but I think it\u2019s open in the mornings! \n\nGo to the Caf shows! They are fun :) \n\nAlways get tutoring. Even for classes you think you understand! Tutors can be great friends and also resources for other learning opportunities on campus. \n\nTake Nick Grondin for Ear Training. \n\nDo NOT, and I repeat, DO NOT DATE AT BERKLEE. \nTrust me, this makes things easier for you! \n\nWe have visually impaired students on campus, so if you see one needing help with a door, please don\u2019t hesitate to help! \n\nBe nice to the five week kids in the summer. New things can be scary, and a friendly face goes a long way. \n\nJoin a club if you want! Berklee eSports is awesome (a few semesters ago we had a smash bros / fried chicken night. It was the best) \n\nDon\u2019t tell anyone, but Stan Getz is ALWAYS full during midterms and finals. Want somewhere quiet to go? 8 Fenway, 3rd floor. You\u2019re welcome. \n\nPractice rooms in 150 are abundant, but sometimes icky. I\u2019d recommend getting one in 1120 instead ! (Some of the B level rooms have a keyboard, interface and speakers!) \n\nMake friends with people in other majors. They have access to studio spaces you don\u2019t. \n\nGo to shows, events, whatever you think you\u2019d be into! \n\nPAY ATTENTION TO YOUR BERKLEE EMAIL. literally check that shit like social media. There will be alerts for events on campus, opportunities for performances and things of the like. \n\nTake Amy Bellamy for Harmony (if you\u2019re reading this professor- hi!!) \n\n\nUse studio spaces for things other than projects. You can , and SHOULD, make your own music in there !! \n\nLook out for those FREE FUCKIN MASSAGES in health and wellness dude they are DA BOMB. \n\nSamantha Wilson in case management is your friend. Literally this woman is the reason I am so centered at berklee.  \n\nSay hi to Mingus if you see him, he isn\u2019t scary (but the Booking Office Staff are terrified of him) \n\nLastly, remember you are here for a reason. *ese quam Videri*. To be , rather than to seem. You have displayed talent , mastery and uniqueness that will bring great honor and light to our school. Never question your worthiness! I wish you the best, \n\n\nM",

I am blessed to walk its halls, and I implore you to remember your privilege in doing the same. It will fuel you when your classes get hard. \n\nYou will do just fine.

It may seem counterintuitive - why not fall in love with an artist who also goes to the small ass school I go to? \n\nYea well if you break up you can end up in similar classes, you can be performing with them, or end up having to watch them perform, etc etc. \n\nNot a good vibe! \n\nDo the romance thing elsewhere, and keep berklee strictly musical.

Ask your friends, look up the professors before you choose them; 3) dunno about now but after I finished freshman year, 50% of my friends dropped out, moved to LA and tried to be famous. My advice? Don\u2019t drop out. Because none of them made it out. All of my friends who stayed and got their degree, and made the right friends are making A LOT. \n\nThese are just some general noises that I thought you might want to consider. Not saying that everyone had the same experience but objectively these was relatively factual. Wish you the best of luck!",

The music major made me despise the art itself because of all the judginess.\n\nDon't let college be \"the best time of your life.\" If it is, then by definition, the rest of your life is downhill. Spend as little time on campus as possible and treat it like a job. College is supposed to prepare you for the real working world. Treat it as such and you'll be successful.",

LIE IF YOU HAVE TO (if you are a vocalist). \n\nif not, you get automatically placed in a first semester ensemble called rhythm and grooves (ENVC-111), where you spend the entire semester bringing a song in that you transcribe to sing through once or twice and your prof will tell you the mistakes on your chart. and you can't take another ensemble on top of it. \n\nlook up jazz charts, understand the basic gist of coda's, chords, tabs, sections (as in lettering different parts of the song like the chorus and verse so you can direct the ensemble to play letter A) etc.\n\nallow yourself to avoid the 4-month misery and monotony of that class. take it if you're really actually bad at that kind of stuff, but i (as a vocalist) just never played in a band before but understood counting in 4, cutting people off, and music notation. a week into that class i wanted to d\\*e (and yes, there were people in that class who literally could not count in 4 or conduct in 4 the entire semester)",

Came across [this](https://www.clarachanmusic.com/s/stories/i-got-accepted-into-berklee-college-of-music-whats-next) blog post the other day... #1 really makes sense. and i'm using this time to study for the espa too by taking a course and self studying... someone at my high school graduated from berklee a year early because he got a good score in his entrance exams. im really hoping to do that too\n\nare you starting in september too?",

By all means, study for the ESPA, but don\u2019t take Clara\u2019s class. I studied so hard, and my parents paid a bunch of money just for me to start in MAT.",

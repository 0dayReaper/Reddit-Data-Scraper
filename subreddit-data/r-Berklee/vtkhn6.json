    "postText": "Hey y'all.\n\nAs the title says, I'm not actually attending berklee, but I really miss playing in a band..\n\nI'm an engineering undergraduate at Wentworth. 3rd year in. Our university has 0 musical presence and the only music programs I get offered are in the fall or spring at limited capacity outside of my uni. Also, there's just nowhere to practice. The walls in my dorm are paper thin and there's no facilities here that cater to music at all.\n\nI used to play in my high school wind ensemble as a Bb clarinet. Also played the alto sax in the jazz band. Did semsba, got 3rd chair. I'm mediocre, but I miss it all and want a chance to play again. Was just poking around if there were any opportunities for a fella like me. If not, I'll bug off. Thanks for reading!",

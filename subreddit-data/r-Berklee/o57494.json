    "postText": "Hoping someone here can help me out with this. I recently registered for classes, and I have transfer credits from my previous college, one of which is a literature credit. I registered for one of those literature topics classes (LENG-223) under the assumption that it would qualify as a liberal arts elective credit, but my degree audit has it listed as a repeat course. I\u2019m wondering if anyone here has had a similar experience and knows if this is a mistake in the system or if I should register for another class instead to fulfill the elective credit.",

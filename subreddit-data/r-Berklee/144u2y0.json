    "postText": "The city is just awful for my mental health. I overspend as a coping mechanism, the people are rude, the traffic is awful (I have a car to visit family around the area) I\u2019ve had people tell me to go fuck myself (unprovoked) people calling me disgusting on the sidewalk, death threats from strangers, etc. Boston is a cesspool of degenerates in my opinion and the only reason I live here or will ever cross the city limits, hell, the state line, is because of my education. \n\nI get incredibly angry and depressed when I live here and I don\u2019t know if I can take a whole year of it. I\u2019m currently in Sonoma California for the summer, and am not experiencing any issues here. I hate cities, and I hate that city the most. I\u2019m well traveled, and Boston is the worst place I\u2019ve ever, ever lived.\n\nSorry for the 2nd paragraph rant. I needed to get it off my chest.",

            "comment": "People in Chicago are nice. Depending on why you're at Berklee, you could go to DePaul or Roosevelt through your masters for less, considering cost of living. Plus the pizza is better, the traffic is better, and public transit isn't a dumpster fire.\n\nHell even in New York people are friendlier. Plenty of conservatories there, and you'll actually be able to play out. If you're here for jazz absolutely go there instead.\n\nOut west, there's Cal Arts, UCSD... Hard to say without knowing your program or style of music.\n\nOr you can stay and develop a really thick skin and just get weirdly ok with being kind of miserable, and then you realize that's what everyone else did and that's partially why they're all so rude, so it bothers you less...then next thing you know you are ok with not chatting or making eye contact, and you actually kind of like it this way...\n\nMy condolences about your experience with Boston... It's shit but I love it and I also hate it. Wherever you go, you gotta find your people.",

And the problem with other colleges is that I\u2019ll have to take math and sciences etc which you don\u2019t have to do at berklee. I appreciate the info though and I\u2019ll take a look at your suggestions.",

Mid-sized cities can be where it's at, and I think there's plenty of nature nearby.\n\nI get the urge to dodge those gen eds but don't let that dictate your existence. Getting a BMus is often lighter on those requirements. Hit up a community college and you can get those credits out of the way before you get into the thick of your program.",

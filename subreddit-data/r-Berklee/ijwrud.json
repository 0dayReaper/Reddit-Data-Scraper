    "postText": "This is 1) a specific question on Berklee, and 2) a general question on how I should be thinking about my chances at admission to a conservatory for a Masters in Piano.  \n\nI am 24 years old with a full-time job and college degree (Political Science).  I had some middling musical experience in high school, but nothing aside from that.  I have recently become interested in pursuing music seriously; I am trying to figure out what my options are for doing so.\n\nI have started taking some Berklee Online courses on piano and music theory to get my foot in the water, **but I truly have no experience aside from this.**\n\nSo my question is:  Should I consider a Masters in Piano from Berklee or another conservatory as a possibility for me?  Or am I simply starting too late in my life to be able to become competitive for such a program?",

It can be different and sometimes more difficult. And with that reality also means that the pathways to your goal can be different. \n\nSo, what\u2019s your goal with this pursuit of music? The answer will probably provide you with better informed answers.",

Right now, the most that I can honestly say is that I would love to have music be a part of my career. And, I find the idea of being part of a program where I can focus entirely on cultivating my skill in piano to be really compelling, so that is why I am thinking about a Masters.  I also feel that doing so would give me the space to define exactly what lane I would want to occupy within music.",

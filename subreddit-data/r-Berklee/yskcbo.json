    "postText": "I\u2019ll be attending Berklee in May and wonder whether I should apply for dorm or look for my own apartment.\n\nQuestions I have:\n\n1.) Do you prefer dorms or having your own place? Of course having your own place sounds better but what are some pros and cons of each?\n\n2.) which dorm buildings are best and have private bathrooms and air conditioning?\n\n3.) How safe is it for you to leave your music equipment in your dorm if you have your own room (not sharing with other mates)?\n\n4.) Which locations are best to look at when finding off campus housing?\n\n5.) is it cheaper to get a dorm or your own studio apartment?\n\nI\u2019d be grateful for any other experiences you may want to add that might be useful for new students like me.",

Having your own place is definitely a better living experience but it\u2019s good to stay in dorms the first year so you get to meet people, and just get used to the vibe of the school.\n\n2. 160 and 150 Mass Ave are pretty good, 270 Commonwealth kinda sucks and so does the other dorm, I forget where it is. They\u2019re all fine for your first year but I wouldn\u2019t want to stay in 270 or the other one for more than that.\n\n3. You shouldn\u2019t have to worry about that\n\n4. Not super sure, I believe there are resources on the Berklee website to connect you with off campus housing though.\n\n5. It can be cheaper to go off campus, really depends on the location/overall market tho.",

All I can say is that if you truly want to be a good engineer/producer, you must do work on your own, and lots of it. Depending on the program itself to make you good will not be enough. Do as much of your own creating and producing and mixing as you can. \n\nAlso, the most important things you\u2019ll learn are the small things that professors think are obvious and say off the cuff. Listen intently and work more than what they give you and you\u2019ll progress for sure.",

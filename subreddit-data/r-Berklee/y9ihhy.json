    "postText": "Okay so I\u2019m entirely finished with my application for Berklee but wanted to wait a while just to get my transcripts and everything fleshed out before I apply. It was in this wait that I just discovered that my planned major, MPE, is locked only by people with a 3.7 GPA or higher? I have a 3.6 in high school (graduating this year), so you can see why this is kind of annoying and freaking me out. I also know however that you don\u2019t need a specific major until after the first year, so can I get that GPA while at Berklee and then apply or is it only high school? Or is this information incorrect altogether? I apologize if these are obnoxious or obvious questions, I just really don\u2019t know and have looked for answers for quite some time. I don\u2019t mind taking songwriting as I write songs weekly, but I\u2019d rather major in MPE so I can have the well rounded ability to do both on my own. Also I have not idea how to give them my supplementary materials so. Like do I just Email them or what. Major confusion. Apologies, and thanks.",

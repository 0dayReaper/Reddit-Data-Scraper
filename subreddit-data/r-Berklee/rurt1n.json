Or do I need to have more than 70%? I have 3 yrs of experience in karnatic music and 9 months of voice coaching classes. But I wanted to know if my % is supposed to be more or is it good enough??",

            "comment": "Your grades do somewhat matter, but your audition and interview pretty much weighs the most.  If you do really well in your audition and interview then you have a good shot at getting in even if your grades is on the low end.  I do recommend trying to maintain at least around a 3.0 GPA.  You won't always be doing 100% music related classes, Berklee is a college and they require students to complete a certain amount of liberal art classes, like math, English, Social studies, science, etc in order to graduate.  Also, while your grades don't really matter that much for your admissions, they do when you want to declare a certain major and/or receive scholarships (not from the audition and interview).",

I really don't think that they care too much about grades, I think they only care if you can play. And getting in is not the problem, the acceptance rate is high, the issue is with getting a nice scholarship. You're more likely to get a better offer if you play an in demand instrument like bass or something niche. If you play guitar or voice, you might have a tougher time.",

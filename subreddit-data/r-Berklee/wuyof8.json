Obviously, there are additional requirements for international students, but these are kind of across the board at American colleges. You will have to get a minimum TOEFL score if you are from a non-English-speaking country. Then, you will also have to apply for a student visa. Berklee has a really strong international student community, so I\u2019m sure you will be able to have someone help you navigate the visa process if you\u2019re admitted. Good luck!",

    "postText": "Hey guys I just had a quick question regarding the war training portion of the admissions audition at Berklee. Do we have to sing the melodies back or do we play our instrument to play the melody back? So if I\u2019m auditioning with a piano, will they expect me to like play their melody back on the piano or can I sing the melody back to them? Thank you.",

I am not 100% sure that they always ask you to do it on your instrument if you are an instrumentalist. I am a guitarist and the auditioner(not sure if it\u2019s even a word lol) happened to be a guitar faculty. So that is probably why. Anyway it\u2019s good for you to be ready for both cases because you are gonna have to do \u201csing back\u201d and \u201csight singing\u201d in ear training classes after you get accepted. Hope this helps:)",

            "comment": "My audition was the piano.  From what I remember, they played a single note on the piano and I had to sing that note back (not in solfege, just a \"ta\" or whatever you prefer) and then they would play a short melody on the piano and I would have to play it back on the piano.  I don't think you have to sing the melody back unless your auditioning with voice.  That being side, all audition for everyone can be different even if they audition with the same instrument.  You might have to sing a pitch but not play a melody back, a classmate of mine had this happen.",

They\u2019ll also do a rhythm based section where you clap back or \u2018tah\u2019 back rhythmic phrases that were between 2, 4 and 8 bars. I hope this helps.\n\nI got accepted with a half off tuition scholarship only to realize I still can\u2019t afford to go to Berklee based on my student loans situation. I wish you the best of luck.",

I was wondering if anyone knows if there\u2019s a process for hanging up posters around the school in order to promote an upcoming recital, or if you can just hang them up. Like, do I need to fill out some sort of application or talk to anyone first? I haven\u2019t found anything on the Berklee website, so I\u2019m hoping someone on here will know.",

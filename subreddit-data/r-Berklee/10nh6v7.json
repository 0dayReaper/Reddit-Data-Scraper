            "comment": "Full rides are extremely, extremely rare. From my graduating class, I knew of two people who have received a full ride. One of them I was quite close to. She already had two full length albums and a grammy win from her home country (it's not called a grammy there but it's the same thing, basically). She's able to improvise out of thin air, and tours worldwide on a regular basis with her own jazz band. And she had already graduated from a conservatoire from her home country, with a bachelor of music in performance. She just wanted the Berklee experience on a free ride.\n\nI'm not saying this to discourage you, but it's important to know that full rides are extremely rare. Still, you won't know until you audition, so give it your best shot! I did get a partial scholarship from Berklee. When I auditioned, I was able to improvise (not the best), had a very solid understanding of theory, and was probably above average in ear training. If you're interested you can read about my experience [here](https://www.clarachanmusic.com/s/stories/six-tips-for-getting-into-berklee-college-of-music-and-get-a-scholarship-my-experience-part-1). \n\nFeel free to dm me if you have any more questions!",

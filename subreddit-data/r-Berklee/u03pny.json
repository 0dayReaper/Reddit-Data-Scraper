    "postText": "My son was recently accepted as a transfer for this fall and we are now considering whether to take a dorm room or to find an apartment share. Since he is 21 he isn't eager to share a double or triple, especially because the last two years he has had his own room. However, the off-campus housing prices are blowing me away. For comparison, my daughter is working in Silicon Valley and paying $1,200 for her part of a 2 BR apartment near Apple, Google, and Facebook. I expected to pay that but not almost double.   \n\n\nI've joined the Berklee off-campus housing group on Facebook, and it seems that the yearlong leases being advertised are $2,000+. At the same time, I've noticed a lot of summer sublets in Fenway/Back Bay for around $1,000. Are people subletting at a loss in order to retain their lease, or is there a trick to finding rooms closer to $1,000? I see that going out to Cambridge or farther gets closer to our budget, but he would like to be within walking distance of campus and preferably with other Berklee students. Any clarification from current or former students would be welcome.",

If I can figure out where the lower-priced ones are being posted, I'll definitely go there. Craigslist, maybe? I haven't found a very good response rate for Craigslist in the city where I am now, but maybe it's different for Boston. If I could find a 2 BR for $2,000 that's exactly what I'd be looking for.",

He did decide to pass on housing, if not only because he heard horror stories about older students living with freshmen away from home for the first time. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but most people do a *lot* of maturing that first year of college, which he\u2019s already done. \n\nWe had initially been looking at Allston and even Cambridge because most of the rents seem to be in our range out there. However, we live in suburban Houston, which is a world away from downtown Boston, and I think it will be quite an adjustment on its own without having to commute on the T. He also likes the practice in the middle of the night, which is more problematic if he has to get on public transportation. \n\nI fully anticipate that he\u2019ll live a little further away his second year, but he\u2019ll probably have a roommate to look with and he\u2019ll know his way around the city by then. Thanks for the suggestions, he\u2019ll probably check out those neighborhoods!",

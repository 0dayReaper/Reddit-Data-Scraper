I would definitely recommend keeping your grades up, as I\u2019m sure if you are planning on applying to other schools they will come in handy. But Berklee is a test optional school, and as long as you have about a 3.0 you should be fine. The audition is really what makes or breaks you when applying to the school.",

I know for a fact they still care about grades, they want to know you\u2019re a hard worker and will keep up with your classes. Just keep your grades up, don\u2019t go way out of your way to get A+\u2019s, it\u2019s not about that... I\u2019d say you should get your reading and theory chops up if they aren\u2019t yet so you have as much of an advantage as you can have when you get to Berklee. Good luck and dm me if you ever have any questions!",

    "postText": "Hi everyone,\nI'm going to audition for Berklee this summer. My prepared piece is a classical guitar piece and I am afraid that the sound would be a little messy on a video call and that it would mess up with the dynamics and characteristics of the sound of the instrument. It's a bit difficult for me to go to a in person audition as this summer they are only doing auditions either in Boston or online and I live in Europe. Does anyone know if the online audition could affect my chances of getting a scholarship?\n\nThank you so much!",

            "comment": "Hi - my daughter auditioned online (from the UK) to study percussion. She prepared pieces on marimba, snare drum and timpani (can\u2019t remember if she had time for all three). The sound was terrible but she got a place and decent scholarship. They are completely used to adjusting for online auditions and remember the interview and demonstrating commitment is a huge part of getting a place as well. Good luck!",

    "postText": "Hey everyone - I just found out that I got into the Masters of Songwriting program through Berklee Online. Curious on thoughts on the program, if it's competitive, or if anyone has gone through it. It seems like the curriculum is focused on not just songwriting but navigating the business of it and actually turning it into a profession. I feel like that's what I need, as I have a decent amount of songwriting experience but have been buffering on how to actually transform that into a career. I'm in nyc so hoping that I could still meet some people in person even though the actual classes are online.",

Since the classes are smaller, it's been easy to get to know people and in my experience, the professors have been attentive and quick to respond to emails. It has been relevant to my career so far, but that likely depends on what you're looking to do. It's also definitely a situation where you get out what you put in. Feel free to DM me!",

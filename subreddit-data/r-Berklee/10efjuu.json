When I was accepted to Berklee, it actually didn\u2019t come until a few days after that (and with a good scholarship to boot.)\n\nDon\u2019t listen to people who say it\u2019s bad news \u2013 I don\u2019t think they know what they\u2019re talking about.",

I made my interview about mental health, how it affected me, and how my presence will help them. Admissions guy seemed to really dig it and the reason i wasn't to go there is to truly make a difference because it's so personal to me.",

The part that\u2019s binding is the deposit you pay along with that. It\u2019s not like they\u2019ll kick you out of the school for reneging on your housing decision. You\u2019ll just be out a few thousand dollars. \n\nI\u2019m sure you can ask to be put on some sort of risk free waitlist so other students who have made their housing decision can get a dorm, then if somebody drops out or changes their mind, a spot will open up.",

    "postText": "Hey! It\u2019s me again. I\u2019m taking my first songwriting course, and I\u2019m really struggling with the aspect of transcribing melody from my head to the page. I can write random notes, play them, and see what sounds good, but I cannot for the life of me figure out the notes in my head. ET is probably my worst subject, but I am working really hard (passed w a B). Any advice on how to approach this? I love songwriting, and I want to do well in this class. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Hi! If you can SING a melody you can transcribe it. It\u2019s a skill that gets easier with practice. Don\u2019t worry! \n\nSing it out loud first, get precise. Then Isolate the first pitch, hold the pitch, then find it on the keyboard. Go note by note like that. I\u2019m not kidding I\u2019ll listen to the same 1 second blip of a record I\u2019m transcribing on repeat until I can match the pitch precisely. Can record yourself and use an app like amazing slow downer if you want. If you can find the pitch with your voice and be sure about it, you can then match it to the keyboard.\n\nYou got this!",

            "comment": "Identifying chord tones is a good framework to work on every day. Tendency tones seem to help people out as well! Sometimes it can be hard when a melody you\u2019re thinking of starts somewhere other than a chord tone, maybe the progression you hear doesn\u2019t even start on the tonic. But if you can get to a piano and find some landmarks it will point you in the right direction! \n\nI still read through my ET books every now and then as a 6th semester student. That stuff was incredibly hard for me when I got here but has been the most beneficial! Good luck!!",

But if you\u2019re at Berklee and writing, I\u2019m guessing you already do what you do very well. So congrats for putting the creative part first and adding the scholarly side later!",

You could export the midi out of melodyne, then import that onto any instrument track in your daw, and edit from there. \n\nAlso if you're a guitar player, and you use the app Guitar Pro, you could download the guitar tabs for any song, export the midi from there, import that into your daw and edit from there. Perfect for doing covers since all the songs are already transcribed in midi format.",

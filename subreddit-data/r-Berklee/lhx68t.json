    "postText": "Can anyone who has already auditioned help me out? I'm a vocalist preparing for the ear training portion of my audition. I have two questions. \n\n1. Are intervals a part of the ear training portion? If so what form are they presented in? I am memorizing them in their ascending form. Do I also need to know block and descending?\n2. For the chord qualities portion, how are the chords presented. Do I need to be able to recognize them as both individual notes and triads played together?\n\nThanks in advance!",

I\u2019m a classical pianist, so that was very confusing for me, although there were a VERY easy stuff for me at that time (I have studied solfege from 5 yo). What can I say, must\u2019ve been practicing on that!",

It started with intervals, then they asked me to name chords: simple, with extensions, and with alterations.\n\nAs I can judge, they were impressed when I identified Dominant 7th chord with flat 13th (or natural, I don\u2019t really remember). But maybe it is because of my classical background. Also, I think that because of that, they didn\u2019t tell me to improvise over blues, just said like \u201cWell, now we improvise. Can you do something?\u201d. Haha, I think they are desperate about classical musicians, so they don\u2019t expect much from them.\n\nBut I get their point. It is essential to have a good ear, not only in pitch and rhythm, but in timbral sense as well \u2014 that\u2019s why they play ear training on different instruments, or they even can sing them, as I know.",

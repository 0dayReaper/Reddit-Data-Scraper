    "postText": "So hey this is my second application to berklee on the saxophone. I didn't get in the first time :(\n\nI totally failed ear training the first time so I worked really hard on ear training before my second application last November. They also cut me off in my first audition in the middle of my sax solo. This didnt happen on my second audition and i finished my solo. fingers crossed!!!!!!!\n\nI heard that a lot of people who auditioned in november have already been sent acceptances. is it a bad sign that I havent received mine yet? should I be expecting another rejection at the end of march?\n\nim rly sorry about this i'm just so nervous!",

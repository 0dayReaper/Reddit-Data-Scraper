Also, if you Google 'berklee ap credits' you should be able to find a chart with a list of credits you can earn and the minimum AP exam scores needed. If it helps: I got iirc a 4 in AP stats and a 5 in AP psych, which got me the credits here at Berklee\u2014as you may already know, you only need ONE math or science course credits fulfilled for most degrees. Since I'm a Music Ed major with AP stats credit, my math/science liberal arts credits are already fulfilled.",

By auditioning for berklee you're automatically applying for a scholarship, which can range from nothing all the way to a full ride. There are others you can apply for once you're in the program, but they don't pay as much",

And what makes the scholarship people pay me money, do they keep some tests or something on which the money quantity would depend on.\nWhat bout part time jobs, can a student get a part time job in the campus??\nThanks for your reply bro...",

Maybe you could double major in songwriting and contemporary writing and production? \n\nYou don't have to pay for a Mac all four years, Berklee recommends that you buy a new Mac to enroll, but you don't \\*need\\* it. I do highly recommend that you buy a Mac for college, especially if you're going into music. An M1 Mac Mini, which is $699 brand new from [apple.com](https://apple.com) provides plenty of processing power for music production, though it is a desktop computer and you couldn't take it to class. A $1299 MacBook Pro will easily last you 8-10 years depending on your use case. (I don't work for Apple I swear, I just love their computers lol)\n\nYour scholarship hinges on your GPA for the most part. I believe you have to maintain above a 2.0 and stay full time to keep your full scholarship.

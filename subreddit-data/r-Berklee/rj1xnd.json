Thanks a lot for the advice though, especially about harmony and arranging, I'll definitely do that\n\n I don't think I can afford the gap year lol but I'll try grinding as much as I can before my first semester. Not really a jazzer so I'll mostly just learn a bunch of music and work on my improv and stuff",

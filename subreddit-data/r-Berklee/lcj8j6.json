    "postText": "Hi guys! I am  looking to transfer to Berklee. I am really interested in joining Berklee's music business/performance major. However, as I am mostly classically trained with limited experience in singing in contemporary style (I usually explore contemporary singing on my own without any coaching), would that put me at an \"disadvantaged\" position because I don't necessarily fit in the contemporary style?",

            "comment": "Hi! I would encourage you to audition with a classical piece that you know very well rather than a contemporary piece that you don\u2019t. I am a horn player and I got accepted with a Mozart horn concerto. Once you start at Berklee you\u2019ll learn how to adapt and play different genres easier but what they look for in the interview is passion and desire to learn. It\u2019s most important to play what you know and be honest about what you don\u2019t.",

            "comment": "HEEY BRO! I am also a Business Management/ Music Therapy major student and entered Berklee as a classically trained pianist. It absolutely DOES NOT put you at a disadvantage at all instead it would actually help you out a lot more than you think. I would say audition with your best piece that is short but could also represent you! Feel free to cut it short as well if you think your longer pieces have a better shot. However, if you do cut it short, make sure you inform you judges about it so they know where you are playing from and where you are ending! Being a classical pianist will also help you identify the notes from a leadsheet a lot faster and give you the techniques to adapting too playing playing jazz licks much faster too! However, you still gotta practice. Feel free to hmu and would love to help answer your questions and concerns!",

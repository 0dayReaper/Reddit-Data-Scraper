If teachers have been a problem for you there\u2019s always another teacher at berklee you can try. The teachers at berklee are one of the main reasons I\u2019m going and in my opinion is one of the schools best assets.",

            "comment": "Honestly, it really depends on what groups you choose to hang out with. While Berklee\u2019s students aren\u2019t necessarily cruel, it is a very competitive school and your work will be critiqued many times by students and professors alike and believe me, learning not to take their criticism personally is a hard thing to do, but it can be done. Though I may be biassed because I\u2019m a songwriting major, from my experience, the songwriting students and professors have been the nicest. If you do decide to start attending at Berklee, we\u2019d be very lucky to have you. Please feel free to DM me if you want to know more about the environment here.",

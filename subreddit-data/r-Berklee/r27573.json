    "postText": "Hi, I'm applying for Berklee soon and I would love to know what can I put in the composition and supplemental materials section of my application. Also, under the Composition Materials section, it is written \"Applicants wishing to have their materials reviewed must submit notational scores of at least two recent works. Scores must be legibly notated (by hand or by computer).\". I would have to send sheet notes from 2 of my works? Sorry about all those questions, English is not my first language and I'm pretty confused about certain stuff.",

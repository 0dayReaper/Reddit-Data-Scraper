I'm a Desktop guy so no Garageband for me \ud83d\ude01 I like composing soundtracks and thematic pieces like Hans Zimmer, Ennio Morricone and Two Steps from hell. These guys are my inspiration all day long. Besides that, I've also experienced quite a bit with EDM and other kinds of dance music. I would love to learn how to make the most out of my projects. If you can, (shameless self-promotion incoming) have a listen to my pieces on YT. Just search \"TC Pargax\", cheers\ud83e\udd42",

But I also really enjoy school, and so I am considering the education side of things for that reason. And that is super cool!! I really enjoy the works of all of those composers, particularly Silvestri (the Polar Express soundtrack has a special place in my heart). Excellent role models to have on all counts for sure.",

It's always those electronic/ambiental and atonal pieces that create the best environments. I really liked them. Good job! \n\nAs for me, I compose more melodic pieces and I like arranging and orchestrating compositions for video supports. I love original soundtracks a lot. Here's my YT channel if you're curious :) I'd love to colab with you once we get there. https://youtube.com/channel/UCGKek29CZfblqrYp47k-hiA",

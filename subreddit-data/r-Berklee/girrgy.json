It\u2019s just a matter of being able to get one which can be tough, but if you commit to it for long enough and keep getting to the sign up page right when studio slots are released you\u2019ll get a spot eventually.",

MP&amp;E students are at the front of the line for their projects. You can't just book out a studio randomly as a songwriting major and go jam out in there and roll around in piles of equipment.\n\nBut like I said, maybe they've changed things. There are smaller rigs that you can indeed get in on far easier, but even for those, often it's a class that you've taken that unlocks access to them, etc. And those classes aren't open to all majors, etc.",

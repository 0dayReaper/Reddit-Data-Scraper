I haven\u2019t graduated high school yet, but I want to know what I should have prepared to ensure getting in. I can read music and play a bit of piano. Is there anything else I should start working on that\u2019ll help me get in? Also, what are the auditions like, and what are the expectations?",

            "comment": "People on reddit like to say that online degrees and especially online music degrees are stupid and not worth it, but I am a currently wrapping up the electronic music production degree and I have had a blast. I have learned more in a year or so than the last 7 years. A close friend of mine attended both in person Berklee and then Berklee online and she said that she preferred the online portal. \n\nThe audition for the online seemed to me to be more like a  confirmation that you know what music is and can pickup an instrument vs. in person where I assume you have to be proficient to a degree. Make sure your essay and references are there of course. \n\nI do have to say I am receiving help via the VA for the tuition, but even that aside its still cheaper than a majority of programs and on top of that, now you actually receive a genuine bachelor's of arts. Also, the references and materials that are linked to in class will take you down all sorts of learning that you wouldn't have found on your own. Its great. \n\nAnd lastly, the thing missing from online learning/music making is the in person networking. But, now you get to network with people across the globe, and as you will see, a lot of classmates end up living in your area, so its honestly what you make of it.",

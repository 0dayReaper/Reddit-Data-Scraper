            "comment": "I\u2019m not a student yet (will start in May), but I did do the Aspire program. I cant say that it\u2019s the same, but the program was  actually designed to give you a taste of what to expect at Berklee - so I can only share my experiences from that at least.\n\nThere will be ensembles, your core classes, private lessons, etc. You will most likely have a lot on your plate so come in expecting that, but don\u2019t feel overwhelmed. It\u2019s super fun! Time management is key and you have to learn how to be responsible with your time. One thing my currently enrolled Berklee friends taught me was that it\u2019s all about networking and making friends. This doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t strive to do good in  your classes. It just means you should spend time making friends and learning from them more often and balance your time. Get close with your professors, classmates, and all the pros you meet there. In the end, it\u2019s the relationship you build that will make you successful and land you that job or internship in the future.\n\nAs far as I know, you need to focus on finding the major you like and work towards entering in. Your major is undecided for the first few semesters and I heard there will be a test/audition you would need to do in order to claim that major.\n\nFocus on your core classes (theory, harmony, ear training, etc) as well as your liberal arts stuff you might be taking. Don\u2019t know how the ensembles work, but join them and join other bands too. Be involved as much as possible. Use your time wisely and practice by yourself or with your band mates as much as you can. Stay on top of your homework, that\u2019s also practice. \n\nIn terms of staying healthy: based on my experience last summer, lots of kids stayed up doing whatever. Most practiced, others chilled or went to events. There will be so much going on when you\u2019re there. You decide how much of it you can handle. If you want my opinion, stay up when you need to, but don\u2019t forget your regular sleep. Sleep is so important and if you don\u2019t stay consistent with your regular sleep schedule, it can affect your stress hormones and cause you to struggle in your day to day activities. Sleep well and you will function well.\n\nAlso, avoid late night eating. Most jam sessions might be late in the night and you and your friends might go out and grab a bite to eat. Don\u2019t do it. Eating late night will disrupt your metabolism and slower digestion, essentially causing weight gain, etc. Instead try to eat healthy. Don\u2019t go to 7-11 across the street, Shahs, or McDonald\u2019s if those are your only options at night. Eat a well balanced, nutritious meal. Don\u2019t be tempted by the junk at the caf. Always eat healthy so you can feel more energized and perform your best. \n\nAfter a few semesters, you\u2019ll slowly want to find a job at campus. There are tons of things you could do like work at the admissions office, housing office, or become a stage manager to name a few. It\u2019ll be hard to land these jobs, but that\u2019s where your friends come in. They can help!\n\nBe acquainted with everybody, but have your own close circle of friends, too. Everyone you meet is an opportunity to collab or do something professional with. You meet a guitarist? You have a guitarist for your next project or band. You make friends with a music production and engineering major? You now have studio access and can record your band.\n\nSo to summarize:\n\n- Focus on your class work and activities and try to be involved as much as possible without draining yourself\n- Networking is important. Make friends and acquaintances as much as you can because they are all *opportunities* for you. It\u2019s your connections that land you your job in the future! You are paying Berklee for your connections mostly.\n- Stick to a regular sleep schedule (don\u2019t let your day to day activities disrupt it) because you\u2019ll end up being stressed and struggle to complete your daily activities.\n- Eat well and avoid junk food, especially late at night. There will be times you\u2019ll want to eat after a jam session - so try to opt for healthy food that replenishes your lost energy. Avoid greasy and sugary foods - they\u2019ll make you crash and affect other things without you knowing. \n- It\u2019s worth adding that you should also make time for the gym even after a hectic day of walking and staying active. Gym will not only teach you discipline, but also prevent you from becoming stressed with your hectic schedule. Your body is a temple and your image is also important in the music scene so take care of it for your own health.\n- Never be overwhelmed. You\u2019ll have days where you want to give up and drop out. Stick through it. \n- Focus on your own future goals and career. Let Berklee be a hub for your work and a place where you can make mistakes and learn from them. Use Berklee as your audience and your guidance. Your professors and mates can help you with so many things!",

            "comment": "I came to Berklee as a classical singer. I did choir and orchestra at school, but I didn\u2019t stick with either. Most of my musical experience was through songwriting. I spent most of the pandemic meeting co-writers, and writing songs. You have to spend a lot of time on classes at Berklee. The maximum amount of credits is 16, and a lot of private lessons, and ensembles are only one credit. The amount of time these classes take are not equal to the credit that they hold. A lot of your time will also be spent working through core music. There are some people who are very strong in this area, but a lot of people can struggle to pass these classes. Everyone has to do for semesters of ensembles. Most ensembles are two hours a week at one time, but a lot of them require outside prep. Choosing a major is really hard, but there are resources to help you. I would suggest talking to current students, faculty, and taking intra-classes. As for staying healthy, you have to realize that your physical and mental health comes first. Honestly, this is a struggle for everybody. Make sure that you\u2019re reaching out and asking for help. You need to eat healthy food, exercise, and get enough sleep. This isn\u2019t always easy, but you can do it. I enjoy meeting other songwriters, but I also love my job as an ESL tutor. I get to meet people from so many different countries. Also, music therapy majors are amazing people!",

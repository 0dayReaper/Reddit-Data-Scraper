I just think back to what I actually learned in classes vs what I learned by networking with students and it makes me sad to think about the students who are gonna miss out on that. Good luck though.",

I think if you go into it with positivity and eagerness to learn about musical fundamentals/advanced shit you will find a lot of value. I\u2019d recommend really getting to know some professors that stand out to you (even while doing so remotely). They can be beneficial / provide guidance especially if you\u2019re looking to go above and beyond in certain areas of your musicianship.",

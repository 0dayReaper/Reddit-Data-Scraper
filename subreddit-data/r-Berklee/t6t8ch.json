    "postText": "Just finished my audition today on electric guitar. Started off by asking me what guitarists I was into. Told them I\u2019d been getting into fusion players like frank Gambale and Shawn Lane, but that their stuff was really advanced and kind of over my head. The guy replied \u201cwell it\u2019s over our heads too\u201d thought that was funny. I started with my prepared piece- an Andy Timmons song ~5 and a half minutes in length. It seemed to go well but the timing might have been slightly off at some parts. I think I hit every note except a few faster licks at the end. Hopefully they will cut me some slack because I had to memorize 5 and a half minutes worth of material. Next was chords. He asked me to play two voicings of each chord: maj7, min7, dominant 7. The only chord I didn\u2019t get was a second voicing of dominant 7 because I forgot the fingering. Next he asked me to play a g major scale. And then play the same scale but starting with a different finger on the root. I did this but didn\u2019t end on the root, I ended with my first finger on the 7 which technically made it a Locrian mode instead of G major, even though this mode is contained in the g major scale. I told him I was aware of this. Next we did some improv, just an A minor funk/fusion backing track from the berklee website. I like to think that I\u2019m pretty good at improvising but I actually have no idea. After the improv the guy just nodded and said \u201cJammin\u2019 out in A minor\u201d. Then he played some phrases on piano that I had to sing back. It seemed like I got most of them until he started doing wider intervals. There were probably like 9 or 10 phrases. Next we did rhythmic call and response with clapping. I think I got most of them, probably 7 out of 9 or something. Next was the sight reading. I made my way through the first two exercises with a few mistakes. I barely got through the third one. I told them I\u2019d only been reading for two months. Not really sure. Does this sound like a bad audition? I think it could go either way.",

If u had no room to learn, u wouldn't be going to school and looking to further your education. And remember there is also the interview and transcripts and anything else you sent in to help your chances. I think you'll did just fine. Congrats on surviving the process!",

            "comment": "Yeah I guess I am just tying too much of my self worth to it. Being a musician is the only thing I\u2019ve ever wanted out of life, and I\u2019ve pretty much failed in every other aspect of life. If I get rejected I might start to question how good I actually am. I might even consider giving it up. I\u2019ve put hours into this for several years. To get rejected would feel like it was all a waste. If I\u2019m not even good enough at the age of 25 to be a freshman at berklee, then how will I ever make it in the real world of music? Gah I\u2019m just feeling really down right now.",

There\u2019s so many other schools and so, so many musicians who have made music their life without a music degree. You can do anything you put your mind to.\n\nI\u2019m 29 and I got into Berklee to attend this May only to realize I simply cannot afford to go there even with the half off tuition scholarship they offered me. The student loans would put me in so much debt that it\u2019s just not feasible for me. My world has been completely turned upside down but I am figuring out another way to change my career path. \n\nI wish you the best of luck. Never stop believing in yourself.",

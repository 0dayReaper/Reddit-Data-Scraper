            "comment": "&gt;So I was wondering is it worth it to go into a dorm or live off campus?\n\nyeah all of my friends are people I lived with and we still call each other the 270 gang 2 years later. youre probably gonna want to live on campus unless youre a social butterfly and have zero anxiety about not making friends.\n\n&gt;What are the breaks at berklee and how many semesters are there per year?\n\nsame as every other school, fall, winter, spring, full summer break; and 2 fall and spring semester.\n\n&gt;Do you have to take classes during the summer?\n\nwinter and spring semesters are optional. summer classes are 12 weeks, which is 4 weeks shorter than the fall and spring, so i took one to get some gen eds out of the way. \n\n&gt;How difficult is it to get accepted for different majors in berklee once you are in the school and where can I find the requirements for each one? All help is welcome.\n\nDepends on the major. Music Therapy and EPD are the hardest due to their lack of resources and space; Music Business is the easiest since you just need to declare and have a 2.0 GPA. Ive only heard about music therapy and EPD people complaining about how hard it is to get into their major, so if youre gonna major in anything else I wouldnt worry. I'm a performance major, and I was absolute shit when I auditioned and got in. And I'm not being humble, I mean that. They'll take you if they see you have potential (and they have the space). \n\nhttps://college.berklee.edu/majors\n\nrequirements should be on the first page of every major. except performance, they have different requirements for each instrument.",

Are my chances ruined?!My school offers a guitar class , but without sounding cocky, they are at a beginner  level and feel like I'm wasting my time so I've dropped them whenever they've been assigned . Any tips or suggestions. Thanks",

My daughter took a program last summer at Berklee and got to know the Director of the department where she will be taking her undergraduate degree. It's a great thing to do.",

Honestly, I think you can get places just by being self taught too. What interests you about Berklee? Production? Maybe do some self study. Also, if you\u2019re interested in being a music major at all I would definitely recommend taking private guitar lessons. You can consider this an extracurricular.",

There's also instrument-specific things to prepare. For example, as a piano principal, I had to prepare some scales. There's also the interview. I wrote a blog post about my experience [here](http://www.clarachanmusic.com/s/stories)\n\nAfter you get in, then you can declare your major(s). Or interview for them if you need to.\n\nGood luck and let me know if you have any more questions!",

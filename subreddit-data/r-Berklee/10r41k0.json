    "postText": "So I applied EA in October and had my audition on Dec 4th and I still haven't received any kind of notification for my decision. \n\nI emailed them just now asking when I'll receive the decision and the associate director of admissions said \"The Board of Admissions will meet next week to review your application and will notify you within 2 weeks with your decisions, we apologize for the delay.\"\n\nLike what is the point of applying early? I should be getting my decision by the 31st. I know people who auditioned 2 days after me and got their decision within a week. Is there any kind of schedule they follow when releasing decisions or is it just completely random? Did they forget about my application? Anyone else in a similar situation? Should I be worried? Fuck this is stressful.",

Focus on preparing your instrumental skills (playing, reading, improvising, different styles) and your interview questions. There\u2019s a whole page on Berklee\u2019s website that gives you example questions\u2014my interviewer asked me them verbatim. Good luck!",

A good friend of mine got in with a 2.0, but also nailed his guitar levels the day he arrived with all 7\u2019s.\n\nWith Roger Brown things have gotten more strict, but I still think Berklee cares about you as a musician over a GPA. Why? Because the industry is a cruel place and only cares about results of your playing and little else",

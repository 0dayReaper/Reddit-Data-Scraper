Absolutely don't worry because they will most definitely ask you about your musical background and some of your achievements and proud moments.   \n2) i do not know approximately your skill for piano but I did classical piano for a long time and the sight reading was the easiest of it all. Chords and interval was not that hard. I personally felt the improvisation was the hardest as I've never had any training on it, but that would not be a factor for cutting you out of the process as there are plenty of people who does not know how to improvise so if you have no idea what you are doing. Feel free to say you do not know how to improvise. They would most likely ask you to try just reading the chord and if you can do that then feel free to do so!   \nI do not know how your virtual audition will go but I would suggest just have really good wifi and no background noises! Good Luck on your audition! Feel free to hmu if you got any more questions!",

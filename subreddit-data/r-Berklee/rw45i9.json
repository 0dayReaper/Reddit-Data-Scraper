They just updated the 2nd one but the first one is still not \"received\". Does anyone know what's going on? Should I just wait for the portal to get updated for a few days?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/48hn235dfq981.png?width=2818&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=44774e1f1cc111a96c0245697deb7bb2daf73bad",

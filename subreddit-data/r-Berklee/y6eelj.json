    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019ve been working on my application and I\u2019m not sure which major to go with. The tour mentioned that you\u2019d be undeclared for the first year no matter what and then you decide. They also mentioned minimum gpa requirements for some of the majors. \n\nI really want to get into MPE but the minimum is a 3.7 gpa which is way higher than mine. I want to audition with my guitar so I was thinking maybe songwriting but I still want to learn production at berklee. \n\nMy high school gpa was a 1.8, it was rough to say the least. First year of community college has been going good with straight As and Bs. Currently trying to boost my gpa\n\nWhat would you guys do if you were in my position?",

I don't really know the GPA requirement (I'm not an MPE major), but I heard that the selection is very competitive so I'm not surprised if the minimum is 3.7.\n\nIf you can maintain your grades here like you are doing right now at community college and you have demonstrated whatever criteria they are looking for, then I would say you have a chance, but I'm not an MPE major so I could be wrong.  Also, only the number of credits will transfer not the letter grade.\n\nIf you decided to do the Songwriting major but you still want to learn production, then I suggest doing a minor in Recording and Productions for Musicians.  Its pretty much MPE but as a minor instead of a major.  You can also double major Songwriting and MPE, but I believe that takes 5 years instead of 4 years to complete.  Another option instead of Songwriting or MPE is Independent Recording and Production major.  It is a very new major they just released this Fall 2022 and it seems pretty similar to MPE.  There is also no requirements to this major.\n\nRecord and Productions for Musicians minor - [https://college.berklee.edu/minors/recording-and-production-musicians](https://college.berklee.edu/minors/recording-and-production-musicians)\n\nIndependent Recording and Production major - [https://college.berklee.edu/mpe/bachelor-of-music-in-independent-recording-and-production](https://college.berklee.edu/mpe/bachelor-of-music-in-independent-recording-and-production)",

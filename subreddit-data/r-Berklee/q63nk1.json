Looking back at it now, my musicianship (piano) was pretty atrocious.\n\nWhen I auditioned to be transferred I had around a 3.4 to 3.6 GPA and I got accepted.  I think your grades does matter but doesn't weigh that much compared to your audition and interview.  When I transferred, I noticed that the workload at Berklee was a lot compared to my previous college.  I'm confident that if I was somehow accepted the first time, I would have fallen behind on a lot of courses, maybe even failed some.  I think, if you haven't already, maintain at least around a 3.0 GPA every semester in high school or when you get here.  While your gpa won't matter that much in your admissions it will matter when it comes to scholarship (not from the audition) and for applying to certain majors.",

I was accepted with a full tuition scholarship but I am looking if I can have some financial help to live in the dorms, because it is pricey and I come from another country! Does anybody know if there is a scholarship you can have for housing and meal plans",

Don\u2019t bet at all to get more until you\u2019re 4+ semesters in. I ended up dropping out and switching to online (not AT ALL like in-person) after 3 semesters because I literally couldn\u2019t take on more debt. I\u2019m very thankful - in a way - that my hands were tied like that.",

I don't know if there is a renewing of scholarship process after 4th semester (the school should be in contact with you about that once school starts). You will also be put into \"on-call\" musician for recording sessions after your ensemble ratings (usually you'll get assigned after you get a 3 or 4+ rating).",

I just played well in my audition, had a good transcript, and didnt read any music in my audition (improvised and head/jazz) I got an email about it after, you should contact the scholarship office. Idk how its done these days though",

            "comment": "They don\u2019t really care what your intended major is when you audition. That\u2019s an interview question. Play something you play well or that means a lot to you. Play something comfortable. Not to say it shouldn\u2019t be impressive, but you should play something you know so inside and out that you couldn\u2019t screw up if you tried. Don\u2019t try and guess what the admissions panel will want to hear. Play what you want and what you care about and your passion will shine through.  \n  \nI auditioned with a self-arranged piece from a video game and my major only had a little to do with arranging skills. My intended major had nothing to do with arranging skills. Neither have anything to do with video game scoring.\n\n I\u2019ve known people who\u2019ve auditioned on every genre under the sun. Diversity and authenticity is a plus over all else.",

You probably won\u2019t be comfortable enough with the material. Pick something you already know.  \n  \nEdit: also chromaticism is kinda counter to most classical styles and techniques. If anything, most classical music is built specifically to avoid chromaticism. If you want to show of your comfortability with approach notes and/or complex theory and/or dissonance, your best bet is to pick a jazz tune. Maybe more modern composers will have what you\u2019re looking for sonically, but I struggle to think of any pieces of the top of my head that would meet all the criteria.",

I agree with the others on this thread - you'd want something you're super comfortable with. Since you only have a month, I would recommend you dig up repertoire you've already learned, and continue to refine it. I think it's too late to learn a new piece (unless you're a super fast learner). \n\nAlso, make sure you know your scales - they will be asking for any major scale in two octaves. Brush up on your sight reading, improv and ear training. Feel free to contact me [here](https://www.mastermusic.online) if you have any questions!\n\nBest of luck!",

Either way, commit to a piece that you feel good about that shows your skills off well. They\u2019re looking for potential, not perfection, so definitely bring something that makes you feel confident :)",

The hardest part is getting a scholarship. \n\nThe goal is to show off your skills as best as you can and let them know you\u2019re comfortable with what you\u2019re doing and that you know your way around things. Performance is key. Do you have any experience performing live, perhaps in a gig or for a crowd? If not, it\u2019s ok. My point is, has there been anything you\u2019ve ever played for a crowd that got a really good reaction from people? Perhaps that could be a step in the right direction. If you have any tricks on the piano, make sure to include that.\n\nknowing how to sight read and being able to identify chords, scales, etc can also get you far, but it seems like you\u2019ll be fine here. You don\u2019t really need to know music theory to enter. They decide what level theory classes you need once you get in.",

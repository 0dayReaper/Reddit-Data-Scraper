    "postText": "I play electric guitar and I would like to audition with kind of a mash up of pieces of various songs I\u2019ve learned that all together would be about 3 minutes. Do you think it would be acceptable for me to audition with this type of structure instead of just a whole 4 minute song?",

What kind of performance?\n\nAre you just playing and they judge your skill?  Will you play a few songs with the band?\n\nIn my experience as a rock guitarist, every audition has been playing with the band.\n\nI\u2019ve also found that while your proficiency matters, attention to details of the band matter more.  Did you get guidance on gear?  Did they ask you to learn any songs?  How do you plan to approach your tone and volume in the mix?  How do you plan to approach your interactions and introductions to the other members?\n\ndid you bring an extension cord for all your power?\n\nDo you have a backup guitar in case you break a string.  If not, do you know how to quickly change a string and stretch it so it will stay in tune?\n\ndo you have a tuner and a backup tuner?\n\n\nLots more i\u2019d want to know before attempting to judge whether your idea is a good one\u2026 you could simply kill your performance and guys look at each other with wtf looks.  Or it could be perfect.  Inquiring mind wants to know!",

I\u2019ll just be auditioning online in my room and I\u2019ll be doing it by myself with no band. I play RnB and Jazz. I\u2019m just going to play my audition piece and then they move on to the improv and technical section and etc.",

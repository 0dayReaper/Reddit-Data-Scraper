I've recently put together a completely free, no strings attached, four hour audio / video course all about my experience licensing my music and working with other musicians helping them get their music licensed.\n\nCheck it out if you're interested here:  \n[https://www.htlympremium.com/free-course.html](https://www.htlympremium.com/free-course.html)",

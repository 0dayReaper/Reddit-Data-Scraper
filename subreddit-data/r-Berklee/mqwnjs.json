Those who are identified as full-tuition scholarship candidates based on musical merit will be invited to submit a federal financial aid form. Those that demonstrate need will be considered for a Presidential Scholarship.\"\n\nThat's just what I saw on this website:\n\nhttps://college.berklee.edu/news/311/presidential-scholarships-awarded",

CWP is more open ended with optional scoring classes. I\u2019ve been able to use skills learned from CWP to write for short films and games but my focus is always on just producing the best music I can muster whether it\u2019s for myself, my band, a game whatever...CWP prepares you to just say yes. Check out the book \u2018writer, producer, engineer by CWP prof Michael Farquharson. It\u2019s short and really captures the essence of the major.",

Wish I could say more about it but there wasn\u2019t much overlap outside of some elective courses. CWP is broad. Very broad. You\u2019ll learn traditional jazz arranging techniques as well as electronic, orchestral, pop, a capella...and you\u2019ll be expected to produce a good recording of each major arrangement so your portfolio ends up being much more commercially focused.",

In regards to electives, it was pretty amazing how many styles/techniques were covered. Name it and they probably provide something for it. I tended to tack on composition/writing electives since it helped me generate material for my arranging and production classes instead of spreading myself too thin with something unrelated.",

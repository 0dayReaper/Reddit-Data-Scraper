            "comment": "My take on this is this. I come to berklee as a bad student who barley made it through high school but i had very good proficiency and understanding of harmony in a musical way not a theoretical one so i came to berklee barley reading treble clef. They didn\u2019t offer me a scholarship at first which made it impossible for me to attend but after gathering money and applying for 3rd party grants i made ends meet and i worked my ass of to proof my value to the school and after two semesters i a got a scholarship enough for me to finish my degree. So all i can say is that you\u2019re young and you have 5 years to prepare yourself so make sure you become an overachiever and do everything you can to actually stand out its all about what kinda of value you can add and how big is your potential just don\u2019t quit my guy no matter how difficult it might feel sometimes keep working hard and don\u2019t stop no matter what. Happy new year :)",

Practice,  practice,  practice.  Berklee is a music school with emphasis on your musical abilities. The audition is super important so go on YouTube and research every video about auditioning at Berklee. Maintain a C or B average in high school. But definitely take music in middle school and high school.  Join the music band and learn all things music. You will be ready in 5 years. But, also when you are 15 you can go to Berklee for the 1 week or 2 week summer program. Save a year in advance.  This will get you familiar with the school and professors. My daughter did this and she loved it! Her instrument is voice because she is a singer/songwriter. She's now a student there. Ok. Get started on your musical journey! All the best to you.",

    "postText": "Has anyone actually failed a proficiency exam? I\u2019m wondering what it takes to fail it. I can play most of the scales after a few tries, most of the chords and arpeggios but not all. My prepared piece I can play decently with a few mistakes but I\u2019m totally screwed for the reading. God I really don\u2019t want to have to repeat this year of PI\u2026",

I once got a C+ on my proficiency I still got a B+. This was because it was on zoom, and a lot of people were cheating about memorizing music. Unfortunately, I got caught. I do know a drummer who actually failed his proficiency, but he ended up passing private lessons. I\u2019m sure they will probably pass you. Sending good vibes!",

            "comment": "Yeah most of the scholarships Berklee gives out upon entering is based on how well you did for your audition. If you want berklee money for your production abilities you\u2019d have a much better chance at getting a scholarship from the department of your chosen major which you\u2019ll be eligible for at your 4th semester (at least, thats how it works for my major, which is songwriting)",

            "comment": "Yes, it\u2019s impossible. Entry and financial support from Berklee hinges on your ability to play an instrument (or voice) and academic track record. You aren\u2019t even able to declare production as your major within your first few semesters.  They want you to prove you can be a good student at Berklee before letting you into one of the most rigorous conservatory programs in the world. And, I don\u2019t mean to sound discouraging, but unless your dad is Rick Rubin or CLA and you\u2019ve been shadowing recording sessions in a professional facility for a few years before Berklee, your production skills won\u2019t be considered \u201cscholarship worthy\u201d. \n\nThink about it. You can come into college being a savant that\u2019s been playing piano since you were four and know your instrument as well as Berklee piano majors. However, I just don\u2019t see a scenario in which somebody\u2019s music production skills can be \u201ccompetitive\u201d coming out of high school. Remember, Berklee\u2019s production program is about MUCH more than making beats on your laptop! \n\nDo you have experience on a large format analog console? What about mic placement techniques and experience with all types of microphones? Have you ever overseen a full-scale production?  See what I mean? You can definitely have an edge by the time you get to Berklee, but nobody has that much of a head start when compared to performance/reading/arranging - skills that they DO give out scholarships for. \n\nMy advice would be\u2026. You are only 14. Shed your instrument HARD.   You can become an absolute beast at your instrument in only four years. If you start putting in four hours a day, everyday on your instrument, your skills will be scholarship worthy but the time you are ready to go to college.",

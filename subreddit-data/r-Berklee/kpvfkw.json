To my fellow lower middle class folks, how in the world are you paying for this education? and do you believe the price is worth it? I am trying everything in my power to be able to go to Berklee. It is quite a daunting task trying to figure out how to pay for it, though.",

Something else I would add as a senior is getting into scholarships which you can apply for and also doing elective courses at your hometown or wherever you live! Another way to safe a bit of money is to just apply for Diploma instead of Degree as you are literally going to learn the same material except you are not needing to take any elective courses (you can of course if credit allows, but that will be up to you and how you plan out your courses!)",

I take it you're not quite 24 yet, so I would recommend looking into either the Berklee student employment program if you qualify, as well as student loans in the meantime. \n\nAnother thing to note is that you don't have to spend every semester on campus- i was able to waive my first semester because of Covid, and have been off- campus since- I've saved almost $30k that way! Just remember that every $5,000 you borrow amounts to around $100 a month in loan payments, so keep that in mind as you plan it all out. Best of luck to you!!\n\n(Minor edit for clarification)",

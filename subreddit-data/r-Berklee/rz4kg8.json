I\u2019m a blues rock player but I play all types of genres so that song for me showcased my chops and feel the best. I got in and I intend to major in business as well as production and engineering. Good luck with everything!",

Berklee and money is an interesting relationship. You can also apply for scholarships separate from merit-based which I recommend doing for the long run",

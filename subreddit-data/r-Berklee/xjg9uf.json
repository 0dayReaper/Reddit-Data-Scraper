    "postText": "I took Berklee Keyboard Method this semester and it is biting me in the ass. I'm not doing well because  A. I'm not good at piano and B. I get anxiety when playing. Every week I have to record my assignments and it's just so stressful! My grades have been all over the place and I'm just so close to giving up! I wish this wasn't required. I feel like my teacher expects perfection and I can't give it to her.",

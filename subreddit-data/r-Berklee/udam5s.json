If you ever run into an issue expect a ton of support from the student body and your classmates but dont expect the school to take any real action past a slap on the wrist to the professor. Its mentioned by a previous commentor but i think most issues arise from a deadname/wrong pronouns on the application and official documents. But From what i can see and my personal experience from the 7 semesters ive been there is that the berklee community is dispaportionalty accepting of trans nonbinary and queer people compared to most places in the US.",

Half the trans students I know get habitually misgendered because of application and registration documents indicating a deadname and/or the wrong pronouns. So if you apply, if you can, make sure you make clear how you want to be identified. Getting the info changed in the registration system after having started classes is a nightmarish process.",

Unfortunately that\u2019s kind of a situation that you can only really deal with afaik after registration. So great school, very accepting, great community, but if you wanna do this, I\u2019d buckle down for some mindless arguing over email with some office drones are aren\u2019t competent enough to manage basic administrative systems.",

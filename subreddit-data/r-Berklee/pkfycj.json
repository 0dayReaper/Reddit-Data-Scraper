    "postText": "Hi all, I'm an MIT alum. Lived across some Berklee dorms and jammed with you guys back when I was in school. I'm looking to hire a student piano player to play jazzy music during the cocktail hour and reception of my upcoming wedding.\n\nI tried posting on the Berklee Career Manager, but it's been taking forever for the listing to be approved, so I thought I'd try here in the meantime! I didn't see any rules against this, so apologies if it's not welcome.\n\nThe gig will be from ~3:30-6 on Saturday Oct 2 in Waltham. Our budget is $300-600, and dinner will be provided. There is a baby grad onsite. Guests will be vaccinated or test negative within 24h. If you're interested, please send a PM.",

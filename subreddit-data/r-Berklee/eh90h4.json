I auditioned and got accepted last year with a 10K scholarship before I joined the military, so getting in wouldn\u2019t be a problem. \n\nI just want to know from any Berklee students if there are any veterans/active duty military students, and if they tend to do well overall compared to other students.",

            "comment": "I just finished my first semester at Berklee as a US Army veteran. I only knew 2 other US veterans. I got to know one of them pretty well, and we became friends, but I didn\u2019t see much of the other one. How well you do depends on how prepared you are and how hard you are willing to work. I worked really hard, but wasn\u2019t well-prepared musically, so I didn\u2019t do quite as well as I had hoped and I got a 3.5 GPA. \n\nThe biggest thing with Berklee is affordability. The GI Bill is great, but it only covers so much every year. My first semester was almost completely paid for because the GI Bill front-loaded its disbursement into the first semester, but I still had about $2,000 left over that I had to pay out of pocket, as well as all of the tuition, housing, and software deposits, which added up to almost $3,000.\n\nI will not be able to go back for my second semester. No one in my family was able to co-sign on private student loans, so I filed an appeal to get my scholarship raised from $10k to something that would allow me to stay. Despite all of the letters of recommendation I had and how hard I fought to get more aid, Berklee said they couldn\u2019t do anything for me.\n\nI\u2019d recommend trying it for a semester. You\u2019ll be able to get it mostly paid for minus some out of pocket costs. Even if you only get one semester out of it, I can tell you from experience that it will be worth it. If you have someone rich in your family, you can get them to help out and co-sign on private loans if needed as well.\n\nI will say, however, that if you come from a poor family like me, you might be SOL for the second semester unless you start applying for a shit-ton of outside scholarships right now. Also, the room and board is $18,000 a year, so you might also want to try getting an apartment with some roommates. That will save you some of your GI Bill money, but you will have to use your housing stipend.\n\nI loved Berklee, and I wish I could stay, but I can\u2019t afford it. I would go into too much debt for my family to handle with a degree that guarantees almost nothing. But I found something else. Musicians Institute in Los Angeles has unlimited Yellow Ribbon coverage, which means the school pays half of what isn\u2019t covered by the GI Bill and the VA pays the other half. On top of that, MI is half the price of Berklee to begin with. \n\nAgain, give Berklee a try, but don\u2019t be too disappointed if things don\u2019t work out. Remember that the goal is to be able to make a living in music. You don\u2019t necessarily need Berklee to do that. If Berklee doesn\u2019t work out, you have plenty of options, some of them are debt-free, which is something you should think about as a musician.",

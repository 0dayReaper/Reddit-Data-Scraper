I am struggling to get a separate loan but I\u2019ll fight through because I really want to be at Berklee. I am in the same situation as you though. \n\nFAFSA will help a bit, and then you\u2019d have to probably apply for a loan from a bank.",

My family has dealt with illness, bankruptcy, and foreclosure, and we somehow qualified for nothing/nada/zilch. We have been climbing out of our hole, which somehow puts us in the middle class, which then makes us unable to get aid. It's crazy. We are committed to going to Berklee, though other schools have been far more generous, and we have scoured the web looking for scholarships. It's not fun. Best of luck to everyone, many of us are in the same boat.",

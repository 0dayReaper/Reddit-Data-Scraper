    "postText": "I feel very hopeless about getting into berklee. I love music and am only now considering it as a career because all of my life I was told to do something more practical. This being said I have some music background from both choir and band prior to high school. I haven\u2019t taken band or anything in high school because I just wasn\u2019t thinking about a future in music. I would like to get in but I feel like I don\u2019t have enough music experience to even attempt applying I know very basic music theory, and can sight read at an ok level, however I never super specialized in an instrument I sing but I don\u2019t know that I do that well enough I could postpone my app for a year and take voice lessons but I\u2019m not sure if it would help. Any thoughts? \nPS.I don\u2019t want this to come of as complaining, whining, or pessimistic but these are my circumstances",

But if you do feel like you\u2019re underprepared, then I would suggest you taking lessons or something that could help like others have already said.\n\nJust know that you are going to Berklee to learn how to be a musician or become a better one. So if you don\u2019t know theory, i think it should be fine. \nDon\u2019t let the anxiety get to you like it did to me. I didn\u2019t apply until 10 years after high school because I felt I was underprepared. I literally applied last summer and got in. Although the anticipation for the audition was nerve wracking/intimidating, it ended up not being as bad as I thought.",

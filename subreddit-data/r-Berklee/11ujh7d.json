    "postText": "If a mediocre musician with a little bit of originality like me can get in, anyone can. Looking back and seeing what my ability was when I applied, I am amazed I got in, but I think I know why. I got in because I applied to start in the middle of the year, every other freshman\u2019s second semester. \n\nI see many of you applying to start in the fall as you would any school and your nervous about you being accepted. With half of the potential students being rejected I can see why, because everyone is applying to start then. But you need to remember people are always dropping out in the middle of the year for various reasons:\n\n1. They get homesick, miss their boyfriend/girlfriend, etc. like they would being at any school. \n\n2. They recognize music is not their true passion as they once thought. \n\n3. They are intimidated by the amount of great players there and feel they will never be good enough. \n\n4. They don\u2019t like the curriculum enough to spend the money. \n\n5. They feel that they have gotten enough from Berklee and don\u2019t really care if they get a degree or not. \n\n6. They can\u2019t take Boston\u2019s evil winter weather. ;) \n\nLet\u2019s face it, college is a business and they have holes to fill mid year. If you have the money and you are willing to start in January, I can almost guarantee it will be easier. \n\nApply to start Berklee then. If you want to, it would be a good idea to go to your local community college beforehand that previous fall semester and get some of your general education requirements out of the way. Besides being cheaper and easier, you don\u2019t have to be wasting your Berklee credits on classes that you can get anywhere.\n\nGood luck.",

I\u2019m a bit biased, but it\u2019s a great school. Let me know if you have any questions or need help with anything, I\u2019m a first year undergrad starting in May.",

I also applied for January and got accepted, but then they deferred me to May because there were not enough seats.\n\nI feel like Berklee is still a tiny bit selective though because a lot of my friends who play really well didn\u2019t get in. I don\u2019t know if they applied for Fall or another semester so maybe that also plays a role like you say. \n\nThe advice about studying with a community college or even Berklee online is a great way to stack up credits as long as you make sure those credits are transferable to Berklee campus.",

I have about 36 credits with them which i\u2019ve transferred. I\u2019ve taken majority of my first semester lib arts classes (according to my Grid) with Berklee Online so I don\u2019t have to take them at campus and instead focus on getting into my major and other things.",

If you\u2019re talking about core courses like ear training, you could take private lessons or practice on your own at home or wherever for dramatically cheaper and then test out. \n\nI think a huge part of going to Berklee or college in general is meeting people and getting to know yourself. I learned probably just as much from my fellow students as I did from the college itself.",

                    "comment": "First off, I\u2019m much older than you. I have a daughter who is a freshman in college and I graduated Berklee in \u201894. I was in the first graduating class of the Music Business &amp; Management program. Guinea pigs we were. Looking back I wish I took MP&amp;E, but that\u2019s a whole other discussion. \n\nAt the time when I applied I could read music and prepare any piece on my principle instrument drums and some piano pieces, but to this day I still cannot sight read. I knew a decent amount of music theory. To put it in perspective, after my audition with Skip Hadden I met with a member of the department of admissions and he said the music theory that I knew at the time were steps 1, 3, and some of 5, but didn\u2019t know 2, 4, and 6. That\u2019s at least how he put it. \n\nIf I had to describe where I\u2019m at with my \u201ccareer\u201d now I would say it\u2019s comparable to playing AAA minor league baseball with time in AA and a 21 day stint in the majors. In all seriousness, I am an endorsing artist for Evans, Paiste, and GMS, but I believe that\u2019s purely due to the exposure my bands have/had and not because of my ability. I have a handful nationally distributed albums that have been in magazines and all over college radio. To this day I play shows to as many as 2000 people to as little as playing to the bartenders and the other bands. I own a business that I built up over the years while both on &amp; off tour that runs pretty much on it\u2019s own which allows me to be selective in who I play with. My wife calls me an \u201cart snob\u201d. I say that I only play with people I want to play with that want to do more than just play in the town they live in. Bottom line, if I want to be happy I can\u2019t stop touring and recording, but it\u2019s in the \u201cnothing special level\u201d to where I\u2019m still sharing hotel rooms with 3 other band members and always traveling in a van. \n\nIf you care to hear a couple of my bands:\n\nThe Veldt - Shoegaze band of twin brothers that I have played on &amp; off with since 2019. I am currently playing with these guys a decent amount now. We will be on the road in May for 3 weeks. Excuse the first few seconds of distortion in the first video https://www.instagram.com/tv/CakW-9OgEeM/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y= and https://www.instagram.com/p/B_PeAZSpyYH/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=\n\nPalomar - Indie-pop band of 3 ladies &amp; me. I played with these guys for 10 years straight and still do a few reunion shows a year today. Here\u2019s one song from everyone of our albums: https://youtu.be/2wR1f0CPABI , https://youtu.be/8rmw8_g7A2I , and https://youtu.be/Qkl9OywMkho\n\nThanks for letting me share my story.",

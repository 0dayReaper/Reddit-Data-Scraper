We deeply appreciate your hard work, dedication, resilience, and creative energy. Today, we\u2019d like to take a moment to discuss our fall semester planning, which is now our primary focus.\nFirst and foremost, we are strongly committed to providing a safe campus environment, one in which the health and wellbeing of our community members is fully considered. Our firm intention is to reopen our campus in time for the fall, but of course, we must adhere to state and federal guidelines and our own requirements for reopening safely.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs we consider reopening plans, we are engaging in a deliberate process in alignment with those state and federal agency guidelines, in close communication with the City of Boston, and with the support of our partners at Tufts Medical Center and others in Boston\u2019s healthcare system. No matter what, we suspect the conditions will be different from the ways we occupied campus before the pandemic; we will adapt the physical space, adjust the resources we have on-hand, and craft policies and procedures to support the safety of our community. In particular, social distancing requirements will likely demand very different behavior from all of us, such as flexible use of classrooms and other spaces, and perhaps varied schedules.\u00a0\nOn Monday, May 18, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker announced additional details for his\u00a0four-phase plan\u00a0to reopen the state. This plan includes specific guidelines for institutions of higher education:\u00a0\n\nProtect the health and safety of students, faculty, staff, and people in surrounding communities.\u00a0\n\nEnable students to make meaningful progress towards their educational goals.\u00a0\n\nContribute to research and innovation.\u00a0\n\nMinimize adverse economic impact on families, employees, and the Massachusetts economy.\u00a0\n\nBerklee will follow these guidelines as we, too, take a flexible, stepwise approach to reopening, which is currently being developed by teams established from across the institution.\u00a0Three Continuity Planning Groups (CPG)\u00a0are working on fall plans: academic, enrollment, and resources and operations. A CPG Executive Steering Committee is charged with institutional coordination and providing recommendations to the president and the executive team for decision making.\nThough returning to campus is clearly a complicated, multifaceted undertaking, we are focused primarily on eight main action items that will precede our return:\u00a0\n\nthe availability of rapid testing to quickly diagnose individuals with the virus;\u00a0\n\nthe establishment of social-distancing procedures and policies to reduce the likelihood of additional infections;\u00a0\n\nthe availability of a reliable, robust contact-tracing system for alerting those who might have been exposed so that they can quarantine to prevent further spread;\u00a0\n\nthe capacity for quarantining and isolating exposed or diagnosed students on campus;\u00a0\n\nthe availability of health and wellness support for students, faculty, and staff;\n\na careful review of appropriate on-campus staffing levels;\n\nthe development of sustainable, rigorous cleaning procedures to reduce risk of further infection;\n\nand the development of a culture of shared responsibility on our campus to support our collective health and safety.\u00a0\n\nWe have a great deal of work ahead of us as we continue to face these unprecedented challenges. But we are confident in our community\u2019s ability to come together to accomplish what we set out to do, and right now, our focus is sharply on safely returning to our campus as soon as we possibly can. We value your input, and welcome any\u00a0questions, comments, and suggestions\u00a0you may have as we move forward together. We will continue to keep you updated as things progress.\u00a0\nSincerely,\u00a0\nBetsy Newman\nSenior Vice President for Student Enrollment and Engagement\nBerklee\nLarry Simpson\nSenior Vice President for Academic Affairs/Provost\nBerklee\nCathy Young\u00a0\nSenior Vice President and Executive Director\u00a0\nBoston Conservatory at Berklee\nMac Hisey\nSenior Vice President of Administration and Finance/CFO/CIO\nBerklee",

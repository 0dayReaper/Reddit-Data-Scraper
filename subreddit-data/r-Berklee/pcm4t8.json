    "postText": "Can you enroll in the spring semester 2022 batch and then as fall semester 2023 begins, you join the folks from 2022 fall batch, advancing to the sophomore year with attending just one semester for freshman year, given that you transfer credits from berklee online courses? Is that possible? If it is, would you recommend it? Saving on rent is one reason. \n\nUnrelated: would odds of getting in and amount of scholarship be affected by the phase of audition (early action, etc.) Or the semester- fall/spring?\n\nP.S. I can elaborate if you don't get it.",

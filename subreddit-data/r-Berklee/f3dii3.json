I'm interested in having work done on my guitar to add a \"zeroth fret\" to the highest two strings of my baritone electric guitar, like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFX5AQRg8Ko&amp;t=80s\n\nDoes anyone have recommendations on a shop where this could be done well? While I'm at it I'd love to get the guitar set up and have one of the pickups swapped out.",

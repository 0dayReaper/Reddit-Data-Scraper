    "postText": "hello mates! I'm planning to study at Berklee next term, and I got a reasonable scholarship so I'm going to cover on my own, but it would leave me broke and I.\n\nI need to cover living expenses like dorm rent, food, books, equity, etc. For students who have not graduated, I would like you to help me by telling me: how much did you spend when you were at Berklee or how much are you spending.\n\nBecause I know there is a scholarship called presidential scholarship that covers everything (including, living expenses, etc) but I have read that it is very hard to get it, and I am an international student, so.... I don't have loans or any other financial aid offered by the US government.\n\nI am studying at a berklee global partner institution and then I will transfer my credits to berklee. So I only need an estimated amount for the 2 years I will be at Berklee.",

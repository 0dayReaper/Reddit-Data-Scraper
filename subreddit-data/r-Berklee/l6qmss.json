    "postText": "Hi :) I'm worried about the audition\ud83d\ude22\nAs you know, I will take the zoom audition. I'm thinking about which piano to play.\ud83d\ude2d\nIf I play the acoustic piano, I have to install the microphone separately and I will feel uncomfortable when I turn on the MR.\nThe electronic piano is connected directly to the audio interface, so it is comfortable, but I am worried that it will be able to bring out the touch well.\nDid anyone take the audition or do you have any tips?\nThank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc95",

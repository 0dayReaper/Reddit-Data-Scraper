I don't know what the application process looks like nowadays (I applied in 2009), but it should be written somewhere in the online portal what kind of forms and visas you would need as an international applicant.\n\nBerklee also has a many partner facilities around the world.  If your application is accepted, you'll probably be invited to the nearest one to where you live for an audition (unless you're already planning to travel all the way to the Boston or Valencia campus to audition, which I guess is also an option).\n\nAlso check with your school if they offer any help for students who want to apply to study in US.",

We had to provide high school records sent by her school (could not send via the credentials agency because not from the USA). She did an online audition which went very well. When she was accepted we had to provide proof that we could pay for Berklee fees and give a letter from the bank stating our net deposits before we could start applying for her student visa. It\u2019s quite a business, and the charges for the visa alone were about $1000. Getting the bank letter was a massive hassle too as my main bank isn\u2019t in Australia.",

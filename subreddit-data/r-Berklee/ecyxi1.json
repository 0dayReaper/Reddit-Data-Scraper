    "postText": "Hey guys I\u2019m new to the sub but am in need of help. I just got accepted into Berklee\u2019s undergraduate program. But I only received a $15,000 scholarship. Berklee costs about $73k. I got 6k from the fafsa, but that still is only 21k. It\u2019s my dream to go to Berklee, but I can\u2019t feasibly pay for it. I live with just my dad and he\u2019s is very low income. I wanna make my dream come true, but I can\u2019t live in debt. What do I do?",

I reccomend doing Holland College, as you pay in CAD and the USD goes even further up there. You can do up to 2 years ( \u2248 64 Credits) there with the contract they have with berklee and end with 2 years at Berklee and finish with BOTH degrees from both schools. \n\nIn addition, working summers for companies with tuition assistance (like UPS, Starbucks, etc.) SUCKS but it really helps. I've been at UPS for a year and you can make some serious money. It's soul-crushing work, but Berklee was my dream, and choosing to study there was the best decision I've made in my life. \n\nGood luck figuring everything out, I believe in you. There's always a way if you can be creative about it.",

            "comment": "First off, congrats! If you\u2019re going for a degree, get your liberal arts out of the way before you come, you\u2019ll save a ton of money and you can focus your time on music. I did the CLEP exams (like an AP exam open to everyone, they\u2019re easier too), which Berklee accepts as liberal arts transfer credit. For the cost of 7 $80 exams (and the time it took studying), I got 21 transfer credits (a semester and a half). I didn\u2019t even have to pay this fee if I redid things, [Modern States](modernstates.org) is a nonprofit that offers free CLEP prep courses which upon their completion gives you fee waivers.\n\nAs well, try to teach yourself the basic core music stuff, you can find all the books (Harmony 1-4, Arranging 2, Ear Training 4. If you come, you\u2019ll get a diagnostic test that if completed successfully, allows you to skip that required course. Music Technology (MTEC) is another required course you can test out of, the notes are available online.\n\nGlobal Partnership as some have mentioned is a great program, but for me, I came straight to Berklee because I can graduate quicker. With my transfer credits, entering test and MTEC testout I already had 37 credits (a year plus half a semester). I will take some Berklee online courses this summer for the required liberal arts courses I can\u2019t do elsewhere (e.g. art history, music and society, history of european music, music history elective) and test out next month of tonal harmony (another required course). With all said in done, I hope do graduate in 2.5 years. All the best!",

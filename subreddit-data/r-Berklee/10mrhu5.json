    "postText": "Hey yall! Im a high school senior girl, im auditioning as a vocalist and i have no idea what to wear and how to do my makeup. For context my general style is a little on the alternative side (im using alt as a LOOSE definition.) i typically wear heavy black liner or graphic black liner and big lashes, and my casual outfits are pretty generic, baggy jeans, doc martens, baggy jeans, small tanks, silver jewelery, crystals, weird earrings (think your typical tiktok gen z kid). I dont wanna dress in a way that completely changes the was i present myself as a person. I dont mind dresses, heels or dress pants. So does anyone have ideas for fits and makeup?  thank you!!!!!!",

OP, I think the main point is to avoid looking like you don't care, which to me mostly means: don't look like a slob. But as far as clothing or makeup style, just be yourself. If you aren't used to dressing up, don't. You don't want to be uncomfortable in an outfit you're not used to. Dress in what would put you in your most confident frame of mind.",

However, don't lose your own personality and your own personal style. Be yourself. But most of all, be comfortable and confident!",

    "postText": "Maybe this is a dumb question, but I'm just a little worried that I'll be judged or maybe even excluded/etc. for growing up poor/living in a trailer park/etc. when I go to Berklee, partially because it's a very expensive school (and thus most of the students will likely be on the wealthier side) (and it is in a very rich neighborhood, or between them or whatever) and partially cause people are mean or even unintentionally judgemental. And I know it's something my dad is really worried about for me. And it makes me kind of sad thinking about the idea of having to work twice as hard as everyone else to be taken just as seriously or for the fact that it may make me ashamed of my background which I'm not, I'm proud to be able to say I haven't had any help in terms of wealth/any other opportunities that can extend from that and that I've made it where I am. So, if anyone else grew up living in a trailer park, poor, whatever, and went to Berklee, I'm curious as to how the experience was/is for you in that regard. Thanks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Incoming (Poor) Freshman",

We connect through music and that\u2019s the most important thing you should never forget. If someone judges you based on how much money you got\u2026they\u2019re not the people you want to be around in the first place.  All you have to do is be kind, a bit sociable, and be a good musician and I\u2019m sure you already are because you got accepted. Nothing else matters.",

I know kids who grew up rich in Cali and never paid a dime of their own tuition, I also know kids who grew up poor or maybe overseas and never owned a dime in the first place. Nobody gets treated differently for it though.\n\nExpect some culture shock but don\u2019t feel weird if other people didn\u2019t have the same experience as you. Also, if you don\u2019t feel financially stable in Boston, I highly recommend student employment- I make enough to pay my entire rent just working for the school!",

However, I just experienced my freshman year at Berklee, and I\u2019m heading into my sophomore year. I feel like Berklee is a very accepting place. There are people from all walks of life, who are brought together through their passion for music. I do think that there are some spoiled rich kids. That\u2019s every school, though. I do think that a lot of the students, whether they grew up poor or not, bond over their economic struggles. Most of us have trouble finding housing and being able to afford living in Boston or anywhere as an artist. I also have plenty of friends who are very open about being on scholarship and having to work. I hope this helps! Feel free to DM me if you have any questions, and good luck at Berklee this year.",

I spent a couple years playing in bands &amp; studios to save up the money to go. I was totally at the bottom of the wealth ladder and nobody cared, other than friends who would occasionally buy me dinner or something because they knew I was struggling financially.",

            "comment": "Judging by your post history (from _just this month_) you are a parrot for Fox News \n\nLet's start with you saying \"you don't have a problem with democrats and liberal people in general\" with this quote from your post history:\n\n&gt; Classic liberals ruining a perfectly good Pink Floyd reference\n\nAnd then jumping straight into your highly-nuanced and researched political views:\n\n&gt; questioning the results of an election when evidence is presented that shows that the election results may have been tampered with is only logical\n\n&gt; Also Biden has done plenty in his time as president and very little of it has been good. The economy has been trash and gas prices are ridiculous, and not to mention the fact that he is fueling this horrendous war in Ukraine\n\n&gt; he\u2019s got dementia. He is not fit to be president. Look at any of his speeches and you\u2019ll clearly see he\u2019s not fit to be president. He belongs in assisted living, not the Oval Office!\n\nHere's another fun one, straight from Tucker Carlson's puckered asshole to your lips:\n\n&gt; Ukrainian people actually want to be a part of Russia\n\nThese could be verbatim from the anti-trans playbook:\n\n&gt; A lot of people transition and deeply regret it later in life, but they can\u2019t go back because once you\u2019ve taken hormone blockers or even done surgery, there is no going back\n\n&gt; puberty blockers are not safe, that\u2019s a straight up lie\n\nAnd some fun toxic masculinity to boot:\n\n&gt; there is no excuse for crying because it can be helped.\n\n&gt; Lol it\u2019s not an incel post it\u2019s something that legit happens a lot. Friend zoning is a thing my guy.\n\nShitting on other religions, because Christians definitely are always holy and right. There's no hate quite like Christian love:\n\n&gt; I don\u2019t care if Islam is the true religion. From the things it teaches and the way it\u2019s followers act, I can tell that if allah is real he\u2019s a sick and evil god who I don\u2019t want to follow. I\u2019d take hell over following Islam.\n\nYou will (and should) be roasted at Berklee for believing these things; none of them are based in fact. I'd recommend you take a good, hard look at the direction you're going if you don't want to spend your life as an outcast and  \"incel\"",

                    "comment": "Ok well let\u2019s go by each of these quotes one by one:\n\n1. I was being sarcastic for that one\n2. I don\u2019t think the election was rigged at all. I just think that it should not be out of the question to think that there is a possibility of something like that occurring. People should always be able to question the government because if we don\u2019t then the government will become tyrannical. There are plenty of places in which elections have been rigged. That being said, I have not seen sufficient evidence to conclude that the 2020 election was rigged, so I do not believe that. The election was not rigged. \n3. The economy is very very terrible, gas  price is incredibly high. Those are undeniable facts. And yes he is fueling the war in Ukraine when that is none of Americas business IMO. \n4. Look at any of his speeches and it\u2019s clear as day that it\u2019s not all there in Bidens head. This is not an exclusively conservative opinion either, there are MANY democrats who agree that Biden is not mentally fit for office. That has nothing to do with his politics, it\u2019s just the fact that he is the oldest president in American history who has some very obvious signs of dementia. \n5. Many of them do, especially in the areas that Russia was first invading. Not all of them do, but a lot of them do. I would recommend watching the documentary \u201cUkraine On Fire\u201d, it shows very well how nuanced this war really is. It\u2019s not just \u201cRussia bad, Ukraine good\u201d, it\u2019s a far reaching dispute between two countries that is very nuanced and complicated. \n6. A lot of people who do transition do regret it. Plenty don\u2019t and all the power to them for finding what makes them happy, but plenty of people do regret it. And it is factual that surgery and puberty blockers are not something that you can completely go back from. You can detransition but if you do you\u2019re still not gonna be nearly the same as you would have been if you had never transitioned. Let me note that I am not hateful of trans people at all, I just think that they should make an informed decision beforehand and should not be making the decision when they are young children. \n7. Ok so I guess if your goal is always to transition and you never change your mind, perhaps puberty blockers are a good option, but if you\u2019re 12 and start taking puberty blockers and then decide that you don\u2019t want to transition later, there\u2019s gonna be some serious harm done. What, do you seriously think that you can just hit pause on puberty and then come back 5 years later and have a normal puberty and move on with your life. Hell no! This isn\u2019t something that\u2019s completely reversible, and I do not think that a young child should be able to make a decision like this because if you make a bad decision when it comes to this, you can seriously fuck up your life.\n8. Ok that was a joke, I was once again being sarcastic. \n9. Friend zoning is a thing, it\u2019s not being an incel to say that it is. \n10. Have you been reading the news? Have you been hearing what\u2019s been happening with women being forced to wear a hijab and being slaughtered if they don\u2019t? Have you ever heard of gay people being thrown off buildings or hung just because they\u2019re gay? Have you ever heard of any of the many many terrorist attacks that have occurred in the past 20 years? ALL of these things are because of Islam and it\u2019s harsh teachings. I\u2019m assuming you would consider yourself a liberal, so as a liberal you should definitely agree with me on this, because Islam goes directly against EVERYTHING liberals stand for. There is slight no acceptance or tolerance anywhere in their religion. Now I\u2019m not saying that Muslims can\u2019t be good people, there are plenty of peaceful Muslims who don\u2019t do any of these terrible things, but I would like to note that there are no other religions that are doing any of this stuff. Only Islam. I think people can follow whatever religion they want to and I will respect peoples beliefs, but for the above reasons, I could never follow Islam myself. That was the point of that comment. \n\nAt the end of the day, taking me out of context just to prove a point is low. I came here asking for an answer to a simple question and you have to come here attacking me, and that is not right. How about a little acceptance and tolerance yourself.",

I\u2019ve been getting gas in Texas for $2.30 a gallon and in Boston for ~$4 (it\u2019s been a minute though since I\u2019ve been in Texas for the winter). I wouldn\u2019t call those high at all, especially in the context of prices half a year ago. If your prices are high, chances are it\u2019s a state issue and not a federal one.\n4. Reading your explanations and your opinions, I have concluded that you have dementia and are unfit for the oval office.\n5. Some Ukrainians still believe in the whole unified Soviets mentality. There are balkans who also wish Yugoslavia never broke up. However, the vast majority does not want this AT ALL. To your credit, there are some countries who do wish to join Russia again but are unable to due to political rules and idiosyncrasies.\n6. After living in Austin for many years, staying in Denver for months on end, and attending Berklee for a few years\u2026 yeah, no, you have the wrong idea about this. Trans people rarely regret it, but it is hard as a person to go from the gender you\u2019ve been using for years in childhood to one that no one recognizes in you and one that requires a complete change in psyche. But I rarely see people who impulsively transition and regret it (but that doesn\u2019t mean to say there aren\u2019t people who regret it). But yeah, I think trans people are perfectly capable of making an informed decision, and they usually do.\n7. It sounds like you wouldn\u2019t believe in birth control either.\n8. Ok\n9. Ok\n10. Man\u2019s never read up on the Christian Crusades, or the Catholic church\u2019s love for prepubescent recruits. A lot of the Islamic wars right now stem from a difference in beliefs and a difference in political desires. Nowhere does the Quran proclaim the necessity of a massive terrorist war to feed the religious dynasty. In fact, Christianity proclaims this through Revelations and Judgement Day (although Islam believes in Judgement Day\u2014wait, are there more similarities between the religions than you thought?). \n\nDidn\u2019t intend to spark a political discussion in the Berklee subreddit, uhhhh\u2026 I don\u2019t know, what\u2019s y\u2019all\u2019s favorite mode?",

            "comment": "\"Woke\" is a term used by certain political and media personalities to criticize others for being open-minded, inclusive, factual, and empathetic - mainly because those charactistics highlight their own ignorance, racism, bigotry, etc. \n\nMost universities focus on fact-based education, and understand that inclusivity is not only good for business, but good for society. You'll see people from all walks of life, not just conservative Christians. College isn't going to shove \"wokeness\" down your throat, but you will be exposed to evidence-based facts, like the Earth is 4.5 Billion years old, evolution is real, and trickle-down economics is a political term to justify giving tax breaks to rich people. \n\nThe good thing is, being exposed to other viewpoints, peer-reviewed evidence, and meeting others outside your conservative Christian circle makes you well-rounded, employable, and significantly increases your future earning potential. It will also make you realize that being \"woke\" isn't necessarily a bad thing.",

It purely has to do with being openminded to the world out there and the ability to make the right choices for yourself. It is all about thinking for yourself. The fact that you are worried about your parents' approval shows they failed in an area that is exceptionally important in this world.\n\nMy daughter just got back from her first semester at college. I have never once told her where she has to go or what to study to make me happy. All I suggested to her was that she chooses a college/university that is nationally recognized and a major in which she receives a degree that has a certificate of sorts that all but assures a job when she is done be it a nurse/doctor, engineer, teacher, etc. She chose neither.\n\nAt this point all I can do as a good parent is support her as much as I can. It is her life and if I truly love her for who she is that is what I need to do.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I am a liberal who chooses science over religious doctrine. There is no denying that. Unlike many others though, I quite frankly could not care less what direction you swing. Believe god is some man who used to walk this earth or the spaghetti monster, lives up in the clouds or is on the bottom of your foot. Believe whatever it is you want, just keep it away from me and the rest of this world to where it affects our lives.",

Louis Armstrong? Billie Holiday?\n\nIs it woke to understand the racism involved in the entertainment industry and at jazz musicians in general, and how that motivated many to be greater than great. To be respected and not called a BOY everywhere they went. Do you know white people called it Jungle Music? \n\nIs it woke to understand that women were under appreciated and downright abused in the entertainment world and deserve better? \n\nYou need education.

If that\u2019s your definition of woke then by all means find another career. \n\nYou know as a matter of fact, after typing this I\u2019m realizing, you should go.

Going to a high school where most kids grew up locally doesn\u2019t really show you much of the world. I would say the same for going to a local community college or small state school. However, going to a world-renowned school that attracts many international students and kids from all walks of life definitely changed my mind. Hanging out with random people in the dorms, in the cafeteria, in class, in jam sessions, etc., I was exposed to constant new music, new concepts, new ideas, and interacted with people I never would have met if I stayed back home for school. \n\nNo one made me atheist or tried to change my mind. I made the decision on my own after seeing the world without a blindfold or filter over my eyes. The same thing can happen at any college with out-of-state or international students or if you move to another state. The issue isn\u2019t Berklee, but whether or not you\u2019re in an environment outside of your parents\u2019 reality distortion field. Good luck with your decision.",

If you are scared of meeting some Jews and Muslims and Hindus and Atheists and what have you, you should stick to your echo chamber, but don\u2019t think that being around non-Christians will make you less Christian. Believe what you want to believe, but remember that intolerance is fundamentally counter to your holy book. The \u201cwoke\u201d folk you fear get up in arms because they want to defend the oppressed, the defenseless, and the institutionally voiceless. The only thing they don\u2019t tolerate is systemic intolerance itself. Far-Right Conservative movements by definition are intolerant towards minority groups, free thinkers, and rebels. Unfortunately it sounds like you\u2019re in the latter right now, but expanding your horizons is possible.   \n  \nYou don\u2019t have to go full leftist to fit in (I sure as hell have some choice words for the most extreme left-wing people at Berklee), but you\u2019ll find that by chasing honest education, open discussion, art, and critical thought, it\u2019s kind of impossible to not end up moving the left philosophically. The left fundamentally is based on a culture of empathy, even if the intent doesn\u2019t always reflect the end result. I\u2019m not sure if I can say the same about the right.   \n  \n I guess last thing \u2014 if you choose to apply and come to Boston, you will have culture shock as a small-town conservative. You\u2019re gonna be corrected, you\u2019re gonna be called out, you\u2019re gonna have your ideas challenged, and you\u2019re gonna be asked to defend your ideas. Take it as a time to reflect on why you think the way you do. Metacognition is a bitch, but well worth it once you start getting the hang of it, no matter where you come from or who you are. Don\u2019t be automatically defensive and you might be surprised about what the core of your belief systems really is.\n  \nBe well man. And fuck worrying about your parents. You\u2019re your own person, grow however you wanna grow and don\u2019t let anyone make you feel fearful of that growth or hold you back in any way.",

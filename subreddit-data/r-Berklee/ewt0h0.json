    "postText": "So I\u2019m based in Beijing, China but am an international student with ties to Singapore. Waaay back when I completed my application, they had scheduled me for an audition in Singapore next week\u2014however due to the recent coronavirus concerns, I am barred from entering the country and thus won\u2019t be able to travel and make the audition.\n\nBerklee admissions understood this and suggested an online audition as a possibility. How would this work as a drumset primary? I know there\u2019s a sight-reading part, how would they give it? \n\nDoes anyone have any experience doing an online audition to Berklee? Thanks!",

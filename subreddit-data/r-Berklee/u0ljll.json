(BTW are there cute girls in berklee??)\n\nHave to do 2 or more jobs for money??\n\nYou guys can share all your positive and negative opinions bout everything in and around the college(not only the above questions) .

            "comment": "Hey! I am on a full scholarship at Berklee, and I would honestly never pay the tuition amount to go to Berklee. People don\u2019t even realize that they are schools in Canada with the same opportunities of learning but that cost max 5k per semester. THE PRICE TAG IS INSANE FOR EVERYTHING AT BERKLEE. They raise tuition every year, they find a way to charge you for everything and even the teachers think it\u2019s too pricey. Don\u2019t go to Berklee unless you have money or a significant scholarship. I don\u2019t say this because I don\u2019t like it, I love Berklee, it\u2019s just not worth that price tag. So many people go to Berklee and have access to no opportunities. Sadly, you have to already be good to be in the bpc shows, to get the gigs, the big studio sessions, etc. I honestly don\u2019t have that many gigs, my teachers are not that good compared to some I had in my country. Yes the girls are cute! You should get at job ASAP before they raise the tuition and your financial plans are ruined. That said, berklee has also amazing aspects; you meet people from all around the world, you the curriculum is very good, the possibilities of studying many music subjects are endless (with pro music and another major as a double major, you can take classes from 4 different majors it\u2019s crazy).",

Searched everywhrre and only berklee had it.\nAbout the opportunities, you know it's not like a mainstream course or program like engineering or commerce, so I've heard it somewhere that schools like berklee are amplifier not a generator, so we have to barge in where ever we can to get opportunities.\nIt's so nice to get girls who are musicians too\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06, I really hope there cute and thanks for clarifying it\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude09",

Yes, it\u2019s still a top notch school and a lovely place located in a magical city where you can make great friends BUT\u2026 The person with the full scholarship that wrote before told a big truth! Having a full scholarship with no opportunities for gigs\u2026 At Berklee I met one of the best female vocalists ever from China where she was already famous in her country with amazing voice and everything and had literally NO SHOWS at Berklee! You know why? Because most people there are either a clique where they are giving the shows to people who belong to their clique or people who already have record label contracts from their home country and they are using Berklee as a promo for their career! BE SMART LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND DON\u2019T LET ANYONE FOOL YOU!",

That doesn\u2019t mean though that it happens all the time but it\u2019s a pretty repetitive and common pattern there!\n\nSongwriting major has an angel as a Professor who is the person who created the program! He is a lovely person! The other Professors though are meh with some exceptions!\nWhat you have to understand is that Berklee is a business and it has one of the best marketing teams in the industry!\n\nI know many examples of people that used Berklee as a promo for their career! That doesn\u2019t happen only at Berklee though! This is called \u201clegacy students\u201d and of course in a music school this happens to be bold and unpleasant.",

Some are good and some are bad.\n\nNot only berklee, all the school, uni and college are business, they don't care bout us. What is a service for us it's business for them. As far as they have good teachers the college will be in a good rank. \n\nI'm sorry for all these nonsense, I'm tryna cope and console myself that berklee is not bad.",

There are no official rankings for it. \n\nFor example Harvard, Imperial College of London etc have specific rankings and placements. Berklee doesn\u2019t. Of course it is considered together with Julliard to be the best schools for music but there isn\u2019t an official list if you know what I mean!\n\nAlso, one thing that is very annoying is that Berklee as far as performances are concerned is a Jazz oriented school. That means that if you are not a Jazz musician you are not taken seriously at all!\n\nBack in the 90s and in 00s that wasn\u2019t the case! Metal, Rock, Pop, Jazz were equally accepted! Nowadays Berklee is a Jazz/RnB school with whatever that means.\n\nNevertheless, I believe that if you have a combination of money and scholarships Berklee is a great experience located in a lovely city!",

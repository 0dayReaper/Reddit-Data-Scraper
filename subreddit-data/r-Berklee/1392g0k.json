    "postText": "Hi - My son has been on the waitlist for Berklee Boston and Berklee Valencia as a freshman for September. He found out just now he didn't get in but the admissions email specified Berklee Boston. Does anyone know if the Spain program would be issuing its own email or was this one for both? At one point there was an email promoting the Spain option and it said if you join that WL they will email you \"on May 9.\"  I don't want him holding out hope for a different decision on May 9 if that door is closed.\n\n(Separately - He decided rather late to apply and didn't put in as much effort as optimal in preparing for the audition. (He auditioned on keyboard but wants to major in music production.) He has accepted a spot at Drexel University's RAMP program but was talking about possibly applying again and transfering to Berklee at a later point. Any advice on whether that's worthwhile and whether he would be more likely to get in?\n\nThanks in advance!",

I mentioned the audition because they don\u2019t have an audition format for music producers. They required him to audition on an instrument even though that isn\u2019t what he has studied. That seems to handicap kids who aren\u2019t performance focused so I wondered if spending time studying piano would make a difference. It would seem hard for someone who isn\u2019t a piano star to be up to the standard of people who have dedicated themselves to the instrument.",

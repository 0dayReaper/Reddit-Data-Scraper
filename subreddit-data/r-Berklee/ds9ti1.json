However, I do consider improv my strong suit, my prepared piece was actually completely improvised (it was a blues). But what I\u2019m getting at is they definitely don\u2019t just give the scholarships to the dude or dudette that can do it all, it\u2019s all circumstantial. You\u2019ll be fine man have a blast and play what you know and how you know. Let yourself shine through and put that over trying to impress the judges with technicality. Let me know if you have any other questions bro!",

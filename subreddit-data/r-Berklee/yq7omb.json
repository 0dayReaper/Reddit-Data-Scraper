Get your reading together. Those who read well get higher ratings than those who don\u2019t, and the better ratings, the better ensembles you can get in. Learn as much ear training as you can. Also, Berklee is expensive, you may want to get your History and English at a local university. A funny story: when I was there, I remember this homeless guy who came in the building one day who told a few of us the graduated from Berklee\u2026.Didn\u2019t inspire much confidence in our paths\u2026",

Not just keeping up with a planner, but managing practice time well, doing homework at times where you can actually focus on it, and learning to prioritize all your Berklee activities. There are so many things to learn and do here, and the reality is there\u2019s never enough time to do them all. Have fun and come say hey once you get here!",

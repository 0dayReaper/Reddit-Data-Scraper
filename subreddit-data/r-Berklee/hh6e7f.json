Does anyone know where I can get the syllabus\u2019 for the classes, so I know exactly what to study and place into higher level classes?",

I got placed in Harmony 3 and Ear Training 3 without any preparations. \n\nHowever if you want textbooks for harmony DM me and I\u2019ll send a pdf",

I\u2019m pretty sure the harmony you learned is what we call \u201cTonal\u201d harmony. \n\nNot saying you haven\u2019t learned the berklee way, just, their \u201cHarmony\u201d classes are jazz harmony based. Rather than a more classic understanding of it. You could definitely test out of \u201cTonal\u201d Harmony and even counterpoint. Those classes are really annoying if you aren\u2019t thinking about going into a composition major.",

            "comment": "This right here is Berklee\u2019s best kept secret. \n\nDuring orientation week, you will have the opportunity to take an assessment test for Music Theory, Ear Training, and Arrangement. The 3 \u201ccore\u201d music studies at Berklee. Each one of these subjects has 4 semesters of classes. \n\nThe better you do on these assessments, the more classes you are able to skip.   The more you are able to skip, the quicker you get to take awesome electives related to your major.  If you don\u2019t test out of any of these, you will still need to be taking them in your second year which means you won\u2019t have space in your schedule (or credits available without paying \u00e0 la carte) to take those other awesome classes. \n\nLearn your solfege, transcribe songs to develop your ear, study music notation, and read up on JAZZ harmony (music theory does not go over classical or tonal theory - that\u2019s a separate required pair of classes that you can also test out of). \n\nI was able to test out of Ear Training 1 and Harmony 1&amp;2 but had to take all four arranging courses because I wasn\u2019t aware of the \u201cimaginary bar line\u201d.  You\u2019ll thank yourself down the road when you have no core classes to take by your 3rd or 4th semester and can take awesome classes (not that those core classes aren\u2019t fun). If you have enough available credits, you can even get earn a minor by \u201caccidentally\u201d taking all the required course for that minor.",

I thought I had the whole summer to prep for these placement tests, but unfortunately, they changed their policy, and we now have to take them online and submit them by July 17! I have A LOT of cramming to do! On the bright side, one kind stranger on here sent me a link to some pdfs of a few Berklee books, so that should be a big help!",

Berklee is pretty awful compared to most expensive private schools for financial aid. \n\nI got almost nothing from them, because they were basing my family's income off the past 3 years, ignoring that my father was 8 month unemployed and dying from cancer. The income 3 years ago is what mattered to them. So I'm deeply into student loan debt. Yay!",

Excuse if any of this is already known to you. I have watched many, many vids of people in your same position, and almost to a person, their option was to decline and then audition again. And again.. Until their financial aid package rose high enough to make it doable. If Berklee accepted you, they will again. 50% who audition get accepted. But only 30% end up going. I am sure a ton for financial reasons. It sucks to get in and not to be able to go. But hopefully it's just not go... yet. This vid was very informative to me.

Reapplying is one option for more scholarship  but also consider maybe studying at a berklee sister college or another uni and to be able to transfer or write off core courses/liberal art. \n\nWhen I realised how expensive it was going to get  I reapplied and also in the year I waited went to a berklee transfer school that was way cheaper so I could transfer credits.  You can graduate in 4 semesters with a degree and significantly less costs this way.",

You can shop here: https://berklee.bncollege.com/shop/berklee/home\n\nHonestly, you\u2019d really want to look at your individual pathway depending on the major you\u2019re looking at. Maybe even join the entering class FB group(s) and ask around for the major grids! That\u2019ll lay out the full curriculum of the major you want, specifically the core music courses you\u2019d need to take. Berklee doesn\u2019t advertise this, but you can test out of nearly every one of the core classes if you approach the department heads and ask to do so.\n\nGrids can be found here but are restricted (you might be able to access if you\u2019ve been accepted): https://college.berklee.edu/academic-advising/major-grids\n\nIf you dig you can also find a lot of the info without the grids. For example, this page outlines the core music curriculum and the sub-sections go into detail on the individual course names/numbers. That\u2019s the info you\u2019ll need to find the texts: https://college.berklee.edu/core-music-curriculum\nFor example, the harmony page lays out the first 4 semesters of harmony courses that all entering students take unless they test out of them:\n\nPW-111: Music Application and Theory\nHR-112: Harmony 2\nHR-211: Harmony 3\nHR-212: Harmony 4",

You won't be able to pay that money back without getting a real job, ad you will have a harder time getting a real job if you have a worthless music degree. I graduated in 2012 from Berklee, starved for years, finally went to a coding bootcamp in 2016 and now I actually make money and can support my family. Think about retirement too. If you have a measly gig or project based salary you will have a harder time saving for your future. Now I max out my Roth IRA and 401(k) every year. \n\nThink seriously about your future before going into that kind of debt You're better off saving the money and using it to fund your living while you make music and learn from YouTube tutorials.",

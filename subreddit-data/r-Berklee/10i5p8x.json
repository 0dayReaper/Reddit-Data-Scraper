            "comment": "I auditioned at campus last year while I was at the aspire program and got in. My instrument was EDI, so I produced an original track and performed it. I did a little bit of finger drumming, clip launching, improvisation on the keys, and played some live percussion on top of it. \n\nHere\u2019s a list of what they\u2019ll go through:\n\n- Sight reading melodies and rhythm\n- Rhythm playback\n- Improvising over music\n- Chord identification \n- Scales (not 100% sure because I was so nervous I can\u2019t remember)\n\nI think it\u2019s good practice to have a back up (perhaps a non original song) just in case, but I doubt you\u2019d need it. I dont think you\u2019d have time to perform 2 tracks unless they\u2019re really short or one of them doesn\u2019t really show off your talents.",

            "comment": "I think it kinda depends on which instrument you are auditioning with. I am a bassist and I had my auditions online. I invited several of my friends to play with me for the prepared piece to show that I am comfortable in playing with an ensemble. Berklee won't provide accompanists, so you either audition with backing (tracks or real instruments) or without backing.",

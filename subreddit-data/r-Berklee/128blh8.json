I know it\u2019s expensive and I haven\u2019t gotten my fafsa package yet I got around 44k overall for scholarship from Berklee, and I\u2019m might have to take out a loan but I have some support from family. Besides applying for scholarships, posting on social media, and whatnot what are some other good ways to get funding? What are some important things to do when you are at Berklee? How do I make connections in the school order to be hired or offered a record label? Also how is the student life in general, and am I able to cook my own meals in the dorms? Does the school offer classes besides music? Is there a core curriculum? I know I\u2019m asking a bunch of questions I just need general advice coming to music school and how this will be beneficial to me, I am motivated and am always willing to improve. I really want to believe in my self and not stop working.",

I've heard they pay quite well. \n\nYou can cook meals but that depends on which building you go for. They have meal plans anyways. \n\nI think off campus housing is always cheaper. Like a lot cheaper. Berklee students and alumni recommend living on campus for freshman year as that's a great way to make friends and connections. \n\nThere is, in fact a core music curriculum. It'll cover harmony, arranging, ear- training, etc. You can find more information about this on the website. \n\n\nMay I ask how you got such a scholarship? Is it solely because of your audition- interview or did you also attach your original songs, Instagram and stuff? Btw, when did you audition? \n\n\nNote: I'm not a student (yet) and this info might need some review from actual students but it's mostly right.",

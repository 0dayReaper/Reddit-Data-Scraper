    "postText": "Hi guys, I got into Berklee College of Music on a full tuition scholarship. I'm not American so it's a little weird to get one it seems. \nIt would have been the best thing in my life, but I realized I couldn't afford it.\nBerklee's website says I would need $18,000 a year to pay for residency, meal plan, health insurance, etc. I have the support of my family.\nI am supported by my family and I am also working part-time.\nI am not American or Canadian so I don't have access to federal aid. \nAnd the money that is used in my home country is very weak against the US dollar, so all my savings that I have been building up are almost nothing. \nThis is my second time auditioning, the first time I got in but without any scholarship and I skipped a year to prepare and audition this year.\nI don't want to give up this time, I really tried hard to kill them in my audition and interview. And I would feel like I wasted such an opportunity (full tuition scholarship). if I can't find any way to cover the rest of the money. \nThere is no global institution associated with Berklee in my country and there is no financial aid from them. \n\nI don't know if there is any financial aid or any third party scholarships for international students. \nAre there any other Berklee scholarships besides the one I have?\nWhat can you suggest?\nHow can I reduce my living expenses by living on my own?",

Could I apply for financial aid even if I am not an American? \r  \n2. Could you tell me, approximately how much money I can get from the thrive scholarship? I will try very hard to try to get it.  Again, thx so much!",

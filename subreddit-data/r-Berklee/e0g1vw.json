    "postText": "So I recently just got accepted into Berklee and am just wondering when they notify or tell you anything about scholarship money?\nMy audition was just less than 3 weeks ago and I  just accepted their offer of accepting me into the school. \nI\u2019ve heard that scholarship money gets sent later on, but I\u2019m just curious as to how and when do we find out????? Or is it sent along with our acceptance letter?",

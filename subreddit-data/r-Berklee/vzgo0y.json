So things may have changed but as I recall there were not a ton of students there on full scholarships. I know they have also become more selective with admissions since then as well. Not sure if that effects the amount of assistance but per their website they give out 60 million a year in scholarships. \n\nIt seems like at this point, it's a combination of your skills as a performer/student and your need for tuition assistance based on your family's financial situation.",

Corrected it a bunch of times in the main text; didn\u2019t realize there was also an issue with the title too.\n\nActually, noticed you have the same text in your post \ud83d\ude1d\n\nBut thank you for your input",

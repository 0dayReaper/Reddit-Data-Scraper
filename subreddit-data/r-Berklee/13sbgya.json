I am a student enrolled with Berklee Online, and they are having the Berklee On-Site event next weekend (two day, on campus workshops and such).\n\nI was wondering if there are any other students that are attending this, or have in the past, and could write their thoughts about it. \nAlso, wondering if anyone knows of any Boston events or shows during that June 2nd weekend \ud83d\ude0e",

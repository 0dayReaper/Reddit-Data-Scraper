In my state in high school I've gotten the top score in my state's Classical All State, along with 3rd in Jazz this year, so I do feel confident in both genres, but I am really torn on what would be best. I would really appreciate it! Merry Christmas by the way!!",

Berklee has some great things going on classically, but I wouldn\u2019t audition with classical music, as they\u2019d probably ask why you\u2019re not applying to Boston Conservatory (Berklee is contemporary-focused). Jazz/contemporary music is a solid bet, the important thing imo is that you choose a piece that allows you to put yourself forwards in a way that\u2019s true to yourself. Good luck!",

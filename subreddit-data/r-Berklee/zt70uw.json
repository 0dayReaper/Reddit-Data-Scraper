    "postText": "Hello, I am currently struggling on whether or not to attend Berklee. I recently got my acceptance letter and even got a scholarship for 11K! Even with that, I am not quite sure I want to attend. Berklee has been my dream school for so long but I live in Bloomington, Indiana so Jacobs School of Music is right there and I get to experience the life of a Jacob's student. As such, I don't know the student life of Berklee and I don't know how it's like to be at Berklee. Could anyone please help me and give me information on student life and culture at Berklee? Thank you!\n\nEdit: Also, sorry if this seems very formal. I'm new to writing posts on Reddit so I don't know how to do this.",

            "comment": "Maybe I am wrong, but it sounds like you don\u2019t want to leave home because it\u2019s something you know, and Berklee would be something completely new and different to you. Based on that I would say go to Berklee if it\u2019s just down to Jacobs and Berklee.  In my opinion, as much as it\u2019s nice to live in that comfort it\u2019s good to get out and break that comfort.  You can always transfer if you\u2019re not digging it.\n\nIt\u2019s been awhile since I graduated, but the student life was great.  Boston is an awesome city to go to school in.  There\u2019s a bunch of other colleges, so there\u2019s tons of things to do and plenty of people to meet.  Only downside, being a larger city, cost of living is not cheap.  But there are cheaper/free things all the time.\n\nFrom the \u201cis Berklee worth it\u201d perspective, honestly it really depends on you.  Berklee is certainly a place you could graduate from without putting much effort in and get absolutely nothing but debt.  It\u2019s really about what you put into it.  It\u2019s somewhat of a simulation of the real world business.  So if you go out network, and work with others on projects you\u2019ll have a good foundation for when you get out into the real world.",

Other than my hometown friend who convinced me to go, I\u2019ve never been in a band with anyone who\u2019s gone there. I have no regrets. It was under $20K per year when I went, but $60K there is no way that can be justified.",

            "comment": "Berklee is a fine place to go to school, but it better be for nearly $60k per year.    \n\n\nDon't go.  You can be a dedicated student of music by being dedicated and getting out and doing it.  You don't need the classroom for that and you don't need all the debt.   \n\n\n$11k ain't shit on that bill.    \n\n\nMusic is a trust fund sport now and going to Berklee you're going to be around a great deal of trust fund kids that don't NEED to do music.  They just kinda want to do it as a way to other goals.  That is NOT everyone's story.  But if you NEED music, go out and play.    \n\n\nDon't go to this place for an education degree.  Please.  For the love of Jebus DO NOT DO IT.    \n\n\nI have much more to say but in an effort to remain anonymous I must end here.  I think Berklee in 2022 is an absolute rip off and anyone that goes is really just going to say they spent a ton of money on a famous private school.    \n\n\nIf you're a MUSICIAN, go be that.  You don't need Berklee for that.",

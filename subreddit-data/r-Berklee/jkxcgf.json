    "postText": "Hello :)\n\nI\u2019m applying for Fall 2021 from the UK and have been given an online audition a month from now - so I\u2019m preparing hard.\n\nI want to study film composition, with the aim of pursuing a career writing for video games, and Berklee seems to be the best equipped place for this goal - so I thought I would give it a shot.\n\nI\u2019ll be playing piano in my audition, but I am completely, totally classically trained and I don\u2019t really know where to start for the improvisation element. I can improvise things, but it seems like I would be playing along to a preset chord  progression. Can anyone give me some insight as to more specifics on what I will have to do, and what I can do to prepare as best as I can?\n\nThanks so much",

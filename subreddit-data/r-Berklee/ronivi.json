    "postText": "My tonal harmony professor unfairly grades work and takes off much more percent than the question is actually worth if you get it wrong. I got a D on my final and I\u2019m afraid I may fail the class. I already emailed the professor and the harmony department chair about how he cuts corners and rounds up extra points off. If he gives me an F is there some way I can appeal to get the credit?",

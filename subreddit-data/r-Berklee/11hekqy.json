    "postText": "So I applied for the EPD major recently and just got my interview set for a couple of weeks from now and I have literally no clue what to expect. Does anyone here who has gone through the interview process know what kind of questions they're going to be asking and what/if I should prepare anything beforehand? Thanks a lot!",

            "comment": "Hi! I\u2019m an EPD Major who just recently got accepted to the program this Spring semester. From my experience, the interview was just a fairly informal and casual process. I was told in the confirmation email after I submitted my online application that I didn\u2019t have to prepare much for it, but here are some tips. From my experience, the first thing they asked me was the good old, \u201cTell me about yourself\u201d question. This can come in several different responses, but I suggest you first tell them who you are as a musician. I told them about my general musical background, as well as what sparked me to pursue production. I also explained the process of getting into production in the first place and how far I\u2019ve gone since then. Also, if you have knowledge in audio equipment, you can actually get technical with this response as well, and indicate some equipment you use or production techniques you love. (I did this on the essay portion of my online application, but you can do this in the interview as well. I suggest you just explain this to them briefly though). They also asked me if I knew any producers/artists who inspired my production style.\n\nSome tips for these questions is to make sure you give them in-depth answers to these. I suggest not responding with a simple yes or no, or only 1-2 sentences. Make sure you really dive into your desires and interests in production or music in general. The reason for this is because they don\u2019t ask you many questions, but only a few, and these questions are generally open-ended so they\u2019re free for the student to respond with detail, speak genuinely, and express themselves. Towards the end of the interview, they asked me if I had any questions regarding the EPD department. I also suggest you can prepare questions for them, since it will show how curious and interested you are to be in EPD. (e.g. I asked them about course requirements and expectations for specific classes) So you can also indicate what EPD courses you\u2019re interested in taking and explain why you\u2019d like to take them/how it will provide future benefit and fulfill your professional career goals. Look for details in the course catalog for EP courses or EPD Major flowchart online ahead of time.\n\nOverall, a key takeaway is that the EPD faculty looks for interest and dedication in every applicant. The EPD department is rigorous and competitive, so they really want to make sure that you are passionate in being a part of this program and that you\u2019re willing to put the hard work and effort into the studies that this major has to offer. If you can, explain why you personally think you belong in EPD and why you show fondness for the major program. This faculty has high expectations for its students, so make sure you\u2019re really expressing that fondness for the program in your interview responses.\n\nHope this helps!",

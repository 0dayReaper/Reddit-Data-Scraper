Does it impact my admission?Am I actually screwed?Can the federal and state loans and grants pay for admission or is that part of the admission package?Also as far as I\u2019m aware it\u2019s the grant and scholarship Berklee offer as my admission(if I make it)but I believe as long as I turn in the fafsa before March 1 I should be fine,but Berklee makes it sound like it won\u2019t pay for fall of 2020.Can someone explain all this to me and how college aid works in more detail.Thank you.",

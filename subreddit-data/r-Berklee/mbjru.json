The whole \"Boston is our campus\" thing hasn't ever convinced me that it's just their way of making \"sorry, we don't have a campus\" sound better. Normally campuses don't have at least 50% of the foot traffic from people who aren't affiliated with the school... and I wouldn't mind not having homeless people wandering around my campus asking me for change.\n\nBut aside from that, I think Berklee having a more traditional campus would benefit the community by making it more of just that, a community. It's hard to explain without having gone to a school with a traditional campus, but especially with a creative community I feel like it would harbor a sense of creative camaraderie that we don't have since we're so spread out.

I do feel that in his/her POV that fine arts/liberals arts/undeclared major ppl are in a way \"lesser.\"However, I do gotta say tho that music is definitely not easily self-taught as you will need the patience and talent and hard work to get it down and sometimes it takes years to hone that skill. I gotta say that this guy should probably sit down and see how many hours a good musician practice each day so he can understand that we actually use it as a skill to survive and not just any  entertainer out there.",

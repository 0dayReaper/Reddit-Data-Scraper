    "postText": "Hello. I\u2019m applying to the school in a few weeks on DRUM SET for early admission and ofc the audition is online. I had a few questions:\n\n1. How does the improvisation section work??? Do they send me a track or smth?\n\n2. The sight reading section for drums, is it a snare solo or more of a chart with figures I have to hit?\n\n3. Most importantly, how do I play my prepared piece if I have a backing track? I want to prevent latency and any lag issues. How is this dealt with?\n\n3.5. I have a transcription of my prepared piece I would like my interviewers to see, how can I send this to them? Is it worth it to put it in my supplemental materials?\n\nThank you so much. If you have any tips for the online audition please let me know too!",

            "comment": "Hey! I just started at berklee, we had to do a placement audition for ensembles online recently. It\u2019s not the same as the Berklee Audition but I might be able to leave some details with my experience!\n\n1.I had to do improv for mine, and about a week before the audition I was sent a backing track through email. This may be the case for you, it may not, they may send you a backing track over the zoom call.\n\n2. I\u2019m not a drummer, but when I was preparing for my berklee audition, a watched a video where a drummer shared his audition experience and he said he had a chart with figures to hit.\n\n3. For my audition, I plugged my phone into my audio interface and played the backing from my phone (With monitoring so I could hear the track) while playing along,, all your playing should be received together in that case. Another thing you can do is just play a backing track from a speaker! In both of those ways, they are receiving one audio source from you, so even if there is latency your playing with the backing track will still be together!\n\n3.5 Whatever works! If you want to send it in supplemental materials you can, but you can also send it to them in a pdf through zoom at the beginning of the audition!\n\nGood luck! I hope I could help! You\u2019re gonna kill it!",

                    "comment": "Thank you so much for your reply. I only have one question, can you explain how you plugged your phone into your audio interface? By that do you mean that you streamed audio from your computer simultaneously while having your microphone on as well? Playing my backing track over a speaker hasn't worked well yet since the audio quality is degraded a lot and it's really awkward... \n\nI'm not SUPER worried about audio quality though, as I don't think they expect us, applicants, to have a home studio in which the audio is perfectly mixed, right? lol. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for your positive attitude! I'm pretty confident about my audition, I've worked my ass off for this and it will (hopefully) pay off!",

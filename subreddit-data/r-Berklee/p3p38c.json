    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming Berkelee freshman (voice primary) hoping to major in songwriting. I am prepping for the rating audition, and I am super nervous, particularly for the improv and sight reading sections. I suffer from a slight case of imposter syndrome, and I am convinced that I am going to bomb the audition and be stuck in an ensemble I hate. Any advice/reassurance would be much appreciated.",

            "comment": "Hi ! Congrats on your first year at Berklee. I totally understand your nerves. please do not stress about this rating ! Most first year  vocalists have to  take a course called ENVC - 111 Rhythm Section Grooves for Vocalists Anyways.  This course is the prereq. For most ensembles and super important to have. I  \nam a fifth semester student and I have been in a ton of ensembles that I love, not once have I had difficulty getting into an ensemble I wanted due to my rating. I even took my rating audition with bruises vocal cords so I had to switch my piece the night before !",

So maybe you\u2019ll luck out and they\u2019ll look familiar! But I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about it - even if you end up having to take an ensemble you don\u2019t love in your first semester, you\u2019ll get to choose after that.",

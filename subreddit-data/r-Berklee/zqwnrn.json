            "comment": "&gt;What can I send as supporting   \nmaterials? I've cleared performance and theory exams and would like for   \nthem to know that. Can I scan and send them or do I verbally tell them   \nduring audition/interview?\n\nAnything is fair-game, provided that it's relevant to your strengths and experiences as a musician. I'd recommend scanning the exams and uploading them as supporting materials on your application portal, and briefly mentioning that you maintain high grades in your current theory studies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Do some majors get more scholarship   \nthan others? My strength currently is playing so I think performance   \nwould be a good choice for now.\n\nWhen you're first accepted and arrive at Berklee, you don't declare your major just yet - generally it's advised that you declare for your third semester. Point being, whatever major you select will not affect the scholarship you receive from your audition/interview.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that some programs and majors do offer individual scholarships, which are generally awarded independently of the institutional ones. If you have a specific program or major in mind, let me know and I can help you find what scholarships are offered!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Lastly, Middle name isn't required, is it fine to not put it?\n\nI'd recommend entering your full name, including your middle name, anywhere where your full legal name is required. That said, once you're accepted and given OnePass credentials, you can submit a name-change request.",

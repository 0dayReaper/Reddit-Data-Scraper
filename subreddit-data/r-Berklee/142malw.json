    "postText": "Hey guys, I recently got admitted into the Spring Semester, and I\u2019m looking to major in Music Business in the future. I just have a few general questions . I\u2019m sorry if it\u2019s too long.\n\n\n1. How is the internship program at Berklee? Have any of you had any internships outside of Berklee? And would you guys think that there is a strong internship culture at Berklee like other colleges? \n\n2. How are the clubs and campus jobs at Berklee? How do you guys manage that and schoolwork?\n\n3. How to avoid getting stuck in the \u201cBerklee Bubble\u201d? \n\n4. Can Berklee\u2019s competitive nature become toxic? And how do you guys deal with that?\n\n5. Do we still have to do Ear-Training and Harmony classes after we declare our majors?\n\n6. For the guys doing majors that aren\u2019t performance or writing related, like Music Business or Music Therapy for example, when do you guys reach the stage of no longer looking for gigs and performance opportunities? \n\n7. For the Music Business Majors/Graduates, are any of you thinking of, or are currently working outside of the music industry? I know it\u2019s a counter intuitive question but I\u2019m just curious.",

                            "comment": "1. I\u2019m not totally sure about the internships, I personally don\u2019t know anyone that has taken part in their internship program which makes me think it may be a bit difficult to find them, but when you get there be sure to talk to your assigned advisor and I\u2019m sure they will have a ton of information for you. Again I don\u2019t know much so take what I say on this with a grain of salt.\n\n2. Campus jobs are solid and pay pretty well, but the waitlist is very long. It took my friend about 2 semesters to land a campus job, so be sure to put in applications as soon as you get there for your best shot. I believe they prioritize international students that don\u2019t have work visas.\n\n3. There\u2019s a ton of local DIY house shows that are a great way to meet people during the warmer months because it gets COLD and usually only berklee people go to show their support for other bands and students. If you\u2019re of drinking age there are a lot of great bars with live music to go to and cool clubs and events around town. Open mics and other stuff are a great opportunity to meet musicians outside of berklee as well.\n\n4. As long as you\u2019re with the right group it shouldn\u2019t be too competitive. I\u2019ve found students here to be very friendly and helpful for the most part, but there\u2019s def some folks that have big egos, which are people I tend to avoid.\n\n5. Depending on what level of harmony you test into, you will have to complete the different levels of harmony and ear training even after declaring a major. For example, I couldn\u2019t read music when I got to berklee, so I had to start in \u201cMusic Application and Theory\u201d and I will have to spend the next four semesters going through all four levels of harmony and ear training regardless of my major. They try to turn you into a \u201cproper\u201d musician. They will also have arranging classes and a few other mandatory classes you will have to take. It\u2019s all incredibly useful and will absolutely help you become a great musician. The classes get progressively harder, so study your ass off and try to turn your stuff in on time because it can pile up around midterms and finals. We have all found that out the hard way.\n\n6. I can\u2019t speak on this too much, but for music business majors I would say make as many connections with student AND TEACHERS. There are private instructors and teachers that have literal Grammies and have worked on platinum records. My buddy\u2019s PI won three Grammies at the Latin Grammies last year. Everyone here has the potential to be something great, but don\u2019t let that be the only reason you\u2019re nice to people. Also, very useful advice I got from an upperclassman. \u201cMake sure to know the difference between your friends and your collaborators.\u201d Also don\u2019t date in the berklee bubble. Everyone I\u2019ve met that\u2019s done it says that, and I take it to heart.\n\n7. I can\u2019t say much on this, but just keep in mind you\u2019re going to an arts college in a fairly saturated market, so make sure you\u2019re learning about what you love to do. I would say there\u2019s a good amount of opportunity for music business, but it seems like a major where I would want to secure some summer internships to build a portfolio/ resume. My parents were in the music industry for 4 decades and they said the best way to get internships is offer to be a coffee runner and sweep floors. Start from the bottom and work your way up. Being entitled will get you nowhere in this business unless you\u2019re Micheal Jackson.\n\nHope this helps! Let me know if you have more questions. Always happy to answer more :) congrats on getting in. It\u2019s gonna be a blast!",

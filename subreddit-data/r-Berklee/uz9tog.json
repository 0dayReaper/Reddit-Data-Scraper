    "postText": "I am an 2nd semester international student. I have met some issues with my summer semester check in. My English writing is not so good but I will try to be clear.\n\n\u00a0 As a result of being delayed by solving other restrictions (about health and vaccination policy), I asked for an extension\u00a0for summer semester payment. As a result of the debit card never arriving (I ordered at least 5 times and talked with the bank several times but this never appeared in the mailbox), I asked one of my trusted friends to help me with this payment.\n\n\u00a0The first payment was made around May 12?, but it was returned later after the payment restriction was automatically\u00a0removed. I asked the student account office, and got told that I need to pay again. So another payment is repeated on May 19. However, it returned\u00a0on the 25th (and as a result of payment issues,\u00a0my checking in ddl was extended\u00a0to 27th). I reached for the office of student accounts again, and was told the\u00a0reason shown here is insufficient funds. I was asked to show a bank statement that proves there is enough money.\n\n\u00a0When I sent the bank statement yesterday, the office still refused to let me check in. Instead I was told to bring a bank check, which I cannot get one very soon because I cannot reach my friend by 5pm. I went to the office for help, and got told this is an alternative payment website. After the third payment was completed and shown, I asked once more to remove my last restriction.\n\n\u00a0However, this is refused once more. The reason that the staff told me is \"payment by this account is returned twice (because of insufficient funds), and I think this time it will also be returned\". I argued that the last time payment got returned is on May 25 and I have shown on May 26 with the bank statement that there is sufficient money in that account, which is newer and stronger evidence to show that there is sufficient funds. But the staff keeps repeating that \"it is bounced twice\" regardless of my point. I am confused that why I was asked to show the bank statement when it is invalid.\n\n\u00a0But all in all it is not me who can remove that restriction. I asked if there is any alternative, and was told that \u2014\u2014 I can come with a bank check next Tuesday and the office can hopefully help. I queried how he can help when the checking in system is closed after 11:59pm today, he repeated that the office can \"hopefully help\". I cannot accept the result that it is not 100% sure that I can check in, but I have no way.\n\n Can anyone kindly tell me what should I do?",

It took a couple of days for the payments to process through the Berklee systems, but it was cheaper than the massive credit card surcharge that they apply. Hope you can sort this out.",

            "comment": "My son's Berklee tuition for Summer got lost somewhere in the mail. It was a mess, and all of the alternative payment options are confusing. However, I finally realized that I could pay it with an e-check (the option should be on the financial/billing section of your MyBerklee page, once you click on \"make a payment\"). You just supply your routing number (for paper wires) and account number for the account you're drawing the money from, and once you do that it should post to your account immediately as Paid.\nIf you've got an academic counselor, and you're not getting anywhere with the Student Accounts people, you might want to speak to him or her about the situation and get some help checking in for your classes. Is your Summer schedule still listed on MyBerklee, even though you haven't checked in yet?",

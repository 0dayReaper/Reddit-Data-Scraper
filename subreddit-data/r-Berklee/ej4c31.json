First you play a prepared piece, you can play whatever you want as long as it isn\u2019t too long. Its highly recommended that you memorize the piece. Then there is sight reading, there will be several short excerpts that you must play. You will be allowed to see the excerpts about 15 minutes from your audition when you are warming up. Then there is improv and theory/ear training. For the ear training you will be asked to sing back some melodies as well as play back rhythms on the drums. You may also be asked to identify chord qualities such as major, minor, diminished, augmented etc. I wish you the best of luck!",

            "comment": "I had been producing music for a few years before going to Berklee and was able to test out of a few of the production classes. I wanted to do MP&amp;E, and definitely had the knowledge for it, but ultimately I didn't have the grades for it. I'm a \"C's get degrees\" kind of guy. \n\nBasically keep your GPA up and study up on music production (know how to use a DAW; understand EQ, compression, reverb, etc; learn about microphones/polar patterns) and you'll be good\n\nI saw several guys get into the program without any production experience just by having good grades and studying",

Also, make friends with some current MP&amp;E majors and ask if you can shadow/assist on sessions here and there. This will give you a huge head start in learning things like signal flow/good cable practices/microphone selection and placement, etc.",

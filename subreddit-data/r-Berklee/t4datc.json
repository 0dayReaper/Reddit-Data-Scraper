    "postText": "I just moved to Massachusetts from Miami. I went to Frost at UM for jazz piano and was wondering what clubs or hangs there were here in Boston to sit in and play. Are there Berklee hangs that I could go to, even though I\u2019m not a student? Any general advice or direction is welcome too. I\u2019m just trying to play with some people and thought this would be a good place to start looking. Let me know r/Berklee.",

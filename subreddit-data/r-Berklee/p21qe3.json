I tried a lot of methods to make it cheaper including transferring credits and what not but the costs are quite tremendous. It's hard to be positive about the benefits of it. The scholarship is barely enough to really really ease my burden. I guess I'm better off than many because I get to graduate a little faster but it hurts to see my parents counting the expenses. They're old and should be relaxing and enjoying what's left of their youth.",

Only 1 of us got school paid for by my dad. My mom didn't work. But, being the youngest I was able to see the results of not going to school.  My sister was my dad's favorite.  Because when we left \nCuba she wrote my dad letters because he stayed in Cuba a little longer.  So, he always was nicer to her since. Anyway,  many of my brothers got married young and no higher education. They didn't do well financially or with children either.  Many of their kids didn't get a higher education. Basically this cycle of no education trickled down to their children. When I was in high school I got straight As most of the time.  My father didn't help me for university.  I had to join the US Army because they offered $20,000 for school if I did 4 years service. Back then (1988) tuition at Florida International University was $5,000 per year.  So this worked for me.  BUT, I had to also work to have an apartment because my dad wouldn't let me live at home even though it had two empty rooms!! I never forgot how hard it is to do well in school and work full-time to afford rent, food, a car, clothing etc. Eventually I became Mechanical Design Engineer but I was 31 when I did because I had to work. I always promised myself that when I had kids I would do anything I can to make it so they could focus on their education and hopefully not be concerned with bills paying their own way. Its just plain harder to do! I showed my daughter our financial situation ( I'm 56 now so I am 25 years in my career).  I explained that I did everything to make sure she doesn't have to miss out on the best music school in the world for contemporary music.  We make just enough to pay for her Berklee education WITHOUT LOANS of any kind. I consider myself lucky that things are ok as of this year.  There are no guarantees in this life. Next year things can change. So you should improve your chances of success by making good choices.  Talk to your parents and discuss the true financial situation with them.  Ask them if you got a few small loans (not all) if this would help ease the burden? \nI told my daughter if there is ever a problem with money I would let her know where we stand.  Family should look out for each other.  My daughter knows that my goal is for her to do better than I have done so far. I hope you figure out a way to stay at Berklee, maybe work-study or gigs around Boston, and maybe some loans. Also consider a go fund me showing videos of your performance if possible.  You'd be surprised how many people may throw some money your way. Best of luck to you and your music education and beyond.",

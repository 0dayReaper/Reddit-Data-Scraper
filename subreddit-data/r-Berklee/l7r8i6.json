I don't mean it in the sense of networking to exploit relationships. I mean getting to develop real relationships through jam sessions, hanging out, projects, etc. with lots of other people that you will help and who will help you. A few of them will turn out to be big deals in the industry, a bunch will make a living doing different things with music and you will work together over time and others will decide to do something else for a living. In any case, learn what you can, hook into the community, help others and do your best to grow!",

Colleges are graduating thousands of film scoring students and 99% will never step foot on a scoring stage, make a living composing, or work with a major composer. Everything they tell you about how competitive the industry is needs to be multiplied by 10. People move to LA and end up homeless. The lucky ones make $12.50 working for Hans Zimmer. Please don\u2019t major in film scoring.",

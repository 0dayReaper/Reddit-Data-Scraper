    "postText": "For the science course, is there a lab requirement? I\u2019m taking liberal arts courses at another college to transfer and was wondering if you had a lab with the course? At my college it\u2019s separate, and you can choose to take the course without the lab, and that\u2019s what I chose because I didn\u2019t think the lab was required, but maybe I was wrong.",

I loved it so much I transferred and now I'm a CS/music ed double major at a very nice school, paying half of berklee tuition...\n\nI'm not trying to discourage you, but just make sure that you absolutely need to do music before you transfer to berklee",

I, on the other hand, know that I wouldn\u2019t be happy doing anything other than music, so I believe Berklee is the path for me. I appreciate your reaching out, and I wish you all the success in your studies!",

It definitely saves A TON of money for the same courses. But DAMN a double major in two and a half years? That\u2019s impressive! Was it a lot of work, or did many of the classes overlap?",

    "postText": "So now I'm a graduate from Berklee. That's cool, I suppose. Since my time at the school is done, I feel it is worthwhile to catalogue my feelings on the whole experience. Apologies if the thought process jumps around, this is a rather stream-of-consciousness type writing.\n\nFirst off: Berklee is *not* a college. Period. It is a trade school, there is no question about that. \n\nThey have their liberal arts department in an attempt to replicate the broadness of a real college, but it is not nearly robust enough to warrant the title. The quality of some of the liberal arts classes I took were outstanding (such as Psychoacoustics, and Principles of Audio Electronics) but others were actively horrible (Technology, Self, and Society). The horrible class I mentioned parenthetically, TSS, was the worst course I've taken at any school - and bear in mind I was in that hellish english class at Grant Mac that was run by a feminist who hated all men. It was claimed to be a science course, one in which the professor actively stated \"I hate science,\" \"the scientific method is wrong,\" and then proceeded to prove his ignorance to anything remotely scientific over the next several months. It was an embarrassment to higher education. Sadly, that was not the only bad course I took at this school. There were a number just like it that I feel were a total waste of time. Though the quality of a number of courses were quite suspect, the ratio was probably around 1:10 for bad courses to good.\n\nThe good courses were really, really spectacular. Classes like Psychoacoustics, Cinema in Hitler's Germany, EPD classes like Sampling, Max/MSP, Jitter, Circuit Bending, and Advanced Projects (I'll come back to EPD later). Each of the courses that were truly good had one quality in common: the teachers.\n\nInarguably, the greatest quality this school has is its **teachers**. I have had the pleasure of being in classes with some of the best educators I've ever encountered (in addition to some at Grant MacEwan, and a handful at LTCHS). Susan Rogers, Michael Brigida, Neil Leonard, Loudon Stearns, Jeanine Cowen, Jeff Williams, hell - the entire EPD staff, and so many more. The majority of the teachers I've had here have been profoundly influential to my own growth, and I feel as though my life would have been far different (read: lessor) had I not met or interacted with them. I actively chat with some of these teachers as friends outside of school, and feel like they will be connections for a lifetime. I cannot emphasize enough how good the teachers here can be, and if you have an opportunity to take classes with some of the best - do not miss your opportunity to do so.\n\nWith that being said, there are some other things I feel need to be mentioned.\n\nThe **campus sucks**. A lot. It is worth noting that I'm talking about this without having been able to make use of the new building; but for my entire experience here, I've actively disliked being in the school. There are no truly quiet places to sit and study, because there is not enough space to do so. The school is built into the city, which for some may be cool; but I often found myself going to other schools like MIT and NEU to make use of their libraries. With that being said, the quality of stuff within the campus is quite good - the studios have high quality equipment, the stages are impressive, and the classrooms are generally well equipped; but, again, it doesn't feel like a college. A bit of a non-sequitur, but one really good thing about the campus and school, though: the **clubs**. **Video Game Music Club** and **Sound Design Network** were the ones I mainly associated with (though I wasn't able to attend them for the past few terms &lt;/3), and they are up there with the best parts of this school.\n\nThe social environment generally sucks. When you get thousands of music students together in one area, the idea may be novel to some; but I found it tiring. No-one needs to see the group of thirty kids smoking weed outside of 150 on a wednesday morning, playing their guitars with their portable amps in the street, generally being loud and annoying. Droves of people walking down the street screaming for seemingly no reason, people blaring trumpets in your ears as you're trying to cross the street, et cetera. Perhaps I'm a cranky old man; but after a while, it gets to be too much. \n\nAlright, here is what I feel is the most important part of what I'm writing.\n\nThe part of this school that makes all the difference is the **major** you choose. I personally feel as though I can say whether or not you should come here directly based on the major you want to take.\n\nI'll start with the major(s) I have experienced.\n\n**Electronic Production &amp; Design** is the major I graduated from, and it is a combination of music composition, computer science, technology studies, and (with the path I took) bits of electrical engineering thrown in. I found it to be really valuable, and I enjoyed basically every class I've taken in the major. There is a ton of freedom with the path you want to take, as there are only a few 'required' courses - everything else that you take is specifically what you're interested in. It's prepared me really well for my next ventures, which is mainly working in the video game industry. I recommend EPD to anyone who asks, and will continue to do so well past graduation.\n\n**Contemporary Writing &amp; Production** is the second major I was enrolled in (did both CWP and EPD at the same time for several terms). Again, the teachers I had in this major were great; but I didn't like the classes, nor did I like the structure. The classes you were required to take were very ridged and provided little wiggle room for stuff you were interested in. The major is supposed to focus on both technology and composition, but I felt it never went far enough in either direction. It talked about both of them in a cursory manner, and it was disappointing. I ended up dropping CWP and going purely for EPD. For some this major may be perfect, but for me it wasn't enough.\n\nNow come the opinion parts which I'm basing on experience with friends and their stories, not personal experiences.\n\n**Film Scoring** seems to be a strong major. It generally seems agreed that the first half of film scoring is weaker than the second, but that the second is really valuable. A lot of the work that I've seen come out of the film scoring major has been really high quality, and I'm positive that a lot (if not most) of the people graduating from the major will find some kind of work. \n\n**Music Education** and **Music Therapy** are two majors I'm not overly familiar with, but it seems like the people I know who take classes in them enjoy it a lot. I feel like both of these majors provide you a ton of opportunities in the future. Music Therapy is something that is on the up-and-up, especially if you take the time to teach yourself some technology skills. I feel like if someone takes Music Therapy and also learns something like Max/MSP, they could do some really cool things. As for Education, teachers will always be required. If the quality of education Music Ed students are getting is sufficient, I'd like to see how their time in a classroom fairs - I'm sure it would be great =)\n\n**MP&amp;E** is good. Great teachers, great studios. Nothing much to say other than if you want to do recording with analog equipment, it is a great major.\n\nI don't have enough experience with **Comp** or **Jazz comp** to give an educated opinion.\n\nAlright, let's get negative.\n\n**Music Business** seems like something that doesn't belong at this school. I understand how it applies to the real world, and I get that a lot of graduates find work managing bands and stuff; but I just think it's a poor major. I had a roommate for a few years who was a music business major, and having looked at the notes &amp; assignments he was doing, it seemed weird to me. Yes, education in copyright law and the like happens; but if I were someone in a band who is looking for someone to manage us, I'm going to look for someone with more credentials than a music business degree from Berklee. What they learn is so segmented from the rest of law. Sure they can tell you about what unions to join and how to properly copyright your song, but I don't trust that they could tell you about anything too far outside of the music industry. Also, a lot of music business majors seem to hate coming to Berklee because they still have to take classes like Ear Training and Harmony - which they (quite vocally) express no interest in. I feel like if you are interested in this, you'd be better off attending a school of law and focus specifically on the music industry while there.\n\n**Songwriting**. Seriously, to me, it is one of the weakest majors one could be in. I apologize if you're reading this and are a current songwriting major, but I am of the opinion that if you are wanting to do songwriting for the rest of your life, that you should just do it. I don't feel like anyone I've seen who has gone through the major has greatly gained anything from it. The stuff they wrote after graduating basically sounded like what they wrote before - now they just have a bachelor of music to give it some credibility. That's just my opinion though, if anyone has further comments on this feel free to send me a message or leave a comment.\n\n**Performance**. Okay, here comes the major rant. \n\nGetting a degree in performance is a mistake. I went through a performance program, and though I enjoyed it at the time, found it to be largely worthless to me in the long run. I know that is not the case for everyone, and some of the people I graduated with from that performance program continue to perform (and are quite successful, congrats friends) but - to me - it sealed in the fact that contemporary performance in higher education is nigh worthless. The classes are literally having you practice, learn songs, and perform. You don't need to go to college to do this. In fact, I feel like people may actually be less inclined to hire you if you get a performance degree. If you want to perform, you would be much, MUCH better served by just going out there and doing it. Everything you learn in a performance major is taught much quicker, and much harsher from actual performance. You gain next to nothing from doing it in a college setting. \n\nWith that being said, there are arguments to be made for some instruments and some genres to get this kind of education. My friend who's taking Marimba with the intent of working in an orchestra? I totally get that, and that is completely valid. Orchestras want to see that you've taken your education seriously, and likely won't even consider applicants who don't have some form of college/university training in performance. That makes sense, 100% - but if you're the type that is looking to play in a rock band for the rest of your life, just no. What benefits would you be getting from this education? Harmony classes and ear training? Maybe. Private lesson? Sure, but you don't need college to do that. Labs and ensembles? Why not just use the stuff you'd do in labs and practice that on your own time? Ensembles? Start your own and actually get gigs instead of being forced to attend a class every week. I mean, hell, you don't even really get to choose who you're playing with in these ensembles!  In the real world, you're likely going to want even the slightest amount of agency of who you're playing with if you're in a rock, pop, country, or whatever band. Of course there are the cases of playing a cruise ship gig or whatever which won't leave you any choice, but I still feel like you don't need a degree to do that. The bottom line is if you are considering this school for a performance degree, maybe take a step back and really think about what that will do for you once you graduate. \n\nBerklee is a weird place. I feel like it does some things really right (teachers, some majors like EPD, MP&amp;E, Film Scoring, et cetera) but it really drops the ball in other regards (Campus, being a \"college,\" et cetera). I realize that I may seem quite critical and negative, and I apologize for the cynicism. Outside of school, the past two years have been extremely bad for me on a personal level - the worst I've had, really. There's no reason to get into the details here, but I do realize that my poor experiences in my personal life may have influenced my opinions here. Regardless, I hope this proves to be of value to someone =)\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this, and I definitely appreciate any feedback!\n\nThanks again  \n-Alex",

            "comment": "As a side-comment, for those interested in how I ended up going to Berklee, here's some super quick background information. I first attended Grant MacEwan University in Edmonton, where I also studied music - performance (bass) specifically. Graduated, got a scholarship to Berklee, worked for about 2 years to afford living &amp; remaining tuition, and moved on down. \n\nFrom Grant Mac, transfer credits were easy, but also distributed in a strange way. Ear training was totally transferred, 3 out of 4 harmony classes came over, all of the ensemble credits transferred (but they still forced me to take one), none of the private instruction credits came over, and most of the liberal arts ones did (except semester 1 english for some reason, had to take that again). So the credit transfer process wasn't necessarily bad, but kind of inconsistent with regards to my expectations. \n\nThis one is unrelated to Berklee, but being an international student sucks. Jumping through all of the hoops for an i-20 is annoying, and it seems as though getting a hold of an OPT or work visa will be even worse. Thankfully, once it's done all you have to do is live in the states, so that isn't so bad; but getting to that point kind of blows.",

It was stuck several decades in the past as the leadership wasn't the best. I do have hopes for the future though, as the new head of the department is making some amazing adjustments and is actually caring about what the students want to learn. They're focusing more on what kind of music will be coming out in the next year and how you can set yourself apart from the out of date stuff on the radio right now. The major has been stuck in a limbo for many years and it's nice to finally see some progress being made. Sadly I graduated right as all of these changes were taking place. Bashing the major aside, I'm glad I did songwriting and wouldn't have wanted to study anything else. I had a lot of fun and wrote a ton of songs. I came to Berklee having never written a song before and left having written 237. If you really want to get technical, you can learn every single thing in every major online. It all comes down to what you decide to learn outside of classes and through the experiences you have.",

I wouldn't be able to add anything to them by reiterating.\n\nThough I agree with your perception of the school mainly being set up for the performers/songwriters in mind, I still think the school would benefit from more space in general. I have a few friends who I regularly hang out with, both of whom are performance majors. They both enjoy the school for the rehearsal spaces and performance venues; but when it comes to their other classes, ones which require reading and writing, they also actively avoid going to the school. They usually end up at NEU's library, or my apartment to write &amp; study. \n\nYou're totally right with the student body, as well. For sure, peoples' experiences will vary depending on how they interact with others, and having us all share the same general major means there's some commonality there. The thing about other educational institutes is that when you're walking around, there is opportunity to interact with people who have a completely different area of interest from your own. I find that super valuable, because you're able to avoid being saturated by your own area of study. Having a chat with an engineer and a psychology major about cats and pie is great, simply because you don't have that common ground to fall back on. You won't start talking about ii-V's and stuff, you'll just have human interaction.\n\nWith your last point, I feel like you're approaching one of the biggest problems with the school that I have had a hard time putting into words.\n\nI feel as though a lot of people apply &amp; attend this school simply for the name, without considering what they will do once they graduate. They look at it and say \"it's an entire school dedicated to music, how rad is that?\" but they neglect to think about the quality of education they are receiving. They have the perspective, which you so aptly identified, of almost guaranteeing their own success just because they are attending the school. None of that is necessarily true, but it is what is communicated to everyone who is applying. I feel it's both the school and the students fault; but, at the same time, neither's. It is, like you said, how you as a student spend your time here. If you choose to never interact with another person, never expend any effort on projects, nor ever plan for your future - you will fail. If you do even one of these things, though - the resources the school has to offer will benefit you. Especially the teachers, as well as the other students around you who share the same ambitions that you do.\n\nIt's a complicated thing, and I'm glad the discussion is open (=\n",

That school was far harsher than anything I encountered at Berklee (though, perhaps with your performance program parts were harsh) and if you messed up it was your own fault haha.\n\nIt's very much a Your Mileage May Vary situation, and there's definitely a ton of merit in the performance program if you take advantage of it (= Sorry if you took any of what I was saying as a slight against it!",

            "comment": "agreed. majoring in performance is dumb as fuck. i did it, and i regret it completely. i wish i could have done pro music and i would have taken the classes i was actually interested in. plus nothing sucks the joy out of music like a bunch of old, out dated unenlightened, pretentious, almost famous people who think they're the shit just cuz they teach at berklee\n",

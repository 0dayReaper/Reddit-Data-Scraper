    "postText": "Im 17 and currently a junior in hs, and i\u2019ve always wanted to play the drums since i was a kid but sadly only picked them up at 16 due to my family not being able to afford lessons or a kit. I absolutely adore music and its pretty much my life, but im fairly new to actually playing. I was wondering if anyone here got in with only 1.5-3 years of experience, and what attending is like when you\u2019re that inexperienced. I\u2019m willing to spend every possible waking hour practicing since playing music is pretty much the only way i can imagine being happy with my life. Thanks for the help !!",

As of now im taking piano lessons because im aware of how important it is, and even though its quite the late start im willing to dedicate everything to it. Sadly my school doesnt have drum corps or even band so drum set and piano are pretty much the only things available for me to get experienced with. Thank you ao much for the kind words and the help!! And congrats on all the accomplishments you mentioned it sounds like you\u2019re an absolutely incredible musician lol",

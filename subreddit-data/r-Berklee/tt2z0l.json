If you can't put up with the load of work, and still like working on music, you might as well work on music at your own pace and save hundreds of thousands of dollars",

I'm in my sixth semester and I work  hard to understand all the materials (You don't have to get great grades. You just have to Have a great understanding of the class material) ... It is not easy, especially core music But I worked with tutors in the beginning, now I am in upper level Harmony classes and things are much better now !",

He applied to (and was accepted at) a lot of different music programs, but Berklee is the only one that offered the classes/major he is interested in (film/media scoring), varied performance opportunities (other programs were only classical or jazz), and being surrounded by other musicians with whom he could geek out about music theory, etc.",

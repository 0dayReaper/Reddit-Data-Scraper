All I owe berklee is this course to compete my bachelors of music (the bulk of my studies were between 2003 and 2006 so it has been a while). what is this course like? how intensive is it? for some reason they presented me this option to enroll today but said I need to make a decision by tomorrow and I have no info about what the course is like. Thank you so much !",

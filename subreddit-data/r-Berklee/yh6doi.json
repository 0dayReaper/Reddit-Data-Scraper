Or does my school send them in with my transcript?\n\nI\u2019m applying for the November 1st deadline, so any help ASAP is greatly appreciated!",

Also one of my recommenders is the founder of a studio I interned at so how do I get his LOR to them? I have a copy of it and was wondering if I could just attach it to my supplemental materials.",

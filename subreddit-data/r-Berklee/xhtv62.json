    "postText": "hi everyone! I'm a transfer student looking to study music production &amp; engineering at Berklee next fall, but I've played violin since I was a kid and was classically trained. I know that Berklee is geared more towards contemporary music, which is what i ultimately want to focus on, but what angle should I take with regards to my audition piece selection? Would they appreciate seeing something composed more recently, or something outside of the neoclassical umbrella altogether? Or should i focus on the type of music that I'm most experienced with? Also, are string musicians required to do the same improvisation as more-jazz oriented musicians? I'd appreciate any insights that you think are relevant to my situation! Thanks in advance.",

            "comment": "Best practice is to play something you know well and that highlights your specific strengths as a musician. People come from all sorts of backgrounds and play in all sorts of ways, so the auditioner(s) won\u2019t be looking for any specific style or genre. \n\nAs for what goes into your audition, it would be much the same regardless of your instrument - you\u2019ll have a your prepared piece, some sight-reading exercises, ear training exercises, and an improv section. There\u2019s probably minor changes depending on the instrument, so if you\u2019re super unsure it may be best to call the Admissions Office at (617) 747-2221. \n\n(PS - if you\u2019re super worried about improv in the audition, don\u2019t be - I CRIED on the sight-reading section of my exam and got in with a scholarship - it helps that the other parts of my exam were pretty good, but still\u2026)",

The string department gets a lot of people in that same boat who are classically trained and haven\u2019t had much experience in other music but want to study more contemporary styles.\n\nThere are great recourses for this once you get to school so don\u2019t sweat it for the audition! Good luck!",

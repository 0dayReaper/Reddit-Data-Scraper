    "postText": "Hi guys,\n\nI'm planning on spending my Fall 2023 semester in Valencia, so I will be needing to sublet my apartment in Boston.  I am living in a 4-bedroom apartment with 3 really sweet friends.  We have a huge kitchen and pantry with exposure to natural light.  The apartment building has a rooftop patio that is really nice to spend time on during the summer and fall.  The security in the building is top notch as every public door in the building has a different code ensuring that no randos get in.  There are multiple laundry units in the basement of the building.\n\nThe apartment is located on Fenway street, 2 mins from 98 Hemenway dorms, 10 mins from Berklee Campus and 5 mins from Northeastern.\n\nmy bedroom comes with a queen-sized bed mattress, table, carpets, couch, a fan, and a lot of closet space.\n\nThe rent is around $1400/month including WIFI and Electricity/Heat\n\nPlease email me at: [mprompatanapak@berklee.edu](mailto:mprompatanapak@berklee.edu) for more information\n\nor hit me up on Instagram at: mtthewmusic",

    "postText": "My son auditioned on piano (and was accepted with a partial scholarship). The main reason he chose piano is that he was already preparing piano auditions for other schools that required a classical instrument for a composition major (he will be doing either composition or film scoring). However, he has more years experience on electric bass and guitar.  Once he comes to Berklee, is anything determined by the instrument he auditioned on? Not sure how it works.  Thanks!",

            "comment": "To my knowledge, it means that your son is a piano principal and is required to take 4 semesters of private lessons on the piano (6 for Music Education major and 8 for Performance major).  In an ensemble class, your son may be required to only play the piano part, of course this can depend on the professor, class size, type of ensemble, etc.  There is a form that allows you to change your principal instrument but I was told and saw on the form that it may change your scholarship.  You can also declare a secondary instrument, but it would require another audition but rather than on the piano it would be on the bass or guitar.  Outside of class like clubs that has a band, he can play whatever instrument.  Something nice about being a piano principal is that you don't need to take the Basic Keyboard Techniques class which is required for Composition and Film Scoring majors.",

            "comment": "He played a jazz piece on the piano, I'm not sure which one, and submitted some of his compositions.  He taught himself piano a couple of years ago, and has been in private lessons for just a few months. He applied Early Action, so his audition was back in November, and we didn't know much at all about scholarships, which instruments were more in demand, etc. Honestly, I was worried that by choosing piano he wouldn't get in, because it's his least experienced instrument. But he's a very musical kid, as everyone at Berklee is I assume :), a total theory nerd, and really well rounded in musical styles (jazz, rock, classical, etc.), so I assume that the interview portion of the audition went really well even if his playing wasn't as technically perfect as it should be. Sounds like if he had auditioned on bass he might have gotten a bigger scholarship!\n\nHe's happy to continue to take piano lessons at Berklee (prefers that over taking bass lessons) but he's never played piano as part of an ensemble, only bass, guitar, or drums. Maybe he can look into declaring bass as a secondary instrument if he wants to do that.",

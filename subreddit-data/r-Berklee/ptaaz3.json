    "postText": "I'm self-taught, got to a decent point where I could shred fast pentatonics with hammer-ons and pull-offs, e.g., almost all Metallica solos, but I got stuck as I tried to move forward with harder stuff like Megadeth, Pantera, Steve Vai, Joe Satriani type of stuff.\n\nI tried to keep self-teaching myself with books and YouTube but the lack of direction and specific lessons addressing my weaknesses stalled my growth.\n\nI am looking for an instructor that would guide me in improving my technique.\n\nA bit more about myself - non-guitar related: I am an international student, pursuing my PhD in electrical engineering, recently arrived in Cambridge. I am open to commuting to many places that the instructor resides, I am fully vaccinated.",

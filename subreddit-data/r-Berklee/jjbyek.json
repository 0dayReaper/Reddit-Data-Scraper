Apartment life can be a bit isolating. Plus, being on campus means you've got a 5 minute walk to class, as opposed to the hour long ride on the Green Line in the winter like so many Berklee students have from Allston.",

            "comment": "It depends on who you are in my opinion. If you are a person who struggles with social skills and making friends or you're nervous about it, I would live on campus. Obviously this year with the pandemic it definitely makes it more complicated. For example, finding a roommate who complies with how you handle the pandemic is obviously an issue. Although if you are confident that you won't have problems making friends and have a reliable roommate, I think living off campus is the move because you have so much more freedom than living in dorms, but it also comes with its own issues such as maintenance, being close enough to school and whether or not you can get a lease that you are ok with. It is just a matter of what you value more or less.",

But the MOST valuable thing you'll get out of Berklee is the connections you make with people. Being there, eating in the caf, hanging out late nights in common rooms and stuff, it's all part of that.",

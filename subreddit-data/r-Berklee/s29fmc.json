    "postText": "So my audition at Berklee is February 11th. I\u2019m singing, I\u2019m traditionally a classical singer so I will be singing an aria, but quite a few people have told me that unless I was auditioning for BOCO classical may not be what Berklee would want to see at an audition. I\u2019ve applied to study music production (a passion of mine for the past few years) and I\u2019m worried these mix matched abilities are going to ruin my chances of getting in. Should I change my song or stick to my original idea?",

            "comment": "I auditioned way back in 2004, and I was classically trained as well (I went pop and had plans to always which is why I chose Berklee, but classical training and musical theater were the only kinds of vocal training offered where I grew up).  I, too, auditioned with one aria and a more pop-aligned song, and got in!  I also ended up helping audition prospective students back in LA for some years post-graduation, and what I was told we were looking for really is the existing talent and potential, not necessarily the song choice.  That said, I don't recall how many pieces you audition with because it's been so long, but if possible I would have a more popular music-oriented song to contrast your versatility.\n\nNot sure how helpful this is, but best of luck!",

            "comment": "When I worked as a student employee in the admissions office, we were always told to advise prospective students to perform whatever they felt most comfortable &amp; confident with, that showed off both their technical skill and personal taste/style. If that's an aria, that's what you should do! They are interested in you as a whole artist/person and I really don't think it will be an issue that your audition piece and intended major don't necessarily \"match\" - if anything, I think it may do the opposite and demonstrate something that is unique about you and your artistry.",

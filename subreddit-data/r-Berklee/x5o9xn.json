Tuition is only $46,000 of that. The remainder consists of fees and living expenses. The cost of room and board off campus is already inaccurate as it assumes you\u2019ll spend $18,000 on both, which comes to $1,500. You\u2019d be lucky to find just the room for that price, and then you still have to buy your food or eat on the meal plan.",

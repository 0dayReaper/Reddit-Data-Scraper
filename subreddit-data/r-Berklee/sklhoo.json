For more info, I offer course counselling/planning services to help people fast track!\n\n2 years is the hypothetical bare minimum as you need to take at least 60 credits at Berklee to graduate.\n\nYou have to:\n\n1.\tBefore starting, do 21 credits of CLEP exams (study with [modernstates.org](https://modernstates.org)). College Composition is a must, I also did American History 1, Analyzing/Interpreting Literature, Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, Sociology, and Precalculus. Acquaint yourself with the transfer credit office webpage, they\u2019ll be your friend.\n2.\tTeach yourself the Core Music classes through the textbooks before taking the entering theory placement tests. I tested out of MAT, Harmony 2, Arranging 1, Ear Training 1-3, and Tonal Harmony 1 and 2.\n3.\tLook for other CBX/course test-out opportunities that are for your major (CWP offers many, I tested out of Basic Keyboard 1, Sequencing and Production Techniques, and Groove Writing). You can test out of harmony classes, conducting, counterpoint, and quite a few others!\n4.\tTake Berklee Online for the liberal arts classes that can\u2019t be done easily through transfer credits (Art History, Acoustics, Music and Society, History of Film Music)\n5.\t16 credits per semester is generally a necessity. For performance, there are 8 levels of PI, I placed out of the first one and took one in the summer as a part time student.",

Please take advantage of that resource, if you approach them after doing some basic homework they will be able to help, and have access to the most updated information to ensure you\u2019re plan will work.

            "comment": "It REALLY depends on your intended major. Some majors have very strict course tracts. You have to go into this process knowing exactly what you want. I 1000% appreciate the financial concerns, know that part of Berklee\u2019s magic is the proximity and ability to explore many different parts of the music field. I believe attaining this experience requires a certain openness and freedom - it doesn\u2019t require 4 years, but it does require a mindset that enables someone to take advantage of everything which can be challenging when your hyper focused on very specific courses. \n\nI was there for 4 years and STILL didn\u2019t manage to take advantage of that as much as I could have because I was focused on doing the major I went there for + getting good grades. \n\nIt\u2019s really important to know why Berklee (specifically Boston Campus) and make sure you\u2019ll actually be able to get that. Otherwise there are other options that could suit your needs better.",

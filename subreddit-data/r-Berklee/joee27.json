    "postText": "Hi, I have my audition for Berklee on the 10th of December for guitar and currently I'm playing Wonderful Slippery Thing by Guthrie Govan, as well as a short jazz arrangement of Someday my Prince will Come. I mostly play jazz and neo-soul guitar. I'm pretty nervous for the audition and I'm wondering if any fellow guitarist could give me some tips or recommend any pieces in a jazz or neo-soul style?",

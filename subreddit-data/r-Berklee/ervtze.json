    "postText": "I have an audition coming up in about a month and was wondering what are the chances of getting a full scholarship to Berklee. Anybody know anyone that got in with a scholarship, what they played for their audition, did they nail absolutely every part of the audition, like what do you need to do to get a scholarship? I'm going to be playing Peaches En Regalia - Frank Zappa for my audition.",

Yea, you're going to need to nail it 110% and then some. But if ever applicant does that, it doesn't mean they'll give full scholarships to every student. Berklee doesn't have much money compared to places like Harvard, etc... there's not that many full scholarships. You can read more about the programs on their website. \n\nI can confidently say it doesn't matter what you play, but how you play it. You're really just going to have to do it and hope for the best.",

            "comment": "Hi, i just got in with a 11k scholarship. \n\nTo be honest, i wasn\u2019t sure i\u2019d get accepted at all - scholarship or not. I did my best at the audition but i for sure didn\u2019t nail every part. Some parts were good. Some were worse. For example i kinda failed when they gave me some jazz chords (quite complicated ones) to sight read in tempo. I was really nervous and couldn\u2019t play them very well.\n\nEven though, that didn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s true when you hear that they seek potential and determined people. You don\u2019t have to nail every part and you don\u2019t have to play like Chick Corea or Hiromi. After all, it\u2019s still a school you want to get in. A place where you go to learn to do these things.\n\nSo in my opinion. You should be able to show them that you know your music and that you love doing it and you\u2019re eager to learn more. That\u2019s what they\u2019re looking for.\n\nFor my prepared piece i played the final piano solo part of Mehladu\u2019s \u201cBlackbird\u201d and then Chick Corea\u2019s \u201cBlues for Art\u201d with some of my own improv included.\n\nAlso i\u2019m sure that the supplemental materials do a lot as well. If you have any written sheet music, your own written and/or produced songs, any achievements such as music school contests or so - Show them. They like to see you can do more things. \n\nGood luck!\n\nEDIT: Getting full scholarship is possible but the chances are very low. They give it to like 7 people every year. I know it sounds amazing but maybe don\u2019t focus on in that much because you might end up being way more nervous at the audition because you won\u2019t want to fail any part. \n\nFirst of all, enjoy it and have fun. Show them what you\u2019re the best at and you\u2019ll see.",

                    "comment": "I didn\u2019t submit any supplemental materials besides a resume, is that particularly bad for my application? I don\u2019t understand how to produce music, although I\u2019m somewhat present at writing music (lyrics). I was in the choir, which was mentioned within the resume, but my experience isn\u2019t the greatest. \n\nI am extraordinarily shy, and that was evident throughout the audition and interview, and I\u2019m hoping they won\u2019t see that as a negative but they might. I also let them know of my nerves after the performance, by showing the camera that my hand is shaking, and they let me get some water. I let them know of my nerves twice, because I was becoming lightheaded and needed to drink water, but they might see that as bad. I didn\u2019t apologise about being nervous, luckily. I also started developing itchiness on my neck, and I itched my neck in the worst way possible. It was done in the \u2018slit throat\u2019 gesture, and I am biting my tongue when looking back on it. I also don\u2019t know anything about sight reading. I don\u2019t think I will get in... \n\nWith the scholarships, I think there are two forms of \u2018full\u2019 scholarships: there\u2019s the full-tuition scholarship and the full scholarship which includes the room, which is given to 7 students per year.",

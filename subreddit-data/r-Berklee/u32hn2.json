    "postText": "Hi! I'm in an international student at Berklee, and realized that if I'm able to take liberal arts courses in another (read \"cheaper\") college, I might be able to shave off an entire semester, thus saving my sponsors a lot of money. Does anyone have experience doing this, who could recommend a college? I've looked at Roxbury, UMass and others, but I'm wondering if someone could share their experience as to be better informed. Thank you in advance!",

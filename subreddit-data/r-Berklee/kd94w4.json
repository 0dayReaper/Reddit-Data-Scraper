All the other schools I applied for I got into and got some really good scholarships from them, I didn\u2019t get one to Berklee though, but even without a scholarship I\u2019m leaning towards Berklee. So I\u2019m just simply asking for your experiences and opinions on Berklee, if you can provide feedback on things you like or dislike about Berklee, this is all stuff that will help me determine where I should go. Thanks so much!",

I would say it is really worth the experience if you can actually connect not only online but more face to face with the musicians of your own type. It is a bit more difficult online as it is very hard to be part of a band/ensemble or to connect with your peers through private lessons as those are definitely the main core of Berklee. In terms of other classes (you own major), it is definitely rewarding if you decide to put in the effort and also dig further and deeper and also trying to make the most out of each assignment/project. If you just decide to get a decent grade and get a piece of paper, I would say go to other music college. Classes wise is okay, but the experience of connecting with your peers is definitely best thing that can happen to you and it is hella worth it! In terms of what I feel Berklee is lacking is that once you are in a group or your own it is really hard to get out of it and enter another group, so I would say go around and make as many friends as possible and maintain those connections. Hopefully this helps and good luck with everything! Feel free to PM me for anything more and I would love to help out!",

Some of the the main questions would be I guess did you enjoy attending there, were there any aspects of Berklee you liked, and/or aspects you didn\u2019t like? That\u2019s awesome they opened a lot of doors for you, and if you want to answer, how did they help provide those opportunities for you? Thanks so goddamn much!!",

I chose to major in Contemporary Writing and Production so the experiences were the kind of things I never thought possible prior (writing, arranging, and conducting for choirs, big band, orchestras). Received formal training in composing and producing while meeting crazy talented people every day (which eventually rubs off).\n\nPost Berklee I moved to Nashville, started a pro touring band, got to arrange and perform with the Nashville symphony...,if I\u2019m not on the road, I\u2019m working in my home studio writing and recording. Music is a *tough tough hustle* and I\u2019ve been accused of being a perfectionist/workaholic but CWP has given me skills beyond just being a guitarist to earn a living and even support starting a family. \n\nHappy to connect and talk more via DM if you have more specific questions.",

Depending on what subgenres you enjoy, I\u2019ve found it can be very hard to meet like-minded players.  With that said, even the pre-determined intro courseload has been valuable to me, and potential for meaningful connection and musical development is evident in spite of the online learning.  \n\nIf your ultimate goal is to play metal music on your own terms in your own band, Berklee is very much a gamble.  You will have to stretch a bit to apply your experiences to your genre of choice, but if you\u2019re not in a position to take on overwhelming debt and open minded, I believe there\u2019s a lot to gain.",

Appreciate the response, happy it has been valuable to you so far! Thanks again so much for the input, it\u2019s really helpful. Also I saw your Insta, Just followed it mine is damage__ink. And hey if I do end up going to Berklee maybe we can jam or some shit eventually. Thanks again!",

Older students are welcome to correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I\u2019d say you\u2019re in a good position there.  All of Boston is accessible to you if you attend so I wouldn\u2019t sweat it too much, just felt like throwing out a disclaimer that the scene is small.",

                    "comment": "Thank you so much for all this input, this is extremely helpful. I\u2019m sorry you had to deal discouragement like that. And yes my dream definitely is to be a metal guitarist. I would go for Music Performance and minor in production. Obviously I\u2019d try get an internship when I\u2019m there and get a job, and eventually try to get a job at a studio and put use to that minor in production as it is genuinely something I love doing, as over the quarantine I made a solo album and really got into production. As for guitar and performance I\u2019ve been into that for about 9 years. While I have a job I\u2019d be hoping to find a band and get a career in a band going. \n\nAnd that\u2019s the thing I can say I\u2019m going to do all of this, and I am extremely determined, but you just never know what is going to happen. As the music industry from my tiny experience of it, and from what others say, is goddamn tough and it seems to be unpredictable. Luckily some of my family is helping pay for a lot of the expenses of whatever college I do attend, but that doesn\u2019t just magically take away the cost of Berklee as it\u2019s fucking $200k!! So yea money is a big factor. I think what intrigues me about Berklee (besides being my dream school for years) is that my guitar teacher went there, and the fact that (I hope) I\u2019ll have a connection with the students, as many will have the same interests as me I imagine, and the fact the connections Berklee has and where it is located as well.",

    "postText": "My daughter is attending Berklee Aspire for the first time this summer. I was looking at the list of what to bring and it said:\n\n\"Two clean copies of solo music you are prepared to perform and work on with coaches and teachers (this must be a full piano/vocal score and not a chart). If you are a musical theater singer, please be sure that at least two of these pieces are true to style.\"\n\nShe is going to be a vocal student so I was just curious as to what she should bring. Should it be songs she wrote herself or are songs she enjoys singing okay?",

            "comment": "Unless she has written out full scores for her original songs, like they\u2019re asking for, it would be better to bring songs that the sheet music is available for. What styles of music/artists does she most enjoy singing? It can be hard to find full scores for popular music sometimes, so she may be a little bit limited by what\u2019s available.",

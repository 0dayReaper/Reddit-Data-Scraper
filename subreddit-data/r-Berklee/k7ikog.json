    "postText": " \n\n \n\nTL;DR, if I can do it, you can stop stressing. \n\n Okay everyone is right, it's honestly not as bad as you think it's going to be. I've been singing seriously since I was around 10 but never got the opportunity or could afford lessons or anything until I got a job so I was super afraid of the sight singing. I killed myself rehearsing and still made some small mistakes but I think the most challenging thing is getting out of your own head.\n\n  I waited in the lobby until 10 min after my written down time and joined an audition room where I got asked what I was pursuing potentially at berklee and the dreaded question: \"how many years have you been taking vocal lessons?\" I don't really think they cared about it as much as I did but it was my prepared piece and then I did like all the technical stuff. I messed up on one of the chord identifying bits but kinda recovered and got it together for the sight reading. I kinda feel weird about the improv, I'm friends with lots of rappers and have been learning to freestyle a little bit with my singing but I can't tell if it translated well.  They beamed me back into the main room after that and only waited a couple min for my interview!\n\n  The interview is pre straight forward, just look over the questions :) I'm the type of person who kinda needs to think a while and talks way to much and the person I was talking to was really nice:)",

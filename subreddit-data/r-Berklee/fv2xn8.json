    "postText": "Hey folks,\n\nI finally have got through the admissions process, and now I\u2019m waiting for the financial aid award. On the NetPartner webpage, it is said that my CSS Profile is received. Moreover, they even created another document and said that it is for some administrative purposes.\nAnd now I\u2019m wondering: in any case, they would send me a letter, wouldn\u2019t they?\n\nSo, has any of you got the financial aid decision? And what you think of it \u2014 are they generous or not really?\n\nP. S.: you know, that fact of giving need-based aid is fairly new for Berklee, so I couldn\u2019t find anything about it on the web, that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking you :) I",

I wanted to call them today, but I missed the time \u2013 I will definitely do it tomorrow.\n\nAnd the strange part: on Berklee Financial Aid website it is said \"If an international student wishes to be considered for need-based institutional funds and is entering at Berklee College of Music, they should complete the [CSS profile](https://cssprofile.collegeboard.org/) using Berklee's school code: 3107.\" But my admissions officer said me: \"Please keep in mind that international students are not eligible for financial aid at Berklee, CSS profile is meant to collect info on your behalf.\"\n\nAnd now I'm feeling terribly confused.",

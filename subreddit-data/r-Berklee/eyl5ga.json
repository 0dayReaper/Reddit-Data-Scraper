    "postText": "So I got a provisional acceptance, stating that I was missing necessary documents for full admission. I emailed the enrollment officer and sent my transcripts over and this morning, I got email saying \"Board of Admissions on a rolling basis from now. We will notify you when you have a final decision.\" Has anybody had a similar experience with admissions? I'd hate to have thought that I got in then later find out that wasn't the case.",

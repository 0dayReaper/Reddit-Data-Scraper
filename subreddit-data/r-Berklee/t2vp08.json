It took them an inordinate amount of time to process my transcripts as well so I'm sure that they're just overloaded right now \u2013 I'm just anxious.",

They\u2019re general - why do you want to go to the program? What will you contribute to the school?\n\nThe last question is a short essay, which you\u2019ll have five minutes to type. For me, it involved picking a social issue that was important to me.",

Be prepared to answer questions about your mixes - I specifically was asked about how I produce vocals and drums, and was asked to walk the interviewer (who at the time was the head of the program) through my vocal chain pretty comprehensively. After that, we talked about why the program would be a good fit for me and what I as a person would bring to the cohort.\n\nIt lasted 30-40 minutes for me - I think we ran overtime geeking out about Valhalla plugins. I got in and am halfway through the program at this point, so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

    "postText": "How did you guys afford your first year at Berklee? Especially internatonal students from Europe, specifically SERBIA? Did you apply for any specific scholarship/grant, or reach out to an individual or company? Any information would be helpful, as I am running out of resources, and have had zero success lately. I've reached out to many different companies, and I dont know of any scholarships I could apply to. I received a 14,000$ scholarship, but that doesnt seem like much right now, because I need so much more to afford going.\n\nTldr: Serbian students at Berklee, how did you afford your first year? I need advice, resources, names of companies/individuals, anything would be helpful :)",

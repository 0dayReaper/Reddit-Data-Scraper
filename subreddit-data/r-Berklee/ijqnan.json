I was honestly shocked I got in using this song seeing how everyone else in this reddit performed with much more difficult pieces/songs). Anyways, regarding your audition, I\u2019m sure you did great! I\u2019m sure you did your best during your performances and performed well during those hearing and sight reading tests as anyone who applies to this school should. I think one thing that shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly is the interview section. Even if it is obviously not as nerve racking as the audition itself, Berklee wants to know about what makes you stand out and what is something you can bring to the Berklee community. I also think that it\u2019s very important to show how much you want to be in Berklee during the interview. I also did some research beforehand of Berklee, which I think helps because it shows how much you want to be there.",

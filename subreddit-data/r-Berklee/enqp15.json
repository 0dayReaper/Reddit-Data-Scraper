    "postText": "I want to study a summer course in berklee this year but I cant decide between those 2. I really want to learn about songwriting in any way I can, but the course is only 2 weeks long. The performance intensive is 5 weeks which sounds more interesting to me, plus it looks more dynamic what with the open mic nights and stuff like that and learning to actually perform...  anyone have any insight?",

            "comment": "Personally I think that you should do performance. You'd get 5 weeks of training and you'd learn alot from it. Not to mention that its probably be really fun.\nOn the other hand, the songwriting course would be really good for you as you're really intrested. \nChoose whichever one you need the most help in. If you're equal in both of those qualities, choose the one you'd focus on most or enjoy most.\nGood luck!",

    "postText": "hey guys I'd just like to share with you my experience... I auditioned/applied twice, and second time's the charm!\n\nI first applied a little more than a year ago on tenor sax. My prepared piece went fine, but I totally froze during ear training. Improv and sight reading didn't go too well either. I spent too much time focusing on my prepared piece :(\n\nSo I took a year off and worked on ET, since I wanted to apply again (Berklee's a dream school lol). I took an online course and worked with a private tutor who was a berklee alum. I also did some part/full time work to help pay for school. \n\nSo I auditioned again in November 2022. I played the same prepared piece. But ear training went a lot better. I was asked to playback a melody on the sax. And identify some chords/intervals. Improv and sight reading went a lot better as well. I think the ear training helped. \n\nAnyway, I received my acceptance last week. I GOT IN! (this feels unreal lolz) AND I got a 24k scholarship!\n\nI'm super excited to see everyone in Boston!!!!!",

    "postText": "I'm just wondering if anyone has some advice. I was recently accepted to Berklee for the Fall 2023 semester, but I received no scholarships at all. Has anyone had luck appealing this with the school? I emailed Admissions to plead my case, but they just reiterated that all applicants are automatically considered for merit scholarships based on the audition. I probably won't receive any financial aid because it looks like my wife and I earn too much (she recently finished grad school with lots of debt, but makes a good salary).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPrior to the audition, I told myself that I probably wouldn't go to Berklee in this exact situation. It's too much of a burden to take out more student loans. Also, I'll just say upfront that I'm a white male, so I wouldn't get any minority scholarships.\n\nI am a talented enough drummer that I feel I should have a chance at a partial scholarship at least. I don't say that to be arrogant; I'm certainly no virtuoso, but I did a one-year intensive performance program at a good school years ago and I know that my skills are competitive. However, my audition could have gone better. I had trouble hearing during my prepared piece even though it was my own band's song that I know inside-out!! I'm almost wondering if it would be worth trying a second audition if they even allow that (or declining admission this time and re-applying in the future). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry if this was a bit long-winded. I really want to make this work, but I'm certainly discouraged. I'm open and grateful for any advice!",

So the financial aid people should know that your wife doesn't make as much as it looks.\n\nMy son had a first audition for admission January 2022 via Zoom, which he felt handicapped him as he really prefers a live audition. He decided to wait a semester and apply again for fall 2022, hoping to get a live audition since we were coming out of pandemic restrictions. Unfortunately they still didn't let him come to campus, but he did get about 50% more of an offer, which made it affordable for us.\n\nIf you can afford to wait another semester, I'd wait and apply again, maybe coming to Boston for the audition. I don't think they allow redos on auditions for the same semester. When my son held off and tried again, we knew it was perfectly possible that we'd actually get a smaller offer the second time.  But in your case, you can't get less than $0!",

When I wrote my letter, I tried to plead my case with multiple factors, and I made sure that debt/finances weren't the sole argument. I knew it was a long shot, but as the comment above said ..

I know everyone's situation is different, so I'll just say that I don't think it makes financial sense for me to attend such an expensive school without any aid. I did a one-year music certificate back in 2008-2009. I had no family help with tuition then either, so it was all loans.. and I just finished paying it off in 2019! \n\nIf I may ask, did you decide to attend? I've heard that you can reduce some costs by testing out of some classes during placement exams. I might take that approach too, and hopefully test out of something like intro theory and ear training.",

I\u2019m not sure how much testing out of the music courses really does. I guess it could potentially help you graduate in fewer years, but the credits are on a flat rate. That means every year you will pay the same amount, unless you are overloading. My advice would be to take your liberal arts classes somewhere else if you can, and transfer in the maximum.",

            "comment": "You\u2019re better off applying again another year, I think in rare cases some people are offered a small scholarship when you come in and do your post admission/ratings audition for your department to see what rating ensembles you\u2019ll be in and which private lesson teacher youd be a good fit for.\n\nOkay you\u2019re white but those are not the only type of scholarships and your race is a detail, Berklee doesn\u2019t have to go looking for diverse groups of people as much as a typical Fine Arts school or even the Ivy Leagues. Sure they look for economic underprivileged potential students but at the end of the day, groove and feel and musicianship are the best things you can put on display. \n\nAs far as the sound during your audition, should\u2019ve probably sounded checked once or twice.\n\nDon\u2019t be discouraged. \n \nLook at the faculty and alumni of drummers. That\u2019s not necessarily the bar to get in but those are the company you\u2019d have the honor of of studying at the same school as those cats. \n\nSometimes people try to stretch out and play stuff they aren\u2019t totally comfortable with to try impress or show their chops in some genre they think judges will be impressed with but this is for everyone, should you audition again, play what you are most comfortable with and will show your best skills at. Always good to diversify your tune/groove selections and practice your reading and ear training, and learn how to play the melody of your tunes and melodic drumming in general for a way to impress the judges. \n\nGood luck in the future\n\nPs \n\nYou auditioned and got in. That\u2019s not something anybody can do. At least save you\u2019re acceptance letter and frame it and put it on your college resumes and musical resumes for future gigs. \nGood luck on your musical endeavors, and seriously be proud of what you accomplished.",

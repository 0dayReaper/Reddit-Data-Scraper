I've been playing for about 7 years and wanted to open my playing. I've been seeing that it's a wast of time going there and mostly negative things so idk. What do y'all think???",

I've learned so much about every aspect of music from theory to production to business. Its definitely not a perfect school, the administration is kinda shit, but the education is worth it.",

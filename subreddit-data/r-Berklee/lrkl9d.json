    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI want to go back to school to possibly pursue a career in music (being a music teacher is one of the only professions I could see myself genuinely enjoying.)\n\nI graduated in 2019 with a degree in computer science. I really wasn't mature enough going in to college and I did a lot of growing up while I was there.\n\nI am interested in applying to Berklee, just wanted to know if it's rare for them to accept people who aren't immediately out of high school. Do you guys know anyone who has come to berklee in a similar situation?\n\nI don't want to have the rest of my life determined by a choice I made when I was 18. That's not going to happen",

Might even be able to get a year of transfer credits out of it (there's some cap as to how many hours).\n\nThat being said, I dunno - you've already got in your hands one of the most valuable degrees out there. Do you really want to move to one of the toughest and lowest paid (on average) careers? Or would not spending $200k on Berklee for 4 years, and teaching music on the weekends or such be something that could make you happy? What's holding you back from being able to teach music with the skills you've got now, today?",

They don't care much about your past, really just have to demonstrate a commitment to music and reasonable ability.\n\nThat being said, I left after one term. You can pretty easily teach music on the side via craigslist or a simple website. The $200k tuition will take forever to pay back with the salary as a teacher, assuming you mean private lessons. If you want to be an actual professor you will require a Masters to be competitive so budget 6 years of education before making any money. \n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any questions, I get the passion part of it... that's why I went. But a little bit more research into the music job market would go a long way for a lot of Berklee hopefuls.",

    "postText": "Basically what the title says. I was a freshman during the 2020-2021 school year and a sophomore 2021-2022 school year. I was struggling a lot with personal issues and also there was COVID. My grades dropped a lot but I started recovering them towards the second semester of my sophomore year. If I start working harder academically and get A\u2019s and B\u2019s (what I was getting in middle school and started getting again last year) will I still have a chance of getting in or will my first 2 years stop me from getting in? I\u2019ve been preparing a lot for the audition and I will start working on the interview as the time comes, so my main concern is grades.",

            "comment": "I had a similar thing happen to me. I made really high grades all throughout high school until my senior year which I started to quite literally fail all my classes but managed to bring them back up in the last quarter. As long as your Junior and Senior years are an improvement (or probably just passing) then you should be good because Berklee is a music school, and they care more about your ability as a musician rather than someone who could keep a 4.0 GPA.\n\nTl;dr you should be fine!",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI'm a first semester at Berklee and I'm having trouble envisioning what I want to do with the rest of my life. I love performance and songwriting, but I've heard from so many that those majors are pretty much pointless and don't offer you a lot of tangible skills. I was originally interested in MP&amp;E, but I don't think the jobs are much better there. EPD is interesting to me because I like to produce, but I'm not good at it and there are so many technological things in EPD that don't interest me at all. I'm a very creative person, and things that aren't directly creative and abstract don't really interest me as much as other things. CWP is what I'm looking at now, but I'm not sure if I'd be able to handle the theory part of it. I'm not sure what do. Now I'm thinking of minoring in Musical theater performance as well, just to add. **If anyone could give insight or advice, I'm very stressed about this**. THANK YOU :)",

Be thoughtful about designing your own curriculum and use the freedom to explore anything &amp; everything you could see doing professionally in the future. Everyone I know who makes their living completely from music does more than one thing: composing, performing, producing, teaching - all of the above in most cases. Having a diverse skillset of things you love doing is what will best benefit you in creating your own music career. I literally read the entire course manual every semester to make sure I was really picking classes that were both interesting to me and useful to what I wanted to do after school, and have actually used most of what I learned in college to pursue many different opportunities since.",

If i get into Berklee im thinking of going for that since my whole life I have done both fine art and music, and music therapy seems to be a perfect blend of the two. Plus Berklee has a really amazing program for it. I wish you the best of luck deciding!!",

Just what I\u2019ve heard but food for thought when I was deciding",

            "comment": "Yes - the 160 Mass Ave building has a fitness center open to all on-campus students (i.e., if you live in the dorms, you have access regardless of which building you live in). If you're living off-campus but have a friend who lives on-campus, they may be able to swipe you in.\n\nIf you're living off-campus, you have a few options:\n\n* YMCA on Huntington Avenue, which is a half-mile walk from campus. You'll need to pay a $42/mo membership fee and bring your Berklee ID with you.\n* Boston Sports Club, located in Prudential Center at a 10 minute walk, offers reduced rates for Berklee students under the age of 24.\n* Planet Fitness, located in Downtown Crossing at a 15 minute subway ride, offers $10/mo memberships.",

    "postText": "Hi all, I have a beat-up Selmer Bundy 2 with a new Yamaha 4c mouthpiece and I've been struggling for about 8 years to learn how to play anything properly on it. I am looking for someone who can take a look at it and tell me what is wrong and how to fix it as well as teach me how to get comfortable enough to play simple stuff, so I can improve on my own (right now I'm still stuck in the frustration phase). A little disclaimer: I also play guitar/bass and piano, but I learned all by myself, so I don't follow any kind of \"rules\" and I don't understand much music theory. That being said, I need someone who is open to teaching by showing me what/how to play, rather than drowning me in theory/lessons/boredom. Please DM me if you are interested. Thanks!",

    "postText": "Hi.  I am applying to Berklee for fall 2021.  My question is regarding the auditions.  I play several instruments, but my love is the piano.  The problem is I am self taught on the piano and play by ear.  I read music and can sight read and such with my other instruments (I play jazz on the sax) but not with the piano.  I am applying for contemporary writing and production and not performance. I would rather audition on the piano bc that's how I compose, but would it be a bad idea due to sight reading?  Any suggestions would be helpful! Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "It depends on when you are auditioning. I would do as much as I can between now and your audition time to practice reading as much as you can, but mainly preparing a solid audition piece. My reading is not at all where I would want it either, but I still was accepted a few weeks ago despite that fact. The purpose of the audition and interview is to prove to them where you are in your musical journey and determine if the school is the absolute right place for you. Make a good impression, prepare well, and do your best, that is my best advice. They will know you are committed.",

            "comment": "So my audition is actually today and im having my own little panic at the moment and reading these lol. Ive reached out to a lot of current students and many people say they struggle with sight reading. I play bass and have very little experience sight reading but am going to hope for the best. I have some resources students and my teachers have sent me to help prep, although they probably won't help for piano since most of it is from bass curriculums. If you give them a heads up that your not the best with sight reading they apparently will help you through it. They don't expect you to be perfect or even great at it. This is coming from a bassist, so it may be slightly different on piano. You should go find some pianists on the Berklee class of 23' Instagram page and ask them for some info. They can probably also give you better input on your specific situation.",

I was nervous about this exact issue when I auditioned and decided to record my own backing track (omitting the first guitar).  However, after talking to other kids that were accepted, I found it was fairly common to use the song itself.  I think you\u2019ll score some points with the judges if you can find or create your own, but apparently it\u2019s not a dealbreaker.",

Also if you have an iPhone, bring a dongle to connect it!\n\nEdit: assuming you\u2019re auditioning for next year and it\u2019ll be online, you probably don\u2019t have to worry about that whole dongle thing lol",

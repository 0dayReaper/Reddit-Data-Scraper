Everything else went well I think, especially my improvisation but man I\u2019m not really excited about my rejection letter",

Nerves are worse if you\u2019re a vocalist, and you have to hope that they recognise that. I bombed the sight reading, I looked like an old lady trying to read... I\u2019m waiting for my rejection letter too. Do you have any recordings of your singing?\n\nHow were the auditioners acting? Did they ask if you had music lessons? What song did you sing? How did your overall audition go?",

They asked about if I had any recognition or anything at high school and I talked about stuff like how I got top score in my states all state festival. I decided to do Ease my Mind by Ben Platt because (when I\u2019m not nervous as hell) I think I have a nice tone for it and it shows my range really well. How about you?",

I chose a song personal to myself, which is from the 70s, because it has a deep meaning for me. I was extraordinarily nervous, and it was evident, which might be bad. I even told them that I was nervous after the performance, just so I could get some water quickly. Do you have recordings of your singing?",

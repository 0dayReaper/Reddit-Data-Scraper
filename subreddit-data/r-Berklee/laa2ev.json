    "postText": "Hey everyone! It's me again. I'm a vocalist applying to Berklee, and I am trying my best to practice my ear training skills for the audition. I have an okay handle on intervals, but chords: diminished vs. augmented are pretty difficult for me. Anyone have any tips and tricks? I've basically been doing [musictheory.net](https://musictheory.net) daily for about thirty minutes. Thanks in advance!",

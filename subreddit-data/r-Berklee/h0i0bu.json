    "postText": "I will audition two or three years later so I definetly have enough time to practice. \nI have two songs in mind but i'm not sure on which one I should audition with.\nOne of them is Nola by Felix Arndt.\nIts pretty fast (around 180 BPM) and takes great technical skill and has a couple nice key changes, but has very simple melody and chords, its a typical early 20th century novelty piano piece. It takes around 3 minutes for me to play\nThe other is Because by the Beatles.\nIt has a slow tempo of around 80 BPM and is pretty slow, but has some very nice chords and key changes and has a very challenging harmony. Its around 2 minutes and 50 seconds.\nFor the record, I will soon start online music production courses from Berklee.",

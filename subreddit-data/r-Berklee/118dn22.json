    "postText": "Hey all, I\u2019m a male resident in Honolulu Hawai\u2019i and late last year I flew up to Boston to audition voice. I auditioned one original and one cover which I felt went pretty well and I also feel the interview went fairly well. The things I\u2019m worried about are my high school gpa 2.6 and my lack of letter of resignations. If my first choice for major was mpe and second was songwriting what are my chances of getting in? Thank you for your time, Mahalo!",

            "comment": "The average gpa at Berklee is very average (3.0). My impression from the tour was that they\u2019re more concerned with your musical experience and skill than your high school grades. The people going there are choosing a career in music, so I would think it doesn\u2019t matter much if you don\u2019t have an outstanding GPA, given you were focused more on your music. \nIt\u2019s definitely an advantage to have a higher GPA, but if your interview and audition went well then I think your chances are pretty good. Good luck :)",

    "postText": "Hey all. I consider myself well versed in some DAWs and techniques but I am lacking in the technical aspects of sound design/ computers etc. \nBerklee put out a list of terms to know for the ESPAs (I wanna test out of Intro to mtech) but i\u2019m looking to study beyond that so I truly understand. I\u2019m talking about textbooks, videos, guides etc. Ill include the link to the terms, most of which I am blindsided by\u2026\n\n\n[Link](https://college.berklee.edu/core/glossary.html#terms-intro_music_tech)\n\nAny help is super appreciated!!!",

In the advanced Harmony part for example, you'll have to analyze a lot of dense chords within a small time frame",

I just got accepted ED for fall admission at Boston campus but was told that I will only know about decision for my request to study at Valencia will be taken end of March 2020. \n\nDoes anyone know how many students are selected each year?\n\nWhat are the criteria in your opinion and if this option has been a successful pathway?\ndoes it depend on your instrument? Possible major? Do grades and audition weigh in the decision?",

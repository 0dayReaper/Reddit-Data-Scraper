    "postText": "Hi All,\n\nLast year I was accepted into the fall semester of 2020. I decided to defer until this upcoming spring semester of 2021. For the last couple of days, I've spent probably 15 hours figuring out what the hell to do. My question is if Berklee has always had the policy that; for my situation, I would not be able to defer from the fall of 2020 to 2021? I feel like this is such a strange thing to do, considering most every other university allows students to take gap years. \n\nAlso, feel free to add any thoughts about the BTB hybrid plan.",

            "comment": "Hi! I had a similar situation last year. I was accepted in November of 2019 and decided to defer to the summer semester. Seeing that everything had moved to online, I didn\u2019t feel confident that I would succeed in that format  and wanted to defer to the fall. I was eventually allowed to defer but I had to get in contact with administration and submit a request. I would suggest getting in contact with your enrollment officer and asking them about this option. The reason they won\u2019t allow you to defer at Berklee specifically is because they don\u2019t want people to be out of practice when they start. I understand the situation and being at the end of my first semester I can definitely say that starting at Berklee online is very stressful and difficult, but if you aren\u2019t able to get a deferral I would still suggest attending online. They do a lot to help make it easier and you will still learn a lot even if it is through zoom. You got this!",

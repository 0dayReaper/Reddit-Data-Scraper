Not to be pessimistic, but I left after a semester because the financial burden isn\u2019t really worth it. \n\nThere are schools that teach you music, and then there are schools that teach how to find and latch onto those better/more famous than you. Berklee is definitely a contender for the latter.",

Be your natural self and everything will fall into place. If you don\u2019t get accepted, you can reapply the next year. It\u2019s not the end.\n\nBerklee is an expensive school, but that shouldn\u2019t push you away if you\u2019re truly passionate. See if this college is right for you first and whether or not you think you\u2019ll be successful. This college is mainly for making connections and getting into the industry - that\u2019s the huge benefit of this school in my opinion.",

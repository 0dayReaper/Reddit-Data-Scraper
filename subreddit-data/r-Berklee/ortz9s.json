I\u2019m a singer and want to learn about music arranging and composition.\n\nI noticed there are tons of videos of Indian songs on the Berklee YouTube channel like this one: https://youtu.be/0GWWcwpGosw\n\nMy goal is to make original songs rooted in Indian music. Can Berklee help me get there? Any Indians who can share their experience?\nThanks in advance!",

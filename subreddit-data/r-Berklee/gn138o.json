I did some scrolling through the berklee2024 insta and have just been researching berklee in general and I cant help but feel a bad type of nervousness about me not being good enough. Sure, I passed my audition and I know that music is what I\u2019m passionate about. I practice relentlessly but it seems like everyone is just. So. Talented. As someone who\u2019s very into experimenting/genre blending, I wonder how good I\u2019m gonna fit into the community there.",

            "comment": "Trust me, 98% of people feel exactly the same way you do. I promise you, you are good enough. You got in for a reason. And you will have no trouble at all if you\u2019re into genre blending. There are people who play literally any style, so you\u2019ll always be able to find someone to play with. It just means that you\u2019ll be exposed to many more people than you would otherwise, which is the entire point of Berklee. \n\nThe first couple of weeks are kind of intimidating, but after a couple of weeks, you realize that Berklee is not scary at all. The school and the people in it are all on your side.",

I think the admissions committee makes this clear: if you don't know some things from the audition, that's okay because we're going to school to learn anyways! Berklee accepts the most talented students all over the world... so if you were selected, then you are definitely worthy. :-)",

            "comment": "Haha! Nothing to worry. You are good and at the very least everyone will feel the same way. Talk to everyone, be friendly and respectful, and be curious. Literally everyone here is too busy working on their shit to even criticize you. Theyll most likely help you and want to work with you. Just like they did with me:).  Oh and 270 is really tight. Everyone chills together there. Only downside is its kinda messy. 150 or 160 is preferable to me though, all my classes were like walk away and it doesnt hurt to have the cafeteria an elavator button away. Youre gonna have a blast dude... the classes are fun but need dedication and a bit of effort, but most of all youll meet so many fucking cool people. I had my ego death there lol.",

To the point where I almost talked myself out of wanting to go to school full time. After getting accepted, it made me feel much better because you're here for a reason. We all are. Berklee is a field of well fertilized soil. Do everything you can to learn and focus on being you and it will all work out.",

Victor Wooten said listen to any bass part that Pino plays. Anyone can play that, but it's the fact that he came up with it that keeps him touring stadiums. \n\nLearn to look at the other kids with crazy chops and see opportunities to jam with them and learn rather than shy away from them because you're self conscious. You'll be totally fine! See you there man.",

    "postText": "Firstly they had waivered the entire application fees after reviewing my application and videos , secondly after the audition and interview they had made another exception for me which is they allowed me to submit my original highschool documents instead of the U.s equivalent credentials which was mandatory for Applying International students .\n \n I had performed the piece  Stone cold by Demi Lovato which was 3 octaves lower than the original scale ( to showcase both my higher range and low scale range ) , i checked my voice range from different videos ( B2- E6) , i also performed my original song , the technical part of call and response , i could keep up perfectly 8 - 9 of them , improv part i performed with an Rnb track , the auditioner seemed impressed , there were no hiccups in the prepared piece part and they didn't stop me either , the sight reading part i could only read 4 bars as i didnt have any prior training but taught myself to read music from videos and all in 5 days . The interview part went really well , he seemed really impressed .  I have multiple experiences of collaboration with multiple artists , have a verified Spotify profile with original music and 160 monthly listeners , inhouse voice over artist , done multiple gigs in cafes , YouTube channel with 630 subscribers , lead and choreographer multiple concerts in school .\n\n\nWhat are my chances at scholarship and acceptance ?",

You seem to have the right experience that they look for so if you don\u2019t get in I doubt it was because of your audition. Probably a numbers thing. \n\nIf you don\u2019t get accepted, definitely apply again. Good luck!",

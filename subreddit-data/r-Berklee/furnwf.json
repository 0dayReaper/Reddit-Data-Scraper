This past year I have been working on my Bachelors for MP&amp;E. \n\nI auditioned for the Boston Campus for this coming fall and was accepted. I think Berklee Online is very good, but the right person with the right attitude can learn a lot from it. I can\u2019t say it helped me in my audition, but for an average EDI performer it may have been bolded on the page.\n\nAlso the credits, I think are transferable directly to the school so it does help in terms of Money.",

I should mention I completed my core music classes at Berklee back in the 90s and am re-enrolling to finally finish my degree. \n\nWhat you should know that you can learn before the test, I would assume anyone applying to Berklee would know these things:\n\nKey signatures \nMajor and minor scales\nHow to read in bass and treble clef\nIdentifying intervals written on a staff \n\n\nThere are also some ear training exercises. You can\u2019t really learn this information but practicing identifying intervals using one of the many apps available will help.\n\nThe rest of the test may be a little tougher depending on your experience:\n\nAnalyzing chords - a series of chords written as notes on a staff and identifying what each is (V7, I-7, bIII-7, etc...)\nVoice leading - a series of chords written as above along with six different examples and defining which is the correct voice leading example.\nChord substitutions - same as above with a what is V7/ii in the progression shown, etc...\n\nI got 8 wrong out of 93 questions or something like that. About 3 were my fault because I was going too fast and didn\u2019t read. Of the six a few I was flat out wrong and a couple were d\u2019oh! moments.\n\nAgain, I\u2019ve already completed all of my Berklee core classes back when it was four semesters of ear training, four of harmony, two of arranging, two of trad harm and two of counterpoint. Back when I started at Berklee and took this test I\u2019m sure I did horrible.\n\nDon\u2019t stress it, I think they use this not only for test out but to put you in the correct leveled class. Not sure if this Is still the case but years ago there would be a few et1 classes (for example) and they would put more advanced students who didn\u2019t test out in one and less advanced in another, this wasn\u2019t broadcast or anything it\u2019s just how you would end up in a class that would go at your speed. Again, not sure if this is still the case.",

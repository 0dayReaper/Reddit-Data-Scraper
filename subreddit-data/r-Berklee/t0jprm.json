    "postText": "I had my audition on Piano yesterday. The interview seemed to go very well, as did the prepared piece. The ear training went well, too, I was able to play back the melodies and rhythms given to me, and my improv was good but not great. However, my sightreading is really bad. I could barely read what was given to me (I thought I\u2019d have a few minutes to look it over, but I had to play it right away). I could barely get through the piece. Afterwards, the person auditioning me told me, \u201cjust practice a lot, and in a few months you\u2019ll be able to sightread really well\u201d. I don\u2019t think the rest of the audition went badly, but some things were by no means amazing or outstanding (like the improv). \n\nTl;dr: Will the poor sightreading play a big part in getting me rejected?\n\n\nThank you all so much \ud83d\udc9c",

I don't know what the bias is for the audition panels on an instrument basis (do they need piano to sight read more than guitar?).\n\nCulturally is there is a larger expectation among most musicians that a piano player can sightread better than an electric guitarist. Heck, I'm an electric guitarist and I can sightread 10x better on piano than guitar.\n\nIt probably didn't _help_ your chances, but it also probably didn't sink you entirely.\n\nAs it is *every* year, it really comes down to the competition. There's more applicants than openings, and they have to sort by how strong of candidates folks are. But the strength of the pool changes too. \n\nDo practice sightreading nonstop for the next few months, regardless of where you get into. It's the #1 worth it thing you can do for yourself. Especially as a pianist, it's really critical.",

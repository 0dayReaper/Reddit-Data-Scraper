Are you guys a tight cohort? Is it hard going to a school where everyone is a musician in a non-musician program? How do you like the specialized staff that you work with? Are you very connected to the kids majoring in MBM?",

Classes in the first year have been a great experience, (at least personally) I feel we've delved into a lot of ideas that are interesting to explore in the everchanging landscape of the music industry. There are some kinks here and there, but as we are the inaugural class and proverbial guinea pigs of the program, it was expected. I'm fairly certain by the time your daughter arrives, they'll be worked out.\n\nThe cohort is relatively \"tight\" - with 30 people however, naturally smaller groups have cliqued up. We communicate on almost a daily basis, about the happenings within the major, school etc.\n\nIt's not necessarily difficult being in a non-musician program. Most of us are just musicians anyway, (I myself am a lyricist/recording artist) and are in the program for a deeper dive for personal interests. That doesn't mean you *have* to be a musician. Anyone who has love for the craft will have a great time. \n\nThe specialized staff and material we cover tend to build upon each other, or blend. Oftentimes, we'll find topics or material we cover in one class bleeding into another. Many of the professors we learned from were very great professors - open to ideas, open to discussion, and well-versed in knowledge in their field. Professionals who make the class engaging and fun. \n\nand as for MBM, not particularly. There are some MBM students who will be in our classes, but for a lot of the major requirements, our program has been batch registered. \n\nHope this clarified a bit, and helped you and your daughter in her decision. If she chooses to come to Berklee, we'll be looking forward to meeting her. Take it easy.",

We just have to figure out how to pay for it. She didn't get a merit scholarship and are now waiting to hear if we get any financial aid. It sounds like a great program, we are absolutely thrilled.",

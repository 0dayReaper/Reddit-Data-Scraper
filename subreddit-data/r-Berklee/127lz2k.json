    "postText": "Hello everyone, I am a 16 year old international student that has done an application for the five week summer programme. I also filled out the scholarship application of the program with the 3 supplemental videos. Even though I applied before the priority deadline I have just found about city music. The website mentioned that there are some full tuition scholarships available with the aspire scholarship but a limited amount. Was there a higher chance of me getting a full tuition scholarship if I applied for the city music one? Also, I am applying as an undergraduate next year (most likely). Is it worth applying to city music after this summer?",

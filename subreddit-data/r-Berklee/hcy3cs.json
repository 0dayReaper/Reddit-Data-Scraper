I want to apply to music school however am getting extremely anxious about it as I am self taught, have never had anyone to play with and don't know if I'm good enough to even get in.\n  \nThings I can do: Read music, Play by ear to a certain degree. Id say I'm not good enough at this. Play songs I enjoy.\n  \nReasons I worry I won't get in: Self taught , Haven't had much training in improv, Don't know all my theory.\n  \nWhy I want to get in: Community, Become better than I am now, In depth education with other students, teachers and a curriculum.\n  \nTarget school: Berklee Reasons: heard they accept many people now adays, Have ties to Boston, Can afford it and am interested in it.\n  \nAny advice or input is greatly appreciated. I'm a bit dumb so I'm sorry if this sounds jumbled.",

I watched some online guitar videos like \"my Berklee guitar audition\" and stuff but they aren't very helpful. Some people say you can be bad and get in some say you have to be good. I'm mediocre right now and want to go to Berklee to get better and learn everything they have to offer about music and how it works. \n\nI want to know a bit about how good you have to be to get in to the school initially.",

But it kinda makes it seem like if I'm not too good I'll get in but just not get a scholarship. I watched a video saying something similar like even if you kinda suck but you fit the vibe you get in but you don't get a scholarship and you start at a low level like 1out of 7 or something.",

It seems to me that the auditions are about viewing you as an entire package - one musical entity, almost like a brand?\n\n I am a self-taught songwriter and guitarist, and was self-taught in voice until around a year ago. I'm a mediocre sight-reader, I know next to know real theory, and well, I can't speak much on improv because I think out of all the principles, voice is likely the easiest to figure out on that one + I have a decent ear. If you are super worried about the improv portion, they have practice tracks on their website! Some 12 bar blues tracks, some jazz tracks, etc. In my audition one of the people watching me simply walked over to a piano in the room and started playing for a few minutes and asked me to improv over it. Again, I auditioned as a voice principle so it's not like I suddenly needed to make sure I knew every scale on guitar, but I did find that practice tracks actually really helped build my confidence in the improv area. There are also countless other improv tracks on YouTube. \n\nI hope that helps a bit! If you know you can afford it and you have ties, I'd say apply and find a way to make a bit of a weekend out of the audition process. Apply early action if you can to avoid having to audition in December unless you are ready for the holiday foot traffic. For me it is a pretty long plane ride to Boston from my home town so that bit was a little less than great.",

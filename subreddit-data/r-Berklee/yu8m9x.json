What is your experience with this?\n\nI was hoping taking them at a community college and then transfer or if Berklee online offers anything. I start Berklee in May 2023 so I also wonder if I have time to finish if I start now?",

Berklee online would probably have some core music classes, and you should be able to take some of the liberal arts classes elsewhere and transfer them in. It\u2019s worth checking with someone in the registrar\u2019s office to make sure the classes you choose fit the requirements of what\u2019s on the degree.",

            "comment": "When I went to Berklee a decade ago, I managed to test out of most of my core classes and a few classes from my major (music ed). Managed to shave off two semesters, or 32 credits, off my studies. \n\nYou *can* take them at a community college, but there are two issues. 1. You won't be able to transfer credits; that's not allowed. You'll have to take a test to prove that you know Berklee-specific materials. 2. Berklee's curriculum is different from what you'll find at most other music schools. So what you learn at a community college will be great for general knowledge and personal development, but I won't count on it helping you to ace the ESPA (entering student proficiency exam). \n\nIf you start in May 2023, you have more than enough time. Please check your dms.",

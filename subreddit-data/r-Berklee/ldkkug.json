    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nI'll be auditioning to a Berklee summer program soon (not sure which), and I wanted to know if you guys thought I should play \n\na) an expressive solo/chordal bass arrangement of My Favorite Things (that accurately represents me as an artist) or\n\nb) a medley that shows my ability to switch between different styles of music (e.g. latin for eight bars, rock for eight bars, funk/fusion for eight bars, etc)?\n\nBTW, if I am accepted and  do not attend due to not being able to afford it, do I take up what could've been somebody else's spot?\n\nThanks for any replies!",

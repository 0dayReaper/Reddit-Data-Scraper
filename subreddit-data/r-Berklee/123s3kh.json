But you\u2019ll also have to get good on piano quickly as well, and unlikely to be able to solely do accordion. \n\nI also could be wrong. Something to ask admissions and the piano department. I always wondered what they\u2019d say if I applied with a non standard instrument",

There is an accordion professor, and you can enroll with accordion as your principal instrument. \n\nYou will sorta be inside the piano department for the most part, yes, but you don't need to switch to piano entirely if you're a good accordion player.",

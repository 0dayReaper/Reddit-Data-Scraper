I\u2019m self-taught, and would love to meet other musicians because I don\u2019t know any in real life with the day job I have \ud83e\udd72 Would love some open mic, karaoke, and gig friends! I play mostly pop, indie, and soft rock music. I write in those genres too. Hit me up if interested \ud83d\ude0a",

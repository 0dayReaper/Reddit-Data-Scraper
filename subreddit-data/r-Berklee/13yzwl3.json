    "postText": "Now I've never been a great academic but I've always loved music and I've wanted to go to Berklee for its broad selection of degree and diploma programs\n\nNow if I go to Berklee I'd go for a diploma in Jazz composition as it's all music classes and I believe It's something I can manage.\n\nHowever, I got into my other dream school as well which is the Manhattan School of music now if I were to go there I'd go for the bachelor's in music of jazz performance and this is the more risky option for me. It's probably silly but because of my spotty academic record I'm terrified of spending all of that money for it to go to waste but the Manhattan school of music seems like such an incredible opportunity I don't know what to go with.",

The Manhattan school of music is more risky but seems like a good opportunity and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s better to go with the safer option in my situation which is Berklee when it\u2019s possible that I\u2019ll turnout better at the Manhattan school of music despite the risk",

Don't hesitate to ask some questions if you have any!",

I mean, does the fact, that I am poor, increase my chances to get a scholarship at Berklee?\n\nHousing:\nWhat is the minimal price for a rented living space in Boston near the college? Or is it better to just live on the college grounds?\n\nAge:\nI'm 21 and have massive amounts of hair all over my face, so I look like fully grown man. For international level I consider myself a bit undeveloped(Russia doesn't have too much to teach drummers, not too mane teachers, no drumming community at all). Do you think that the Jury at the audition/interview would judge on the fact that other auditioned drummers play better than me but are 5 years younger?",

Sorry for the delay, I hope this is still helpful for you.\n\nFor the scholarship, there are a few ways you can earn them. For me, I had been granted one from an audition - they gave me a decent scholarship due to the success of it, and good performance. I also know that there are indeed scholarships tailored for people needing financial aid. If you want to talk with someone who actually knows about this rather than me who thinks he knows, send an email to financialaid@berklee.edu \n\nFor housing, I've lived fairly close to the campus for all of my time here. The lowest I was ever paying was around $700 per month, and I currently pay around $850. Boston is expensive =/ You can live farther away and potentially pay around $400 - 550 if you're willing to commute (using the T, et cetera).\n\nAge doesn't matter. I came to this school when I was 21. Sure I had some classes with people who were like 17, but I personally found it funny rather than weird. The people at the juries have had students who are 35 years old, or older, and are impartial (= I wouldn't worry about it at all.\n\nHope this helps, feel free to send me a message whenever!",

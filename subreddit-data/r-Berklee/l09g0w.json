    "postText": "I am a nineteen year old female singer-songwriter taking a gap year due to the pandemic. I have taken voice lessons for four years, mostly classical, but I am doing more commercial stuff now. For my audition, I plan to sing an original song while accompanying myself on guitar. I am a decent guitar player but not amazing. Is it a bad idea to self accompany? Right now I am also debating between performing a country song or a musical theatre song for my cover. I know that Berklee is a more contemporary school, but I feel like I sing the music theatre song much better. The musicianship/ear training part of the audition is not my forte, but I am working hard on that daily. How much do you think Berklee takes this into account for singers? Lastly, what about the interview? Is it an integral part of the admissions process or more of a formality? I would love to hear any advice you all can give. Happy Auditioning!",

There is a MT scene at Berklee if that\u2019s what you want to do. They care more about what your voice sounds like and what you can do with it, not the style of music you sing. There is less of an emphasis on an interview and more attention on sight reading, ability to repeat a melody, etc. Keep working on sight reading and ear training. You\u2019ll do great!",

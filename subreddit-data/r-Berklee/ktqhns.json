            "comment": "Not a guitarist but a drummer who was accepted with a scholarship, the best advice I can give you about the audition even though it seems so over said and minuscule is honestly just stay calm and don't over think it. You aren't competing against other guitarist to go to Berklee, they can take as many as they want, so don't stress over that. They are super chill and cool in the audition, they know that you're nervous so they take that into account. They usually start you playing your prepared piece then you sight read a (easy) chart  from a big band piece usually and then you will do some call and response type things like rythyms and chord recognition. And in the interview, don't try to be what you think Berklee wants. Be who you are normally. As how you get a scholarship, I honestly don't know. They just kinda gave me one lol. I'm sure you'll do great! Good luck my dude!",

It seems like it's a super competitive ambient because of the global fame of this school and this makes me quite anxious about, and this was very useful, also thank you for telling me about the audition, and well done for entering with a scholarship!",

Also, learn the major modes and start practicing sight reading... so many guitarists (including myself) bomb the sight reading and still get in, so it'll give you an upper hand and its a great skill to have! Get a real book if you don't have one and sight read one melody out of there a day... take it real slow, learn it out of time, clap the rhythms, start by finding the lowest and the highest note in the melody and based off of that figure out the best place to play it on the guitar (there's no right answer to that, all about preference and what sounds good!).\n\n And most of all, have fun and don't stress!",

Find one you like and play with it a bunch. \n\nhttps://www.berklee.edu/admissions/undergraduate/practiceexercises\n\nBe respectful! It seems obvious, but it can go a long way. They\u2019re looking for people who will contribute to the overall experience for other students as well. Make them like you. \n\nAlso, at the end of the interview, when they ask if you have any questions, say yes! Ask about returning to campus, student life, specific questions about majors or classes especially. That shows that you\u2019ve done your research and are very interested in THEM, not just what you can get out of them. \n\nStay calm. They know you\u2019re nervous. They\u2019ll be nice.

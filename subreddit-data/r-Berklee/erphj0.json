    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI was hoping I could get some advice before my audition in a few weeks. So I applied as a Production &amp; Engineering Major because I've been producing since 2014, but I'm not really any type of musician. I chose piano as my instrument because when I produce that's what I play the most, but I don't know how to really play pieces or full songs. I've taken a beginner piano course and learned the chord progressions of my favorite songs but I feel like that's not enough to impress anyone at Berklee. So I guess my question is: Do they even care about musicianship for the MP&amp;E major? \n\nI feel like in my interview that I'll be able to explain my background well and that even though I'm not a trained musician I can make really good music because I do know my way around chords and scales. I was thinking about even playing a Ray Charles song like Georgia on My Mind which I can already know the chords for and I probably won't make mistakes when I attempt to play. \n\nI can tell there's a lot of talented musicians at Berklee and if I was admitted that's what I would hope to become so the music I make can get better. I guess I'm just not confident Berklee will see the potential I see in myself with the proper guidance. Any advice?",

Yes, there are new majors like Music Production and Engineering, Electronic Production and Design, and Music Business and that focus on technological and business aspects of the industry, but this does not mean by any means that there is less \u201cmusic\u201d in the curriculum. Everyone takes \u201ccore music\u201d classes during the first four semesters at Berklee that really establishes a strong musicianship in each students that goes above and beyond in the music industry.\n\nAlso, you technically don\u2019t declare your major until at least your 2nd or 3rd semesters. Trust me, once you start taking classes, you might decide you have interests in other majors!\n\nAs for you audition, play what you feel most comfortable with. Prepare something to the point you know the changes by heart. As long as you are highly familiar with the tune and can demonstrate that, success can be found. Just remember, your audition consists more of just your prepared piece. I am sure you know about the Ear Training, Sign Reading, Improvisation, and Interview portions. Don\u2019t forget to be prepared for these portions!",

I guess a better question would have been: Are they more lenient on students who are not applying for an instrumental or voice major? \n\nI think it's worth mentioning though that I'm applying as a transfer so I don't think I could be undeclared.",

Musicianship is absolutely essential from the way Berklee looks at things. They are honestly even tougher about it for MP&amp;E students than most majors, since it's one of the few that you have to apply to latter on, and they look at your scores/grades for a few specific subjects. And they have pretty high standards there! I got rejected a few times from applying into it myself, and went with music business instead since I was already helping run a professional studio. \n\nNow, you might be able to get in. I'm just not honestly so optimistic about your long term prospects there unless you make becoming a musician your #1 goal. It's basically a music conservatory. Music is essential. \n\nThere's some places like FullSail that care a lot less about musicianship, and still produce a lot of excellent outcomes.\n\nGood luck!",

I definitely have other backup plans, but I really would like to become a musician at Berklee. It is what it is though.",

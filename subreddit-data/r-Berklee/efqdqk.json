            "comment": "As said, definitely wait until you see how the scholarships pan out, they\u2019re literally the reason I\u2019m able to go here. I know it\u2019s early to think far ahead in the future, but it\u2019s really good to be able to ask yourself the tough questions, important questions. What do you want to be doing with your life? What is your plan for Berklee, what do you want to get out of it? Does Berklee get you closer to that goal than other paths? Can you teach yourself what you want to learn? That stuff and more is a really good gauge of things and I think you\u2019ll be able to answer your question on your own from that.\n\nI don\u2019t regret coming here (studying Guitar Performance), because though there\u2019s a lot I could teach myself, having a private instructor of a high calibre can make a big difference. I also want to learn a wide variety of topics (e.g. conducting, theory) and taking classes seems easier than delegating my time to the study of each practice. I also see Berklee as an important networking avenue, one of its main advantages over other schools.\n\nBest of luck with whatever you choose and happy holidays!",

You can learn music without spending hundreds of thousands - that said, you can learn some cool stuff at berklee. But people are seriously struggling with debt and that's real, too.",

I'm only 3 semesters in and not sure how long I'll be able to stay given the price, but I'm on a way more focused path than I was before I attended berklee.\n\n20k+ in debt, probably wont get a degree, but I don't regret it (yet)\n\nAuditions keep you sharp, you should do it.",

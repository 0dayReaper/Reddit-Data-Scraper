    "postText": "I\u2019m auditioning as an undergraduate as a performance major with my primary instrument being guitar. My Audition is about a month away and I have been practicing Rainy Window by Masaaki Kishibe which is in Open D tuning (DADF#AD). I didn\u2019t think about tuning back for the improvisation and ear testing part of the audition until recently. Would anyone know if they would allow me to tune back to standard and would they look down on me for doing so. Please also give me an opinion on the song if you like it, thanks in advance![Rainy Window Masaaki Kishibe](https://youtu.be/3Rh0NguLTsI)",

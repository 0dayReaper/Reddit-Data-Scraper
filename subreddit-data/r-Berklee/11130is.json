    "postText": "I\u2019m 26 and in my second semester at Berk. (Living off campus). Haven\u2019t really made a lot of connections although it feels like I am handling the curriculum well (guitar performance major) and improving on my instrument. People say that the main reason to go to Berklee is for the connections but I\u2019m finding it difficult to make anything other than general/ loose acquaintances. I understand that the average student is younger than 26, but I don\u2019t want my time here to be a waste. Not really sure what I should be doing with my time when not studying/practicing or what I should be focused on mentally. I know I\u2019m gonna be here the rest of the spring semester and in the summer. Any advice?",

I heard there\u2019s like little job/career \u201cconventions\u201d at Berklee (ask your counselor) where studios and professionals recruit students to work for them. You could build connections with the pros through that or just talk with your professors and ask for guidance.\n\nBut I highly suggest you finding your little group. I know Berklee is very group oriented. Many people find band mates and they just jam together so it\u2019s hard to make friends since most are doing their own thing and always hanging together, but try to put yourself out there. It might feel weird but connect with the younger kids too, say hi and introduce yourself and kind of push yourself into whatever group you feel you might click with.\n\nAlso, we\u2019re both not very old (even though we feel it), but if you want my advice based on experience, Put yourself out there and try not to close your friend group with just a couple of people. \n\nThose acquaintances you\u2019ve made are worth something, so find more. Get to know everybody. Say hi and mingle with EVERYONE. People will start to say hi to you more often while you\u2019re walking the hallways or streets. Ask them their instruments and major and build your mental arsenal of people and their skills that could benefit you when the time comes. You want more recording studio time? Make friends with MP&amp;E students (this is hopefully my major). You want to do a show or start a label? Make friends with a business major. \n\nAlso we should connect!",

I suggest getting involved in the local Boston scene more than anything. Other than my home town friend who eventually became my best friend, I never once played in a band with anyone from Berklee. It\u2019s something that you\u2019re going to have to do anyway.",

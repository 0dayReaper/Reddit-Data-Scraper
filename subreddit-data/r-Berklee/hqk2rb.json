There's no way to socially distance in about 95% of PI classrooms.A \\*tiny\\* number of teachers might want to make special arrangements (it's hard to teach, say, a marimba PI when the student doesn't own a marimba) but even if both the teacher and student are willing the school might still not want to risk it.",

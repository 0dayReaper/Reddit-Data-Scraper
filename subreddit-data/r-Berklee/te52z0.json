    "postText": "I love guitar with all my heart, and come from a middle class background. I really really want to go to berklee and learn from the best, and hopefully form a band, or work as a solo act.\nIf I don't make it big, that's a lot of college debt for someone not eligible for a scholarship.\nSince people have already been there on this sub, should I go all in with all my parents savings to this school? Haven't people just made it without going to a music school? I really want to, but not sure if it's the most practical choice.\nAs someone from India, what scholarships am I eligible for?",

I graduated from Berklee which; many will say is the wrong thing to do as you go to Berklee for the connections rather than the education. I had a bass teacher early on before I went to musicians institute (did BIT back in the 90\u2019s.) My teacher was hands down the best bass player I\u2019ve ever heard. He went to a state university and majored in music. He got a BS in music and has had plenty of work and has turned down lots of work. He said *I thought about BIT and or Berklee but I can get the same education at state college for a fraction of the cost.* With Berklee comes bragging rights for sure, and I don\u2019t regret going. But honestly I just did Berklee a few years ago and only did it because I had GI bill money to spend. If not for that, I wouldn\u2019t have gone.",

They seen to be open to the idea, partly because they love John mayer, but I wanna make sure all you learn is really worth it for the price you pay before going all in",

While powerful, these computers will come with Apple's latest macOS, Big Sur, installed, and they cannot run earlier versions of macOS. Many music applications, especially digital audio workstations (DAWs), and some software in the Core Software Package will or may not function properly under Big Sur or Apple's M1 processor until manufacturers release updated versions. Also, Apple's current line of M1-powered laptops only include two thunderbolt/USB 4 ports. Students should take this information into account as they make purchasing decisions.\"*\n\nWon't this be a problem?",

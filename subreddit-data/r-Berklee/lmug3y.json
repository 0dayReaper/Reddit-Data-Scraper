Any advice on how to choose a piece would be greatly appreciated.\n\n[(1) billy sheehan bass solo - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5omFFeLEXFE) For example how would this come across?\n\nOr per se a  victor wooten piece?

But I can\u2019t tell you how often I was chastised at Berklee just for throwing a lick in here or there. Play something that demonstrates solid timing and remember what the aim of the bass is in a band.",

It doesn\u2019t have some shreddy technical piece or a bebop tune with a bunch of difficult changes (unless that\u2019s what you like). I feel like the faculty can tell when you\u2019ve picked a song that you think will impress them. Just my 2 cents, good luck though\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd",

            "comment": "Thinking about my bass audition, I knew I would be able to prove that my rhythm and jazz technique was good through the improvisation sections, so I decided to just play my favorite song to perform at the time: Bach\u2019s Cello Suite No. 2. It doesn\u2019t fit what I would consider the \u201cBerklee Style,\u201d but I think they could tell how passionate I was when playing. The best advice anyone could give you is to play a song you love. A couple weeks after my audition, I got accepted and offered a 23k scholarship, which felt like proof enough to me that I made the right choice :)\n\nGood luck, you got this!! I hope to see you on campus next year!",

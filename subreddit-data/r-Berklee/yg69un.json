Based on your experience interning and mixing you shouldn\u2019t have any issue getting in MP&amp;E. \n\nI suggest mentioning your experiences and what you want to accomplish with the MP&amp;E major, Berklee really likes students who have a structured plan for what they want to accomplish. \n\nA 3.8 gpa is attainable for your first year at Berklee, just make sure to complete your work on time and don\u2019t skip classes. Create a good relationship with professors as they can help you during their office hours if you are struggling on a subject. Berklee also offers tutors for subjects you are struggling with. \n\nYour first year will be mixed with liberal arts classes, unless you have transfer credits, and your starting music theory / ear training classes which you\u2019ll get placed in according to your test results before starting your first semester. \n\nGood luck with your application and if you have any questions I\u2019d be happy to try and answer them!",

    "postText": "I have wanted to do a degree with berklee online for years and it was my first choice for uni for once I graduated high school. I live in Australia and I ended up leaving high school at the end of grade 10 due to a number of family reasons. After looking at the website it says that I must have graduated high school or obtained a GED to get in, however the scholarship requirements say I need a GPA of 3.0 or higher. Is there any way that I can achieve equivalency of this without going back to school?\n\nI'm currently doing a certificate lll in music which I know counts towards high school credits here in Australia but I don't think it would be the same for Berklee. I know it might be a stretch, but I would really need a scholarship or some significant financial aid if I were to study with them so any suggestions would be much appreciated.",

It's a good program, however, it has limitations because it's all remote learning. I would rather go to my local community college and do an in-person degree but not an option since I work full-time.  If you have any questions you can email their advisor team which is really helpful.\n\nI know your question was about scholarships but I thought I would give you my take on the program since I'm currently enrolled.",

I've had a look at their website and they do currently offer scholarships for online so it must only be a recent thing. \n\nI am looking at online because I live remote so I'm only able to do an online degree anyway, and this seems like the best option. I can imagine there would be a lot of drawbacks though. Overall, as the only option, would you say it's worth it?",

                            "comment": "\"Worth it\" is hard to say because I don't know what your financial situation is but I think it's a quality program. In my opinion you need to have the right mentality. You can't rely on being motivated by a community. You're just grinding away by yourself looking at a computer screen.\n\nKeep in mind that you will need to do live private lessons (via Zoom). You will need to find time on professors schedules. They'll be on US Eastern time and you will be 16ish (?) hours ahead. You might need to be doing lessons at inconvenient times. Same with the live classes. The 1 hour live session isn't mandatory but for some classes is invaluable.\n\nI've been planning on doing a YouTube video on my Berklee Online experience 1 year in. I'll try and send a link if and when I do it",

I've been doing distance education for a few years now so I've gotten pretty good at motivating myself and my timetable is pretty flexible  but the live classes at weird times might take some getting used to. Do they record the lessons so that you can watch them later if you cant make it?\n\nThat youtube video sounds great. Would definitely like to see it when you do it.",

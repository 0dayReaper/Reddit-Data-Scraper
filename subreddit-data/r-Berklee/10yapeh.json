    "postText": "Hey, so I have a Berklee audition in about 2 weeks and I'm very nervous, like I turned in my portfolio (composition) and everything. Am so  nervous that I don't know what song to choose for my audition. I'm pretty confident in everything except sight reading. I'm auditioning for Berklee and will be playing the piano. Does anyone have any advice or any person that has auditioned recently or since am going as a composition major they don\u2019t expect me to be the best piano player ?",

In terms of repertoire, just pick a song that you are comfortable with and you can make sure that demonstrates what you are good at. Be it a \"Classical\" piece or a Jazz standard, I think it works just fine. \n\np.s. I auditioned back in November and I played the bass. I picked Fourplay's \"101 eastbound\" as my prepared piece and I got admitted! Just have fun playing music, best of luck to you :)",

                    "comment": "More on why I picked \"101 Eastbound\":\n\nI originally wanted to choose a Jazz standard (\"How Insensitive\" or \"There will never be another you\") as my prepared piece. However, a friend of mine (a Berklee Graduate) advised against me doing so and suggested me to reconsider, to better pick a piece from a \"Musician's musician\" that I am comfortable in playing.\n\nThen \"101 Eastbound\" came into my mind as Nathan East is one of my favourite bass players. Also, I can demonstrate some degree of technical proficiency, my ability to comp as well as improvise in this song.\n\nSo I'd say it's definitely worth taking some time and thought into pick your choice of preared piece. I did this like two months before my audition and I practiced the hell out of it haha XD",

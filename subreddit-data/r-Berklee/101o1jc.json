    "postText": "First of all, my audition is this Friday, and I\u2019m really excited but nervous at the same time. It\u2019ll be online, and I\u2019m auditioning as an electric bassist for music performance. \n\nHow are online auditions different from in-person ones? \n\nHow would the judges hear your instrument and backing track? Do you just put your amp and backing track in front of a mic?\n\nAlso, is it ok if I have my sheet music with me when I play my prepared piece? Or will it look bad to the judges?",

            "comment": "i can\u2019t say what the difference between online and in-person is other than the obvious, but a friend of mine said it was pretty much the same but less nerve racking.\n\nwhat i did for my backing track is pretty much what you described: i played it on my phone through a bluetooth speaker placed behind me, so that i was (theoretically) still louder than the backing track. make sure to check the balance beforehand!\n\nif i were to judge an audition (which i don\u2019t do), i wouldn\u2019t mind if someone was reading off sheet music for their audition if it doesn\u2019t impact the musicality and personality of the performance. if they were completely glued to the music and it sounded like a midi playback with no soul, then it might be more of a problem.\n\nbest of luck with your audition!!",

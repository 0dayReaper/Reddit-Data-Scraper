I am considering sending an original song and Misty by Errol Garner. I am a singer and I'm considering specialising in Pop/R&amp;B (also I'm an International Student, so pls lmk if that could affect their decision)",

            "comment": "Hey! I was not on 5 week as a 5 weeker but as an RA and tbh i noticed that everyone really varied on what they did. Definitely do something that you feel most comfortable with, thats always the key. I would say the ppl in the program for auditions to do something that 1 would showcase your skills (remember also that Berklee is mainly a Jazz school so having that in mind always helps) and 2 something you feel confident that you can play and that you can show that is something you have studied. \n\nI was also an international student at the time and for my audition i played some traditional drums from my country, maybe showing something you like from you country or culture and even creating a fusion of something could be interesting! Best of luck!!",

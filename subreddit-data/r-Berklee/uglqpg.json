If you\u2019re unlucky you get stuck way out on Commonwealth or something but the people are nice everywhere. The gyms suck but the 160 one is the best if that has an impact. Nice to have the Caf in your building if you live in 160 too",

Idk if it\u2019s speculation or truth but a lot of people think the bigger your scholarship the older the dorm haha. But there\u2019s a line on the form to request whatever building or roomie you want.",

(has heating/AC)\n\n150 - my dorm faces a wall so very minimal natural light which sucks (some rooms have amazing lighting so hit or miss) but rooms are great and my roommates and i bought a lamp, building itself is pretty old but it really doesn't affect much, private bathrooms which have been an ABSOLUTE blessing as long as everyone cleans, + lots of classes are in 150 so very convenient for going to class (has heating/AC)\n\n270 - tolerable but older than 150, a bit further away from the main buildings + fenway, so longer walk (no heating/AC)\n\n98 - we don't talk about bruno.",

Avoid 98 at all costs.\n\nBetween those two, it's really down to what's more important to you. If living in a modern building with gorgeous views and easy access to the dining hall, fitness center, decent solo and ensemble practice rooms, etc. is important to you, you might lean towards 160. Be aware that only public bathrooms are available, and their cleanliness can be questionable at times. Also, since there are only 2 elevators serving 16 floors, you'll likely be waiting for a while if taking the elevator is necessary. \n\nIf a private bathroom is a must, you'll want to shoot for 150. The building is also joined directly with the 130 and 136 buildings, and offers a direct, indoor connection to many classrooms, ensemble rooms, and practice rooms without having to step outside (very appreciated in the wintertime). You're also right across the street from 160, still offering pretty easy access to the amenities in there. However, after living there for a year, the soundproofing is TERRIBLE - even with the windows shut, you can hear Mass Ave in all its glory. \n\nAll this to say: there's pros and cons with each building, so it really comes down to your preferences.",

I'm a student from Europe, and am very interested in Berklee's summer program, maybe anyone has been and could share your experience, and whether you thought it was worth it or not? We don't have anything similar in Europe so it sounds like an amazing experience, especially as a musician, but ofc it's expensive hahah",

All my friends got it except me because I applied late ( like a month before the program started). So make sure you are on top of that.\n\nI made friends I still talk to. Some are from my city and we still hang. I think you should just do it!",

EDI is relatively new for Berklee so they didn\u2019t really plan our classes very well. I went with the intention of learning a bit about music theory and performance, but it was non existent for electronic musicians. Most of the classes were very basic for me personally and I think because it was heavily software based lessons, most kids were caught up trying to learn the software instead of anything about performance or theory. Since you\u2019re doing voice, there\u2019ll be more opportunities for you, better classes/one on one instructions, better teachers, and overall better experience as a vocalist or a pianist. There will be a lot of auditions you could do to join bands (jazz, rock, pop, classical, middle eastern/european) or \u201call star\u201d groups which are for top musicians. \n\n- If you plan on attending Berklee as an undergrad, applying during the summer will ensure you\u2019ll get early decision and application fees will be waived. I applied last summer while i was doing the program and got in in October - I\u2019m starting in May.\n\n- You\u2019ll make so many friends as I said. You\u2019ll get to jam with lots of people for fun and build some amazing long lasting friendships. You\u2019ll also need to manage your time to practice for your ensemble on top of your jam sessions. There\u2019s lots of stuff going on all the time, so it can get overwhelming. This is the best part about the 5 week program though. It gets you out of your comfort zone and tests your time management skills. \n\n- 5 week will get you a taste of what to expect as a college student at Berklee.\n\n- There\u2019ll be lots of electives you can choose before you go, but can also attend ones you havent signed up for. Most teachers don\u2019t take attendance for elective classes so you should be ok.\n\n- Because you\u2019re 20, you\u2019ll probably be in the 270 building which is for 18 and older students. I was there, too. Prepare yourself for HEAT in your dorm as it\u2019s really hot in the summer and you don\u2019t have AC (unless you get lucky). Also, you don\u2019t have a curfew like the younger kids. You can go out and come back any time. \n\n- There\u2019s so much to do in Boston. Lots of restaurants, clubs, shops, concerts, sports, etc. You\u2019re free to do whatever you want.\n\n- I recommend you to stay at a dorm on campus because that\u2019s how you make friends. There are evening events that would make it so much easier for you to attend on time if you\u2019re staying around campus. \n\n\nSome people might disagree with me, but I would say it\u2019s worth the money just for the sake of the relationships you\u2019ll build. I don\u2019t regret it one bit.",

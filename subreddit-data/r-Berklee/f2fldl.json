In the chance that I'm accepted, I'll only be able to attend with substantial financial aid/scholarships. I heard that underrepresented instruments have better chances; is that true? As I am hoping to apply for flute.",

Underrepresented instruments were less competitive to my knowledge. Just make sure you really want to go to Berklee because I\u2019m going to be paying my loans off for eternity. For the record, Berklee was the best experience of my life! However, Some of my classmates who were more established thought they were better off with real world experience.",

            "comment": "I auditioned as a voice student and got in, but received no merit and therefore no financial aid (except for fafsa). for reference, i ended up going to belmont, where i\u2019m getting nearly a full ride off of need-based aid alone. i appealed to berklee explaining that tuition was about 4x what my mom makes in a year and there\u2019s no way we could afford that, and they still didn\u2019t give any money whatsoever.\nat the end of the day, i\u2019m convinced it comes down to how you do in your audition. since there\u2019s no academic merit scholarships, they are more likely to give you aid if you get a talent(merit) scholarship. \nhowever, i also think they got more endowments since i applied so this may be different now",

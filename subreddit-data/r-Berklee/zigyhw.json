    "postText": "The song I'm planning on doing is **Garden Song by Phoebe Bridgers.**\n\nFor reference, here's a video of me playing and singing it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvMCWoYnLpk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvMCWoYnLpk)\n\nI am auditioning with guitar as my primary instrument, but would like to play and sing to show more of my musicianship. This song in particular is a great insight to who I am as a musician, and I'm extremely comfortable with it.\n\nDo I need a song that is more guitar focused? Or is this enough?\n\nPlease give me any sort of insight you're willing to share regarding song selection or the audition process in general. Thank you.",

I think the only challenge is due to the amount of people \u201cdoing the same thing\u201d\u2026 lots of people audition on guitar+vocals. I think it\u2019s good enough though to stand out, especially if you have good sight reading, ear, etc",

            "comment": "I'm a berklee alum. This song is beautiful - I really enjoyed it. My only thought is that it doesn't showcase your guitar skills as much as your voice. And the guitar department is very competitive. On the other hand, the entire admissions/scholarship process does not only rely on how well you perform. They will also take ear training, sight reading, improv, and the interview into account.

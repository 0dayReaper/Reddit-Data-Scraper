    "postText": "Hi everyone,\nI am pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Music Production from Berklee Online. I will be starting my second semester in January. I am supposed to complete one course in piano. I am a vocalist and a music producer. I don't have any experience in piano, except with MIDI keyboards. I can play triads with my right hand, but the most I can play with my left hand is the root note of the chord. I have no independence or coordination between the two hands. And as much as I would love to learn piano, I don't want my grades to suffer. So I am confused between two courses for next semester. One is the Berklee Keyboard Method (OPIAN-100), and the other is Keyboard for the Electronic Musician (OPIAN-150). Can you guys please guide me as to which course I should go for? Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you",

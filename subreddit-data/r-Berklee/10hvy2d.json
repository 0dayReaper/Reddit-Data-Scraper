    "postText": "Hi! \n\nI am an aspiring music producer, however i\u2019m pretty new to music all together. I am currently a senior in High school. I feel like I am late to everything, I really want to attend Berklee but I feel like it\u2019s too late because I haven\u2019t learned an instrument or music theory in general early enough. \n\nI am currently learning piano through my high school, I am on my third semester. I am planning on doing my prerequisites at a local community college then transferring while also continuing to learn piano.\n\nI feel a little demotivated since I have only been learning piano for such a short time and Berklee is my dream music college. I am aware it is a little unrealistic but I want to aim high.\n\nWhat do you recommend? Is there more I should be doing instead of just taking piano at my community college/HS? Is it possible to even get in with my limited experience?",

The impression that I got from the tour is that you must sing or play some kind of instrument in your audition. The audition assesses sight reading, improvisation and some other skills. The audition is a good  half of the application process. But it\u2019s possible it could be different if you\u2019re a music producer. Best of luck!!",

By all means, audition and see what happens - Berklee's audition is holistic and it's very possible that the other areas of your application is very strong!",

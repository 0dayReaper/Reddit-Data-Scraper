I am auditioning for Berklee in a few months after I submit my application, hoping to get a full tuition scholarship or close to it. \n\nI have made All-State for Jazz Drum Set among other various achievements behind the kit that will help my case.\n\nWhat I really want to know is, does anyone think Caravan from Whiplash is too cliche or overused for an audition? I am fully capable of playing the chart and the solo transcription. Should I shoot for a song that uses more avant-garde techniques and more odd time? Let me know!",

            "comment": "good luck getting a full ride or large scholarship they very very rarely give those out. As for the song, while it is typically overused, the staff is looking for a song that best showcases your ability so if you can play it well i\u2019d say go for it",

    "postText": "Hi all!\nBerklee has been a dream school for a long time, it's about to be my senior year and well since it's really time for me to start looking into colleges. I play percussion, marimba (7 years), drumset (5 years), producing music(3 years), and composition (3 months) for percussion ensembles. I noticed that each of these things each have separate auditions and I want to audition for each of them. I want to major in composition but I'm always open to that changing and I want to audition for all of these things. \nIs this even possible?\nWould this help my overall audition application?\nHow would it even work?",

            "comment": "I\u2019m going into my sophomore year at Berklee. Unfortunately, you can only audition on one primary instrument. That is the instrument you will take lessons on and play in ensembles. During your four years you can take on a secondary instrument, but that can be quite challenging. As for your major, everybody goes through the same audition/interview process. You can\u2019t declare your major until you actually start your freshman year. Even then most people wait until second semester. If you have composed music in the past, you can include those pieces in the portfolio option. I hope this helps! Feel free to reach out if you have other questions!",

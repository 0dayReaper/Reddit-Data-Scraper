            "comment": "Pick a solo that you\u2019re comfortable with. During auditions, chances are you\u2019ll get a little nervous, and if you play a piece that is too difficult, you\u2019re more prone to slip up. I auditioned with Rain Dance and had pretty decent success. Your prepared piece is weighted the heaviest during your audition, so it\u2019s imperative that that goes well. \n\nMake sure you know your scales. I don\u2019t remember them asking me anything besides major, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to know the three minors as well. \n\nAfter that, practice ear training just as much as you practice your prepared piece. They\u2019ll ask you to identify intervals, giving the quality and the interval, as well as chords, giving the quality of the chord. They quizzed me with a lot of triads, ranging from major to diminished and everything in-between, a couple 7th chords, and one extended chord (for me it was a maj7 b9). \n\nI did pretty awful on the sight reading and improv portion of it, but if you can do well on those it certainly won\u2019t hurt. \n\nHope that helps!",

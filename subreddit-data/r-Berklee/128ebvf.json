Whether you can still apply depends on whether Berklee will review your award once you do. You\u2019ll need to check with the financial aid people to see if they will, but they will probably say no because you didn\u2019t read the financial aid application instructions. You did do the FAFSA, right?\n\nBest thing to do at this point is apply again for January.",

Financial aid needs to be given through onestop Berklee, and I recommend you to email them at onestop@berklee.edu . \n\nYou will also find an email in maybe a week of an admissions officer that can help you through anything you need. If you can wait, that would be for the best, and then you can ask them exactly how to proceed.",

    "postText": "Basically I'm almost 40 and have undergraduate degree in anthropology.\n\nDream has been delayed by setbacks, mental illness, menial work, lack of focus,  indecision.\n\nBeen learning the listed music's for fifteen years on and off.  I don't know classical percussion but I can read music.\n\nUp til this point I wanted to be ethnomusicologist in order basically to create a way to play Cuban, Haitian and west African music (and Puerto Rican, Brazilian and Trinidadian/west Indian, zouk, gwoka, cadence, konpa, rara, Racine, etc)\n\n\nI'll leave it at that.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nI'm preparing to audition for Berklee, to start on the Spring Semester 2024. I'm auditioning for electric guitar and my prepared piece is Manhattan by Eric Johnson. My studying has been going pretty well but recently I've been thinking of something that I'd love to have some advice on. I studied classical guitar for 11 years (I've been playing classical for 13 years now, and have been playing electric for 4 years) and I really think that showing my classical guitar related habilities (like fingerstyle playing in general)on the audition could really make the difference on my audition. I tried to search for fingerstyle pieces that I could play but as I'm auditioning for electric guitar, it has been quite difficult to find anything good. I would really love to be able to play both classical and electric ate the audition but I think it isn't possible. Do you think playing something classical on the electric could be an option? And do you know any fingerstyle pieces for electric guitar?\n\nThank you so much! :)",

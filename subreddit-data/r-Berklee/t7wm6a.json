    "postText": "I realise that it's already way too late but I did my audition on the 11th of Feb, and when it came to the improvisation section I couldn't hear the backing track when was my time to solo over it, which really impacted the quality (it was a blues backing track). Perhaps it was because I wasn't wearing my headphones but I didn't tell them this for some reason. However I emailed them a day afterwards about it and if it can be considered when reviewing my application, but they only responded on the 3rd this month saying they already added up the scores. Rn i feel very regretful for not bringing it up during the actual audition so someone pls console me lmfao",

            "comment": "Well, you're right that this is something you should have brought up at the time of your audition. I'm going to be honest - Berklee isn't a school where you can expect to receive email responses in a timely manner. \n\nHowever, I will tell you this - even if you're lacking in one area of your audition, you still have a solid chance of getting accepted. Due to a learning disability (which I did NOT disclose at the time of my audition) I am unable to read notation. I couldn't get through the first exercise, yet I still managed to get in with a partial scholarship!\n\nShould you be accepted, the week before classes start you'll be called in for a placement audition. You'll play a prepared piece, as well as some improv and sight-reading depending on your instrument. As of right now the plan is to hold the audition in-person, so you'll really get a chance to \"redeem\" yourself!\n\nI'm midway through my second semester, so please feel free to let me know if you have any questions! :)",

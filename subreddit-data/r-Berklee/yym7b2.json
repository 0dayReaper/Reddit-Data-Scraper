    "postText": "Hi all!  Former BoCo student here !\n\nI wanted to let you all know about a new resource I'm creating!  I'm making a sound library/database of all the acoustic instruments and their extended techniques.  Each technique will have detailed information such as notation, dynamic/range limits, prep time, musical examples, and anything else a composer might need to know.\n\nI'd love to get to work with some of you all and know your thoughts!  You can check it out [sound-index.com](https://sound-index.com). A follow on Insta would be great too [instagram.com/sound.index](https://instagram.com/sound.index) \n\nThe work is getting bigger, this month I'm adding some members from the Silk Road ensemble and BMOP!  If there's anyone that wants to contribute, DM me on insta!",

I can't wait to see more percussion instruments and more vocal types (I play Trumpet, Synthesizer and sing Tenor myself). Off of first glance, I didn't see any keyboard instruments which would be very useful. Especially instruments like the modern organ which can get complicated with stops. Looking forward to seeing this program grow!",

I also need something to help me pay for the musicians so I can give you, the composers, more sounds!  \n\nKeyboard instruments are coming soon :) I'm reaching out to musicians willing to collab (that could include you!)  Just takes time to set up sessions/do work remotely!  \n\nThere's a lot coming :)",

I play Trumpet(already on the website), Synthesizer (which I'm not quite sure on extended techniques, I don't own a keyboard with an absurd amount of settings..) and sing Tenor (not confident on extended techniques as of now). I also own a Kalimba which could be an interesting instrument to add to your collection of sounds!",

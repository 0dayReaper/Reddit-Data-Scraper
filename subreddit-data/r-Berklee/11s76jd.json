I recently got accepted into Berklee NYC for Fall 2023 and I\u2019m starting to look for apartments in NY, but I don\u2019t really know where to start.\n\nI know that as an international student it can sometimes be difficult to find a place, but if you are subletting your apartment or if you know anyone who\u2019s looking for a roommate, please let me know! And also, if you have any tips on how and where to find offers on apartments I\u2019d really appreciate them!\n\nThank you!",

I have some compositions I could submit, but don't know which would be best to use.",

Applicants wishing to have their materials reviewed must submit notational scores of at least two recent works. Scores must be legibly notated (by hand or by computer). Recordings of your works, if available, are encouraged.\"",

I saw \"merit-based\" all the time and everyone always said \"audition is all that matters\" so I'm currently only focusing on my piece. If it does depend on compositions, where do I start? Only 3.5 months left for the deadline.",

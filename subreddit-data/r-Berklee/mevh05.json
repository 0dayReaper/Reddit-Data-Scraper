    "postText": "Hi guys! I got accepted to Berklee but I'm honestly worried I'm not cut out and I'll end up drowning because of my lack of technical experience. I think I got in based on luck and whatever natural talent I had that day but I literally know nothing about music theory and I have literally no technical skill (my interviewers obviously knew this). I'm super stoked I got in but the realization that I am just coming in with nothing hit me and I'm super scared. Are there even beginner courses in first year? I know you do an assessment at the start of the year to assess your level but can I even survive going into the program knowing nothing? Thanks if anyone answers this!",

I'm also really nervous the classes will be so difficult to follow and that as a result I'll lose my scholarship.  I can't afford to lose it D:\n\nBut fear not!  You were accepted because you have potential! You should get started in the work load if you can so you can test out subjects. \n\nI plan to do the same thing and make use of the next couple months to really brush up on all my theory, harmony,  ear training and production skills.",

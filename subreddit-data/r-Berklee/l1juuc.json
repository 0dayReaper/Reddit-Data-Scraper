    "postText": "So I figured I would ask here as you guys and gals would know best.\n\nMy daughter is presently a sophomore in high school planning on attending Berklee after her senior year.  Presently she is an honor student, rhythm guitarist in senior Jazz ensemble, All State Jazz guitarist, and concert master of the senior symphony, and is presently in AP music theory.\n\nLooking over her transcripts she is at the point where she could load up on AP classes.  What we were thinking though is that since her focus is on music perhaps she should take advantage of the concurrent enrollment with the local college which would enable her to get credit for her high school classes, while getting her associates in music by the time she graduated high school.  While we understand the music credits themselves wouldn\u2019t transfer we figured it would still be a good investment as it gives her a jump start on the knowledge itself making classes in Berklee comparatively easier giving her more time to focus on the music itself, and less time studying.\n\nOur question was which looks better in Berklee\u2019s eyes.  Someone who loaded up and did well on AP courses while also doing well in their music work, or someone that just dove into the college end classes for music and focused on their art?  We keep seeing mixed answers for which is better in general for colleges so figured we would just check specifically on Berklee.\n\nThanks ahead of time for your time and advice.",

You can talk to their registrar for the specifics, but for me ALL of my AP credits transferred 1:1 to gen eds, **but not music theory.** Berklee does a placement exam based on their own harmony system, so they may not transfer ap music theory. Don't quote me but I think a score of 3 or higher would transfer\n\nAnother option to consider is clep credits or taking gen eds outside of the berklee system, berklee is often pretty forgiving for non-musical credits. Having said that, the gen ed faculty is excellent thanks to some amazing professors and the pro arts consortium!",

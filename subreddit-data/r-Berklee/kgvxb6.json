So I took a gap year (mostly due to Covid) and started over. Right now, I\u2019m leaning towards enrolling at MacEwan university in Canada this fall. It\u2019s on the list of approved transfer institutions for Berklee, so I can always switch third year. And if it ends up that I still can\u2019t afford it then, then at least I know that their music program is high-calibre enough that Berklee considers it great. MacEwan is less than a quarter of the cost and has a lot of great things that Berklee doesn\u2019t in terms of student life.",

            "comment": "The truth is, it will be difficult to find a job in music therapy to begin with, let alone one that can generate enough income to pay off your student loans. You\u2019ll likely be paying thousands of dollars each month in loans for decades, money that could have been used to purchase a home, car, vacation, etc. \n\nHave you considered Berklee Online? While the on-campus experience can create a very memorable college experience and allows you to network with other musicians, it\u2019s nearly double the cost of Berklee Online.\n\nBerklee Online is still quite expensive, but it would be a great alternative if you are worried about the cost associated with college. You\u2019ll still receive a great education, but you\u2019ll have significantly less debt and be in a better position to start your life once you graduate from college. \n\nWe have a student debt crisis in this country, and there are millions of people who are saddled with student debt and struggling to make ends meet. Please consider your options carefully, and realize that a degree from Berklee, while prestigious, isn\u2019t a guarantee of future success.",

I would strongly encourage reaching out to a few people who are in music therapy positions and ask them how difficult it was to obtain their job, ball park their salaries, and speak about other things/obstacles you may not anticipate.\n\nEvery advisor, recruiter, and those around you with no skin in the game will always paint a rosy picture of the college experience. And unfortunately, many of them went to college back when it was 2000% less expensive and you could afford a great education by working part-time during the summer. They didn\u2019t have to enter the workforce with $200K in debt, trying to pay off student loans that cost $1,500+/month..all while trying to afford an apartment, car, and other additional expenses. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to be optimistic, but it\u2019s another to be ignorant. It\u2019s all about what you value, do you want a great degree in music therapy? (Which can be obtained many different and less expensive ways). Or do you want a degree from Berklee?",

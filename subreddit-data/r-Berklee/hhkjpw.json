            "comment": "Hey! I just did my audition this Friday 26th. It was all good, I prepared my self with audio interface so they could hear me the best. I play the bass and those frequencies are not that easy going with a laptop mic. It's not necessary though. \nThe audition was in 4 parts: \n\nThe prepared piece. I played Havona from Weather Report.\nBut I did my own backing track with my own feeling and groove and i did an improvisation, they loved it!  \nThen they sent me a link with a Backing track and a Chord Chart so I could jam over. It was a bossa nova inspired in Blue Bossa. Easy peasy. You can find these here https://www.berklee.edu/admissions/undergraduate/practiceexercises \nThen we did some ear training. I had to sing some melodies and then play then on the bass. Major scale, minor scale, a major triad with a b6 and a b7. Everything really easy. \n\nAnd then the most feared part: Sight Reading. \nI had two people doing the audition. And the one who was supposed to share his screen for me to read, had some technical problems. And the other one, a super sweet lady, started searching for some music sheets for me to read because she was not prepared. And she got me a Herbie Hancock's  solo for cantaloupe island on bass clef and I was like WTFF \ud83d\ude02 but I managed to sight read almost 4 or 5 bars, thank God they told me I did great on that even though it was super hard. And then the other guy appeared and I got to read 3 grooves that I found really easy after reading a jazz solo \ud83d\ude02\nIt was a 12/8 groove, a 4/4 funk groove and a Latin groove on half time feel. \n\nThe experience is great, they are super cool and the make you feel as relaxed as possible. \n\nI did my interview before the audition and it was also great, the guy who did it was super cool and the make you basically the question that are on the website.\n\nHope you do great on your audition! Just be chill and try to connect the best way with your music!",

I actually auditioned and got accepted for the Fall semester but due to COVID, I would like to try again. I was curious to see how online differed from in person. I'm nervous about sight-reading as well but have been practicing a lot. I'm excited though! I'm a vocalist if you ever want to collab hmu!",

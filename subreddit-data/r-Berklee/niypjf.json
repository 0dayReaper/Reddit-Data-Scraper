    "postText": "Hello, Rob here, composer. I've been on the classical music world for many years, won some contest and work on projects, but can't do it anymore and want to do what really moves me and thats music for audiovisual media. As a classical music composer, life is frustratingly isolated, and I have no real contacts or anything in the Film/games media, and I thought on going to Berklee to make them, and meet people, not much for learning if I'm honest. I'm from south America but I actually had been accepted for Peabody in the U.S before with a good scholarship, but couldn't go at the end as my father got cancer and things went crazy for a time.  Now I applied to Berklee and got accepted, but man, the scholarship is quite insufficient, so that's not gonna happen I'm afraid.  \n\n\nNaturally I rather prefer  just start working on anything instead of going to an expensive school again. But my problem is actually how to meet people that are looking for composers/producers, how to actually do networking....I always read things like; yeah work on anything that is real and takes your name out there, even if its free at the start, etc. And well yes, those are good advices but...how do I even find people to work with. Yeas social media, but, what groups people actually use.  \n\n\nI'm sorry I'm quite lost on this, thank you.",

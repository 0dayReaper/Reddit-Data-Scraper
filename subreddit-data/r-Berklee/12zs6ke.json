    "postText": "Check out Roxbury Main Streets' annual comedy fundraiser on Saturday, May 13. Tickets are discounted for students, and the comedians are all from Boston and are fantastic. I am on co-op with the nonprofit via Northeastern, and we help support small and minority-owned businesses, secure jobs for residents, house the homeless, treat substance use... and host community events like this one!\n\n[buryfunny.eventbrite.com](https://buryfunny.eventbrite.com/)\n\nJust posting this one more time as the event date nears. We are getting a new website right now, so feel free to contact me with any questions in the meantime. Thanks!\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/12zs6ke/video/f1gasduar9wa1/player",

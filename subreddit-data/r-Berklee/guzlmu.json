Are the private bathrooms in the rooms or in the hallway? 150 is definitely my top choice, but if I don\u2019t get it, I\u2019m torn between 98 and 160 for choices 2 and 3. I put 98 as number 2 because they said they have some private bathrooms",

I\u2019ve seen people dye their hair in the bathroom, do face masks, clean dishes...and we were all able to keep it very clean. I hope you get your dorm of choice, but it really isn\u2019t the end of the world if you end up in 160! The views are espectacular :)",

    "postText": "_YOU CAN GIVE GENERAL ADVICE FOR BOTH THOUGH I'VE EXPLAINED STUFF IN DETAIL_. Thanks. \n\nI'm a pianist and I'll be auditioning with a classical piece. \nI can noodle around in the C blues key for the improvisation part and read simple sheets. I can identify Maj, min, Aug and dim chords. I can't really play back a line by ear. I'm not sure if it's asked. I can clap simple rhythms back. \n\nI'm scheduled for late February (online).\n\n*I was also thinking if people who audition this late get   good scholarship. Y'all know anyone who has? If they don't, should I try and get an earlier date (if that's somehow possible)?",

            "comment": "I also auditioned with a classical piece and they seemed to really enjoy it! Ahead of time, i practiced playing through all the improv tracks on the website because I thought they would just give me any of them, but during my online audition they let me pick which one to play, so maybe have a certain one in mind in case they let you choose! You might also want to practice recognizing different seventh chords-- they gave me one of each maj, min, dim, and Aug and then skipped straight to seventh chords. It's not really necessary but it makes you look good :) You might also want to practice matching pitches on piano and if you can play back lines that is a big plus (try to get friends to help you practice like have them play pitches and try to match it). Good luck!",

Otherwise, identifying the chords will probably be based more on luck/chance than skills. \n\nSo some drills, for example, might be: I play do and mi, you sing si (augmented). And this stems from having a solid background in solfege (major and minor), and inner hearing any of those diatonic intervals that occur within the scales. And of course all this stems from a solid understanding of the theory behind the scales.\n\nAnyway, I'm happy to talk more if you're interested. I also have an ear training course [here](https://www.mastermusic.online). But I'm happy to just chat if you'd like to reach out. :)\n\nto answer your original question, I got a pretty good scholarship and auditioned in early march. Nothing's out of the question!",

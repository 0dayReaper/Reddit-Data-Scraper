    "postText": "So curious, are the Berklee Aspire scholarship rejection letters form letters or sincere.  Reason I am asking is received one this morning as a  sophomore which stated:\n\n\" Thank you for taking the time to submit your material for scholarship consideration. We found the level of talent and musical promise very high, making it a difficult selection process. \"\n\nMy question is the last line.  Do they put that on every rejection letter so it is just boilerplate, or does that genuinely mean I demonstrated high talent and promise?",

It would make sense to go to cc to cover those 24 credits of requirements (you\u2019d want to check with Berklee admin to make sure to sign up for classes that will transfer in) but most outside music classes will not get you Berklee credit - except maybe western music history, if that\u2019s still a requirement.",

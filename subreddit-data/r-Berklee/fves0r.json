            "comment": "I think so! There's a lot of freedom that comes with living in the dorms and it makes it a lot easier to vibe at nighttime club meetings/events. Also floors will have R.A.-run activities you can join in. If you ever land a recording session gig with an extracurricular ensemble or something like that, it also helps to be nearby. Being on campus makes making friends easier too, imo\u2014you're in a place surrounded by other people who also don't know each other and you connect super fast at the little hangouts floors and buildings will hold. Plus, you're free to roam around enjoying Boston, late night jam sessions with friends, just vibing and the security guards will literally never question you no matter what time nor how many times you're in and out throughout the night. In general, I think living on campus is a great opportunity for you to get yourself out there as a Berklee student and really start making those industry connections and enjoying Berklee life\u2014not just the school and all the fancy tech but the community which is the foundation of being a musician (and a person, haha).\n\nCongrats on getting in if you're an incoming first semester! Welcome to Berklee and you're going to have an absolute BLAST if you keep an open mind and always remember to VIBE. Don't get caught up in the Imposter Syndrome\u2014talented musicians have all different assets, you made it, that means you earned your place here just like everyone else even if they are crazy skilled people around you.",

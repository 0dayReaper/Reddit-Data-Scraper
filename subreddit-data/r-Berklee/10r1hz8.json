    "postText": "So I got my offer on the 31st, and I got in. Then I found out I had received a scholarship of $23,000 a year. I am of course extremely elated and proud of myself as I never believed I would receive such a good offer. However, I am an international student and despite the scholarship there is very little chance I would be able to pay the rest of the fees. I knew before I applied that I would never be able to afford such an expensive college, I only applied because I have wanted to for years, and for me, the regret of never giving it a go would outweigh the sadness of being rejected or not having the money. I have already received offers from amazing places back home, and I don't think giving Berklee my full focus and attention is smart because it is just a college. I just think that because I did better than I expected, I'm still clinging to a tiny piece of hope that It could be possible. I could wait and try to do even better next year in the hopes of receiving a larger scholarship, or I could forget it. No matter what happens I am still just extremely grateful as it has been a fun and worthwhile experience.",

I have heard of students from the US negotiating with the colleges they want to go to buy explaining that other schools have given them more money. It seems like Berklee really wants you, so it might be worth a try.",

I have a son at Berklee and one at Boston Conservatory and both were able to benefit from appealing. Write a well thought out letter explaining your situation. But also realize that they can't give full rides to many students at all because everyone who gets in plays at a high level. Best wishes on your journey!",

At that moment it\u2019s just like my world crumbling down in front of me. Of course I had a hard mental breakdown that day I cried the whole day scolding myself for being such a horrible musician and blablabla but as I calm down I realized it\u2019s just a school no big deal that I scold my entire life just bcoz they did not accept me. I did my best maybe I\u2019m just not a right type for them or maybe it\u2019s not the right timing. So I really feel happy for you that you can get such decent amount of scholarships if it\u2019s ur dream u should really give it a try! Sometimes u just have to follow ur heart! I\u2019m sure there will always be a solution to any questions! I really wish u great success in ur studies and future! All the best! Peace &amp; Loveee",

            "comment": "I am a current student at Berklee and I feel you!! I think that your situation is quite common. Berklee is crazy expensive, and most of the times they give scholarships it\u2019s not enough, but usually a tempting offer!\n\nFor what I know, there is a really good chance that if you start at another college at home, and prepare for a year, and mention that during your application process, they will give you a higher scholarship. You\u2019ll probably be able to transfer some credits in case that happens, or test out of some stuff, meaning that you\u2019ll save money when you get here. \n\nAlso, this place runs on emails. The offices are slightly understaffed from my opinion, and you usually have to send a lot of emails to get anything done. So send emails telling your story! They receive a lot of those, but I\u2019ve seen things happen.\n\nMy story is this, in case it gives you some information: I am from Spain, and applied just in case but putting my whole effort into my application. Got accepted with a partial scholarship just high enough for me to come. Started to look for a job on campus the second I got here, and got one four months later. The job allowed me to keep going. I had great academic success, so I applied for a bigger scholarship and got it! I barely pay tuition now (second year) and I got a job that pays for the rent. I still need some help from my family for other stuff, but I am very happy and satisfied. \n\nI gotta say tho, depending on what path you wanna take, this is just a college and there are many many other great colleges out there. Not everyone is happy here, I personally had a really hard time mentally during my first year. It was crazy, but definitely not happy, in fact it was more sad and lonely.\n\nPlease dm me if u have any questions at all, I got a lot of support from a student before coming, and now I am glad to do the same thing for new applicants :)",

If you search \u201ccss berklee\u201d you will find the info on how to fill it.\n\nFor what I know, the CSS in combination with good academic progress (getting good grades, going to class etc.) and getting involved with the community (bonding with staff, participating in Berklee activities, have a job on campus\u2026) is what gets you a Thrive Scholarship as they call it. \n\nThe election process is not very transparent, so it\u2019s difficult to tell how they elect people. They also have to take into account the scholarship budget of each term, which for is entirely based in donations as far as I know.",

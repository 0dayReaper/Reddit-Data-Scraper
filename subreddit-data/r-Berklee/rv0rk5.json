    "postText": "Hi. I am applying to study at Berklee this fall 2022 and I do not know how to approach the composition material section of my application. I am a music producer and all of my compositions are digitally noted and rendered using my digital audio workstation. I use MIDI, instead of traditional scores. Do I still need to provide musical scores or do I just attach the audio files? Thanks for your answers.",

I was wondering if anybody on here is a trumpet player and what they would suggest to focus on for my audition. Or if anybody has done this over the internet because I'm kinda confused on how thats gonna work.",

Knowing your modes and your scales in thirds helps too. Also, because of corona and remote-learning, they're letting more people in. I wouldn't worry too much about it. Good luck though!",

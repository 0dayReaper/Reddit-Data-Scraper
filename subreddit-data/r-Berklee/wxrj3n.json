    "postText": "I got my first TDAP vaccine in 2007. The booster shot is supposed to be administered every 10 years but I didn\u2019t get one in 2017, I got it this year. The health center is rejecting this booster because it wasn\u2019t given in the 10 year time frame. This is the only restriction on me being able to \u201ccheck in\u201d as a Berklee student. Will this mean I won\u2019t be able to attend?? I\u2019ve already leased an apartment and everything. Are my Berklee dreams over because of a vaccine?",

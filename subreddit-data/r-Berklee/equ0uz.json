I went in with the idea that I\u2019d communicate my philosophy on metal music to them and get across my passion for the genre.  I made sure to keep the conversation near that, finding ways to work who I am as a musician into every question.  You just want to express who you are as much as possible, not what you think they want to hear.  They do put a big emphasis on your specific contribution to the pool of musicians at Berklee, so if you\u2019re not already playing something niche, have a niche perspective on what you do.\n\nAs soon as you get out of the audition room and go up the elevator, do a factory reset if you can.  Make yourself excited and happy, those interviewers spend all day coaxing answers out of nervous, frustrated kids.  \n\nYou\u2019re gonna kill it man, good luck!",

Nobody can really say without being a judge themselves, and even then I doubt there are many hard and fast rules about interviews, but I don\u2019t think you could go wrong with that.  \n\nI play technical death metal and brutal death metal, and I tried to talk about how we reconstruct our relationship with music from the common cadences and melodies we grow up with.  In order words, how do we go from the conventions of children\u2019s songs and popular music to extreme metal?  The other deal is, I see good music as art that successfully portrays a slice of the human experience, that captures an emotion.  Metal music provides a unique venue to express some of the nastier emotions that might not be well received in popular music, and that\u2019s been very meaningful to me.\n\nWhatever your relationship is with your style of music, make sure you get it across to \u2018em.  Hope it helps!",

I know that interviewers like when you ask THEM questions about the school because it shows that you have interest, but I just don\u2019t know what to ask. Is there something you asked the interviewer? Again, thank you for answering my previous questions, your answers were really helpful.",

In hindsight it wasn\u2019t exactly a question she could\u2019ve answered, but it\u2019s the only one that was on my mind at the time.  As to whether it\u2019d be helpful or not, that\u2019s a call only you can make based on the atmosphere.  I\u2019d imagine it depends a lot on the interviewer too.  Mine felt very conversational, and I\u2019m sure my excitement about the school came across during the interview.  As long as the interviewer can tell that you\u2019re optimistic and serious about attending, I don\u2019t see how you could go wrong.",

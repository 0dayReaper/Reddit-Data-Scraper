    "postText": "So I got into Berklee earlier this year and I am considering transferring. I am already in a music program at a different school, but it doesn't seem to be the greatest fit. I am wondering if there are any current students or alumni I can talk to. I am vocalist who is looking into music therapy or songwriting. It would be really great to connect with anyone who has experience with either program.",

            "comment": "Depends on what you\u2019re looking for. Not to sound horrible by saying this but vocalists at Berklee are a dime a dozen and from what I experienced there, drop out like crazy. Not at all saying that there aren\u2019t outliers but it\u2019s wildly competitive. Music therapy is on the up right now but you could definitely save money by going to a different school. Songwriting just takes a lot of experience in life. Best of luck to you.",

    "postText": "Hi, so I had my audition/interview today and I wanted to give my thoughts and maybe have some questions answered, and answers others\u2019 questions. I\u2019m 17, and I\u2019m a female musical theatre composer, I\u2019m planning on attending Berklee to study musical theatre writing (I\u2019ve written a musical already, and having my musicals on Broadway is the goal!) so yeah if (when) I get in, I\u2019m planning on majoring in songwriting. My audition went pretty well, I played an original song from my musical on piano and did some improv, sight-reading, ear training. I\u2019ve been learning sight reading and ear training all my life so I wasn\u2019t worried for that. Plus I was born with perfect pitch lol. For improv, I told them I didn\u2019t really do jazz so they kinda tested me differently on that. I still had to improvise, just created my own melody with chords they gave me. The two people giving my audition were really awesome, we talked about how I wrote musicals, what my musical background was and stuff. It was pretty chill! The interview was alright too, different person than the audition and only one, in the middle my dad accidentally interrupted so I had to run to another room but my interviewer was really sweet about it. We talked about my inspirations, career goals, background, favorite shows, and why I wanted to go to Berklee. I really stressed NYC musical theatre writing cuz I think Berklee is looking for that, especially since it\u2019s a mostly white male dominated field lmao but there aren\u2019t too many musical theatre composers that I know who are my age and like me so I think I have a solid chance of getting in. Best of luck to everyone, feel free to ask me stuff!",

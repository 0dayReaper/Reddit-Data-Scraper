            "comment": "&gt;How viable would songwriting be for a decent job?\n\nIf you're either an amazing top 1% songwriter, probably pretty ok. Anything short of that, and you'll likely never even pay your cell phone bill with it. Can you write a song tomorrow that you'd be proud to show Bob Dylan?\n\nThere are no songwriting jobs to apply to (ok, maybe there's some exception to that, but it's really a far far out exception). It's a career that you make for yourself. \n\nI'm not trying to be cruel; I'm trying to be real, and would rather you be a bit uncomfortable right now than in 10 years when you're 200k in debt and have few career prospects.",

If I had a time machine, I'd go back and skip Berklee and start school with my \"fallback\" (moneymaking) career, and do music on the side. Too much money for too few results. :(",

            "comment": "Look, the job market as a whole right now isn\u2019t doing so hot so nothing is a good idea. I can tell you by going to this school and actually working toward a degree and getting it will get you money. They don\u2019t charge out the ass for nothing. \n\nSW is a fantastic major but not one that really has much real world applications because a good song is a good song regardless of degree. I don\u2019t know many people who just took song writing though, usually people take the minor or dual major with it. It\u2019s very informative but you can just BS your way through it if you want to and still get A\u2019s but that\u2019s not the point. All of the teachers are amazing songwriters who will help you write and even help you figure out what you can do with the degree. \n\nCWP is way more practical when it comes to a job because of all the things you have to do, you basically do a little of everything in the contemporary world. Arranging, production, writing, film scoring, you do it all and a degree in that is going to get you a job no matter where you go, but it might not be exciting work. \n\nNo matter what you do Berklee has so many outside sources to help you and alumni who would rather have you in their production team than someone else. Connections mean everything, keep friends close and have fun with what you create even if it is boring because it shows. No matter what you do there\u2019s a market for it and you\u2019ll do just fine double majoring in those two paths.",

            "comment": "I'm a Berklee student, majoring in CWP. Well, it depends.   \n\n\nI'm a guitarist, performer, worked my whole life as a guitarist... and I know what to expect about the instrumentalist market in the industry. I've choose CWP to have more options (actually I know myself enough and had a few experiences arranging and producing before Berklee).So, getting back to your questions...\n\nIs CWP even worth doing for someone who only plays guitar?  \nwell, I'm doing fine.   \nLearn the most that u can about technology. This is not only a CWP thing, this is a music industry thing. Maybe all industries thing. Master the DAWs (logic, pro tools, Ableton...), the plug-ins, know a little about mixing, mastering etc. These are very important skills nowadays, no matter which field are you into.\n\nIs songwriting a strong major?\n\nHow viable would songwriting be for a decent job?\n\nWhat are your experiences of the 2?\n\nI don't know too much about the Songwriting major to give you a solid impression. My \\*thoughts\\* about it is that you should do it if this is your thing. It's not a good idea to pursue a degree in songwriting with doubts about the market, the industry, and expecting that the degree will take you somewhere. You CAN make a lot writing songs, but is more related to the people you know, your skills (yea you can improve that at school, but...), how you set yourself professionally and etc.",

Songwriting by itself is not very practical, and you can get a lot of the info by buying Pat Pattinson and Mark Sonos\u2019 books. Songwriting 2 was an amazing class, though, and I\u2019m glad I could take it.",

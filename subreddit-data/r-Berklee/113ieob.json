    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m a saxophone player and I\u2019m currently in my last year of my Bachelors degree and started getting into jazz about a year and a half ago. In that time I have improved immensely. I come from a very small town and had very poor music education growing up and go to a very small college with very minimal resources and no real \u201cjazz program\u201d even though we do offer a combo and a big band. \n\nWhen talking to the director of the jazz band the other day about my plans after college, I expressed an interest in pursuing an education in jazz and possibly audio engineering and he said that I should consider taking a year or two off to practice and then consider going to Berklee and getting a second bachelors in jazz studies to better prepare me for a masters program. When I asked him what things he thought I should be working on, he said to simply look up the audition requirements and work on that. That being said, Berklee\u2019s audition requirements seem quite nebulous and up to interpretation. Whereas UNT has very specific tunes they want you to solo over and such, Berklee leaves a lot of that up to each person.\n\nSo my question to everyone is this: What should I be working on to make it into the jazz program? What are some musical skills that I should be able to cultivate in order to have a solid chance at succeeding at both getting in and receiving financial aid?\n\nTLDR; What are the skills someone looking into going to Berklee should have as a jazz musician?",

            "comment": "if you\u2019re just now getting into Jazz, for you to be able to get a full ride scholarship or at least a 50% scholarship at Berklee, it will take more than 1 or 2 years off to practice unless you are doing Charlie Parker / Coltrane / Sonny Rollins type practice routine 8 hrs min more like 10/12 everyday , and constantly evolving not just running scales and etudes. That\u2019s just the very beginning. To get to the level of where you want to be as a jazz sax player and on a full or near full ride, they would expect you to know at least 20 standards, ideally in their original style (swing) but also as a funk, in different Latin feels, in different time signatures( if tune is in 4, be able to play it in 3,5,7 etc) and be able to transpose the tune and chord changes into any of the other 11 key signatures pretty much on sight. Obviously being able to read is key but  I\u2019m talking advanced sight reading in any time signature and be able to ready heavily syncopated, with subdivisions including 32nd, and 64th notes. Ear training is key too. Being able to hear common changes and forms. For example if I\u2019m a piano player, I should be able to start playing a blues (with all chord substitutions) in any key and have you be able to join in within a bar or so, and know the accompanying blues melodies or rhythm changes and again at least 20 standards I\u2019d say that\u2019s the very minimum. Obviously all your scales, chords, inversions in every key. \n\nNow, obviously not everyone at Berklee is at that level but if you want that free ride or half ride even, then that\u2019s (above info) is what I would work towards being able to do well. \n\nBerklee has incredible other programs besides Jazz performance. But before summarizing those, the reason why Berklee has the rep that it does is because  the alum and former professors either are masters in performance, have been on the road with all the big names, have played in numerous big bands that you\u2019ve heard of. They are also masters, often published in regards to composition, improvisation and theory books and methods, have done arranging for big names and famous bands of all types and as the ones who set the bar of what a master professional jazz musician is. \n\nNow Berklee has other programs that require excellent musicianship but jazz is not the only focus. It\u2019s good to have that as a foundation because if you can do all that above , then you can pretty much play and hear anything and that\u2019s where the innovation starts but again this is not the case for everyone.\n\nI could go on and on. My suggestion is check out the other programs that Berklee offers and I strongly recommend you research them because a jazz education or performance degree can only take you so far in today\u2019s world. Synthesis sound design film scoring production music therapy jazz composition music business music education and those will prepare you for a wide variety of career options once you graduate. \n\nAnd you may to stick to jazz for the rest of your education, but it sounds like you don\u2019t know exactly what you want to do, and how you want to get there, and that\u2019s okay! I was a Jazz Peformance major and ended teaching music in the public education system but I wish I had focused a lot more so I could set up my future self to be able to go back and get my masters with a scholarship by keeping my grades up, implementing discipline and routine and incorporating them into my dreams , which I wanted to be a producer and I regret the fuck out of not majoring I that because now trying to learn and even harder to break into the profession with an established body of work and knowledge is a lot harder after you have to work you career or jobs just to keep you head above ground. College is about challenging yourself, realistic goal setting and implementation of your plans, and building good work habits, and most of all building your network of contacts! Your classmates will be the studio heads at all the biggest companies and studios , music executive offices, musical directors/band directors of pop artists, and Berklee is well established as being the standard in modern music education. \n\nOkay, someone at Berklee I hope you are reading this and will consider hiring me so I can build relationships and continue to spread Berklee\u2019s message and accomplishments around the world.\n\nUNT is Denton is a hell of a jazz school and yes more traditional as far as the music they teach but a lot of their teachers have some connection to Berklee. They have incredible faculty at the fraction of the price but you will not have the contacts at the end of your time there but you will have musical skills to get into just about any bands on the planet. Then you apply to Berklee and study one of those other fields.\n\nLove your future self, consider your financial goals as well and factor in how much school you really need before you dig yourself into 6 figures of debt.\n\nIm a Berklee Grad class of 2010, so if you have any more questions, I\u2019m here to lend and help I can. And done the road, you pass it on to a eager, younger cat who wants to get as much info so he can consider his future with as much assistance and knowledge as possible. That\u2019s what was passed on to me from numerous mentors over the years. Lead with responsibility, maturity and with integrity and you will go far and you will be respected. \n\nPeace\n\u270c\ufe0f",

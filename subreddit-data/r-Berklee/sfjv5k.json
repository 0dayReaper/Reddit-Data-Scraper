            "comment": "Testing out depends on the department. The core music classes will let you test out after you take the placement exam in your first week if you pass to a certain score. Liberal arts classes will accept certain AP test scores so you can \u201ctest\u201d out of those. So to put it in perspective, the guy I dated at Berklee went straight to Harmony 4 and Ear Training 3 in his first semester cuz he\u2019s a really good test taker. I got out of my psychology class because I passed the AP exam. I tested out of two levels of a keyboard class for music Ed because I went to the department head and passed their playing exam, so I got the credits for those classes without having to take them. \n\nBerklees website should have the cost per credit, so if you\u2019re testing out of a 3 credit class, multiply that by three and that\u2019s typically how much the course itself will cost.",

            "comment": "it depends on what your son wants. i can only speak from my experience from living in 270 commonwealth, but both 270 commonwealth and 98 hemenway are known to have great communities that last throughout your entire time here and even after berklee. They have basements with practice and ensemble rooms so people are always jamming somwhere in the building, and a rec room with a bunch of stuff to do. But they are old buildings with no AC and if your son keeps any food in his room he will have mice.\n\n160 and 150 mass ave are the newer dorms, but they dont have the communal amenities that 270 and 98 have. I dont know much else about it other than that the elevator in 160 breaks down too often and its a 16 story building. The benefit of living in these dorms is that theyre also the same buildings where most of our classes and the cafe are, so you can just wake up and go downstairs instead of having to walk 10 minutes to campus.",

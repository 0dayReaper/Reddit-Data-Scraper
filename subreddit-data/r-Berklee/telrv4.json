    "postText": "I got accepted for the fall semester, of 2022 with a $14,000 p.a scholarship from Berklee, and unfortunately, we still can't afford the costs of attendance of 4 years. I am planning to apply again for next fall semester and hoping to get a much bigger scholarship for CWP major as a guitarist/singer/songwriter. \n\nI want to know how to start planning for that, some pre-requisites to be eligible for like 60-80% scholarships. I had no idea how to sight-read in my audition so let me know what I should do other than getting better at sight-reading.\n\nAnd I also want to know more ways I can transfer or earn credits before I go to college... I'm an international student hoping to build a strong resume for a huge scholarship from Berklee. Please help me out in planning out my next 9 months before I re-audition for Berklee. I would love to hear your thoughts! Thanks",

If possible you should get your gen eds out of the way at a community college before going to Berklee\n\nIn terms of getting a scholarship, it's going to be really difficult to get a full ride on guitar since that's the 2nd largest instrument at Berklee. It's def possible but you'll have to nail the audition and provide really nice supplemental materials\n\nGood luck \ud83d\ude4f",

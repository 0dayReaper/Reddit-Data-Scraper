    "postText": "Hey everyone!\n\nI'll be attending Berklee starting this fall and I've been looking into the available majors and trying to get an idea of what I might want.\n\nMy principle is voice and my focus/goal is singing/songwriting, but I'm really interested in learning to produce as well! I'd like to learn the skills necessary both for my own music and also so I can work with others on their projects.\n\nI was wondering what the differences between Music Production &amp; Engineering and Contemporary Writing and Production are and which may be a better fit for what I'm looking for...\n\nI appreciate it - thank you!!!",

I'll definitely look into Electronic Production &amp; Design as well...but just wondering, which would you say is the best option as a career path? Realistically, I'd like to pursue something (in addition to the songwriting) that would give me a better chance at a somewhat stable career. I don't want to be struggling for jobs",

I do not have the luxury of a trust fund (or any savings for post-grad for that matter) and have to work towards financial independence once I'm out. I'm lucky that my parents want to pay the entirety of my tuition dues, but that financial security in itself will be gone (and understandably /agreeably so) once I graduate. But as you said: hard work, hard work, hard work, hard work. Oh, I think you may have also mentioned something about hard work? (haha) Berklee can give me tools for success, but never a guarantee - that's up to me. I'm attending a music school after a gap year because I spent my entire life trying to convince myself I was best suited to be a doctor (or at some point a lawyer or businesswoman), but finally took the leap of faith to follow the dream and wholeheartedly pursue what I love. Can't stop there - I have to put in the hours and make it happen. Even if it isn't some \"massive success\", I'll be happy. I'm staying true to myself and didn't trudge my way through some profession I hate! Thank you for all your words of wisdom - I genuinely really appreciate it!",

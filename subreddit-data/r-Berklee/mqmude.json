    "postText": "I recently was accepted for Berklee, and it is my dream school, but there's no way in hell I could pay for it. I haven't recieved any information on scholarships and was wondering if I didn't get any or I might've missed it? I checked the application portal and my email, but no mention. Obviously, I most likely just didn't get awarded anything, but I was wondering how you guys who got some were made known about it?",

You\u2019ll need to go to the \u201cnext steps\u201d part of your portal, and school down. You\u2019ll see a student ID number and a link to the financial aid portal. Make an account and login to there, and go to the \u201cscholarships\u201d tab. Good luck!",

You have to turn in your cc financial form, On the college board site first then they can see your financial need and move from there I\u2019m pretty sure.",

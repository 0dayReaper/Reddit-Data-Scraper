    "postText": "Hey! I am looking to sublet my room in a beautful 4 person apt on Hemenway St. for next fall semester 2023 (Sept 1st-Dec 31st (end date flexible)). I am going abroad in the fall so we just need someone to fill that gap. It is a super super nice 4bed 2bath apartment with all private bedrooms and 2 full bathrooms, so you have your own room! Roommates are 3 other girls; all super nice and considerate roommates!:)  There is a living room space as well. The whole apartment is super spacious and has lots of natural light, there is also wood detailing on the walls which is so beautiful. Rent is $1625/ month. It may seem a bit steep but it's actually cheaper than living in many of the on campus apartments like West Village and it's less than a 5 minute walk to campus. PM if interested or comment!\n\n[the first room shown would be yours, it has a closet and the fire escape!](https://reddit.com/link/zddicj/video/wmg5n9c5rl4a1/player)",

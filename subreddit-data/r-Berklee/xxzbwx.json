The music school I was apart of, it was heartbreaking for us students to watch the most amazing teachers get brushed aside like they didn\u2019t care. It\u2019s so inhumane and yes teachers struggle everywhere but think, how many times has someone said to us \u201creally? Don\u2019t you have a back up plan?\u201d \u201cAre you sure you want to go into music? There\u2019s no money there\u201d it\u2019s so sad.",

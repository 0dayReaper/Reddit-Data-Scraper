At the end of the day you gotta remember that average income 10 years after Berklee is somewhere around 30-40k iirc, the amount of debt you will have is impossible to pay off with the tools the school provides",

While they do have world-class teachers and facilities, going to a local/state college really will not give you any worse of an education, and will surely save you much money. If you think you can improve before them, then definitely go ahead and audition again, but if you can\u2019t get enough financial aid/scholarship money, I advise against going.",

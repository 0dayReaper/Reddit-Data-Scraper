Does anyone have a list, or know where I can get a list of books so that I can get started? I tried going to the Berklee online book store and searching by class, but a lot of them say \"no book announced yet\"",

This is not an exhaustive list, more like some of them to get started.\n\n\u2022 Berklee Music Theory (book 1 &amp; 2) - Paul Schmeling  \n\u2022 Berklee Contemporary Music Notation - Jonathan Feist  \n\u2022 Music Notation - mark mcgrain  \n\u2022 Contemporary Counterpoint - Beth Denisch  \n\u2022 Arranging for Strings - Mimi Rabson  \n\u2022 Essential Ear Training for Today's Musician - Steve Prosser  \n\u2022 Complete Guide to Film Scoring - Richard Davis  \n\u2022 Tonal Harmony - Kostka, Stefan / Payne, Dorothy / Almen, Byron  \n\u2022 Fundamentals of Musical Composition - Schoenberg  \n\u2022 Understanding Audio: Getting the Most Out of Your Project or Professional Recording Studio - Daniel M. Thompson\n\nIf anyone has any more suggestions, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

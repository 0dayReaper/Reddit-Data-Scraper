    "postText": "My primary instrument is guitar, and I had my audition/interview today, and the whole thing went really well except for the sight reading part. The guy almost seemed offended that I didn't know how to read music and honestly, I didn't think it was that important to learn for this since I'd be learning it in Berklee anyway. But I'd like to know, are my chances of getting accepted any lower because I can't read music? I've kind of been stressing out about this since the audition.",

            "comment": "&gt; except for the sight reading part. \n\nI was poor at sight reading entering Berklee, and truthfully a _lot_ of guitarists are too. Not being great at it isn't an automatic disqualifier.\n\nHowever, that you're applying to one of the top music schools in the world and haven't taken the time to learn and practice basic sight reading definitely puts you at a competitive disadvantage against others who can. Could you imagine many violin players auditioning for an orchestra position and not knowing how to sight read? Of course not, it's a pretty critical part of playing music with others.\n\nWhatever the result of your audition, I would implore that you break against the trend of so many other modern guitarists and work at getting good at sight reading. Make it so that you can at least read basic Real Book charts on guitar and play them without ever hearing the piece first.\n\n&gt;  I can't read music?\n\nI should clarify - can you read music at all? You're going to be doing it in nearly _every_ class. Not being able to sight read well is a different thing than not being able to look at a chart and say \"Oh yea, that's a G major scale\" or \"That's a Bb7 chord in first inversion\".",

Biggest regret of my playing is not getting better at sight reading. Aside from playing with others (and more gigs!), it opens up a whole world on the instrument much more quickly, as you encounter new music - scales, patterns, transcriptions, compositions, etc. My advice: Start learning to sight read and keep at it (every day). Your future self will thank your current self!",

            "comment": "Hi hi. I got in this year and can\u2019t sight read. My understanding is that I need to take some classes before to get to a basic level at least - and then there are placement tests to decide what class you need to start in. So worse case, you have to spend more money (on classes) because of having less knowledge. So my plan is to take lessons before the placement tests.\n\nAudition wise, definitely seemed like the other component\u2019s were most important. I was sure to express my intention to learn before as well. But yeah, I wouldn\u2019t worry too much.",

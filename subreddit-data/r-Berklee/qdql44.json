            "comment": "Allow me to add going to college definitely opens your doors to many roots no matter which type of college you choose. \r\n\nThis is tough what I should say being I am a graduate of Berklee. Being I know the \r\nindustry the way I do, I don't think I can recommend any young person from not going to \r\nany college, but Berklee, or college in general, may not be the choice for you.\r\n\nThe choice is not a black and white issue in my opinion. Being a starving artist right after \r\nBerklee, I know I couldn't afford an additional $400 a month in lessons if I chose to \r\ncontinue my studies. That said, I didn't need lessons at that moment because I had so \r\nmuch material that only now is it wearing thin and I graduated over 15 years ago.\n\r\nThe options in life as young musicians: \r\n1. Go to Berklee : Your son may be like myself and wanted a college degree but didn't want to \r\nstudy a ton of general education classes. He may wanted his focus to be strictly on music so \r\nBerklee is the choice. Are there possibilities of finding a better teacher outside the \r\nschool? Sure, but there are a lot of bad *** teachers there as well. You just have to \r\nchoose the right ones. Some push you, some let you push yourself and simply give you a \r\nton of info. I had the latter when I was there in Skip Hadden, Rick Considine, Larry Finn \r\nand Giovanni Hidigalo. You will become a bad *** drummer there, but you have to be \r\ncareful not to take all the proficiency to the point of sterilizing you. Take the classes and \r\nthe lessons more serious. If you are going there for the sake of their degree options, I \r\nreally wouldn't choose anything other than their technologies degrees such as MP&amp;E or \r\nat the very least take the Music Ed. Though an expensive version of the Music Ed degree,\r\nat least you will have a degree that can ultimately land you a job.\r\n\n2. Go to University &amp; study with bad *** teacher in NYC/Nashville/LA: This would be my first \r\nchoice today, but at the time I couldn't handle nor knew what I would study in a general \r\neducation. I believe though I would regret not being as rounded of a musician but having \r\na head start in the industry would have been nice. \r\n\n3. Forget school all together and simply study with bad *** teacher: Talk about throwing \r\nall your eggs in one basket. It\u2019s the fastest route to being a great drummer for sure as long \r\nas your parents don't mind you still live with them and don't ask for rent. You work your \r\n20 hours a week to have enough money to pay for your car and your lessons if you can \r\nactually find an instructor who lives in Middle America somewhere. If your parents live \r\nin LA or NYC then this choice may actually work. I hope you have a rich uncle though to \r\nhelp you start investing in real estate because by the time your career starts to peak out \r\nyou are going to need a place to live eventually. \r\n\nEnd Result: \r\n\n1. Well rounded musician, college degree, great drummer (if you practice and have some \r\nnatural talent), establish yourself with other students and the Boston music scene.\n\n1a. Same as 1 except you realize Boston is not for you so you have to find another city to \r\nget started an established in. You use your degree and knowledge to get a job.\r\n\n1b. Same as 1 except you go a get a master's degree at a school in NYC/LA in a General \r\nEducation and establish yourself as a player in the scene. Perhaps study with bad *** \r\nteacher once a month because you have so much from Berklee to work on and school has \r\nhomework too. \r\n\n2. Well rounded human being, college degree, great drummer (if you practice and have \r\nsome natural talent) and set yourself up in the scene of LA/NYC.\r\n\n2a. Same as 2 except you chose a different city which you may be successful in or you \r\nmay have to move and start all over again without the help of being a college student.\r\n\n2b. Same as 1b except you have a different college degree.\n\n3. The best drummer of all the choices because you have a ton of time to practice and \r\nhave the drive to do so. You become a a superstar and never have to worry about \r\nanything in your life or you get old &amp; realize at 50 you still don't own a home, have a \r\nfamily, have health insurance and no reasonable way to get any of those things.",

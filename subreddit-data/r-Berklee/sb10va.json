However, at the time we were both totally green about the scholarship process and audition prep. He was in the mode of preparing auditions for music programs within Universities that had strict requirements, so didn't really know what the deal was for Berklee auditions. So, is it possible to audition again for an increased scholarship? How does that work? Thanks!",

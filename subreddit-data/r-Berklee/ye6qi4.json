    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m a 5th semester guitar principle performance major. I\u2019m a huge fan of My Chemical Romance and other early 2000\u2019s punk rock/alternative groups (Taking Back Sunday, The Used, Yellowcard, Jimmy Eat World) and I\u2019m looking to start a directed study ensemble that focuses on accurately performing the music of My Chem but also explores other groups in their genre. Right now I\u2019m looking for vocalists, a drummer, bassist, keyboard player, and another guitarist. If this interests you please respond to this post and I\u2019ll message you privately for more information! Let\u2019s have some fun!",

            "comment": "Took both. They\u2019re both good classes for making sure that you have a solid foundation moving forward. Chords 101 will get you understanding &amp; applying all the 7th chords and the Drop 2 &amp; Drop 3s. Scales 101 is a bit weaker because if you\u2019re not constantly applying yourself to the scales, usually through improvisation, you will lose them. \n\nIf there was one class I would highly recommend is Blues Guitar 101, Mike Williams is a killer diller, and he teaches some really fundamental sounds &amp; techniques.",

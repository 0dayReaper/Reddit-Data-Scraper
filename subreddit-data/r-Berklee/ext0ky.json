    "postText": "I just got in a couple days ago and because I didn't think I'd get in, I didn't look in detail into what courses I'd have to take next year. I know there are the placement based mandatory music ones, but what about academic courses? Also- if I take Berklee online ear training, harmonies etc. before fall semester will I just move up a level when I start? Thank you!",

There's an online placement test for ear training before you arrive as well. So generally first semesters take a harmony class (1-4), and ear training class (1-4), and an arranging class (1-2). There's a mandatory liberal arts class for first semesters called LENS as well as an English class and intro to music technology. Then finally you have your 50 minute private lesson and your ensemble. \n\nThat's generally what your first semester looks like. As to taking Berklee online stuff, you could do that, but basically the only thing that affects your placement is how you do on the placement tests. I'd save your money and look somewhere other than Berklee online for that.",

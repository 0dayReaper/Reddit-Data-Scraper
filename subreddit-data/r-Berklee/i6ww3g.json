I was super confused about this too, so I reached out today!\n\nSeems like they'll send us another email in a few weeks asking us to select an audition day/time - this will take place during our orientation week.\n\nFrom there we will be matched up with a private instructor, we'll also choose our ensemble, and our full schedules will come out pretty soon after!\n\nThis is what I understand so far, but you may want to double-check... hope this helps!",

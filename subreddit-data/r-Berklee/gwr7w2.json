Do they send you the sight reading examples before or they show them to you and you have to read them right away?Also will they provide the backing track for the improvisation?\n\nI'm auditioning with Chain Reaction of Dave Weckl. What do you think? Would be a good shot BIG scholarship oriented? :( \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2x2p3jDHM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2x2p3jDHM)",

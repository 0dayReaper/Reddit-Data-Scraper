    "postText": "Hi,\n\nSo my friend has been wanting to major as a vocalist at Berklee, but not only is the website hard to navigate (I swear we nearly got lost), but as an international student plus majoring in this field, we couldn't find anyone who's experienced this before online or IRL. \n\nSince from where we live the economy is not that amazing, we've been looking for how to obtain a scholarship (hopefully full ride, 100%) for international students, but as mentioned above have had little to no luck.\n\nIf you know anything that could be helpful to us, it would be much appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance.",

As I understand, you send in your academic performance, exam scores and all that; Berklee will then consider you for a merit scholarship, but that only finances your education, i.e. your stay, living expenses, books (Lord... have mercy) are on you?~~*\n\n*~~Also, getting like 100% of your tuition covered is entirely possible, right?~~*\n\nSomething can be done with the thrive scholarship later on, but the first semester's going to be tough seeing the price of things.\n\nAgain, thanks a lot!\n\nEdit: I've treedived the website and finally decided to call Berklee. I'm nonetheless very grateful for your answer &lt;3",

Only 40% of admitted students receive a scholarship, and the vast majority are partial tuition scholarships.",

Besides, you'll probably get new audition interviewers and a completely new decision.\n\nYou could also consider starting out at a local music school and then transferring. Or get your core classes out of the way. My impression is that Berklee is fairly generous when giving credit for core requirements. You would have to start over with the music classes, though.\n\nKeep your spirits up and try again. Guitar is the largest principal instrument along with voice, so the competition is going to be more difficult. There's just a lot of luck in any admission decision, more so the more competitive it is. And remember that Adam Neely and Tim Henson both got rejected, too. Adam Neely transferred in and Tim Henson just made his own career.",

So hey maybe a good way to frame it is that you're a year ahead of schedule. If a career in music is really, truly your passion, I'm confident you'll find a way to make it work. An admission to Berklee isn't the be all end all. Best of luck to ya!",

I think a big one is that not too many career paths in the field of music necessarily require you to have a degree to pursue them. Once a student is presented with an opportunity to jump straight into the career they're interested in, there's not really an incentive to finish the rest of your degree. And yeah a big part of the appeal of Berklee is the opportunity to network with people. If you've already found the people you want to work with, that could also be a factor in deciding to leave early. It's a terrific school for sure with a tremendous amount of resources. The graduation rate isn't really a reflection of the quality of the program. I think it's really more the nature of music itself as a field of work.\n\nQuick additional edit: yeah the tuition is pretty crazy expensive too.",

I was also rejected from my dream school (Belmont songwriting) as a senior. I took a gap year during Covid and worked my butt off to get accepted. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I am glad to go here. I have great friends, and I am starting to find my way. However, there are so many great music schools that  will offer you so much more personal attention. I got so much more out of voice lessons on Zoom with a prof at another school than in two years irl at Berklee. In reality, Berklee is really paying for your connections. The courses are mostly taught by adjuncts, so they can be kind of hit or miss. Just something to be aware of!",

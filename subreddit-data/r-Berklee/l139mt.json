    "postText": "I am auditioning as a vocalist and have some questions\n\n1. what is the improv part like? My prepared piece is a bossa-nova, and I'm wondering what they are likely to give me\n\n2.  for the audio set up, can I use bluetooth headphone with a mic? or do I need a microphone to connect separately? (I'm assuming I can't use my computer's internal mic and speakers)\n\n3. how hard is the sight singing part? What do they give you? is it like a leadsheet from realbook?",

            "comment": "Hi I auditioned about a month ago\nFor the improv part, for me i was expecting them to give me a blues, or jazz tune but they gave me something soul. Then again, I sang a soul piece. You really will not know until you\u2019re there so my suggestion is just to practice scatting or just runs over the samples they have on their website:)\n\nOn the zoom they will give u an email how to set up the audio. I would still suggest using regular headphones other than bluetooth just so the microphone on them can pick u up better:))\n\nThe sight reading will start off easy and progressively get harder with each one u can complete. You do not have to solfege either, you can just sing on la. It is also sheet music, but not a song. It\u2019s just notes and should start off in 4/4.\n\nThey are very understanding and do not be afraid to ask them questions. They\u2019re truly there to help! I wish u the best of luck!!",

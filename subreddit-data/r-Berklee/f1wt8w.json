He\u2019s admitted to me that his audition did not go well. However he presented himself in the interview in a way that obviously impressed them, as he was accepted. And good on Berklee cause he\u2019s amazing lol\n\nOn the other side of that coin, my audition went REALLY well but my interview went awry (they told me to go all the way to the top of the stairs and when I opened the door to the roof I thought \u2018this can\u2019t be right\u2019!!!) and was awkward. But I got accepted. So it really depends. To be safe, you should nail both LOL jk. relax and just show them how much you love music. Berklee looks for passion",

Idk maybe I\u2019m overthinking it, I\u2019m a lil crazy lol. Also I know it shows the school that you have interest in it when you ask the interviewer a question, but idk what to ask.

I want to grow my knowledge and love of music in that kind of environment, and I think it would be so unique to go to a school where pretty much everyone has one core thing in common.\u201d  You can also mention how diverse it is, I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s something that\u2019s said a lot. I don\u2019t think it\u2019d be cliche to mention that. There\u2019s students from all over the world who go to berklee JUST for music and I think that\u2019s amazing.

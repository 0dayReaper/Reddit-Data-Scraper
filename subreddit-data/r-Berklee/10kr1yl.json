    "postText": "Ok so I am auditioning next month and I have a few questions about the audition and the school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-I will be a saxophone principal, is there a lot of demand for saxophones at berklee (specifically tenor)\n\n\\-I am playing a classical piece for my prepared piece. Would it be weird to switch to a jazz mouthpiece for improv? I am pretty strong in both styles, but I would have a hard time doing jazz improv on a classical mouthpiece or vice versa\n\n\\-For the pitch call and response will I have to play or sing back? I can usually figure out a simple melody on my sax with the starting note, but I don't have perfect pitch by any means so I'm afraid it would take me a while to find my starting note.\n\n\\-Not related to the audition, but I am going in as a music therapy major, but I want to double major in film scoring as I am very interested in it. I don't have any composition/scoring. experience and was just wondering if I could go into that major as a beginner or if I need experience.",

            "comment": "1. As a Sax player at Berklee, you\u2019ll likely be asked to record a lot more than perform. Be prepared to say No to some of them.   \n\n2. Nobody expects you to improvise in a classical style. Show off everything you can do.   \n\n3. The point of Call-And-Response isn\u2019t necessarily to play the notes back perfectly. They\u2019re checking for how fast you can find it. It\u2019s more of a \u201clistening\u201d test than a hearing test.   \n\n4. AFAIK, Berklee doesn\u2019t offer dual majors. The Pro Music program is available to students who want to tailor their courses to their goals. Film Scoring and Music Therapy are both full time courseloads; you\u2019re not likely to fit them both into your day.",

            "comment": "1. Not too much demand, unfortunately.\n2. Not a problem. Just explain what you're doing. The professors are pretty understanding and it's overall a very casual process.\n3. Play back. They'll normally tell you what your starting note is, don't worry. But if you're practicing ear training for your audition, make sure you practice singing ear training exercises as well - it really helps! Here's a [link](https://www.clarachanmusic.com/s/stories/six-tips-for-getting-into-berklee-college-of-music-and-get-a-scholarship-my-experience-part-1) to my audition experience. And [this](https://mastermusic.online/p/about) might be helpful for your audition. \n4. Double majoring is possible. Music therapy is a long major (9 semesters, assuming no CBXs), so if you've got the time and resources to double major, go for it. If you double major it'll be 11 semesters. Keep in mind that doing well on your ESPA and taking advantage of any CBXs can shorten your studies. And if you study three semesters instead of two semesters a year you can also get through it faster. Here's a [music therapy](https://www.berklee.edu/sites/default/files/2022-10/2022F-Music-Therapy-Degree.pdf?fv=Xha82cR0) major grid. And here's a [film scoring/music therapy major grid](https://www.berklee.edu/sites/default/files/2021-04/BM5_FILM_MTHE_2020.pdf?fv=NB2OFKGJ) (unfortunately I can't find a more recent version). \n5. There's no entrance requirement for film scoring, but they do require you to score a B or higher in [this class](https://college.berklee.edu/courses/film-200) before declaring the major.",

The more common an instrument is the stiffer the competition is going to be. If you play an uncommon instrument like tuba or trombone or something you\u2019re a shoe in tho.",

I mainly wanna show that I can be versatile, so I know a little paino, a little guitar. And with that my production skills as well.",

On the application you select your primary instrument and that instrument will be the instrument you play during the audition.  You can sing while playing the piano or guitar, I know they allow it, but I believe they recommend that you make whatever instrument you selected the main focus, if you decide to sing and play.  I could be wrong on this, but I'm confident that they allow you to sing while playing the piano or guitar.  \n\nFor EDI (Electronic Digital Instrument), if you select that, they have a requirement on what they expect you to do during your prepared piece I believe.    This link shows the requirements and provides a video which I believe is really helpful ---&gt; [https://college.berklee.edu/admissions/undergraduate/electronic-digital-instrument-guidelines](https://college.berklee.edu/admissions/undergraduate/electronic-digital-instrument-guidelines)",

I actually have a friend who is a professional vocal coach and he is interested in helping me out so I think Im gonna go down to route of doing vocals as the main and then playing guitar along with it to show more of my potential. Thank you for the advice!",

Though theyre usually more lenient with people who plan on going into production. I have a friend who auditioned on marimba and the last time he played it was his last private lesson a year ago. If you were in high school band, you can probably just audition on whatever instrument you played. This situation is common. I only know one production major who still plays their instrument, and they play jazz guitar.",

Someone already mentioned this, but everyone starts out with no major declared their first semester.  After you complete your first or second semester then you can declare a major.  Declaring the Music Production and Engineering major, you would undergo an interview with the department chair or a faculty staff, rather than an audition.",

At your auction, you are expected to be just as proficient on your instrument as those who plan to be a performance major.  The proctors are completely indifferent to what your plans are at the school. You will be held to a high standard on your instrument of choice, and compared to applicants that have been extremely proficient at their instrument for a decade. \n\nMP&amp;E \u201crequires\u201d four semesters of nearly straight A\u2019s in your core music classes.  Berklee may not be the school for you if you think you may struggle in Ear Training, Harmony, Arrangement, Private Lessons, and other core classes.  What may happen is that it takes you two or three tries to get into the MP&amp;E program and before you know it, you are 24 and $250,000 in debt.  If I were you, I\u2019d take basic core classes (math, English, etc) at a community college while simultaneously practicing your ass off on your instrument for a year in order to catch up to the other applicants as much as possible. Then, you will have transferable credits.",

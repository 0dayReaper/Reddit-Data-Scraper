The reason you\u2019re going here is because you want to be successful in the music industry; the only way to become successful in the music industry is to have people know who you are, what you do, and just plain like you! Important note: this doesn\u2019t mean go around collecting people like \u201cnetworking cards;\u201d just make friends with whoever you can and try to make and talk about music with as many people as possible. \n\nAlso, take electives you really want to take. Some of these classes aren\u2019t gonna be offered anywhere else in the world.",

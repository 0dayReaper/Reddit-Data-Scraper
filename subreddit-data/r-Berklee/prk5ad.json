    "postText": "Hi\n\nI hope you're well! I just accepted the offer now to study at Berklee this spring. I am extremely excited and also cripplingly anxious about all of the logistics I need to address to move there from Virginia.  I've never left Virginia before lol, and I don't really have family to help guide me.\n\nI'll be relying heavily on FAID and savings to get by there, at least until I can find work that accommodates the schedule. Does anybody who's already a current student have general suggestions for finding a place in Boston? \n\nI want to find housing off-campus that's preferably with other fellow Berklee students for both social and financial reasons - if I can find a way to target housing based on that I'd feel a lot better. I'm bringing my car so I can handle a commute. I also am a little blown away by some of the rent pricing I've seen in the city compared to my current city apartment, something that's reasonable enough for me to budget is ideal. Does anyone have a ballpark range of what I should adjust my expectations to rent-wise? What's a realistically affordable range I can try and target?\n\nAny info you can provide or what experiences you've had would be awesome, I appreciate you taking the time to read this.\n\nThanks\n\nasapclammy",

The trains and busses is all you'll need to get  around. You can use a bike or walk just about  anywhere. For example,  it takes 3-5 train stops to get to downtown from Berklee. It takes 2-3 stops to get to MIT from. Harvard is just a little further.  The total distance circling  these locations is around  8-9 miles total. I just moved my daughter to Berklee. She uses the Charlie Pass for the trains and busses.",

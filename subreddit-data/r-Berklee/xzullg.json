Everybody loves clowns.\n\nCan you play a marching instrument? Great! Get in touch with us and we'll get you hooked into our jolly marching band. Don't worry about skill level, errors add to our authentic clown charm.\n\nCan't play a marching instrument, but still care about reproductive freedom? That's also great! We want as many people as possible to join us in cheering these guys up. Here's how you can help:\n\n* Contact one of our organizers to get tacked on to our clown coordination apparatus\n* Dig up festive, colorful clothing you could wear to brighten the mood! Clown accessories a plus.\n* Noisemakers and instruments of all sorts are appreciated! We'll probably have some spares if you can't find any.\n\nLet's make sure there's a comical and cheerful atmosphere to brighten these men's day! We're not going to be harassing these pious, virtuous men. If you want to be belligerent, don't do it through this organization. We'll be keeping things light, funny and cheerful to buck these guys up! If you want to participate, send a DM to me or one of the other organizers: u/ilikehamsteak , u/ottersinabox , and u/eldiablorojo . We hope you'll come out!\n\n EDIT: here's the link to the Twitter post: [https://twitter.com/marchofclowns/status/1578921708077346817](https://twitter.com/marchofclowns/status/1578921708077346817) follow [u/marchofclowns](https://www.reddit.com/u/marchofclowns/) on Twitter for more updates",

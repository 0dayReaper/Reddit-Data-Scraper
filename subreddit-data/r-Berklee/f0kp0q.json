    "postText": "(AUDITION EXPERIENCE) Tl;dr - professors in audition said they hoped to see me (again or soon, I forgot the exact word) and the other said that I should keep writing songs like that and that he enjoyed it. professor in interview said he had gotten all the answers he needed and didn\u2019t complete the 15 minutes.\n\nHey guys, I just auditioned recently and was honestly not too confident going into it. I want to go into songwriting(/singing), but don\u2019t have much technical training. I decided to apply/audition early December and have been doing my best to prepare since then. I wrote an original song and covered another song to give them an idea of what I could do with another artist\u2019s work and tried to practice any theory or sight-reading materials I could find online. I was the first candidate of the day and went in at 8:30 instead of my scheduled audition time (9) because they were all set up so I got kind of flustered. I did my best during warm up, but could tell that the sight reading would more than likely not work out too well for me. After my 15 minutes, I went in and, other than a slip up with timing at the beginning, my original went pretty well (I think). They told me that they liked my piece. We got through half of the cover and then they decided to move onto to the other tasks. I was able to improv, but I struggled a bit with the sight reading (we only did one of them) and clapping the rhythms back. However, he was patient and tried to help me get them right and I was able to understand what I was doing wrong and fix the mistakes. At the very end, one interviewer said that they hoped to see me (again or soon, I forgot the exact word) and the other said that I should keep writing songs like that and that he enjoyed it. My interview also seemed to go pretty well, but I felt I little under qualified because most of my experience performing was with piano and violin years ago. But at the end he asked if I had any question and I inquired what drew them to Berklee and they seemed to appreciate my inquiry and responded accordingly. The guy who conducted most of my interview (a recent graduate) looked back at the other man (I\u2019m guessing one of the Berklee teachers) and asked if he had any questions and he seemed relatively satisfied and said they he thought they had gotten all the answers they needed, but I don\u2019t think I was in the room the full 15 minutes. I left feeling really good about this but I really don\u2019t want to get my hopes up. I was wondering if any of you have received similar statements during your auditions/interviews? I\u2019d be so excited for the opportunity to go to Berklee, but I want to be realistic. What does this mean? Am I just getting in my head and overthinking?\n\nAlso I\u2019m so so sorry this was extremely long, I\u2019m just really desperate to know!",

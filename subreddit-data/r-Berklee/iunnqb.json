    "postText": "I'm a classically trained cellist. A lot of the videos on youtube in the \"what did you audition with\" series make it look like there are very, very few people who aren't vocalists or jazz instrument players. I'm looking to go to Berklee because I want to do film scoring, something I've become passionate about recently. So I guess I was wondering, does Berklee really take classically trained musicians?",

As an orchestral principal it\u2019s hard to say if the choice is right, but Berklee is world class.  Teachers, student body; it\u2019s otherworldly especially if your end goal is to not be a performance major, but a film scoring major.",

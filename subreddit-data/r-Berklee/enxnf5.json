    "postText": "So my school doesn\u2019t use Parchment. It instead uses Naviance, and Berklee is supposed to use it too, as several alumni have gotten their stuff in through there in the past. By December 6th, it said that the transcripts were delivered to every school on Naviance. Despite that it said on my status page that they never got it. I\u2019ve spent the past month talking to my guidance counselor about it. I watched him send it with my own eyes and he even emailed the admissions team and my admissions counselor a pdf of the transcript, but they still say they have nothing. I emailed the school this morning but have gotten no response. To say I\u2019m terrified is honestly an understatement. Berklee is easily my top school and with 3 days until deadlines I\u2019m extremely scared that they are not going to get it and it isn\u2019t at all my fault. I\u2019m planning on calling the school tomorrow morning about it. If there is any, any advice, PLEASE let me know. I really don\u2019t want to lose my opportunity of going to my dream school because of something that ultimately is not my fault.",

Be proactive but hold back on your nerves and sound professional, stay on the phone with them until it\u2019s taken care of. \n\nYou could also request for a copy to be physically mailed (expedited overnight) to berklees address?",

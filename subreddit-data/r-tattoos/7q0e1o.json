It's built for art.\n\nThe amount of great memories i have from waiting for or staying up late for Simpson's Halloween episodes when I was younger is crazy.\n\nQuestion for you OP though if you see this.. I hate the new style / versions of Treehouse of Horror Simpsons have been doing for the last couple years. You agree with that?",

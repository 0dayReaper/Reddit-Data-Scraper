Always in a guilty pleasure way, though. I never really felt like I could tell my friends I was into them. Which sucks. I never really liked a lot of their newer stuff--Save Rock and Roll was aight, American Beauty/Psycho was better, but Mania was meh.\n\nIdk, sorry for rambling. This thread was a fun trip down memory lane. Also it's nice to know so many people other than me loved FoB! It's not like I ever really got confirmation. Maybe all my friends really liked their music too, who knows! ",

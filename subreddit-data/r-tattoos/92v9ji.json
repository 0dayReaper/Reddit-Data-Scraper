It is pretty subtle, and very hard to explain. \n\nIt's a theory proposed by psychologist Carl Jung, that BASICALLY states that there are \"meaningful coincidences\" everywhere. \n\nHave you ever found yourself singing a song in your head, and turned on the radio to that exact song, or had another incident where you just stopped and said \"whoa this is weird.\"? \n\nThat, is (a weak example of) synchronicity. \n\nIt's a very, very complicated topic that tends to get people up in arms, as lots see it as an attempted replacement for religion or science. For me however, it just ties the universe together, and makes me a lot more mindful of everything. \n\nIf you're interested in reading further, it ties into quantum mechanics and other stuff that's beyond my comprehension at this point in my life haha.

The difficulty lay in the fact that she always knew better about everything. Her excellent education had provided her with a weapon ideally suited to this purpose, namely a highly polished Cartesian rationalism with an impeccably \"geometrical\" idea of reality. After several fruitless attempts to sweeten her rationalism with a somewhat more human understanding, I had to confine myself to the hope that something unexpected and irrational would turn up, something that would burst the intellectual retort into which she had sealed herself. **Well, I was sitting opposite her one day, with my back to the window, listening to her flow of rhetoric. She had an impressive dream the night before, in which someone had given her a golden scarab** \u2014 a costly piece of jewellery. **While she was still telling me this dream, I heard something behind me gently tapping on the window.** I turned round and saw that it was a fairly large flying insect that was knocking against the window-pane from outside in the obvious effort to get into the dark room. This seemed to me very strange. **I opened the window immediately and caught the insect in the air as it flew in. It was a scarabaeid beetle, or common rose-chafer (Cetonia aurata), whose gold-green colour most nearly resembles that of a golden scarab. I handed the beetle to my patient with the words, \"Here is your scarab.\"** This experience punctured the desired hole in her rationalism and broke the ice of her intellectual resistance. The treatment could now be continued with satisfactory results\"\n\nEmphasis mine.",

The house is in the countryside, so it has four main fields surrounding it. One of the fields has a tree that my grandad built a tire swing on. But I wanted to add something that incorporates something from my other grandad, so instead of a tire swing, it's a necklace of Mjulnir he gave me before he passed. My dad's side is Swedish so that's where I got all that from (hence the name Vikingsson). \n\nI had the southern cross put in the sky to show I'm still an Aussie at heart no matter where I am :'). My little mysterious friend in the tree is a credit to the artist who's style I fell in love with (https://www.instagram.com/willpacheco1988/).\n\nThat's the main parts at least.\n\nThanks so much for all your nice comments!

If you don't live near an artist you trust can pull off the style you're looking for, save up! It's going on you forever so you should avoid going for the cheaper option. If you're really interested, go down to your nearest tattoo studio and ask them if they're not too busy. They're usually very happy to help! Just know the difference between them trying to sell to you and them giving you solid, true advice. Thankyou for your comment though! Appreciate it a lot!",

From another person's perspective Sydney is indeed upside down and their interpretation may very well stop there - you're from Australia, ok cool. But from your first-person perspective Sydney is the right way up which may afford a very different interpretation on your end. Specifically I'm thinking how your seeing Sydney the right way up may serve to remind you of your roots as an individual. Very neat.\n\nI don't know if I'm making any sense here. My (small) point is just that I appreciate the symbolism and the differences in subjective interpretation from the first and third perspectives afforded by the design and its orientation.\n\nReally nice tattoo!",

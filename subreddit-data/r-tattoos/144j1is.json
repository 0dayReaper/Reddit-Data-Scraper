So just to be absolutely clear, if you want a tattoo by this guy you need to get on a plane to Korea. \n\nAlso for your information you should never look up a shop when you're trying to get a tattoo. Look up the **artist**. The artist who did my peony elbow switched shops, for example. I'm sure his work is still advertised with the old shop on their Instagram or whatever. So that's means that if I walked into the old shop looking for a tattoo of similar quality they would most definitely pawn me off to another artist who probably can't do the same style of work.",

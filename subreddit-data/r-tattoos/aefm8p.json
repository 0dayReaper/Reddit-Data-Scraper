I had thought of the idea, and after not finding anything online, I made this by taking a screenshot from the show and tracing the outline in a new layer on Paint.net, then deleting the original layer.  I'm no artist and I did it with a mouse in like 5 minutes so the lines look horrible but I was the general idea.  And I actually looked at the photo information of when I saved the image to my phone, turns image had I had made it a couple weeks before the Instagram post you linked.....so I'm just going to pretend I was original for once in my life.",

But if you Google image search for 122 Conch St, it returns a handful of different images from the show very similar to OP's tattoo. It's wouldn't be that surprising that multiple people came up with similar minimalist drawings, and OP's claim of tracing it from a show screenshot is certainly plausible. ",

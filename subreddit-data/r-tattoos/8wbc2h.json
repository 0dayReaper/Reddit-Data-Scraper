I find that statement quite ludicrous, and presumptuous. Fingers heal unlike even the back of the hand. That\u2019s from evolution of our species. The skin just regenerates and heals differently. And experience and skill in tattooing won\u2019t undo that. \n\nI myself have 6 fingers tattooed by VERY skilled artists. And knew enough to not try for an intricate, delicate, or color patterned designed. It\u2019s just simple and blasted in. Because that\u2019s what it takes. And even so, I fell out like crazy. Even hyper-babying the tattoo. \n\nAt any rate, this tattoo is awesome as it is, which is fresh. But expecting this to stay like this is pretty foolish, in my opinion. But I\u2019m just an enthusiast, and that\u2019s just my opinion. ",

Apparently the skin on your hands/fingers regenerates at a rate 70 times faster than other parts of your body, so it's that much harder to get ink in.

My artist didn't even want to fix it because he said it could end up blowing out and looking worse. Luckily all is good now. ",

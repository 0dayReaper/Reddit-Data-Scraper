He acted like he would do a tattoo in his normal style when I talked to him but then he did a watercolor version of it on me for some reason. Watercolor isn\u2019t even his style and he did such a bad job! When I kindly asked him to fix a few areas he didn\u2019t even finish properly he was rude and pissy about it. I always tipped and was a good client but Will has serious attitude and did not deliver the same quality tattoos as the ones in his portfolio. If you go there do not get a tattoo from Will.",

I asked for a green dragon with black and silver. I got there and he explained that he wanted to do black fading into green on the underside and green flame. I'm like ok, that sounds cool. He asks me what color green, and I point one out and he just says no, and shows me what he was going to use. I was so nervous (first big/color tattoo) I just went with it. Wellll a good chunk of the way in and I realized it's basically all black and grey and I actually started crying. It wasn't anything like the other stuff he produces. So disappointing, and he just seemed so annoyed and rude the whole time. Would not recommend working with him.",

I don't have any because I've been obsessed with waiting for something with \"meaning\" enough to put on my body - but isn't the point of a tattoo to look nice/aesthetic? If I sat around and waited for something \"meaningful\" to jump out at me, then I wouldn't ever settle on anything. I'm just looking for a design that I like now, because fuck it I want a badass looking tattoo",

For me it's important that my tattoos don't mean too much for me, because first of all it actually is very tiresome in the long run to explain it to people who ask, and I hate seeming pretentious to others and myself. But most of all, we all change so much that a very personal and meaningful tattoo is like taking a bet: either you have a great story for it when you're 40, or you'll regret it. I was about to tattoo \"sXe\" (straight edge, no alcohol/drugs lifestyle) on my neck when I was 16 or 17 and then I literally started drinking 6 months later. I went ahead and did a tattoo that took me 5 minutes in Photoshop instead and thought it looked dope instead of that, and I still like it.",

The mall _is_ slowly dying, but you can still smoke in there, rent is cheap, there's still relatively okay foot traffic, it's near major tourist spots, etc. so tattoo shops love it there.\n\nMost times, you DO have to watch them - because they MAKE you look as they're  setting up + autoclaving + opening new needles. Then they make you sign a form confirming all of that. ",

However, most color tattoos use multiple different colors which will fade at different rates from each other, which imo makes the fading look more obvious because the design itself is affected. Because OP\u2019s tattoo is all red, it will fade consistently and the design will be preserved longer (red ink is also one of the longer-lasting colors). All that being said, it\u2019s your body and if having a color piece will make you happy then that\u2019s all that matters. And this is a gorgeous piece, OP!!",

Felt normal (once it healed) if it was covered, so not an allergy or anything really, just very heat sensitive.\n\nDon't really notice any issues now, about two and a half years later, but it is still sunlight sensitive enough that I know when I start feeling like my leg is hot it's my early warning system that I need to get out of the sun or get the sunblock on cause I'm about to burn, heh. Most people don't realize they're burning until it's too late, but my tattoo will let me know well in advance.",

On your scale 5 could be 2 on someone's or maybe 6-7. \n\nIf you consider the tattoo you shouldn't consider pain. in my opinion, pain shouldn't be your concern. It comes with a tattoo and you can't get permanent one without it. Period.\n\nWhat you should consider are: \n1- reasons why are you doing it\n2- size, style of artwork and tattoo artists\n3- tattoo is in most cases expensive. Keep in mind that you are not buying a shirt. You are buying something that's going to be engraved in your skin for rest of your life.",

I don't have any psychological or physical state so I can't speak for those people. \n\nMy pain threshold is higher than the average (told to me by tattoo artist). I have several tattoos all done in single seating because I could take it. It would be wrong of me to comment \"it doesn't hurt as much\" or \"hurts like hell but it's worth it\". Also in my opinion if the notion of pain is deal breaker for you, then don't think of getting one in the first place - this is also wrong to say, because different places hurt differently. \n\nMy last suggestion for everyone who are afraid of pain is to get something simple, like a \ud83c\udf40 and ask tattoo artist where it hurts least. It would take ~30min and not be so expensive. That can be your baseline of which you can consider doing something bigger on different skin places.\n\nBut still stand by what I said: \nYou have to accept that there will be pain. How much it doesn't make difference in the first place because we all have different pain thresholds.",

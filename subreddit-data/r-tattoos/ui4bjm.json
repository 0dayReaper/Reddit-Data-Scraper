Whereas with the handpoke i felt every prick because you don't have the consistancy, plus it takes considerably more time. Although, I'd say it also depends on location. This is my leg so not too bad. I have tattoos on my feet that were done with a gun and hurt much more.",

When I went to the jimjilbang and was in the bath part (so buck naked) , I was very blatantly stared at by everyone incl. the scrubbing ladies (there were no young people) and I had eyeballs on me at all times. Some of the older folks left whichever bath I was sitting in every time I moved. It became very obvious it wasn't coincidental. It was a little uncomfortable, but mostly amusing.",

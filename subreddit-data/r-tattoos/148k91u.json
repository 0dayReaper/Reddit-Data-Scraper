    "postText": "Got my first tattoo this this last weekend. This photo was just after the artist finished.\n\nFianc\u00e9e and I each got one (different tattoos and in different places). We\u2019re \u201cDisney Fans\u201d and I really liked this design. It\u2019s a take on the \u201cSorcerer Mickey\u201d hat from Fantasia. \n\nGot it on my thigh as apparently that\u2019s where it won\u2019t hurt as bad plus I thought it was a good spot but damn if that shit didn\u2019t hurt like hell. \n\nRegardless of how that thing felt getting put on. I want to get another one hahaha. That\u2019s how it starts right?",

The most painful ones I\u2019ve had are on my calves because of the proximity to the sciatic nerve.  At one point I almost peed myself.  \ud83e\udd2a\n\nEdit:  I see now that you had it done on your thigh.",

Funny enough I was told I did remarkably well for not moving that leg at all while managing to move my arms and other leg around when it was being done hahaha",

It\u2019s great that tattoo acceptance is becoming more mainstream but there are still jobs and parts of society where that sort of thing is frowned upon or just not allowed.\n\nLike, if you\u2019re secure in your job and you know what you\u2019re doing for the rest of your life, go ahead and get your face or neck or whatever done. But when you\u2019re still young and you don\u2019t know where life is gonna take you then it\u2019s a risk that I think many people don\u2019t fully assess.\n\nI\u2019m just a random dude on the internet, but I did work as a hiring manager as recently as five years ago where I had to turn down otherwise perfectly qualified people who had visible tattoos that they couldn\u2019t cover up.",

It's a tricky perspective problem to untangle: Why do people put a muted speaker to symbolize deafness and not a muted microphone?\n\nI think they're thinking of the \"speaker\" of _the entire world_ as being muted. Obviously this is bizarre because if that symbol was on a computer it would refer to the computer not producing sound, so putting it on a human should mean the same thing aka being mute. Instead, I think it's actually referring to the perception of the tattoo bearer.\n\nWhich is more than a little confusing. It's like putting the Open/Closed sign on your business the wrong way round because you're looking at it from inside.",

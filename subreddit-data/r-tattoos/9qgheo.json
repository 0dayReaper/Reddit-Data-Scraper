When the hourglass is up, the life in question is over. I gave her a ton of creative room to work since I wanted to see what her take on it would be. \n\nI also told her I wanted a headdress that would be blue just to have it sort of contrast against the rest of the tattoo. Main reason for that is that I really enjoy what she does with pieces that have those sort of ceremonial cap bit to it.",

There is usually space on the ribs between them.

Not to make it look like the boobs are smushed together on the sternum lmao.  \n\n[this is my rough interpretation](https://i.imgur.com/uZVFkJw.png)",

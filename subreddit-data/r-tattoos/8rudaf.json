Those designs, of course, are made especially for tattooing - which may seem a bit plain for some people. Unique ideas always grab more attention from the public, and people less exposed to any subject matter are bound to ignore or not care for more subtle nuances.",

The uneven lines, wobbly eyes, bad angles, and claw hands are going to be hard to fix. They can add the missing cleavage (wtf is up with that?) but honestly I'd be asking for a refund and looking for a better artist to do a repair job. Maybe with more shading and color the problems won't be noticeable. ",

That makes sense.\n\nI still think it applies to the real world, though. Most of us don\u2019t have the ability to change the way things are, or at least we don\u2019t think we do. Maybe indifference is a callous term to use, but inability to act and/or helplessness are both also applicable to these \u201cthe world is horrible\u201d situations to which the comic is usually applied.

It seems - from my perspective at least - that Green fully understands what it's like to be overwhelmed, but later realized that he should have addressed the fact that even in crisis that doesn't mean you're *actually* helpless.\n\nI'd love for him to do a third comic about the dog in the fire, in which the dog ignores things like his smoke detector and such, because a lot of what's happening in the world today has been building up over time and people have ignored or not even noticed the warning signs.",

This tattoo is another example; did he ask the artist permission to use their art in the act of a commission?      \nTechnically, KC could sue for copyright infringement here and be completely on the side of the Law. While the idea is ludicrous (what happens? Laser removal? Money? Pish) it reinforces the idea that you should always ask for permission to use their art in any endeavors.           \nSorry for the rambling; I'm high and this is a subject I'm passionate about.     \nOther ways to support artists that cost ZERO MONEY!      \n-If you use someone's art as an icon btw please credit @them in your bios and such!     \n-If you see art and you like it, check to see if you can tell who made it! Is there a watermark? A signature? If so, is this the person that posted it? If not, take 25 seconds to track down the original post via google or even sometimes the comments. It sounds silly but it's SO significant so if you take the time to do this then you rock\n-Let others know when they share from the wrong source! If you provide the original link people generally will gladly take down the incorrect post and throw up the one you gave       \n       \nSorry to hijack your comment.

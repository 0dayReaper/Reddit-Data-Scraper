Turn off all other light sources in your studio and blast the tattoo with a strong, preferably white light with a polarizing filter.\n\nI took the cover off of a ring light, cut a polarizing sheet to size and secured it with good old electrical tape. Have been using it for about a year and it\u2019s fool proof.\n\nThat\u2019s how you get these rich blacks and get rid of the glare. After that, I usually just adjust brightness and contrast and lower the saturation a tiny bit if necessary in either Lightroom or insta. The pitch black is thanks to the light and filter I use while taking the photos. It does look more natural when I take healed photos with the same set up but fresh black turns out pretty much like vanta.",

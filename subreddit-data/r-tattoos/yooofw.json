            "comment": "I'm posting as the artist, not the client. My client is a breast cancer survivor with reconstruction surgery from a double masectomy.  She was left with scarring from the removal of her nipples that she wanted to cover with tattooing. She requested an octopus on one breast and a lotus flower on the other. Total tattoo time was about 18 hours over six sessions. The lotus flower side is also a coverup of some previous tattooing that she was unhappy with. I find it very rewarding helping my clients heal their spiritual wounds with this kind of tattoo art. Thanks for looking!",

Along the scar line, I can\u2019t really feel anything, but the upper curve of my breast leading to my chest is very sensitive and gets sore still (I\u2019m 11 months post mastectomy and 6 months post implant placement). I have a card for an artist who does nipples but I am actually planning to do something like in this post. Soooo pretty and OP\u2019s work is beautiful!",

But after all is said and done, it was 100% worth it. I'm finally happy when I look in the mirror for the first time since I had my first surgery in 2009. \n\nThanks to my tattoo artist for spending all that time making it perfect! I couldn't be happier.",

They then took some skin grafts from her belly as well, to put in place where the nipples were.  Other areas where they removed more breast tissue, they just sewed up, and you can see some scars on the sides from that.  So while she had a mastectomy, it was done with reconstruction right from the get-go.  All of this of course was after a full round of radiation as well as chemo, which luckily she survived.  All of that was done around 2009, so she's carried these scars a long time.\n\nBefore the ink, her breasts had soft white patches where the nipples used to be.  You could just barely make out where the areolas used to extend to.  They are pretty natural looking and feeling, because it's her own tissue in there, and not implants.",

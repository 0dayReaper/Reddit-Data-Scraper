They're colloquially known as 'job stoppers' for a reason. \n\nObviously most artists, unless you're friends with them, know nothing about your lifestyle and whether tattoos are acceptable at your workplace, and someone with no tattoos is way more likely to get buyer's regret over a placement that could potentially  lead to discrimination than anyone else who is already covered.\n\nThat said, we on Reddit don't know your relationship with your artist either, and if you were both comfortable then go for it. Its a job well done from the picture \ud83d\ude0a",

I like the size but like someone said the spread out part is odd. Maybe we need to see the rest of it to get the full perspective. The head being on the hand is cool af. Like someone else said the scales and the solid lines are a bit odd. No issue, maybe if you get it touched up after a while.\n\nPeople are saying job stopper but more like parent disappointer \ud83d\ude06 \ud83e\udd23 at least for me",

The belly scales shouldn\u2019t be a hard straight line. There should be no straight lines. Everything should lightly curve as it wraps around.  Love the head. There is a place for flat tattoos, but it just doesn\u2019t work here. Its such a cool idea that could have jumped off your arm with a better artist.",

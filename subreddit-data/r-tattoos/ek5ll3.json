I've had scars on my wrist covered up but that didn't particularly hurt any more than the tattoos on my other wrist.  \nA broader scar might have more an effect on whether the ink takes since scar tissue is smoother than regular skin. And if it's in a particularly sensitive area then I'd naturally assume that the scar is yet even more sensitive and that it'd simply hurt a lot more than usual.",

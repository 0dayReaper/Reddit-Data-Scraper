As far as this kind of work goes, it seems like a fairly easy touch up as long as the colors don't bleed and blur too much. Also if the tattoo is in a lower traffic area, it will hold up longer. Look up fresh vs. aged tattoos. The water color ones fade badly. Super detailed line work does too. ",

Regardless of the style good tattoos will have clean, even lines and shading.

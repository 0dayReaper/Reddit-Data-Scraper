I\u2019ve had several perspective changed throughout this whole process, and one of the big reminders that I got was that nobody said life was fair.  So I\u2019ve been choosing to look at it all in a positive light, and I\u2019m prioritizing my health and well-being moving forward, so I don\u2019t have to go through this type of shit again.

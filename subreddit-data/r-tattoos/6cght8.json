It's definitely very loose and almost unfinished looking, but the linework is strong and was put in very deliberately, despite the sketchiness. He used gaps and varied the line weights but still was able to put together a very clean image.",

A pig? Cow? Squirrel? Prairie dog? I can'tthink of much that is distinctly north american either by zoological means (naming) or by geographical means (range of habitat around the world), or even insults about the American love affair with food and large portions.  For example, I find consuming such *copious* amounts of red meat to be distinctly American, despite cultures all around the world having such beef dishes.\n\n\nI feel like the Canadian one could've gone with a miniature moose isntead of beaver, as well. But either work.  \n\n\n\nEdit: on that note, I think an American r/totallynotrobots would be an anthropomorphised deep fryer riding on an anthropomorphic m1 Abrams or Sherman.  The fryer to depict the American love affair with food and frying shit to make it taste better, and the tank to represent its militarism on a global scale",

Canada isn't a global behemoth like the US, we don't take ourselves that seriously. It's ok to be silly about your country without advocating imperialism or cultural domination. This tattoo takes a bit of the Pisa out of Canada, if anything. We acknowledge we're not \"the greatest\" or \"the strongest\" and we try to include criticism of ourselves as part of our culture. I really don't think you can think of something like this as nationalist at all. \n\nThat is just my opinion, though, apologies. ",

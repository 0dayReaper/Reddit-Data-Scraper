They're free and the whole event is about 6 hours of total fun. The actors introduce themselves before the show and sometimes play games with the audience. A comedian entertains the crowd between takes. You get to see famous people screw up big-time and everyone laughs. I have a script of the That 70s Show episode I saw signed by the whole cast (except Topher Grace, who was busy working with the director.) Meeting Tommy Chong was dope!\n\nI also saw Everybody Loves Raymond and a dating gameshow pilot that never got picked up (called Best Friends). My sister saw Friends and I think Dharma &amp; Greg. If you ever plan to visit LA go online and see what's available. I don't know what sites to check, but if Mom figured it out then so can you. Same thing with late night shows filmed in NYC. I've never won the SNL or Seth Myers or Conan ticket lotteries, but new tickets go up every few months on the shows' websites. Check regularly and you'll get in. \n\n[PROOF](https://imgur.com/a/qQZjI)\n\nEDIT--[Here's an image of the script with a legible name next to each signature](https://imgur.com/a/un4fL). I had to recreate this based on googling signatures and trying to remember events from 18 years ago, so please correct me if I mislabeled any. ",

I've never seen that episode on TV, but I don't recall what we as an audience sounded like so even if I saw it I wouldn't be able to parse out which parts of the audio were authentic. There was nobody in the audience with a particularly recognizable laugh or anything like that. \n\nOne thing about audience laughter that interested me came when a producer spoke to the crowd right before filming started. She explained that we were going to see many of the episode's scenes filmed 2 or 3 times, and requested that we \"laugh like it's the first time every time.\" So during the first take of a scene the laughter was totally genuine, but during subsequent takes it was sorta half-real/half-acted (though it's not hard to laugh at a joke a second time when funny actors are performing well 20 feet from you).\n\nAnother producer instruction that struck me as interesting at the time came after Tommy Chong's introductory seen. He was not among the actors who introduced themselves before the shoot, so we had no idea he was going to be a guest on the episode. When he first entered the scene, the crowd went wild with surprised applause. The director called cut, and a producer addressed us saying, \"We understand your enthusiasm for Tommy Chong, but please express your appreciation for him inwardly.\" It came off to me as quite condescending. Especially the producer's tone of voice, which sounded infantilizing. I wish they'd just said, \"Please don't applaud for Tommy because it doesn't fit the scene.\" ",

I had Yoshimi (and a few other precious favorites) on loop for a whole summer in my lab in college back before getting a group of my best friends together to go to Lollapalooza '06. Seeing them live there was personally life changing. Completely sober standing there in the middle of everything around me, Wayne in a hamster ball above me while I held his foot, just buzzing with the world around me. That was the first time in my life I felt okay with the idea of death. I wasn't even facing down my own mortality. It was just a moment for me. If you haven't been there for it, I think you'd get even more out of it than me. Congrats, by the way. The world is better to have you a bit longer. Hope you're enjoying it.",

OP\u2019s tattoo is neither. \n\nAlso to even further nitpick the traditional handle butt is like the one on the first blade you sent, with that little rounded out bit. OP\u2019s looks like an axe handle that flares out wider to the end. Also the oval grain on the wood makes absolutely no sense either. It\u2019s technically well executed but the design choices are strange.  ",

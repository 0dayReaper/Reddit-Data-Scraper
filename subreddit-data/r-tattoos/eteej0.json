I find tattoos fun and fascinating, and while I'm fine with the idea of being tattooed, I'm having a paradoxical time with deciding on a tattoo.\n\nTattoos are art, just like a painting, but I have a hard time deciding what permanent art I want on me, to the point that I can't find the \"perfect\" piece of art to put on myself.  The idea of \"throwaway\" tattoos are just abhorrent to me.  I remember when my later-to-be-wife and I were dating and she got her dragon back piece from a shop (that I later went back to to get some cartridge piercings) and while I was out in the lobby area, two of the artists, it was a slow day, were talking and one of them said, \"Hey why don't you just do this on me\" and pointed to some simple star tat in a book.  Needless to say, these two were giddy to tattoo each other because they were *bored*.\n\nI feel like art, and thus tattoos, should be more sacred than that, but I try to understand that, just like art, tattoos are in the eye of the beholder, and it would be shitty of me to think less of someone just because they were a little more brazen in their love of art than I am.\n\nNeedless to say, I'm still apprehensive about getting a tattoo, strictly from the point of view that I'm not sure if I could ever settle on something \"worthy\" of being permanently etched into my skin.",

I hate seeing how all these small single needle tattoos are getting so many up votes, while very good traditional, new school, Japaneses, black and grey (pretty much anything but small single needle) get less then 100? Yes, they may look awsome now. Yes, the artist has talent as a illustrator, no argument there. But as a tattoo, it is not going to age well. But for some reason people love them, my guess is because they don't look like \"real tattoos\". If that is the case, don't get a tattoo. Also these people are pretty much getting scam, the artist charge high prices for these small single needles, and they'll look like shit in two years. Line tattoos are kind of cool, but they should be big with thick lines.",

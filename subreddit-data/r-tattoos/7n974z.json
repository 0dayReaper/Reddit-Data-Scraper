What REALLY bothers me is the shaky line-work overall, alongside the differing gaps between the dots of both the sun and the moon in both tattoo's. That left moon has some shaping issues in comparison to the sun.\n\nIt really needs to be said that you get what you pay for. Although ankle tattoo's are hard to complete due to bone structure, basic artist skills such as smooth line work and an even distribution of elements within a tattoo should still be able to shine through, even on a hard body tattoo location. It's a shame that the tattoo artist has some really evident mistakes here on these amazing tattoo designs :/\n",

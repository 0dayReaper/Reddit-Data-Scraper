I am just wondering if that is typically something that an artist may advise against.  (and I assuming it is due to how it changes over your lifetime).",

All tattoos are going to change over the lifetime, it\u2019s just how skin is. For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m not a tattoo artist, but someone who is tattooed.",

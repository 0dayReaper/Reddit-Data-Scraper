Unfortunately I am not sure if he is accepting new clients. He has a waitlist and I was lucky enough to meet him in person randomly around town and talk to him and he got me in. If you\u2019re interested the email on his IG handle is the way to go to see if his waitlist is open or not.\n\n2. After our chance encounter in the wild, it was about 4-5months before I was able to get in for an appointment. And for reference, I had this done in Nov 2022, originally I was going to get the next appt in March of this year but due to some scheduling issues on my end I won\u2019t be go in again until Aug 2023.\n\n3. My appointment was 5 hours long. Since it was my first tattoo I didn\u2019t know what to expect. He made the whole process go so smoothly. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better experience. We chatted for most that time and it felt effortless to hold a conversation with him and I\u2019m normally a shy person. I never once felt awkward or uncomfortable. He does give you the option to listen to headphones if you want but honestly didn\u2019t even think about it. 10/10",

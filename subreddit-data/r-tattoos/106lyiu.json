It's detailed just right - without going overboard into the so heavily realistic that it comes off weird. Something similar to when photographers - I have a habit of doing this - over edit a photo and it ruins the beauty. \n\nThis was spot on with the design! Someone else mentioned liking the dragons' faces and I have to agree they are lovely to look at in comparison to the very aggressive style we get from fantasy movies and other media. They actually remind me a lot of the Soul Collectors from Inuyasha though they were apparently \"insects\" of a sort. Maybe it's the frills and horns. Either way they are a peaceful and more wisdom focused type of dragon and less of the greedy monster we usually end up seeing. Weaving amongst the flowers also adds to that peaceful feeling and draws me more into my Inuyasha reference. If you haven't seen it they fly in a very fluid motion as though they are swimming through the sky rather than truly flying. \n\nJust a wonderful piece overall and happy you got something you could be pleased with! Major props to your artist as well because making two mirrored images would be so stressful for me. I have a hard time keeping one thing symmetrical and couldn't even begin to imagine doing it twice while also having it flipped - the stencil be damned.",

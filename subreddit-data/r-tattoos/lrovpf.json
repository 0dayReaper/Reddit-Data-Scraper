A weeks or so before my move out date, I found a bunny in a box on the corner. So I took it home, because my next place didn\u2019t have a pet policy. Bunnies make good indoor pets and they can be litter box trained really easily.\n\nLike 2 days later the landlord found the rabbit and kicked me out that day. She didn\u2019t give me a \u201cfix it or leave\u201d or even a \u201c3 days notice\u201d, she just started to throw my stuff out on the lawn. And then charge me all these stupid things so she wouldn\u2019t have to return my security deposit. \n\nSo I got yelled at for having a pet. But I also got my deposit back and got paid to be on the show. \n\nBehind the scenes stuff:\n\nThe show pays the ruling, not the defendant. So when I walked of set and they wrote me a check. \n\nThey also claimed that the would provide me with a script-ish but they lied\n\nAnd when I was in hair/make up they would try to say things to get me mad. Like \u201coh the landlord said this\u201d.",

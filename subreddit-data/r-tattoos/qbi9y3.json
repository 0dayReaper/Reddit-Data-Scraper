But it's one of those things about tattoos, do you get it and know it looks fucking awesome now but it might not look great in 10-12 years or do you try to play it kinda safe so it looks good for as long as possible.",

Thats not cool because its really beautiful but people need to understand that this is skin and your body regenerates/heals itself so you have to do your homework if you want your tattoo to last more than 3-5 years and still be good looking. The artist have to explain this to you and not just do it even if he/she is skilled for that kind of tattoo. If you are ok with it then all good.",

I think some artists today are sometimes being disingenuous with their clients about the longevity of their work . I think the lure of getting hits on social media and bringing in new clients is pushing some artists to do work they know won't last more than a year or two. Just my thoughts.",

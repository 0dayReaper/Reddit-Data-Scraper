Hope you love it for a long time!\n\nReal quick, just want to clarify something...and disclaimer: I say this as a bro because I want to make the future u/KazakX look super in-the-know about art at cocktail parties.\n\nThe word \"deconstruction\" or \"deconstructed\" within the art world is very specific, and actually doesn't mean \"pulled apart\" or \"split into various abstract components.\" Lots of people use it that way, especially on like cooking shows and shit, but that usage is actually a complete slippage from what deconstruction really is in terms of art.\n\nDeconstruction has to do with the re-framing of presumed binary systems. An artwork or an argument might offer deconstructions of a particular system (like gender, or class, or race) where power dynamics are assumed. In flipping or breaking step with the expected assumptions, the statement or artwork can serve to \"deconstruct\" the system. Super stupid explanation, but basically I would offer words like \"shattered\" or \"dissected\" or \"exploded\" or \"abstracted\" etc. instead of deconstructed. \n\nAnd of course, by all means take this with a grain of salt because I'm just some rando painter on the internet. Again, cool image. \n\nBe well!",

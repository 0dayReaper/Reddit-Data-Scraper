OP's friends name is Pat, and we used to work together in a music store in central MD a few years back. He got transfered to another location a few months later, but last I'd seen of him, before I stopped using FB so much, he'd gone into remission. \n\nPat was probably one of the more interesting and eccentric people I've come across. He was filled with a ton of energy. Willing to help anyone do anything. He just had a big heart and loved people. And a real passion for music, to the point that it was almost obsessive. We weren't very close, as we had different personalities and interests, but I also had a lot of respect for him as being an individual with his own path. He didn't care if something was \"embarassing\" or \"uncool.\" If he wanted to do it, he did it, regardless of what others thought. \n\nIt's just so sad to see this. To see what cancer how cancer can cut life like this. He couldn't have been more than 25, and probably spent most of his prime adulthood in cancer treatment. Just another lesson that we shouldn't take life for granted. What were too lazy to do whole were healthy, others wish they could even attempt. Great way to honor Pat OP. He did have a great nose. Killer hair too. Wish he was still with us. ",

He and I shared the same circle of friends for many years. I would always go over to his house to help him make movies for short film competitions, listen to his music or just hang out. To this day, I can't hear the band RPWL without thinking of Patrick. He gave me their CD probably 10 years ago, but it's one of my most cherished memories of him. \n\nVery strange to see your friend posted on reddit, but I'm glad everyone is able to see what an awesome guy he was. He'll truly be missed and I'm glad you were able to spend time with him too. \n\nRIP Patrick. I'll never forget your exploding yogurt. ",

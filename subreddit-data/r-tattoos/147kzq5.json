Yes it's meant to look silly, wonky, and doodle like- I like the ignorant style of tattooing\n2. Yes it looks faded in the photo but the photo was back lit by a window so it's blown out. It is truly black in person\n3. I literally just got a walk in appointment and I was delighted with the service I received. Please stop making negative comments about the artist because they did exactly what I asked for. \n4. I am absolutely in love with it and would change nothing about my little cow\n5.

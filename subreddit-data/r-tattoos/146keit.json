There is so much open space left in the upper half of the skull. Why not have taken just a few liberties? Perhaps having added some more lines and soft shading throughout? Just a little more worked throughout the upper half of the piece? It\u2019s important for the piece to have more contrast and dimension. I\u2019m very much of the idea that less is more but this doesn\u2019t look or feel finished. Even when compared to the original work. It\u2019s a great idea and it\u2019s a good start.",

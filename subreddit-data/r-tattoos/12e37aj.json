Honestly stopped \"seeing\" my sleeves about a  decade ago and sadly I rarely remember the lone one on my shoulder blade. Usually at the beach people will remind me and then I can just pretend it's brand new :) \n\nJust now occuring to me that I haven't gotten any work done in 20+ years. My artist and shop are still in same place though....not sure if this sub is good or bad for me lol. ALSO....that tattoo on your shoulder is absolutely perfect!! I love it!",

Finding an artist who I\u2019m confident in and trust to mark my body has been the biggest reason why I haven\u2019t gotten tatted yet, I need to be 1000% sure I picked the right person for the job. I have no desire to rush into anything. Like you said, I think I\u2019ll be much more confident in going under the gun once I find someone I trust. Thanks again, I hope you\u2019re loving the shit out of your badass tattoo!",

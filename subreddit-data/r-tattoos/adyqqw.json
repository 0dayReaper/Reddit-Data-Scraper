Fill their ice wells, empty garbages, retrieve product from the cooler etc if they need. Learn to change kegs. Offer to rotate said kegs. Basically always be there for the bartenders when you aren't bussing or running food.  Don't expect anyone to teach you how to make drinks or pour beer.  Memorize all menu items and get you basic drinks down. KNOW about current sports even if you don't give a shit. If cocaine is an accepted vice among staff make sure to quit and find a better establishment. I've seen that stuff slowly move thru a restaurant and once the management are on it you gotta bail.  \n\nOne day.... a bartender will fuck up or quit.\n\nYou will have made yourself the next logical guy/girl to cover shifts.  Even if it's one shift a week you ROCK that shit. \n\nDon't fuck up.   Don't steal even tho it's easy AF.  Learn the true purpose of a coffee mug. ;) \n\n Never be the oldest guy at the after parties....  that's when you retire. \n\nSOURCE: (Was bartender for too long) ",

Muddling limes and mint up the ying yang. If I knew it was gonna be an insanely understaffed night I would come in early, say high to my brothers on the kitchen line then go into the walk in and secretly confiscate the mint.  Then 'lose' it til Saturday brunch.    Sorry guys we are out of mint!   Awwww !  But my customer KAREN wants a mojito SO bad!\n\n      Sounds horrible to do but not so insane when you are a hungover bartender (running 16 on ypur wood and 1/2 the lounge) looking for a smooth night without glass in your well.

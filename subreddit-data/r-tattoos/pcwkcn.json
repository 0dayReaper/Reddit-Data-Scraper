I'll take thick linework in my belly button all damn day over getting it on my abs. Like, the upper 4 pack we have? that shit was almost unbearable. Never left a table so sweaty in my whole life. Like, other parts of my body were getting zapped with pain, my leg was twitching. It was a whole other level of \"what the fuck.\" \n\nLike, I got into a bike wreck once, and I remember sliding for like, 50 feet on my belly. I remember feeling that road rash, being powerless to stop it, and just closing my eyes and thinking, \"Boy, this is uncomfortable.\" THAT was NOTHING like getting that area tattooed. Holy fuck. And I STILL have to go back and finish it.",

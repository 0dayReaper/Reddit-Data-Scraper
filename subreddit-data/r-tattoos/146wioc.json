I've seen great art placed in a weird spot that doesn't line up with the anatomy and as a result was not a great tattoo, and vice versa. For most people, a hand tattoo with empty space above just looks odd. You may not feel that way. That's the great thing about opinions! (And to the OP, sleeves are a process and lord knows I've had some awkward spots while waiting for things to come together. I don't mean any hate and the tattoo is sick and I'm sure will look dope with the sleeve!)",

It's my guess that the patch effect goes away and you're left with a tattoo that has big black outlines and chunky areas of colors that slightly gradient. Kindof like a traditional tattoo.\n\nI bet these patch tattoos end up looking much better in a decade than the water color effect tattoos that used to be trendy a couple years ago.\n\nI'm a r/all lurker, so I have no experience with anything.",

I'm curious about how long it'll be before the first touchup is needed in comparison to others.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see how these hold up after a decade (same with micro tatts), as the style is fairly novel. I dig it, 100%, though hope more artists start asking for healed photos from their clients to post. I love seeing comparison photos of fresh vs healed (unedited ones, for the love of God); especially with the more unique styles.",

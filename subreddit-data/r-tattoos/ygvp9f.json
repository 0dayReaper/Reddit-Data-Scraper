It's very detailed and with lots of color. Artist explained to me it's has to be bigger to get detail, should I just get it simplified if I don't want it bigger?",

I was scrolling this sub when I was getting my last tattoo and came across a really small tattoo with incredible detail and asked the artist the same thing (will it blur together after a few years). I think it was the China teapot tattoo. \n\nHe said that the tech for tattoos has come a a long way in recent years so it should be fine to get something small and detailed as long as the artist was capable. \n\nI would suggest going to a few artists and see what they think. As always, you get what you pay for when it comes to tattoos. So if you want to get something really detailed then you will pay for it.",

It's really up to your personal preference of if you'd rather have the detail or would rather it be under a certain size. I always say to truat the artist's judgment. They know what will and what won't work. They'll be able to explain what you need the best. They should be happy to answer any questions/concerns you might have, if not, then they're the wrong artist for you.",

Graphic novel + DC comics \n\nI'm admittedly out of the loop for 4, but this is my understanding of the situation.",

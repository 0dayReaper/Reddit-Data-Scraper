Entropy and the 2nd law of thermodynamics are statistical in nature and kind of don't exist at the quantum scale.  Systems tend to move towards states of higher entropy, but that progress is in reality a bit jittery due to the randomness of the momentum of the involved particles.  Kind of like the stock market: if you zoom out to look at the S&amp;P 500 over the last year it's trending steadily upwards, but zoom into a single day and it'll be constantly going up and down.\n\nThat's the basis behind quantum tunneling.  In classical mechanics an alpha particle (2 protons + 2 neutrons) would never have enough energy to escape a large atom's nucleus, but because its position is statistical and the distribution of possible positions has non-zero probability throughout the _entire universe_, the particle can violate classic thermodynamics and escape the nucleus as alpha radiation (overwhelmingly often the tunneling occurs very close to the nucleus, so you're unlikely to be bombarded by radiation emitted from atoms far away, but it is technically possible).\n\nSo when it comes to the heat death of the universe, it is true at the macro scale we will see the universe approach a state of near uniform density and energy, but at the quantum scale things will still be jittering and bouncing around.  But there is a very, very, very small probability that enough particles will suddenly and simultaneously tunnel together and essentially recreate the big bang.  It would literally be the least probable thing to ever occur in the universe, but if you have an infinite amount of time who cares!  It will _eventually_ happen.",

I think it is easier to understand than entropy itself.\n\nThink of putting salt in a glass of water. At first, the salt is concentrated locally. There is a gradient of salinity throughout the glass - it differs by location.\n\nAnd gradients of all kinds are sources of usable energy. Mainly heat - on a relatively cold earth, we heat fluids in powerplants to make power. This, on a very basic level, is possible because of the temperature difference, the temperature *gradient*.\n\nBack to the glass of water. With time the salinity will spread out evenly throughout the water. There will be no gradient any more. It will reach an equilibrium.\n\nAnd that is what happens to the universe. Entropy is the driving \"force\" for everything in the universe slowly going towards such an equilibrium, with no gradients left. With no usable energy - there won't be any kinds of reactions. Everything will be cold and still and dark. (A part of me wonders if time exists in a static universe. It will be essentially an image.)\n\nIt is possible to lower entropy in a closed limited environment, but only by increasing the entropy outside of it. But this just buys more time. Of which there is very much left. The heat death of the universe is so unimaginably far away, that it will never affect humans - we will probably die out, and if not, humans will have mutated too much to be considered a current human. I guess the sad part is not that it might affect us, but that even something grand as the universe will come to an end. With life or without it, the universe is a fascinating and beautiful place, even with no one being able to experience it.\n\nIf anyone knows how the age of the universe in relation to the heat death time, I would like to know it. I guess the universe is like below 0.000000000000000001% of reaching it.\n\nBtw, all of this is under the assumption that the universe is finite and that entropy always increases. We only know of the *observable* universe, what's beyond we will never know. And entropy increasing is a law in thermodynamics, with currently no basis to believe that it might change. This law is rather basic, and it breaking would mean, for example, that a cold object could spontaneously transfer it's net-positive energy (like heat) to a warmer object. This has never been observed - in total heat always goes where it's colder, not where it's hotter. (But science changes with human progress so who knows.) \n\nBut if we believe the universe had a start, it seems plausible to *believe* that it also has an end. Maybe it's ok. People come and go. Friends and family. And we have to accept it eventually that a persons life is limited. It has a start and an end. Maybe it's a law more universal than we think it is.",

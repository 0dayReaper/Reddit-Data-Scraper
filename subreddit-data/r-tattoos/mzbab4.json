I basically just walked up to random strangers in Vancouver and asked them if they would be down. The second person I asked was Geran and he was immediately down, literally such a dope dude.  \n\n\nThe idea was we would share a bonding experience before the tattoo. So I brought him to do my favourite thing which is paintball, and he brought me to his MMA gym and we did some sparring! And then from there we went and got the tattoos! \n\nWe still stay in contact and my girlfriend is actually helping him with his nutrition for his upcoming fight!",

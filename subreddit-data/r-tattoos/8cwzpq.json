This guy Monica is seeing is absolutely a high-functioning alcoholic and out of concern she asks him to get help. Once he cleans up he becomes so boring that Monica develops a drinking problem just to stand being around him. He dumps her because he doesn't want to date an alcoholic.\n\nMy sister is a high functioning alcoholic and I worry about what's going to happen when she decides to have children. ",

I think the difference with painkillers is that even dosing once daily would cause significant physical and psychological dependence.\n\n\n\n**I'm in no way endorsing having a \"few beers a night\".

Do you ever have a drink first thing in the morning to dull a hangover? If you answer \"yes\" to any one of these questions you have alcohol dependency.

If you just really like trying different beers, or you enjoy the ritual of pouring a small sherry before dinner, or you enjoy a glass of wine while you debrief your day with your partner/roomie/friend, or you decompress with a cider, I would say those are all perfectly fine. \n\nIf you *need* a fixed number of drinks every day to handle your feelings, or you don't know why but you can't go a day without it even if it's a relatively small amount, that's no bueno. \n\nAs with most things, it's about motivation and context. Someone who had sex with their partner once a day wouldn't necessarily be a sex addict; someone who eats a chocolate bar every day on their break doesn't necessarily have a food addiction that's going to balloon into compulsive binge-eating... but it's certainly worth keeping an eye on.

Besides school, that\u2019s like, *literally* all I did\n\n5 years later, I have many more hobbies, have way more experiences, travel more, more open minded, have more friends, and live an altogether more interesting lifestyle.

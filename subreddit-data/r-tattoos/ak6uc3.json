I follow and read but I almost never read the comments. Also NOT actuallesbians. I read and follow but there's a heavy level of biphobia in there and the comments will slay me occasionally\n\nThere's a mom support subreddit that's like fight club, we're not allowed to mention it to prevent the judgemental moms from getting in there. There's also some other queer subreddits I won't mention because they don't need any negative attention and I love offering as much love and support and encouragement as I can to my community\n\nThere's places that are soaking in positivity here, you just have to find your spaces, much like in the the real world. Pretty much anything that makes it to the front page has a high level of \"well, actually\"\n\nWhen a meme I posted made it to the front page, about a coworker not realizing I was married to another guy we both worked with, like 50 people accused me of cheating on my husband. What the fuck, internet. What the fuck.\n\nJust gotta learn that a lot of people thinking the same thing doesn't make it right. Sometimes it just makes a lot of people wrong. Sometimes humans can be jealous, petty, viscous fucks, and the rest of us go around cleaning up their messes\n\n",

That's cool!\" just to find the comments downright degrading.\n\nFuck that. Your tattoo looked amazing before I read the comments and it looks amazing after.

I even didn't notice all the bits these guys are rattling on about.  You said it was important to you that it was done by the specific artist, that's what's important, not some robotic precision.  It suits you're frame really well, I think you chose a lovely piece that you should be really happy with.  I get that this is a subreddit full of professional artists who are going to be hyper critical, but somewhere they've lost the personal feeling a tattoo should have; it's yours, like your body, imperfections and all, you're unique and so is your art. The picture is really beautifully done too. ",

The lines are a little off in spots, and the very bottom is lopsided but you can always tweak it, to even it out in time. Some shading may trick the eye.\nCongrats on your 1st sit and ink tho! I don\u2019t think it will be long before you get another, somewhere you\u2019ll be able to enjoy it and see it yourself a bit easier. \n\n* now that you got your 1st tat by the guy who had to do it, i recommend seeking artists for their styles according to what you\u2019d like done.

The design is great, the line design/execution is great, but I don't get how the planets shaped up how they did. Also Jupiter looks amazing, how are the tiny ones misshaped. Overall, I love the tattoo, but it perplexes me.",

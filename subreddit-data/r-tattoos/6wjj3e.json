I will say that it's definitely more Simple Math than COPE but the album is very different overall.\n\nHe uses a lot more production in this album than any other album, and he takes a lot of the techniques he learned making the Swiss Army Man soundtrack and applies it to the new album.  If you have ever wondered how Andy Hull would use synth's in an MO album, the new album answers the question.  \n\nPersonally, the strength of the new album is the whole of it's parts, if you listen to the songs piecemeal I think it'll be harder for you to enjoy it.   I think it's an excellent album that really showcases the strengths of MO and the continued development of their sound. Just my 2 cents.",

I imagine this album being a continuation of Devil and God, where he's turned from religion in context of a lot of what was written in this album. It's probably one of their darkest albums, and you can see he's still struggling with what \"god\" is to him. In the song Desert, I see it as a man who is so blinded by faith he wouldn't even stand by his son's path, and it has so much hatred in the lyrics but it ends with the line \"god is love.\" It's a fascinating album really.",

Maybe it was because of my age and where they were in life. YFW was when I was dealing with relationship crap. DE was when I was trying to figure out who I was in the grand scheme of things. TDaG came out when I was questioning what I truly believed in, even though I was brought up very religious. Daisy was the exception. Sounds like this one might be a good listen as well. I could use it right about now. ",

All it takes are a couple of good blowouts or the lines thickening over time for things to go wrong.",

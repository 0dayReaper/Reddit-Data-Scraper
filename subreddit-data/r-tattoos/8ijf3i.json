I was always under the impression that the sun can only cause it to fade but as long as the black and color blocking is done properly it shouldn't be too hard to touch up. I recently got a tattoo on my arm that I doubt will be hard to touch up (I already need to go back into the shop soon anyway because my skin always makes tattoos blotchy and I need a second pass on a couple) but does sunlight cause the ink to bleed faster or just lose its tone?

Grit your teeth, get it done, cause it will look badass in the end and you will be stoked, get it over with.\n\nThe worst I've got is the hip, like, the inside. The lower interior pelvic part of your ribs. Absolutely horrible. And the artist just drove it home too, the piece is great, and I love it, but I didn't fucking love it then, I wanted to punch that motherfucker in the mouth.\n\nEdit: dude, you had your ditch tattooed, heavy, you can take a rib tatt, it's not that bad. Ditch is more sensitive and way harder to tattoo. Ribs hurt, but they are a good canvas. TLDR, ribs suck, ditch is way worse.",

It was interesting how his young mind interpreted it, and those elements were incorporated to represent my family.  When I first met my wife when we were kids, I had a very difficult family situation/life and she helped me through and we always stuck by one another.  In sum, the rigged ship represents persevering through a difficult journey and arriving 'home' to the family we've started together.  ",

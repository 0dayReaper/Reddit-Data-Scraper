This sub can be a little prickly about the truly objective qualities within tattoo work.\n\nSPF 50 may not be any more powerful than SPF 30, but you bet your ass I slather myself in that shit anytime the sun is out and I want my sleeves to be shown.  In general I don't spend much time in the sun which helps me out, but here's a list of things that will make your tattoos age faster than they already will:\n\n \u2022 ~~Itching~~ Scratching -- just don't. If you have to, slap it. Never ~~itch~~ scratch.\n\n\u2022 Sunlight -- huge culprit. Sunscreen, or clothes, or sometimes both. Think of what it does to stickers on your car, then apply that to your ink.\n\n\u2022 Any kind of physical stress on the skin. So, if you put a tatt on your ass it's guaranteed to age more quickly than just about anywhere else. \n\n\u2022 Dryness -- In general I really don't know if the dryness of your skin affects how the tatt ages, but it certainly can't hurt to lotion up and the work does objectively look better when your skin is not dry.\n\n\u2022 Time -- All tattoos age. All of them, they're not permanent in the way people are led to believe by conservative crackpots. The ink WILL spread, and it WILL get lighter. You antibodies are trying to work through that shit from the moment the artist slams it into you.  So, BOLD WILL HOLD. High quality and strong line work I would hazard to say is more important than anything else. It sets the base for the rest of the work to be held up by. In general large pieces with good spacing between the lines that is made to have expanded details through shading is best in my experience. Traditional has been around for a long time for a reason, and Neo-Traditional is taking those techniques and modernizing them for a more evolved taste in today. \n\nI have a considerable bias against things like realism and watercolor for this reason.\n\nI, also, personally have a large bias against color. I just don't think it holds as well and I think the person's skin as contrast for the art is far more interesting than the cotton candy type shit that is what color pieces look to me. Also don't believe from what I have seen that color ages anywhere near as well as black &amp; grey. Though, white definitely has its uses in keeping fine black details from blurring together as quickly.\n\nGuess I felt like writing about tatts today. \n\nEdit: Learn something new every day. ",

So hard lines don't happen as much.\n\nI feel like without good, hard, linework for your antibodies to really focus on trying to age faster -- then the whole of the work will age much more quickly.\n\nIn my experience Traditional &amp; Neo-Traditional tattoos with good, bold linework as a basis age the best for this reason. \n\nSofter tatts without strong linework get processed by the antibodies quite a bit quicker it seems.\n\nAll sounds like pseudo-science when I type it out like that.. but that's my belief on seeing how different tattoos age after 28 years on the planet. \n\n&gt;I\u2019m planning out a full sleeve that will be rife with hard, straight lines and technical details\n\nThat sounds more like geometrical/neo-traditional to me, so should be fine. I really like geometric stuff, too. But one has to go into it knowing that that body&amp; skin are not a geometric canvas and so the final product will have flaws. (like any tattoo will, but often even moreso)",

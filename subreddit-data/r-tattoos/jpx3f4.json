My oldest brother Andrew (hence the \u201cA\u201d) is severely physically and mentally handicapped, and Winnie the Pooh has always been his thing. So, since he could never do anything as impulsive and free as getting a random tattoo, I did it for him. My Dad *hates* tattoos but when he saw this one he burst out crying and *loves* it lol",

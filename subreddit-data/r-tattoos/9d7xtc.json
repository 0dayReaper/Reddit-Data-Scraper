However, if you have quality work done, its quality will last longer. OPs tattoo has some good spots to it, but a lot of the line work will not hold up as well as other better works. 5-10 years isn't too long but depending on the quality of work some tattoos may still look relatively fresh. If care is taken seriously post-work with healing and making sure you keep your art out of direct sunlight, it'll last a lot longer.",

With tattoos you're supposed to love what you put on your body but at the same time are willing to be criticized about every aspect of the tattoo. It seems many people in the thread loves Vinny's work including yourself and that's cool. However, to be frank, it isn't the best.

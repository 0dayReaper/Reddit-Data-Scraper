    "postText": "This was done about a year and a half ago by the most experienced artist in my super small Estonian town. I have no friends so there is no one to share my many tattoos with so I have no idea whether the dude does a good job or not. My colleagues, girlfriend, and daughter love the tats though so all good I guess. Still, would love to hear a 'professional' opinion.",

Have a scar along my collarbone after a break 2 years ago and always wanted to do something with it! Really like this one!\n\n\nEdit: based on everyone's replies this probably isn't from arthroscopic surgery for more minor and/or superior labral tears because they leave three separate, small scars; two anteriorly and one posteriorly.\n\nScars like this seem to be more indicative of surgery to stabilise the shoulder following repeated subluxations/dislocations like a Bankart repair (which if we were gonna be pedantic is still arthroscopic surgery of the labrum but is more related to anterior-inferior labral damage that allows the shoulder to dislocate). Really interesting to hear back from so many people who have had similar surgeries. Thanks for the replies!",

When I had the labrum tear it actually coincided with a baseball player I was following, he had a tear early in the season and was able to make it back before the season ended. Anyway a guy like him showed that it was possible, so I used it as a mentality when I rehabbed. I had most of my mobility in the 4-5 week post op, I started rebuilding stability in months 2-3, months 3-5 of rehab I started to test my confidence with little bits of weight as a cheat outside of rehab and by 6 months that shoulder was the stronger of the two. It did come with challenges even in the first year I would lift and feel some odd discomfort but I was assured it was more likely scar tissue as it was structurally sound. I thought that I would have strange pains and aches with the shoulder but shoot I\u2019m nearly 5 years removed from the shoulder repair and I haven\u2019t had any bother.",

I am 43 and they said that if you aren't in your 20's they rarely try to reattach or fix the labrum. Mine was torn so that when my bicep flexed it pulled on the tear. The tendonesis consists of the actually cutting the bicep tendon from the labrum and reattaching it with a screw into your upper arm. So if you can live with it.. live with it. The rehab took a year and it's still keeping me out of the gym other than to hit the treadmill, and just getting there took 6 months. ",

I didn't have a labrum tear, instead my bicept was sliding out of the groove, causing it to pull on all my other muscles. So they moved the ucept, and scoped the shoulder. After the first three months of therapy I had hit a wall with my ROM (very little ROM), and ended up changing therapists. The new therapist has been brutal but in less than 3 months I have 98% of my ROM back, and we are working on strengthening. \n\nI agree completely that this has been a long hard road, but loking back I would do it again in a heartbeat.",

I had to start looking at how my actions were going to affect me physically 20 years down the road instead of a few weeks down the road as I had been doing before.\nYou almost feel like you are invincible at that young of an age.\n\nAlso best thing that I ever did for shoulder recovery was yoga.

I learned my limits and began weight lifting which has kept it in socket for years now, barely.  My sister however dislocates hers in her sleep on a regular basis and needs the surgery or it's going to destroy her later in life.",

During PT they noticed the shoulder issue an MRI showed it was 2/3 torn.\n\nAnyway, I had the surgery and it hurt like hell. I did PT and followed instructions. Spent a year off the ice and I don\u2019t remember any specific times I hurt it but it\u2019s hockey and falls happen. \n\nSo 18 months of no sleeping on that side and the shoulder actually feeling worse I went back and he sends me for another and guess what? I tore the last 1/3 and had to have another one. That\u2019s three years ago and I\u2019m so terrified of hurting it again I haven\u2019t played since. \n\n6-18 months and I would caution you that 6 months isn\u2019t enough. \n\nAnother thing, it doesn\u2019t feel great still to this day and only in the last year could I sleep on it. I have a very high pain threshold and this surgery fd my shit up. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anyone if I\u2019m being honest.",

Its dislocated and I am screaming for help (was 17) and I was so tired of it happening I just sat there crying until my Grandpa ran in and tried to force it back into the socket. It took a while.",

Some jack wagon botched 2 arthroscopic surgeries at which time my shoulder dislocated enough times that my should joint wore away so had to get bone bolted in there.  Scars been there for a few years now and it\u2019s stable so I wasn\u2019t afraid to get it drawn on and not just get cut up again.\n\nHow it happened: shoulder dislocated more times than I could count but originally it was from mma and lifting\n\nStory for the tattoo: I\u2019m not a commercial diver but I\u2019ve been diving since high school and I\u2019m currently working towards getting my master diver. All my other tattoos revolve around the sea or diving so this was the 1st thing that came to mind. Also do minor metal working on my spare time.\n\nWill the hair grow back: yes I got the tattoo a couple of weeks ago so the kelp is currently growing back. Thankfully it\u2019s not too thick in that spot so the diver shows up great\n\nSorry to the dude posing as my lawyer, that shit was hilarious\n\nThanks to all the positive feedback. You guys are awesome.",

Welding is one of the most dangerous jobs we do, but the most dangerous i would say is underwater cutting (oxy-arc)(cutting metal at 7000\u00b0C). When you are cutting metal underwater it will release a gass that can explode if ignited, and if you are not experienced enough with drainage of gas, it will gather in spaces and most likely explode. Most likely you will blow your eardrum out, but in worst case scenario you will be knocked out or even die by the explosion.",

This is also why this isn\u2019t a very popular style in the first place. Traditional tattoos have huge bold borders for a reason: they help mask the way the ink naturally spreads over time as well as ensuring that the overall shape of the design is visible even decades on when the tattoo has faded and spread. Subtle variations in color and shading will eventually become much less subtle. Even tattoos by legendary tattoers like Paul Booth suffer greatly over time because what makes them look amazing is exactly what doesn\u2019t hold up. I think this is a gorgeous design, and I don\u2019t mean to poo poo it, but for anyone reading this and considering getting a tattoo like this, please be aware that you may have to go in for touch ups every few years (which of course isn\u2019t the end of the world).",

I personally love every part of getting tattooed, from sitting in the chair to seeing it heal, so touch ups aren't a deal breaker for me. I can see how they aren't ideal for many people though! It all boils down to what level of upkeep you are comfortable with.",

Just because an artist makes beautiful work it doesn't mean that the normal lines of logic (when it comes to longevity of the original work) doesn't apply to them. By the same token, discussing how a piece might not have the longest lifespan isn't taking a poo poo on the tattoo either. It's a healthy discussion and I appreciate you explaining it to those who are wondering :)",

I think part of the reason why his tattoos all are on the light side is because that's just the style. For me, I went into it knowing it wouldn't have a super long lifespan without touch ups because the \"chinese silk painting\" look reminds me of my grandma's house and all the traditional silk art on her walls when I was a kid. That's all gone now but looking at my arm brings me a sense of nostalgic happiness. I have some tattoos with bolder lines that will last way longer and some that are daintier that will need more upkeep. I know it won't make economic sense to everyone, but for me, I'm happy. :)",

I do think the artist lightened this picture- in person, the larger bloom is more of a peachy orange and the darker parts are crimson red. I would guess that the gradients would fade to a light creamsicle color. I'm not too concerned about it because I really don't go into the sun much (like, ever, lol) and the thin outlines look like they could be pretty easily touched up by any artist.",

Lines can be the hardest part of a tattoo and someone could easily ruin it when trying to touch it up. Steady thin lines are difficult and I would take care with who is trusted with the upkeep of this piece. \nThat downside to a tattoo that needs a lot of upkeep lies in the fact that you don't have easy access to this particular artist with this skill set. You would need to find another one with a similar style and hope they can pull it off. I have a very aged Spider-Man tattoo that needs some retouching but it's been sitting idle for years because I don't have access to the original artist and I am scared to death of someone ruining it . I've seen plenty of good artists and even have my regular guy, but I've also seen this style butchered and I'm not trying to hate one of my favorite tattoos. I haven't come across anyone that has done this style in this way, just similar ways, and it's not worth the risk of not liking it anymore. So, I wait.",

They live 10 hours away so I\u2019d prefer to get a bunch done at once.\n\nI want the layout of different things to be nice at fit well together (and somehow remain feminine-ish) but I\u2019m kind of out of my depth in terms of what looks good. I know I can\u2019t take up the artists time with vague ideas via email.\n\nDo I need to come up with every single piece and basically design it in my head first, before approaching her? She has limited flash and it doesn't all speak to me.\n\n*For more context its just my forearm to start (the upper arm is occupied at the moment) And its actually bold line medieval pieces but the spirit is the same",

For me, it was a reminder of my fight back from a challenging period in life - my inner strength. Once you know that, look at the portfolios of different tattoo artists in your area and find a few whose style you like. Here in Montreal, Instagram was a good place to see the portfolios. I liked one in particular and then met with him in the shop. He got my \"why\" and we clicked. He also picked up that I have this fire in me - and suggested a color change to what I originally thought I wanted. (He was 100% correct.) We also changed where I thought I wanted it and how big. In the end, I am THRILLED with the result. Good luck!",

After the tattoo healed, it left scars in about every area of shading and the ink pretty much disappeared. All the line work is perfectly fine but in most areas of shading all that is left is a scar and no ink at all. I\u2019m not sure what could have caused this, my artist is a reliable and professional. I also have keratosis pilaris in the area that was tattooed so that might be the issue too. But I was just curious to see if anyone has ever seen something like this before and if it\u2019s possible to be tattooed over.",

With all respect to artists, they aren't trained in human biology, they are just repeating an old wives tale that was probably made up by some angry traditional artists who were upset by new styles becoming popular.\n\n&gt;My 10+ year traditional tattoos are all holding up well whereas my buddy with his outer space themed sleeve from a few years ago is unrecognizable from the time he got it.\n\nWhy would you assume the style is the cause of this?

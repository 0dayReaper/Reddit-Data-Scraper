If you allow a tattoo to heal and then hit the color again after it's healed it has the same effect as when you paint a wall and then apply a second coat after the base coat has dried. I also instruct my clients to moisturize their healing tattoo five times daily as well moisturized skin retains a healing tattoo much better then when the skin dries out. Other pro tips include drinking lots of fluids and taking zinc which expedites the healing process.",

If you have a good artist, you'll get good aftercare advice and follow-ups. \n\n\nAfter that, keep it out of the sun as much as possible.

But a quick and simple touch up 15 years down the line would make the tattoo look brand new again. The convenient thing about dotwork is that if it fades or blurs, the effect only softens, since you're creating an optical illusion with the shading in the first place. ",

She actually tried a rescue while pregnant with me and I was a toddler at the center.  After college, I took up diving and sea lions were regular dive buddies.  They'd swoop by doing shark impressions and nibble your fins.\n\nSo I see the combo as being what is quintessentially Californian to me.",

Many tattoo artists would simply trace that design and get started. I chose to start from scratch using an actual bear silhouette as reference. \n\nThe treeline is completely different as is the flock of birds and as are the bushes/dotwork details throughout the bears face and legs. It is all completely different, albeit surely similar. ",

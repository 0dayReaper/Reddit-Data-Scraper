I\u2019m asking if someone can put into words, eloquently, what they think this means.  I think it\u2019s an awesome tattoo, so much so that I am pondering how to incorporate into my collection.  Lots of people are commenting that they love the meaning of it, how would they describe the meaning as they see it?  It\u2019s a genuine question, not a smart ass rhetorical comment with a question mark on the end.  \nI wouldn\u2019t come on here to talk shit about what someone did to their body permanently.\n\nLike someone at an art gallery asking you \u201cwhat does this mean to you?\u201d.  Is that rude?",

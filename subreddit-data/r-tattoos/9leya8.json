After about halfway through Book 5 - Wolves of Calla it just goes off the rails. And not in a good way. I got the feeling King was trying to wrap it up because he was done being interested in it and felt it had gone on far too long. The shit in 6 and 7 just solidifies that in my mind. Don't be surprised if there's a point where you just stop reading and go \"What the fuck?\" and try to make sense of it. \n\nGreat series up until then. But the hodgepodge that's coming up almost ruins it. ",

I definitely felt like the story peaked at Wizard and Glass (probably one of my favorite books ever) but still had some later parts that were better than some early parts. I was a pretty big fan of book 7, enjoyed it more than Wastelands, but found Song of Susannah to be an absolute chore to get through despite being one of the shorter books. I like book 5 but felt strongly like it's overall arc echoed W&amp;G too much. The similar themes I think would have worked great for the story had they not been in back to back books.\n\nAs to your actual question: I think the first half is far and away the stronger end but am happy to have seen the story find an ending. Without giving anything away, I think anyone who has read the series would attest that there is no telling how much different the story would be had certain events not occurred in King's personal life.\n\nKing has made it abundantly clear that he had the entire story more or less fleshed out from the beginning but there are clearly things included in the finished product that weren't in his original vision. However, even with the second half of the story being the almost universally accepted as inferior, I think, all things considered, most people are (or should be) happy that he took the time to complete the journey. \n\nIf we were to take a poll as to whether or not people preferred to have George Martin release slightly inferior books to ASOIAF to finish out the story, or to pass away leaving the tale forever unfinished, I think the masses would much prefer the former.",

I booked a trip to Europe and contacted a few artists whose work I liked on Instagram and sent them the idea, I knew I wanted a tree like that but I was deciding between it coming out of a skull or off the shell of a turtle. It has meaning to me but I wouldn't have gotten it if I didn't like the design, the artist did an awesome job.  I'm 26 right now and it was pretty easy to go through for the most part, the pain was manageable but it did start hurting during the shoulder area and during shading. ",

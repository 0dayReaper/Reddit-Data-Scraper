This may be a bit too flippant so soon, but when my Dad died last year, my friend welcomed me to the Dead Dad's Club.  It was weirdly comforting.  So, welcome.  Nobody in the DDC (or anyone else for that matter) knows how you feel, but there's a common bond we all share.  It feels shitty.  At least for me, the fog of grief was unbelievably thick.  But it gets better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease be warned - over the next weeks and months, your grief will subside.  But it will be back.  It could be 6 months.  it could be a year.  But it will be a fuck of a fight.  Do whatever you can to prepare.  If that means seeing a psychologist, do it.  If that means starting a habit of nature walking/hiking, do it.  If it means working out shit with writing, do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHollow condolences and meaningless prayers, while nice to hear, don't do shit.  Lean on your support network as much as you need.  Friends and family want to help you, but 95% of the time don't know how.  This was my biggest flaw.  Asking for a good cry or a night of ignorance wasn't something I was built to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish you luck on your journey.  It will be tough.  It will be filled with laughter and tears.  Be selfish, because you're entitled to it.",

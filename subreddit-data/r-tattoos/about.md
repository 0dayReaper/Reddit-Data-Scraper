 (Make sure we can SEE the tattoo). NSFW flags for NSFW posts.

Be respectful: Stay civil, and keep the comments about the tattoo(s).

ANY comments made on personal appearance or user's body will lead to a ban, compliments OR insults. This includes comments like "Nice! Great tattoo also!"

No bickering, insulting, trolling, or other garbage behavior. Do not suggest ridicule subs or say a tattoo will age badly.

Do not use hate speech/slurs even if you think you mean it as a "joke."

**Constructive criticism is allowed, don't be an asshole or a creep.**

Tattoos must be by a professional artist and fully healed, tag NSFW: Do not post work that is not on your body or was not done by a professional tattoo artist. 

Post pictures once your tattoo is fully healed, no ink sac or visible blood.

Be sure to tag NSFW content even if it's censored.   

- NSFW is allowed, but the focus of the picture must be the tattoo(s)

All questions go in the Weekly Discussion thread: Post all questions in the pinned Weekly Discussion thread. This includes looking for artists in your area, pain discussion, tattoo placement, and cover-up ideas.

Questions for your tattoo artist: Any questions about whether a tattoo will "work" with scarring, skin tones, body type, body location, or how to add to your tattoo. Only a qualified artist will be able to answer your question, and discussion on Reddit will only lead to misinformation. *Ask your tattoo artist.*

No aftercare/medical questions: **[ANY discussion of medical advice or aftercare](https://www.reddit.com/r/tattoos/comments/3cth6c/reminder_about_medical_and_aftercare_advice_from/)**, including possible allergic reaction, infection, or if a tattoo is healing properly. If you have an issue with a tattoo, return to your artist or ask a medical professional.

No spam/promotion/shitposting: Artists are allowed to post their work, but promotion is not allowed. No social media names, no links, no sales.

When posting multiple tattoos from one artist, please add all the photos into one post.

No memes, advertising of any kind, contests, surveys, money-raising events, OnlyFans/porn, or social media spam. 

If reposting your own tattoo, you must wait at least two weeks in between posts, don't delete &amp; repost two days later because you didn't get comments.

No Non-Professionals / Scratchers: Tattoos performed outside a professional studio, prison tattoos, scratchers, bootleggers, kitchen magicians, etc. 

Equipment discussion of any kind, including ink or buying/selling anything.

 Tattooing "how to" advice

**This will lead to a ban.**

The tattoo artist did an amazing job and really followed the lines of my body. I hope I never run in to him again because I ruined, absolutely ruined, his beautiful work by gaining 50 lbs. No judgment for people who get this kind of tattoo, though, hopefully they have better discipline than I do, or get in to therapy sooner than I did (partially to address my horrible relationship with food).",

I feel like even if the tattoos are warped by stretched skin, you'd still be proud of them and they would serve as a visual reminder that your body is more than the skin. Having a kid is also a reminder that your body is more than skin.",

Whenever I get anxious I automatically start touching my bellybutton. 15 years ago I thought if I'd pierce it I would stop with it, because it would be weird to touch my bellybutton with this metal in it. It worked, but only for the first months. Now I just twist and touch both, and that's why it looks differently than usually seen placed.\n\nBut maybe you can still work it around with a piercer to place your a bit above than normal? I dunno, bellybutton shapes matter too here.",

I basically go with nature/organic/indigenous patterns that I love, and then I get a new tattoo whenever I start a new life cycle, or as I am done with an old cycle - that's the real symbolism to them. I tattoo them to remind me of what I no longer want in my life, and what I want to keep or have in the future. This belly one has that feathers-like line sort of symbolizing some kind of freedom achieved by closing that one cycle.",

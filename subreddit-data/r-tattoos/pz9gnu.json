My client came to the shop with some extensive 3rd degree burn scars around the entirety of his forearm that extended from his wrist to just above the elbow. He told me that several tattooers had turned him down prior to visiting my shop, as every artist that he had talked to told him that the scars were not able to absorb tattoo ink. I agreed to try but with the caveat that I wasn't sure how hard it would be to tattoo the scar tissue. To my surprise his skin took to tattooing extremely well and absorbed the ink with much less fuss than expected. The tattoo healed perfectly, too (this is a healed photo). Total application time was approximately 12 hours over 4 sessions.\nEdit: Thanks for the trophies and awards kind strangers!",

Whether he covers them up in the future or not, he needs to understand that 1. burns are a very common injury, it's not as weird as he probably feels it is and 2. the scars are just remnants of his skin doing what it was supposed to do, that is to heal. People often view scar tissue as skin somehow being defective when really it's the reason you're still alive if you ever broke it. Also, it's important for you as his parent to understand that while he probably can't remember the accident itself, it is fundamentally his story because it is his body. Let him decide how big a deal it really is. And help him feel ownership of his story, answer his questions about it and if he doesn't ask any, don't assume everything is fine and dandy. It's weird to have been born without a feature you can always remember having.  \n\nBearing scars, for me, is not a problem of me not liking my body, it's how other people respond to it. Grown ass people stare and that's really not on me. I hope your son will grow up to feel perfectly entitled to be himself in public and know that if anyone makes it uncomfortable they need to adapt, not him. With that kind of resilience he will be able to get a great tattoo and that will be all there is to it. Sorry about the wall of text",

My dad's boss would introduce me to people as the burned one, make me show my scar and proceed to tell people my story.  It was humiliating.  \n\nAs for burn camps they are game changers for kids.  When I was a kid, the local weatherman Dr. George would do a week long segment on burn camp on the news.  I always wanted to go but I lived on a ranch and my parents were farm workers and we were rather far from the city.  Years later ended up volunteering for the organization that did the camps.  Never did go to a camp but I got to ride in a fire truck with Dr. George during the burn relay one year.  That was awesome.  I have to add I'm very lucky.  I can hide my scar with a long sleeve shirt.  I did that everyday until I was 14 when one day I wanted to wear my shirt from KNAC my favorite radio station and it was short sleeved.  It was liberating to finally wear what I wanted. \n\nI'm used to people starring but it is annoying when I talk to people and they talk to my arm instead of looking me in the eyes.  On the flip side when I used to volunteer in fire prevention education it sure made the kids listen when I was trying to deliver a message.",

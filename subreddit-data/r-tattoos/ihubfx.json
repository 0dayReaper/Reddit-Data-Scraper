That last year we knew was going to be his last but I still wasn't prepared for the phone call that I needed to come down immediately because he was going straight to hospice and he would be gone any day. I didn't sleep that night (I got the call around 5pm) because I immediately left and drove the 17 hours down stopping 5 hours into my trip to get my mom. I didn't sleep until a few hours after I'd made it to the hospice center. \n\nAnyways, after he passed 2 weeks later I went back home. After 3 days I went back to work and left in the middle of my shift. I never went back. I had already had an anxiety disorder before this but then I fell into a deep depression. I couldn't work, I didn't leave my house and I just generally didn't want to be around anyone. I became an angry person . I got annoyed at the slightest things and just hated anyone near me because I wanted to be alone.\n\n I didn't lay in bed all day like some do with depression. Instead I kind of became obsessive with cleaning my house in an exact way. Then I'd discover a hobby like bullet journals, plants, cross stitch, crochet and would spend hundreds of dollars on supplies. I'd do the hobbies in between cleaning every day for maybe 2 weeks. Then I'd just stop. I'd still buy some supplies I liked but never picked up the hobby again (I do still care for my plants though) That kind of turned into a shopping addiction and the only time I'd leave my house is if I was shopping. And the trips to the store weren't ever for only 1 or 2 things. It was always at least $200 worth.\n\n Obviously, this took a toll on my health, finances and my relationships with friends and family and makes me feel like an awful wife and mother. My husband makes really good money but I'd put us in debt because of this and he'd pull us out again and again.  \n\nNow all of this just happened over the past 3.5 years. I just recently got help and am seeing improvements. I am still shopping but have definitely cut back a LOT. I have gone to 1 event where I was around people without having a panic attack and crying, running home. I still get annoyed at my family though and have to step aside and take a few moments to myself and realize they're not trying to annoy me, they love me and enjoy being around me. I've also started having my son (8) do chores and teaching him how to do it. It's taking me a bit to let it go if he doesn't do it perfect but he's a child. I know not letting him do things himself was harming his future and independence. \n\nI'm sorry for the long comment but if you read all of this my point is that you don't want to go through this like I did. It's going to be tough. Just reach out for help if you need it. Reach out to someone close to you that can help/understand or to a professional. I am so sorry for your loss and I hope time heals your heart.",

I've been saving and trying to find a good artist to get a memorial tattoo.\n\n I love yours and the fact that you got one like his.  I'm having a hard time figuring mine out exactly because he loved fishing and music. We bonded over music since I was little but I don't really care for fishing anymore, I used to with him when young. So I'm wanting something that incorporates fishing and music but is something I'd like myself while still honoring and respecting my dad.",

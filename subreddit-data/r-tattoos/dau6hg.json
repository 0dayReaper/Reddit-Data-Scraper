It's a japanese-style (urezumi) tiger with a pink panther sticker pasted over it. Tigers are a big staple of japanese tattooing. American tattoo artists of the early 1900's worked alongside and borrowed heavily from the japanese tattooers from around that time (i.e. Sailor Jerry, Ed Hardy.) As a result, big cats (i.e. tigers, panthers, leopards) are also a staple of the style artists from around that time established, American Traditional. The Pink Panther character is also a staple of American Traditional. Based on that I interpret this as homage/mashup to both American Traditional and Japanese Tattoo styles without directly mixing or including both styles. This tattoo is something you would usually see a traditional/ japanese artist do on canvas and it's really cool to see it interpretted on skin.",

For example, my back piece I got for local rates *here in Vietnam* was very expensive here but would be a steal back in the States. Artists in the States don't need, for example, me giving customers fuel to try and bitch down their prices. \"Well he got it for $x, you shouldn't be charging so much more, here!\"\n\nReddit is an international website and although I'll give the vast majority of people credit, the loud minority of jaggofs would still harass artists just to save a buck or two, regardless of what country their citing prices from.",

Really love his take on the tricep area - my vision was a sort of 'armor plating' design and wanted his take on it.\n\nObviously these designs were subject to change once work started on a real, physical arm. We made design choices together during sessions as we progressed. So there are some organic deviations made along the way.\n\nWe're both very happy with how it turned out!",

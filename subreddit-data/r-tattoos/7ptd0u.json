Individual pain tolerances, body build, current fitness (enough sleep, food and water), style of tattoos.  I got both my calves tattooed last month in 2 days. 8 hours per leg. First day I could take it, 2nd day I tapped out after 4 hours. Unbearable pain after 1 hour. Not enough sleep, food and water and I just couldn't do it anymore :) ",

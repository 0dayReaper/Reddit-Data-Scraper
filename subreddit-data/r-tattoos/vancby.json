Each angle made something look disproportionate but in person it looks how it should. \n\nMy client wanted a Plague Doctor because well let\u2019s face it, death and disease has been essentially at the forefront of our collective psyche for what feels like years now. So my goal was to create something that not only translated how I feel but also captures how HE feels. \n\nThe skeleton is grasping at life while already in the grave. It\u2019s like they never really had a chance. I think in a lot of ways that\u2019s how we view death in the west. We\u2019re constantly grasping in agony for this thing called life and no matter how hard we try we can never keep hold of it. It\u2019s an illusion of the senses. Our addiction to life and fear of death is more terrifying than death itself. When the western world is finally confronted with something they can\u2019t escape from well\u2026 this is what it looks like to me.",

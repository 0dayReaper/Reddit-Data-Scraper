People judge you for your tattoos like they do the way you dress and style your hair, when people look back at past hair and cloths they often think thier past taste was terrible but don't regret it.  Yes you don't have to wear these things now but a lot of people see tattoos as reminders of points in thier life, like showing a person pictures from your past.  People say you can't change a tattoo but honestly the cost of a cover up is not massive and laser removal compared to a well paying job would be cheap if it caused large issue.  Ultimately  a lot of people don't care what others think of them and this feeling only grows as you age. It's well know that old people literally give no fucks.  If a coverable tattoo like that is worth regretting by the time you are 40 you can at least look at it and think I'm living a great life.",

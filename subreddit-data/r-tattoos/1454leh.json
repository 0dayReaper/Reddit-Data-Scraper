Just tried it with an actual large wrench and it I just have to angle it out like the image and it looks like that. You know, like a model holding a pose with weird objects in their hand, as in the image. There may be the thumb tip showing but that\u2019s just nitpicking, it would even probably be up behind larger part of the wrench.",

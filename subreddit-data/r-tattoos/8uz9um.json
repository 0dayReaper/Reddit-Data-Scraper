Then it\u2019s much quicker to narrow down an artist. Good, bold wood cut boils down to smooth, consistant line weight. American traditional tattooers ( an abundance in the bay) can nail those solid lines. I would follow all of the serious traditional shops. Tattoo City, Idle Hand, Spider murphys, Blackheart etc. and check out the tattooers housed and traveling too them. Pay attention to the outline of the pieces you\u2019re looking at, ignore the subject matter and color/shading. \n\nIn addition, there is one hardcore artist invite only convention. Bayareaconventionofhearts. Worth it to meet a mass of not only the best in california, but world wide. ",

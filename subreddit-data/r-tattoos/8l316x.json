As you can see, it has bled quite a bit :( it doesn't look to me like you had a lot of ink bleeding, but you know your tattoo better, so was wondering if you had anything like that OP? Also, can anyone with a bit more insight explain why some people are prone to ink spreading out and others aren't? Also if this phenomenon has a name? The only thing I've found online is blowout but that doesn't really look like blowout - no grey shadow, just seems like the black ink has expanded a bit into surrounding areas... Thanks!",

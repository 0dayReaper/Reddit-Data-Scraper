            "comment": "Great idea. Moderate execution.  The line work is pretty good overall, but the proportions are off. The ear on the left side of her head looks detached as does the left arm because the line got drawn all the way across so it looks like \"a piece\" has been attached to her instead of a part of her. That could be easily fixed when you get it colored, have them go over part of the line to \"attach\" it back to her.  The eye proportions are off as well. As long as you like it, though, that's all that matters.",

            "comment": "It was tattooed by Alba from [Long Story Tattoo](https://www.longstory.tattoo/) in Prague, Czechia.\n\nShe's an incredibly sweet person and very professional. Her linework is excellent and she's focused on creating tattoos that age well. She's from Spain and primarily speaks in English with her clients, so I can definitely recommend this studio if you want a souvenir from your travels to Europe.\n\n.... \n\nThe artwork was created by [Mahdieh Farhadkiaei](https://instagram.com/mahdieh.farhadkiaei?utm_medium=copy_link), an illustrator from Iran.\n\nShe's been working on illustrating the whole deck which she's planning to release as actual playing cards. She also sells prints of her artwork.\n\n\"A traditional object like the deck of cards, whose iconography has remained almost unchanged over the centuries, becomes the tool to celebrate the overcoming of the obsolete concept of love.\"",

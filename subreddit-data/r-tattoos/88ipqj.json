Firstly make sure you have a lot of entertainment options: books, video games, downloaded tv shows on phone/tablet, the free movies most airlines offer in headrests. Second, an aisle seat is invaluable. Going to the bathroom never becomes a hassle of dealing with 2 sleeping dudes. I found Delta (which is shit so I imagine other airlines do too) gives *free booze* on international long hauls. Which can help with sleeping. Another note on sleeping: [these earbuds](https://smile.amazon.com/Panasonic-RP-HJE120-PPK-Stereo-Earphones-Black/dp/B003EM8008?sa-no-redirect=1) are amazing for flights. They have 3 sizes of silicone ear pads and are meant to be like ear plugs. I wear them even unplugged to dull our the engine and people noise.\n\nFor jet lag: change your meal times to match destination. The airlines often help with this. My flight left in the afternoon and 1.5hr before landing in Korea they served breakfast (it was ~6am there?). Food will help regulate your rhythm in a way sleep might fail to do. Good luck.",

You can even see it lines up with the angle of the light source as indicated by the shading.\n\nAs for the longish torso: one, if you're trying to evoke a lithe hare-like rabbit rather than a cute lil easter bunny, you're gonna want a longer torso. Two, elongation of the human form is an old artistic trope commonly used to signify supernatural beings. Elongating her form to convey a sense of otherwordliness is what allows us to look at it and conclude she's some kinda rabbit demon thing rather than a bedhead bimbo wearing playboy ears. With strict realistic proportions you'd lose that element of subtle wrongness, and with it most of the creep factor. \n\nSource: Used to draw shit like this all the time.",

It's not on the face, hands or neck so it's not like it couldn't be hidden if needed. And otherwise, really, it's not on his parent's body so... who cares? It's not like that vagina rose one or the dick swastika in terms of offensiveness, although I suppose people will  find a reason to get offended about anything these days.\n\nAlso, maybe his dad has a tattoo of a naked biker chick riding a a Harley.

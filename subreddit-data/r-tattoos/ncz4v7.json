He loved Halloween, and sat out every year by the candy bowl with me to hand out treats and receive pets in exchange.\n\nI've been waiting a little while for that \"perfect\" first tattoo. I knew that this was the best way to honour the cat that was such a huge part of my life growing up. It turned out so beautifully and it truly captured the beautiful soul he was!",

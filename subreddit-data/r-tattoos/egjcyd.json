A good artist should be able to pack the color in and saturate the skin. There's logically no reason the colors should fade anymore than a traditional color tattoo if properly taken care of. A lot of people parrot the same things over and over whenever they see a color tattoo with minimal black in it. I don't understand why people think the absence of black ink means things will just disappear. All ink fades over time. If you can find a quality artist, I wouldn't sweat it too much.",

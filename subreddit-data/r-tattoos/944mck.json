I always got that vibe and I don't know if it's still a thing since my last tattoo was over a decade ago, but I always hated that mentality because tattoos can just be pretty sometimes. I thought that mindset was very elitist. Obviously I have no idea if this floral arrangement means something to the tattooee, but I think it's a beautiful piece of art that would take my breath away to see in person.",

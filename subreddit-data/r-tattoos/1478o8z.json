This year I finally went and got my nail technician license.\n\n I never dared get a tattoo before because I feared I'd change my style/taste after a while and wouldn't like the tat anymore. But I have finally gotten to a point in life where I'm comfortable in my identity enough to immortalize all these things on my skin. Even if I end up not liking the style in the future it will be a time capsule of the things that have shaped me and brought me where I am today. I'm happy I did this for myself!",

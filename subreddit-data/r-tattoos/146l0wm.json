I lived in Moorhead (home of the Hjemkomst ship) for several years and we often brought our young children to see it. And I\u2019m a big fan of the MN Vikings. I wanted a tattoo that tied a little bit of my heritage, a little of my kids, and a little of myself while also being thematically appropriate for a woodcut style.\n\nI ended up in Raleigh for work and will be here for life. This is a great city.",

    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019m a new student at Griffith doing a dual degree of business and design. I was wondering if any students here can give me advice on what to expect in the first few days, as I am both excited about starting but also nervous about how it might go too. I have attended all the orientation meetings, just wanted to get some advice for fellow students before I start. Looking forward to this!",

            "comment": "First lecture/workshop of each subject is just the course coordinator outlining how the course will run, and is the most important of any week. READ YOUR COURSE PROFILES!\n\nFocus on the social aspects of uni, use uni as an extended networking event. Befriend your teachers, peers, and potential employers. Business school has some great internships starting 2nd year, make sure your grades are high enough for them (credit average minimum). Having social ties to uni is what will keep you there **when** things get rough, join clubs.\n\nThe biggest difference between high school and uni is that uni doesn't hold your hand for everything, check your uni email daily. You'll be given access to learning resources: including books, lectures, and teachers. Be given access to an assessment schedule. That's it.\n\nUni content isn't really any tougher than year 11 and 12 high school, however you also have to balance doing more adulting, like working part time and more chores.\n\nCramming for exams and last minute assignments does work, if you want to get passes, but is more stressful and bad for your health long term. Fruit and Vege box by the student union is free and can help save money if coffers are sparse. Market days at Nathan campus are on Thursday, highly recommend.",

Feel free to send me a DM and I'll point you in the right direction.\n\nIf you are on campus and you are people walking around with black shirts on that say student leaders, go up to them, introduce yourself and ask how you can plug into services.\n\nThe first few weeks have lots of workshops on how to do assessments, use the library etc etc.  Also join Business Plus.  This is the time for you to get into the rhymes of study, meet you people, and just soak it all in",

I\u2019m just a little worried since I saw from the uni website that enrollment for trimester 1 2022 starts November, thus without my username and password given I won\u2019t be able to access and enroll... Do I send an email to an admissions officer?\n\nSo yeah, I would appreciate it for any sort of advice :)",

First of all congrats on graduating \ud83d\ude42 Thank you for your reply, I\u2019ll contact them later this week regarding the matter :) Also if you don\u2019t mind, I just want to ask how does enrollment work? Like do I enroll for my classes only for trimester 1 or do I enroll in all my year 1 classes? Sorry I\u2019m literally a clueless freshie",

Generally, people refer to semesters, rather than trimesters, as most people don\u2019t enrol in summer semester. If you do enrol in summer semester, fees are treated a bit differently. but that\u2019s for Australian students, supported by government fee help. Not sure how the fees work for international students. Doing summer semester will get your degree done sooner, though you\u2019ll miss out on enjoying the great Australian weather because you\u2019ll be studying. My tip on enrolling is just follow the recommended courses according to your program requirements. Getting creative and doing alternative subjects that may not be relevant to your degree/program may result in wasted time.",

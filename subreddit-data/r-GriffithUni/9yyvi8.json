    "postText": "We are looking for Australian university students aged 18 to 25 to participate in a study about risky drinking and self-injury. All Australian university students aged 18 to 25 are eligible to participate and will go into the draw to win an iPad or 1 of 10 Coles/Myer gift cards.  \nParticipation will take around an hour to complete a series of questionnaires about your emotional experiences, how you regulate emotions, your relationships with your family and friends, your thoughts and beliefs and, drinking behaviours. If you have ever engaged in non-suicidal self-injury then you will be asked about that experience as well.  \nThis study has ethical approval from the Curtin University Human Research Ethics Committee and is being conducted by Jessica Dawkins, Danyelle Greene, Kate Tonta, and Ashley Slabbert as part of their PhDs at Curtin University, under the supervision of A/Prof Penelope Hasking, Dr Mark Boyes, and Dr Joel Howell.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding participation please contact us at [jessica.c.dawkins@postgrad.curtin.edu.au](mailto:jessica.c.dawkins@postgrad.curtin.edu.au) or via Facebook on the Non-Suicidal Self-Injury Research page.  \nTo be redirected to the study please click the link below\n\n[https://curtin.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_cAvcXrTrqBxtN9X](https://curtin.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cAvcXrTrqBxtN9X?fbclid=IwAR2RfJ84n0mk8GfrWbWoZpYBrANEwYL2WRACg7imauFoD3pDhladat7_FH4)",

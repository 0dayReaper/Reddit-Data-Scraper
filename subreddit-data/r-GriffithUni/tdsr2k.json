My. Gravatt is more of a traditional campus that has its main rival as UQ. Griffith Gold Coast is more of a modern learning campus like the University of the Sunshine Coast and largely based on the health infrastructure it supports also.\n\nAs a newer campus with less students you may find the teaching methods to be a little different in that you have better access to your course convenors due to the smaller campus size.",

    "postText": "Hello guys, I am doing research on the vandalism of e-scooters. As part of this research, I need to interview (online cus of covid) any Lime or Neuron e-scooter workers, which I believe some of you guys might do as a part time job. If you do, could you please reply below or DM me privately. Anyone from those companies are more than welcome! :)\n\nEDIT: I am offering $10 to the first person (must work at either of these companies) who approaches me through DM (WITH knowledge about vandalised scooters- those with stolen helmets or abandoned/displaced escooters)",

    "postText": "So I'm still not even sure what uni I will go to. So if possible, could you please assume I may not go to QUT, or keep answers generic where possible?\n\nMaybe advice on another uni that may be more suitable.\n\nAt 32 years of age, off tbe back of a long career in the Army, I'm physically broken and pretty defeated with life.\n\nI should have gone to uni when I was younger, now I have to do it while I'm older, because my body just cannot cope with a physical job for much longer. I need a knee replacement now, but they refuse to do it because I'm too young.\n\nNow, I'm looking to study Mechanical Engineering, it ticks off my personal ideals of:\n\n1) Useful\n2) Leverages my life experience (I could go into Military Engineering for a Defence Contractor, I was a heavy transport operator, I could go into trucks)\n3) Has advantages in my personal life (I love cars, I play with cars a lot, I'll be able to build my project cars better)\n4) Employment, I know *buckets* of places looking for a mechanical engineer with their [approved persons ticket](https://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/business-industry/Accreditations/Approved-Person-Scheme) which would be where I'd go immediately after getting the degree handed to me\n\nHowever, some queries:\n\n1) Do I need to study something else? I always see people saying \"I'm getting a Major in Engineering with a degree in [something else]\"\n\n2) I notice \"full time\" is like, 20-30 hours a week. Can I bump this up? I'm medically retired, on a Pension, I don't have anything else to do with my time. My bills will get paid. I was doing 60+ hour weeks in the Military. To me, that's \"full time\"...can I do 60+ hours a week to get the degree done quicker. 20-30 hours gets me to Wednesday lunchtime....what do I do the rest of the week?\n\n3) What's uni like with medical appointments? I have quite a few, I beat cancer twice and have regular checkups, I see a physio, I have psych appointments for scars from my service, so on and so forth. I have around 5 hours of appointments a fortnight.\n\n4) How structured is it? After a decade in the Army, I hate disorganisation. If I'm not 5 minutes early, I'm 5 minutes late.\n\n5) What's parking like on campus? I may get bored and go run a truck for the weekend's, if I'm planning a holiday, extra cash is always good. Would there be anywhere to park a prime mover on campus for a day if I get in at 5 or 6am on a Monday morning? I can generally fit it into a regular carpark if they're at the 2.5m standard.\n\n6) Backing off number 5, obviously if I get in at 5am, go straight to the uni, do uni all day, I wouldn't meet NHVR guides for rest, so obviously I'd need to do 12 hours in the sleeper. Would this be an issue? It'd be a bit silly to jump back in a truck after possibly 24h awake.\n\n7) I've noticed a lot of unis assume I'll be living at the Uni, now, when I was in the Army, for the first year you had to keep (and pay for) a room on base. If you chose not to live in that room, tough tits, you pay for it. Are done uni's like the Army in this aspect? Tough tits, you pay for a room.\n\n8) How involved is the Uni in building cool shit? I know Formula SAE is a thing in the USA, I'd be super keen to build really cool shit.\n\n9) Is there limits to building cool shit? Like, with my military experience, I have quite a number of ideas, just wondering if there's bounds like \"can't build weapons\" (obviously I'd go off and get appropriate licencing and such if I were to do such a thing), but is that frowned upon?\n\n10) Is there much hands on with engineering, like the manufacturing components and such? Or is it a more theoretical degree? Here's the theory, go out and learn the practice!",

            "comment": "2. I was told that each class would occupy you for roughly 10 hrs a week. You can choose how many classes you enrol into each trimester with 5 being the maximum, I think. 5 classes = 50hrs a week. Personally, I recommend sticking with the usual 4 classes and use any spare time you might have left to study harder and get better marks. Also, first year courses are usually the easiest, but things can get tough quickly. So be prepared to adjust your study load each trimester. You should also discuss this with your program director and get their advice.\n3. It is usually expected that you attend each class in person, but sometimes there might be lecture recordings etc. Attendance is not usually assessed but \u201cengagement\u201d can sometimes be part of the mark. If you are going to be absent regularly, you should discuss this with your tutor.\n5. There is a time table for lecturers and tutorials you can attend and there is an assessment schedule. That\u2019s the whole structure. It will be up to you to organise yourself and complete assessments on time.\n\n7. Nobody assumes you\u2019ll be living on campus. No such tradition in Australia. Campus accomodation is popular with international students, but most students live off campus.\n\nGood luck! I started my Bachelors when so was 30 and had a great experience.",

I recently retired from a major defence contractor. \n\nI can say that your experience as is would make you very desirable in the ILS space. You could very easily get a ground level job in either training or tech pubs and study towards your engineering degree at the same time. \n\nThe reason I say this is because of your stated desire to push yourself. In my experience a Bachelor's degree is basic groundwork and not particularly challenging, but yes it will open doors up the ladder. \n\nWhat the Uni states is that for each class, expect 10 hours of work. This is why 4 classes are considered full time. \n\nParking is easy, you only live on campus if you are interested in that sort of thing. It's not hard to schedule appointments around lectures and labs. \n\nLong story short, you already have desirable skills and experience, you are highly motivated, employers will pay for your studies while you get a foot in the door. \n\nBest of luck!",

            "comment": "Ok I'm back!\n\nFirst off, I started Uni for the first time at 35 and it was the best decision I made. Being older made a lot of things at Uni so much easier since I had the work experience already. Im currently in 3rd year and honestly most courses have been easy for me. Thats not to say I could just kick back and not do anything though. I typically put in around 60 hrs a week into my uni work because I want to be the best. Your goals may be different. FYI I study Industrial Design so I am familiar with the engineering school.\n\n1. You would be doing a Bachelor of engineering and major in mech eng. Basically you all share a common engineering first year and then I think year 2 onwards you pick a major (mech eng, civil, etc) and then some of your courses will be specific to your major.\n2. Typically its 10-15 hours per course, and with eng you need to do 4 courses a trimester. You can do 3 and still be considered full time but eng degree is structured in a way that you can basically only do 4 courses in tri 1 and 4 courses in tri 2, barely anything to pick in tri 3. You can't really study more to speed things up as there will often be prerequisites that will block you from doing them early. Your pretty much stuck with 8 courses a year over 4 years for eng.\n3. Griffith is extremely accommodating with personal issues, be they physical, medical, mental etc. Also keep in mind though that you will often be doing group work and so this can affect your team as well. Try to stick to assignment deadlines or communicate with your team and apply for extensions.\n4. There are set times for lectures, labs, tutorials, etc but the work is self managed. If you don't turn up for a class thats on you. I've been in labs and students turn up at 10am when class starts at 9am. The lecturer will often tell them too bad and they can't join  the class since there are chemicals being used and he cant stop the class. So just dont be that guy. At least its a good filter to see who you should'nt group with.\n5. If your parking a big truck near GC campus, no chance. \n6. You will really need to figure out your work and study commitments. You will likely have a pretty fragmented study schedule with eng. Probably over 4 days you might have 3 hours of class on mon, 2 hrs on tues, an online lecture on thurs, and then a full day on campus on the friday. But this will change each trimester with new courses.\n7. No need to live on campus, mostly for international or out of state students.\n8. With eng your first year will be mostly maths courses, 2nd year you will probably start building some things. I recommend the mech eng major since the you will be doing more robotics etc. There is also the griffith racing club GRC which builds and competes in races and are very active. Personally with my Industrial Design courses I do get to build more as my degree has more focus on design but Im building stuff like models, furniture, cardboard etc. There was a course I did last trimester that was shared with other eng students and we had to build a complicated robot. It was pretty intense!\n9. Building or designing killing things is generally frowned upon at uni and likely not allowed in assignments. Eg I do a lot of 3d modelling and they often put no gun/weapon designs unless its fantasy.\n10. It will probably lean more towards the theory but you will also see and experience a lot of practical examples. Tensile tests, coding and building robotics, conceptual designs etc.\n\nHope that answers some. There is an open day at GC campus, 14th august. I recommend you come along and talk to the teachers/mentors. I will be there and also be doing a talk for one of the eng design courses to share my experience of the course as a student.",

            "comment": "I can answer some.of your questions, but I didn't study mechanical engineering so can't answer those Qs.\n\nWith the degree title, they can vary a bit depending on the uni, just to make it confusing. It will be called something like a bachelor of mechanical engineering or maybe a bachelor of engineering majoring in mechanical. Just look they the website. \n\nIn terms of hours, if you're looking at the timetables and it's showing 20-30hrs contact time, this is not the extent of the actual workload for uni. There is a lot of work you will be doing in your own time like assignments, readings, studying for exams etc that aren't measured. I'd say if you want to do well with grades (a good GPA is favourable for employers and also gives you options if you end up wanting to do anything at postgraduate level.. I'd suggest not ruling anything out until you're in there) you will need to dedicate substantial time to study in your own time. Essentially how long is a piece of string?\n\nRe flexibility for appointments - this depends on how the courses are structured. In my undergrad pre covid, everytbing was in person at fixed times, however lectures were recorded so you could easily just do the recording if you couldn't make it in person. Lately they've been doing a ton of online content w pre recorded lectures and stuff that's great cos you can work it around your schedule. The only thing that's really fixed are tutorials/labs - smaller classes that are more practical, these are not recorded. You can probably get away with missing a couple if needed for certain appointments, but if you want to do well you need to show up.\n\nAlso keep in mind your timetable will change every trimester because your courses/classes change.\nRegarding structure - if you've been in the military and are used to having everything super structured and being given orders, then uni might be a bit of a culture shock. It's very unstructured imo (which I personally love), it's up to you to figure out how to do the work, like if you don't know something, ask about it... No one will hand hold you or check to see that you are understanding things. Attending consultations/office hours with tutors is key to making sure you're on the right track if you feel a bit lost.\nNo one cares or notices if you don't turn up to lectures/classes... It's on you. You're treated as being responsible for your own learning. The way I see it, uni is not just about teaching you the course content, It's also teaching you how to problem solve, face hurdles and figure out a way to overcome them, learn about how to teach yourself in ways that suit your style of learning.. There's a lot more you can get out of it than just learning mechanical engineering.\n\nI started out mature aged as well, and I can't tell you how mind boggling it was with a lot of the younger kids who struggled to even look up an article to read after being told the title and author etc... Like they had zero problem solving skills and struggled to even try with basic stuff.\nI think you'll probably have an easier time with this being mature aged and having seen the world.\nAlso the library has A LOT of support available for transitioning into the uni life. Like academic writing help, assignment checking, teaching you how to search for resources and literature etc. It's all there to help, you just gotta have the will to find and utilise it. \n\nAs long as you have motivation and drive and can find ways to figure it out, you'll be fine. \n\nRe parking - not sure which campus you're talking about, I can only speak for GC, and it's a nightmare, nothing on campus where you can park a truck. Maybe park on a street nearby on a bus route that drops you at the uni. This is the strategy I use often (pre tram days) coz you can't park within a cpl km of the uni. I'm talking GC campus. \n\nRe living there - this Isn't really as big a thing in Australia, there is some uni accommodation at the GC campus, the uni village, not sure about other campuses. I know back in the day it wasn't cheap (not sure how it now compares to insane rent prices in the general community) and you'd probably be stuck with a lot young school leaving aged peeps. FYI QLD is in a major accommodation/rental shortage crisis, so at this time it's not easy to find somewhere to live. \n\nHappy to answer any more questions you may have or clarify.",

Some don't allow you to pick up more than 8 or 10 in your first year (not 9-10 first year subjects).\n\n4 subjects a semester is fucking hard mate. Each subject may have up to 12 assignments! You only get 13 weeks, you times those 12 assignments by 4 subjects and that's fucking full on. It's highly unlikely but it's the top end of a hectic subject workload. Most subjects are 3-4 assignments, quizzes, final exams. So your looking at 12-15 assessable components throughout the semester. ON TOP OF your study, tutes, lectures and \"free-time\" (ie gym).\n\nWith engineering you also need to consider your grades. A competitive GPA/WAM might be needed for certain roles. Learning to write non military style (reference and structure) is going to be challenging. The first semester or year you might smash it and get distinctions, but then you get a pass unit and your GPA drops and you need to work harder to pick it up again. That fucking sucks. Or you might only pass first year so a low GPA then you need to work harder in 2nd and 3rd years to build it up. \n\n\n1. Don't live on campus, as exmil you'll hate it. It's not like the lines.\n2. It's a adult learning environment so you study when you like, but if you miss tutes or lectures then you miss the content. They don't care. \n3. You'll have good structure in place for learning, but remember it's about what you learn and how you apply it.\n4. Pick up volunteering in your field whilst studying, at the end it will be a huge difference- in both experiences and knowledge. \n5. Don't do more than 4 subjects a semester!\n6. Aim for at least high credits and distinctions in your units. \n7. Majors are the 8 subjects YOU CHOOSE as electives, your degree is a bachelor or engineering - major in xx. Pick a major you like NOT one that will give you a job. You'll enjoy it, you'll get better grades, it will help you get through the shit subjects. \n8. It's disorganised.  Be prepared. \n9. You can build things off site in your own time and own money. You can get grants and scholarships too. \n10. Uni is mostly theory, not practise. That's why there's a divide between those 2. You need to practise whilst you learn theory. Hence why you get a volunteer role or job in the field at the same time. \n11. Don't be worried if you feel stupid at first. \n12. Don't be worried you are mature aged at 32.\n13. Have fun and enjoy.\n\nWhy don't you go to adfa?",

My bad. \n\nEven J32 wouldn't work, as an ADFA requirement is J1 or J2 with Waiver.\n\nLooked into it before I was made J52",

You don\u2019t have to do T3 and some degrees don\u2019t even have courses in T3. \nIf you have courses available in T3 I think it can help lighten the course work since normally you would do 2 trimesters of 4 courses. Instead you could do 3 trimesters and do a 3/3/2 course split instead of 4/4. But it does really depend on the degree and there is not many options for T3. \n\nEach course is 10CP with the final major being 20CP. Full time study is 30CP+\n\nWhich design degree you plan to do? Bachelor of design? I\u2019m currently doing industrial design which shares many courses. Happy to help with more questions.",

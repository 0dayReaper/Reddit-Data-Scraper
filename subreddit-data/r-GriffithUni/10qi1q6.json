Studying at GU would mean placements are linked to QED as they would assess her capabilities in the classroom and ultimately issue her with her credentials for Qld. \n\nIf she is planning on teaching in Tasmania, she\u2019d probably be better of transferring to UTAS otherwise she\u2019d most likely need to return to Qld to do the placements. And at some point get her registration changed to Tasmania. \n\nAlso, is she able to complete the degree completely online? Does she have compulsory on campus classes or intensive schools? \n\nI\u2019d be getting her to speak with a program advisor to figure out best way forward.",

You raise very valid points about her credentials, one neither of us considered. But I feel as though teachers transfers between states quite often so hopefully we will be able to work that out.\n\nMy only hesitation with transferring to UTAS is her degree will be looked upon as much less favourably by interstate institutions and may limit opportunities in the future. Last I heard, UTAS was strongly considering moving to exclusively online course offerings - not sure how that would affect teaching degrees.\n\nI'm not certain on if she can do the degree completely online, I think our understanding is she can do 90% of it online - but would need to be physically present for placements.\n\nSpeaking with her program advisor would definitely be ideal, but she's only just been readmitted to GU and it was a fairly rigorous process so she doesn't want to rock the boat by now enquiring what will happen if she moves interstate.\n\nAppreciate your thoughts\n\nedit: I've just also sent an enquiry to the 'new students' email asking as a prospective education/teaching student who plans to move interstate during the degree",

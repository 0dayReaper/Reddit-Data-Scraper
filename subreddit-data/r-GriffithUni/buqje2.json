    "postText": "Hi! So I\u2019m thinking of applying here and I was wondering what the creative writing course/major is like, and do you think someone with english as their third language can keep up? :( Whats the situation like? Good profs? Bad profs? Hard courses? \n\nAnd what\u2019s orientation like? How much free time will I have between classes and days?? Gosh I\u2019m so excited but also really scared. \n\nWhat are the dorms like? I love my peace and quiet, so is it super noisy there? And I have a friend who lives nearby and we talk a lot about having him visit me, so would it be okay to have male guests in the female dorms? Is there like a curfew? God I\u2019d hate that so much. \n\nThanks!! Can\u2019t wait to be there",

I have very strict parents and if the dorms somehow tell them that I have male guests \ud83d\ude2c I\u2019m fucked. \n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of :( I don\u2019t like it when it\u2019s too noisy and I like my space. But I guess, if I get to meet people I\u2019ll endure it haha. \n\nSo your attendance or absence isn\u2019t recorded? Does it affect your grade?\n\nAnd aww thank you, I was a bit worried but people have been telling me that I\u2019ll do fine which is great!",

            "comment": "I'm unsure about literature courses. I do have a few friends that are doing it. If your english is already this good then I think you'll be fine. For study... I'd say depending on how well you understand the course content, you could do a decent amount (&lt; 10 hours per week per subject) and still pass, but your experience may vary. For whether the lecturers, tutorial instructors are hard, most of the time not really. I guess just asking for help at the end of each tutorial or lecture is completely fine, there's also dedicated times where you can discuss course related stuff with them. There's a few non-course specific support teams who can help with things like writing, referencing etc, they're usually in the library (N53 on Nathan Campus, M13 on Mt. Gravatt campus). \n\nOrientation for international students I've heard is good; guided tours of Brisbane and stuff.\n\nI can tell you that the on-campus dorms (specifically Nathan campus) can be pretty good if you like diversity. For peace and quiet, depends where you're going. Bellenden Ker is like dorms, where each level is pretty much rooms. Barakula, Kinaba, Girraween and Carnarvon are more like shared flats, where you have up to 6-7 people in a flat / apartment. From asking a friend who lives on campus &amp; has a boyfriend, there really isn't much of a curfew. Male guests are completely fine. \n\nFood options not so much. Many friends of mine who live on campus will go to Sunnybank (for the Asian supermarkets - mainly Yuen's, and the late night open hours for restaurants) and Garden City for food / groceries. Getting there from either Nathan or Mt Gravatt campuses doesn't take long on public transport, about 15-20 minutes (Nathan campus taking the 120 bus route to Garden City, 135 to Sunnybank).",

I have friends from my city who I\u2019d love to hang out with haha if he can\u2019t stay over I\u2019ll be terribly sad",

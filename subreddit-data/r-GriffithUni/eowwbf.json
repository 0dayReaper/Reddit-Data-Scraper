Do you want to be closer to your UQ friends, or closer to the beach? \n\nI studied for 5 1/2 years at Nathan doing two degrees and I enjoyed it. I graduated a while ago now, but I visit the campus on business occasionally still and like the feel of it. The surrounding suburbs are pretty low key, but you're not far from Sunnybank (shops and restaurants), Mount Gravatt (big shopping centre) and the city itself. \n\nGold Coast campus is a bit more spread out and I think most would say it feels bigger. Nathan is on top of a hill and is against a very forest-like backdrop. Gold Coast is a bit more suburban and a lot flatter. Both have their strengths and weaknesses, but I don't regret studying at Nathan.",

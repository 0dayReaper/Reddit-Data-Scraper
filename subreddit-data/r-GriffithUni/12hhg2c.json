I am currently studying a bachelor of biomed and due to graduate this year, losing interest though as I realised there are not many job prospects out there compared to there science degrees. Should I transfer to medical laboratory science? Can anyone comment on the situation? From the looks of it there isn't much cross over so I may end up staying for 3 more years if I transfer. Not sure what to do.",

It\u2019s much easier to get into a postgrad if you have an undergrad, even if it\u2019s totally unrelated and they are often shorter (2 years rather than 3). I did a masters in GIS despite my undergrad being Arts",

Especially if you take subjects that are common across the degrees.\n\nExample: Let's say it takes three years to do a Bachelor of Science in a University. University of Newcastle offers Master of Clinical Epidemiology in a year full time study and if you take the right electives you can even finish Master of Public Health by just doing an extra semester and still finish two masters degrees in half the time it takes to do the Bachelor of Science.\n\nYou'll find many universities are quite similar in the postgrad degrees because they cut away a lot of the subjects you do in undergrad and just assume you have the knowledge.",

See if they need an extra hand in the research labs.\n\n\nI know a really cool lab demonstrator who runs some of the Undergrad Biomed labs. He did his undergrad in Environmental Science. He completed his PhD and his thesis was on something to do with vaccines. \n\n\nSo it certainly can be done! Good luck!!",

I work in a pathology lab now (and I hate it) but if you were interested in pathology, specifically a med lab sci degree is ideal because its AIMS accredited so its a lot easier to find a job.  So depends what you wanna do career wise..",

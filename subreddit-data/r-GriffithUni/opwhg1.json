    "postText": "Hi all - I'm a provisional psych and phd researcher running a clinical trial of an online self-help program for obsessions (e.g. distressing thoughts about cleaning, ordering, evenness, harming someone) and compulsions (repetitive acts like washing, checking, counting, praying, mental rituals etc.). It's a 6-week program with 4 modules (done entirely online in your own time) that teaches skills to manage OCD, anxiety and stress, and we're testing its effectiveness.   \nIf you struggle with these types of things, you don't need a diagnosis to sign up. We hope the results can tell us whether we can use these programs for early interventions. You can see the study details on our website:\u00a0[http://www.brainpark.com/projects/participate-ocdselfhelp](http://www.brainpark.com/projects/participate-ocdselfhelp)  \nTake care everyone:)",

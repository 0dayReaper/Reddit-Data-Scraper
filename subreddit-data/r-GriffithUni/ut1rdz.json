            "comment": "Hello there, I was an exchange student back in 2011 and lived on the Griffith College campus for about 6 months. \nMy experience there is now kinda old but I absolutely loved being there. \n\nAccommodation-wise, I shared my flat with 3 other guys. We were 4 in the appartment and 2 in the bedrooms. The beds being reaaaaally close to each others, if you don't like your flatmate, life can be a nightmare (but mine turned out to be my best friend). I heard some people rented 1 bedroom by themselves.\n\nAlso, the WC/bathroom suuuucked: it was just some toilets, a curtain and a shower... On the same floor (if you take a shower the floor would get wet till the water is drained). In the appartment, you have a TV and everything you need to cook.\nThe campus itself is safe, with some CCTV and security personnel, and there's a nice but a bit expensive cafeteria.",

            "comment": "Hi, I moved to student accomodation at the GC after studying at Nathan too. It was not on campus but was very nearby. It was around $220-$235 a week (depending on your lease contract length) and included all bills and wifi.\n\nI shared with 2 other girls, each with our own bedroom and ensuite. I was lucky to get in with a friend, and got along with the other girl.\n\nOverall if you don't mind the noise of traffic or bins being emptied, it was great - clean, safe, convenient. The beach is about 15 mins away by tram. I definitely preferred living there over a potential hour long commute from Brisbane for every class. The only downside is that there's no free parking. I got fined for parking in the only place that wouldn't get me towed lol.",

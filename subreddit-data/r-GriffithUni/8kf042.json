Very hands on from the beginning and a great balance between clinical skills and theory. It's also well integrated with the Uni Hospital across the road for clinical placements etc.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by a good teaching course? As with all courses, you get out what you put in. If you put in the work it's a strong clinical foundation, but it's pretty fast paced and you'll be quickly left behind if you drag your feet. In terms of reputation, Griffith in general is pretty highly regarded globally.\n\nDisclaimer; I jumped to Biomed after the second year, so can't really speak for the final year of the course.",

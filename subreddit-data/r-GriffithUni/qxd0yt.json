When you leave the course before the academic date, it doesn't have any effect on your grade, when you leave it before the census date, it doesn't cost you anything. If you leave *after* the census date, then it just goes onto your HELP debt as any course would.",

At the end of the financial year, if your wages were not above the HECS threshold this money will be refunded.  \n\nIf they\u2019re not aware of your HECS debt, and you\u2019re above the HECS threshold, it will come out of your tax refund at the end of the year and you may owe an amount depending on how much of your taxable income you can deduct and what rates you\u2019re at. \n\nYou will owe the full amount of the course fees if you leave a course after the first census date.",

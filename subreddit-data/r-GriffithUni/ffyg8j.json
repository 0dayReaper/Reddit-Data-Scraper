I may be moving to Griffith (Nathan) to start my PhD in cancer research, I just wanted to ask if anyone else has had experience in the PhD field at Griffith and if so, if they would recommend it at Griffith. I was also looking at getting a private apartment/studio, are there any areas around Griffith I should be careful of? Thanks!",

Both suburbs were safe for me considering I'd stay at the 24/7 lab and go home between 2-5am sometimes. \n\nTake in my mind though I lived about 600-800m from uni so it was a long kinda short walk but I felt safe.",

If you're looking for places to live there's probably heaps pretty close to campus or at least a short bus ride away.\n\nPersonally, I live on campus. It's not too pricey and it's really convenient, but it's a bit of a blessing and a curse always being able to walk to the office on a couple of minutes day or night. Depending on when you start, you might be able to find a vacancy",

He even did eng math 2 the next trimester...\n\nHad another mate fail physics, and he still hasn't done it... but has since done 2nd and 3rd year subjects that require it. \n\nSo it's definitely not a 1 and done... though I have heard of a chap on his 4th attempt of a core subject. Apparently this is his last attempt before he gets the boot - but this one is 2nd hand info, so I dunno about its validity.",

Academic standing - If you fail the same course twice you will be on \u201cacademic standing\u201d which is like probation. If you keep your GPA above 3.5, you\u2019ll be okay. \n\n3. JRG low completion rate - if you fail 5/8 of your courses you will lose commonwealth supported funding. You won\u2019t get hecs help and you have to pay full fees to continue. If you get your pass rate above 5/8, your commonwealth support will be reinstated. \n\n4. Designated courses - if you fail one of these, you\u2019re excluded for a year and have to apply for readmission. Check your degree on programs and courses to see if it has any designated courses (they\u2019re fairly unusual, I\u2019d suspect that you\u2019d know if you were enrolled in one of these)",

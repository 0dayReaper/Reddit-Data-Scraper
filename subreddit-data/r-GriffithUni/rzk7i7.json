I'm wondering how competitive the program is and what grade is considered competitive? Also, how is the work load? Would really be helpful if you can pm me! \n\nThanks in advance :)",

Feel free to PM me about any questions you may have :) \n\nAs for competitiveness, it\u2019s quite hard to get in- I think the last I heard, you needed an ATAR of 99.75. This equates to about a 1560+ in SAT standards. The program is not competitive once you get in, honestly found high school a lot worse. You\u2019ll take about 5 classes a trimester, and it\u2019s not bad if you know how to manage your time. People are very friendly and professors will help you if you ask!",

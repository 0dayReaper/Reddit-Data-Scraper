Recently because of covid and the fact no one leaves their rooms, its been pretty shit. \n\nOn my first day there i was a freshie low key hoping to get hazed so i could try fit in. Nope. But if you get out of your room and drink a lot, you'll meet great people.",

I dont live there any more, so dont know if theyre still doing them. \n\nI think you limit your chance at gaining new experiences and meeting friends if you dont go out a bit. After uni you dont get much opportunity to meet people like you do while at uni. Get out there and meet people. You'll make friends and have a great time. \n\nIm not particularly shy, so im sure this might make it harder for you.",

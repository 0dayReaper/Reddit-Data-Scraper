    "postText": "Hey everybody! So I'm an Australian citizen who's about to finish his studies (high school) overseas, and next year I'll be heading to Griffith uni to study a bachelor degree, but I'm concerned about how will Griffith uni process my application and how will they equalize and convert my overseas high school qualification grades to ATAR or OP, does anyone know the procedure or what strategy does Griffith uni use in this situation?",

            "comment": "You'll be assessed as an international student by the admissions office if your secondary education took place overseas. ATAR and OP only applies to students whom graduated from Australian secondary programs.\n\nDepending on where you went to school, the way of assessment will be different. For systems that are more closely aligned with Australia like, Canada for example, it's quite a straightforward process, but for other countries it can be a bit more complicated.\n\nYou can see a list of the entry requirements by country here:  [https://policies.griffith.edu.au/pdf/Academic%20Entry%20Requirements%20by%20Country.pdf](https://policies.griffith.edu.au/pdf/Academic%20Entry%20Requirements%20by%20Country.pdf)\n\nFor other information you can look at this page:\n\n [https://www.griffith.edu.au/apply/international/understanding-entry-requirements](https://www.griffith.edu.au/apply/international/understanding-entry-requirements)",

I know she will meet the requirements as shown in the links above, I\u2019m just curious as to how they convert the percentage grade. Would a 90 average still be a 90 average in Australia?",

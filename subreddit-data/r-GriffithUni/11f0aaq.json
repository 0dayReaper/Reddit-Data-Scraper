    "postText": "Hi guys, currently studying second trimester of first year bachelor of science majoring in data science. All the classes for the data science major over the three years add up to 120 credit points but my dashboard says I need 240 to get my degree. Does this mean I have to make up the other 120 points with other classes outside my major?",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm an American student possibly going to study abroad here and I'm trying to collect more information as I wait for my program application to be approved. I'm planning on living in the dorms was wondering how Australian students eat at college. In my college, George Mason University, we have multiple dining halls and restaurants on the campus. I tried looking everywhere on the Griffith website for anything I would consider something like a meal plan but I've\u00a0found nothing. How do you",

Each room is self contained in that it has its own stove top, microwave, and oven. There is a larger kitchen that is operated by the staff and they do breakfast or dinner every now and then but it\u2019s sort of outside in the communal area. Sorry I couldn\u2019t be of anymore help.",

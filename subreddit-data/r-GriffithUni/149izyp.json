    "postText": "I\u2019m an international student coming to study abroad at GC campus for trimester 2 and I enrolled in 30CP. One of them (tutorial) ends 10 mins before the next one (sem)\u2014the tut is in G11 and the seminar is in G39. Is there etiquette about leaving classes like 5 mins early to get to the next one on time? I was hoping it would be possible to give myself a little more time in the beginning to figure out where I am going without being late/interrupting lessons. \nAlso are there any breaks incorporated into the almost 2 hr classes or do they tend to just go straight through? Thanks for your help!",

And that\u2019s WITH having topography on my side having to go to the bottom of the campus when I arrive and the top to leave.",

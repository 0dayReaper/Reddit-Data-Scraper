    "postText": "Hi All,\n\nI'm a developer currently on stand down. I'm currently conducting user research on an idea which aims to help students navigate the first steps on their career journey. It's a service that I would've loved to have during my time at Uni.\n\nI've made a survey which should take you 5-10 minutes to complete. To show my appreciation for your time, there are 2x$50 prizes which i will draw this Sunday night (7/6) on Facebook Live using a random number generator (so you know i wont just rig the prize). Full details are at the end of the survey :)\n\nThanks, i really appreciate it! Survey: https://forms.gle/basbnhraWQq5VjyV9\n\nPS Have about 40 entries so far so a pretty good chance of winning the draw! Tonight @ 8PM AEST",

    "postText": "Finishing up my BA after a few years off travelling South America and Nepal and SEA but wanting to do law to get my career on track and become a lawyer so thinking of a Go8 like UQ after Griffith its quite good for me to get into and will be a good way to do law and the choices! Universities, like service stations and McDonald\u2019s franchises, are just property plays. Their boards are now crammed with investment bankers and entrepreneurs, who are best placed to recognise where the real uplift in value comes from, and have focused their strategies accordingly. Vice-chancellors and registrars love it \u2013 who wants to be an educator when you can be a property developer. Those paychecks and salary packaged premium cars have gone Boom ! and the Treasury department boffins can pat themselves on the back for a job well done. Lower real funding of universities has to be paid for by someone, why shouldn\u2019t we soak the literally endless queue of gormless 1ndians and Chiineese looking to insulate themselves in cultural ghettos like now ?\n\nUniversities are now run by the banks. The chancellor of U/N.S.W (the worst offender of all) is also the chairman of A/N.Z bank who has Harry T as its biggest client. Pretty prestigious and that is what Go8 is all about right?\n\nSo which one should I go to? Even those who were confident 3 months ago there were no problems are looking over their shoulders.\nMoney is tight - 4 local shops closed when l was away for three weeks recently. One of them was a $2 shop for dogs sake.\nEveryone l know is budgeting, \u2018that\u2019s too expensive\u2019, often for the first time in their adult lives.\nWe know a few real estate people through family connections, and house sales and prices are falling off a cliff( and this includes supposedly booming Hobart l might add).\n\nSo the law degree can help me buy a house and it is important to pick a good reputable uni that keeps its doors intact and degree reputation valuable for the whole world.",

While most law school respect, even encourage, some cynicism, I fear you\u2019ve gone too far with it.  I still don\u2019t think you need to be banned, but you may want to consider at least some of the more positive aspects to counterbalance with the negative ones (everything has both good and bad sides to it).",

It's more flexible than the bachelor degree (You choose your own research project and courses to take) and less soul destroying as a PhD since it's shorter and generally less pressure from supervisors\n\nI'd say if you're enjoying IT and can spend an extra year it's definitely worth doing. I assume it helps with job search too but I went straight to PhD so can't vouch for that.\n\nTry to pick a supervisor that is more flexible though. There's a lot of professors that micromanage heavily and will ruin the experience. Feel free to dm me if you have more questions",

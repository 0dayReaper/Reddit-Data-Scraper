    "postText": "Post for friend:\n\nLooking for the best option. Student's 3rd semester but 1st semester in the particular course. Student is taking 3 subjects this semester. One subject requires 60% of final exam to pass, student believes they can achieve this. Student cannot pass other 2 subjects, mostly due to compulsory classes and assessment not being completed. Both withdrawal without financial and academic penalty have passed. \n\nObviously they want to proceed with the path that means they have the least amount of damage to their GPA, time and wallet. Any advice is much appreciated.\n\nThank-you. \n\n ",

Graduated with a shit GPA and still got a job first year out of the degree. \n\nJust buckle down for the rest of the year. I didn't even put my GPA on my resume. Only person I have ever seen do it was my mate who went to Bond for law and he got some job in surfers.",

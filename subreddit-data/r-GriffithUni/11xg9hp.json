    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m a student from Singapore and I\u2019m thinking of going to Griffith uni for the Bach of environmental science. I\u2019ll have to go through the 8 months foundation programme at the college first. I chose Griffith because I saw how it was in a good price range and the rank isn\u2019t like one of the top schools but not that bad. The area and campus also looks really nice. \n   I\u2019m hoping to get answers on whether it\u2019s a good school for environmental science? How are the classes and would it be easy to find a good job? I\u2019m also considering the university of Western Australia in Perth. Although it has good prestige in terms of being part of the group of 8, it is significantly more expensive. If I can settle for a cheaper university like Griffith and still get the same outcome in the future I would rather choose that.",

First year placement was only two weeks and it was pretty good. Mainly just helping the nursing assistants and taking blood pressures/BGLs for the RN onsite. They told us not to work during placement, and it\u2019s a total of 80 hours for the two weeks so I don\u2019t know how anyone would have time to work anyway lol. Placement has definitely made me more confident with my skills but it\u2019s still very stressful because you get marked on how well you do during placement.",

They SHOULD either enroll you or tell you how to enroll.\n\nIf you are a current student include your S number, otherwise just contact details.",

Credit for helping me get to this point goes to Alex",

Class codes denote \u201cyear\u201d as the first digit, (i.e. 1xxx = first year, 2xxx = second year, 3xxx = third year)\n\nAlso, ask yourself: What do you want to do with your degree? Specialise? Experience a variety of aspects related to your field?",

It's always a stressful time enrolling every tri before things fill up. 30 credit points per tri is considered full time, anything less is part time. You can also do electives that are not part of ur main courses if there is not much available (It's frustrating ik, there is like never enough good subjects to do) and it still goes towards ur overall credit points.\nI'm going into my 4th year next year doing only elective subjects, because I did all my main courses first. If I would have done 80 credit points a year I could have graduated in 3 years, oh well. \ud83d\ude05",

Meaning I've only done 2 trimesters a year. People only really do tri 3 if they really want to or have to catch up on something before the next year. (So in my case I could have done 40 credit points over 2 tris a year and be graduated by now. But I only really did 30 a tri so now I'm just playing catch up using electives to make up those last few points that a lot of people did earlier.) But it really is up to you how you spread your time, it's your degree after all.\nAlso on another note if you don't know already there is an academic calendar that you can download or get one on o-week. But it's really helpful to show when the trimesters are, when enrolment opens, exam weeks etc.\nIt's also quite helpful ive found when your first starting to have a screenshot of ur weekly timetable and a map of the uni to help you find your classes.",

    "postText": "Hi All,\n\nSorry for gatecrashing from UniMelb - but I thought this post was relevant to share here, given the work issues at Griffith Uni as well. I'm running a survey on young people's experience of work and pay. If you're interested and have time, the details are below :)\n\n*Melbourne School of Government is interested in young people's (18-30) experiences of work and pay. The National Young Workers Survey will provide much-needed data on the pay issues young people experience at work. By completing this 15-20min survey, you'll provide valuable data to help inform policy, digital tools, and other support services for young people experiencing issues at work. Access the survey at this link:* [*https://government.unimelb.edu.au/news-and-events/news/national-young-workers-survey/*](https://government.unimelb.edu.au/news-and-events/news/national-young-workers-survey/)",

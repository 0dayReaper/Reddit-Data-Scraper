Honestly, I have no idea, but I drive to and from the GC semi regularly and an hour is about the time it takes, but if you hit traffic I'd assume you'll be late.\n\nWhile I do agree you'll do better by going to all your classes, you'll not do awfully but just doing lecture capture. I wouldn't stress about it too much. If you get there on time brilliant, if you don't then go in late and capture the bit you missed.\n\nI normally go to lectures and just listen, then do notes later by listing back to the capture.",

Surely it needs to be earlier.\n3pm that same day I have a class back at gc and the bus leaves Brisbane at 2:30.\n\nIt's a \"workshop\" class so I assume they will want some interaction from me.\n\nAnyone want to car pool Tuesday mornings?\n\n",

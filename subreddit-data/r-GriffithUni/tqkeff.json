If you want to, start with one subject for your first trimester to build into a routine with family and work without the pressure of additional study.\nC. Buy a wall calendar and write all your dates for census, assessment dates, appts, family events, school holidays so you can see the big picture and plan your time.\nD. Have a set study time every day and stick to it, either wake up earlier or stay up later.\nE. Cancel, uninstall or pause your \"time wasters\" subscription like YouTube, SM, Gaming apps.\nF. Know your \"why\", write it down, create a vision board with your why and pictures, dreams and goals and hang out beside your calendar.\n\nGood luck",

Maybe they won't be any help, but maybe they will, and it's better to know for sure.   \n\n\n**Mature Age Stuff**  \nTo start, throw an email to [outreach@griffith.edu.au](mailto:outreach@griffith.edu.au) and ask to be put in contact with / be thrown all the resources for the Mature Student team. In the email, you should also take the time to jot down some key dot-points and concerns, just in case they can better tailor a response for you.   \n\n\nAlso get connected to Griffith Events and look out for \"Mature Student Open Evenings\" -- events like this that have already happened, but I'm guessing they will again: [https://www.facebook.com/events/508871923091472/508871933091471/](https://www.facebook.com/events/508871923091472/508871933091471/)  \n\n\nOn the Griffith News website, they have recent articles about some Mature Student grads/success, so possibly in those articles somewhere might be information about resources and approaches that helped them? [https://news.griffith.edu.au/topics/mature-age-student/](https://news.griffith.edu.au/topics/mature-age-student/)   \n\n\nFinally, I don't know whether this happens anymore, but there definitely used to be specific Mature Student meet-ups during O-Week activities for your school (Science / Engineering), offering a chance to make some great inter-degree and cross-degree connections / mates.   \n\n\n**Study Stuff** \n\nThe biggest thing you can do is be consistent in attending lectures and tutorials and keep in contact with your tutors and lecturers.   \n\n\nWhat I found to be pretty helpful were the PASS sessions on campus. The school of Science has their schedule here: [https://www.griffith.edu.au/students/peer-assisted-study-sessions/griffith-sciences](https://www.griffith.edu.au/students/peer-assisted-study-sessions/griffith-sciences)   \n\n\nIf you use O-Week to schedule out a typical week, attend O-Week stuff, ask for points of contact from tutors, lecturers, librarians etc, and email away any questions or queries now, you'll definitely be giving yourself the best possible chance. \n\nI hope it goes really well!",

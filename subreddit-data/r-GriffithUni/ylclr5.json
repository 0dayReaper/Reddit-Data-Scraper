    "postText": "Hey everyone! \n\nSo I kinda failed my final exam by just 2% rip and I\u2019m just wondering, are supplementary exams more difficult than the actual exams? \n\nKinda worried since the supplementary exams will be my last chance to pass this course. I have been getting a High distinction so far in this course except the final exam (was not really feeling well while undertaking the exam), kinda sucks how this supplementary exam would drag my overall grade down to a 4 :( \n\nBut yeah would just like to know if anyone has had any experience with taking supplementary exams before.\n\nAlso this might be a dumb question but is getting a 4 still mean that u get credited for that course or is it simply a pass with no credits?? I\u2019m freaking out right now...",

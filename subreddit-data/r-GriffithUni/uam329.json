            "comment": "Yeh, absolutely possible to work part time and still have a social life in year 1. You only have about 10-15 actual contact hours on campus (workshops/ tuts/ etc), and the rest is lectures which can be watched at any time. The amount you\u2019ll need to study depends a lot on your undergrad degree, so YMMV, but the first ~6 months of first year is basically a biomed degree recap. That\u2019s different to UQ who go pretty much straight into harder content. \n\n\nYear 2 study load increases a fair bit but I still had time to see my friends and do a bit of work too. A lot of people do tutoring. Year 3 and 4 have much less free time. Very few people keep working outside of uni if they can help it, but I know a few people who did keep working so it is possible. I see my friends quite a bit less, but you can fit stuff in if you really try to make it happen. \n\n\nOverall comparing my experience to people I know at UQ, Griffith does sound more chill. That\u2019s not necessarily the vibe that everyone wants, but I\u2019ve loved it.",

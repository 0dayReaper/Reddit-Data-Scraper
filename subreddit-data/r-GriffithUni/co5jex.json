    "postText": "Hello! I am a 20 years male from Argentina, and my University has offered multiple opportunities for students to study abroad for a semester or two. One of the options was this Uni and I have to say I'm quite interested, as I'm looking for cultural and scientific enrichment, and a possibilty to experience living abroad aswell. My current course of studies is Chemical Sciences (or Chemistry), as I said before, this was one of the multiple Institutions I was offered, based on what I'm studying. My questions are mainly about accomodation (fees, availabilty and living in the campus), if I need student visas or other kinds of documentation, and academical guidance as a whole. About the school fees, I was told by my uni that if I apply, the payment will go towards my school and keep paying the same amount. \n\nAny help will be greatly appreciated. Please feel free to DM me if you wish.\n\nHave a good day!",

If you're in the dorms, they have events in the week leading up but otherwise, O-week is just pretty good in itself!\n\nEdit: If you're in a student accomm elsewhere, there might be events and stuff to introduce everyone at the beginning of the year and there could be some people from Griffith where you're staying even",

Does anyone have any advice or experience with the comp sci degree at Griffith? Any advice or thoughts about Griffith in general? Thanks a lot!!",

            "comment": "I can't comment on Griffith but I'm a Computer Science student at Deakin (second year) and looking at transferring (averaging a low Distinction). I would generally say the course is high quality. Its pro and its con is that it has a system called OnTrack for most Computer Science/IT units in which you submit tasks pertaining to a certain grade, you have to pass all P tasks to pass the unit, with additional C, D, HD tasks depending on which grade you want (with HD requiring all tasks passed). It's incredibly time consuming and tedious at times, although if you have the time, you can learn a lot and don't have to stress about very large assignments or exams. I unfortunately became less creative and engaged through the OnTrack system. It killed my creative thinking by having to submit so many tasks which draw from too many different text books/work book/lectures to a point where it's hard to actually tie the information together holistically.   \n\n\nI personally found it quite overwhelming and spent more time just trying to do tasks than learn the material and engage with classes. I am also a mature age student and parent, and a lot of the lectures/practicals are in the evening. Some units have recorded lectures which explain things quite well but they get quite tedious when you have too many units with prerecorded lectures. For me this was a bit of a down side as I would prefer lectures during the day so I can spend the evenings with my family and actually engage with teaching staff/peers. There is a large emphasis on C#/.NET when it comes to the second year OOP/Algorithm units (which is great), whereas the third year core courses are Python/C++ oriented and a mix of different computer science concepts, I heard Advanced Algorithms is good but the Distributed course is a mix of random things and somewhat disliked). I would also say their minors and majors are quite strong, the minor in full stack development teaches both Vue and React for Front-End for instance, but again, it overloads you with information. Whereas they have a very strong Data Science major. The only down side is that in my opinion it doesn't dive deep enough into statistical theory. It's more applied-ML oriented I believe.  \n\n\nAnyhow, don't let my personal experience affect your view of Deakin, I actually think they're quite good. I enjoyed most units, although I was quite disappointment with how messy some OnTrack units were where they would add tasks as we were going whilst they were revamping the course to a higher standard, this threw my planning off a lot and made me drop courses. I found their revamped Data Structures and Algorithms course this trimester incredibly challenging (and high quality), although some students blazed through it with no problem. Another thing worth mentioning is that some of the more difficult second year courses (OOP/Algorithms) have interviews/video requirements per task. This can also be quite time consuming having to either prepare for interviews explaining your solutions with your personal OnTrack assessor, or making videos explaining time/space complexities (efficiency of Data Structures/Algorithms), and sometimes both. Then again, this experience will help with interviews down the track. If you do choose Deakin, my advice is to always stay way ahead on task deadlines, which can be challenging as tasks don't always line up with when the relevant information is taught in the weekly lectures/released learning material/videos. Lastly, I transferred from UniSQ (USQ) to Deakin two years ago and I must say, although Deakin's standard is at a higher level in some courses, UniSQ was much better engagement wise and how they present their information, I actually had time and interest to do extracurricular research. I preferred their system, to which I think Griffith is closer to.   \n\n\nAnyway, sorry for the long post. Hope my experience helps you make a more informed decision and good luck!   \n\n\nTl;dr: if you have time and/or strong self-directed work ethics, Deakin can be great and smooth sailing. I personally burnt out with Deakin's Online CS/IT system.",

I don\u2019t really mind my grades and stuff I just want to pass. Staying ahead on task deadlines might be a bit hard for me because I\u2019m studying something else but it\u2019s fine I\u2019ll try my best. Once again thank you, I really appreciate it and if I see you I\u2019ll buy u lunch one day.",

                            "comment": "No problem at all! I think for most units passing is actually quite easy, Credits tend to have some large project you work incrementally on until the end of the unit such as making a game with Splash Kit (functional C++) or some back-end logic for a bank app (Object-Oriented development). Distinctions are usually algorithmic/logic heavy where you need to understand the actual concepts to apply them yourself intuitively. High Distinctions tend to be more about research and helping your peers, although some units use one distinction task to help your peers or create something of teaching value (video/poster/summary/tasks, etc). It honestly comes down to how productive you can be, you need to have an eye for detail but not linger too long on the same task as it affects your other units. I made the mistake of asking for help too late and stubbornly figuring it out on my own. This can be time consuming.   \n\n\nYou also may run into problems during your placement if you have no projects and low grades to show. But I'm not sure about that one because I haven't applied for the mandatory placement/internship/project yet so I'm not speaking from experience. If you're only going for pass marks, I would definitely spend some time on projects and store them on GitHub, pick a major/minor you're interested in and apply for a placement/internship in that area. You can then show your projects in the application and you have something to talk about.  \n\n\nFeel free to ask my any questions honestly!",

                    "comment": "I agree with u/Jazzlike-Translator2  except that I would never recommend going to Deakin.\n\nI actually quit Deakin's Comp Sci degree after one trimester because my experience was so bad, and I'm now tossing up between Griffith and UNE. The OnTrack system is exactly how u/Jazzlike-Translator2  described, but some professors take it to absurd levels. To get a HD in one unit (SIT102: Introduction to Programming) requires no less than 34 assignments. Some of these are small (describe what these code snippets do) some are large (teach yourself about recursion and Big-O notation, research three sorting algorithms, write an essay about them, implement one, and record a video of it working - that's all one assignment, out of 34.).\n\nThere's also Deakin's constant attempts to screw free labour out of you. One of your assignments will be ...marking your assignments. Those 33 assignments you submitted over the 12-week trimester are only marked pass/fail with minimal feedback. For assignment 34, it's up to you to go over them justify why they're worth a HD or D etc. If they agree, you get the mark, if they don't, you don't, but they've basically pushed a big chunk of the work of marking on to you.\n\nAs u/Jazzlike-Translator2  touched on, HDs can also be paywalled behind other free labour activities like producing teaching materials (which they will actually use in later trimesters if they want), \"volunteering\" as an unpaid tutor (sorry, HelpHub Mentor - enjoy staying at least one week ahead on 34 assignmentsso you can help other people with theirs).\n\nThe idea of paying $25k+ for this kind of treatment is obscene and I would advise you to stay well away.",

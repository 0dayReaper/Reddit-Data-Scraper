    "postText": "I am commencing a double degree for a Bachelor of Science/Bachelor of Information Technology this year. When enrolling in courses for Trimester 1, it says that I will need to complete 70CP for the Bachelor of Science (I guess that's for the first year). Since I am doing a double degree, would this mean that I need to do roughly half of the Level 1 Science courses, and the rest in the next year and vice versa with the IT courses?",

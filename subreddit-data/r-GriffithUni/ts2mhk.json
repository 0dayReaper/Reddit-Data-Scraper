However, I'm taking a lot of difficult courses and I would like one of my courses to be a cruising course. AKA I want it to be one of the easiest courses that the Gold Coast campus provides. Does anyone have any experience at the campus and which courses might be the easiest?",

In fact I\u2019ve seen science majors come into liberal arts classes and shit bricks at being told they have to read hundreds of pages (law for example although it\u2019s not done under Arts at Griffith) requires sometimes reading the extent of a small novel every week. Same for political science, international relations and history for that matter.\n\nUnless your talking foundations that is but then foundations in law isn\u2019t really law at all but more law history.although, no Arts are easy unless you\u2019re talking about creative writing or graphic design or journalism if that\u2019s your thing. Other forms of more \u201cscientific Arts\u201d revolve around deciphering bullshit from facts and what out of hundreds of pages of reading out of the obscurity of the facts do you have to commit to memory.\n\nNB: go read Foucault or Derrida from the technical French they spoke and translate it into common sense English and tell me that\u2019s easy. In fact even when translated into English the concepts are so arcane and rarely used as no one talks in such a philosophical sense about metaphysics that it will do most peoples heads in in less than a week.\n\nI really want to meet some of these people that say Arts is easy one day to see if they\u2019re actually just trolls or whether they\u2019re just \u201ccat herders\u201d who have never set foot in a serious discussion in their life.",

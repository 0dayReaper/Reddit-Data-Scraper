    "postText": "So I'm in my week 12 now of trimester 1, year three of my bachelor of fine arts. I am aware the uni is changing the name of the bachelor soon enough too. I had my concerns when enrolling to classes for this trimester since there's been some miscommunication beforehand about some classes and their limits. I was hoping to have taken a class along with my studio classmates, which was apparently a cornerstone. However I didn't learn that I was meant to take this class to graduate until after the enrolment dates. I tried getting to enrol into it but was told the class was full. Found out week 12 of the previous year when we enrolled for third year, that id possibly have to stay back for the following year in order to graduate. By the end of this trimester I will supposedly have 180 out of 240 credits. Although, I understand that there would be confusion if they would have mid year entry to major studio project 1 it'd be a time saver for some of us. I wish I was made aware of this being something that held such importance but it never really made itself known from the teachers kind of q&amp;a at the end of the trimesters. Why hasn't this been made a thing yet? Is organisation skills not up to par enough to make a mid year selection. Why are so many classes a number of us wished to take mid year not available until the following year? We know the teachers have lives outside of education, but so do students. I already had to drop one of my three classes of this tri because a family member passed and we\u2019re moving by a months time from now. That\u2019s another thing, I tried applying for an extension, but was taken aback due to not having the proof of d\u2014\u2014 and contract for our next lease papers. The latter hasn\u2019t been given to us until now, it\u2019s week 12 and I\u2019m not able to get a certificate of the former from my family, since the funeral is overseas. Talk about over exertion. I\u2019m a fine arts student, I can\u2019t imagine what it might be like in the subjects that Griffith actually prioritises.",

            "comment": "Satutory declarations can normally help for the extensions. Might only get the min. extension for your reasoning though. Worth a shot, just make sure you're firm on how large of an effect your extenuating circumstances have had on your ability to work, life balance and mental (&amp; physical) health. A doctor's note for mental health/stress can help too, since these events absolutely do affect your ability to perform academically.\n\n  \n\n\nI feel you on the courses &amp; communication about requirements etc. It's 2021 and this information should be presented in an easily digestible format, online for all to access. Tools to help you plan and prioritise based on what you have already completed would also be extremely helpful, rather than having to wait days for assistance from the helpdesk. Alternatives should also be offered when mandatory classes can fill up (wtf???). Seems as though some schools are not offered nearly as much structure, information, and paradoxically flexibility as other schools such as Health and Business. Really wish that I had taken computer science elsewhere.",

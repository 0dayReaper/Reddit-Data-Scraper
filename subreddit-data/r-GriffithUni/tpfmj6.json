    "postText": "is there anyone studying Bachelor of Nursing at Griffith University? how hard it is to study and cope with the semesters? is it manageable? Did you need any advanced prerequisite/knowledge to study it? what are the things you struggled with and advise a new student to do beforehand to not face that many problems while studying for Bachelor of Nursing?  \n\n\n Also, is it possible to do part-time besides studying for a Bachelor of Nursing?",

If you do not get accepted on the 4th, you will not be able to enrol for March courses. You may wish to consider starting in the second trimester if this should happen.",

History or classics) and that will count as a prerequisite for university, but in Australia you must do English in year 12 (year 13 in my case). The bridging course is only actually eligible to Australian and New Zealand students.",

            "comment": "I am a part of the college and think the only part that's really helpful is the mentoring part. If you pick a good mentor and meet up with them. I see mine maybe like 2-3 times a year.  \nOther than that, it gives very 'corporate', watch these TED talks and network kinda vibes which I dont think you reaaallly need to be a part of the honours college to do. I am an older student though so I may not find the advice very useful where as someone who doesn't have much job/life experience might! Its what you make of it really. They emphasise extra curricular programs ect, literally said in the first lecture to work less, move in with the parents if you can, don't be an introvert.. big eye roll. \n\nSo it depends on your circumstances. If you are young, got lots of time to put on all these cool programs they do, go for it! If you're extremely busy like me, paying off a house ect, its still worth it for the mentor, but you could still get chummy with your tutors instead and get advice that way. Best of luck!",

I am a first year student in the Bachelor of Advanced Business (Hons) and I\u2019m still not sure if it automatically makes me a member of the Honours College. It seems way harder to get in touch with them than any other club or association in the university. How do I arrange a mentor and stuff?",

You have to apply to become a part of the honours college, when applied I it was a reference, GPA of 6.5, a cv detailing academic, community and career achievements. It is detailed all on the Griffith website if you want to apply",

Some I never see other than their name on a page, or an occasional email.  Some others I have had the pleasure of seeing them move through undergraduate to postgraduate study, and even complete PhDs.\n\nIf you are going to be a member, you have to actively make use of the mentoring while you're at Uni.  Some mentors are more eager to help than others.\n\nBut once you leave the Uni, realistically no-one will care one bit.  It doesn't open any cheat codes, secret handshakes, or gold bathrooms.",

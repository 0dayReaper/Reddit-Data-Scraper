    "postText": "So, I believe I've asked about this before and I've just finished the third year of my degree, however, the cornerstone subject I have to stay and do so I can graduate.Since I started my art studies, I noticed from previous uni studies that after one semester I could only handle three subjects at absolute most. Otherwise, I've been swamped and nowhere so far will give me casual work because of it. It's been particularly stressful seeing as I am now in my (unintentional) fourth year. Due to me missing a subject that is in two parts to graduate. Some Alumni I've built friendships with seeing them at their shows and such have said that they didn't have any subjects that kept them from graduating such as this. As in, I believe it's been only recently that they've added these subjects to build up the students with other somewhat professionalism.\n\nI had transferred credits from previous relevant studies, but this only added 30 more credits despite it being at least a couple of years of visual arts diploma and advanced diploma. I was a little stunned, it wasn't like these expired. However, the Advanced diploma of visual arts no longer exists as TAFE discarded it as soon as my class graduated. They decided to work with the University of Canberra.\n\nThis I gotta say was 2015, so I'm not sure if that interfered with the relevancy of possible credits. My main thing now is that I for the last couple of years had to stick with three/two subjects at once because of mental illness that keeps me for one, and two because there was so much content that if I had any more classes I couldn't have the GPA I'm trying to keep. So, what I'm asking is whether anyone has done similar concerning subjects or if anyone has tried fast-tracking?\n\nTwo subjects seem the capacity I can keep at, but I am doing my best. And even with two, if I tell interviewers I have university study many have apologised and said whatever casual/part-time jobs weren't for me... Almost like they don't want students to survive, what on earth is going on? Even in a job description, there's a \"promise\" of bringing flexibility, I guess that's for the younger people, not for a 26-year-old.\n\nNot to mention I feel guilty whenever I'm turned down from a job, how many more years will be jobless? I've been searching for years, graduated studies when the job-searching wasn't working out, looking through jobs through the uni site too even looking into internships or volunteering again...\n\nTLDR: Currently Unemployed student doing an unintentional fourth year, straining my partner and me if I don't find work. If I want work I need to cut down to two subjects instead of three. But jobs are turning me down nonetheless. \n\nEdit: I'd like to note that I've been the only one out of my mother, sister and me, that hasn't taken a break from the studies. I had a gap between diplomas, that's about it.  Their degrees are taking 6 years part-time and or have had work in between and haven't graduated yet. I already am doing my best but the pressure is on and I'm trying to keep it from impacting my mental health too much. My partner says he's not dealing well because he works and I have only studied... He's seen, heard and has previously taken me to interviews... It's not like I haven't been trying to find work...",

This week I'll get over 20hrs work but it varies.  There are also other jobs like pizza delivery, uber eats, coffee shops, Macca's, Coles and Woolies.  At the same time I'm currently interviewing for full-time permanent jobs in the industry I'm passionate about. No one has raised an eyebrow about my working 40+ hrs a week and studying because I've been doing it for years now.\n\nDon't fall into the trap of looking for a job in the profession that you want to get into. Go after any job and then start applying for the jobs you really want.  It looks really good to employers when candidates can demonstrate a history of working and studying.\n\nGood luck",

Lots of recruiters side huddle writing resumes, cover letters and also teaching interview techniques.  \n\nThe other thing you can do is approach all the companies where you would really like to work one day and ask for an internship and for them to give you a reference and feedback about your work as you job hunt.\n\nThat way you get on the job training and a foot in the door and they get free labour.",

It might be part of like the science+ or whatever but Griffith does have a strong emphasis on post graduation employability so take advantage of those services while you have access to them. The student connect or library should print you in the right direction for these resume builder services. Good luck!\n\nOh and don't give up. We all need to make sacrifices to go through uni and it affects those around us too. Keep at it, eventually there is an end and then a whole new beginning for the next step :)",

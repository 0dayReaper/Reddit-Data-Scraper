I majored in Software Development, and wasn't overly impressed by the school's curriculum and resources. I think that at the Gold Coast campus it's obvious that other schools (Health, Business, Law) are more established and prioritised higher.",

Internal classes are mainly the whole reason I'm planning on transferring as the university I attend currently is too far away for me to attend daily and online classes suck.",

As for workshops/tutorials even though I've picked the in person option every time it's mostly online anyways. I think the first year and second year classes may have more options for in-person since they have more students in them but I'm not really sure. Overall I've been disappointed by how many classes have been online especially the lectures. I got to do 4 weeks of in person lectures before we went online. I really struggle to pay attention in online lectures and I find it hard to stay motivated to keep attending.",

It's 2022 now and the pandemic restrictions are much much lighter nowadays and still there is no option for in-person class?\n\nIs this just for computer science in particular? I live near a Griffith University campus and I see many students attending nowadays.\n\nI'm in UQ right now and we have in-person classes for basically everything, with the option of online for some classes. I'm doing online right now since I live too far away to physically attend the uni everyday and like you said it is not a fun experience whatsoever so I was really hoping to be able to attend campus everyday if I transferred to Griffith.\n\nThat's a real shame tbh.",

I chose in person classes for all 4 of my classes. Of the 4 all the lectures are online and 3 of the workshops are online. So only one of my classes has an in person class. I ended up just attending that class online since it's not worth going to uni for just 1 two hour workshop a week.",

From talking to people it seems like most people prefer the online classes. I don't think they have enough budget to offer both in person and online classes. I just wish they wouldn't give me the option of picking in person classes just to let me down every time. I will mention this is my experience at the Gold Coast campus. The Nathan campus may have more options for in person workshops but I'm pretty sure their lectures are still online.",

Employers value that much more",

[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/GriffithUni/comments/x5k4h1/academicsurvey_participants_online_oncampus/) an example. They come across like ads however and don't really have much to do with Griffith other than they might be students here doing post-grad research.\nThey're usually nice enough to ask before posting.\n\nI will abide by the results of this poll.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/11xclgf)",

The actual management of the place could listen to the students a bit more, and they seem insanely money hungry with all the extra costs and exorbitant parking fees....but then I don't know what that's like at UQ. \n\nAlso Griffith students seem to be filthy, the common areas have trash all over the desks and chairs, with bins 10m away...",

            "comment": "I went to both griffith and UQ. While I liked UQ's campus a lot more (in terms of aesthetics), it certainly had it's fair share of 40 year old shitty buildings. Griffith (nathan) on the other hand seems pretty modern with a lot of new buildings. I've only been to the GC campus a handful of times, but based on that I found it to be a really nice campus.\n\nIn terms of teaching quality I think my experience at UQ was marginally better, though both rate excellent in this aspect with lecture recordings, large lecture halls and tutorial rooms, lots of computers available etc.\n\nSocially I made more friends and had a better time at UQ, but that's really down to me and not the uni.\n\nAll in all, I think most major campuses across Australia are much of a muchness, I've studied at southern cross in Coffs Harbour as well as Monash in Melbourne for reference.",

If you don't mind asking, what's your course and do you actually enjoy the campus atmosphere? Are the lectures good enough and is it worth studying in Nathan especially for this particular course, if you have any clue about it? Also, are you able to meet the living expenses and what are the part time job opportunities out there?",

I know you asked this question 2 months ago and may not be interested anymore and so I won't waste time writing out a big response. However, if you still are, feel free to ask me any questions about the degree.",

I am asking around for my partner, who has done flying through the private route, getting his cpl, getting his atpl unfrozen, the whole rot etc. He\u2019s looking to get formal qualification (i.e. a Diploma or degree) so he can fall back on that for other aviation-related careers rather than be the guy who can only fly planes but can\u2019t do anything else.\n\nWould be great if you could share your experience on things such as whether you had any prior knowledge before starting the course, how steep the learning curve is, are lecturers helpful, is coursework collaborative or practical/exam heavy etc. I\u2019ve been on the website and have seen the list of units, but it\u2019s not the same as talking to someone who has gone through it. \n\nThanks in advance.

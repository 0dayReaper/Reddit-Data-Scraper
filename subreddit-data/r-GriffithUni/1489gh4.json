    "postText": "Hi everyone, hope you're all doing well. \nI have my orientation on the 10th of july which unfortunately I won't be able to attend. My classes start from the 17th so I'll be trying my level best to get to Brisbane with a few days to spare before my classes. What will I be missing out on ? Are there any things that are absolutely necessary to start my journey at Griffith GC that i might be missing out on ? Also do you need to register for  courses for your first trimester or have they already been registered? If not, what is the cutoff time to register for courses for your first trimester ?",

You should probably have received an email from Griffith on how to get started. \nIf you get stuck call the general enquiry number, they will help you. \nIf you wait too long to register for classes you\u2019ll miss out on the times/classes that suit your schedule best. \nOnce you get logged on and have registered for your classes I\u2019d suggest reading through the course profiles online and set up Microsoft teams",

Vast majority of classes are not attendance marked so you will not be penalised for not being there. No rush at all. Good luck.",

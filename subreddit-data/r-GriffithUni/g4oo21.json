If you\u2019re bored from Coronavirus self-isolation, I suggest you stimulate your mind and have a read of the following and complete the survey, both of which are below:\n\nI am a high school student (from QASMT) doing university style research on consumer behaviour and e-scooter vandalism. Part of my survey requires investigating the cause and effect of consumer e-scooter behaviour: consumer attitudes and incentives, alongside the actual behaviours themselves. Most significant behaviour reported are helmet stealing and escooter dumping (particularly in ponds or rivers). \n\nCandidates: anyone, any age of people who know or have been on Lime or Neuron scooters in Brisbane, and apparently there is some moral hazard behaviour.\n\nIf you are willing to complete this survey, here is the link below:\n\n\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/WJLCMNF\n\nNOTE:\n\n- COVID-19 has forced lime scooters to be recalled, so this survey could be for those who have ridden lime scooters before they were removed",

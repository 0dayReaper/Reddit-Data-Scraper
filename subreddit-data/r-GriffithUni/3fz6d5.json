    "postText": "Hello guys,\n\nI'm finishing Computer Networking and Technical Support 2 year Diploma program at Seneca College of Applied Arts and Technology, Toronto, Canada and I'm heavily considering Griffith to continue my education. I'm planning to enter Bachelor of IT, however I'm not sure which major to choose. I'm kinda interested in Information Systems and Business Analysis and a bit less in Information Technology Management and Marketing. As far as I understand, the Gold Coast campus is better than Nathan in terms of activities that surrounding area offers. In addition I fell in love with pictures of Gold Coast and really would prefer to spend most of my time there. The issue is that the major I'm mostly interested in has most major courses offered at Nathan. And as for now, I don't know what to choose, the better campus or better major. \nI would really appreciate if someone would help me to make up my mind and tell their experience at Nathan VS Gold Coast, Brisbane VS Gold Coast and Information Systems and Business Analysis VS Information Technology Management and Marketing.\n\nThanks",

If you go the GC campus route, you get to be very close to the beach with a really modern campus. Nathan is a bit of an older campus, but is being renovated and is honestly looking pretty good these days. Brisbane is a cool city, heaps of renting options that is only about 45 mins drive from the beach anyway (depending on where in Brissy you live). \n\n&gt;  As far as I understand, the Gold Coast campus is better than Nathan in terms of activities that surrounding area offers.\n\nNot too sure about that, Brisbane is a growing city that has heaps to do in it. But yeh, Gold Coast has the beach which is awesome!\n\n&gt;  Information Systems and Business Analysis VS Information Technology Management and Marketing.\n\nI wish I could help here but I can't sorry!\n\nlet me know if you have any further questions!\n",

            "comment": "I've spent a fair bit of time in both places so I can throw in my two cents. \n\nI studied my two degrees at Nathan and I enjoyed living in Brisbane. I find that while Brisbane isn't the most active place, it is very easy to live in. Public transport is alright and there's enough to do in the city surrounds to keep you busy, but its not so busy that you're distracted. There are a lot of nice markets and festivals and things popping up in recent years that have really given Brisbane a much more cultural feel. \n\nNathan campus is in a nice position on top of a hill about 30 minutes by bus from the CBD. The surrounds are pretty relaxed and there's a major shopping centre about 15 minutes or so by bus from the campus. I lived about 20 minutes walk from the campus and I found it such an easy place to live in that I stayed in the same place for 7 years. \n\nAs for the Gold Coast, I must admit that I never used to like the place despite growing up there, but I have taken a shine to it recently. It is a nice place in a lot of ways. Great nature, great beaches and a pretty active nightlife. It's also a tourist meccha so the streets of Surfers Paradise in particular will be paved with different nationalities. My main bone to pick with the Gold Coast however is a lack of any central area. In Brisbane you have the CBD and on the Gold Coast you have pockets of high populations with no real centre. It makes public transport a nightmare in a lot of ways but that really depends on where you live and where you want to go. \n\nThere is a newly established light rail system that goes to the Griffith Gold Coast down to about Broadbeach where you can catch buses or go to a large shopping centre, Pacific Fair. It has gotten a lot better than it was in the past, but if you're not living on that main strip, it's a pain to get around. \n\nThe campus at the Gold Coast is a big one and a nice one. As the side bar says \"probably the best campus\" and its not far off. It's big, modern and probably an overall nicer campus than Nathan. I haven't been there too often, but it has probably become the premier Griffith Campus. \n\nGold Coast as an area for activities is pretty good if you enjoy the outdoors or water sports. It doesn't have quite the same cultural appeal as Brisbane and it certainly doesn't feel like a city, but it is busy. It is a busy, busy place. Brisbane has its moments as well, but, maybe I'm biased, but it feels calmer overall. \n\nAs for your two programs, I think you just have to choose what is best for your future. If you think Information Systems and Business Analysis is better for you than the other one, then hang the other criteria and study it. What is the main reason you want to come to Australia? Is it to party and have a good time, or is it to study? If it's the former, you may as well save your money and come here on a working holiday visa. If you've come here to study, then you'll be fine whether you go to Brisbane or the GC.\n\nTL;DR: They both have strong and weak points, you need to decide what your main priority is.",

I was able to do the majority of my subjects on the Gold Coast and only had to drive up to Nathan for three of them. This could be an option that you have not thought of and could be a win+win for you. If you have any questions about the degree/major I'm happy to answer them.",

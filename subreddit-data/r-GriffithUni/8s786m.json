    "postText": "Hey everyone, looking into studying Masters in Speech in the future and was wondering if anyone had any insights on the differences between the 2 campuses? \n\nIf you would choose 1 over the other, why? \n\nI'd love a vibrant student atmosphere and social experience. People generally happy to be on campus, quality amenities or services like food outlets for example. Also what about the surrounding area of the campus? Rentals and sharehouses nearby are also important.\n\nThanks!\n",

G40, or Griffith Health Building, is also a public clinic so it\u2019s possible to get really immersed in it. We have some pretty nice food outlets on campus (GyG, burger urge, flavour Asia, uni bar, etc.), but I\u2019m not sure about renting in the area. I\u2019d recommend you look online around Parkwood and Southport. \n\nWe have an open day on Sunday the 12th, so if you want to have a look around campus, you should definitely come, plus I\u2019ll be there.",

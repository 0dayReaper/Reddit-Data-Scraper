At Griffith talented  students get to do internships at local studios, which often leads to a job after graduation. I don\u2019t know if other schools can provide similar opportunities. In terms of things that you actually get to learn - I think it\u2019s very similar to other schools.",

            "comment": "Currently doing a BA Animation at Griffith (looking to change degrees because I\u2019ve realised I don\u2019t want a career as a creative artist). Can confirm that the program is great though. Students and tutors are all super friendly, staff have great industry experience and offer valuable feedback. The course generally is very rigorous however, but I think that is reflective of the work standard you need to make it in such a highly competitive industry. It has good connections with local studios (such as Ludo, who produce Bluey) and many students have been employed straight out of uni by them. The resources on offer are really good as well, you get full access to labs, software, student-run art groups and more. If you\u2019re super dedicated to the craft, I would really recommend it. Griffith is a really inclusive uni too, and offers great student support. Just be prepared to put in a lot of extra work outside of class, which can be insanely exhausting. That\u2019s just the case with animation though.",

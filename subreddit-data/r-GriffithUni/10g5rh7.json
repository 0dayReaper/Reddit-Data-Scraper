            "comment": "Hey Student Mentor here! \n\n\nI am doing a Science Degree and maintaining a 5+ GPA (can finish my degree with Distinction). Uni is nothing like high school so you'd be best to cut the chord as you're transitioning to adult hood. You won't be given super strict instructions to complete tasks and what not. That now falls on you. \n\n\nHere is a link to the [Grading Schema](https://www.griffith.edu.au/students/assessment-exams-grades/grades) that spells out what each level means. \n\n\nNothing is easy, per se. You will need to commit to studying and revising the content. Ensure you shift your priorities to make school a high one. Be disciplined. Be curious. \nAttend your lectures, tutorials and labs. Do extra reading if you are not sure of a subject (or are super interested in one).\n\n\nAsk for help from tutors and convenors before it becomes critical. And if you know a certain subject isn't your strongest this is when Ps get the degrees (I bombed oChem so just wanted to pass it and move on).\n\n\nLook after your mental health. Do not go all in and neglect things that makes you happy and sane. Be sure to play a little! Meditation and yoga helps. \n\n\nAnd for the love of all things laboratory, read your lab manual BEFORE class so you are prepared. The labs in first year are pretty cool, but they are more fun when you know how to make the reactions happen. \n\n\nHappy for you to DM me if you want more advice.",

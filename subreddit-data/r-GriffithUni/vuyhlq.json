    "postText": "Hey guys! I'm starting my very first degree in my life at Griffith this trimester and I was wondering if anyone would know whether it would be a good idea to get a laptop for Information Technology with Creative Coding/Foundation of Systems Development or just stick to paper/pen learning for note taking and stuff.\n\nI do have a desktop at home and I understand that Griffith does have computers on campus to do work with but wasn't sure whether it would be to my benefit to consider a cheap laptop.\n\nThanks!",

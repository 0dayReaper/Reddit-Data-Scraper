Honestly though it's probably not worth going to all three days unless you really want to - if you can though don't skip any safety inductions for the studios. Not sure if these are being held in o-week or not though.\n\nThe first morning is probably the most important - you get a chance to meet the lecturers and get a solid overview of the program. Plus this is probably when they'll give you your swipe card for the buildings and get you to sign release forms and such.\n\nMost of the activities at the film school o-week in previous years have been heavily weighted to activities for film students (eg film screenings, discussions with local documentary filmmakers) and not offering much for the games or animation students, which sucks. Though I heard they wanted to change that, so things may be different this year.",

Working in film is about networking, communication, having fun on the way, but most of all it's going to be a lot of sitting around and waiting for things to happen.\n\nif you can't even be bothered to go to orientation you are in for a rough ride mate.\n\nAlso, this is when they teach you how to hire gear and all the rules for the studios which you will 100% need to know\n\nAlso making friends now will make doing assessment SO MUCH EASIER",

I don't think it's necessary and found that film school really suffers from a lot of the academia bullshit that ends up being more value to the uni, than to you as a learner.",

Other comments are right, you'll meet people and maybe get some goodies. The events are disorganised and random which was fun, I watched a documentary on a dead producer and then tried the awful games made by third year game design students. At one event they'd hired students from the acting course to go undercover and pretend to be film students",

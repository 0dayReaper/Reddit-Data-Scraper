    "postText": "As sent by university management: \n\n&gt; Dear Students\n\n&gt; From 31 May, all Griffith campuses will become no smoking campuses.\n\n&gt; The no smoking initiative will be implemented by all Queensland universities to ensure our staff, students and visitors are provided with a safe and healthy environment.\n\n&gt; For those staff and students who wish to quit smoking, the University will be offering free cessation programs which can be accessed on our website.\n\n&gt; Responses to a range of frequently asked questions about the no smoking initiative are also provided on this website. However, if you have a question which is not addressed, please contact safety@griffith.edu.au.\n\nWhat are some alternate locations? I sure hope this is communicated to the international students as well.",

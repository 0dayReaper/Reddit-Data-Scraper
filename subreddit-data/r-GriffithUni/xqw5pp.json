    "postText": "I\u2019m a Griffith Alumni and found 2 weeks ago that my Griffith Google Account was deleted. I have used the account daily so picked it up as soon as it occurred. Griffith IT have advised this was part of a move away from Google linked accounts (although I wasn\u2019t advised prior).\n\nI\u2019ve lost access to the Google Photos account linked to my @griffithuni.edu.au account and have spent the past 2 weeks trying to have this recovered via the Migration Team. Has anyone else experienced the same and had any luck in recovering their data?\n\nWhen I attempt to recover it directly via Google it says the Admin (i.e Griffith) will need to do this.",

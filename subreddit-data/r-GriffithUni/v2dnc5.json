    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am currently undertaking a Graduate Certificate in Mental Health Practice. I am based in Victoria and studying online. I have not studied in more than 7 years and a bit rusty on my academic stills. I am having trouble with learning APA 7. Yes, I am referring to the school referencing guide. Some of the rules are making sense but some are not. I am also having difficulty with paraphrasing. \n\nI am looking for a tutor that understands APA 7 and that can help me improve my referencing and paraphrasing skills. The tutor can be online or face to face. I am hoping to find a tutor to proof read my drafts and can provide feedback on how to improve my essays. The tutor I hired is not really helping me with the areas I am having trouble with. They just edit my formatting and change some of my wording. \n\nIf you know someone who might be able to assist please drop me a line :)",

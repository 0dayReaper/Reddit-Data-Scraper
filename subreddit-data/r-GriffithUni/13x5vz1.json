    "postText": "So I\u2019m currently in the process of completing a Diploma in Justice Studies at TAFE and completed a Cert IV and justice studies 2 years ago, and am looking at going into the Bachelor in Criminology and Criminal Justice. After doing some research I discovered that I could be eligible for a credit transfer for the degree. I was just wondering if anyone could give an insight on what can I expect from credit transfers at Griffith University?",

Use both subjects outlines and course profiles, not their name. \n\nAfter a few weeks, you'll get an email saying some of them were accepted or not.\n\nOn your academic transcript, it'll have the subjects at the top with \"Credit transfer\" or something instead of a GPA.",

I'm wondering if you are trolling, and have never been to a Brisbane Campus, let alone Griffith.\n\nUniversity isn't some 'hotbed' of disenfranchised students, no matter what you read. 40% of the campus are international students who don't give a shit about our politics, 25% nurses who are awesome drinkers and shit talkers, and 30% business students who enjoy the benefits of capitalism. There's 5% there who would be deemed unwashed hippies, but they don't make enough numbers to be noticed. ",

The Greens and socialist alternative were recruiting with flyers. All the posters were leftist - pro Cuba etc. You got marked down for using a word like 'chairman' - even if referring to a man.\n\nNo conservative discussion was openly held. Everyone was \"racist\".\n\nI know someone who goes to Griffith now and he says it's the same.\n\nHe had a MAGA sticker on his bag and was abused every day - even had one nut tear it off while it was on his back while holding the bag.\n\nCan you imagine this happening if someone wore a Marx tshirt (I've seen one there)? I mean Marx is the politics of envy and hatred of the other who they think holds them down. The flawed ideology resulted in 100 million dead. That's OK? ",

I'm not condoning extreme right ideology either. I'm old enough to know all all the current political debate happening amongst 16-30 year olds is all a distraction. It's a rehash of political distraction that comes along every 15 or so years, yet no change ever occurs. In short, it's just a distraction, neither the extreme left or right are \"awake\".\n\nSecondly, what you are describing has not occured at Nathan Campus, at least not in the last 5 years. There just is not any political activism regardless of how much you seem to want there to be.\n\nThere are some loser socialist alternative kids who hand our flyers and then get moved on by security, but I've only ever seen 1 or 2 students talking to them in any serious context. In total they number about 5-10 students. Across a campus of over 8,000 it's not worth mentioning.\n\nThis sub isn't T_D, r/ liberal, r/politics. You seem to be seeking reassurances for your way of thinking or an argument, go to one of those echochamber subs which are notorious for banning people with alternative POVs. This is a sub for students and family to get information and ideas about Griffith University.",

You have come to a specific university campus sub, and there is no political ideology. What conclusions would you draw? \n\na) Its a highly active sub with overzealous admins who stamp out all political debate opposed to their prescribed beliefs, to enforce their echochamber.\n\nb) the campus has almost non-existent political activity, because people at this university just don't seem to be concerned with the false narrative of politically motivated groups.\n\nSeeing the tiny amount of members, and very little activity, which do you think is most likely?\n\nHint: this uni isn't an inner city campus in Melbourne or Sydney.

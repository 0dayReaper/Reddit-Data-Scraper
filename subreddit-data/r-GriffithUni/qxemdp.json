    "postText": "planning my enrolment for tri 1 next year, and trying to make it work with my employment. There is a class where I only have one timetable option for an online seminar, and I would rather have that time free for work. What are seminars exactly, and is attendance compulsory? I would assume it's something I could watch at a later time as it's an online session, or am I misunderstanding?",

But, it may not be, so your best bet is to email the teachers in charge of that course, whose info I think may be on the course profiles? I'm not entirely sure on that one",

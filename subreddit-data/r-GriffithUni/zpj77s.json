I have my 3 electives left and the final recommended Strategy course to fulfil. I\u2019m looking at doing 3 leadership subjects as my electives and have enrolled in Managing Organisational Transformation as well as Leading Teams in semester 1 2023. Has anyone here done these courses? What are the assessments like? Presentations or essays? Any info would be appreciated.",

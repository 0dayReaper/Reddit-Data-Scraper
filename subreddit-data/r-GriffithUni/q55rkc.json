    "postText": "Today when I walked into my economics class I saw something I dread every time I close my eyes. Someone had brought their new gaming laptop to class. The Forklift he used to bring it was still running idle at the back. I started sweating as I sat down and gazed over at the 300kg beast that was his laptop. He had already reinforced his desk with steel support beams and was in the process of finding an outlet for a power cable thicker than Amy Schumer's thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that there's nothing to worry about. He somehow finds a damn outlet. Tears are running down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family saying I love them. The PASS leader starts the class, and the student turns his laptop on. The colored lights on his RGB Backlit keyboard flare to life like a nuclear flash, and a deep humming fills my ears and shakes my very soul. The entire city power grid goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from vibrant life, to a dark, earth shattering void where my body is getting torn apart by the 150km/hour gale force winds and the 500 decibel groan of the cooling fans. As my body finally surrenders, I weep, as the nathan campus and Brisbane go under. I really hate gaming laptops. \\[Nathan Campus\\]",

He\u2019ll stonk a few leveraged crypto trades and end up living in his Nan\u2019s bungalow in Enoggera. Next time you\u2019ll bump into him in 10 years time, he\u2019ll be either serving choc-tops at Village or in the tool isle at Bunnings, this happens in Stafford btw.",

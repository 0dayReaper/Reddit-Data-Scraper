So my question is what\u2019s supposed to happen in terms of communication from the school about classes, orientation, covid, etc. ? When can I expect an email?",

BUT it did say on my offer and CoE that orientation starts at March 7 meanwhile classes start March 14. Also I got a question, do you have your \u201cmygriffith\u201d student portal logins already? Cause I still only have the application/admission portal and I tried registering for the mygriffith but it\u2019s like locked or something. I sent an email to an admissions officer about that like 2 weeks ago yet there\u2019s no reply...",

Also just wondering, doesn\u2019t the enrollment for trimester 1 2022 open around the 3rd week of November tho... so does that mean students should have their student portals by then? \n\nHonestly, I\u2019ll just call them and ask for clarifications hahaha. Thanks tho for the reply :)",

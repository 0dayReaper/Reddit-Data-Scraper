    "postText": "There's no student unions representing us. The academics and admin and even the library officers trample all over us just because they can. And then there's the goody two shoes cleaners who steal our shit when you're not watching. And then there's our chancellor who gets paid $7 million a year (or did I underestimate it) who runs promotions based no less on the theory of our beloved president snow (hunger games) on promoting the acad who can most severely ruin or disfigure any students' life. Everyday we go to a prison and we prepared lots of lub cus you can't do no shit but get fucked by the prison guards. Upvote you Griffith inmates. Is this really different from rest of our business oriented universities elsewhere though?",

This doesn't reflect my experience studying at Griffith at all.\n\nI never felt \"trampled on\".\n\nNever had stuff stolen, in fact, I've had things like usb keys turned in to lost and found.\n\nNot sure I care what the chancellor earns.\n\nDidn't feel like a prison to me, given I learned a bunch, graduated and got a job in the industry.",

I've spent a fair bit of time at GC/NA and LG and can't say I've experienced any of this\n\nLack of a good student council at Nathan I could agree with, especially considering the awesome stuff the Gold Coast one does for everyone down there, but *being trampled on* sounds a bit exaggerated ",

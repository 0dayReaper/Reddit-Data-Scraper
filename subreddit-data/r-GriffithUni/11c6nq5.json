    "postText": "Specifically netball and volleyball. I haven\u2019t played beyond primary school level on both these sports, however want to try group sports again as it seems like fun. Woukd signing up for social sports be a good idea considering my skill level? I go to uq and was going to sign up for social netball there, but I was warned by various students that uq is pretty competitive and not that good for beginners like myself, unlike Griffith which some friends said was more laid back. Any thoughts? Thank you!",

Luckily we were there for fun but we never competed to their levels.",

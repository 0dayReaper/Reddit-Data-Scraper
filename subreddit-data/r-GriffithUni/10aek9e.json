            "comment": "Hey there, \nI\u2019m just finishing up a major in Italian at Griffith and I had mixed feelings about the courses offered. Generally I think your experience learning a language at uni is very much influenced by whether or not you\u2019ve had prior language-learning experience or not. If you\u2019ve already done some Italian at school you\u2019ll find that learning it again at uni will be more of the same things that you\u2019ve already been taught (as they start from the very basics)\n\nHowever, if it\u2019s your first time learning Italian it\u2019s not too bad, the teachers are very patient and kind, willing to explain concepts in further depth if you need help understanding something.\n\nIf you\u2019re doing the Italian courses in person, the classes can be quite fun and engaging. The Italian teacher in Brisbane is fantastic. However, if you\u2019re studying online, it can be quite tiring and of course there are the disadvantages of having to learn through a screen rather than ask questions face to face. (I did a mix of online and in person) and found the online class to be quite long and at an inconvenient time - there aren\u2019t several timetable options, just one.\n\nI would say that to truly achieve a high level of Italian through the university courses, it is really important to study it well and practice as much as you can. I saw a lot of students sit through the 2 years of Italian and still really struggle to string a sentence together by the end of it. Like any subject (but particularly for Italian as it\u2019s a language), the more effort you put in the more you will get out.\n\nOverall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s really interesting and quite achievable as long as you stay on top of the work and put in the effort. Hope this helps",

I haven't learned any Italian at all so that's nice to hear. \n\nI'm living quite far away from campus so will probably do most classes online but am glad to know that the option exists to do a mix of both. I'll try to get to the classes as much as I can. \n\nHow does that work by the way? If you are an online student and you want to go to a class in person, do you have to let them know in advance or can you just turn up?",

I don\u2019t think they will have a problem with it- so long as you clarify it with them beforehand",

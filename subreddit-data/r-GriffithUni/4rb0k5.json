    "postText": "I am currently applying to Griffith for pharmacy. I saw the post from a long time ago and had a few questions of my own. I'd appreciate any help or where the best place to find the answers would be.  \n1. What would the equivalent of an 80.40 ATAR score be as a percentage roughly. \n2. How is the public transit there? Do the busses run often? \nAnd finally the most important question...\n3. How far away are the beaches? I really want to learn how to surf :)\n\nHopefully there are still some active users who can help me out. \n\n",

There is a light-rail that runs from the Gold Coast Campus that can get you easy access to Southport, Surfers Paradise or Broadbeach. More information [here](https://www.griffith.edu.au/international/life-in-australia/transport) and [here](http://jp.translink.com.au/travel-information/network-information/stops-and-stations/stop/griffith-university-gold-coast-campus/timetable/2016-07-05).\n* Surfer's Paradise, known for it's beaches, will be [22 minutes away](http://ridetheg.com.au/%EF%BF%BCriding-the-g/time-table/) by light-rail from the Gold Coast Campus. \n\nTo be honest, you could look a lot of this stuff up by yourself with a little effort. This is your future you're talking about. You're going to a foreign country to study. \n\nMost of this information is on the Griffith website for International Students which I suggest you browse a bit more if you come up with any other questions. Griffith has a lot of information on its website for potential students.",

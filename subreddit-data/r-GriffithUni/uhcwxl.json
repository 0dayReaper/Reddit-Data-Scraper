    "postText": "Hi all, I'm currently due to graduate from psychology in honours at the end of this year. I am applying to all the MCP and MPP degrees in Australia, and am currently applying for the MCP and MPP in Griffith. I was wondering if anyone was willing to give me some advice on the application process and/or review my application? \n\nIn particular, how can we submit our official academic transcript if we won't get it until November 2022, but the applications close on 30 Sept 2022? What can I include on my personal statement? I was thinking, write about why I want to pursue ClinPsych (due to lived experience of immigrant culture/discrimination and intergenerational trauma, plus I want to work towards reducing the stigma for accessing mental health resources in the immigrant community and also ADHD in females), write about what I did in my paid job and volunteering experiences, and somehow link it back to how I can use the insight from them to better the community?\n\nI'm worried because I feel like the things I was thinking about writing would be too cliche and won't be unique enough for the assessors. \n\nThank you in advance for any advice!!",

The classes are good in the sense that they help set you up for your specific path way to the industry. The cohort is also really good. They\u2019re very welcoming and are considerate of things like mental health and well being. I\u2019m currently in my third year (final year) and so far it\u2019s intensive but enjoyable. Also all of the lecturers and tutors are really good and understanding, some of them even went to uni there first, then came back to do teaching. My tips would be to buy a Wacom pen with the student discount asap because in the start of the year they run out quite fast. Also the majority of the content is put online so even if you miss a class or don\u2019t remember all that was said, you can easily find what you need. Also also, the campus itself really isn\u2019t that big, so you won\u2019t need to worry about travelling from class to class. \n\nI hope this helps!! If you do end up going then I wish you the best of luck :))",

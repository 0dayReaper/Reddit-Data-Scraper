But as humans can sometimes miss the mark a little. If you give good reasons most will be reasonable. It could go to an independent marker but that is at the risk of the mark going down",

I have personally done this twice, I usually use the criteria or an assignment style discussed in class as my argument. \n\nAs bad as it sounds you are the customer. I will be 50k in debt after my degree, I'll be dammed if I don't get the best possible marks for it.",

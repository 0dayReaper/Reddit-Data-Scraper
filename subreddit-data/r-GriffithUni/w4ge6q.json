I even made questions on Anki that actually popped up in the exams! There are a bunch of YouTube videos you should watch before you start using it because it can look a bit confronting at first. But trust me it is so much better than taking notes from the lectures and never reading them again. \n\nIt also has a system to bring up harder cards earlier and easy cards later. You can see your study statistics for the day week and month. \n\nGood luck &lt;3",

I love the feature that allows you to bring hard cards on more often than easy ones :) I\u2019ve even posted on my teams group raving about it haha",

            "comment": "I'm at Nathan and it's pretty near Garden City and always has buses going too and from, it's also not too hard to get to Brisbane city from there because Mt Gravatt station is right next to it and has a near endless amount of buses heading into the city, dorms were $175 a week and that's about what the place I was staying at pre-dorms was too. Of course, I can't speak for Gold Coast since I haven't been there, but Nathan's pretty decent",

G52 is a particular favourite. Around the Woolworths is a few other things like a hairdresser/barber.",

            "comment": "I\u2019ve done a degree at Nathan and now 2 years in at the GC so I think I can give a fair comparison. Rent affordability I\u2019d say Nathan wins, at least in terms of nearby suburbs being on the whole cheaper than Southport etc. (at least when I was looking). I never looked into dorms so I\u2019m not sure how they compare, but I do know GC on campus student accom has a bad rep. \n\n\nLike someone else mentioned, Garden City is a 5 min bus ride from Nathan and has any shop/ food you could need. Brisbane CBD would be about 15-20 mins on the express bus from Nathan, so pretty close as well. \n\n\nGold Coast campus, on the other hand, has more stuff physically on campus food wise (Nathan doesn\u2019t have any chain food but GC has burger urge, gyg etc.) but doesn\u2019t have a super close major shopping centre like Nathan does. There is a woolies one tram stop/ 10 min walk away.\n\n\nPublic transport is great for gold coast, the tram goes  right to uni, and then it\u2019s about 15 mins on the tram to Southport or 20 mins to surfers, 30 minutes to pacific fair (easiest shopping centre to get to if you\u2019re not driving). \n\n\nUni wise, I\u2019ve found the quality of teaching equal in both campuses. The GC campus is a bit more modern but honestly both campuses have a good library that get the job done. Nathan campus to me felt like a nicer place to \u201cchill\u201d, it just feels less busy/ hectic than GC. But I\u2019ve loved the GC too.\n\n\nCan I ask what you\u2019re wanting to study?",

For basics like just going to garden city etc it\u2019s fine. But if you want to get out socialise go to the city etc it can be troublesome. \n\nGC campus has a busier vibe. I honestly think the cohort at gc is consistently more upbeat/social/interactive. Depends if that\u2019s your thing. Easier to get around with the tram etc.",

Not sure what the price on dorms are, I would assume they are the same?",

Nathan just feels like a more,,accessible? space? like there's seating and study areas everywhere and its a much more open plan whereas GC is more packed in buildings along one long road?",

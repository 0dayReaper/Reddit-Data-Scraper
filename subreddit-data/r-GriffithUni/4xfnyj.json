I don't know what to ask but can everybody tell your thoughts or experiences with the program? Or half the program of Infomation Systems or Suppy Chain Management.\n\nSo something like course design, teaching, lecturers, class size, materials/resources/books, work/job potentials,...\n\nAnd this program is available at Nathan campus.\n\nThanks!",

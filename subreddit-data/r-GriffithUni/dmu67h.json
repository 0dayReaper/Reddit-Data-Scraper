Was wondering if anyone had experience with intensive courses or even better, Spanish intensive experience. I want to get an idea of what I\u2019m in for. \n\nThanks \n\nP.s if you know of any courses that are intensive over tri 3 (can be any year) that are easy, please share",

Classes go for 3 hours, twice a week. You'll cover 12 weeks work in 6. Expect your work cut out for you if you want do well; unless if you're just repeating it just keep practicing I guess.",

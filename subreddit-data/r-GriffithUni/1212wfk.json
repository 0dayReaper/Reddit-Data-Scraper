    "postText": " I\u2019m current based in Melbourne and I\u2019m considering going to Griffith University (Nathan Campus). I'm currently browsing for off-campus accommodation.\n\nCan anyone please suggest suburbs that fit the following criteria?\n\n* Easy access to public transport to get to uni or around Brisbane. (I don\u2019t plan to get a car)\n* Walking proximity to Woolworths and/or Coles.\n* Walking proximity to restaurants and/or takeaway shops.\n* Desirable: Close to Auspost parcel locker, Chemist Warehouse.\n\nAlternatively may I know which suburbs are popular among students attending Griffith University (Nathan Campus)? Currently not considering on-campus accommodation or accommodation managed by uni. TIA",

Most of these are along the bus routes mentioned below.\n\nSunnybank, Sunnybank Hills and Calamvale all have large shopping centres and Mt Gravatt has the massive Westfield Garden City. There's a Chemist Warehouse at Garden City Westfield and Sunnybank, both locations also have parcel lockers and Woolies and Coles. Sunnybank Hills has both supermarkets too. All have restaurants and takeaways.",

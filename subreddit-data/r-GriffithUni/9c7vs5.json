    "postText": "Hey guys - I'm looking to study Medicine and came across Griffith's GPA entry requirements: \n\n\"Completed Masters by Coursework (or a combination of coursework and research) will have a GPA calculated from the graded components of the program for the duration of equivalent full-time years of study in the program with **the balance of the**  \n**GPA calculation being based on the final one or two years of the undergraduate degree**.\"\n\nSeriously - what does the \"balance of the calculation\" mean?  \n  ",

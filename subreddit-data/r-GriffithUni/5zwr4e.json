    "postText": "I want to put up a few flyers where my target audience are engineering and math students - in general, but particularly those studying the following courses:\nCVB101 General Chemistry \n\u00a0MZB126 Engineering Computation\n\u00a0MZB125 Introductory Engineering Mathematics\n\u00a0PVB102 Physics of the Very Small\nMXB106 Linear Algebra and Differential Equations \n\u00a0EGB121 Engineering Mechanics\n\u00a0EGB120 Foundations of Electrical Engineering\n\u00a0EGB111 Foundation of Engineering Design\n\nSo I know the most effective places to distribute said flyers, I would like to know which rooms these courses are taught in.\n\nSo my question is: Where can I get access to the timetables for these courses? I am not a Griffith Uni student and don't know anyone who is so anything that requires a login is ruled out.",

    "postText": "the river flooding that affected Logan was pretty full on and its damaged some infrastructure.\n\nAccess to the Logan campus is restricted currently. The normal route directly from the M1 is blocked along with the access road to Ikea and subsequently the alternate route to uni. Basically don't use that exit on the motorway. [Here is a screenshot with some scribble to show what I mean](https://imgur.com/gallery/MbsgI).\n\nI'm sure you could use the toll road on the other side, but just be aware.",

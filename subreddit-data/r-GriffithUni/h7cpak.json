    "postText": "Can anyone tell me about the Master of Screen Production at Griffith? I'm currently deciding between graduate film programs at University of Sydney, Griffith, and Deakin. Is it a hands on experience and are there good job placements? Is it worth the money? I'm American so I'm only applying to schools with International scholarships available. \n\nAny information would be helpful, thank you!",

            "comment": "Hey, I didn't do the Masters but I did the 3-year Bachelor of Film and Screen Media program, graduating in 2016.\n\nAs far as film courses go it's the most practical one that I could find in Queensland. First year gave me a good introduction to editing software, gear like Blackmagic Cinema Cameras and lighting, and there's a lot of practical exercises. One downside is that you are only allowed to take the gear out for course exercises and assessments - you do not have free reign to just borrow a camera out and go experiment. The editing labs were always open to me however and I know a lot of people took advantage of that to use it for editing their own projects etc - but if you already have an editing rig and software it'll be of less use to you. \n\nAs with every film course it's more about who you know and the relationships you forge than what you actually learned - out of the 80-odd people that actually graduated my course, maybe about 20 of them currently work in industry (not sure what it's like with corona nowadays). The Australian local film industry is basically non-existent outside of indies - out of those 20 people they nearly all have jobs in corporate video or broadcast.\n\nYou mentioned job placements - in my Bachelor we had to do a set amount of hours of \"work experience\" on either a production set or within a company somewhere in Australia to pass the course. A lot of people grinded this out on an indie feature that came to Griffith looking for crew. Myself, I did this within a corporate studio but I was one of the very few people that did. You're expected to find your qualifying placement yourself, and it's probably a medium difficulty of finding one but you may have to forget your aspirations of being on the set of the next Aquaman - those opportunities don't come round often.\n\nIf you can get a scholarship (ie a free ride), I would say Queensland is as good a place as any to study. Brisbane isn't quite a small town, but it isn't Sydney either. It's a nice place - provided you have your drivers licence and can get around easily and appreciate the nearby beauty of the Sunshine Coast, Gold Coast and the rest of nature. Wanna stress that - **without a drivers licence and a vehicle, your ability to enjoy the state will be greatly limited.** People expect you to be able to drive to and from set, or come to gear pickup. International students usually get a pass though, and you may be able to rely on others in your groups to drive for you.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions. I'm a Brisbane boy and I'm always happy to help out somebody curious about the state or about the local film industry.",

I'm torn because of the three schools it seems that Griffith has the strongest film program but based on what people have told me it seems smarter to build connections in Sydney or Melbourne as opposed to Brisbane. Do you find that the film community is rather small in Brisbane/ difficult to break into??",

                            "comment": "&gt; Is this all dep equipment or just the fancier stuff? \n\nI don't really understand what you mean. You have access to some pretty good, I would say maybe even professional-grade gear - for our graduate films in third year we shot on Arri Alexas (I think they may have Amiras now...) and we had access to FS5s for our Documentary module. I'm not sure what the Masters program has access to, but I imagine it's some good gear. This seems to be what the Film School spends its cash on - pretty decent gear.  But no, in my experience - **you cannot hire gear out if it's not specifically for a project.** They just don't have enough gear to go around with all the cohorts. When you do get the gear, you make the most of it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;based on what people have told me it seems smarter to build connections in Sydney or Melbourne as opposed to Brisbane. Do you find that the film community is rather small in Brisbane/ difficult to break into?? \n\nI'm going to turn this question back onto you. What's your goal with this placement, and for your career in general? Because that will determine what's best for you. I'm speaking from the perspective of a local who has tried to make it in Brisbane's film / video industry for a few years.\n\nLet's start frankly - Brisbane is smaller compared to Sydney or Melbourne, it's just a fact. It's a smaller city, there's a lot less cash and therefore a lot less local production. What people are telling you is technically correct, but there's more to it.\n\nBrisbane has a small and underfunded \"indie\" film scene, where most people are doing either passion project / crowdfunded features or trying to make a killer short film that will get them noticed at SXSW or other big festivals. These are tiny budgets, and a rotating roster of similar faces serving as crew. You'll probably work for credit / copy / meals if you get on these films - but the same people that work on these are also those working on features and corporates. If you're good to them and you prove your worth, you can get some good opportunities later (this has happened to friends of mine).\n\nFor feature films - we receive occasional windfalls when big productions come into town and want to crew up - a lot of local crew got employed on Pirates of the Caribbean, King Kong, Dora, and other movies. But this is seasonal, and if Screen Queensland decides to stop chipping in and essentially propping up the local industry this revenue stream will dry up. I would not count on this being your primary source of income - you will need to plug the gaps with corporate work most likely.\n\nBrisbane film industry people know their shit - and a lot of them work jobs interstate (in Sydney and Melbourne). It's worth building connections with people here the same as in Sydney and Melbourne because you have no idea where a relationship can lead you.\n\nBut yes if you're talking just the numbers - there are more jobs in Sydney and Melbourne hands down. But there's also many more people (SKILLED people) fighting for those jobs. Personally I felt Brisbane was small enough you could get to know people, who remembered you (because you literally see them all the time).\n\nI would love to give you more specific advice but I have no idea what your goals are or what area you want to go into. I have worked in corporate video / advertising my entire career (which is only 4 years long now, lol) but know a lot of people who work in the local film and TV industry as crew. Why are you even choosing Australia? What do you want to get out of this placement? These will all help me figure out what information will help you the most.",

I've worked in corporate podcast production for the past year or so on the East Coast during my final year of undergrad and enjoyed it immensely. I'd be in a variety of areas of the industry... but my primary interest is integrative nature documentary filmmaking like nat geo or planet earth stuff. I want to establish myself in Australia. I realize the industry is much more vibrant in areas of the US like LA or Atlanta, but I spent a year studying abroad on the Gold Coast and decided Aus is where I want to live. Ultimate goal is to have a small scale prod company that does tourism/nature adverts. Not sure if any of this helps.",

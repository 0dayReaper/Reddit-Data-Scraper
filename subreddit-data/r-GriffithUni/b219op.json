    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI was wondering whether I can access courses (ppt slides and other resources) that I am not enrolled in. For example language courses such as: Russian, Korean. etc. I want to do learn a language as a hobby at my own pace and don't want to study it as part of a degree (and pay for it). If you could help me find a way to access course resources and slides through Griffith website and learning@griffith that would be awesome.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThankyou for you time :)",

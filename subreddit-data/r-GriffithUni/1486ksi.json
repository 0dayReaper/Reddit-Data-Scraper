    "postText": "I\u2019m 19, graduated in 2021 and I only did general math in school but got pretty good grades and generally like maths work. Other story for English where I probably averaged a C+. I\u2019m a very logical person and think this industry would be pretty good for me but not sure if I should go for the easier degree in IT or the harder one, but I think I would probably like computer science more so just wondering how hard are they for someone who doesn\u2019t know programming and not much knowledge in the industry and which one would be the better option? Cheers",

But yeah idk if you were okay with the math in finance you should be fine",

I have colleagues who have done 16-week React boot camps that are great devs and assets to their team, and have rapidly progressed from junior to mid-level positions after only 12-18 months.",

    "postText": "Good Evening,\n\nI was curious if anyone had any input on these two course offerings. I\u2019m looking for peoples personal experiences taking these degrees online. I\u2019m presently working a 2/1 FIFO roster in WA and really wanting to set myself up for the future. \n\nI would love to hear your thoughts on the programs, the pros, the cons. Whether you think it\u2019s manageable to study while working FT. As well as what kind of laptop you\u2019d recommend for tackling either of these degrees. As well as what your thoughts are on the different major options, what you\u2019d recommended.\n\nAny insight/advice would be greatly greatly appreciated.",

However Griffith works best for my situation.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if maybe there\u2019s a Facebook group that\u2019s more active? Just not sure where else would be best to ask!",

A lot of development is going towards designing autonomous machines. I\u2019m hoping that I can get into that side of the industry. Focusing on the software design, testing, and communications side of everything. I would love to move towards a more managerial style role but I know that would be impossible without being understand everything going on at the developmental level. With the introduction of remote controlled machines and other equipment moving to a more computer based approach opposed to hydraulic, I just want to be best prepared for all these changes.",

Although as the adage goes, P's get Degrees, I would seriously consider taking your time learning the principles and foundations of the degree. Putting in the understanding in your first year lends itself to an easier second year and so on. \n\nMany of the courses require much much much more time than others. For example Creative Coding, which is offered in the first year, is much more involved than Professional Practice in IT.   \n\n\nIf you do choose to enrol as an IT student, please let me know as I'd be happy to help you with the course order in which I believe you should take.",

They are against the side closest to uni bar.\n\nAt the other end of the campus near g30 outside the cafe there\u2019s also 3, they sit in a corner near a sink.\n\nBoth get really busy around lunch time. But are usually ok at other times. There\u2019s also some in specific faculty buildings so worth asking your classmates in cse they know of any for your course.",

    "postText": "So I started a Bachelor of IT at qut (around 9 weeks ago) and I wanna do something like cyber security or software engineering (not sure yet).\n\nRecently a friend showed me the major options for IT at Griffith and they looked really good lol, way better than our two CS and IS major options.\n\nNow I haven't exactly got a good look on what units are offered for CS at qut, so I don't exactly know if Qut offers similar units to that of what Griffith's majors offer. \n\nSo now I'm just wondering if I should stay at qut or move to Griffiths for a better chance at emplyoment in a career for SE or cybersecurity.\n\nExtra info: \n\nGriffiths is more closer to me (15 min drive) than Qut (20 min drive) \n\nI have gotten a 4k equity scholarship from qut. I get the second half of it in semester, and I think I should be able to get another one next year.",

            "comment": "no one cares about your minor/major in undergrad as you don't go deep enough and you can get carried by group work and there's  a margin or error of 15% (85%=100%). Choose easy stuff and play in your own time, have a public git and aim to be committing 4 times a week by your last year (even if it's fixing typos in public repos)\n\nParticipate in as many security events as possible (such as capture the flag) as you will learn more applicable security techniques and most importantly make contacts and become visible.\n\nJust power through your undergrad, if you want to specialise do it in your own time (looks better on cv). Apply for to security companies as an intern from 2nd yr on, everyone assumes you know nothing when you graduate. \n\nFrom a course work point of view \"allegedly\" they were written for one uni then the academic got a job at the other and copy pasted. But imo  (career academic for 10+ years) 80% of course work is stale and it's  all heavily biased towards the researchers findings and desired world view.\n\nDm me if you want.",

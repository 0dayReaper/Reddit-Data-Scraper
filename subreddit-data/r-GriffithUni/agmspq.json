    "postText": "Odd request, I know, but I was an international student at Griffith many years ago, and I spent some nights studying on the roof of Lowana residence hall.  I loved the view of the skyline, and I'd like to commission a photo of that skyline from that rooftop.  \n\nIf you have a decent camera and the skills to get a decent photo of it, I'd like to talk with you.  The more experience you have and can show, the more I'm willing to pay.  Likewise if you're a photography student and you need to do this for some kind of project, I'm happy to pay and work with your professor to establish criteria for it.  \n\nThe end product will be printed at 16\"x20\" or some other large size, so it should be a quality enough photo to fit a larger format frame.  I'll work with you on what exact size it'll end up being once we talk rates.  \n\nI'm asking for a Griffith student because you will need access to Lowana res hall.  How you get that access is up to you but I am not out to suborn trespassing - please go through proper channels, don't get yourself in trouble.  I'll answer any questions that might come up. \n\nInterested parties, please post or PM.",

Or if you have an 8am lecture just bring some take-away breakfast from a cafe or just bring the bowl of cereal (I've done that before).\n2. I've had this happen to me a couple of times during the early phases of signing up for courses. As it approaches the beginning of the semester (Or Trimester if you are insane) they tend to sort themselves out. But it might help to e-mail the convenors out of curiosity.  \n\n3. Good luck!",

    "postText": " Hello, \n I was thinking to enroll for this degree. I wish to become an  Audio engineer/producer full time.  I already got a professional formation in Canada , worked in studios, under mentors, my home studio and with different artists.  So my questions are :\n _ How does griffith compares to other places like JMC,SAE,AIM ect... ?\n _ How are the teachers, students like ?\n _ How good are the facilities ? (access,gear,room ect.. )\n I wish to based myself in Australia as the music scene here is too small to make a living out of it.  \nThank you. ",

When i did it was great, miles better than the sae, jmc equivalents (i work alongside some who had done the jmc/sae degrees and they do well to get any work,they are simply clueless). Don't expect to get much work once you have the piece of paper, this industry hates people who have studied in university.\n\nThe degree is also restructuring, its now under the bachelor of music, with music tech as the major. Facilities are great, however you'll need to book studio time 3+ weeks in advance as the studio to student ratio is less than ideal... ",

But without that piece of paper it is impossible to get a visa in a lot of countries. \nI don't mind getting a job at the TV or radio if I can have a stable place to stay and build my home studio once again I'm happy.\nThank again !

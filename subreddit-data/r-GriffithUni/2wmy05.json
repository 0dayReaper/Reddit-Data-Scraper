I've seen people with scooters and skateboards at the Gold Coast campus, but I haven't seen them at Nathan.\nThe campuses aren't so big that you'd be short of time getting from one class to another. Unless you're in first-year health science/biomed/pharmacy, the classes are huge - about 500 people leaving a lecture theatre takes a looong time to move.",

I really just want something to get from where I park my car to the campus. Would I be allowed to bring whatever I end up choosing into the classrooms and such, or do I need to lock it somewhere, not that locking up a scooter is terribly easy =P.",

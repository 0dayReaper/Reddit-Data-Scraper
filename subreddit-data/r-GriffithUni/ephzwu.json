    "postText": "I'm trying to enroll in classes for my first trimester at Griffith in the Bachelor of Dental Health Science program. I was able to enroll in all mandatory classes except for 1040DOH\\_Y1 Pre-clinical Dental Science as ALL the laboratories are full. The lectures and seminars still have some spots, but all the laboratory spots are full at this point in time. What do I do? I need to take this class but I can't enroll. Help pls.",

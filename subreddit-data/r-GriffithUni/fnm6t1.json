    "postText": "Hello everybody I'm an Australian citizen who finished his high school overseas and my high school certificate is commonly accepted in Australia and it is equivalent to the Australian year 12 certificate, I have a GPA or overall score average of 80% so that's equal to an OP of 10, and I would like to apply for a bachelor of IT which needs an ATAR of 65 and An OP of 15 my question is will I get accepted easily to the bachelor degree of IT ? Does Griffith uni accept high school students based on their high school average or do they look at each subject's grade individually?\n\nThank you.",

You can[ view and print this from Application Services](https://www.qtac.edu.au/application-services/application-services) from late December.\n\n***For all other applicants (YOU?),*** *we will allocate a selection rank based on your assessable qualification(s).* Contact us on 1300 467 822 for information about selection ranks.\n\nMaybe give them a call on that\\^ number and ask what \"assessable qualification mean\"?\n\nSource:  [https://www.qtac.edu.au/applying/admission-criteria](https://www.qtac.edu.au/applying/admission-criteria)",

I know the credentials will translate to Australia I\u2019m just not sure what the percentages equate to or if they even bother trying to convert to an ATAR. It is weird being considered a domestic student with high school overseas as the system for international students is different. I will try to call today and post an update!",

If you plan to start there next year then you likely won\u2019t find out if you\u2019re accepted until offers go out the end of this year, which is really annoying. It seems like they wait for final marks from the Aussies to do their rounds of offers, so you\u2019ll be waiting for a while. They did say my daughter could apply for admission for trimester 2 or 3 and then if accepted would defer it to the following year. Unfortunately, if you were given a scholarship that can\u2019t be deferred (but I guess you could apply the next year and get another one).\n\nIn our case my daughter was planning on moving over next August and then working for a while before starting in the 1st trimester. So it would be nice if she knew she was accepted before moving over there.",

Because I just looked it up on qtac website. How can you get accepted online without taking an admission test? Just based on year 12 certificate grades?",

I\u2019m from Canada and they don\u2019t use an admissions test here either. They just have set courses you need to take in high school and they use the overall average percentage from the those top 6 courses (or whatever). So Australia is much like that. Just make sure you meet the course prerequisites for the degree you want and then they will use your marks from the classes for admission.",

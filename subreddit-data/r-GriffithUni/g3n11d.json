    "postText": "Hey everyone, bit of a read but it's worth it. Apologies if you've seen this in 2-3 groups already.\n\nAs you may have seen, UQ Union has put out a statement urging the University to stop the use of ProctorU being used as an online exam invigilator tool.\n\nOn yesterday's weekly COVID-19 update call, it was revealed to the SRC that the University is considering this software for examinations, should the current CHO orders remain in place.\n\nIt was only after this call I began to learn more about ProctorU.\n\nThe software is already in use for the digital/online campus. However, given that most if not all of on-campus students will be using this for the first time, you ought to know how this works, and if you're comfortable with using it.\n\nAs the SRC Board Chair, I know the board wants to do what it can to advocate for you. However, I am personally concerned with the software for a number of reasons and wanted to know your thoughts.\n\nEssentially, ProctorU is online invigilator software. By using this software, you will be required to provide photographic identification on camera (which admittedly, could just be a student ID), which will scan and store your biometric data for authentication purposes. ProctorU will then continue to monitor your camera, microphone, screen and keystrokes. It claims to monitor academic integrity by using AI to monitor eye-movements on screen, and alert invigilators of suspicious activity.\n\nAccording to their privacy policy, this data will be retained and stored by the company, and in the event of \u2018bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganisation or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction.\u2019\n\nNow, of course maintaining academic integrity is a key concern of the University and of the SRC. However, many would agree that storing and commodifying your data is a line most do not want to cross.\n\nI am aware of the argument that goes, \"But people waive their privacy away on a daily basis by not reading Ts&amp;Cs, using Google, using smartphones with Face ID, using government services, etc etc. However, in this instance, we may not have much of a choice. Most of us can't finish our courses if we can't finish our exams, so why should we be forced into handing over our biometric data to be sold off should this company go belly-up?\n\nThe Privacy Policy states that data will be retained \"for as long as necessary to perform the Services described in this Policy, as long as necessary for us to perform any contract with you or your institution, or as long as needed to comply with our legal obligations.\"\n\nI see this as vague and indefinite unless IT/Law scholars can explain otherwise.\n\nFurther, a previous SRC petition was taken down and the reasons given to us were because the petition platform was based on a server outside of Australia. Why is it then, that we could be made to provide our biometric data to a company with servers based in the USA?\n\nLet us know what you think in the comments so we can discuss the next steps ahead at the SRC Board Meeting this week.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/1116681258431725/permalink/2428321853934319/",

I agree with most of the things you\u2019ve said, I\u2019m just wondering what you think the alternative would be? They obviously need some kind of monitoring, is there another company you\u2019re suggesting?",

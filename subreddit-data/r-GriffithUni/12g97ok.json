    "postText": "Hellooo! I'm currently studying a dual degree for biomed and science at UQ and while it is rewarding it is very content heavy and quite competitive. As I am also a New Zealand citizen, I am required to pay my fees from my own pockets which is a little difficult to do on a minimum wage job. Biomed fees at Griffith and QUT seem to be lower (and they also offer a greater range of  scholarships for financial assistance). I was also considering studying at one of the unis in auckland as I would be able to qualify for student loans. If anyone has any insight/advice they would like to share on completing biomed at Griffith or QUT or even Auckland unis it would be much appreciated thank youuu!!!",

            "comment": "Griffith I like to recommend for health degrees over UQ even though UQ is rated higher because of the fact that griffith\u2019s Gold Coast campus is basically the \u201chealth campus\u201d it has integrated workings with the hospitals and you get way more exposure to future work environments than normal uni health degrees \n\nThe downside is having to get to or pay to live on the Gold Coast",

Third in Australia for Dentistry. Griffith is the way to go for health in Australia. I know someone who was in Sydney who specifically decided to go to learn at Griffith for dentistry.",

If somebody were to stay overnight on campus you don't want to get up at 8am the next day and pay then go back to uni - what im trying to avoid. any help please. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThankyou",

            "comment": "Closest free parking is the stretch of University Road from where the DTMR depot / bus stops / cemetary entrance to just before the Nathan Campus sign &amp; the roundabout that leads to the East Carpark. It does take a fair while to walk (about 15-20 min from N50. Many students park here and will use the intercampus shuttle to save time, but as with parking issues at Nathan campus already, it fills up quick (as in, all the parking spots are gone by 9am).\n\nUnsure about overnight though",

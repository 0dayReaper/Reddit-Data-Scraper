    "postText": "Hi, I am a Canadian student and just got my offer for the bachelor of pharmacy program. \n\nDue to the border restrictions, the first year courses will have to be taken online. I  would really prefer to be there for the labs for better learning experiences. I asked if I can defer my admission to next year but that means I may have to lose my scholarship. My tuition with the scholarship is $24750 and $33000 without the scholarship per year.\n\nHow is your experience with the program? Do you think it is a bad idea to take courses online? Did you have hard time finding an intern position after your final year?\n\nThanks a lot for the help!",

I did 3rd year subjects online this year and they weren't the worst, in fact I found being able to study from home helped, and I had the option to go to the library to study as well. \n\nNext year, labs and workshops will be face to face but lectures will be online so if you have the option to travel you definitely should. (you'll most likely have to quarantine when you arrive though, which is $200/day right now)\n\nOnline lectures aren't so bad, as you still get to interact with the lecturers and they're always open to meet either face to face or via video to answer any questions. And if you can travel and be able to do labs and workshops in person, it's a good deal. I highly recommend keeping the scholarship unless you don't mind forking $10000 extra per year.",

I guess the reason why I feel unsure is because if I come from computer science background and lack hands on experience in lab and the online delivery may not provide the best learning experience for me. I feel so conflicted ..",

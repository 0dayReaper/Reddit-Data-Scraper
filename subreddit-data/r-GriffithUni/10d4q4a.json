            "comment": "I lived there a little while ago. They tried to take my bond and claimed that I had to pay for carpet cleaning and professional cleaning after living there for a few months.   When I received the room, it was disgusting, the mirror in the bathroom was smashed, and the communal areas were disgusting. \n\nWhen you move in, take heaps of photos of the place, complete an entry conditions report for rooming accommodation and make sure they lodge your bond. Don\u2019t forget, you just have to return it the room in the condition that it was in when you moved in, minus fair wear and tear. The second you hand over the keys, claim your bond back. I would recommend having a look at the QSTARS website. [qstars.org.au](https://qstars.org.au)",

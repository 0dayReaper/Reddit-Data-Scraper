    "postText": "Hey everyone. Im an international student from the USA applying to the bsc medical science and doctor of medicine provisional pathway at Griffith and its possible that a conditional offer may arrive for me soon. However, even if a conditional offer arrives, I cannot actually secure my place in the program until I meet the conditions (have to submit my final high school transcript at the end of June along with my AP scores). However, this program fills very quickly and sending my AP scores to griffith may take weeks - in fact, the scores for this years results dont even come out until July 13, meaning it may take until early august for griffith to receive my AP scores. I dont expect seats to remain for international students in august. Any advice for me?",

They sent me an email telling me the spaces are full. I am really worried because this is my top choice and may not be able to secure it.",

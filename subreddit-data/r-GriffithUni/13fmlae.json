    "postText": "Hey, international student here. A bachelors degree for Griffith that I'm applying for requires that \"applicants must not have attempted tertiary studies at diploma level or higher\".\n\nIn the US, we have some classes called \"dual enrollment.\" It basically means we can take an online class taught by a university while we are IN high school. But technically its a university level class, even though it shows up on my high school transcript. Does this disqualify me from applying to that Griffith degree?",

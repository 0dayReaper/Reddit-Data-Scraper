    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI have just secured an offer for the Bachelor of Dental Health Science course for the 2023 intake. Whilst it is very exciting, I will be moving from interstate (Melbourne). Is there any advice/feedback for this course as well as suggestions for on-campus vs. off-campus accommodation at Gold Coast? Is off-campus accomodation provided by the university just as safe as living on campus? Also any feedback on course faculty?\n\nThanks :)",

            "comment": "The dental facilities at the GC campus have been upgraded in a new building just a few years ago, where there is also a public dental clinic.  I am not in dentistry, but work on the same floor as the dental academics, and they seem like a very polite, courteous, friendly bunch.\n\nThe GC as a whole is generally safe.  There are places with larger numbers of homeless people and addiction, but I have almost never felt unsafe in the 20ish years I've been here.  You learn to stay away from the places like Surfers Paradise where the aggressive, bourbon-charged bogans congregate looking for fights on the weekend.  Apart from that, living anywhere you like is OK.\n\nOne suggestion I do have though - if you can find accommodation on the tram-line, that make getting to/from the Uni much easier.  Parking is limited, expensive, and almost all of the parking is on the opposite side of campus from the G40 Health Building where Dentistry and the Dental Clinic are situated.  It's a 15 minute walk from one side of campus to the other.  The tram stops 5 minutes walk from the G40 Health Building, with at least two cafes en route!\n\nThe GC might be a bit of a culture shock coming from Melbourne.  Think more utes, more aggro, more plastic faces/bodies, but you can choose a friendship group that suits you best, which is one of the best things about going to Uni.",

It's very suburban, but as long as you have a car, it won't be a problem.  About 10-15 minutes driver to the Uni campus.  Ashmore is well-serviced by supermarkets, other shops, schools, etc., if that's important.  Ashmore is not too far from the beach either, and is fairly central to the rest of the coast.  You'll only be a few minutes drive from the tramline too.",

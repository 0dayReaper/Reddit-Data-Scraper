That if you set off the smoke alarm for you pay nearly a thousand.\n\nNo guarantees you'll get along with your housemates. \n\nNot ideal for study due to noise. \n\nNo air-conditioning from memory. May have changed\n\nNot ideally located near shops\n\nGood to spend 6 months meeting people if you're new to GC and socialising is high on your list of interests.\n\nWould be good to know if they improved anything since I was there last but its just a profit making village.",

I was excited at first of the idea of being on campus but seems as though the only plus side is the social aspect, as the OP noted. \n\nWith the noise issue you noted, did you find that more so on the weekends or constantly an issue? \n\nWhen it comes to the socializing part, were there events or things that made it easy to meet people, or just more so the community that forms with being in residence together?",

I just got accepted to Griffith for the Bachelor of Laws in July so scrambling to figure out housing. Might have to bite the bullet and do the village for a semester like you said, and then move out. If noise is that bad I\u2019ll probably just do all my studying at the library and only be at housing to relax/sleep. \nThanks for all your info, I appreciate it a ton!",

    "postText": "hi! international that's deciding between QUT and Griffith. :)\n\nI applied for both QUT and Griffith's animation courses and thought I would've made up my mind about which university I really wanted to go to by now but I haven't.\n\nI understand that QUT focuses more on 3D and Griffith seems more 2D based and I have a preference to 2D but I enjoy doing 3D as well. I've been told constantly and have seen a little bit of how competitive the 2D market is though so I worry that I might not be able to get much out of Griffith. If anyone has any opinions on that please let me know!\n\nI'd also like to ask what the course, community, people, and management is like? And just your general view/experience of the school or Brisbane itself would be appreciated :)\n\n\\[Background stuff - I'm a 2D generalist mainly with passable experience in 3D. I'd definitely say that I'm able to do a bunch of things already so my main reason for wanting to go to uni overseas is for the connections and experience since my country's art industry is very limiting.\\]\n\nThanks!!",

            "comment": "QUT - I hate to be a pessimist but especially with a creative degree it will pay dividends to work in QUT's newer facilities and with relevant faculty. \n\nCurrently studying with Griffith and the general consensus between friends and myself is that they care more about volume through and tuition fees accrued rather than providing an actual quality education. Mind you, I am studying a degree opposite side of the spectrum to you, but I've also completed a creative degree and know the aforementioned sentiment matters 1000x more in creative degrees. \n\nAt the end of the day, both will give you the piece of paper. But, if you're looking for a quality education, choose QUT. Having used their creative facilities many times and from reports of friends, they will be more worth your more than griffith.",

            "comment": "I have experience with the animation programs in both schools: as a student and as a teacher. The programs are very similar: similar classes and same teaching style.  I don\u2019t agree that Griffith doesn\u2019t care about quality education. Griffith Film School is famous for its quality. However, it really depends on who you get as a teacher, and unfortunately sessional tutors tend to change every couple of years, and you never know who you might get. The senior lecturers are all knowledgeable and experienced in both schools.\nQUT\u2019s animation program is a bit more flexible with a big choice of electives from other programs. Griffith\u2019s program is more focused, especially if you choose animation as your major. It\u2019s very well structured.\nYou will get a chance to take 3D classes at both schools (modeling, sculpting, texturing, etc).\nQUT\u2019s Kelvin Grove campus is more modern and has better facilities. Griffith\u2019s Southbank Campus is very small and doesn\u2019t even have it\u2019s own cafe. There are shops and cafes around though. And you still get access to all the necessary equipment: good PCs, etc.\nQUT has a free shuttle bus to the city. Griffith hosts most of its events at its Nathan campus and there is no shuttle from Southbank.\nGriffith Film School is a bit more fun, artsy and inclusive. QUT has more international students (much much more). Griffith Film School has great industry connections and internship opportunities.\nOverall, if you want to be an animator, probably go with Griffith. For the overall student experience and a chance to try other interesting things apart from animation - consider QUT.",

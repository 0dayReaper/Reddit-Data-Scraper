I thought tri 3 supposed to be used to make studying easier but it seems ridiculous at this point",

            "comment": "I think the intensives in T3 are very convenient and help reduce work load for next year. For example, instead of doing 4 classes in the first trimester of 2019, I can do one of my electives as an intensive over 3 weeks in November, and then have some free time in 2019.\nIt works well with some practical subjects. And Griffith often offers some interesting one-off classes in T3 that are not normally available at other time. ",

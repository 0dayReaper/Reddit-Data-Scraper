    "postText": "So my weekly timetable says I have 1022ENG from 9am-11:50am, however it shows that it's in 3 different rooms, it seems to be only 1022ENG. Is this just because theirs multiple lecture halls for the class?",

The following week, so next week, it has the same thing, it says I have multiple rooms in, 0.17, 0.16 and 0.14, but also next week I have a PASS going through it. However its online so I'm not going to attend, just going to watch the recording.  also tried sending you a screen shot in your DMs however I couldn't for some reason",

If confused, definitely email your course coordinator. Ideally PASS shouldn't go through a lecture or tutorial because that then means you're missing content",

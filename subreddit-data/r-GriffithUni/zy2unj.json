    "postText": "So I want to study law as a mature age student but am finding it confusing looking at the class times online while I research. I only see one option for each class. I thought I\u2019d have multiple choices and some would be online or in the evenings too. Some even say only in Brisbane but I am at the Gold Coast. What am I missing?",

            "comment": "There is an online-only option for the JD, but there doesn't seem to be a fully online Bachelor of Laws (LLB) option.   \nThe options and campus are listed in the summary box on each degree page.   \nYou can choose the location of the degree or the entirely online option when you apply or enrol.  If you have not yet applied or enrolled then this is why you can't see this.  You can also change once enrolled.\n\nNote - the number of class options are dependent on number of students. Law tends to be smaller than the likes of first year science or arts.",

    "postText": "Hi! \nI\u2019m moving to gold coast from interstate this July to study and was wondering if anyone could give me an idea on what the student village in gold coast is like? Is it worth staying there in regard to making friends and the quality of the rooms? How many students does it hold (am I likely to get a place if I do decide i want to stay there?) Any insight would be so helpful! Thanks",

Can\u2019t speak to the cost, however most of them are setup ad 5 students to a unit each with their own bedroom, sharing communal areas. \nI do believe there is a lot that the village offers in terms of activities so if you\u2019re new and looking to make friends it\u2019s probably a good place to start. Most people I know, started in the village and moved out with the group to a better house share situation. \nHope this helps",

Either flat or dormitory style depending on your age, level of study etc. lots of different activities throughout the year as well. You\u2019ll meet people and make friends for sure.",

Would this be causing this issue or would be something else. And can I respond to the email they sent or will it just tell me it\u2019s an automatic reply email?",

Cause I was having trouble with that earlier this year, turns out they rerouted that link for staff access or something. So the only way to get in is going through the griffith website through the learning at griffith tab. But if that doesn't doesn't work then definitely call student services.",

I select it and put my information in, then it takes me to the Griffith page and says \u201caccess denied\u201d. Though I tried to log into my Griffth a few months back and it said access denied then too. \n\nI\u2019ll try the other link but if no avail, I\u2019ll call student services",

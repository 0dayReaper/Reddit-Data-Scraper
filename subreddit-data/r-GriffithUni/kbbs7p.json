The criminology subjects are great, very interesting and there is a wide range of electives to choose from.",

I would recommend doing the first year full time and getting used to it and then getting a job. This will also depend on how well you can time manage/if you need a job. Hope this helps, feel free to shoot me a DM if you like :)",

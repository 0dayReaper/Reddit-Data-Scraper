    "postText": "I just got accepted into UQ and Griffith for a Masters of Public Health. My end goal is hopefully medicine but I'm pretty sure my GAMSAT score isn't going to be great, so I thought I would do this in the mean time. My biomed bachelors from UQ, hasn't done much for me career wise (currently working at a dead end pathology job). \n\nAnyways, I was wondering what Uni has a better program? Specifically for placements and networking. I live in the Gold Coast too so the commute to the Herston campus for UQ is super long, so wondering if it would be worth it.  Just want to see what others think..",

            "comment": "Hii. I don't think I can be of much help but I had a question about ur bachelors? I'm currently doing my bachelors in biomed and science at UQ and am curious what ur thoughts are on completing biomed at other unis like Griffith or QUT and why u didn't chose to do ur undergrad there? I initially picked UQ thinking that I would have a higher employability chance graduating from a research focused uni but now I'm not so sure (especially considering places like QUT have integrated work placement units). Any help would be appreciated thank u!!",

                    "comment": "I picked UQ with the same idea in mind and that UQ had a better world ranking in life sciences (not that it really mattered anyways). I originally attended Griffith gold coast for a semester on exchange from Canada, I did feel like UQ had better class structure and lecturers (but I again I was only there for a semester) . My big regret during my undergrad was not engaging more and building up a network, I was working 30hr weeks on top of uni, so a lot of my study was online with a few days a week at uni (I wasn't very social with people in the sciences). I do wish there was some kind of industry placement for people who didn't want to have a research heavy career. With that being said, I think an honors year gives you that research experience a lot of roles are looking for. I met with a couple of professors about honours but I couldn't really find a project that spoke to me, so I thought I'd try something new but still healthcare related, hence the public health masters.\n\nOverall, I think employers are looking for industry experience over anything else, ie where you get your degree from. So placement or honors would be very valuable and something I wish I did. Plus also growing a network within the field as well.",

That is very impressive to have been working full time on top of managing a content heavy degree. If you could go back and do it again would u have chosen to enrol in a lower ranked uni so that the content was less theory based and more balanced with practicals (apparently uq is known for its heavy theory) which would've perhaps allowed u more room to network and enroll for placements? \nAlso do u think there's much of a difference with consideration for jobs for a biomed graduate versus someone with a science degree majored in biomed? \nAnd regarding ur masters, what sorts of jobs will u be able to do with public health and biomed- surely it's not lab based and more on the management side? \nIndustry networking does seem to be important - I feel u have to really jump out of ur comfort zone and join clubs to do that as a lot of students in labs and tutorials and things tend to kind of stick to their own schedules rather than socialise outside of class to explore these things if that makes sense - might be a prestiged uni thing or just an Australian thing lmao. \n\nOne last question- do u personally think it would make sense to study business conjoint with biomed rather than biomed and science for someone who is interested in the research industry but not so much the hands on lab work. \nThis semester has really had me thinking about wether or not biomed is something I want to continue pursuing as biomed at uq is integrated with a lot more maths and less physiology than i would've liked. Currently thinking of switching to a New Zealand uni so that the study-work-life balance is attainable lmao.",

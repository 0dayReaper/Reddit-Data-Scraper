It\u2019s not easy to get a good GPA and lots of students drop out or change their degree to IT or another. \n\nBut, I like studying CS and I think it was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve made. Lots of opportunities with a CS degree - software engineering, data science, AI, etc. \n\nAlso, you can still finish your study a little less than 3yrs, which I\u2019m finishing my degree in 2yr and 1 trimester. \n\nHope this helps!",

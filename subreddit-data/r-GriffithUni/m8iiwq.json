    "postText": "I've seen the GCE A level requirements for the course I want to study for undergraduates which is a level 6 or also counted as grades C,D,D. I know the requirements are low, but some people said that it's a competitive uni to get into. So I'm actually really confused if it's super hard or relatively easy to get admission to University of Griffith Australia.",

Whilst I was at MG campus, which is older and lacking facilities, I actually loved it for that. It was very small and close knit with it more being about the students and the learning than anything else. I went to GC campus once and hated it. In saying that a new psych department is being established at Nathan so who knows what it will be like then. \nThe first three years is essentially just theory/learning/assessments. Honours is the same with the added observational placement and a thesis, Masters is the best, doing prac in the clinic and having my own client base.",

If you want to go the PhD route, go to UQ. \n\nAs mentioned above, you don't really learn how to be a \"psychologist\" until you hit your masters. I'm only putting this here because a surprising number of students are confused when they have to learn a significant amount of statistics.\n\nWhich requires you to maintain a GPA of 5.75 for 3 years to get into honours where you'll get to do a 40hr placement amongst coursework and a 10k word thesis.\nThis is for Griffith anyways.",

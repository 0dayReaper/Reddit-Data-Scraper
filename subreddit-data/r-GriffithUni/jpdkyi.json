If you contact admissions they can give you the names of bridging courses they accept (you don't want to waste your money doing one they don't take, after all).\n \nTo my recollection they ran their own bridging courses for a few years (GC campus at least) but I haven't heard of them in a while, so I don't think it's still going.",

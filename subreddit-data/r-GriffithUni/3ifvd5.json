    "postText": "Hello Gold coast students. I study at Nathan but have to go down to the Goldie every few weeks for one of my subjects. I'm cheap so I'm not paying for a parking permit! When I went down at the beginning of the semester I parked at Napper Rd which was way too far to walk, but i did anyway. \n\nAre there any secret 'streets' closer to the uni for free parking? Or would it be easier to park somewhere and get a bus or the tram up to the uni. \n\nThanks :) Oh yeah, who got that email about the health alert about measles. Bloody UQ lol",

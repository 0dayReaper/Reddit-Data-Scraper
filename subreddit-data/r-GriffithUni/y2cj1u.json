    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019m an international student that is interested in studying at GFS for animation. I\u2019m a little worried about my portfolio, I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to pass. I was wondering if any current students or graduates could share their admissions portfolio with me, so I can gauge my skills ig, it would be very helpful. If anyone has the time and could asses my portfolio, it would be even more appreciated. Thank you :))",

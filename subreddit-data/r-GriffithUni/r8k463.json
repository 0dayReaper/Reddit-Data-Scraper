    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI am an international student from Canada and recently I was given an offer for Griffith University to their pharmacy program after being rejected from their dentistry program. As a result I have not taken a close consideration into the school's pharmacy program and had so questions hopefully some of you could help me answer:\n\nHow did you find courses were like in the first 2 years of school?\n\nHow easy would the transition be to practice in Canada after the 4 years?\n\nCould I defer my offer? And if I did what is the process like?\n\nWhat is the environment like in Golden Coast?*\n\nMuch if a lesser question but as a person of African descent, what kind of support systems are there in place by the school for multiculturalism and diversity?\n\nIf anyone would be willing to answer these questions, I would very much appreciate your time.\n\n*When I say \"environment\" I really mean the nature. Is it that crazy?",

            "comment": "Hello fellow Canadian here. I'm in third year of that program.\n\nHonestly the first 2 years I found relatively easy if you stay attentive in class and do most of the work/readings. \n\nFrom my reading, it not very easy to come back and have your degree recognized, as this is a Bachelor program and canada want pharmacist to have done masters degree. Therefore most likely you'd have to do about a 6 month abridging program. Then write 3 exams which must completed in order and are offered 3 times a year. After that I believe their is another unpaid internship. Then you can become licensed to practice back in canada. \n\nIn my opinion it's probably easier to get permanent residency in Australia and work here. As I believe it's only a paid internship for a year then an exam and you're done and ready to go.\n\nFeel free to correct me if I'm wrong on any thing.",

    "postText": "Hi, am moving to KCBC college next month, would like to know if riding a bike on campus is possible. \n\n1. Can I keep a bike living on the residential colleges? \n\n2. Is there restriction on bicycles when commuting inside campus? E.g. can I ride on the Ring Road?\n\nThanks in advance!!",

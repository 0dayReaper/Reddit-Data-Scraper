    "postText": "I introduced myself to a girl in COFFEE MAJOR G33 the other day. I saw her sitting alone and I walked up to her. It felt like love at first sight.\n\nI said my name and we started talking about our majors and that typical stuff. but I couldn't think of how to keep the conversation going at one point. I pulled out my phone and asked if she wanted to see my vegetable garden from my hometown. She nodded and I started going through pics. I started it a few years ago and was really proud of my basil and tomatoes especially. I think she was really interested and I thought she really liked me and she was pretty too so i asked her \"Do you want to date?\" and she said \"ummm no im sorry.\" I felt really awkward so I just apologized and said bye.\n\nThis has kinda shattered my confidence and I can't stop thinking about it.\n\nHas anyone else had their confidence shattered at the Griffith uni's Gold Coast campus in a similar manner?",

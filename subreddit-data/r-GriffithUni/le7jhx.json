    "postText": "I sent an email to Griffith regarding entrance into medicine and they responded by saying that I needed \"completion of a Bachelor degree or other\u00a0key degree achieving an overall\u00a0GPA\u00a0of 5.0 or above on a 7-point scale calculated using the\u00a0GEMSAS\u00a0SCHEMA\". Afterwards I asked them if they accepted bachelor degrees from NZ but they havent responded yet. Please let me know if they will accept a bachelors degree from NZ (University of Auckland). Any help will be highly appreciated :)))).",

But this is very unlikely.",

    "postText": "okay so i'm in my first year of a bachelor of arts at griffith and i'm not doing great with my grades because of some personal issues getting in the way a bit. i want to figure out if i'm going to pass or not based on my grades but i have no idea how the grading system works. \n\ni've looked it up and seen the explanation of it but somehow it's not making much sense to me, probably because i'd got used to a different grading system before griffith and now it's not sinking into my brain. \n\ncan someone please explain to me how i can keep track of how i'm going with my individual assessment marks as i get them?",

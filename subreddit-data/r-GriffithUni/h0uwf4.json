    "postText": "Hey Everyone,\n\nJust had a question regarding the Honours program for the Bachelor of Arts. So if there are any alumni that would be awesome. The information I have been given is:\n\n\n'To apply for the Honours program that corresponds with your Bachelor degree, you\u2019ll need to think of a project idea, find a supervisor, and complete the application process.'\n\n\nIt's just a very broad piece of information, so I guess my question is how extensive does the 'project' need to be? I completed a double major in Creative Writing &amp; Screen Studies, so I was thinking of doing a collection of 3 - 4 Short Stories. That will hopefully lead into a full length novel. Am I seemingly on the right track? \n\nAnd, if anyone can shed light on where exactly I could further aim these questions? Or a place to check out older honours projects.\n\nThanks so much!",

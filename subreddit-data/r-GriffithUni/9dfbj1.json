    "postText": "Hey gang, I've finally jumped on board after fucking around for 3 years after high school to get into study. \n\nFew things I've been wondering, and as course planners don't take phone calls and I haven't moved to Brisbane yet. Firstly course load; like I said 3 years out of highschool so no doubt I've lost a few brain cells and arn't really sure how many subjects I should take initially to get back in the groove of studying and writing reports. I'll be working as well to pay rent and such, hoping to score 20 or 30 hours somewhere. Could I pull off 3 subjects a trimester? And is 3 good to start with or should I look at doing 2 until I get into it again like I said. I'll be looking for work and trying to land interviews a week before orientation as that's the earliest I can be in Brisbane. It's a 3 year course I'm studying, but is it only a 3 year course if I'm doing 4 courses over two trimesters a year? \n\nSecondly are the any resources that can help me get into the mind space of studying, writing essays and the such about? The past three years have been drowned in piss so no doubt I'm going to need to polish up on a few things. \n\nMight leave my other questions below when I remember them.",

It took me 6 years to figure out the right path for me!\n\nAs for your question, it all really depends what you're studying and how \"academic\" you are. I find 3 subjects per semester perfectly manageable while working \\~20 hours a week.\n\nYour degree schedule will (usually) have 8 subjects per year: 4 each in Tri 1 &amp; 2. If you can manage to do 3 subjects in trimester 1 and 2, then take the remaining 2 subjects in Tri 3, you'll spread out the workload without extending the time it takes to do your degree. Obviously if you don't complete 8 subjects per year though your degree will take longer than 3 years. Depending on the degree, you might be better off taking two \"introductory\" courses in Tri 3, and then taking 3 subjects in Tri 1 next year. Can I ask what you're studying?\n\nAs a note: taking less than 3 subjects in either of the \"main\" trimesters (1&amp;2) will mean you won't be considered a full time student and won't be able to access the perks (i.e. concession fares on public transport, cheap movie tickets, centrelink etc.)",

I like to think I'm academic, always did well in my poxy country school but I don't know if I'm just stroking my ego half the time as when it came to OP I wasn't too crash hot. I'm starting a bachelor of business, major in marketing is the plan at this point. Yea spreading it out sounds like the plan I suppose - a 12 week holiday is a bit long for me to be sitting around only working 20 or so hours. Are these introductory courses specific to the bachelor? I've had the enrolment tab open for the past two days mulling it over and haven't spotted anything that rings a bell. Yea I guess I'll get a better feel for it once I've done a trimester, 4 subjects just sounds like a lot at this point. Full time on the Griffith site says 4 subjects - mutual friends get away with less and still claim austudy some how, might have to look into it. ",

                            "comment": "Grades and OP don't necessarily = academic so I think you're fine!  \nYou're right, Griffith classes full time load as 4 per trimester but 3 is also considered \"full time\" for everything like centrelink etc. so that's how your friends do it. I'm doing 4 this trimester and working a lot. I'll be honest, it's tough.\n\nAs for easier courses, anything with \"introduction\" in the name is always good, but any course code that starts with a 1 should be fine, most lecturers will ask who's new at the start of the first lecture and get you sorted anyway!\n\nTrimester 3 does kinda suck for the \"uni life\" aspect, so don't let that get you down. Some cafes close early or don't open at all and it's pretty quiet. Luckily that means you'll definitely get a good park and a seat at the library though so I guess it works out ;)\n\nGood luck OP!",

These will get filtered out via the uni intranet firewall. \n\nFind out through the library search how to get your student copy of Office 365. You basically get Microsoft Office for free during your degree. \n\nDon\u2019t hesitate to ask for help; Lecturers and Tutors don\u2019t mind. \n\nIf you\u2019re getting any HECS help loan, also apply for the SSAF (Student Services and Amenities Fee) - this pays for stuff like student administration etc. \n\n*If you want to, you can apply for the Student Start Up Loan (via Centrelink): You receive $1,055 for both Trimester 1 &amp; 2 ($2,110 per year) to pay for textbooks (especially when textbooks average around $150 each). There are also Textbook Exchanges where you can buy textbooks cheaper (used) and via the Textbook Exchange pages on Facebook. \n\nHave a look at the library search when you\u2019ve searched for something; on the left pane you can select options that filter out anything not peer reviewed, academic, etc. \n\nA 1,500 word essay can be done over night; but not recommended. Finding the time to find relevant sources and read through them is what takes the longest. Even harder when second year assignments are about 2,500 - 3,000 words minimum in length.\n\nLastly: Make a note due dates for assessments. \n\n**They are closer than you think**.\n\nTips from a second year student.

    "postText": "So I transferred from a single Bachelor of IT to a dual of that degree and the Bachelor of Criminology. I got the approval email yesterday. I have a few questions though:\n\n1. How long does it take for myGriffith to update the program? I kinda need to redo my enrolment before tri 1 next year?\n\n2. Regarding credit points, do they only transfer ones from the courses that you have already done or  just the courses from the degree? Does this mean I don't have to do all courses required to graduate and can just go my own way about it?\n\nPlease help and thank you :)",

    "postText": "Hi all, My name is Dylan and I help to run a technology club for young people with Asperger's and High Functioning Autism called The Lab. We started a couple of years ago in Melbourne, and are now in 15 locations around the country and providing a great service working with hundreds of kids a week. We are currently looking for mentors for the Lab in Brisbane. Key to what we do is having good mentors - people who can look at a young person's strengths and interests and lead them down a productive path. Many of our current mentors have been found through posts like this on Reddit. The sessions are 2 hours, Mondays and Wednesdays (4:30pm-6:30pm) or possibly on Saturdays. The pay is decent. The rewards are immense. It is an ideal position for an IT or gaming professional who is looking to give a little back. Please let me know if you have any questions - you can ask here or email through the lab website http://thelab.org.au/jobs. dylanhb@gmail.com Thanks in advance!",

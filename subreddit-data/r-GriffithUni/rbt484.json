Does Griffith have another day where more class times are released and I can change this or do I need to put it up with it ? \n\nThanks !!",

If it's genuinely an issue then your best bet is to email the course conveners and ask if anything can be done for you!",

If you aren't able to resolve this before class starts, I would keep watching the enrolment for the class during the first week and more often or not you will see the class you want will become available.",

            "comment": "I graduated with the Bachelor of Animation, and I am still there at Griffith Film School doing past-graduate studies. I honestly believe that Griffith has the best animation program in Australia, especially for 2D animation. It\u2019s well structured and more focused than the program at QUT, for example, where there is more flexibility and cross-overs with other streams. GFS has very good industry connections and internship agreements with local studios. This is important, because animation industry is incredibly competitive. Many GFS graduates get recruited by studios like Ludo, Like a Photon, Pixel Zoo, etc. I also love the diversity and inclusion at GFS. Overall, it\u2019s a great place to study. No regrets.",

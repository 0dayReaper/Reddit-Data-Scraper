    "postText": "I am an international student opting to study at Griffith. I had applied for feb intake but was asked to defer. Today when i talked with my consultant they said Griffith won\u2019t accept my admission application for masters as i have almost 2 years gap post graduation. I have done some short internships (4m and 2m) \ni was told Griffith only accepts tax paying (employed) applicants. what are my chances to get an admission at griffith for master of global development? im quite disheartened cause of the conversation i had with my consultant.",

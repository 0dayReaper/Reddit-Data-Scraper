They are there to help! \n\n\nYou can also request a call from a [Student Mentor](https://www.griffith.edu.au/student-mentoring/mentoring-programs/back-on-academic-track) We can talk you through some study tips and let you know of some resources available to you that could be beneficial. \n\n\nNo one wants you excluded and there are things in place to ensure this doesn't happen!",

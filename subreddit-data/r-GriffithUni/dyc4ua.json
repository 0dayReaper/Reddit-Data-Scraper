    "postText": "Hey, all! I just graduated out of high school last Friday, with me and my mates being the last OP students to graduate (the end of an era)! I am pretty confident about my grades and I do hope I'll be able to just get the right OP to get into the course that I want to study, which is the Bachelor of Criminology and Criminal Justice.\n\nHowever, I would like to prepare for the worst, in case I don't get the OP requirements...I've spoken to a lot of people and they've said that there are other ways to enter into Uni, but they didn't really elaborate on it. I was hoping that since Griffith University is my preferred place to study, and that I was fortunate enough to even find r/GriffithUni, would I be able to get some insight with other ways to get into my preferred course?",

If I was you, your best bet is to come into Student Admin, and ask \"for  the booklet that has all the different degrees\" cause in that booklet, each degree has its own info and pathways into that course.\n\nIf you live near Nathan, visit the admin centre. They're super friendly and will help you out. If you have any issues, send me a message. I work casual for the uni re stuff like this although I haven't been taught in all details re pathways yet so whilst I can't totally help you, I can somewhat assists for something thing. But yeah, visiting admin is a good idea cause they will know exactly what I'm talking about re the booklet.",

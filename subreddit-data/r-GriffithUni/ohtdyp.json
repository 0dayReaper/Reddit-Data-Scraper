    "postText": "I'm planning on moving to Gold coast next year to study and am really considering looking at the Griffith student accom. Thought this might be a good idea as I literally don't know a soul in QLD and college/student accom seems like a great way to make friends. Most of my mates all went to college when they were 18/19 and have left by now so obviously i feel like I'm going to be way older than most people ( turning 22 early next year). I love socialising and am very sporty but also a bit over the rowdy party scene. In terms of student accomodation where would you recommend for a slightly older age demographic ?",

If your moving to GC it might be worth doing your first year in student accommodation and once you make friends you might end up getting a place together off campus.",

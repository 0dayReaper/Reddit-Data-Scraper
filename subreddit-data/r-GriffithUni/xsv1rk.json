    "postText": "Hey everyone\ud83d\ude42, I am looking for participants to complete an anonymous 15 minute online survey for my Psychology Honours dissertation exploring communication between students and academic staff in tertiary education. The study looks at communication strategies and feelings of injustice felt by both online and on-campus university students. If you are a currently enrolled online university student in Australia, I would highly appreciate your participation. Participants can elect to enter a prize draw to win 1 of 2 $50 gift vouchers! On-campus students are also welcome to answer, however recruitment is currently focused online.\nAdditional information on the study and how to participate can be found by clicking on the following link: (which will direct you to the questionnaire)\nhttps://qsurvey.qut.edu.au/jfe/form/SV_9HqFbUT7f0zEj6S",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I previously graduated with a Bachelor of Business at uni last year, and am now undertaking a Bachelor of Engineering already underway. I got pretty average grades for business, but alot better in engineering, when I check my academic transcript, both GPAs are combined. I was wondering if it is possible to separate my degrees on two transcripts?or wipe the business ones? And how I could go about doing this?",

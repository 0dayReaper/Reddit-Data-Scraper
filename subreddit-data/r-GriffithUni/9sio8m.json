    "postText": "My mark for one of my final exams hasn\u2019t been released yet, but under the course profile \u2018grade section\u2019 is says \u2018SUP\u2019 where the grade for the course normally is i.e \u20186\u2019. Is this because the marks haven\u2019t been released yet or am I given the opportunity to resit the exam to demonstrate a pass? Thanks Griffith gang. ",

Not sure if this is what may have happened in your case, but it seems they totally neglected my exam results in the final grading for that course.",

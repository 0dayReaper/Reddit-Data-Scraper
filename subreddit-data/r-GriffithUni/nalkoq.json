For some background I have previously completed the bachelor of aviation.\n\nI want to warn people before applying to this degree that. It is very marginalized in comparison to the rest of the university, and overall the degree is ridiculously easy. It does not feel like a real university degree. I felt as if the 20+ grand spend on this degree was ultimately a waste of time because I felt like it was mostly a tick box as opposed to actually useful or applicable to the industry. Some of the first year subjects are good in terms of learning about the industry and how things function and work, however the second year was a complete waste of time and money. Learning the 'CPL' subjects seems applicable but they are taught to an insufficient level leaving you really needing to start from scratch when you go on to your flight training. You get taught basically at best, 20% of what you need to know.  \n\nAdministration wise, the degree was shambles at best. Lecturers were leaving and newer ones where arriving at the time I was studying and this really made things challenging as the university has a system in place where, power points already made had to be used. Therefore a new lecturer would look at the old power point slides and be very confused. \n\nThe exams where ridiculously easy and often carbon copies of final week revision slides. In fact one of my exams they had to cancel 3 questions because they made no sense.\n\nProfessionalism and realistically the degree is not reflective of real world aviation or training. The information might be but the behaviours and attitudes are not fully. \n\nUltimately do I think it is worth doing the bachelor of aviation at Griffith university. Truthfully I think if you are straight out of school, want to pursue aviation and have zero current connections and experience in aviation. This is potentially a good option for you. Ultimately in the end its a 20 something grand tick box to say to people you have completed. I do not feel it has value if you want to pursuit aviation. You are better of either doing a bachelor of aviation management or something else entirely. \n\nMATES- They try to say YOU MUST ATTEND. This is a lie. You don't have too. Only if you want to do the GDFM you should but honestly even than, I doubt they'd say no to your money. \n\nPeople at MATES- I think overall the people in the cohort are nice and friendly but in my time there was some big egos surrounding the mates program. You can always avoid those people, stick with those you like :D\n\nGDFM - I have no completed this I went off and did my training self funded however I have heard nothing but horror stories and the training is treated as if it is some high class, high level air force training. It is not. It is just basair, they also spend your money needlessly and take forever. I completed my CPL in 6 months they took 12 months. \n\nIn summary take a long hard think before applying. If you do the degree, just be aware there is serious problems. Furthermore, make sure to apply to cadetships or similar while studying so that you can escape to something more meaningful and useful.",

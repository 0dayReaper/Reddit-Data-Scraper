    "postText": "Hi all. I\u2019m in second about to go into my third trimester (1st tri 2023) of my first year. Did stats over the \u201cbreak\u201d.\nI am doing 4 classes this semester instead of 3 because 1 of them is just an elective and it\u2019s Drawing While Thinking 1515. The plan is to pack my year so I can have next tri 3 off.\n\nAnyway, I can\u2019t seem to access the \u201creadings\u201d of any of my courses or be given a list of books/equipment I may need for my courses. I\u2019m particularly interested in knowing if I need to buy things for this elective where it may be more than just a book I need but rather , pencils or art portfolio what not or if it\u2019s software based. Lol I\u2019m unsure, the course description does not particularly give me much insight.\n\nSorry if this is a little silly, is there anywhere you can point me to so that I can find this information? \n\nThanks for reading and good luck with your studies :)",

If you get a few \"this list has a newer version\" messages, click through them and you should eventually find one for this upcoming tri. \n\nAs for actually buying stuff, I'd wait until February when the course profiles are finalised and sent out because the reading lists can and will change until then, and the last thing you want to do is drop $$ on a textbook you don't actually need. I'm not even kidding with this; every time i look at the reading list for cognitive neuropsych something's changed.\n\nGood Luck!",

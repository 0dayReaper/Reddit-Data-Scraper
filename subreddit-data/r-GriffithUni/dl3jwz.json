(Griffith is a 97% cutoff high school average while UQ is a 90%). You are right though, UQ is more expensive (in total of 5 years its around 60k aud more). Thank you for your response, I greatly appreciate it :)",

Then again, when I talked with a regional manager for Griffith, she said a 96.5%+ was good enough.",

I am not sure about how many applicants, so can't give you an answer but the website says 25 applicants out of a total of 100 spots. The guy above me said 40% was Canadian though so maybe it is 40 spots.",

If it was 99.8% it would litereally be impossible for them to accept high school students lol. Only 6 people in ontario last year recieved a 99.5+% average, and they were all part of a special program. It is literally impossible for anyone in a normal public school to achieve a 99-100 average in Canada. I mean, even to give a student a 100 in the course, the ministry of education gives the school a call to make sure everything is okay because it looks fishy. Can i ask what email you send it to?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: if it is 99.8% tho i am screwed rip",

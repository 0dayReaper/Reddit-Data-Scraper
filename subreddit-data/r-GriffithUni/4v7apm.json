            "comment": "Recent graduate here :) The main thing I found with the degree was that it's very broad. There's a lot of different things you can specialise in (programming, design (print/game/screen), video/sound production, marketing, etc). Personally I really enjoyed this aspect of it, it gave me a good view of what I liked and what I most certainly didn't like.\n\nCoursework was mostly on point, definitely some bad courses but also really great ones. Many tutors were passionate about what they taught, some... not so much. Mixed bag really, I'd assume it's similar to other degrees. Overall I learned a lot and enjoyed most of the courses I took.\n\nIn terms of career outcomes... you get out what you put in I guess. There's definitely value in having a degree when starting your career. I managed to score a pretty good job even before finishing the degree and I feel that multimedia definitely helped with this.\n\nI don't know what they're changing in this revamp but I would recommend it if you want exposure to what \"multimedia\" is and to have the opportunity to try a whole lot of different things.",

We had a conversation a little while ago and we both agreed that the Bachelor of Multimedia is pretty useless unless you do a dual degree. IT is the best choice. I know more than one person who has had trouble finding work after graduating from that degree. ",

    "postText": "Hello!\n\nAre  you in your final semester of your Business/Business-related degree or recently completed it? Do you know what steps you are going to take next?  Yes/No/Not sure?\u00a0No matter the answer, [I'd love to hear from you](https://qsurvey.qut.edu.au/jfe/form/SV_1MknIpd887Gf37w)!\n\nMy  PhD research is trying to understand how recent graduates (and those  who are just about to finish their studies) manage the transition from being a student into the next adventure of their lives. In particular,  I'm looking for people who have completed (or are\u00a0just about to complete) studies in Business or a Business-related degree (e.g.  Management/Finance/Commerce etc).\n\nResults will help inform universities\u00a0*and*\u00a0employers to help better support this transition. My initial study involves a short survey with the\u00a0**possibility to win 1 of 4 $50 vouchers**, and also to nominate whether you have interest in future participation (this would be a paid interview).\n\nThe link to the survey again is [here](https://qsurvey.qut.edu.au/jfe/form/SV_1MknIpd887Gf37w),  so if you have a spare few minutes I'd love to hear from you. Please  feel free to share with other Business school students/recent grads!",

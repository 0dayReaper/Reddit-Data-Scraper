    "postText": "Hey all, I'm 19 and really new to this whole uni thing. I want to be a police officer and having a degree tends to help big time with that, so I want to study something law related (along the lines of criminology). I'm posting this to the 3 uni subreddits (Griffith, QUT, and UQ) and I just wanted the opinion of those with a bit more knowledge about these universities. Which uni would you recommend for pursuing a degree in the field of law (and also why if you feel like going into detail :) ). I really appreciate any help that can be offered, thanks.",

            "comment": "For policing id definitely suggest doing a criminology degree, there are many courses in it that would benefit you. As far as universities go the Griffith school of criminology is ranked 38th in the world, with only Monash uni (Australian) being above it. Id also say that criminology is definitely one of Griffiths flagship courses.",

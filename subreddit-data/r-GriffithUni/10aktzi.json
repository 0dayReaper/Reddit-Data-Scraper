            "comment": "hey!\n3rd year bus. student here,\nIn all honesty, I think the first year business courses were designed really well to make the first year of uni as comfortable as possible, so you won\u2019t find that they\u2019re overly difficult regarding content and what\u2019s required of you in assignments. \n\nFrom my experience, I recall most students finding 1008GBS (Business Decision-Making) and 1006GBS (Why Money Matters) to be the more difficult of the foundation courses, as part of those courses had a couple maths components which were a little tricky to understand. However, they are still first year course/ and a lot of support is given to students if they are struggling to understand certain concept.\n\nI found the overall experience of first year naturally quite nerve-racking at the beginning, however the uni does offer a lot of opportunities and support to help first year students (and particularly international students) to feel more settled in. Regarding the academic side of your studies, the business school runs a program called P.A.S.S (you\u2019ll be introduced to this when you begin classes), which is like a group run study session focusing on each week\u2019s content in your first year courses - I highly recommend attending things like this not only to make studying easier, but also to help yourself make some friends in your first year.\n\nAs for student life, the university has many market days with food stalls, social events hosted at the uni bar such as trivia nights, the odd party now and then, social sports, and there are plenty of social clubs and societies that you can join to get the most out of your time at university.\n\nOverall, I found in my first year that the university offers a lot of assistance and opportunities to get out and meet people, however it\u2019s very important that if you want to make friends you must put in effort and perhaps go out of your comfort zone to do it. Generally going to class and not involving yourself too much in anything makes it harder to make friends and get to know people - so I highly recommend getting involved in as much as you can/as you\u2019re comfortable with. \n\nHope this helps! Best of luck",

I have several parents from Thailand but have never been there, and I\u2019ve seen that it is not a conpetitive country to earn it. seems like Europe and the whole Utrecht Network is the real deal for everyone looking for an exchange.",

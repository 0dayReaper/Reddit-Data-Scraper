    "postText": "Hello, I am a student that will enroll in Griffith university nursing major next year as 1st yr. I'm really nervous and unsure if this path is correct for me, and so I was wondering if anyone could help me prepare beforehand in terms of academics(e.g. any textbooks or lectures I could look into before) or give any tips in general.\nThank you.",

I wish that I had prepared more with the basics of anatomy and physiology (A&amp;P) coz that was pretty hardcore. Other than A&amp;P and the continuing pathophysiology/pharmacology classes , the classes are pretty fun and nothing you can really prepare for. Don\u2019t waste your money on textbooks. The online course contents links you to sections that you might need for free and there are free online ones floating around on Facebook groups too. Using an iPad has been a game changer for me this year. I can watch the mini lectures, screenshot them as I go and add notes/drawings on top etc.",

I even strongly suggest you that you do your recorded classes/note-taking during O week or the week before week 1 so you stay on-top of things.\n\nGood luck!",

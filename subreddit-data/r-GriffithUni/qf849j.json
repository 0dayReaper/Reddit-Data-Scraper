            "comment": "Hey, I haven't personally lived at the Conservatorium or Southbank but I'm enrolled at Nathan and have both lived on campus, and in partnered accom off-campus. I think it's honestly up to what you're personally looking for! On campus can be *much* more social, and you're guaranteed to be with people who are also doing university at Griffith, off-campus you may end up with people who aren't even students, and also could end up in units/apartments with much less people than say, dorms or a flat on-campus. So, it really depends how social you want to be! I do recommend on-campus as it is certainly a fun time but, if you're much more introverted you may want to go for off-campus - though, on-campus you will still always have your room to escape to, and anywhere on the actual campus you can find to hide away in as they're always open to some degree, but kitchens etc are shared spaces of course, so something to think about!\n\nEdit: Also, on campus you never have to worry much about transport to your classes. Just kinda gotta walk there and you're good. So, positives around, consider what matches you best and of course, you can always change at the end of the trimester if it doesn't work for you!",

Most people I know either commute from home (as far away as Noosa or Gold Coast) , or find a few housemates to share a unit/house with. Also, parking around Southbank is atrocious... but so are inner city rent rates!",

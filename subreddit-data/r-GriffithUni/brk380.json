    "postText": "Just wondering if anyone has an idea how long it usually takes to get a response in regards to an application for an extension? I\u2019ve submitted the application for two assignments due to personal reasons and received one response the same day (approved), however for the second one I\u2019m still waiting and the due date is today.\n\nI\u2019m powering through trying to finalise my draft to ensure it\u2019s ready to submit but wonder if there\u2019s any sort of special consideration since my lecturer hasn\u2019t responded. I\u2019ve tried finding the information myself but haven\u2019t had any luck so was wondering if anyone else has been in this situation. \n\nMy situation has meant I\u2019m close on two weeks behind and have been working non-stop since things were resolved to catch up but I feel like I might miss the cut off for this assignment.",

Make sure you email them, but some are pretty bad about keeping up with their inbox. \n\nI haven't had many extensions, but they were usually understanding in ENV. If you have put in for the extension in advance, they should be able to see that this isn't a last minute thing.",

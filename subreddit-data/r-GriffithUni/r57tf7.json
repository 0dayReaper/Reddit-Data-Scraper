If it's for a year It would be pretty achievable. \n\nYou use spend your $511/611 (+95 rent assistance) of Centrelink on rent/utilities and transport. Then you have 400 a fortnight to spend on food and other expenses. \n\nTry budget some things out. Might be nice to get a room with utilities included in your rent so you don't need to worry about it and it stays the same.",

    "postText": "I am an exchange student and I will come to study for Trimester 1 on Griffith University. I finished 2nd year of Computer Science in Europe and the exchange is part of my 3rd year. I am wondering what are some interesting courses in regards to Computer Science that are not too hard (don't want to just study while in Australia). \n\nAlso I would like to know how hard of a workload is 3 courses for 1 trimester?",

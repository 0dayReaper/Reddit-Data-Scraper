    "postText": "A team of researchers from the University of Queensland are working hard to improve the support we can offer to families of autistic children. As part of this important work, we are developing a new questionnaire to measure parents\u2019 acceptance and understanding of their autistic child. We need ***your*** help to develop this measure!\n\nResearchers from **The University of Queensland** are seeking parents who currently reside in Australia to participate in an online study that aims to better understand the experiences and perspectives of parents of autistic children. Participants will complete an online survey (20-30 minutes) followed by a brief (approximately 10-minutes) follow-up online survey two weeks later. For more information see comments below, or to complete the survey, please visit: [https://exp.psy.uq.edu.au/autism](https://exp.psy.uq.edu.au/autism?fbclid=IwAR3UemhWb8HCuLSzFCPWG7XtdxRKiGHCPTzBQopA9bwOwwLDULH2OhuI2Zo)\n\nFor further information, contact Sarah Lee on [lee.jy.sarah@uq.net.au](mailto:lee.jy.sarah@uq.net.au).",

            "comment": "**Why is this research so important?**\r  \n\r  \nThe mental health of autistic people is strongly influenced by whether or not they feel accepted by those around them. We already know that parents\u2019 acceptance of their child\u2019s autism diagnosis is linked to better outcomes for autistic children and their parents, however, there is currently no research on parent\u2019s acceptance of their whole autistic child.\r  \n\r  \nDeveloping a questionnaire to measure parents\u2019 acceptance and understanding of their autistic child is a crucial next step in helping us to promote greater understanding and acceptance of autism and to improve the support that we can offer to families of autistic children. \\[1/2\\]",

In a previous study, we asked autistic adults to reflect on their childhood experiences of being parented, including what was helpful and important, and what was not helpful. They told us that unconditional acceptance and understanding of autism was extremely important to them.\r  \n\r  \nFrom their responses, we have created a new questionnaire to measure parents\u2019 acceptance and understanding of their autistic child. The purpose of the study is to test this new questionnaire, which may be used in future research and clinical practice with families of autistic children.\r  \n\r  \nParents (i.e., adults fulfilling a parental role, including adoptive and foster parents or legal guardians) of autistic children (including diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder or Asperger\u2019s syndrome) between the ages of 2 and 18 years are invited to participate in an anonymous online survey which will take approximately 20-30 minutes to complete. Parents will be sent a second much shorter (approximately 10 minutes) follow-up survey 2 weeks later.\r  \n\r  \nThis study has been approved in accordance with the ethical review processes of The University of Queensland and within the guidelines of the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research (Ethical clearance # 2022/HE001419). \\[2/2\\]",

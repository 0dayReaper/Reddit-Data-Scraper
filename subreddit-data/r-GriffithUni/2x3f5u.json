I have found a few people who have mentioned it to me so I am considering starting one.\n\nCurrently I know of 3 (including me) definite students who are interested and 2 nonaffiliated people, and the requirement is 15 with 80% of the members being affiliated with the university.\n\nWe currently plan on playing more mature boardgames, such as:\n\n- The Resistance: Avalon\n- Ticket to Ride\n- Cosmic Encounter\n\nA mate of mine already has a fairly sizeable collection that we can borrow a few games from while we start up, it's 42 games large and can be viewed here: \n\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/NightmareBC?own=1&amp;subtype=boardgame&amp;ff=1\n\nWho would be interested in signing up and participating? I am primarily gauging interest but if I can pull together the numbers I will definitely submimt all the paperwork.",

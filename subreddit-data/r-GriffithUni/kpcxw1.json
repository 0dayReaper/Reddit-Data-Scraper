It's your best opportunity to get a feel for all that's available and give you an idea of how things will operate in an online environment. It's a bit quiet here but feel free to ask me any questions.",

I was the same and I saw it as an opportunity to reshape myself. No one knows who I am so it was the opportunity to create the new self. This has lead to a whole new experience and a change in life, I'll be a student mentor in 2021 and was accepted into the Griffith Honours College. Uni will give you what you ask of it, but only if your asking :)",

Thank you for the tip as well, I will try to have some more confidence to get to places I need to go and learn to communicate better with others for new experiences. It will be quite difficult but letting people know who I am does sound worth it \ud83d\ude0a",

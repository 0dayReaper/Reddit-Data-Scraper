For me to go into uni to spend maybe an hour actually doing some work after unpacking and then packing up. I'm a fine arts student. Just asking if anyone has advice. What should i ask my tutors, especially as high risk and possibly moving house again soon?",

However from my experience, studying online with Griffith University is fantastic, and I haven't had any issues worth noting.",

I'm trying to figure if it's fine for me to go in one day a week or just do all study online again this year. Besides maybe exhibitions. I'm also maybe going to move house again soon. We don't know yet if that's certain or not. Another thing is that my mother and I are high risk. She's studying from home too. As that's all she can deal with.",

One of them said that a girl would fly up from Sydney and stay dawn till dusk in the studios once or twice a week. Bit of a weird comparison to make considering most uni students don\u2019t have that kind of money. I have another painting class completely online. With the same Convenor forcing me to go on campus for the other class. Idk who they think this benefits when they then say afterward that they try to refrain from saying things that could cause upsets. You say what now?",

Sure the vaccines are rolling out but university needs to keep the options for online study open even whenever there's no severity of the virus. It's just a given.",

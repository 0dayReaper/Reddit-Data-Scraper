    "postText": "I applied to Griffith earlier in the year for a Masters Program and was wondering if anyone had an idea (or personal experience) as to how long I will have to wait to hear something back?  I've been logging in to the \"Future Students\" portal and have been tracking the progress there, however for the last week or so my application has simply said \"Evaluation Complete\" with no indication or contact in regards to the outcome of the evaluation.    \n\n\nHas anyone had this happen to them?  Any ideas how long it will be before I hear what the result of the evaluation is?  My second preference is still showing as \"Pending\" and I know that until a decision is made either way in regards to my first preference this won't change but it feels like I've been waiting forever to hear anything!

    "postText": "Hey everyone! International student from the US here in my final year of high school. I am applying to Griffith's Bachelor of Medical Science/Doctor of Medicine pathway program which gives provisional entry to MD.\n\nAnyone know how competitive this program is for internationals specifically? How is the interview? I'm applying through ozTREKK if that makes a difference. If it includes ATAR, any way to convert my USA exam scores (SAT/ACT) to ATAR? Thanks!",

            "comment": "Griffith\u2019s Bachelor of Medsci + Doctor of Medicine pathway is very competitive as it requires an ATAR score of 99.85, which is equivalent to ACT 36/ SAT 1580+. Also, you need a close to perfect GPA. Unlike other medical schools, Griffith does not have any prerequiste subjects/interviews, which means that applicant selection is purely based on how high your GPA and standardized test (SAT/ACT/IB) score is.",

There are also subject pre requisites which might be fulfilled by APs like bio and chem but I\u2019m not so sure - you\u2019ll need to check the website and/or contact admissions. Make sure you have these before applying.",

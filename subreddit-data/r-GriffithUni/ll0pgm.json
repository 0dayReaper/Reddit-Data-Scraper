    "postText": "Hello! I am interested in taking up Bachelor of Medical Sciences in the Griffith Uni Gold Coast campus. I wanted to ask about the workload and difficulty. Will I still be able to work for 20 hours per week and maintain a GPA of 5.0 (needed to be eligible for medicine)? As an international student, will I be able to easily adjust to the rigors of the program? Also, how is the student life in Griffith Uni Gold Coast campus?Thank you so much!",

Even though the workload can get intense sometimes, I still find time to hang out with friends and stuff. If you have any questions you can PM me!",

As long as you prioritise time and keep on top of your work load, it\u2019s entirely possible. \nIf your English in the post anything to go by, I think you\u2019ll be just fine adjusting to the course intensity. Just make sure you don\u2019t stress out too much and relax a little! It is a lot to take on.",

    "postText": "Why does Griffith Security seem to despise high school students so vehemently? \n\nI suppose I understand that a lot of them cause trouble at the GC campus, but it seems like the move to a 24/7 library this year was just to keep high school kids out, and most of them genuinely want to use this place to study...\n\nSeems counter-intuitive that Griffith would irritate and neglect a future generation of students. \n\nThoughts?",

We all know that every university in the Global North seeks for every opportunity to segregate. It was just a quite convenient time for Griffith to finally shut them out of a public space from a public university.",

            "comment": "I see some folks saying these students should go to public libraries. The closest public libraries to the GC campus are the Southport Library (which closes at 6pm / 4pm on weekends) and the Nerang Library (which closes at 6pm / incredible 1pm on weekends). None of them open before 9am.\n\nAnyone who\u2019s been a student for at least 10 years knows that these working hours are lame and literally every hour counts for our academic progress. GC Library used to work from *7am to 8pm* on weekdays before the 24/7 move, thus no wonder why it is the favourite. Plus, its size and structure is incomparable to the ones I mentioned.\n\nMy thought is that this is a lazy, elitist, and quite convenient solution from Griffith. If the issue was them not paying it would have happened a long time ago; they want to segregate the uni community from the rest.\n\n-Create an *application system based on grades* for high school students interested on using the library? \n\n-Limit the weekly hours allowed to enter/leave the library for high schoolers? \n\n-Reinforce security at peak times? (we are ALSO paying to be safe on campus).\n\nNo. Of course not. Just shut them out!",

It is the uni\u2019s obligation to provide the most excellent security services as possible. \nThe issue is that Griffith is profiting off the \u201ccost efficiency\u201d argument over that just because it is convenient - if it was a priority, the library shutdown would have been implemented earlier. \nIts security services have the duty to be reinforced over the goal of serving the broad community. Also, it is not hard at all to create and sophisticate special security services to assure that high schoolers are there on designated times. \n\nJust imagine how much of them would enroll at Griffith after spending their high school years studying at the library. I am not supporting that because I am a blind idealistic. It is a clever investment with mostly guaranteed profit return. \n\nThe main question of concern, however (and I assume we agree on that), is Griffith poorly designed policies over the access to the uni facilities. Griffith is not Bond; it is a public university and it cannot be 100% locked to outsiders. The discussion should be which of these facilities will be open to the main community and which won\u2019t. Griffith enables and shuts down access according to its own convenience, and for a public uni to do that is almost tyrannical.",

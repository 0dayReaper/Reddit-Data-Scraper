    "postText": "The admissions page says a 99.80 atar (no adjustment factors/bonus ranks) is required, which seems incredibly high. Is the cohort just very small and if it is really so competitive, is there a way to get in by some other means without having to sit the UCAT because I read they are going to begin requiring UCAT as of 2022.",

            "comment": "No, so essentially the 99.80 is the ATAR required. Depending on the competitiveness of the applications this may drop a little or stay the same (its just based on previous info). 99.80 is reasonably high given the cut offs for medicine (i'm a griffith MSc/MD student who got in via ATAR). In fact the USyd cut off in 2018 was 99.75 (+interview) so that is interesting. But Dentistry in the past has taken lower ATARS (99.70, 99.60 even). But regardless the cut offs for both medicine and dentistry reflect how competitive entry is at ANY university and the people in the cohort (which by the way is relatively small as griffith tends not to overextend themselves when it comes to numbers and calibrate pretty well in terms based on resources available) will all have achieved an at minimum an atar of 99.00 (OP1) with the medians being near the published cut offs. So you really need to be up there to have a chance! \n\nGriffith will soon require the UCAT which will act in addition to the ATAR. There is no alternative direct entry pathway. UQ has a lower ATAR requirement (99.0 WITH bonus ranks , efficelty 97 if you take the right subjects but compensates with a higher UCAT requirement/interviews). So all in all its more or less just as hard.",

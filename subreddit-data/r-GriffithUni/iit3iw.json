But a better base of knowledge going into med. \nA lot of people ive met in biomed want to go into med. \n\nIn bsc you get more elective and flexibility but not as focused. People in bsc often want to go to research. \n\nThere is still plenty of cross over for both degrees. A lot of classes are together except for in first year. \nSo maybe go based on which classes you like better",

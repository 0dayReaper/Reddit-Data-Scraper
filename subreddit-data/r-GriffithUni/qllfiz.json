    "postText": "Hello,  \nMy name is Aaron, and I had difficulty in the transition from high school to tertiary education. I am looking for volunteer respondents for 30-minute interviews with students to hear about their experiences. Because I had so much trouble with my experiences, we want to help facilitate better connections between learners and educators. To do so we need to interview students about their experiences along their learning journey. From that knowledge shared, we can start to identify key themes of the learner experience, like the areas that are thriving, and why it is that it is working so well.  \nIf you would like to volunteer to talk to us about your learning experiences, please complete this form -\u00a0 [https://forms.clickup.com/f/6kgfc-268/RODBN3GDKPPQ4XDZGL](https://forms.clickup.com/f/6kgfc-268/RODBN3GDKPPQ4XDZGL)  \nThank you for your time.",

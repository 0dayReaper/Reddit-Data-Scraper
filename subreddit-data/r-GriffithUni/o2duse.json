I think for COVID atm most of the classes are online even if they say blended, but once domestic students are back on campus there will still be the online option!\nGood luck, I hope you love it",

A couple exams are short response, the questions for these are just the weekly content questions, so make sure to do these. To be honest the course is pretty easy as long as you follow along with the content. No group work in any of the subjects I've done and I doubt there is any if it's all online.",

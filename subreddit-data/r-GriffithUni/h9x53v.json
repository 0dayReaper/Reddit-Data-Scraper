    "postText": "Hi everyone. \n\nI am an Architectural Technology graduate residing in Canada, Ontario. \n\nAbit of myself: I graduated in 2018, with 6 months of work experience at an Engineering firm. I also spent a two years gap of heavily attempting to enroll in a local Architecture University (the reason why is to be close for my parent's financial and mental support) in my area.   \n\n\nAs for this year to plan out alternative solutions, I am thinking of enrolling in Griffith University's Architecture Design Degree. Can anyone share their experiences to me from the following points I have in consideration?\n\n\\- The type of drafting software used? Example; Revit, Sketchup, 3Dsmax, Rhino. \n\n\\- Class size?\n\n\\- It is worth attending this university?\n\n\\- Group based projects or individual projects? If both, can you tell me the percentage of them involved? Ex; The program is mainly involved 80% of group projects and 20% in the entire duration of the program. \n\n\\- Are there more assignments given out? or more tests and fewer assignments?\n\nONLY to  International students or domestic students who transferred in another Architectural Technology or related program:  I know credits are transferred, but can you transfer a higher year in the program? Like year 2 or 3. \n\n\\- Are there summer courses to speed up the program duration?\n\n\\- I was told there is co- op offered, in what year do you begin in? \n\n\\- Ultimately, what should i prepare or tips before enrolling in the program?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading.",

If in doubt talk to your first year coordinator. \n\nImportant to note: Griffith IT does not have a normal third trimester all subjects in third trimester are in intensive mode (do 12 weeks of course content in 12 days, so 9-5 every day for 3 weeks). \n\nBecause of this it is generally not a good idea to mix and match them with third trimester courses from other degrees. If you intend to do more then 1 subject in your third trimester avoid IT courses unless you are willing to make the commitment to a very intense third trimester.",

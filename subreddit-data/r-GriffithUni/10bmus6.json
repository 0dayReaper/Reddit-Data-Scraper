    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI have just secured an offer for the Bachelor of Dental Health Science course for the 2023 intake. Whilst it is very exciting, I will be moving from interstate (Melbourne). Is there any advice/feedback for this course as well as suggestions for on-campus vs. off-campus accommodation at Gold Coast? Is off-campus accomodation provided by the university just as safe as living on campus? Also any feedback on course faculty?\n\nThanks :)",

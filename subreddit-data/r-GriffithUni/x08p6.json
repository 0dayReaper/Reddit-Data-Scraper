If you go up University road loads of people park just after the roundabout, is that free? Is parking near the stadium allowed (and not ticketable!)?\n\nThanks for your help folks",

            "comment": "Any parking between the motorway and the 'Griffith Uni' sign is free and untimed, last time I checked. It fills up pretty quickly though. Once you go past the sign and past the ticket dispenser, it's all uni property, and all the parking restrictions come into force.\n\nThere is some free parking at the stadium, but only in particular areas eg I think on the ring road around the stadium is ticketable. I think there's more info on the Griffith Parking website, as apparently the uni and the stadium have some arrangement with parking.\n\nAnother option is that there's a free park and ride on Klumpp Road next to the sports complex. You could always park there and get the 120 into uni (comes every 15 min).",

Sometimes it's closed off for school sports carnivals or whatever but you'll just be redirected down to the carpark there (slightly longer walk).\n\n\nAlso, if you have classes late afternoon/night, parking in the main carpark on campus without paying shouldn't be a worry. I've done this the past two semesters and never got a fine. (Park at your own risk).",

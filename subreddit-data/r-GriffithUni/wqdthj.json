What are the main focused subjects/ type of field work (Screenwriting, producing, directorial, etc.) \n\n2. What is the practical/ theory ratio? \n\n3. If you could move to a different school in Australia, where would you go? \n\n4. Is it genuinely fun &amp; would you say that it\u2019s worth it? \n\nAnd feel free to add some more opinions/ advice around the course, thanks!",

            "comment": "I\u2019m in my second year studying this course. There are no electives first year so they try to teach you a little bit of everything.\n\nFirst trimester has classes on analysing films, how to use the equipment (camera,lighting,sound) and a class on editing then you put all of these elements together to create a short film with about 6-8 other people in the course.\n\nSecond trimester is a bit different. The three courses are on script writing, tv studio production and creating visual effects.\n\nThen the course really opens up with the start of second year, you can choose which elective you want and there\u2019s a pretty good variety to choose from. This\u2019ll definitely enhance and aspect of film your interested in working on.\n\nAt the start of the course they are very clear that just from the course alone you will only be on set for around 20-25 days which really isn\u2019t many. They really encourage you to go out and get onto sets yourself.\n\nI think if you view it as something you have to do you won\u2019t enjoy it. Film will have to be your passion. \n\nFrom what I\u2019ve heard about other film campuses, Griffith is definitely the way to go. JMC Academy is too costly and I\u2019ve heard that a lot of the lecturers are questionable. \n\nIf you have any more questions I\u2019m happy to answer them!",

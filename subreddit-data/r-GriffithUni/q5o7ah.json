    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm currently going through the application process to get into the Graduate of Cyber Security Certificate program to then do my Masters. I'm applying based on prior work experience (a little over 5 years as a sys admin)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was wondering if anyone here has applied for a program using work experience and if so, how long your application review took to get an answer? I'm aware that it would vary case by case but would still like to hear about how long it took for other people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

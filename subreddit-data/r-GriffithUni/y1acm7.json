    "postText": "Hey!! I am a 19 year old girl from Canada and I applied to the Bachelors of Psychological Science programme for the beginning of the 2023 term. I wanted to know a little more about GU from people who are already there rather than just the website :))\n\nI saw that the Gold Coast campus had a Student village and wanted to know if it is fun to live there and is it easy to make friends? Since I\u2019m coming from a long way I want to go to a place where it is relatively easy to meet people and with stuff to do. Also do people go out to party, or is it mostly just chillin with friends? \n\nI also wanted to know about the academics; is the psychology programme super hard or is it manageable? Are profs good; are they hard graders?\n\nThank you to anyone who takes the time to respond, I really appreciate it &lt;3",

            "comment": "The psychology program in the Bachelor of Psych Science at Griffith is accredited with Australia's national accediting body for psychology (APAC), so it meets or exceeds the national standards.  Some courses will be more difficult than others, depending on where your strenths lie.  For example some students find the three years of statistics challenging if they are not mathematically inclined.  Others eat stats for breakfast!\n\nAs always, before embarking on an undergraduate degree in psychology, you should give some thought to what you want to do with it afterwards.  A psych degree can lead to all sorts of different jobs, but if you have your heart set on being a psychologist, just be aware that there is at least 3 additional years of study required after the 3-year BPsychSci degree, and that entry into Honours (4-year) and postgrad study can be quite competitive.\n\nIf you have any specific questions about the program, feel free to DM me, as I am very familiar with the undergraduate and postgraduate psych programs at GU.",

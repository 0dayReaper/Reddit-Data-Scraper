I  am only taking two courses this semester due to them being intensives.   \n \n\nI'm currently trying to plan enrollment in my courses for next year, trimester 1.   \n \n\nMy questions are:   \n \n\nDo you have to take all first year subjects within one year of being at Griffith University?   \n \n\n\u00a0If I'm commencing studies in trimester 3 this year and doing 2 courses -  am I still able to do trimester 3 in 2020 to complete the remaining  first year trimester 3 courses I wasn't able to do in 2019?    \n\n\nThankyou!",

They are run as regular courses at these times, so there's no real need to wait until Tri 3 2020 to finish.\n\nThere's no time pressure to finish all the first year courses within a year (unless they changed the rules recently). The only thing you'll want to consider is your study load and whether you need to meet requirements for full-time study loads (which should be a minimum of 3x courses per Trimester).",

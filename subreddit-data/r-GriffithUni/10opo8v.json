    "postText": "I live relatively far away from campus and will not always be able to attend classes so would like to do a mix of online and on-campus classes. I'm wondering which option I should enroll in?\n\nIf I enroll in online classes is it easy to attend classes on campus every now and then? I assume you just have to email the tutor.\n\nOtherwise, if I enroll in on-campus classes is it okay to skip them and attend the online classes instead?\n\nWhich option should I choose?",

Some only have options available for Online classes. I dont think it particularly matters, however you might be best asking student services since this is just my personal experience.\n\nEdit: As for skipping on campus classes, all of my classes offer online lectures that are pre recorded available 24/7 ahead of time. In fact, most of the students from my classes stopped coming to class after the 2nd week of the first trimester, opting to use the pre recorded lectures.",

    "postText": "I've been on amber status since I started my degree and my GPA is currently at 3.2. I've done 150/240 CP. If I pass 20 CP but fail a 20CP course (most likely I'll receive a 3 for it) this semester how badly will this damage my GPA?\n\nAnd would they most likely be tempted to put me down to red status now/exclude me?\n\nI'm sitting at 55% but the exam required 40% or more to pass the course and I'm worried as fuck.\n\nI'm planned to graduate at the end of next semester doing 50 CP. 20 of these is the industry project and the rest are pretty easy courses. Unfortunately, it was all down to this one 20CP course this semester but it was pretty difficult and I don't deal with stress/exams well.",

    "postText": "I'm a online student commencing in 2023, Just wondering on the enrolment page it says you must attend the lecture and workshop online at a specific time. Can I watch the lecture recordings after work as I work full time during the day. Can you mark your attendance yourself or you have to physcially join the live lecture to be marked?\n\nAny answers will be appreciated\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/szny7bktajga1.png?width=702&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f0ef0c837804d4b05f7aeed32bfafbe041a0561b",

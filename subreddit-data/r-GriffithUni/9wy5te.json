If the course profile, which is available long before enrolment opens, shows there is a weekly lecture, which for some reason isn't taking place, you should simply ask for a refund of the course fees. I can't see why they would have any issue doing so. I do think, however, that perhaps you had unrealistic expectations of the content of the course you signed up for, and should check again before enrolling in the future. This of course applies at all institutions, and all courses. ",

You can however, inquire to them about which books/texts are required for your course instead of waiting until week 2 when you course convener finally gets around to posting it. \n2. Best pace for textbooks is second hand. Plenty of students will finish their unit and will be willing to offload their texts books for a pretty big discount. I typically use this website [https://studentvip.com.au/](https://studentvip.com.au/)\n3. If you really don't want to pay for text books you can usually find the PDF version online either significantly discounted or for free (if you look around enough) (unless it one of those bs course specific, uni specific books.) I use this website all the time [http://gen.lib.rus.ec/](http://gen.lib.rus.ec/)\n4. If you're lucky, your course will have their text book available for free in the readings section (yay). Unfortunately, they'll typically be limited to 3 copies so only 3 people can access it at one time. But there is a way to get it your own copy for as long as you want and for free. Sometimes, you'll have the option to download the textbook and have access to it for 24hours. If you do this you can simply download a crack for what ever format the e-book is in and there you go, free premium quality textbook.\n5. Having to pay for parking is bs, but unless you want to risk a parking fine of $70 there are a few places where it is free. For MG only option is at the base of the hill (soz). For Nathan you can park near the entry to the cemetery and Drug Research Center. For GC...idk I think the hospital is a bit cheaper than the uni tho. ",

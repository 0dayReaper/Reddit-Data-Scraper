    "postText": "hey! I am a first year in the bachelor of adv bus and seemed compelled to apply for a trimester exchange under the study abroad program. I have some family in Thailand but have never been there myself; it would be great to spend a trimester abroad in Chulalongkorn.\n\nis someone able to tell me the different levels of competition towards each region + what would be a satisfactory GPA to secure a place? seems like Europe is the real deal (all unis have that \u201chighly competitive\u201d warning at the top of the page) but interest for studying in Asia generally appears to be weak.",

            "comment": "Might have changed, but there isn't much competition for places from Australia - much more from o/s wanting to exchange into Griffith. \n\nKeep your marks as high as possible for better choice and any scholarships. There was a great bursary from UMAP for people that had over 5/7 GPA I think. \n\nIf you can qualify for Centrelink before you go you can still receive this while overseas studying. Makes it more accessible for more students. We should encourage folks way more to take up the opportunity. \n\nSuch a great experience, go do it!!",

Not much in the way of wildlife around the campus bar some scrub turkeys but there should be plenty of places in greater Brisbane to do research.\n\nBrisbane itself is not the biggest city in the world, well by area it's close, but it's not very dense. I'm not sure what you mean by 'big city environment' but it's busy enough for me. Melbourne and Sydney are by far bigger cities but I don't think you'll get as close to the wildlife down that way as you would up here. \n\nHope that helps a little bit.",

If I do study abroad, I think Griffith is my first choice. If I went to Nathan, is it easy to get around?  I'm leaning towards that campus because of my major, but it seems like I should explore the Gold Coast area.",

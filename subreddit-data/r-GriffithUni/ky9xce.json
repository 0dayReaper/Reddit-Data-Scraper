    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nI'm moving interstate from Melbourne to Gold Coast pretty soon and am in search of an apartment, preferably with air-conditioning as I've heard that GC is hotter and more humid than Melb.\n\nI've been warned off student accommodation such as Griffith University Village and Nexus and am really leaning towards Smith Collective. Just would like to gather some opinions before I jump right in :)\n\nThanks in advance!",

            "comment": "I also think Smith Collective is a solid option and just checked out the location yesterday, it's really close to woolworth and the griffith campus which is very nice, but the $380+ for one bedroom apartment is a joke when two bedroom is $420+, anyone interested in renting a two bedroom apartment together?",

Therefore I was thinking of moving into University Village for the first year, then moving out once I get a better feel for the place or meet someone else who wants to.",

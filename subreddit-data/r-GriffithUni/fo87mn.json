    "postText": "Accomodation's sent us a rather threatening email telling us that if anyone isn't concerned with their wellbeing (wtf does this mean), the wellbeing of others or their studies, they stay can be terminated instantly. This is all fine and well for students who have families to go to, but what about people without families the university can basically throw out for vague reasons at its own disgression? Are they spewing hot air at us because the virus will make them run away with their tails between their legs and they won't have RAs and security running around to make sure people follow the rules? Will they just expel everyone anyway, even those who would realistically become homeless? It's temporary accommodation so RTA protections don't apply.",

We live in Canada though (we have Oz citizenship), so while she is there she wouldn\u2019t have anywhere to go in an event like this. I would hope they would allow the students to stay in cases where they literally have no family in the country to go home to. While this doesn\u2019t impact us directly right now it would definitely influence our decision on where to send her for school!",

So, the shitstorm making students homeless would bring would damage the university's reputation beyond repair.",

    "postText": "I understand that a W grade is GPA neutral and wont bring down or raise it. so if you drop a course before the date that stops you from receiving academic penalty you get a W grade for the course. my question is: does anyone know if multiple W's in your academic history is seen generally unfavorably by employers. if you have a degree and a 4.5 GPA or something like that, but in your years of university you've gotten a couple of W's (again just clarifying i mean the grade that isn't an academic penalty). do employers not like that, or do they just focus on the GPA and other interview criteria.",

    "postText": "G'Day Stalkers,\n\nFollowing from my earlier post, the email directly from the University due to go out today may now be sent tomorrow morning at the latest due to the fire at Nathan campus last night.\n\nBelow is a transcript of information relayed to me by Senior VC (Academic) Debra Henly, as well as a Q and A of your most common questions shared here and elsewhere on social media.\n\nDue to the delay in official comms caused by the fire, Debra has given me the Green light to share this with you in advance of the email.\n\n(I won't be responding to questions in the comments tonight- I'm a student too and need to get things done!)\n\nHere it is:\n\n\"The University\u2019s position at Friday was based on QLD Health guidelines - since the weekend, things have developed quickly and the University has responded appropriately.\n\nThe University is proactively moving learning activities (lectures and tutorials) to be online in the shortest possible timing. This week will be the last week for face-to-face lectures.\n\nVery large \u200blectures with enrolments over 300 are to stop from today, students in those classes will be advised via email and SMS. Smaller ones to progressively stop over the week.\n\nTutorials to progressively follow.\n\nA total transition is to set to be completed by Tuesday, 14th of April.\n\nLabs, pracs, and studios to go for as long as feasibly possible \u200band safe to continue. Some activities will be brought forward where possible. The University is being careful that any transition in teaching delivery and/or alteration of the course will be able to meet the same learning outcomes.\n\nCleaning is ramped up around campuses - double the amount of cleaners have been hired to wipe down door handles, keyboards, elevator buttons, etc.\n\nStudents will be able to be spread out in a classroom as more classes transition online.\n\nPlease note that this plan is still subject to change without notice pending government and health authority decisions and advice.\n\nThe University is also starting to plan for not having end of trimester exams but keeping teaching going as long as possible. Other forms of assessment at this stage will continue, mid-trimester exams are still scheduled to go ahead. An individual course may try to change their mid-trimester assessments pending decisions made by the Course Convenor.\"\n\nQ: \u201cScott Morrison talked yesterday about making efforts to flatten the curve of coronavirus cases. Social distancing is a key factor in this, what is the university doing to help facilitate social distancing on campus?\u201d\n\nA: Cleaning is ramped up around campuses. As more suitable classes are transitioned online, students that need to attend a tutorial in-person will be able to be spread out in a classroom. As ever, Echo360 lecture capture facilities are available.\n\nQ: \u201cIf Griffith is moving to put learning activities online, will in-person classes still be available for those who want to come in?\u201d\n\nA: For now, yes but this is a rapidly changing situation. The collaborate functionality will be rolled out soon where you can still see your lecturer/tutor and ask questions in a live chat.\n\nQ: \u201cAre special considerations being made for students who live with an elderly person or immunocompromised person\u201d\n\nA: Yes - Get in touch with the student connect helpline, they are ready to assist students on a case-by-case basis.\n\nQ: \u201cIf the university did decide to follow UQ, will students, etc still be able to go to their labs, pracs, studio sessions, etc?\u201d\n\nA: At this stage, we are allowing labs, studios, and pracs to continue as normal for as long as feasibly possible.\n\nQ: \u201cThere is an FAQ on the student section of the University\u2019s Coronavirus webpage that reads: \u201cI have been tested and diagnosed as having coronavirus. What should I do?\u201d The answer reads: Call your supervisor and People and Wellbeing and submit a request for sick leave.\u201d - can you clarify this?\u201d\n\nA: I will take that as an action-on-notice - it shouldn\u2019t read like that \u200b- this is being fixed ASAP. \u200bRather it should read something like: \"Please follow the guidance of Queensland Health or your doctor. If possible, please let Student Connect or a member of staff know, so we can manage cleaning, isolation etc. However, if you are a tutor or staff member as well as a student then do follow that advice.\n\nQ: \u201cIs the university waiting for a diagnosis on campus before moving to the next stage?\u201d\n\nA: No, by rolling out the plans this week we are trying our best to stay ahead of the curve and reduce the likelihood of community transmission on campus.\u201d\n\nQ: Will you consider pushing back census date by a week so students waiting for details aren\u2019t pushed to deferring?\n\nA: \u201cRight now, I don\u2019t think we can. However, we \u200bwill can be flexible with late withdrawal applications without financial or academic penalty, depending on your circumstances.\"\n\nQ: Someone commented on a forum: I\u2019ve had the symptoms for 2 weeks but I can't get tested because I haven't travelled anywhere. need widespread tests, none of this targeted testing.\u201d Do Griffith Health services have the testing equipment available and if so, will they be willing to test students who have symptoms?\n\nA: \u201cNo, we don\u2019t have the equipment or a diagnostic lab \u200bto carry out testing, but our doctors can assess whether you are at risk and refer you for testing \u200bif you are at risk. However, if you are feeling symptomatic, please stay at home and call your GP\u200b or 13Health.\u201d\n\nHave a good night!\n\n[Griffith Stalker Space post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1116681258431725/permalink/2360904404009398/)",

They still haven't sent the email out though.\n\nFor me I wonder what the hell the Guild and the Mt Gravatt / South Bank / Logan SRC execs have been doing...\n\nEDIT (11:00am 17/3): Emails are now being sent out alphabetically, it may take some time to send all of them. Can confirm have just received email. \n\nTo quote from email: \n\n&gt; This week we have:\n\n&gt; * ceased all face-to-face lectures for classes with greater than 300 students enrolled. If you are in a large class, you will receive notification that your face-to-face lectures have been replaced with online lectures\n\n&gt; * commenced work to move smaller lectures to remote delivery for the start of next week.  No lectures will be delivered face to face after this Friday.\n\n&gt; Over the following two-three weeks we will: \n\n&gt; * work to move tutorials and workshops to remote/online delivery modes before the end of the mid-trimester break, to be ready for the resumption of teaching on 14 April\n\n&gt; * continue to deliver laboratories, clinics, work-integrated-learning etc that cannot be delivered online, but review how we could move these forward or delay them in the event of campus closures\nadjust the timing of or modify assessment for online delivery in case end of trimester exams can\u2019t be run on campus\n\n&gt; * take a flexible approach to assessment practices such as extending time for non-submitted assessment, special consideration, submission of medical certificates and awarding supplementary assessment for students due to graduate in trimester 1 2020\n\n&gt; * postponing the academic standing round until the conclusion of trimester 2 2020.",

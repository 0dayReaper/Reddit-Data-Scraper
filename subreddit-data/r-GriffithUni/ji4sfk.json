    "postText": "Hey guys... I've got an offer to start the Bachelor of Aviation Management in March of 2021. I'm a graduate of a college here in Canada and have applied my credits so I can complete the Bachelors in 1 year. I've got a few questions for anyone who would be able to help...\n\n1. Are Griffith degrees widely accepted in Canada and/or worldwide?\n2. How flexible is the online study module? Has anyone done online studying and worked full-time? What's it like?\n\nThanks in advance for anyone who can help!",

Griffith is considered to be in the top 3% of university\u2019s worldwide for what that\u2019s worth\n\nAs for the work/study thing. It\u2019s probably going to be tough to work and study full time. Likely you\u2019ll need to do one part time. The online study is pretty good. All lectures are recorded, and if your class in online then the workshop will be recorded too. However, some classes aren\u2019t offered online (at least during normal non corona times), so only the lectures are recorded in those classes as far as I\u2019m aware",

The amount and quality of education you will get in Australia is much less/worse than the US but only slightly less quantity and lower standards than Canada.",

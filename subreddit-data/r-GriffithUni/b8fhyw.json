    "postText": "So I never chose a major in my first year at uni, because I was unaware that I had to. I thought it was something that only happened at college in America. \n\nHow can I make myself have a major? When I go to select add a major now there\u2019s no options there. MyGriffith won\u2019t let me select one now. \n\nI\u2019m doing a Bachelor of Criminology and Criminal Justice if that helps. ",

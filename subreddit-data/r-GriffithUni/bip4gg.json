    "postText": "Hey guys!\n\nSo I\u2019m looking at coming to Griffith Gold Coast next year and after seeing my friend down in Newcastle and his on campus living I\u2019m interested in what Griffith on campus living is like. I never considered in until now but I\u2019m strongly wanting his experience. He\u2019s always meeting new people and has a wide group of friends from his level and college campus. There is constantly parties and events organised for his campus, what\u2019s Griffith kind of like?\nCheers for anyone taking the time to answer, really appeciate it!",

That being said, it can get very, very loud so if you\u2019re a person that enjoys quiet study space I would maybe consider going elsewhere, especially on the weekends but if you\u2019re a party person then this is the place to be!",

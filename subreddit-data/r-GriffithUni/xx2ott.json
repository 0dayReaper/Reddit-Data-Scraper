    "postText": "Hello Everyone,\n\nSo I just got accepted into Griffith University, for their Master of Environment program. Anyone here in the program or graduated from it? Would love to connect.\n\nHowever, the main purpose of this post is to familiarize myself a little with the locals of Brisbane. Get a gist of what is like living there, the weather, the night life, how you like it and yeah basically any advice you would give someone moving there for their further studies.\n\nA little background, I did my undergrad in Canada in Marine Biology and I have always wanted to live and work in Australia perhaps, due to its incredible landscape and scenic oceans (I watched a lot of Youngbloods) I am a pretty outgoing lad, love breweries, going out, adventuring and I am also a huge environmental enthusiast. I am super stocked to be taking this new step in my life and would love to hear from you guys about anything!",

It\u2019s also a hell of a lot of fun.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to study IT, and intend to do nothing other than attend classes (no clubs, parties, sports, guilds, etc) then maybe give it a miss?",

I did it because having a degree had a clear use for me, and then it progressed into actually needing it for my profession of choice (rather than a stepping stone). \n\nI guess the question you've got to ask yourself is whether it \\~is\\~ worth the cost. The changes to HECS is fucking shit so you'll be paying your degree back on a lower income bracket, so you've got to consider whether the degree will be worth it, or what the use of getting it is. There's a ton a reasons to go to university, but the one that I think is ill advised is \"unsure about what to do\". This will just suck up time and your HECS debt until you have an idea about what you want to do.",

In this case, would you consider going and having to chat to a career advisor or something? Even potentially scoping out what GU has that interests you (or any university really, although I'm doing postgrad here I feel no particular loyalty to GU).\n\nIt could be because I'm part of Health group, but I don't feel that every health profession is \"too hard\", rather it's going to be a challenge basically forever (and that's why I'm attracted to my field). It does sound like there's a fair bit of uncertainty, so make sure you check out a range of possibilities, and see what takes your fancy.",

Keep in mind that what you do right now doesn't, and probably won't, be the thing that defines you forever. Choosing to do something might allow you to really validate something which you find interesting, or let you know what you definitely don't want to pursue. The real challenge is actually getting your foot in the door at university, but once you are in, it's easier to stay in.\n\nYou also might want to consider why the USQ thing didn't work out in the first place (lack of interest, mindset, etc.). I almost always recommend people take a year or a few off before commencing university, as many of us don't have the maturity/mindset for university study straight out of high school (I know I needed time away before I came back to complete my degree). University isn't a race, it's more of an endurance event, but there is a ton of support at GU (I tutor a course at GU), so I am aware of the support services for students.",

    "postText": "Current business &amp; finance uni student here who started mid-year 2017 (2nd trimester intake). Hoping to offer some of my personal tips for prospective new students commencing Feb 26:\n\n- Ease into study. \n\n- When you leave campus for the day, I'd avoid any study work unless it's of content you quite don't understand. \n\n- If travelling on public transport, if you want to, just do some quick light research on what it is you're not understanding, like things as simple as wikipedia pages. \n\n- Know where your limit is, in that, if you're at the point of procrastination where everything you need to do is just annoying, don't continue. Break the study up. Be it 5 - 10 minutes. It still counts. \n\n- If you know you're behind and you've got days off between classes &amp; lectures, go either to the library or even somewhere where you can just hammer out the work that suits your tastes. Only enough that **you** think is enough to be on par. That may be either on track with what each week's lecture about or what **you** believe is enough to properly understand the concepts.\n \n- When studying, what ever helps to get you relaxed, do that in breaks (you choose how long your breaks are though).\n \n- When you get home, reduce your gaming time if you can (e.g. spend some extra time on off days when you're satisfied you've caught up).\n\n- Avoid being hungry when studying. Same with being dehydrated. \n\n- If you feel as if working under pressure does well to help focus, set dates where you'd want to do that before due dates for things like written assessments, study for exams. Add extra days to subjects you feel you're stuck on. It will help to avoid the last tip. \n\n*some extra uni tips*\n\n- Check out the [student representative council](https://www.facebook.com/griffithsrc/) (or [The Student Guild](https://www.facebook.com/GUGCStudentGuild/)  for the Gold Coast campus) on what promotions and deals you can get for things like food. Note that every campus has a separate student representative council. Furthermore, the Student Guild is a completely separate student representative council for the Gold Coast / Southport campus.\n\n- Every week throughout semester, the SRC will host free food days where food trucks will come on campus and students can queue for free food. Get in early however as the wait times can be up to 30min.\n\n- Every university student receives a free copy of Microsoft Office for the duration of their degree program. See [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/education/students/default.aspx) for details. Basically just log into your student email from the Microsoft Office Education page (it will lead you to log in with your s-Number) and go from there. \n\n- Research at uni is more complex than what it was in high school.\n\n- Feel your research skills may be falling short or feels as if it's not really answering the question? I hope you've got a good study skills handbook. (*I'd recommend [The Study Skills handbook by S. Cottrell](https://www.coop.com.au/the-study-skills-handbook/9781137289254) and [Critical Thinking Skills:  Developing Effective Analysis and Argument](https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Thinking-Skills-Developing-Effective/dp/0230285295))*. I use both. \n\n- If you can, if there's people within your tutes you kinda connect with, see if you can catch up with them and ask if they'll hang out for study sessions. Personally for me, these help in understanding ideas and what you have to focus on. \n\n- Please, please, **PLEASE** read the marking sheet &amp; marking criteria before planning for your assignment. It is what lecturers, tutors will be marking your assessments against and explains what you need to have put into your assessment to pass.\n\nLastly, \n**a couple of cups of coffee and an all-nighter can write up a decent essay or report overnight but it won't help in the long term.**\n\nGood luck and just ease into uni with some preparation.",

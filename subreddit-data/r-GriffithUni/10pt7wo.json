    "postText": "My payments for University Village Campus start on February 13th, but I will be arriving in the beginning of march, so I will be paying almost a month before I arrive. I contacted them and they told me I can\u2019t change the start date of my stay, but I am wondering are there any other solutions? For example to push the start to march 1 and the contract to be valid longer? Or are there any other options?",

I\u2019d recommend just paying for those 4 weeks. I know it sucks, but they have a wait list and lots of people ready to take your place and the pushing out 4 weeks at the end won\u2019t really work for them.",

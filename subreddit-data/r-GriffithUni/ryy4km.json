    "postText": "Hi everyone I\u2019m starting a bachelor of design at Griffith College of Art in Brisbane (Southbank), and was wondering if some of you would be willing to answer some of my questions (P.S some of them are weird). \n\nFirst of all just so you know I graduated year 12 this is and I\u2019m quite a shy person.\n\n1. In lectures, tutorials, seminars and studio classes, do you just sit with people you don\u2019t know on the first day or are people friends already?\n\n2. What happens exactly during o-week? I\u2019m a little confused\n\n3. Should I be early to my classes and if so how early? (do classes start when it says it starts on the timetable or is there a period for students to enter)\n\n4. Does it matter where I sit?\n\n5. Is it easy to make friends with people?\n\nThese are all the questions I can think of now. I really appropriate anyone who can answer my questions. I always get nervous when going somewhere without people I already know, so I might ask them questions or at least just have someone I already know. \n\nOnce again thank you.",

O-week is to met new people find out more information and general make you less confused. I found it great to get a general feel for uni and my degree. \n3. Lectures generally start on time, but it depends on the lecturer. I try to be a couple of minutes early so I can sit were I want and chat to friends. \n4. Nope sit anywhere \n5. Yes very easy, because the people in your degree are normally very likeminded. \n\nI recommend joining the Facebook communities. You can be alerted to things that are going on. My degree has its own page. \n\nI know it\u2019s hard starting somewhere new and there is a lot of uncertainty but a Bachelor of design sounds really fun. I hope you really enjoy your degree.",

As a lecturer at griffith I have a few recommendations to make your life easier. \n\n1. Classes end 10~15min before the hour so feel free to just come in the room 5min before your class starts. Don't just stand outside waiting for somebody to let you in.\n\n2. It's not high-school, please don't ask me if you can go to the bathroom. Just go. \n\n3. Nobody cares if you have your phone. You can text in any class, just keep it on silent. (I have kicked many students out of my class for having their phone sound on, though obviously forgetting it)\n\n4. Come to every class (unless you are sick) the students that struggle the most in my classes are the ones that miss the classes. Seems obvious but it happens a lot. \n\n5. Put your god damn name on your assignments!!!\n\n6. Get a swipe card! It costs about $100 but you get the money back when you graduate.\n\n7. No uni course will get you a job. It's for teaching you skills. Start applying for companies even when you are in first year! Even if you don't have the skills. Start applying! \n\nThere are more things but these are the ones that come to mind. Good luck in your class! First year is the hardest, but you got this!",

I do film so it was like equipment demonstrations, a screening and some talks and im sure the other courses there are run similar. You just show up to the campus opposite South Bank Station and from there they\u2019ll show you around probably after an orientation talk in the lecture theatre. Some of my friends will be the mentors this year and they\u2019re all lovely people! Dont be afraid to ask them any questions.",

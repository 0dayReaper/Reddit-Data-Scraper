    "postText": "Hi all. I am wondering where I\u2019d find a list to tell me what I need for my degree, doesn\u2019t seem to be under the explanation/details of my degree. Wondering if the university suggests I have a laptop or not and if so what specs do I need etc? Doing a Double major of business/international tourism and hospitality. Thanks in advance",

Student Mentor here.\n\nRegarding tech, what I would suggest is: \n\n\n1) Wait until your degree specific presentations at O-Week before you go and drop $10K on\u00a0an Apple setup to be advised that the software you will be using is not compatible with that product.\u00a0 \n\n\n2) Go through your degree program and see what classes you may want to take throughout your time here. You can also access most previous course profiles. \n\nLook at the Assessments section and you may be able to make an educated guess on what you will be needing and what works best for you. \n\n3) Go to the \"Fees\" section of the Degree profile and see if there is anything listed under\u00a0Additional Fee Information.\n\n\nRegarding textbooks and stationery: \n\nTo see what textbooks you will require head to [Griffith Uni Reading Lists](https://www.griffith.edu.au/library/teaching/reading-lists) and type in the course code. \n\nIf you need a textbook, you can go on the Griffith University Textbook Exchange page on Facebook for pre-loved books at a fraction of the price of a new one. There are also pre-loved uniforms available (like lab coats, nurses uniforms, scrubs, etc.) \nYou can also go to the library and borrow them for the Trimester.  \n\nYou can also go to [The School Locker ](https://theschoollocker.com.au/universities/griffith-university) to purchase new books, uniforms and stationary. During peak times, it is advised to pre-order and pick up your goods on campus when you are notified (via your student email) \n\nSome course convenors have enabled online versions of the required or recommended textbooks\n\nMy advice would be to speak to previous students in your course and see how they went about getting textbooks, and the frequency they used them. Also, attend your lectures in Week 1 and speak with the course convenors, and your tutors from week 2.",

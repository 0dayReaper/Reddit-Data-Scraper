My daughter is planning on going to Griffith when she graduates and will need to earn a bit of money to support herself. Obviously, things are different right now with Coronavirus so just talking generally!",

Once she's officially enrolled at Griffith, ask the admin centre how she can do that and they'll show her where to go. \n\n\n\n***please note: Unitemps advertise lots of CASUAL work. It is not consistent. And it's a first in basis as usually you're rostered with hundreds of other students.",

Just reply here again once she's in and I'll pop a few tips.",

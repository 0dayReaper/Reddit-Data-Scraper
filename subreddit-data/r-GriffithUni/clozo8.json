Since you are an Australian citizen, you aren't an international student.\n\nHowever, when I did the same degree in 2011 there were English language proficiency tests that had to be passed before you could graduate, but not required for entry. They were very easy though, all the questions were taken from a pool that was available online, kind of like an L plate test. Definitely not as hard as something like IELTS.",

How many CPs is recommended for each Trimester? (I\u2019m a freshman in Bachelor btw) \n\nQ2. Is there any fixed amount of class I should enroll per courses or majors?\n\nQ3. What is the difference between course and major??",

            "comment": "I graduated with a Bachelor of Business from Griffith University recently so I'll try and to be helpful to you.\n\nA1. It's completely dependent on how quick you want to complete your degree. If you're a full-time student, 30 CP is the lowest you're allowed to take in a trimester, while 50 CP is the most you're allowed to take WITHOUT getting permission to take more classes. With permission, the maximum permitted is 60 CP.\n\nI'd say the recommended is probably 40 CP. It's manageable for most and will get you out of university within a reasonable amount of time. I personally took 40 CP most of the time, with 30 CP and 60 CP chucked in here and there.\n\nA2. There will be mandatory classes that you will need to take that build the foundation of your degree. You will also need to take the mandatory classes that build your major/non-major.\n\nA3. A course is simply a 'class' (although a class is something else). On average, your degree will require you to take 24 courses (240 CP) as one requirement before graduating.\n\nA major is a collection of courses that are similar in theme. If your degree is a Bachelor of Business and you happen to like finance (ew), you'd probably select finance to be your major. Your finance major would then be made up of about six courses (classes) that have to do with finance.\n\nI'll try and clarify further if required. I hope I helped!",

For example [https://www.griffith.edu.au/study/degrees/bachelor-of-business-1632#degree-details](https://www.griffith.edu.au/study/degrees/bachelor-of-business-1632#degree-details)  you need to pick the tab at the top DEGREE DETAILS when you plan to start and your major. Then look at COURSE LISTS. It tells you exactly what to take and in what order.Follow the list.  4 is the normal number every trimester. Course is the degree you get major is specialization in that. Are you going to orientation? They will help you there",

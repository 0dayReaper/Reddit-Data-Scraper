    "postText": "Hey guys, sorry im actually at a different aus uni, but I wanted to ask if anyone had any experience with appealing to the uni appeals committee.\n\nI'm in a really heartbreaking situation where I crossed the 25% non-attendance threshold at my medical school, and now am not permitted to sit the final exam. I asked for a review of the decision, but they still said no. Now I have to appeal this, and I am scared to hell. I don't have a chance to re-do the year or anything, this really is it. The reasons I crossed it is because I was really sick the start of term, and also got covid middle of the term. We have compulsory lectures as well. I've had mental health struggles during this year, and had a similar problem with attendance last term, which is why I am so ashamed of myself for not fixing this.",

            "comment": "Hey! I found this from your newer post. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this and everything else from the past year, there are some really insensitive people on your new post. I\u2019m a third year med student at UTAS and they are extremely understanding of mental health concerns for all of their students, especially med students. There were a number of people in my grade who had to take time off for themselves and if it had been too long, the uni granted them to repeat the year, however, you only have a time limit of 7 years for the 5-year degree. So as long as you\u2019re within that time frame, they just let you repeat without asking too many questions. I don\u2019t see why your university would be against you repeating, if they are only worried about attendance.\n\nOn the other hand, all your reasons for leave are valid. You\u2019re in first year of med, you learn to handle stress over the course of the degree, that\u2019s why it\u2019s such a long path. You\u2019re not expected to know how to be a doctor in your first year. That\u2019s something you learn in the degree. A good doctor is one who has compassion and resilience, which you do. I wish you all the best and I hope your university lets you repeat the year.",

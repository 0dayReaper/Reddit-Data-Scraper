    "postText": "Hello I am an international student and I am trying to enroll to 3 courses for trimester 1 2023. In one of the courses all the time slots for workshops are full and I am not sure what to do. Can I still chose the full time slot and just enroll and figure it out later? Also for the other 2 courses I have some overlapping with one course and one workshop. Can I just enroll and switch workshop time slots later?",

Usually with a button-up shirt, but definitely a t-shirt some days like Fridays, or when I have no meetings.  My footwear is exclusively Converse or Doc Martens.\n\nBut admittedly I am also among the more casually dressed.  I don't really care about those sort of things so much though, especially in a University environment.  It is one of the things about academia - nobody will call you out on your dress sense, they'll just bitch and criticise you behind your back instead, so you'll never know.",

Once you\u2019ve been there a week you will get a better feel if your team is more on the causal side (jeans,etc.) or not. Miss Louie on YouTube has some great smart causal / business outfit inspo. I used to get nice work tops from Myer.",

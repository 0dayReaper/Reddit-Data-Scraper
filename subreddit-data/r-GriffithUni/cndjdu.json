    "postText": "Any medical students out there?  I'm Canadian and I've just beed accepted to Griffith , but I'm still waiting to hear back from other universities. I really like the concept of Griffith's medical program, but the interview seemed a little unprofessional compared to other schools, so I'm trying to judge the quality of the program...\n\nIt's a new program so I would love to hear what anyone has to say about it, likes and dislikes, to decide if it's worth the investment to pay the deposit and accept while I wait to hear back from other schools.\n\nThanks for all your thoughts :)!",

Don\u2019t know the ins and outs but met a few people who transferred and said it was really easy. That could be an option to consider.",

Yeah I still might get accepted elsewhere but to hold my place at Griffith I would loose 6000 CAD so was hoping to get some student experience perspectives to know what the program is like :)",

    "postText": "Hey guys, international student here thinking about studying the above Double degree but I have a few questions\n\n- is there an option to take a minor with this in preferably health so I have a foot in that door? (I can\u2019t seem to find minors on the Griffith website) \n\n- is there work integrated learning? What are the job prospects in and out of Australia for this field, and how was it for you? \n\n- how is the coarse load? I\u2019ve never done this before and previously had only uptaken life sciences. Do I have to know any material before hand? \n\nThanks a bunch!",

            "comment": "Hey mate, I\u2019m not in the data science/business double degree but was looking at transferring from the computer science degree this year so I do know the data science/business degree is very new at Griffith. The first intake of students was Trimester 2 2019 so you\u2019ll find it hard to find anyone that\u2019s actually in it let alone far enough through to answer your questions.\n\nIn regards to course load we have 3 trimesters so you can split your 8 subjects across the 3 trimesters instead of 2 to lessen the load but still complete in the same amount of time. Just means that you won\u2019t get a 4 month break between November and March.\n\nThe only subject you would need prior knowledge of is Linear Algebra, but if your level of maths isn\u2019t great they get you to do Foundation maths instead of an elective in Year 1.\n\nAs for job prospects, demand for data science/business intelligence jobs has only started increasing in Australia in the last couple of years so I don\u2019t believe you would have much trouble finding work once you complete your degree.\n\nHope that helps somewhat.",

I've heard its pretty dead. Would you recommend changing uni instead? Pysch honours if that helps.",

I could easily be incorrect however.\n\nThe good news is that Nathan is extremely close to Mt Gravatt campus. So close I genuinely wonder why they even made two campuses so close together AND you can take a free Uni run shuttle between them.\n\nEven while you are at Mt Gravatt, I would recommend taking the shuttle to Nathan during spare time to check it out.",

Yes the \u2018bigger\u2019 names and convenors are located at Gold Coast but having just gone through the program I am super grateful I stayed at MG. Ended up with a supervisor I hadn\u2019t even thought of who was amazing and there were a lot of great projects happening from that campus. Also from my understanding, yes MG will be moving to Nathan but that date is not set. As a post grad student there now and seasonal academic, from what I have heard it won\u2019t be next year so I wouldn\u2019t stress to much about it yet.",

    "postText": " I have 80 credit points left to go in my degree, which I need to stretch out over 3 trimesters at Griffith University (T2 2019, T1 2020, and T2 2020). I am receiving centrelink.\n\nIf I undertake 30 credit points (3 classes worth) for each remaining trimester to meet the minimum full-time standard for receiving centrelink, I will still be short in my last trimester where I will only have 20 credit points of classes left to do. Therefore I will be classed as part-time and will lose payments.\n\nDoes anyone know if I am able to take on an ADDITIONAL elective class (10 credit points), regardless of already fulfilling the minimum amount of credit points by then that's required for graduation? (320 all up, IF I pass all classes at that point).\n\nWill centrelink evaluate my enrollment status and determine that I am taking on 1 class too many? So instead of doing 320 total credit points, I could do 330. Which would mean each remaining trimester I am doing 30 credit points, and full-time study.\n\nThank you for any guidance, from a concerned student.",

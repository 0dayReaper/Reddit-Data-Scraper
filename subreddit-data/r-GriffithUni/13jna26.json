    "postText": "So Griffith University offers a Bachelors degree in Pharmacology and Toxicology. It goes for 3-4 years and it\u2019s something I\u2019m super interested in. I\u2019m more interested in the pharmacology side but I\u2019d also be happy studying toxicology as a future career in a hospital. \n\nI was wondering if anyone has done/in the process of completing this course and can answer some questions. \n\n- I know there\u2019s a difference between pharmacy and pharmacology. What about career prospects in Australia? I don\u2019t really want to be working retail so is there a possibility I could work in a lab studying the effects of [new] drugs/medicines? \neg. Clinical trials \n\n- I have only completed biology in my senior school. I know it\u2019s a lot of chemistry and physiology. Would I need to do bridging courses before I apply for the bachelor or do they teach them in first year? \n\n- and for anyone who\u2019s completed a pharmacology or toxicology degree, what does a day in the lab look like for you? Is it worth it? \n\nThanks!",

So they took up a lot of my time in that first year, but I ended up teaching the labs/tutorials for chemistry\n\nThey generally offer lots of tutorials and help for people who may not be familiar with it but I would recommend getting a head start on learning on khan academy or something so that you're not overwhelmed\n\nThe advice I give to people starting out is that most degrees except very specific occupational degrees (Pharmacy, OT, Dietetics) is that your bachelor should be treated as a stepping stone degree to something post graduate. So really try and get your GPA as high as possible so that you have as many options as possible if you want to change career directions at the end.",

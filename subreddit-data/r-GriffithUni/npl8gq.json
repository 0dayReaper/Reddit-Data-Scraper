    "postText": "Hi there! \n\nI am a prospective student from Singapore, planning to embark on a Bachelor's Degree in International Tourism &amp; Hotel Management with Griffith through the online campus. As I had a diploma in tourism and resort management from Singapore, I saw the credit transfer calculator and it says that with my diploma I can finish the program in 1 year (80 CP). Does anyone have any idea which modules I have to take to complete the 80 CP? Contacted the course director and she forwarded my email to the International Students Team and got a very generic reply that doesn't answer my question. So I am very confused... Also, any idea on the online campus (fully flexible) experience? Do you have to attend live online classes or is all the lectures and tutorial uploaded online for viewing at our own time? \n\nIf anyone has had similar experiences, your kind advice is appreciated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

Keep in mind, I\u2019m in the School of ICT (Bachelor in IT) so not sure how this differs for other degrees. \n\nI\u2019ve found that most of my lecturers have recorded lectures you can view at your own time and LIVE lectures you can attend (through Microsoft Teams). Most highly suggest you attend both. \n\nWith tutorials, common times, workshops etc. you can attend those LIVE as well (usually through BlackBoard). But I find most of the time they are recorded and you can watch them at a later date. However, they very much encourage to attend the LIVE workshop/lab/tutorial instead of watching the recorded one later.\n\nHope that helps :)",

            "comment": "Hey, I'm taking the same program and about to start my final year. Can't answer your 1st question because it depends on what you're getting credit for. Year 2 and 3 courses are mixed so you can do them in either year so it depends on what you've already completed at your school and how it matches up to Australia's course outline. Which course director did you talk to? There's one who isn't very helpful and she messed up my stuff, I had to request someone new to help me and Rebecca Cox was great. See if you can get her to help you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Currently doing everything online since I got stuck in Canada during Covid and see a big difference between their online and in-person courses. Personally I think online is hit and miss for this program and not really worth the money, I'm only doing it because I have 2 semesters left and want to finish as soon as possible instead of waiting until I can get back to Australia. The lectures and workshops are done live for most classes but they're recorded so if you miss them you can watch them later. Some are uploaded within an hour of the class finishing, some don't upload until a few days later. Some classes have no lectures at all, you watch unit videos or read case studies then attend the workshops to discuss them.  Some of the power point slides aren't well done; they have spelling errors, flip between British and American English,  aren't grammatically correct or don't have all the info on the slide and it's at the bottom of the page so you need to remember to scroll down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnline attendance doesn't matter for the classes I've done so far, the other poster said that it mattered in their course so it seems different depending on the subject. Many students aren't in Australia and the teachers know this, they just say to make sure you attend if you're struggling or need to ask a question because it's easier for them to answer instead of you messaging them. Each module has 3 or 4 assessments, a mix of group presentations, individual assignments, mid-semester exam or quiz and final exam.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny other questions just ask :)",

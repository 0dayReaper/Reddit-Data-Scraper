    "postText": "Hi, this is my first time posting on this kind of sub so I apologise if I do anything wrong. I'm gonna be starting at Griffith Film School (Southbank campus) this year.\n\nI'm also transgender (ftm). I have come out to my parents in the past, but they weren't entirely supportive and are seemingly in denial over it, despite the fact that I came out in 2017. Everytime I try to bring it up in conversation, they either get mad or shut me down. They don't seem transphobic, and it appears to come from a place of genuine concern, but at this point I'm too scared to even bring up the topic because I know it'll only end in heartbreak and then they'll just pretend it never happened.\n\nThey also refused to let me come out at school - which in hindsight is fair enough, high school is brutal. But I want to be more open at uni, I want to be able to use my preferred name and pronouns. Is there a way I can go about this without my parents finding out? Is there a certain staff member I should talk to? I know I can change my preferred name on myGriffith but at the moment my mum has been going on there a lot to help me sort out orientation stuff and I worry that if I ask her not to, she'll want to know why.\n\nI should also add that I do want to ask my psychiatrist for advice regarding this situation, but I don't know when I'll be able to next have an appointment since I'm currently still reliant on my parents (and also I want to maybe try and have them there for part of it so they'd have to come along anyway).\n\nTLDR: does anybody have any advice for being more openly trans at uni and using my preferred name and pronouns without my parents finding out?",

            "comment": "Um, sorry, god that sounds like an awful situation, but aside from just telling the people you meet your actual name and gender identity, I'm not sure there's much you can do. Griffith does make it fairly simple to change your preferred name and title etc but, if your parents are still accessing all your stuff they will see it.\n\nThe, best I can suggest is, if there's any way you can separate from your parents at all. You'd probably be able to be supported by Centrelink Student Youth Allowance (and I believe you can explain to them that living at home isn't safe due to how your parents don't accept you), but you would need some way to be looked after in the mean time whilst all that paperwork goes through, and, I'm not even sure how that bit works honestly. And that's absolutely a huge step either way.\n\nSo um, yeah, at best you might be able to find comfort with any friends you make here (as long as you let them know not to tell your parents), but, if you can't change anything in the system then I'm not sure what else you could do.",

However I would suggest getting into contact with your convenors, tutors/PASS leaders, advisers etc and just shooting them an email explaining your situation and asking them to refer to you by your proper name and pronouns instead of what's on your file. Or if your parents have access to your student email, talk to your tutors in person if you have on campus classes this tri. \n\nEither way, good luck!",

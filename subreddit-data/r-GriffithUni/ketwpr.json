I\u2019m kind of interested either Griffith or Murdoch but I\u2019ve heard bad experience in Murdoch. I know it\u2019s pretty biased to ask but is Griffith a good school. Not from an international student perspective but in general.",

There are far fewer lecturers now and the library staff seems to have been particularly decimated. The Australian government cut the funding to universities so arts students now pay 100% of the cost themselves. This means that the university and government have 0 investment in you doing well or graduating. Whatever happens, they get the tuition money.",

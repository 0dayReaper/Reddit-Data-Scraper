If you're studying a different level, please check the course profile. \n\nIt is an 80 credit point degree that will be completed over 2 years part-time meaning you would  probably study 20 CP on average per semester. Under your [course list](https://degrees.griffith.edu.au/Program/8025/Courses/Domestic#degree-requirements) you can get a better idea of how much CP each course is. You might for example, want to study Japanese 1A and Japanese Society and Pop Culture in Semester 1 which would be 20CP. \n\nI recommend pawing over the course list and thinking about how you want to structure your degree. The guideline is 20CP per semester. ",

            "comment": "current second year undergrad with this major, the study load for diploma according to a classmate who is doing the diploma is about 20CP or about 7-8hrs of class time per week (so a language class, 2 classes per week lasting 2hrs each, plus a different japanese-related subject) as far as I know. \n\nTextbook &amp; workbook for both 1A and 1B is Genki 1: An Integrated Course in Elementary Japanese Eri Banno et al. At co-op, cost is about $80 together. By the time you finish 1B the whole book will be complete. \n\nHomework wise, for 1A/B is about 5-6 hrs of both workbook exercises and self-guided practice (e.g. kanji study and repitition, grammar and vocab), maybe more or less depending if you have previous knowledge. Assessment is split up between set homework to be completed by next class (split over 12 weeks, so around 3-4 pages per class, or 8 pages per week, 10% of marks), timed quizzes (20% of marks), one speaking examination (25% of marks) and a final exam amounting for the remaining 45% of marks. \n\n2A/B a little more, probably 9-10 hrs of study, in which would be even more if you do 2A/B enhanced which includes completing a portfolio of work &amp; attending an extra 1hr seminar on top of the 4-hrs of face-to-face class. Speaking examination(s) and final exam. \n\nTextbook / workbook for 2A?: Genki II by Eri Banno,\n\nUnsure about 3A (which is required at end as amounts for 20CP). I would recommend you look up the program director / course convenor in the course profile and email for further information. \n\nI\u2019d recommend getting Anki flashcards for pc / or pay $39 for the iOS app, and start doing the Core 2K Kanji deck on their website. r/LearnJapanese would also be good for questions on stuff.",

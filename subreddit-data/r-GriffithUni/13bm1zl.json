    "postText": "Hey guys, I will be coming to Griffith as an international student this third Trimester.\nI am very interested in meeting locals and experience the true life there. So my question are:\n1. How hard is it to meet locals as an international if you try (clubs, events etc.)\n2. Are there campus events often and are they well visited?\n3. How is the student life there?",

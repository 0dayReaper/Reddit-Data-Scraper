    "postText": "Howdy!  \n\n\nLast year I did Business and Design as a Double Degree. I decided to drop out of Business, but continue on with Design. I got a credit transfer of 50cp of 230cp. I have a couple of questions about how my course will work.  \n\n\nSince I have completed the majority of first-year classes, I have really small trimesters and even some 'empty' ones were there isn't anything I can enroll in, unless I repeat the course. I currently have some design major electives down, which are worth 10cp each. Next Trimester, I do have 2 courses I didn't complete last year due to some classes being cut due to it being a part of a double degree.  \n\n\nI was thinking of enrolling in classes for Year Two, but those are listed only as two major electives worth 40cp each. The electives I have down now are only worth 10cp, but I am unsure how I could enrol myself in them when they are 40cp in Year One, or if I have to wait out until next year. The only classes I have besides electives are Year 3 classes which I'm not too confident in enrolling in just yet. \n\n  \nSo my questions are:  \n\n\n1. Is there anyway to enrol myself in the Second Year 40cp Electives? I have the choice of the same exact electives, the only difference is if I do it this year, I get 10cp each, but if I do it next year, I get 40cp each (for two). Is there anyway I can do the 40cp this year?\n2. Since I am doing 3 electives this Trimester, will they count towards my third year electives? For example, if I do them this year, will I still have to do electives in my third year, or do the Credit Points received count towards that, regardless of year?\n3. If I don't do any classes for Trimester One, will that effect anything like being a full-time student? Would I have to apply for something to have that trimester off? I'm not too willing to have to do this, if I can work towards CP that count towards Year 3 electives now.\n4. Is a course completed once all Credit Points have been achieved? I'll have an extra 30cp at the end if I follow the subjects by year. So would I be able to finish early if I did the subjects and didn't do the 'extra' electives?\n\nI hope this all makes sense, since I don't really understand it myself at the moment. Thanks heaps!",

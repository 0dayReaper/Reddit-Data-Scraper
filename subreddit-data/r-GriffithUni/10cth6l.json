            "comment": "I\u2019m a Bach of Business student and did intro to applied psych as one of my 1st year elective I had to choose from. \nI did really well, if the assessment plan is still the same, it was very manageable with a weekly workbook that had questions relating to that weeks content, each week did get progressively harder, but very manageable. \nThe content is definitely easily applied to business but I also found it help me out a lot personally. \nThere isn\u2019t to much of the clinical psychological theories, just enough to give background understanding so you can then apply it I guess. \n\nHope this helps",

But it is a first yr course so it will be very scaffolded and designed as a beginner entry course which is very promising. Additionally the convenor (Darren Wishart) is wonderful from my experience. He is very approachable and provides a lot of support. Have you had a look at the course profile yet and that may give you an indication of previous students feedback and also what the assessments will look like",

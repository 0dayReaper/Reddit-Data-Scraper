    "postText": "- Really unorganised staff. I had no Uni representative given to me on my prac just 'cause'. \n- Unmotivated tutors. \n- Lazy assessment - E.g. Read this random book in one week than 'reflect' on it. No further guidance given. \n- Units seem unrelated to my course - I study education. The little amount of actual study devoted to classroom situations or techniques is staggering. \n- Whenever there is a problem it is impossible to get in touch with someone - E.g. I had to ring my department and I was palmed off to another staff member six times because 'this isn't really my area, but Sally will be able to help you'. \n- No communication between units - E.g. I reached my 2nd year and no one had taught us lesson planning yet (in an education course) because they all assumed the other units had done it. Also, we had one semester where two units both expected us to read a novel a week. They could not understand why everyone was so behind in our reading. \n- General dissatisfaction amongst the student cohort - Everyone hates QUT and is a grumpy mood all the time. \n- Little to no student events or clubs/societies.\n- Dingy buildings which makes it look more like juvenile detention centre than a Uni.\nI could go on... You get the gist. I go to the Kelvin Grove campus btw. \n\n ",

    "postText": "I\u2019m looking to apply for a bachelor of computer science and and saw the AEA aptitude test that I will have to take. I don\u2019t know much about engineering or computer science and have no idea what the test is really about. If someone could tell me topics to start studying in advance and how hard is it, or any information that would be greatly appreciated. ",

    "postText": "I just finished my first semester with a WAM of 77.00 (bachelor of science at Melbourne University) \u2013 I'm aware that this isn't competitive enough to get into Bachelor of Dental Science, but I was wondering if anyone knew what WAM I should be aiming for to get an equivalent of a 6.85 GPA (which I understand is the ideal goal to be accepted into this course). \n\nDentistry is my career goal, but recently I've been worried that I'm not smart enough to even get into the profession. But if there a slight possibility for me to improve my WAM to an equivalent of a 6.85 GPA - I'm determined to work hard for it. \n\nSo please, can anyone give me some insight?",

But essentially, to get a 6.85 GPA, you need to be aiming for above 85% in most courses (or probably slightly higher to make up for the lower WAM this semester). \n\n\nHope that helps! And if anyone has corrections fire away, this is just my best attempt",

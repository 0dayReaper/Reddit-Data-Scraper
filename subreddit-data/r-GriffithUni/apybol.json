            "comment": "Keep in mind that far fewer courses are offered in trimester three (which is our version of QUT\u2019s and UQ\u2019s summer semester). Trimester three also isn\u2019t a compulsory study semester, so you can take 0 classes and still be considered a full time student.\n\nIt would be worth looking to see what courses are offered during that trimester before planning how many courses to do in the first two. If you wanted to maintain a full time student status you\u2019d need to do atleast three courses in both trimesters 1 and 2. So you could do a standard years worth of credit points as 3, 3, 2. But if you wanted to get ahead, you could always load more classes on top of this. \n\nHope this helps.",

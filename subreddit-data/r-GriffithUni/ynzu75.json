If there's any alumni or students with experience in the subreddit, would you mind helping you out?\nI'm not the most tedious student out there. But I am trying. What's the easiest major of the three?\n- Information Systems\n- Network and Security\n- Software Development\n\n( Note : I'm not a big fan of coding, so I already ruled out Software Development)\n\nThank you! \ud83e\udd79",

Is there a lot of partying going on besides the studies? Is there a lot of other activities happening besides the studies, both inside and outside the campus? I\u2019m really looking for a great and fun experience rather that studying 16h a day. I\u2019m from Europe so don\u2019t really know how it is studying in the Australia.",

So it's like 20 dollars average for one hour and u can work a maximum of 48 hours per week.\n\nEveryone says jobs are guaranteed so that's fine.\n\nBut the downside is, if I get 50% scholorship, only then is it SOMEWHAT  affordable because, I did the math and tuition alone would suck 5 months of income, excluding any sort of expense. \n\nSo if ur going independently with no family support, try to calculate roughly with the unis tuition and u should only go with minimum 50% scholorship or to a cheaper uni",

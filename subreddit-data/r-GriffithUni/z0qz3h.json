Student Mentor here. \n\n\nYou can choose your major in the first year. \nI changed mine from a BMarine Science majoring in Ecology in Tri 1 to the BSc double major Marine Biology and Chemistry in Tri 2.\n\n\nIf you have any questions relating to your degree, the first year coordinator would be the best person to contact. DM me if you have any other questions.",

If you don't choose one for IT you're automatically enrolled in Info Tech. \n\nYou can find more information in the Degree Details section of the\n[Degrees website](https://www.griffith.edu.au/study/degrees/bachelor-of-science-bachelor-of-information-technology-1045).",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm an international student who wants to apply for the Doctorate in Philosophy I saw that Griffith University offers PHD without the need to complete Masters which will save a lot of money. This is on the basis that I am able to get a good GPA and am able to publish a research that is approved by the university. How strict is the admission process for example if the minimum GPA requirement is 3.5 and my GPA falls just below that at 3.3 - 3.4?",

I got accepted last December 2020 and currently waiting for the Australian borders to open to commence my candidature. In regards to the admission process, I must say that it is less stressful than what I went through when I submitted my applications to the universities in the US.\n\nWith regard to your GPA, I am not sure if they will put so much weight on it. However, I believe that they will heavily base their decision on your research experiences or potential since you will be applying for a higher degree by research (HDR). I have a master's degree which I earned a year before I applied for a PhD and research publications. I am not sure if these pieces of information make a difference.\n\nAll the best in your application!",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI got accepted for Bachelor of International Tourism &amp; Hotel Management / Bachelor of Business for Oct/Nov 2022, Gold Coast Campus, but I am having second thoughts on the location I chose. \n\nI heard that studying in the Gold Coast campus isn't the wisest choice when compared to the Nathan campus as the Gold Coast is more of a tourist destination. Nathan Campus being closer to Brisbane also provides higher chances of getting a job. On the otherhand, the Gold Coast is a tourist destination so it correlates with my degree. \n\nHowever, Nathan Campus is older and smaller, being located in the suburbs, while GC Campus is newer and larger. I haven't heard anything good about the GC campus other than the newer facilities and size. \n\nI don't mind studying in the suburbs or anything like that, but I am conflicted on which campus has a better quality of education and how easily I can attain a job. \n\nI do know my degree of choice is very risky, but I am drawn to it. So I am not sure which campus I should apply for since I want to maximise my career chances.\n\nIf anyone who has studied this double degree and/or has knowledge on this topic could comment below, it would be much appreciated.\n\nThank you.",

Been told you really want to go to GC because of the numerous amounts of hotels, restaurants etc due to the tourism in GC. Easier to get jobs in the hospitality industry whilst studying. \nHaven\u2019t experienced it but it\u2019s what I have found.",

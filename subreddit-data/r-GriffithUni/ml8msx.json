I\u2019m wanting to do a diploma through Griffith college to enable me to enrol in a bachelor at Griffith Uni. Has anyone here gone through Griffith College ?",

Griffith have great support for starting students. I just got started there as a mature age student, doing a bachelor of science and I got in with an old cert 3 plus an English bridging course. Go for it! Follow that dream.. all the best with it.",

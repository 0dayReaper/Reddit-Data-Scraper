    "postText": "Hello everyone,   \nI didn't want to send an email yet to the uni because I wasn't sure exactly what to ask. I just mainly wanted to know what would happen with students that are supposed to start in Semester 2. I've already met the conditions for my unconditional offer but I'm not sure how my deposit payment would work now that there's been travel bans set. Would I have to pay and then start Semester 2 online? I'm really lost and would appreciate some answers if someone knew anything about it!   \nAlso, the university hasn't emailed me about it yet so yeah.",

If not then this may help, I'm an incoming international student from Canada and emailed them last week and they got in touch with me the other day. Basically all of semester 2 is going to be online, they're sending out new offer letters to reflect this change, the tuition is the same amount and once travel bans are lifted students can start entering Australia. They're hoping that trimester 3 will be in person, if not then the international students will be in Australia but doing their courses online. You need to meet the conditions for your offer (including paying your deposit) before you start semester 2 so that you can apply for a student visa and go to Australia when restrictions are lifted. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't received the new offer letter yet so not sure if what they told me is set in stone or will change.",

U.Q.) and become a doctor. \n\nI\u2019ve told him the reality. \n\nDoctors are the biggest welfare ADDICT JUNKIES in Australia. Practically for most of them for the first 10+ years of their career, and for almost all of them for all of their career, they are suck and suck on the BIG \u201cG\u201d TITTIES of the gummerment getting that Medicare BIG G TITTIES MILK welfare every fvcking day to see patients many who just go to the doctors just cause they want to get out of school, work and other obligations.\n\nYou can tell in a flash.\n\nWhy does this happen?\n\nAustralia is about the only fvcking place in the first world where you wait all night in the ER while doctors and nurses hang around outside smoking, talking about how wasted they got last weekend.\n\nWelfare people are welfare people and it\u2019s been pointed out that 90-99% of Brisbane\u2019s economy is welfare people. Doctors are welfare people, no different from other welfare jobs welfare program people.\n\nBrisbane: I see welfare people. \n\n",

You don't even understand the shit that doctors have to go through. Then, years after they do something, or don't do something, some immigrant pajeet or chink (probably Griffith Law) is looking at every fucking thing they did wrong. And for what? A pitiful 100k a year? So they can go to a party and say \"I'M A DOCTOR!\" OR because Hollywood \"IS THERE A DOCTOR ON THIS PLANE\"? and they can think they are some fucking hero because they treated a stranger for no money and will probably get sued for it or hunted down by their family?\n\nYou are fucking naive! Let me guess - Griffith Arts?",

Doctor does something and you have years to look at it and millions of google pages about the right way for doctors to do something, and medical stuff. Elites don't want their kids becoming doctors, but Bogans do.",

The real one-two punch will be when, after house prices go down, people\u2019s super nest eggs disappear as the bank-heavy ASX collapses. Banks will be bailed out by you and me and every other person here. But the traffic is shit, the hospitals are crowded and the schools are crowded. The Brisbane school my brothers sends his kids to has an incredible statistic that 48% count English as their first language. Read from this that the majority are either new arrivals or first generation settlers. And the school is overflowing \u2026 and surprise, surprise, the school is asking parents to contribute to make up a funding shortfall. I suggested to him that our taxes, often paid over a period of 20 years, should have this covered, right? Answer \u2026 No. Then I suggested that those contributing to the funding crunch, and haven\u2019t paid taxes over a generation should be asked first. Answer \u2026 No (and very inappropriate) Then I gave an example of when we lived overseas, all foreigners had to pay for their schooling (very high, too), whereas the locals received it for free. Response \u2026 that is not Australia.\n\nGuess fucking what? Your all dumb,\n",

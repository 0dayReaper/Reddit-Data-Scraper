Is there anyone here that is doing an Arts degree, or knows someone doing an Arts degree? \n\nIs the Arts program any good? I know you have to do 6 compulsory classes that don't have anything to do with your major. Is it worth it doing these classes? \n\nAlso, to anyone studying it or knowing someone studying it: is creative writing any good at Griffith?",

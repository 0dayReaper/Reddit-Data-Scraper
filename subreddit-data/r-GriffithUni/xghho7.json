I don't mind noise, I love parties and I like the idea of the social aspect but I also like sleep... is it really as bad as some people say?\nThanks guys!",

The people I met at the village are still my close friends 2 years later. But as far as price and quality of accommodation goes there are definitely better options out there. As far as noise goes in my experience it was just as bad as any other apartment complex out there, fridays and Saturdays get a little loud but nothing too crazy.",

Also, is there a major difference in the quality of the premium vs standard apartments, or is it just the AC? \n\nYeah I'm moving on my own from NZ so I reckon it might be worth making some friends in the first year.",

I got pretty lucky with mine but have friends who had less enjoyable experiences with messy apartments and loud roommates. The bond issues can be bad but if u make sure to document the condition of everything when u move in they shouldn\u2019t be able to charge u for any issues that u didn\u2019t cause. As for the premium apartments I\u2019m not sure the difference but I imagine there isn\u2019t much difference than the AC as all the rooms I saw were pretty much identical",

Focusing on studies is nearly impossible with the constant parties on the village, and the RA doesn\u2019t do anything about it since they are all under 20 and residents themselves! It was absolutely horrendous, and the flat we were given had a broken microwave, a leaking fridge, and a moldy fan. We are all international students (Hong Kong) and the staff treated us as if we would be ready to accept anything. Ridiculous.",

    "postText": "I am currently enrolled to start a bachelor of criminology/criminal justice at Griffith and having seconds thoughts\u2026 I would ideally like to work in courts/parole/probation but would like to keep my options open for case work with victims/supporting victims. I am not interested in any sort of counselling more so in the courts or as a family case manager/intake and assessment worker. Am I able to get into this with a bachelor of crim/justice degree or do I really need to change to crim/psychological science to keep these options open? The criminal justice major definitely appeals to me more than the basic psychology units but I also don\u2019t want to be restricted. \n\nAny advice or info would be appreciated!",

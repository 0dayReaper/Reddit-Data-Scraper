I have put in a query with Durham and it would probably take them 5 to 6 days to respond.\n\nI had applied for Liberal Arts (Undergraduate) in Durham, King's and Manchester. I have been offered a conditional offer letter since my exam results are not out yet by King's and Manchester. I have 8 days left to reply to my offers. So, should I wait for Durham to process my application or should I make a decision with the offers I have at hand? I am really anxious as if it takes them around 5 days to reply to my enquiry, I don't know if they can actually process my application within 8 days or not and how complicated the process actually would be...",

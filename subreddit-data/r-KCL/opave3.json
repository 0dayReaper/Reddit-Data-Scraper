            "comment": "I think anyone could apply as long as they have 2 A stars and one A , plus it also depends on the course you want to study, some courses just don\u2019t have the space to accepts new students, so they allow students with offer change their course( something like adjustments)\nYou could always apply through clearing, I know kings will have some clearing courses this year \nBut again it all depends on the course you wan to study",

If they don\u2019t have space because I have an offer I could change my course few weeks into the year into computer science because the courses are really similar\nBut I would say make sure you call them on results day, in addition consider doing electronic engineering (they mostly have space ),\nBecause electron engineering doesn\u2019t suit the masters degree I want to do I\u2019m changing it,\nOtherwise it\u2019s also a good course",

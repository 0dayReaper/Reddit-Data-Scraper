            "comment": "I lived in GDSA (Great Dover Street Apartments) my first two years. My main attraction was the price (just over 200/week), which was one of the cheapest I could find and the centrality of it. It is really close to guy's campus (about 5min walk), which you would probably appreciate.\n\nQuality-wise, I'm not gonna lie, it's one of the worse ones. Rooms are really small, and the furniture, kitchen and bathroom appliances are all quite old and over-used. You might get lucky and get one of the rooms/flats where they've been replaced, but I wouldn't bank on that.\n\nFrom visiting my other friends, I know that there are quite a few considerably nicer accommodations (e.g. Moonraker and Julien Markham), but the are quite a bit more expensive. Plus, I have found that GDSA is a lot nicer than Wolfson House, which is the only cheaper one I believe.\n\nOverall, I did quite like it though. After a couple of weeks you get kind of used to it and even though it's a bit of a sh\\*thole, I started really liking it. GDSA is also quite big and you live in flats of about 5-8, so I found it easy to make new friends both years.\n\nHope this helps!",

GDSA is obviously much closer to guys, which is quite an advantage if you have to go to an early lecture after a night out haha. Julien Markham is also in Elephant and Castle, which is a lot more dodgy than the Borough area in my experience. As a woman, I felt somewhat safe on the well light streets at night, but I always avoid going to Elephant and Castle by myself when it\u2019s dark.\n\nJulien Markham in itself however is much nicer than GDSA and if it were just about the rooms/kitchens, I would definitely go for that. Of course if you go for a cheaper accommodation you can spend more money on food, clothes, nights out, etc, which you might want to take into consideration as well. \n\nI think it just depends on what you think is most important. That\u2019s kind of the main difference between the two accommodations I can tell, so it\u2019s just a matter of which aspects are more important to you.\n\nI personally never even visited an intercollegiate hall, so I\u2019m unsure about how they compare. I did quite like being surrounded by so many King\u2019s students though, as it was easy to find people from your accommodation that go to the same campus/societies/college events. Intercollegiate might have other advantages though, I really have no experience with them haha.",

After all, I chose to live there a second year, so it was definitely nice enough for that.\n\nThe main issues are really that everything is quite old and not up to modern standards. With other accommodations you can tell that the furniture and appliances are quite new, whereas most of the stuff at GDSA seems to be about 15-20 years old. Most of it still works, and they do make an effort to replace it if it's broken, it just takes a while sometimes. \n\nThe ensuit bathrooms are more of a wet-room than a proper bathroom as the shower head is just kind of in there, so when you shower you get everything wet. And then in general, the rooms just are very plain and old. They don't look modern or sleek, just a bit basic and what you would expect from a cheap accommodation. You can definitely make it look nice though, with a few personal belongings I felt super comfortable in there.\n\nThe main adjustment I think with GDSA is that if you are lucky you are living at your parent's house, where everything will most likely be at a certain standard and GDSA probably won't fully match that, which can just feel a bit different. \n\nI definitely got used to that and really enjoyed my time there. I really didn't care that much in the end that it wasn't the nicest accommodation. Apart from COVID I used to spend most of my time on campus or out with friends anyways, so it really didn't matter all that much to me where I lived as long as it was decent enough. Plus the location was a big bonus for me because it was incredibly convenient for me.",

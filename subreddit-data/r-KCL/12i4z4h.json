Their website specifies they give out offers within 21 days after applying (considering that they may take longer during peak processing periods). Has anyone who applied in February received an offer yet? And should I be worried?",

I submitted mine on the 15th of November last year, and got my acceptance on the 15th of December.  I got my response relatively fast, but I know some friends (who ended up getting accepted as well) that got their response up to 3 months later",

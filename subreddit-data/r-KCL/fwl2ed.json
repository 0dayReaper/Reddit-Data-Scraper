    "postText": "Hey guys! \nSo I need to book my accommodation soon and from what I gathered from YT videos and recommendations I heard that \u201cGreat Dover Street Apartments\u201d seems like the best option for the costs. But from further research i found out that Stamford Street Apartments is closer to the Waterloo and Strand Campus but apparently it\u2019s really old and the facilities are not as great. Also to add the cost of transportation because GDS is like 20 mins away. Hoping any current students can give me some kind of advice and clarity!!! \n\nThank you guys \u2665\ufe0f",

            "comment": "I stayed at Stamford Street, had my classes at the campus near GDS, and had friends at GDS and at SSA who studied at Strand. I'm going to try to give you all the information I can.\n\n\nFor location SSA is infinitely better, you might get a slightly noisy room because of a main road, but it's unlikely and it's noisy everywhere cause it's London. At SSA you are walking distance from Southbank, thats the area next to the river, there are lots of great spaces, restaurants big and small, you are next to the station which has all your Macdonald's burger king needs and lso other restaurants like wasabi, relatively cheap. \n\nFrom SSA you're basically connected to everything. Strand is just across the river walking, some days it will be windy and rainy but it's not long and again that's the city, it would be worse from Strand, unless you spend on transport which is not cheap.\n\nSome parts of SSA were being refurbished,three years ago it was just one floor on one block, now I know the reception is also nicer and has a communal area. \n\nFrom what I remember three years ago, GDS and SSA were practically identical in terms of rooms. GDS has more students so has a rec room with computers which is useful but SSA is literally opposite a KCL library which you can access. I had friends who entered lectures at Waterloo campus five minutes after waking up.\n\nI am biased because I went there and had a great time but objectively I would also recommend SSA.\n\nPlease ask if you have more specific qs, I'd be happy to help if I can.",

I was on the website and I couldn\u2019t really find proper pictures of SSA refurbished rooms and was wondering if you knew someone or had proper pictures of the new refurbished rooms because from what I\u2019ve been in online the older ones look like bigger rooms because the beds are smaller. And the pictures of the refurbished rooms look hella tiny but idk if that\u2019s just the pictures.",

I don't have pictures but I saw one of the new rooms when I was there and it was very very nice but the same size as my room, and with the bigger bed there was barely space to stand if not in front of the desk/ toilet door. That said, normal rooms come in slightly different sizes.",

I did the IB in Spain and after receiving the grades required for kings on the 7th of July I got an update in UCAS saying my place was confirmed in Kings. However, I have not received any email whatsoever by KCL. Is this normal? Do I just have to wait? perhaps I have to wait until the UK gets their A-levels. IDK if anyone got any insight let me no please thx.",

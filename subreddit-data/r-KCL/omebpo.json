I also know of another person that didn\u2019t meet their offer requirement for Physics yet still got in. Also, you got 42 points, that\u2019s amazing!!! In that aspect you have exceeded the 36 points.  \n\nI would say contact KCL via the application portal and explain the situation. Whilst contacting them also state why you still believe you are qualified for this course (e.g you got 42 points). \n\nMost importantly, don\u2019t lost hope. I know a few more people who have just missed the mark in their HLs yet still got admitted. If you really want to go to KCL, hang in there, you definitely have a chance still. If not, you could go to your insurance, go through clearing, or re-apply next UCAS cycle. \n\nAs much as people may deny it, it\u2019s definitely not uncommon for KCL to accept people who haven\u2019t met the requirements :)",

I contacted Kings and explained the situation and was told to wait till the beginning of August when the A-level result come out. I did and they accepted me at the end. So it is possible, good luck :)",

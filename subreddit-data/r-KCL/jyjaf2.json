    "postText": "Hey gusy so im currently in my undergrad in a uni in the states, but I am really hoping to do a masters anywehre in the finance field in either Kings or Cass. I just wanted to know the overall rep fo the business school for masters because I wanna apply to which ever one is easier between the two to get admitted to.  I am basically targeting Cass's masters programs in the finance area (not sure which one yet) but the admissions person I talked to said that they generally accept students with GPA 3.3/4. I was just wondeirng if it would be easier to get into Kings with the same GPA . Is the Kings business school in general less selective than Cass's one for masters programs in the finance area?",

            "comment": "yooo i got into political economy as well, but for your question itself, I feel like studying at a world renowned university such as King\u2019s at such a low price compared to American universities is something very valuable. \n\nI don\u2019t know how easy it would be to get internships at King\u2019s or Boston University but I think it would greatly depend on your personal work ethic and not the university itself. No matter what university you go to, the process of becoming a lawyer will be similar. You do an undergraduate degree in whichever university and then go to a law school in America for 3 years and then pass the bar exam.",

I mean you can always change to law in the States but then remember that you\u2019ll have a hard time getting an internship not related to your course in London",

    "postText": "Hi, I'll be an exchange student from Australia starting at KCL in September.\n\nAt my uni in Aus we have faculty clubs for each degree (e.g. science students society, arts students society) and, at the beginning of the school year, they each hold a 3 day camp which is intense, but fun. Everyone is strangers on this camp except the 2nd year leaders and it's a really easy way to make friends because everyone is in the same boat, and we have the club to be involved in afterwards to solidify the friendships. The club becomes a really nice small community thanks to the camp.\n\nI was just wondering if KCL has an equivalent?",

This is generally followed up by all societies having individual induction/icebreaking events (can be anything from sport games, to drinks,\nto historic tours, depending on the society)",

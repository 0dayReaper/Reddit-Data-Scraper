            "comment": "Enrolling in the same course in September! Am not American (French), but I have a few mates who have studied at KCL (IR, Business) and who've enjoyed it. Which accommodation will u be staying in? \n\nFrom what I've been told and what I know, the bulk of our classes will be at Strand Campus, so really centrally located (opposite the London School of Economics) - I got to visit the campus a few weeks ago, and the War Studies department is spread across 2-3 floors iirc, coursework-wise it's definitely more similar to the American system than the French system (take-home exams, assigned readings etc) and it seems like our courses for the first year are pretty set in stone (Historiography, Art of War Studies, Contemporary Security Issues, Causes/Exp of War and two historical modules). The second year offers more flexibility especially in the joint-honours program, and the third year revolves around a dissertation (equivalent of an undergraduate thesis in the US).\n\nOur department has a podcast (think it's called the \"War Studies podcast\") which could help set the scene, but the degree is so versatile (especially for 2nd and 3rd years) and ultimately our module choice will determine where we are going with the degree. I reckon keeping up with current geopolitical trends (sites like [https://www.cfr.org/](https://www.cfr.org/) are a good shout, [https://warontherocks.com/](https://warontherocks.com/) is quite popular with up-and-coming academics in this field), read up some grand strategy (KCL is world-renowned in this field, and there are lots of events held at the Centre for Grand Strategy, including some co-hosted by our department - check out Yale's curriculum in grand strategy here : [https://iss.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/GS%20Syllabus%203-25-13%20version.pdf](https://iss.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/GS%20Syllabus%203-25-13%20version.pdf)), and some historiography (how we write history, how we approach history etc) should do the trick for first-year students. \n\nFrom what I've heard, IR/War Studies is a versatile field, and what you do with the degree is more important than just getting the degree itself (I'm referring to internships, I think RAships are very tough if not borderline impossible for undergrads in contrast to the US), and KCL has a plethora of student societies (including some linked to our course - the War Studies Society, the Intelligence &amp; Intl Security Society) which seem pretty interesting and who seem to offer good guidance for future career trajectories (not to mention an opportunity to meet people with similar interests etc). \n\nLondon is an awesome city to study in, although it is expensive (5-6\u00a3 per pint iirc, groceries and life expenses are expensive) - lots of cultural and social opportunities for students. There are a few good deals for students (such as a 30\u00a3-per month membership at Pret, which allows cardholders to get up to 5 drinks/coffees per day at no supplementary charge), and the uni itself has great facilities iirc.",

    "postText": "I applied for a double MA programme at Renmin University in China and KCL in London. This morning I just received an email to attend a meeting for information on getting to Renmin. However, when I checked my application portal, there was no change in status confirming I was even accepted.\n\nI received the offer holder meeting this morning (about 20 mins ago). Does this mean I have been accepted, or is there a mistake from KCL?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1st Update - I contacted the admissions department and received a generic reply that offers will take time to process.

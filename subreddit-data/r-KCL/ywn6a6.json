You get out of it what you put in.\n\nIf your course is structured like mine, I would advise you to \n- do the work on Keats the day it is given. \n- interact as much as you can. \n- See if there is a WhatsApp group or similar to join. \n- Also, start assignments as soon as you can.",

            "comment": "Congratulations! I've done this with my masters in law at King's and have found the balance tricky but manageable. It really depends on your employer, to be honest. In my first year, I was working as a full-time administrator at BMW (40 Hrs/Week); BMW allowed me to work 4 days a week and finish early on one of those days to allow me to make it to my lectures. The job that I had then was a standard in-office role and no hybrid solution was available to me and this made things difficult as it meant that I missed from a lot of the opportunities offered at Kings. In addition to this to make up for the hours, I would work a few 12 hour shifts and a shorter one on a Thursday, I finished the year with fairly good results - on the borderline of a distinction overall but worn out. \n\nNow I'm in my final year of the LLM in another full-time position working for an arm's-length branch of the ministry of justice. This role is hybrid and although it is 5 days a week, it is only 35 hours. This made the balance much easier because not only do I work full-time, I also commute to university from southern Kent. This means that twice a week I will work from university campus and 3 days a week from home - my lectures are both 2 hours long so I class one hour of each lecture as part of my lunch hour and make up the remaining time across the week and this balance works! I have found that my current employer understands the academic demands of doing a master's more than my last one at BMW, and I feel that that's had a real positive impact. \n\nTypically (like any lawyer) the answer I can give you is \"it depends\". Are you commuting to university from particularly far away? Does your employer understand the requirements to be successful in completing a masters? Are you particularly good at being organised and unafraid to work a few late nights to get essays and projects in on time for both work and uni? \n\nIt's a daunting step but one worth learning to adapt to deal with - Kings is an excellent university and an opportunity not to be missed. \ud83d\ude42",

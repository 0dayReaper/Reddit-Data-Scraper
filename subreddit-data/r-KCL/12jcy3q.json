But then they didn't contact me for about three weeks and I found that extremely weird.\n\nHowever, in that week I had called them as well and they had assured me that the admissions officers are just busy. \n\nI'd suggest giving them a call to clear your doubt. Maybe they could tell you on call what documents they require of you or even extend your deadline for said requirement.",

Plus I was able to call them at 9:00 pm IST which is 3:30 GMT so the timing worked out for me!\n\nIf you are worried about excessive phone charges I suggest quickly finding someone who has a cheaper international calling plan (My parents plans were good) and calling them. \n\nI understand your urgency in the matter and if King's is somewhere you'd like to go/ are considering, a call is the best and easiest solution!\n\nHope this helped!",

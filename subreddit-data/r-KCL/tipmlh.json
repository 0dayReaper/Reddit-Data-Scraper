    "postText": "Hi, I am an international student from Morocco and I hold an offer to study Law (LLB) at KCL. I cannot afford the tuition fees at KCL and taking a loan isn't an option for me as of right now. I was wondering if any other international students know of any scholarships or financial aid offered to us. The only one I can find on their website is the Sanctuary Scholarship which I am not eligible for. I tried contacting an advisor at KCL but their answer was very confusing so I contacted the admissions office and I am waiting for an answer.\n\nThank you so much in advance",

Although very few compared to post grad. But check each one out in detail and maybe you fit some. Also check on ur application portal where u see the offer and all messages of kings. That might show a fees and funding tab ...check there. \nI have also applied to KCL for psychology but haven't heard back yet. \nSo this reply is based on the knowledge of how most other unis in the UK operate.",

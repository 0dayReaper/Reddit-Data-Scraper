    "postText": "Hi I am an American (from LA) international student applying specifically to King\u2019s College London, and I am interested in applying for an undergraduate in Nursing and I have an Associate\u2019s degree. I know credentials work differently here, but my main area I am most concerned about is financial aid and packages (if any) they offer. Would you say there\u2019s some potential in getting some help with tuition? Also what are the steps would I be taking as I am to apply? I do know I want to apply and need to apply through UCAS, which I have begun, but this is my first time applying internationally and the websites + links have all really really confused me and it\u2019s a lot to process. I understand accommodation with the schooling is a lot more expensive as well and while it is not my first option, around what rate would be a good fit?",

    "postText": "Hello! I am an undergrad student at the University of Toronto planning to do an exchange next academic year at KCL. As I am trying to plan out my courses needed for my degree, I am wondering how many modules in maximum can you take at KCL per semester/year? I know we need 60 KC per semester or 120 KC per year, but is it possible to take 75 KC per semester or 150 KC per year?\n\nIf anyone has experience please let me know. Thank you very much!",

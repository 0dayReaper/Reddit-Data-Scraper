    "postText": "I applied for MSc in Advanced Computing in late November 2021, and it has been around 19 weeks but I am yet to hear back on the application decision. I tried asking them about the status of my application twice, but no luck. Both times they told me to check the portal status and didn't share any tentative timelines. Any suggestions if there is something I should be doing in this case?\n\nI assume one reason might be that as I am an international student, they are taking longer than usual to process the application. Are there any international students here who are also waiting for their application decisions?",

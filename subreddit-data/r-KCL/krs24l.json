Maybe I've missed something but all I am seeing is 'Save next' and it takes me onto 'funding'. Its allowing me to proceed to payment with one referee, but I have another and everywhere on the KCL site says you need two. Can anyone help me with this or know anyone I can contact to help me out as the KCL FAQ mentions nothing about this.\n\nThanks!!!",

As far as I know, only some course applications require two references. So, you'll just have to pick one out of your two and you can submit it. Good luck!",

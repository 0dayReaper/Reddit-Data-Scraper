It seems like my ideal uni in terms of location, buildings, social life, etc, but I'm very weary of applying due to the low student satisfaction. Is there any reason I shouldn't apply here?",

I know quite a few people who had a bad time socially in geography. \n\nSoas was easier to make friends, but I would say at King\u2019s I learn\u2019t more about geography.\nSo it\u2019s a trade off, like anything.\n\nEach dept is going to be very different imo so I recommend you find someone from medicine.\n\nAlso I might be a bit biased because I\u2019m from the countryside and autistic. So living in London was hell on earth for me. Others may have a better time.",

            "comment": "Hey!! MSc student just about to graduate from KCL here, soo much of the low student satisfaction seems to come from social issues or the unreliability of administration in certain departments, which I think has been totally overhauled because of COVID but varies widely across depts. For example, it took much longer to receive responses from the Law dept than from the Social Sciences dept in my experience but even \u2018delayed\u2019 responses only take a week or so. If you have concerns socially, I wouldn\u2019t worry as KCL halls are huge but aside from that there is often a sense of community in medical degrees that is not in others, you guys will have the same core lectures, you will join medical societies and might even go on placement together in some instances so regardless of the university you choose you will have a robust social circle in a medical degree. I loved King\u2019s, the libraries feel magical and the academic staff are so accomplished and kind. I have NEVER learned as much as I did in the last year it was such a wonderful experience, even remotely. Standards are high and you\u2019ll need to work hard but King\u2019s is no different to any uni in that regard so if you\u2019re considering applying I would. I was so concerned about student satisfaction and almost chose Manchester over KCL because of it, but I took the leap and wouldn\u2019t change my decision for the world! Good luck in your studies :)",

What MSc are you planning on doing? \n\nWith regards academic tips, I would just say question everything haha independent and critical thinking are the most important skills you\u2019ll learn in any postgrad degree and those are the skills you need to show to get a good grade. Other than that, you\u2019ll get much more helpful information from your professors than me! My biggest tip is put yourself forward for class rep, such a silly thing and honestly you\u2019ll feel really awkward in the beginning but lots of Masters students don\u2019t want to subscribe to the social side of study - they\u2019re clocking in and out just doing what they need to do to get a good grade and go home. This is totally valid and understandable especially for people doing an MSc during their career but lots of students still want to have a social aspect to their studies. By becoming class rep you\u2019re a point of contact for your entire class, it\u2019s your job to get to know your course mates and their job to know you so awkward introductions and pointless conversation are at a minimum! Also, you get to know your professors without having to go to unnecessary office hours etc so it\u2019s a win win. There\u2019s a slight workload associated with the job but it\u2019s minimal in comparison to the benefit it provides you by the end of the year! If you have any specific questions feel free to message me on here and good luck with your postgrad :)",

            "comment": "Ya I was researching the same thing when I was in year 13 and now I'm wishing I took the advice of other students into account. I don't want to go into to much detail but there is just a general lack of support from the departments not matter which department they're all equally unresponsive and unsupportive which now might not seem like a big deal but when you are struggling it's not great waiting months for a response/outcome, no1 really cares for your personal circumstances, you have to be there for yourself don't expect any help. Personal tutors are not great (nothing against them personally but you can tell they're not interested in being a personal tutor) mine just doesn't care I've had friends tell me how their tutor told them they were stupid because they were struggling with a module. I won't lie I loved kings and it was a dream of mine to go there. I ignored anything any1 ever told me about them. My first year there was wonderful I made great friends, I enjoyed my course, great society events, location, summer experience and it was perfect for me. The lack of support only started to bother me this year because I was really struggling on top of that the pandemic hasn't made things easy there was no understanding or help from any1 at the university. Even now writing this Idk if I am a student at the university or not because no1 knows what is happening or they do and no1 is Informing me. It's a great university in terms of calibre of education and ranking but you need to evaluate for yourself and you can't predict whether you'll have problems in the future or not but if you have a support system at home or anywhere else to help you through a rough time I would consider it. Best if luck with your decision",

I really wish there was more engagement from the faculty honestly, it would have made my time there much more fulfilling.",

Also everyone keeps to themselves and your friends could be in London but they could be living in north, south, east or west so it\u2019s a bit annoying. i lived in GDS and had friends living in Wembley studying the same course as me. I was blinded by the Russell Group and \u201cprestigious status\u201d that i didn\u2019t realise my faculty was  \ud83d\udca9. I felt alone studying and had no personal tutor support especially with a healthcare course. i wish i applied somewhere else in year 13 but now i\u2019ve taken an unconventional gap year in the middle of 2nd year, transferred course and uni and i\u2019m so much happier now. not to mention it\u2019s sooooo expensive\ud83d\ude2d",

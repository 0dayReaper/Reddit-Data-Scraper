Both are great schools, but there can be vast differences in what is taught depending on the faculty, so figuring out which aligns better with your interests is probably the most important thing.\n\nThe econ/politics departments at KCL and LSE also differ quite a bit on ideological grounds (at least from my own exposure), so talking to the departments could also help you figure out which is better for you on that.",

So generally you'll probably encounter more things like critical theory, Marxism, etc. at LSE than at a place like KCL. KCL's political economy faculty, for example, have quite a few more libertarian-minded professors and are generally more pro-market than their LSE contemporaries. For some people that is a draw, for others it's a negative, depends what you're looking for.\n\nImportant to note that it doesn't mean that either school is gonna be super biased in one direction or anything and there is a lot of variability within each school. So much depends on specific departments and professors, which is why it's important to dig into particulars of your program.",

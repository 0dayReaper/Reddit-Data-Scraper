I\u2019ve never lived on my own so I thought it might be good to have a proper campus, but then again I love the city but it\u2019s also a lot more expensive, so I\u2019m genuinely torn. Also I\u2019m worried about the nightlife and job prospects too, and Warwick\u2019s has so many Indian students ahahs in from India so i was hoping to meet more international kids\nAlso If there\u2019s a freshers chat for kcl on WhatsApp or discord or insta PLEASE TELL ME",

            "comment": "Hi! I had to make this exact decision last year! Choice between Warwick and kings and I went with kings.\n\nI didn\u2019t do finance unfortunately, but I imagine being in London would be much better in terms of finding networking opportunities and future work compared to Warwick. \n\nThe Warwick campus is lovely, it feels like being in a big town of just students. Kings lacks the campus atmosphere, but the London atmosphere can\u2019t be beat if you enjoy being in a city. Warwick is comparably quite quiet and you\u2019ll likely be on campus a lot of the time. \n\nAlso there\u2019s loads of Indian people at kings (especially international students) because London is so multicultural. There\u2019s also lots of opportunities to mix with students from the other london universities. Warwick does have a lot of Indian and Asian students, but the surrounding Coventry has less so. \n\nFinal thing to consider is cost. London is expensive, so housing, food, bills etc. will all be much higher in London than Warwick. As an international, you\u2019ll already be paying a lot for fees so these other costs you may want to consider. It would be a good idea to work part time during the degree if you find you need the extra cash.\n\nHope that answered a few questions!",

It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ll be living on my own so I thought a campus might be good but I adore the city and thought that would be good for internship opportunities, but then again the cost is a big factor to consider and I thought that I could simply live in London over summers. Also, are there any freshers groups? Because I found quite a few fir Warwick but NONE for kings",

I do know a fair few of the medicine internationals who say they\u2019re enjoying their time here. \n\nI commute in rather than live at accommodation. Warwick accommodation is bigger and cheaper, so if you do decide kings, you\u2019re going to have to accept a pretty small room. Check out some kcl room tours on YouTube for an idea of size. Kings do have something called the Kings Affordable Accommodation Service (KAAS) that can reduce your accommodation costs, so that\u2019s worth looking into. \n\nI\u2019d recommended getting a part time job if you do decide kings to help with the expenses. I know an international poly sci student who is able to work remotely from campus. London also has lots available for work, as does the kings campus itself. \n\nBest bet for freshers chats is to see if they have a Facebook or Instagram page for your year. Once you\u2019ve joined, they should give you an invite for WhatsApp chats etc.",

            "comment": "My advice for you is to look at the course firstly. Check out the modules and the course content and decide which one interests you more. In terms of prestige and job prospects, there is hardly much difference as both unis are very highly regarded in the UK. I firmed King's and insured Warwick for Biomed because I think King's offers more interesting modules and its life sciences department is very flexible since I get the opportunity to switch to more specific subjects such as pharmacology, whereas Warwick doesn't offer this opportunity. Of course, I'm not thrilled about the lack of campus life in London, but I'd rather be somewhere where I'd enjoy my course and KCL has a highly renowned life sciences department.",

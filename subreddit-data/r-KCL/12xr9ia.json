            "comment": "So, there is a handful of scenarios possible here:\n\n1. You want to extend your acceptance deadline? Don\u2019t count on it unless you are applying for funding/have received funding. If either of the two applies, send a message with proof that you have applied (an email screenshot is usually sufficient) alongside the date by when you hear back OR proof of award of funding (the funding letter must say that it will fund all of your studies, not just a partial bursary). For all other cases, you won\u2019t get it extended. If your message(s) don\u2019t get viewed until after the deadline, it\u2019s okay, your offer will get reinstated (if either of the two situations apply) and extended/accepted on your behalf (depending on the situation).\n\n2. You want to know some department-specific information before accepting the offer - send an email directly to the department with the question. You can try to send a message via King\u2019s Apply with a screenshot of the query to show that you are querying something with the department, and your acceptance COULD get extended (can\u2019t vouch for this one)\n\n3. If it\u2019s something about full-time/part-time mode of study, send an additional message asking to extend your deadline (before it expires!) asking for an extension since you are waiting for a response on your previous query.\n\nWith all this in mind, it is likely that it will take a handful of weeks before you hear back on messages to Admissions - all Admissions across the UK are in one of their seasonal peaks and people work round the clock to deal with everything, so things are taking a but longer than usual. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t forget that you get a 14-day cooling off period after you accept your offer to call it off and be eligible for a refund! (Same rules apply, if you want to reject your offer after accepting it (within 14 days!) then just send a message asking for that, even if you don\u2019t hear back by then it\u2019s okay, your message will be reviewed and dealt with. If you don\u2019t hear back after a month I would send a follow-up message to query things further.\n\nHope this helps!",

    "postText": "I'm a student at a university in Canada studying CS. Thinking between KCL and USyd for exchange next year. I really wanna do KCL just because it would give me access to the rest of Europe.\n\nQuestion about student residences I have is: do student residences at KCL have a meal plan for the students living there. At my university, if you stay in a residence, you can get a meal plan and eat in the residence cafeteria. Once you run out of money on your student card, you can just add more and use it at the cafeteria.\n\nIs KCL the same way?",

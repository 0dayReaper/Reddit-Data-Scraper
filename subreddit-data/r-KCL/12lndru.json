    "postText": "Hello, \n\nI recently got my offer for both these programs - MSc International Relations and MSc Terrorism, Society and Security. I am thrilled and excited but at the same time, I am very confused. \n\nI am from India and will be an -international- student, so the risks are high. If there's anyone who has pursued or is pursuing either of these degrees, then please help me make a decision.",

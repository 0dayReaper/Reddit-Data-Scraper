I want to really try my hardest and go to a really good school like Oxford for masters after undergrad. \n\nDoes the lack of a computer science department affect the programme structure at all? I really want to compare the different first year / 2nd / 3rd modules but since I don't know what I should be looking for, it's pretty hard.\n",

I recently looked at the first-year course outlines of some leading CS departments in the UK, and there was a general trend of the following modules:\n\n- Programming\n- Discrete mathematics\n- Continuous mathematics (incl. linear algebra)\n- Electronics\n\nAt KCL, there is a lack of the later two, while a strong emphasis on the first two.",

Whilst its name isn't the computer science department, it is still the same.\n\nThe department of informatics is part of the school of natural and mathematical sciences, which also encompasses physics/maths/chemistry.",

The first year programming courses especially are constantly challenging students (in a good way!) and giving them opportunities to actually apply their learnt knowledge.\n \nHowever (and this is purely my own opinion) I have found that many 3rd students lack necessary research skills for solving non-programming tasks (e.g. experimental design, physical systems).",

    "postText": "Quick question:\n\nI am an American student who will be applying to King's next year, and it says on their website that they want to see you submit 3 AP scores with at least a grade of 5, along with the ACT or SAT. However, they do not specify which AP scores are necessary. I am currently taking AP Computer Science Principles and I was wondering if that would help fulfill my admissions requirements if I want to study politics or foreign language, considering that they do not specify which AP scores to submit. Also, does King's have a phone number I can connect with for American applicants?",

KCL's curriculum (last time I was in) does not require Calculus by the way.\n\nThey also accept 3 700s in SAT Subject Tests in conjunction with SAT/ACT which I would imagine would be easier to attain than 3 AP 5s.",

            "comment": "i'm actually a junior right now and i'm looking to apply to KCL this fall. from the info that i've gathered, i think its highly recommended that your AP scores cater towards the subject that you want to study. i'm planning to apply for dentistry so i'm submitting AP scores for AP statistics, AP chemistry, AP biology, AP physics 1, and AP calc BC when i apply (and predicted grades for AP physics mechanics, AP psychology). honestly though, they will also accept APs that aren't related to your desired subject as long as the score meets their requirement (i'm also submitting my AP seminar, AP lang, AP micro/macro econ, and AP lit scores despite their irrelevance to dentistry). also, i know that the subject tests are scrapped now but either way, i think the majority of americans were submitting AP scores instead of subject tests anyways. universities also equate APs to A-levels more than they do subject tests to A-levels. i'm pretty sure the subject tests are more similar to the GCSEs if i'm not mistaken. \n\nalso, kings does not have a phone number but you can reach out to them by email. they usually take around 1-2 weeks to reply but they do, eventually! \n\n\\--&gt; try using this link to submit a question to them:\n\n[https://self-service.kcl.ac.uk/haveaquestion/](https://self-service.kcl.ac.uk/haveaquestion/)\n\nalso, KCL has a system called \"unibuddy\" where you can reach out to current KCL students. they're actually really helpful and they can help put you in contact with specific admin to help address your questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni hope this helps!",

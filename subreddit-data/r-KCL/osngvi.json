    "postText": "I'll be heading to Kings from the US this fall to start my History BA. I'm fully covid vaccinated (Pfizer), but according to the UK gov travel restrictions, I still have to self-isolate for 10 days.\n\nDoes this mean I should quarantine by myself after move-in day? I'd like to avoid this because this would mean that I would miss week 0 events and classes would start during my quarantine period, not to mention all of the things that I have to do once I get to London like opening a bank account, phone contracts, etc.\n\nJust simply asking for advice: should I fly to London early (\\~2 weeks before move-in day) and self-isolate at a separate hotel room that I book? I know this option would be expensive, so I would appreciate it if there were a cheaper option.",

For the place to stay, I'll rent an apartment (see my other post) with friends or other students, haven't booked yet but I plan on doing that next week. If it shouldn't be available right from the start, I'll just take an airbnb :)\n\nAnd I agree the \"Test to Release\" option from the other comment sounds like something that could work well for you, I'd be sure to check that one out",

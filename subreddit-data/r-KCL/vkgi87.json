    "postText": "Hi! I applied for a masters in banking and finance in the first week of April and there has been no decision till now. I already have an offer from the University of Edinburgh so I don't know if I should keep waiting for KCL or move on. I'm an international student so it's important to get started on my visa application. I'd appreciate your advice.",

However beware they may just tell you to be patient because they have so many applicants",

I'm not sure entirely about your particular programme. The filling up aspect is of course an issue, but that was going to be the case regardless, considering how many deffered applicants there were from last year due to Covid.",

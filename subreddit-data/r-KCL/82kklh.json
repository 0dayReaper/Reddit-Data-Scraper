I have friends who lived in Stratford and despised it. The building was nice but they felt so far away from campus and central London, and they ended up spending a lot of money on transportation. ",

Stamford Street is a cheaper alternative and it's still very good. Have a look on Campusboard, they're really good for student accommodation, I used it and would recommend it. ",

I went once but I was like black out drunk 10/10 experience \n\nwould genuinely recommend champion hill but it's been 3 years since I lived there, but camberwell is a much more fun and affordable area than both central or stratford \n\nIf you're going central (like moonraker) why not stanford st? save a bit of \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3",

I guess I'll just get whatever they give me :)) ",

Still a cool choice if you decide you would do the 51 wk, unlike a lot of the central locations there's a lot of outdoor space, it's quiet and chill.\n\nI would not rank Ewen highly due to it's location and the fact I don't know any undergrads who lived there (I assume you're first year and want to mix as much as poss!) I guess if you can get it cheaper Moonraker is a safe choice, GDS also! I know friends who lived there in first year. I still think Stamford could be a fair choice despite possible disruption, it's hard to tell how extensive it will be :( \n\nThere's also the intercollegiate choices which you could look into? I don't know anything at all about them but know quite a few people who lived in UOL residences.  ",

You need to do 120 in a year, in a way that is feasible with the timetable, i.e. you can't take two modules that run at the same time. Generally the split is 60 in Semester 1, 60 in Semester 2. But it's not concrete",

I.e. you need to take 120 credits of level 4 modules in your first year, 120 of level 5 in your 2nd year, 120 level 6 in your 3rd year, etc.\n\nI don't remember if it's even possible to take level 5 modules in year 1, or level 6 modules in year 2. I don't think so, but I graduated 2 years ago so I may have forgotten. \n\nI also think that with the timetabling it would be almost impossible to have an empty semester. And you wouldn't want to do that anyway. In my final year I split the modules 30 in sem A and 90 in sem B, and it was hell. Splitting them evenly is the easiest way about it, IMO",

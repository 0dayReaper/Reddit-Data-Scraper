As far as I know no books have changed but they always update the list with the newer editions of the books on the list. So if reading try and find newer edition. \n\nStart with \u2018biochemistry and molecular biology\u2019 and the \u2018essential cell biology\u2019 text books first. \n\nDONT buy them because they are not required and honestly way too expensive. You can go to local library or b-ok.cc to download for free",

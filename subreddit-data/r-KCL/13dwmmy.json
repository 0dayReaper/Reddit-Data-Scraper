So I\u2019m a postgrad trying to book an en-suite (I cannot share a bathroom for the life of me) in vauxhall but I can\u2019t seem to figure out which side/floor has the best city view. I suffer from depression and I\u2019m afraid the times I spend at my room would feel lonely if it\u2019s facing a wall or the back of a building! Help me out please if you have lived there before",

So, I lived there in 2018/2019 (the first year it opened) and tbh all rooms usually had a good view (though things may have changed slightly since Vauxhall is a giant building site, pretty much). HAVING SAID THAT, I can tell you that the whole building does get a lot of light - and the terrace on top is usually not busy at all, and you will often not meet a single soul. Obvs staying on a higher floor helps, I was on the 20th floor and it was amazing!",

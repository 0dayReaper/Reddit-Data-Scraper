Dover castle is a pub near to one of the student accommodations and is very busy on a Friday. There is also student nights at ministry of sound on the tuesday. I\u2019d say overall when you find your people and the types of night out you like there so much choice, especially as you\u2019re in London a massive city you aren\u2019t just limited to student nights.",

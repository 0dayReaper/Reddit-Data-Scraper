    "postText": "Hi, I hope some student nurses can help me...I would just like to know the workload at Kings? Do you have assignments whilst on placement? Do you get good feedback on assignments to feel you can improve? Are lecturers/tutors approachable? Did you have any issues in general? I'm hoping to firm Kings, but I've heard of people having some problems, so I just want reassurance :) Thanks",

My personal tutor is amazing but some of the students dont have friendly ones. Be prepared for placement which can be really emotionally draining",

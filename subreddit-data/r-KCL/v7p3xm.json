My advice is first pick a room from a somewhat good residence (depending on your priorities, like I chose Angel Lane) which will enable you to at least have a nice place to stay. And then start looking for a better room than that to switch it, eventually something shows up but you have to be super quick. (I changed mine to Great Dover the next day but it was very hard to find it)",

I think you can still find a room if you check it continuously, but if you can\u2019t your best chance is the results day. It might be a bit chaotic though, since many people who couldn\u2019t find one will be doing the same.",

You will need to provide us with their details if you would like us to contact them on your behalf; this should be the same information you provided for your existing referees when submitting your application:\n\nI originally submit 2 referenced as requested, one of them being a professor who teaches at my university. I reviewed my application and it looks like this reference has been deleted or doesn't appear anymore. Is the university asking for a 3rd reference because one of my referee's submissions wasn't sufficient, or do they want me to resubmit the details of this second referee?",

I would reupload the deleted one, but also email them and ask if they received 2 and wanted a third, or if they only received one.",

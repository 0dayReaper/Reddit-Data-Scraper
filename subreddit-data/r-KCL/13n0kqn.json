            "comment": "I have no idea about Hayloft since it wasn\u2019t open when I was there, but seems like there are some threads on [the student room](https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=7195542&amp;page=4) from last year.\n\nI predominantly went to Guy\u2019s and Waterloo as well, and was at Champion Hill for Fresher\u2019s: the rooms themselves are very nice (en suite) and you share fairly decent sized kitchens/common area. There\u2019s a gym (but no racks), ping pong table, pool table etc. That said, people generally like to party and stuff, but at the same time, we were quite frequently told off being to loud by the security guys from personal experience. Also it was quite a pain traveling to and from Champion Hill (20 mins by train/overground, 50 mins by bus).\n\nI can speak a bit about Moonraker\u2019s and GDS. They\u2019re both fairly old, and it\u2019s not an \u2018open\u2019 corridor like Champion Hill (i.e., your suite and suitemates are enclosed from other suites). Both have amazing locations from Guy\u2019s. Moonraker\u2019s has slightly nicer rooms than GDS, but not as nice as Champion Hill; GDS is honestly quite awful, and it\u2019s pretty well-known for having the toilet inside the shower (which I can confirm, it\u2019s only really separated by a shower curtain\u2026)\n\nAlso note that you don\u2019t necessarily have to go to any of these accommodations if you don\u2019t want to, but it is a really easy way to socialise and to get to know other people.",

I'm debating if the nicer rooms and facilities are worth the walk to Guy's and Waterloo or if it would be better I stay closer. Do you know anything about the area which Hayloft is in? Is it safe?\n\nI don't see anything about Champion Hill... maybe its not available anymore? \n\nWould you say moonraker is worth the price with it being the most expensive accom? I only got to have a look with pictures and google maps but the area looks quite empty?",

                            "comment": "[This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/h8usbk/aldgate_east_whitechapel_safe/fusx7pb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=1&amp;context=3) sounds about right; there are objectively rougher areas in London than Whitechapel area, but I\u2019ve heard stories and such so it\u2019s hard to say. For instance, I lived in Elephant&amp;Castle for a year and was completely fine, meanwhile a friend was mugged (this also happened near Champion Hill).\n\nI think I heard Champion Hill had to be shut down on my last year for construction safety concerns or something, but I thought it reopen\u2014might be wrong tho lol.\n\nI haven\u2019t been in London for some time so I don\u2019t really know what the rent prices are like these days, but it ultimately depends on what you\u2019re comfortable compromising: I would personally say yes Moonraker\u2019s worth it, especially considering how close it is with Guy\u2019s campus and if you want to experience a more lively 1st year (if money\u2019s not too much of a concern*). If you want to focus on your studies, maybe not\u2026\n\nEtA*",

            "comment": "I\u2019ve been living in Angel Lane for the past year and absolutely loved it. Stratford has amazing connections to pretty much every part of London, including most airports, making it an amazingly convenient location, which cancels out the fact that it\u2019s slightly less central. All of the amenities like supermarkets, gym, mall, park, etc. are right at your doorstep and the area overall is quite busy, which imo makes it safe, as there\u2019s always people around. Never felt threatened or unsafe.\n\nMy only qualm is that the rooms in the accommodation are tiny. You get a lot of storage, but no floor space, so it gets quite claustrophobic. Given that Hayloft rooms are exactly the same but much more expensive, it makes Hayloft a much worse deal in my opinion",

Do you have any experience with this?",

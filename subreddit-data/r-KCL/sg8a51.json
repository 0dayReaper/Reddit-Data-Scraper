The location is brilliant, the bedrooms were comfortable, and the kitchens were decently well-fitted. \n\nGuest policy is likely COVID-dependent but I don\u2019t recall there being one when I was there pre-pandemic. \n\nHope this helps.",

Not to mention an easy tube to other parts of central london. The rooms are good as far as student accommodation goes but location is definitely the high point",

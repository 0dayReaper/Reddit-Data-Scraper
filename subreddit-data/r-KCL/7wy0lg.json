I've talked to my counselor and she knows absolutely nothing about applying to uni in the UK.\n\nThe school I'm attending is on a quarterly basis. Can some explain to me how it works at King's? I realize I've missed the fall deadline of January 15th. Is there no way to apply for the following semester/quarter?\n\nThanks.\n\n",

If you wanted to transfer you\u2019d basically have to wait until next September. \n\nTransfers from one uk university to another are pretty uncommon, transfers from US to UK are almost unheard of. I know it\u2019s technically possible but wouldn\u2019t know how it\u2019s done. \n\nThis website should have some answers:\nhttp://www.fulbright.org.uk",

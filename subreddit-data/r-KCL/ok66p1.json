    "postText": "So, I have received a conditional offer letter from King's for Liberal Arts (UG), and I had a few queries:\n\nResearching about the course, I found out that there are very opposing views regarding it. Some say that it is a useless degree, while according to others, it is very beneficial. I looked at what is taught, what is vital to myself, but I am still confused about the prospects.\n\nIt seems like a very enjoyable course, but I wanted to know what kind of career opportunities can it open up for me, especially if I move back to India after completing my education.\n\nSo, the experiences of Indian students who have done an undergraduate course in a reputed university related to Humanities and Social Sciences and have moved back to India would help. I need information about whether the course is worth it, like it is costly, so the earnings I get later will be justified or not and does it open up a lot of good career opportunities in India or not. I know these are very personal questions, so please provide me with some insight...\n\nThanks in advance!",

My opinion, which I believe would be shared by many others, is that Liberal Arts is for those who want to appreciate culture, or whatever human civilizations have achieved (literature, history, philosophy, and such), for those (using a rather controversial word) who want to be enlightened. \n\nI mean, if the money is the most important factor, I suggest you major in computer science, engineering, law, etc., because with a degree in one of them, it will be easier for you to find a job.\n\nAs far as I know, with a degree in Liberal Arts, your expected salary would be lower than people with a degree in mathematics, computer science, law or something's expected salary in any country.",

Obviously you can't apply to Msc in Mathematics or Theoretical Physics program with a BA in English.\n\nEven if you obtain MA in English or History, I think they won't be helpful unless you want to go to academia.\n\nI emphasize it again, if money is what you want, Humanities are not good choices.",

I am not interested in going towards maths or Science in anyway and even law doesn't interest me.\n\nI understand your point, so if the whole field is not where the money is, I am fine with it because frankly this is what I want to study and this is what I can study but according to you in the courses related to Humanities is Liberal Arts a good option? Or should I go for a specific subject like History or Politics\n\nI chose Liberal Arts because I really like how I can study a variety of subjects, so I find the course to be very interesting.",

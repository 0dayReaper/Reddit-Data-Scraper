    "postText": "I went to Brighton Uni for my undergrad, which is far from a 'top school' like King's, but *everything* IT related (the PC hardware, online course information, library search) was many times better than at King's. \n\nSome points that annoy the crap out of me:\n\n* I used the PCs at the Maughn Library recently to check my mail. By the time I'd waited for the PC to boot up, start IE (Firefox not available), tell it to 'save my settings' in the knowledge it would do no such thing, search for Gmail (in Bing!), wait for IE to crash and recover, 30 minutes had gone by! This is, IMHO, really, really crap. \n\n* Fuck OneSpace. If I want to read BBC News, I'll go to BBC News. Also, many, many things are not in this one space. \n* Anything with 'e' in the title. 'e-learning'? **OF COURSE IT'S 'E', IT'S ON THE INTERNET!**\n\nAnyone else want to add to the list?",

Using the ones at the Franklin-Wilkins building was a nightmare, and in the Maughan, I eventually gave up and started bringing my own laptop.\n\nThe email system can be quite tedious at times, as VolcanicArmado stated. Some people prefer to forward their mail to Evolution, using the [evolution-mapi package](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/evolution-mapi). It is however being upgraded at the moment, new students will be able to use \"Outlook Live\", rather then the Web Access, although I don't know how different that will be.\nI'm hoping that the rest of the IT system will be having an overhaul as well this year.\n\nThe ones in the computing labs on the Strand are much better, dual-booted with XP and Gentoo, however you have to be on a CS course to get in the labs.",

I think I've logged into the OWA twice since (in 2 years) to empty it - and Gmail lets you send from the kcl.ac address.\n\nWith regards to the other stuff though, when I started 2 years ago they told me the computers would be upgraded within a few months, and it never happened. If I'd known I would have invested in a good laptop back then instead of at the end of course!",

I usually just bring a USB with Chrome installed on it and run from there, fuck everything about IE so much. The email client isn't great either, if you middle mouse click to open a new tab it doesn't open that email, only another link to your inbox.",

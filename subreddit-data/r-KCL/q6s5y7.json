I've researched it quite a lot and have been to open days, and still clueless. Wondering if you guys would recommend king's or if you regret choosing them? If so, ciukd you explain why? Just struggling with the decision rn. I know this is such a broad question, but I also wanna know what social life/atmosphere is like, and stuff like diversity.",

I\u2019m looking into accommodation for this upcoming September and was wondering as a US international student what would be a good accommodation hall to try to score a room in? I\u2019ve been looking into all of them, but they fairly do seem small and was wondering if it is worth getting an apartment instead nearby one of the campuses?",

Studios are generally quite expensive (I think last I was there [pre-COVID] was ~\u00a3270+/wk ish) and small in private apartments/campus accommodations. I looked at some nr Elephant &amp; Castle which are okay in distance to Waterloo/Guy\u2019s campus.\n\nIf you want to look at cheaper places, it\u2019s probably a better option to share a flat.",

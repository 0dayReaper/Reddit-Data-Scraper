I\u2019m actually doing a third a level this October, the results of which will be out in January 2022 (which is past the UCAS deadline) \n\nAnyone been in my situation and applied with only two and sent the third one in after they received their results? (I\u2019m a private candidate by the way, so I can\u2019t give them predicted grades)",

I applied for an MA at Kings College over a month ago, and my application status still says \u201cReceived and being processed.\u201d I\u2019m trying to be patient, but I\u2019m feeling very nervous and can\u2019t stop thinking about it. Is it normal for it to take this long to process? Or is anyone in the same boat with the length of processing? Thank you!",

I already accepted an offer at another university that I am going to stick with, so I won\u2019t be attending after all. However, I took someone else\u2019s advice and emailed them (not through KingsApply). \nA few days after they got back with me with a generic response, my status went from processing to having an offer. So maybe , if they still haven\u2019t gotten back with you, you can try reaching out and letting them know you have an offer somewhere else or that you wanted to see if there are any issues with your application. (I just said that I have other offers and, since my application has been processing for over 2 months, I wanted to see if there are any issues I can get ahead of).",

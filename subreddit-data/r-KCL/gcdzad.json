    "postText": "Hello. I want to firm King\u2019s, and there\u2019s a 2000 pound deposit that needs to be paid. Do you pay this once you fulfill the conditions of the offer or once you\u2019ve accepted the offer? \n\nMy offer letter barely provides information on this. They say \u2018once you\u2019ve fulfilled all the conditions on your offer and hold an unconditional firm place in the programme, you will need to pay the deposit\u2019\n\nWhat do they mean by unconditional firm place?",

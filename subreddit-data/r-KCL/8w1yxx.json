    "postText": "Hi. I\u2019m holding an unconditional offer for MEng Engineering at Kings. I\u2019m stuck between going for a year in industry or attain a CEng status through the Masters route. Of course, both would be ideal but I don\u2019t have that option at this point of time. Can anyone provide an insight to how I should approach this?\n\nI\u2019d like to get into any of Automotive/Avionics/Software sectors if that helps. \n\nThanks for reading.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, I recently sat my UCAT exam and did not do as well as I had hoped. I got 2790 and Band One, with 700 VR, 690 DM, 780 QR and 620 AR (lol). I was wondering if I have a shot at applying to King's this year and getting an interview. According to this year's prelim results i'm in the top 20 percent but I want to be sure before wasting one of my four uni choices. For GCSEs I got three 9's, two 8's, three 7's and a 6. Again, not the best. I am also a international student technically despite living here for the past 4 years and doing GCSE's here. Someone please let me know what to do, if it's worth applying to King's and if I would be able to get an interview. Thanks",

I would preferably like a bigger room so whichever one with big rooms. The price isn't the worry rn to me. I just want a big room and a good ambiance in order to feel less like away from home.\n\nThanks in advance \ud83d\ude4f",

Not necessarily distance in miles, but transport links etc.\n\nOther than that, I\u2019d avoid Moonraker bc it\u2019s too expensive for what you get imho",

Firstly consider which campus you\u2019ll mostly be in and unless you want a long commute, choose one that\u2019s closer. I\u2019m doing BA War Studies and I\u2019ll be in Strand Campus, so the closest one for me will be Moonraker, which is also one of the most expensive. I mean, if you reallllyyy don\u2019t give a sh*t about money, a studio in Moonraker or Atlas would be really cool. The location is really nice in my opinion",

How's Uni life in London or at kings in particular and is it hard to get into the social scene\n2. Is KCL really hard or how does Uni in the U.K work differently then outside\n3.  any tips you wish you had known going into Kings would be super helpful for anything social life or academics\n4. If any of you have taken any courses in Political Economy or are in the program any info would be appreciated",

Uni life in London is very different to campus experiences - for one a lot of students commute in every day. 1) I\u2019ve found that most of my friends are from my course, or external societies. 2) The political economy course is pretty much evenly split between essays and exams - get use to reading for about 4 hours everyday. 3) Go to the \u2018philosophy bar\u2019 - it\u2019s got an elusive reputation because no first years can ever find it; it\u2019s heaps better than the SU. 4) My friend does political economy and loves it. One of the benefits of being taught at a leading research university is the quality of the lecturers. Additionally, because we\u2019re based in London, we get experts from many different fields coming in to give external lectures on a weekly basis. ",

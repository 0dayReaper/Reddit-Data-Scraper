I may as well just defer if thats the case, would KCL give a definite yes or no if I ask them if the whole year will be online/hybrid, or will they just jump around the question?",

Deferrals will be highly exceptional and in rare cases. Check your offer letter.",

                            "comment": "Hi, the university highly discouraged this because there are certain programmes that are fully online (which are already fully tailored to be done remotely with course materials purposely made available to succeed in the course). Especially with the efforts they have made in terms of safety and free COVID tests that basically is an entry requirement for certain uni buildings (library etc), and free vaccine shots, it would be a difficult argument to make to them. Honestly, it will depend on your programme because some have clinical/lab/internship/seminar meetup aspects to certain modules. They even say to come two weeks earlier than the official course start date for orientation (where we get important information for resources on campus and get our IDs which will be needed for most buildings(keycard access). It'd be really difficult to not have physical access to the library as not all books relevant to a course/field have been digitised, or are affordable to purchase all in all. If you're international, you could try asking depending on immigration hurdles, but again, they might rather just give your spot to someone else. It'll depend on the cases and overall trend/safety issues as the months unfold.",

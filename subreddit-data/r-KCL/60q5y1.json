    "postText": "I never thought of applying to the UK, I've always focused my efforts on securing a position in one of North American universities. \nUntil yesterday when a family member suggested\" why not try the UK\". So I started googling and the program structures are quite different. For instance, they have very detailed subject areas\nhttp://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/subject-areas/index.aspx\nand it doesn't mention if prospective students need to secure a research supervisor or not. Do we? how is KCL different than the major research universities in North America? ",

            "comment": "i think the deadline for the accommodation *guarantee* has passed, so u can still apply when new accommodation is uploaded to the site but it just means it's not 100% that you will find one. otherwise the people who for example have kings as their insurance choice and can only prepare to go to kings after they receive their results wouldn't be able to get any accommodation but i'm sure the system works to enable people to get accommodation as long as there are available rooms. just means the more that you wait the less are available and from what i've seen the really expensive options get filled up last",

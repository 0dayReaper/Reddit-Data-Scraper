Ask for a schedule and just head to the class. You can ask to enroll onto the course on KEATS and access the content. On the other hand, actually getting credit for the module you attend and doing the exam is another thing completely. \n\nSource: I did physics and would very often go to international relations and philosophy lectures",

If you want to take a literature module then you'll likely need to discuss with student services or respective academics about whether it's possible/reasonable. \nHopefully you are able to attend a literature module, however, since I can see on your profile that you really do love literature.",

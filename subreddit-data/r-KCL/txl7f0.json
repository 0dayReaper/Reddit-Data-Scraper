    "postText": "Hello everyone! I am currently studying in America but plan on studying abroad next year at King's for my third year. I'm in the process of booking my accommodation and I was wondering if there were particular KCL residences that older students/other study abroad students tend to stay in? Or do most have their own accommodation by that point? Any advice would be greatly appreciated :)",

I registered right away when I got the offer from KCL so I'm surprised that there are no available rooms to book.  Looks like they only allotted a few rooms to exchange students.  KCL admin told me to just keep checking the portal for cancellations.  I couldn't even request to be put on waitlist as the portal is a live system.  Any advice on how to get into the uni accommodation or any student accommodation near KCL at this point?",

When I click \"Book Your Room\", I get this message \"Important Information: Study Abroad Autumn Term (Sept 22-Jan 23) There are currently no rooms available to book for Study Abroad Autumn term students.  Please keep checking the portal for cancellations.\"  I initially thought there was something wrong with my login account so I sent an email to KCL.  They said it's fully booked and they could not do anything about it.  I just have to constantly check the portal for cancellations.  I'm a bit frustrated with the lack of support from KCL.  Any advice?",

You have to be on the ball with booking accommodation right when it opens, everyone I\u2019ve spoken to here has struggled with finding options if they\u2019re not quick. When I booked I had a few options, and I\u2019m currently at Moonraker Point this year. It\u2019s in the expensive side, but it\u2019s very central to London and I got lucky with finding really close friends in my flat. I\u2019ve also heard oof things about Angel Lane and Hayloft, though Angel Lane is very far out so you\u2019d be paying to tube in. Although the accommodation is fairly nice compared to others and the en-suite is a bonus, finishing up the year I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d rebook Moonraker for the price\u2026as unfortunately we had a lot of things break and a big mouse problem that\u2019s been going on for months :( Back in October I didn\u2019t have a working bathroom light for a month even after submitting multiple requests! As for the mouse problem, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because we\u2019re on a lower floor. So if you do book it try to go for something higher lol",

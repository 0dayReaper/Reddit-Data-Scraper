    "postText": "I have been looking on the KCL website and thinking about how poor it looks, especially for a University that is supposed to have many Professors in computer science and marketing. Its a space where our future employers will look. I think the courses need far better descriptions, each course should have its own unique videos and pictures. Personally, I think an employer wouldnt be impressed with my program based on the website, which is an issue. What do you think? \n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/129yi2p)",

In some situations KCL is regarded similarly and sometimes even better than Cambridge, like dentistry which I believe KCL was ranked Number 1 in the world in 2020. \nThe website design will never impact your or anyone's applications no matter which university they go to unless it was very very low ranking",

That includes many of the leading doctors and politicians. Some of the younger people are aware of newer rankings but most people arent aware about much when it comes to UK Universities",

    "postText": "Has anyone taken a temporary leave of absence (interruption) from the university? I have a few questions about it.\n\n1. Do they refund the tuition for the rest of the academic year? Or do they pass it onto the next academic year?\n2. How long does it take for them to confirm the request after submitting the change of circumstances form?\n3. For the accommodation, King's Residences told me that they will give refunds. Do they actually refund it in cash or do they also pass it onto the next academic year?\n\nThank you for your help :)",

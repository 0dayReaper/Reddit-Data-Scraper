Ideally aiming for SSA but it hasn\u2019t been on the portal (and when it is it goes so fast) so I\u2019m thinking on settling for Garden Hall - but I\u2019m worried about missing out on social life because Garden in particular is so huge a residence. Has anyone lived in one before and would recommend selecting it over a King\u2019s-only hall?",

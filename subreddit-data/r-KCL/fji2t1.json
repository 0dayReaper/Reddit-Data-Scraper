    "postText": "It's exactly as the title says. I've recently gotten an offer from KCL and I'm looking for accommodations, but I'm not sure where to live. I'm not from London and, as such, have no context about what the area of any of the listed accommodations are like. What little I know comes entirely from the website. Price is not really a factor for me. My campus is waterloo campus. My questions are as follows: \n\n1. What is an intercollegiate hall? \n2. What would you say is the best accommodation for a first year student?\n\nThank you!",

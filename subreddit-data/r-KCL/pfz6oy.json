    "postText": "I drove to a VFS premium center for my biometric appointment, and paid for the 3-5 day processing back in early-mid August. It has now been 17 days with no word, and I am supposed to fly out to the UK in 12 days\u2026\n\nHas anyone else been running into this problem?! I have been contacting both UKVI and VFS with no response from either. How long did it take you to receive your visa after your biometric appointment? Thanks!",

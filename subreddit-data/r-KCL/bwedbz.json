All responses are kept completely anonymous, and we are compliant with GDPR. You needn't even comment on this post- you can anonymously email the address provided ([DoP.CBD18-19@UCL.ac.uk](mailto:DoP.CBD18-19@UCL.ac.uk)) for more information. Full participation in this study will be rewarded with up to \u00a3106 (minimum of \u00a3100).\n\nParticipation will be as follows:\n\nWe will initially send you an online survey to determine eligibility. This will ask you some questions about your health, past trauma, and drug use. This will be followed up by a phone call to further determine eligibility and will involve us asking you some questions about your psychiatric history. Testing sessions will involve an assortment of computer-based tasks and pen-and-paper tasks. There will be two testing sessions, each lasting roughly 7 hours, which need to be separated by at least 7 days. Lunch is provided and we can cover reasonable (i.e. from within London) travel expenses.\n\nPlease do email [DoP.CBD18-19@UCL.ac.uk](mailto:DoP.CBD18-19@UCL.ac.uk) for more information or if you would like to participate!",

            "comment": "For more information, this an email from the principle to all staff and students, regarding this change.\n\n&gt; Dear staff and students\n\n&gt; I wanted to send out a brief note outlining some of the proposed changes in the way we will present the public image of King\u2019s in the New Year and explain the rationale for them. What is proposed, as you will see from a public exhibition in February, is a very modest change similar to how several other large London university institutions are now presenting themselves. As an expression of our ambition for King\u2019s, we will change our  promotional name to \u2018King\u2019s London\u2019, continue to use \u2018King\u2019s\u2019 informally, but keep our legal name \u2018King\u2019s College London\u2019 for legal documents,  academic citations and the awarding of degrees.\n\n&gt; Introducing the new brand is one part of a process of incremental change at King\u2019s to improve our performance in both education and research as we aspire to be universally recognised as one of the world\u2019s great universities. I have described this process elsewhere under the label of \u2018King\u2019s Futures\u2019, a programme of initiatives to strengthen our profile in areas such as business, technology and the natural sciences, to enhance the student experience and to introduce greater internationalisation to our curriculum and student body. We will phase in the introduction of the new brand gradually over three years \u2013 starting with our website and the undergraduate prospectus \u2013 to ensure effective use of existing resources.\n\n&gt; As you know King\u2019s has evolved dramatically over recent decades to become one of the largest universities in the UK with vibrant activities in almost every area of academic endeavour. Our tradition is a long and honourable one and our name \u2018King\u2019s College London', often abbreviated to \u2018KCL\u2019, is well known to the academic community and to most students in the UK. However, our research conducted over the last 18 months with potential students, parents, staff, students and alumni, revealed that our current name was causing considerable confusion: is King\u2019s a residential college, is it an academic college akin to the colleges of Oxbridge, or is it an educational institution of some other type such as a further education college? Internationally, there was further misunderstanding as \u2018College\u2019 is not a widely understood term in many countries. Going forward, we will refer to ourselves as a university rather than a college wherever possible.\n\n&gt; I fully recognise and understand that many staff and students, past and present, have an emotional connection to \u2018College\u2019, however I believe that in today\u2019s highly competitive global marketplace, King\u2019s needs to be bold about its ambitions and shout about its many achievements. The purpose of a very modest repositioning is to deal with these concerns sensitively and constructively.\n\n&gt; We have prepared some FAQs where we provide more detail about the introduction of the new brand. If you have further questions, please get in touch with brand@kcl.ac.uk and the Brand Communications team will be happy to answer them.\n\n&gt; Best wishes\n\n&gt;   Ed Byrne\n\n&gt; President &amp; Principal\n\nMy personal opinion below on (LocalLin), as I want to keep this mode account) impartial.\n",

                    "comment": "My personal opinion, seperate from the mod account.\n\nI believe that a rebranding of King's is not necessary. King's is a university, not a company, it does not need to attract customers through marketing strategies, it needs to attract students through strong (current) academic research, and providing a first class education. This rebranding is sidestepping the main issue that King's is facing (as are many other London universities) that of falling student satisfaction. King's feels that it is losing out on potential students to other univerisites (especially international students).  I feel that this may not be the most appropriate change to make at King's at this time.\n\n I fear that King's is moving further and further towards the idea of selling an education, and restructuring into a more businesslike model. This is illustrated in the FAQs linked in the email (see bottom of post):\n&gt; 1. What do we mean by 'brand'?\n\n&gt; A brand is a \u2018promise of an experience\u2019 and conveys to **consumers** a certain [...]\n\nThat aside, I have a second issue with the name \"King's London\"? I have never heard anyone call it that, and I'm here for five years now. \"KCL\" yes, \"King's College\" yes, even \"King's\", but \"King's London\"?. I am wondering how this name was chosen. The consultancy, from the FAQ again states:\n\n&gt; 6. How have people been consulted about the review?\n\n&gt; We conducted qualitative market research with external audiences to help identify the attitudes, expectations and emotional responses to specific brand proposals. Internally, we consulted all students and staff through a web survey. We also conducted focus groups with staff, current students, prospective students and parents, KCLSU, alumni and international agents and advisers. This research and feedback has shaped our thinking.\n\nWhile the research and feedback has *shaped [their] thinking*, it doesn't state what sort of feedback was received, was it positive or negative from the students? I am also having difficultly finding in my email any websurvey polling about the name change.\n\n\nRegardless, I think that if people are interested in discussing/petitioning the name change, they should get in  contact with the student union [KCLSU](http://www.kclsu.org/), or their departments.\n\nWhile it is simple to click a change.org petition, I do not believe in this case it will change anything. King's has already invested time and money into this name change, and a change.org petition will not sway anybody who makes the decision. The main issue I have with it, is that this petition is apparently open to anyone on the internet? As such, these votes may not be a fair representation of the student/staff body, and can be easily dismissed.\n\n An internal petition/discussion/organisation would be much better at showing that it is actual staff and students who are interested in this. Email Sebastiaan Debrouwere, the president of the KCLSU (**president@kclsu.org**), or tweet him (**@kclsu_seb**), or any of the [KCL student officers](http://www.kclsu.org/studentofficers/), and see what the student union is doing about this, if anything.\n\nOk, back to my research.\n\n**tl;dr Contact the student union Email: president@kclsu.org Tweet: @kclsu_seb, don't rely on the change.org petition, it alone will not do anything**\n\n**edit1** : There is a post by the KCLSU student officer team [outlining their basic plans](http://www.kclsu.org/blogs/blog/Student%20Officers%20Blog/2014/12/16/Officer-Statement-on-the-Kings-Rebrand/) Do still contact them however, and make sure if you agree or don't agree, that you are heard, don't just be complacent and let everyone else make the decisions for you.\n\n**edit2** : The FAQ page for this at an [internal link only](https://internal.kcl.ac.uk/erd/depts/brand/brand-review/faqs.aspx).

                            "comment": "It's been almost 10 years since they changed the name of the medical school from GKT to Kings college London medical school, no one refers to it by its \"new\" name. The 2005 rename ignored 100s of years of history, the 3 independent medical schools had a rich heritage. This was forgotten by the student, they even use the old logo for all merchandise! So as part of the rebrand they are reverting back to GKT for the medical school. Surely the lesson of this is that without student concensus (and other important stakeholders like lectures and alumni) any rebrand is futile.\n\n",

I just found out my friend's tech company gives negative points for attending KCL in their CV screening, whereas Cambridge and Oxford receive +2 points etc, and other universities in London + Russell Groups receive +1 points... why is KCL receiving negative points?",

The only better regarded universities at the time, e.g. having more privileges or better opportunities open to them in the industry, would be Imperial, Oxford and Cambridge",

Also, it's not all about what Uni you go to. I plan to get a job at a small software company at first where I'll get some experience and then after 1-2 years aim for one of the FANG style companies. \n\nHave a look at places like Monzo, you'll find not everyone there even has a degree.",

However, I have heard that American students usually have an easier time getting an offer from these schools because they pay more tuition, and therefore, is less selective. These schools mainly require a 5 on AP test, but would they admit me if I submit 3s or 4s? Has anyone reading this gotten into these schools as an American? How hard is it?",

But if your scores/grades don't match up with the general American entry requirements, I think it would be pretty hard and you'd need to write a good statement or take more tests to prove that you are able to keep up.",

I know credentials work differently here, but my main area I am most concerned about is financial aid and packages (if any) they offer. Would you say there\u2019s some potential in getting a not so bad tuition ?",

If you have questions about credentials I can help too, but I think UCAS and the unis provide a lot of information already.  \n\n\nTuition is pretty much fixed for international students, it's \\~35K a year. Financial aid isn't as generous as it'd be at Oxbridge or the way the Ivies do it here. I'm self-funding and it's honestly a little rough, but I think there are scholarships available to nursing students that will cover a big chunk of the cost.",

I probably will end up being self funding as well and while I know it can be a bit rough (but doable) I wonder if it\u2019s worth going to the school for and instead continue my education here in America? I do wish to be able to relocate + travel + have the opportunity to learn somewhere else if I could but financial just scares me a bit as my family doesn\u2019t make the greatest income. I have not seen any nursing scholarships available for nursing students just yet (probably because the next semester application hasn\u2019t opened up yet) but I would just have to hope I would be able to qualify for those as well \ud83d\ude2dthis entire process is so nerve racking",

It was so stressful sometimes without any support or friends who knew what to do.\n\nIt's worth looking around and emailing other unis in the UK, and it'll be cheaper to attend outside of London if you don't mind studying in a different part of the country.\n\nI would look into study abroad programs too, I did one at LSE and Kings had an agreement with my university here so I could pay tuition here but attend classes there (so it was covered by my scholarship). It's not exactly the same experience, but I still loved it. \n\nIf it's something you really want to do, I think you should go for it, even if it means a year or two of saving up. That's just me though, my whole family has been very supportive (but too poor to help \ud83d\ude41) and they've been talking me into it",

I'd say right now you should start thinking about your statement and who you want to be your reference. You can send the invitation to your reference any time, obviously earlier is better.  \n\n\nUCAS only lets you pick five schools, so unless you're totally set on King's (which is a great university and I'd totally get it if you were) you should do some research on other schools.   \n\n\nThe other parts of the application are pretty straightforward, it's just work and education history. Once you have everything finished there's a small fee (like 50 squids) and then just wait for a decision. I think KCL does interviews for nursing, but I don't know much about that process.  \n\n\nUsually Americans will get unconditional offers since we already have all of our grades. If you accept I think you're pretty much locked in. I got my offer within a week or two of applying (mid January). They gave me a link to apply for housing in May (iirc) and I  just got my CAS number today, which means I can now apply for a visa. King's is really good about holding events before all of the major milestones after you're admitted, so I won't get too into all of that here (but DM me if you ever have questions about the visa process or whatever, if you'd rather not ask KCL directly)",

My entry requirement was to obtain a 55444. In my offer letter, I was provided with a link that showed the list of entry requirements specifically for U.S. students. In this link, there was a list of combinations of SAT - Subject test, SAT (regular), and AP exams. In the list, I saw that I met one of the entry requirements which consisted of obtaining a 700 or above in SAT subject test, SAT at 1350, and one 5 and one 4 in AP exams. I emailed the sociology admissions team, asking them to update my offer. However, I got a response from them that I don't meet the entry requirements because KCL is not considering SAT subject test scores anymore.   \nHowever, recently I was also offered a conditional offer from the history and international relations department of KCL as well. The admissions officer updated my entry requirements from 55544 to receiving two 5's on AP exams, 700 or above in SAT subject test, and SAT at 1350.   \nDoes anyone know which department is right? The website doesn't mention anything about KCL not accepting SAT subject test scores anymore. Is KCL actually not accepting SAT subject test scores anymore? Was anyone able to change their entry requirements from only AP exam scores to a combination of AP scores, SAT subject test scores, and SAT score?   \nThank you!",

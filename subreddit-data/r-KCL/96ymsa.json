It is a private accommodation located near King\u2019s Cross St. Pancras Underground Station (just a couple of  tube stops to UCL, University of London, LSE, KCL, City University, Imperial). The room is a studio (sold out since May) and it has a weekly cost of \u00a3439. The tenancy agreement is for 2018-2019 (51 weeks) and the check-in is on the 11th of September.

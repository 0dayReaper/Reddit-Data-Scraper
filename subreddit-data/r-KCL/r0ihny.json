    "postText": "I understand that Moonraker Point (&amp; a whole load of other privately run student accommodations) were not licensed as HMOs, which they should have been. Southwark, where Moonraker is, had an Additional licensing scheme running up to end of December 2020 so anyone who was a paying rent there up to that date can apply for a Rent Repayment Order (RRO) for up to 12 months' rent. Moonraker is owned by Unite Group so does not qualify for the student accommodation  exemption from from HMO licensing. BUT: you'll have to apply by 30th December this year!  \nSame applies to other KCL properties run by other \"Operators\"  \nFor more information on RROs, see [https://www.GetRentBack.org](https://www.GetRentBack.org)",

            "comment": "Check out this for detail on HMO licensing (historically in this case): [https://www.londonpropertylicensing.co.uk/southwark](https://www.londonpropertylicensing.co.uk/southwark)\n\n&gt;\\-- Do I need a licence to rent out my property?\n\nFrom here: [https://www.kcl.ac.uk/accommodation/residences/moonraker-point](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/accommodation/residences/moonraker-point) It may be the 'Ensuite' rooms are more HMO than the 'Studio' rooms (as Studios are not sharing kitchens), but get a second opinion on this. Presume &lt;4 Ensuite rooms share a kitchen (and are therefore not Mandatory HMO scheme)(but are caught by the Additional HMO licensing scheme)?\n\nGood (but not necessary) to group together (at least) into groups around a shared kitchen for making your RRO (helps evidence each other's occupation). You can make a single application with many applicants (sharing the \u00a3300 application fee).\n\nYou would be RRO claiming for the period WHEN   \ni) you were renting (and resident) AND   \nii) the building should have had HMO AND   \niii) it did not have HMO licence.\n\nAs mentioned you have 12 months from when you last met those \\^ conditions (notionally when the building manager/your landlord was committing the offence of 'managing an unlicensed HMO') to make your [RRO application (to London FTT)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-rro1-application-by-tenant-or-local-housing-authority-for-a-rent-repayment-order-housing-and-planning-act-2016).\n\nYou may want to email the council to get written confirmation the building (or sub-components of the building) were not HMO licensed for the claim period.\n\nLink in the OP is a good source of information &amp; advice. Others are: citizens advice , various online guides including from councils.",

I don't understand why being owned by Unite Group would stop you from regarding Moonraker Point as student halls of residence). How do I make sure that Moonraker Point is not exempted?\n\nWhy those who want an RRO apply by 30th December this year? I'm just a little confused.\n\nThanks in advance.",

For Moonraker Point we have worked out that this belongs to Unite Group plc through a chain of Ltd companies. Southwark have conformed that it was not licensed: private operators are required to license their properties under the UNIPOL National Code.  \n\n\nFor the property to be licensable it must be in a Additional licensing scheme or Selective licensing scheme  area. Southwark, Moonraker's borough, had an Additional licensing scheme  which expired on 31/12/2020: you have 12 months under The Housing and Planning Act 2016 (HaPA) to apply for a RRO, so the deadline to apply is 30/12/2021. So long as you apply by that deadline you can apply for up to 12 months' rent that was paid prior to 31/12/2020",

    "postText": "I just received this email and I am not sure how to respond. My undergrad was already assessed in 0-100, but each teacher give the grade as they wish. My grad was with letters (A+, B...) and they said they don't have a conversion table.\n\nI will call KCL monday, but anyone else had similar request? \n\n\n\n\"Please provide a copy of a grading scheme detailing how your academic undergraduate and post graduate work was/is assessed.  If your transcript uses letter or descriptive grades (for example A+, A, B  or Excellent, Good, Average), we require your grading scheme to show the equivalent percentage scores used against these letter or descriptive grades.\"",

In order for those letters to be converted into numbers, a grading scale will be required - have you confirmed with your university that they are unable to produce any sort of doc that would provide a letter-to-GPA, letter-to-10point or letter-to-percentage conversion chart? \n\nAlso, just to confirm, your grad studies are a full-on Masters programme or a lato-sensu?",

The house is lovely, the room is a small box room. If you\u2019re interested let us know. This is super convenient for international students as it\u2019s 15 mins from Heathrow and all items can be stored over the summer or holiday periods. If you\u2019re looking to party this isn\u2019t the accommodation for you but if you\u2019re looking to live in a beautiful house and not worry about heating, food, hot water and be in fully alarmed accomodation and don\u2019t mind helping out please do get in touch. References are essential.",

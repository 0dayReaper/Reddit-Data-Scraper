Does this mean I am officially accepted?   \nI am an international student so I don't have much familiarity with the British system... Hopefully someone with more experience will know better.",

They replied back basically saying it means it\u2019s confirmed and I have nothing to do . But I did get an email yesterday evening about online enrolment but before that it was only ucas that had contacted me not kings so probably wait and they\u2019ll get to you x",

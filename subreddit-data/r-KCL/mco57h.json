    "postText": "Hey, I just got accepted into KCL Psychology for undergraduates. I applied during October 2020, but back then I wasn't confident if I wanted to go into the Neuroscience and Psychology course, so I applied for Psychology, just to be safe. Now that I'm more passionate in neuroscience + psych,  I'm not sure if I would email KCL now or discuss this with them in person once I've accepted the offer. \n\nThe two courses have the same grade requirements, (I'm taking IB) and I have a higher predicted than the course requirement. \n\nHas anyone else been in a similar situation, and how did you go about it?",

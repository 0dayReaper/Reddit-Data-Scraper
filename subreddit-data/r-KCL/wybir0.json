    "postText": "Hello Everyone; I'm an incoming International Student at KCL this Fall Term. I have received my unconditional offer from KCL on the 18th of August but haven't heard back from them regarding my CAS to register for the Student Visa. I'm getting worried since the orientation starting date of the Fall Term will be on the 19th of September. Does anyone also experience this issue?",

            "comment": "Hi. I am also an international student applying to KCL this year. My computer science course will commence on 26 Sept. Just finished A-Level and got my unconditional offer. I also have been in your place (late response from KCL team) \n\nThis is exactly what I did and I hope it will speed up your process.\n\n1. Message them on King's Apply during their working hour (around 9am London time)\n2. Message them via the 'read &amp; send messages' tab\n3. make sure to choose VISA QUERY category because KCL has entire different team doing CAS application and normal admission processes.\n4. Put your message subject as something engaging with all CAPS and make sure to start with the word 'URGENT'. Example : 'URGENT PLEASE READ VISA SCHEDULE TIGHT'. Or you can go with something else similar.\n5. No need to all CAPS anymore in text message. Text in polite manner and use forceful terms and wordings such as 'please' or 'desperate'.\n6. Attach any relevant documents if needed like your passport. \n7. Wait and don't spam too much messages.\n\nI've done all these steps and I got a reply within a day. I can't guarantee tho. I hope it also works for you and you will get your CAS as soon as possible. Goodluck my fellow KCL batch mate!\n\nYou can also contact your education agent or your school if they can provide you with some extra and emergency helps.",

Keep messaging on the \u201cread and send messages\u201d category, type the title in caps. Don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s priority visa option, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get yours by the 19th!",

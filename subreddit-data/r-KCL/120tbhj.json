    "postText": "Hey guys!  \nI'm starting to get a little bit nervous as I have still not heard from KCL... I applied in november for Law with spanish legal studies with 2023 entry. I have 39 ib points, 766 at HL and 23 LNAT. I know it's not the best but I would rather hear from them than axiously wait haha. Does anyone know why they might be taking so long?  \nAlso does anyone have the link to the acceptance / rejection spreadsheet?  \nThank you!",

            "comment": "Most people move out of student accommodation, and rent a flat. Normally you share like a 2-3 bed flat/house with some pals, but make sure you know them well before you commit to a long-term flatshare with them. You never know if they'll be a good or bad fit if you just casually know them. \n\nThe ideal for some people is to rent a flat/studio by themselves, but obviously that's much more expensive. \n\nI don't think KCL allows non-first years to stay at their accommodations, so if you want to stay in halls then you'll need to find private student halls, which are very expensive. So unless you're looking for the social aspect, it's cheaper to find a nicer individual flat for yourself.\n\nIn terms of looking for flats, the London housing market is wild and flats pop up all the time. I assume you'll be moving out some time in the summer, so start looking maximum 2 months before. Normally flats get rented out very quickly. I found my flat on one day, visited it the next day, moved in 3 days later.",

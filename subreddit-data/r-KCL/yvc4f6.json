    "postText": "Hi there\n\nIt\u2019s big John here. I am a married father of 4 children. I have recently found a bit of fame after having several viral videos on tik tok. The account on tik tok is https://www.tiktok.com/@willbatross and these viral videos have built me up a massive following which continues to grow.\nI am also well-followed on my Instagram account https://www.instagram.com/itsbigjohn. Both platforms show my home life, my love of Chinese and myself saying bosh.\nMy eldest son Johnny fisher is a professional heavyweight boxer for matchroom boxing and he has himself built up a huge following. His fans are part of the Romford Bull army as his nickname is the Romford Bull and they are known as bosh soldiers.\nI have become the leader of the bosh soldiers of the Romford Bull army. Anyone is welcome to become a bosh soldier, it is a light-hearted happy movement where everyone is welcome.\nIt is growing and growing and my fan base is growing with it. I don\u2019t know how long it will last but am enjoying the ride.\nI will be answering questions from 4pm on the 15th.\nBosh.\n\nPROOF: https://i.redd.it/wkiu5az0pvz91.jpg",

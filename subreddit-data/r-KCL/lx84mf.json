    "postText": "Hiya! Please don't mind us posting here, we'd just like to share our new startup! \n\nWe are UniDate, formerly UCLdate! Following our successful launch group involving more than 100 students at UCL, we\u2019re now aiming to incorporate more universities in London including LSE, Imperial and Kings' to make finding real, romantic matches easier for you! \n\nHow does this work? (For those who're hearing about us for the first time.)\n\nJust answer our 20 odd short multiple-choice questions, then we\u2019ll convert your answers to data, and match you with several people with who you\u2019ll be most compatible! And don\u2019t worry - everyone is guaranteed at least one match!\n\nIt\u2019s short, easy, fill it out today!\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdlO9KmffkBIpc-zoq5myZ3dpVv4iGdX73JDVzqUe3pF9x1Vw/viewform?usp=sf\\_link\n\nThe form closes at 6 pm on the 13th of March, so be sure to join before then and be in with the chance of meeting your potential soulmate \ud83d\udc40. Matches will then be sent out later via email on Sunday!\n\nPlease share and follow our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/DateUni for the latest news and updates, and please do get in contact us by messaging the page or emailing us at ucldate2021@gmail.com with any questions and feedback.",

            "comment": "Hey! I recently completed my Biomed degree at KCL and absolutely loved it. I didn\u2019t apply to the others you mention but can let you know a bit about KCL itself. \n\nYou join an initial common year one along with other bioscience students and complete core subjects. From second year onwards you can select your own modules to cater the degree to your specific academic interests (e.g. genetics, neuroscience, physiology). \nThe lecturers are specialists in their fields so I found them very engaging and passionate (especially from 2nd year onwards). \n\nOutside of academia there are a LOT of student societies and sports clubs so there\u2019s a lot of opportunities to socialise, find new hobbies and fulfil any altruistic aspirations you may have. \n\nPlease feel free to let me know any specific questions you may have!",

            "comment": "i actually studied at uom last year doing biochem and dropped out. i\u2019m currently at kcl in my first year of genetics and enjoy the teaching so much more. at manchester it was lots of independent study with minimal contact hours and in person practicals (some were online). contrast to that at kcl my timetable has been full of lectures, workshops (these have a more classroom feel where discussion is welcomed) tutorials and practicals. the practicals have lots of guidance as well as all of the coursework. \n\nmy experience at manchester may be a reflection of teaching in the aftermath of covid so you may want to take it with a pinch of salt/ maybe you could research into the experience of current first years at manchester to compare. one thing i will say about bioscience at manchester is that it\u2019s slightly more flexible module wise in the first year than kcl. at kcl everyone does the same modules you only get to choose from second years onwards whereas at uom you have a few modules to choose from in addition to the compulsory ones.\n\nhope this helps somewhat :)",

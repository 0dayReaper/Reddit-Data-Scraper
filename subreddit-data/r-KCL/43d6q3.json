    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am an American student who is applying to colleges in London. I've done a year of Community College and applied to a few colleges (UCL, KCL and ICL) via UCAS. I didn't expect to be accepted into any of them because I don't have any full qualifications or test scores.\n\nTo my surprise, King's College London gave me an unconditional offer to BSc in Neuroscience today.\n\nSo far I have been accepted into King's College, and University of California, Davis. I plan on continuing to get a medical degree at some point. I've read in a few threads that some employers 'look down on' degrees from KCL. Is this just someone spouting some bs?\n\nIn terms of location, London is an amazing city and I would love the opportunity to study there for a few years. However, I'm not sure how I would fit into the University as an American.\n\nAnyways, how do the two compare to each other for Neuroscience/neurobiology? Is there a significant difference that I should pay attention too? ",

What do you guys think about the Chemistry with Biomedicine course at King's? I know the department of chemistry at king's is a new one, but how good is the tuition of chemistry at king's?",

Most of the issues involving KCL mostly involves student life issues which is where it has taken a hit over the last few years.  I don't know how it compares to Davis.  \n\nGenerally though, the best way to figure out is try to figure out who works at both universities and see what they do.  One might be \"better\" than the other on rankings but the \"lower\" ranked one might actually be better suited for your career desires.  It doesn't matter how much better a university is if they don't have the stuff you need to help you with your career.",

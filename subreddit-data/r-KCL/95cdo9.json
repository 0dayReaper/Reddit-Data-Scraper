    "postText": "so I have recently received my offer from King's Residences, but, unfortunately, my KAAS application was not accepted and i am now stuck with an unaffordable 319 pounds offer for Moonraker Point. What i want to ask is, does anyone on this subreddit have any advice or suggestions on where i can look for private housing, something to rent. Ie, are there any places specifically targeted for freshers looking for private housing. Any general advice would be appreciated as well. Thanks in advance ",

    "postText": "Hello lovely humans! Would love to hear from you guys. Also, I applied through IB with a predicted of 666 and 39/45 when the requirement is 766 HL and 35/45, do I stand a chance? I know someone who got rejected this past week with the same score as mine, and I still haven\u2019t received an answer. Thanks all",

            "comment": "I'm sorry I only saw this now, but if it makes you feel better, I'm also an IB student who applied for Bsc Business Management, however, I applied with a predicted of 766 and 38/45. Happy to say that I got an offer roughly a month ago :) . \n\nHowever, I believe that simply due to the substantial number of applicants King's gets and the particular competitiveness of this degree, even meeting their entry requirements isn't always necessarily enough. From what I've understood, King's values your Personal Statement quite highly compared to other unis.\n\nFor instance, I also applied for Bsc Management at the University of Warwick and although I perfectly met their entry requirements of 766 and 38/45, I still got rejected.\n\nI hope you also managed to obtain an offer, but if King's hasn't yet responded and you think your Personal Statement was quite strong, they'll probably give you an offer",

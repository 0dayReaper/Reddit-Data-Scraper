I was wondering what all modules are good in terms of employability and how is the overall quality of teaching pertaining to this course.\n\nIf anyone has some experience, it can help me out a lot and if you can please do provide me with maybe more insights related to the overall experience of the course.\n\nThanks in advance!",

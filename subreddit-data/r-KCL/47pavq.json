    "postText": "As per title. Just wondering if anyone on this sub studies Classics/Classical Studies/etc. and how they'd rate the overall experience. I've a tough choice to make between Classics at KCL or Nottingham. The King's College department seems to be better but I'm concerned about the living costs of London and whether or not the big city will be socially isolating compared to a campus like Nottingham. \nI should add that -- due to having no ancient language qualifications -- I'm studying Classics via pathway B, that is, studying Classical Studies for my first year (with Latin from scratch), and thereafter joining the full Greek &amp; Latin programme.  \nAny insight would be much appreciated.",

            "comment": "The Classics department at Kings is very good, the lecturers and alumni are very supportive. If you have concerns over funding chances are Kings has something there for you to help - all students are poor unless they're rich kids.\n\nThe modules are good and if your're lucky archaeological investigation abroad (trips) happen sometimes.\n\nA month late, but hope that helps? Also you may as well email them, they won't take offence and even calling the lads would prove useful.\n\nNote: I frequent Kings and have done some short courses, am not full alumni in the sense of studying BA or MA&lt;.",

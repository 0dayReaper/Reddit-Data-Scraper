    "postText": "Hi, \n\nI intend to apply to a graduate program at KCL this December. However, I have a concern: the professor I need to provide the recommendation letter for the admission process would not be able to do it in late December or early January, which is the approximate period of receiving my transcripts. \n\nSo my question is this: will the links of referral/recommendation be sent as soon as I start the application process, or would I have to submit all of my documents (transcripts, personal statement, CV, ...) before they are sent to the referees? \n\nThank you.",

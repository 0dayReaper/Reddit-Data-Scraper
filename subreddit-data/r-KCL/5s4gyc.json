    "postText": "So I'll try to keep this short.\nMy friend is enrolled in KCL studying Nursing and he wants to drop out and study Film Studies and we were discussing about it and the best Film Studies degree in the London are is in KCL. He says he won't get in even if he has the grades because the moment he drops out from Nursing he won't be able to study Nursing ever again, not that he wants to, and that KCL would never give him a chance to enroll.\nI'm not from the UK, I know that your Unis are super competitive but I'm a little outside of things and I want to help him out. To whom can he talk in KCL to get more informations about changing fields of study ?\nIs there any general student union that can help students with this questions or anything KCL related department ?\nThanks in advance, I'm sorry for my broken English.",

See https://www.kclsu.org/advice/ (sorry I'm on my mobile and can't link). I would really recommend he goes here as soon as possible to get some advice.\n\n2) You'd be surprised about re-enrolling - I had a friend at KCL who dropped out/did badly on the same course THREE TIMES and they let him back in each time. They won't care if he's dropped out from nursing, it depends whether they want him or not.\n\n3) He could talk to his personal tutor, or ask the Compass (university people who can provide information about College procedures). He won't be disadvantaged for doing so. See http://www.kcl.ac.uk/campuslife/services/the-compass/index.aspx for the latter.\n\nGood luck! It's a big change so I hope it's the right one for him. Encourage him to ask the student union or his personal tutor.",

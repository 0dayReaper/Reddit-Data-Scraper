    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been accepted into the **Masters in Public Health at King's College London** as well as **Masters in Global Health at University College London**.\n\nI'm still not sure which program shall I go for, I come from a medical background( Medical Doctor- class of 2021) and I aim to incorporate some academic/research work into my future clinical career, after finishing my residency training.\n\nanyone who can share their opinion on this or previous experience with KCL/UCL? ( Coursework, dissertation, career opportunities...etc)?\n\nTIA!",

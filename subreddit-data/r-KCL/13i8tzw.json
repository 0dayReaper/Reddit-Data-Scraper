I\u2019m planning on trying to appeal with the admissions committee. \n\nI think you can do the same! Just explain your situation &amp; highlight your experience.",

Can\u2019t guarantee anything! But yeah this is the procedure :) hope this helps!",

I got a 38 with a 765, and they rejected me from both offers because 765 is not 666 minimum although one would assume they might be equivalent. \n\nHave faith in yourself for exams, work hard - but do have a good backup option.",

    "postText": " Hello, I'm an abroad student from Ireland thinking of applying to KCL, but after reading into student reviews etc. I am absolutely confused. I understand that obviously, a highly ranked college would be very stressful. However there's a whole slew of other things as well about how bad the college is. The university seemed fine (I'm looking to apply into biomedicine or biology), but no student seems to have a single good thing to say about it, I'm really worried now, is the university as bad as people say? Is the biomed course good?",

            "comment": "I studied at KCL (MSc though). I took it for granted at the time, but it\u2019s worth it getting to learn from some of the greats in their field. Especially if you are looking into a Bio-related degree. It\u2019s brilliant if you are looking to get involved in research as well, good place to network. \n\nThe uni admin can be a nightmare most times but it really depends on your priorities, so what you want out of the experience (as mentioned already). Most negative reviews are usually focused on this too. But the constant exposure to interesting opportunities academically at KCL made me forgive them for their lack of dialogue with their student body. \n\nThe location of course added to my experience (have a soft spot for the libraries in Strand and Guys campus). \n\nSo it all depends on what you are looking for, personally I enjoyed my time even though it was far from perfect.",

Personally my friends and I all loved the university, but the administration can be nightmares (they don\u2019t reply and can be very inconsistent with their advice). But if you\u2019re looking for a great university and education then Kings is well worth it!",

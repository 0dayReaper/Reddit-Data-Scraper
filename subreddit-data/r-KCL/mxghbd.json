Hopefully it was your first choice :) I still haven't heard anything ughhh, but, my reference didn't complete her portion until a few days after the deadline so maybe that means my application was pushed back a bit. \\*hopefully\n\nThank you for letting me know!",

The only one I didn't receive an offer on was Conflict, Security, and Development.\n\nI knew that my BA scores were slightly under what was required for War Studies, and Conflict, Security, and Development, but I still thought it was worth applying for two reasons.\n\nThe first being that I had attended Oxbridge, and as stupid as it is Oxbridge is still a big name. The second was that I had suffered serious health issues during my undergrad degree, which undoubtedly affected my overall grade. This was brought up by my academic reference, who mentioned how often I produced high 2.i/1:1 level work when I wasn't suffering health issues, and also in my personal statement.\n\nI applied for National Security Studies as my backup as they only require a 60, and what I learnt during my MA was that nearly all the MAs offered in the department are the same. The only differences come from a single core module.",

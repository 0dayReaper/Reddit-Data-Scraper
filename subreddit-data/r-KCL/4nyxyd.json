    "postText": "I guess the best place to start is the beginning. \n\nSo I've been accepted to two excellent universities - the University of Toronto in Canada (for Humanities, more specifically English) and Kings College London in England (for Law). \n\nFor most of my life and at the moment, I live in Canada with my dad, stepmom, and siblings. My mom, however, lives in England with my stepdad and other batch of siblings. I typically stay with her for 3-4 months of the year during school-breaks, so I have a good idea (I think) of what it would be like to live in England on a cultural scale. \n\nI have absolutely no issue with what it would be like were I to go to KCL and stay with her. On the other hand, my dad and I fight constantly and share none of the same moral/political beliefs (he's racist, homophobic, sexist, extremely controlling, etc). \n\nOn a purely surface level, I want to go to U of T. Despite the fact that it would mean staying in the same city as my dad, I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that I understand exactly what university life would be like at U of T. Disregarding that I would also be closer to my friends rather than having to make new ones, when it comes to extra-curriculars, knowing what the class structure is like, I know the system inside-out. I know that you form your own schedule using their systems, get to see which ones have tutorials, how large those tutorials are, how large the lectures are, what times the lectures are at, all in advance. I like that a lot. I know that as a first year I could write for the student paper, The Varsity, and I know exactly how to apply. I know that every year there is a kind of elite seminar class held by an established Canadian author, not for credit, but rather for interest. I know which clubs I'd want to attend already, the big events that my college hosts, and so on and so on. I already feel at home at U of T. And Toronto, furthermore, is my hometown. I know which restaurants are cool that have just opened up, which bars don't card, where you can go if you want cheap food, how to get from one side to the other in under twenty minutes. \n\nI think the biggest thing that keeps me from wanting to go to KCL, is that it's this huge enigma to me. What clubs are even there, what's the social scene like? Is it more common to have house parties, or are there frats, or do people go to bars? How would I even meet people? What's the academic structure like - can you meet the profs after class? When do you find out your schedule? I'm under the belief that, as a law student, my schedule is already preset with 4 modules and no electives. I'm fine with that, but how many lectures are there, how many tutorials, how busy is the schedule? Is there a student paper and can first years get involved? Hell, what is the nickname for first-years, even? In Canada we call them frosh. I feel like I'm walking in the dark. \n\nWhichever school I go to is where I will end up staying. If I go to KCL, I'm going to apply for permanent settlement and move to the UK so I can practice law there and be with my mom. So I'm not just deciding where I'm going to study, I'm deciding where I'm going to live for the rest of my life. \n\nI think there's a part of me that really wants to go to KCL. I love England, love London, would much rather live with my mom over my dad. My dad has refused to support me going to university whatsoever, to the point where he won't even give me his tax information so I can apply for financial help (which even my guidance counsellor has said is just plain spiteful as it has no impact on him). My mom, on the other hand, is willing to do whatever she can to help me. \n\nBecause of applying for visas and needing to find funds and etc, I want to figure this out ASAP. But I feel like I need some advice. I know this is kind of personal for this subreddit, but I couldn't figure out where else to post. \n\nHelp me, Reddit, you're my only hope. \n\nTL;DR: Which university should I go to? Which country should I live in? \n\nP.S. Is there a facebook group for KCL students? I haven't been able to find any. ",

            "comment": "Hi there. I'm a British student that has just graduated from KCL. This sub is super inactive so you'll be lucky to get many responses!\n\nThis is obviously a difficult decision. One thing I would initially say is that university is a time to push yourself and go outside your comfort zone. You know the UofT really well, your friends are here, you know what to expect. Great - so why not throw yourself in the deep end and do something entirely different? It will be difficult and confusing perhaps at first, but that's character building and law firms will respect that decision. I hope you know what I mean, sometimes its important not to do what is easiest.\n\nKCL is a very well respected university, and the law dept is particularly good. Being at university in London is great because there are so many resources - every library item you could possibly need, and of course tonnes of law firms are based there if you want summer expreience. KCL is part of the University of London and has access to their libraries too (and the libraries of other colleges there). Law degrees might be better for getting a job but I really don't know. \n\nI actually know a Canadian who studied Law at King's (friend of a friend so not that well). He seemed to have a great time. One thing I have heard is that the Law dept can get a little split up socially between native English speakers (British, Canadian, Americans mostly), Europeans (there's a lot that come here, as EU citizens they have the right to study here visa-free) and Asians (bear in mind the vast majority will have come directly from China etc, they are not British-Asians and therefore culturally quite differnt). You may find that your friendship group here is limited to the Anglosphere! However that is just testimony from people I know, it might not be the case in every year.\n\nHowever, the good news is that there are lots of groups/clubs to join. British universities do not have frats, but they do have a lot of interest groups. There are many different sports and socities to join - see kclsu.org/societies for more info (this is the Kings College London Student Union, which funds the university-affiliated clubs). Plus, it's a big city, there are opportunities to meet people everywhere.\n\nOne problem I experienced with KCL is the lack of campus. This will be in contrast to most North American universities which I think have more of a collegiate, close campus feel. KCL's teaching is split up between many buildings in the city, and the halls of residence are nowhere near each other. Many people just go in for lectures, then leave without getting to know anyone because there is sometimes a poor sense of community. But this doesnt have to be the case - if you try hard to make friends on your course, or in a club, you will be rewarded. But bear in mind it will feel very different to UofT - people dont eat in the university building, watch university sports games or really hang out there. People do go to the student bar but in a city like London many choose not to. University is only one aspect of many students lives, rather than living and breathing their campus identity.\n\nIf you have the money, you might want to consider applying to live in halls of residence during your first year (around \u00a3150-\u00a3180 a week depending on where you are). This is the place where most students make their best friends, and you will find it easier to socialise if you do. Remember the lack of community - this will feel worse if you are not in halls. You can then live with your mom after first year (students generally only live in halls for one year). I dont want to scare you - many students live at home and are fine, but in the first few weeks/months most people with hang out with their dorm mates.\n\nIf you do choose KCL, sometimes you can study abroad for a semester/year (but possibly not in Law, you'd have to check) and the University of Toronto is a destination option! I have a couple of friends who studied there. So maybe you could go to both - check whether the UofT sends exchange students to London!\n\nI was in Humanities, but from my experience you need to be proactive with your profs. Email them, book a slot to go and see them. They will be pleased to talk to you but they won't seek you out if you don't make an effort. They're very busy of course, but if you create a relationship with them you will benefit (not with your grades though, they're anonymously marked!).\n\nNightlife - most students go out to clubs and have drinks at their apartment beforehand. Many people have house parties but not as big as on a campus. Bars in London are very expensive so most won't go out anywhere fancy. \n\nThere's a student paper called Roar (our mascot is a lion) and a wider London Student newspaper. You can get involved with the paper or even the radio, they are very welcoming I believe. You get your schedule kind of late but I think you can choose modules at least in second and third year. 1st years are called freshers but most people wouldn't refer to them as that outside the first few weeks. There aren't as many traditions at a university like this.\n\nHope that helps a little bit. The decision is entirely yours and I'm sure you have a gut feeling about what is right. You will do absolutely fine in London but there are lots of things to weigh up - learning how things work here is part of the experience and we have SO MANY international students who are in the same position. In any case, I'm sure you will do well at either. Happy to answer any questions, and if there's anything specific you want to know I can ask my other friend who just graduated from KCL Law! :)\n",

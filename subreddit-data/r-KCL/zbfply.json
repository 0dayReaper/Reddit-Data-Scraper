    "postText": " \n\nAs the title suggests, i'd like to hear from any students who have any knowledge about the experience of studying CS at kcl.\n\nI'm going to apply in the coming week and well I've been having second thoughts on kcl because I've read a few threads which may be outdated by now.\n\nI heard about KCL not being the strongest when it comes to concepts such as machine learning, artificial intelligence and etc. also saw a few posts saying the satisfaction is lower at KCL and it is less guaranteed to land up a good job.\n\nI have to choose between Warwick, king's, and Imperial, but Imperial's A-level requirements don't accept ICT as an A-level subject, so ig applying there won't make sense since i took up IT, maths and econ in my a levels.\n\nI would've chosen Warwick over KCL ofc but it's not near the city and thus has lesser job exposure.\n\nEither way, I'd appreciate it if you guys could help me out!",

If you want to work all day, learn theoretical concepts down to the core and become a software engineer then kings is perfect.",

There has been a push towards more ML recently though.\n\nHowever, that being said, I don't know how it compares to Warwick. Tbh I think the only unis with especially strong ML programmes are UCL and Cambridge. Everywhere else seems roughly the same at the undergrad level.\n\nAs for job opportunities - that totally depends what you want to do. If you work hard you will be well placed to succeed at Kings or Warwick.",

            "comment": "I'm having a tough time making friends too, but here's some tips I use which seem to be working.\n\n1. Sit next to someone different each time during in-person class, and make an effort to strike up a conversation with them. \"Hi, I'm \\[insert name here\\], what's your name\" is a great start, continue with \"I'm doing \\[name of course\\], you?\" after they reply.\n2. Arrive early for class so you can chat with the people waiting outside. Hang around outside after class, as people seem to linger and converse.\n3. Don't get drunk, you may seem more sociable drunk, but drunk you isn't the real you. \n\nJust take it easy, things will come. If anything social-wise goes south, just remind yourself that your primary responsibility in uni is to study, and focus on academics instead.",

Some are more predisposed to it than others.\n\nI don't want to sound like a cynic, but uni tends to be a profoundly lonely time. Over time you will meet people. Going to events with alcohol is fine (my friend calls it \"social lubricant\" lmao), but if you can't meet someone without drinking until you are drunk then maybe look into where those anxieties come from too. Getting drunk with people you are already friends with is better :). Honestly, going to therapy helped me figure out what I want in friends and how to foster those relationships. I have experienced some loneliness at King's too. Shoot me a DM and we can talk about it.",

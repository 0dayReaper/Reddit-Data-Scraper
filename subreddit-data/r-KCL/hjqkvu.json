            "comment": "Hello, I studied biomedical science at King's 3 years ago.\n\nIn second year I took the important neuroscience modules that overlapped with the Neuroscience BSc. I can say that they were the most enjoyable lectures I had because of how they approached breaking down the concept and how practical work interplayed with lectures.\n\nBy the end of it you will have an excellent fundamental understanding of all aspects of neuroscience: Development, sensory &amp; motor nervous system, neuroanatomy, special senses, neurobiology, even philosophy. \n\nMoreover in third year the modules go into very specific details, as the heads of modules are the experts in those fields. \n\nI don't know if they are told to teach without further instructions but. The content is delivered by experts in that field so they can always answer your questions.\n\nI now study medicine at Leicester and find myself going back to those neuroscience KCL lectures to cover the gaps, because they did such a good job of going into detail about the fundamentals. I can also see the major quality difference in other administration and management issues between king's and where I am now.  \n\nI also genuinely miss KCL and the whole vibe of the university, very social, dozens of opportunities and societies to make new friends, London is full of things to do, museums to visit, bars and restaurants to explore. \n\nWithout a shadow of you will not regret doing Neuroscience, or any Bio related degree at kings.",

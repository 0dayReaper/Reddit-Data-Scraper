I received an email from KCL advising me to check the application website for an update, but there is none :( \n\nThe last time I received this type of email was in February, and I provided the additional information required. But today I am not sure what is going on.  \n\n\nThanks if you have any thoughts about it, Have a good evening!!  \nSimon.",

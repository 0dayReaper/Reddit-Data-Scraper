    "postText": "I recently received/accepted an offer for an International Relations MA. I am planning to drop a class at my current institution which is an elective that I don\u2019t need to graduate. Dropping the class won\u2019t impact my GPA, so I should be able to maintain it. In your experience, is this enough for KCL to rescind the offer? I\u2019ve been trying to get an answer directly through the message from my application for about a week with no response. On a similar note, I\u2019ve been trying to get a hold of someone for weeks that isn\u2019t an automated email about funding and visas since I\u2019m an international student. Do you have any recommendations? Thanks!",

            "comment": "I wasn\u2019t exactly in the same boat during my final semester at my undergrad in America, I withdraw from a class after applying to UCL because I got a 4 out of 100 on a handwritten law midterm when I forgot to provide the accommodation memo to the professor to type my exam due to my dyspraxia which I pretty much never needed to use. ( I think it\u2019s called in the UK) I was already maxed out on credits I didn\u2019t need that class, he was like too late you can type the next one. I also may have made the mistake of being political when most students in this uni in New York don\u2019t tolerate opposing not just views but even ideas, and it was graded by the young TA not the professor. We had a distinguished professor who was the only conservative in the department and retired due to the political climate in academia. My handwriting is bad but I doubt she couldn\u2019t actually read it. Anyway I got a conditional offer after graduating which I already met and that was it. Didn\u2019t matter at all. Fortunately I had no problem meeting the conditional offer even bombing 2 finals ending with 2 B- 3 A. My conditional offer for kings isn\u2019t too hard to hit but I gotta make up for term 1 a little. \n\nAlso where are you from? If you\u2019re from USA very straight forward and simple. I feel sorry for my friends in China and India however.",

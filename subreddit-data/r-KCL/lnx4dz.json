    "postText": "hi! im a student from singapore who got a conditional offer to KCL's History BA. The conditions given were AAA for A Levels at the H2 level, but I got ABC for my H2s and AA for H1s.\n\ngiven that my A was in History and my worse grades were in subjects unrelated to my course, like Economics and Math, is it worth a shot to contact them for an appeal? And if so, should I call/email them asap, or wait to see if they rescind my offer before going through Clearing?\n\nsome mitigating circumstances i can think of include my research experience in History at the advanced H3 level, for which I attained a Merit certification. i also broke my finger earlier in the year and have hand tremors which are legitimate obstacles in my written examinations, but I'm not sure if they'll view that as a flippant excuse lol.\n\ni really want to keep my place here so any help is greatly appreciated! thank you so much in advance :)",

Its the top 3 H2s (and of course meeting the other grades requirements like a pass in GP). I also believe that your finger accident should have been reported for special consideration during the exam period itself.\n\nI wish you all the best in ur app!",

I don't know what your H system is (sorry!) but if they're broadly equivalent to A-Levels, as the offer suggests, then you might be lucky. They allowed some people to enter thst I know of with ABB at A level *but* that was for immediate entry after summer exams, so a different situation to you. As I say, it's absolutely worth a shot but look into what other options you have as well.",

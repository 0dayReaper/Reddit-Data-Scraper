    "postText": "I will be moving from Los Angeles and starting a master's program at KCL in Sept. (I studied in London for 4 months during undergrad, so I'm not a total stranger to the city, but it's been 2 years.)\n\nI need advice about location! Option 1: 4-person flat at Orchard Lisle. It's 10 mins from waterloo campus by tube or 30 min walk! \n\nOption 2: 3bed 2 bath house in Canada Water area. My room would have an en suite, there's also a lounge and standard size kitchen and back garden and it's 15 mins from campus via Jubilee. \n\nHowever, I'm concerned the Rotherhithe area may not just be quiet, but a ghost town. I don't mind this atmosphere for studying, but I'm concerned that I'll have to commute a ways to do anything including grocery shopping. Is this true? \n\nI'm quite social and like to hang out with friends, but also like to come back home to my own space. \n\nDoes anyone have any experience with living in either of these areas? Any suggestions?",

I heard socially it can be quite difficult because they flats are pretty small. To be honest, I lived in dorms my first two years of undergrad and I wasn't really looking for that again. That's why I was willing to do Orchard Lisle. It seemed similar to an on campus apartment type situation, which I did my last two years in undergrad and really liked. I'm concerned that not having a common area in the flat will pretty much confine me to my room when I want to relax and the rooms don't seem that big... However, you're so right the location is everything there. \n\nAt the other place I would be 5 min walk from CW tube station. But ya then there's the lack of entertainment... I'm leaning toward the house and just dealing with taking the public transport everywhere, but I don't know.",

I think I could hang with that. But yes I was glad to get OL so I didn't have to deal with 18 year old college freshmen. I'm so sorry lol. \nI did see the common areas are basically the little bean bag thing, which means I can't really have people over or regularly relax outside of my room without using the hall common room? I think I might feel a bit strange living in that environment again even if we're all grad students. However, if I stay at the CW house may have comfort, but I'll miss out on meeting all of those people. :/\n",

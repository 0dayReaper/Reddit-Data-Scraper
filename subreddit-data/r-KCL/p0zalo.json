    "postText": "Hi guys, I just received an occupational health clearance for my course pharmacy. I missed my offer by 1 point in my higher level subjects for IB which was a 655, when I needed a 665. If this clearance email came today, does that mean my offer is now unconditional or what does this mean?",

    "postText": "Hi. I am an international student and i will be studying biomed. i got an unconditional offer from Kings    \n which is a very appealing choice. and i got offers from other unis in other countries. i do love London but everything there, studying there is all unknown for me as an international student. i am really conflicted rn and the application for accommodation in Kings is about to start. So can anyone give me comments on the course in Kings ? like the intensity of work, teaching quality, etc. Thank you sooooo much.",

Teaching quality is top notch, you\u2019re taught by leading academics and if you get above 60% on average for year 1 and \n2 they\u2019ll allow you to do your dissertation with one of the research teams. It\u2019s a surreal experience as your supervisor will be probably a researcher that is revered in the scientific community, and also that you\u2019ll be part of grounding breaking research. It\u2019s very cool.",

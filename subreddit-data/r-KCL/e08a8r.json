I got placed in the residence Champion Hill, but it's super far and I was wondering if it's worth it to accept the offer or to just find somewhere else to live. Any experiences with champion hill would be appreciated A LOT!!! Mostly opinions on what the area is like :) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks!",

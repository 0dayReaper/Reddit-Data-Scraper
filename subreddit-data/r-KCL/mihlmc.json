    "postText": "Is Biomedical Sciences at King's worth it?\n\nAfter getting rejected in my medical applications this year, I am stuck with no choice as 3 of my UCAS applications went to Biomedical Sciences. The three were: King's College London, Queen Mary University London and St George's University. I was accepted into all three of them.\n\nMy following questions are :\n\n1) Looking into the IBMS accreditation, **King's College doesn't seem to be accredited by the institute**. My worry is that ,**without the accreditation** I won't be able to land any career in the NHS as a Biomedical Scientist.\n\n**Is there any steps that I personally need to take after my course at King's to become accredited?**\n\n**Does King's offer any support to students who don't see themselves wanting to do a career in research and are leaning more towards wanting to work closely with the public sector( NHS)?**\n\n\n2)  For students who have done their course or are currently doing their course at King's, what are the job prospects that a Biomedical Science student can get after completing their course? (I only know two of them, research scientist working in private companies ie. GSK and registered Biomedical Scientist working at the NHS). **It will be much helpful if I know of broader areas this degree covers, so it doesn't feel like I am stuck in a dead end**",

            "comment": "I did this degree 4 years ago. Biomed at king's is centred around making you a good researcher and a good candidate for a masters and PHD with a future in research, i remember within the first few days we had a lecture about what your question and essentially you will need to do another course at your own time to get accredited. \n\nI am doing medicine now at another uni and I can guarantee that biomed at king's is really good bu tif you want to work for the NHS and not research then it maybe not for you. But I cannot speak highly enough on how good the degree is if you want to stay in research.",

Moonraker point (if it is still available) is known for being social but having a higher number of international students and post grads. \n\nAlso you might be eligible for KAAS which caps the price you pay for accommodation but these are only available at Stamford street and GDS I think! \n\nI know angel lane is social but it is quite far out and so you lose out a little bit on socialising with people in other accommodations. \n\nStamford street and GDS also have access to their gyms on site for no extra cost so I\u2019d definitely say these are the best to go for!!",

And if you have got the KAAS, just choose the most expensive accommodation that is available for KAAS. (No matter how expensive your accommodation is, KAAS students only need to pay \u00a3169 per month).\n\nIf you aren't eligible for KAAS, then probably Stamford Street apartments or Great Dover Street, these 2 are the best in terms of cost-efficiency (they are also famous and selling fast! so be sure to get it quick). But if you prefer to be more comfortable and doesn't care about the price, any accommodation will surely do. All KCL accommodation are under the King's Residence, which means they all have good social events occurring on all of the accommodations provided. No need to worries. KCL Accommodation website also provides you with all of the information regarding each accommodation. So you can browse and have a look if you want.",

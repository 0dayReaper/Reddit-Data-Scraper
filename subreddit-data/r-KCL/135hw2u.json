    "postText": "Does anyone know if it\u2019s possible to change accommodation after I\u2019m 18? At the moment, I\u2019m only allowed to live in SSA or GDS because I\u2019m under 18 at the point of moving in but will turn 18 just 4 days after i move in. Does anyone know if it\u2019s possible for me to move accommodation after that? I\u2019m really keen on Garden Hall right now because it\u2019s catered.\n\nWhat are the restrictions like for under 18s? Will I be sectioned off in a separate area of the residence? Will it be harder to socialize?",

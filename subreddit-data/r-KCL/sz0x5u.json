Walking to class/library rather than having to take the bus or tube sort of thing.\n\nStill, there's cheaper options available, especially if you don't have too many actual on campus activities",

It all really comes down to your location, so I can only recommend a few providers you can look at based off your campus requirements. MyStudentHalls can help you sort through the available options based off your budget, location, etc. Very handy. \n\nUniteStudents, this is the one Moonraker is under. Their services are great, and facilities are good. Aside from the ones under Kings, they've got a few more scattered around London. \n\nChapters, is a bit away from the city center, so some services might be harder to come by. From what I've heard their facilities are pretty good.\n\niQ is another option, but I've heard a few nasty things about their customer service, but it was just one person, so take with a grain of salt.\n\nMyStudentHalls can help you sort through the available options based off your budget, location, etc.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I'm a KCL student from the informatics department specifically CS and last year I started a project to build my own 6502 computer system. At first I wanted to do this entirely alone and at the moment I do have an alpha revision of the board and I've put in an order for the chips to build and start testing. However, after two years I've realised that I need some help with the system. Specifically the design of three chips. If anyone here has any experience in designing chips or FPGAs and would like to help, please DM me. I would be more than happy to share my current design and specifications for the chips as well as their purpose and the end goal of the project",

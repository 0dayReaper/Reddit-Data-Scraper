But even if it\u2019s just international\u2019s who are in the halls, you will make tons of life long friends living in halls together. Doing crazy and fun things\n\nRented accommodation you never know what your going to get. Could be first years or could be 3rd years who already have friends and don\u2019t really want to hang with a 1st year so harder to make mates.\nOr could not even be a uni student in your private accommodation so way less fun.\n\nIn halls you will learn to do things for yourself And the people you meet will all be doing the same. \n\nFor first year, halls is amazing experience",

My understanding is that although the lectures will be online, it is still possible that there will be tutorials or seminars in-person (in small groups). For those of you coming on Tier 4 visas, if they do hold them in person (and don't make them optional), you'll need to show up... Guess we will see what happens.",

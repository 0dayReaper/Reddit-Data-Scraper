As a Londoner myself, I hope to be able to represent issues Londoners face on a much deeper and personal level should I be elected.\n\nThe MHoC (Model House of Commons), is a political role-play community and subreddit with almost 3,000 members. \n \nThe Liberal Democrats of MHoC are a liberal, centrist and broad church political party, ranging from social-liberals to centrists to economic liberals. We stand for building a free and fair society, with opportunity for all.\n \nWe have already delivered a Digital Bill of Rights, putting an end to the Snooper's Charter issue, and have also [extended same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland](https://www.reddit.com/r/MHOL/comments/3qnctm/b172_results_and_committee_stage/). We are legislating to deal with the issue of secularisation, as well as terrorism laws.\n \nOne of our proudest achievements has been reforming welfare, replacing the vast majority system with Basic Income. The Liberal Democrats are committed to this level of progressivism, and we will legislate like this in the next term.\n \nNext term, we would like to pass our terrorism laws relaxation, which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MHOC/comments/43dhey/lb018_terrorism_minor_modifications_bill_first/), devolve power to our Home Nations and also introduce the Federalisation of the United Kingdom.\n \nBut we need your help for this. Last time, we received 18/115 seats - an impressive feat. But this time around, the Parliament is more splintered, with extreme radicals on both the right and left. It is the Liberal Democrats which offer the pragmatic solution.\n \nWe'd really appreciate your vote, and it only takes a short moment. And if you're interested in joining the Liberal Democrats, [sign up here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MHOC/comments/41tznv/join_a_party/?sort=new). Thank you for your time.\n \n*If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to comment below.*\n\n[Our Manifesto](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G3EU1iB113bIbnXsqE3V8MScj04vp2Tnld96RskwVds/edit?usp=sharing)\n \n----\n \n#[CLICK HERE TO VOTE](https://www.reddit.com/r/MHOC/comments/46xtgq/general_election_v_megathread/)\n \n---\n\nIF you never want to receive or see this advert again, please message /u/Padanub to be added to our Blacklist",

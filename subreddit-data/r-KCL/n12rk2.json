    "postText": "\nHey guys,\n\nLittle background- I completed my A levels in 2018, a foundation prorgramme in 2018-19, then started undergrad but took a gap year in 2020-21. I\u2019m currently studying BSc Banking and Finance online at University of London International Programmes, however, I\u2019m not enjoying it at all. I, thus, applied for a second year transfer (international) to LSE and first year entry into Kings College London. \n\nGot rejected from LSE and have an unconditional from KCL. I originally never wanted to start over coz I thought it was crazy, but now that I\u2019m rejected from lse, and really really don\u2019t want to study online for two more years, I\u2019m wondering if I should start over at KCL. Could you guys advice on what I should do? I\u2019m unable to decide. I\u2019ll be turning 21 this year and all my friends will graduate while I start Univeristy this year( if I go to KCL). And I feel I\u2019ll be too old to graduate by 2024. Do you guys think it\u2019s worth spending an extra year at uni for better quality education, on-campus life, London life, internships, better opportunities, etc. what do u guys think? \n\nThanks in advance \ud83d\ude42",

            "comment": "Tough choice, but I personally value time more than enjoyment. So I wouldn\u2019t waste another year to start over. However, if you are sure that you\u2019ll graduate poorly or can\u2019t seem to continue, please do transfer. \nMake sure to have clear mind on what you prioritise, understand the consequences, and then choose.",

            "comment": "I left a degree at the University of Nottingham after completing 2 years of a 4 year degree because I was unhappy. I took a gap year to Spain to figure out what I wanted to do with my life and eventually decided I wanted to study a different course in London. I got an offer from KCL at 21 in 2018 and will finally be graduating this year.\n\nI often questioned whether I made the right decision, maybe I should have just finished my 1st degree and then did a Masters in what I truly wanted to go into but I am glad I made the decision I did and have not regretted it even for a split second. A lot of my friends had graduated when I started at KCL but honestly the time flies by so quickly, I still feel like I only started this degree yesterday.\n\nUltimately, no one can really tell you what the best thing for you to do would be. I know that I made the right decision for me because changing degree programme and university has put me on a path that better aligns with my future goals. Had I stuck with my previous course, I probably wouldn\u2019t have finished with a good grade and/or would have been completely clueless about what to do next. So I guess you could think about what the outcome might be if you stay on a programme that you are not enjoying. I also think that everyone should go to the best university they can given how expensive it is.\n\nI hope this helps :)",

I wanted to go somewhere regarded as prestigious in my department so that\u2019s why I picked kings and I don\u2019t regret. I also wanted to live in central london and the kings campus couldn\u2019t be more perfect. I definitely wish the faculty had been more helpful in some ways, but overall it wasn\u2019t a big enough negative for me to regret the experience. I hope that helps!!! \u2764\ufe0f",

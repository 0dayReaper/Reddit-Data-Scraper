    "postText": "Dear King's students,\n\nnext year I'll have the opportunity to do my specialisation in transnational law (I'm studying law in Germany) at the Center for Transnational Legal Studies (CTLS), a joint venture between Georgetown, KCL, NUS and Melbourne and others. Since CTLS is located in King's and King's is also a partner uni, I would love to hear your experiences in case you have been there yourself/know people who were. From what I know, it seems like a cool programme, the only thing I'm currently wondering is how the grading scale works and especially how difficult it is to get a 4.5-5.0. In Germany, max points are never given and very good students achieve low double-digit scores on our 18-point grading scale (you're passing with honours if you get a 9). How does this work there? Is it possible to achieve a 4.5 or 5.0 if you are a good student or is it the same as here with top grades just not being given?",

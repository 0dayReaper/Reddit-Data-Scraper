But after messaging them back with URGENT in the title, fortunately I got a response in 2 days.\n\nKCL admission admins are so horrendously bad just for your information. anything else about KCL is awesome though.\n\nAnd dont spam message them too. Try waiting 1 week atleast before messaging again.",

I applied for masters in neuroscience to KCL and I got the offer.\n\nI would like to know if it\u2019s a good opportunity that I should take upon. How are the jobs in UK?\n\nCan someone share their insights on this please!",

I go to UCL currently even more international than Kings and it seems most internationals plan on going back home when their education is done. I plan on working and residing in both London and the US in the future.",

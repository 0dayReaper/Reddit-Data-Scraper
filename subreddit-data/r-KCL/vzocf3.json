    "postText": "Hi everyone! EasyA and Polkadot are hosting a 2-day student hackathon on the 30th and 31st of July 2022! This is an in-person event, held at Kachette, in London. I am a Bristol student helping organise this event.\n\nThis event is open to any UK student and does not require any previous experience. Students should participate in teams, of approximately 2-5 students. There are roles involved in design and presentation rather than coding, and anyone can have fun! It\u2019s an amazing chance to learn something new and exciting. You will get the chance to learn more about blockchain from experienced developers. There is also a massive prize pool! Yep, there are over $25000 in prizes to be won! \n\nThis is a great opportunity to get an experience which can make you stand out at university and job applications. Also, it's a fantastic way to just have some fun! \n\nTo sign up, fill in the form at this link: [https://forms.gle/Na4UtQbzMDWeyykZ6](https://forms.gle/Na4UtQbzMDWeyykZ6)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is some more information! \n\nWhy is it the best hackathon EVER?\n\n\u2705 WIN $25,000 prize pool\n\n\u2705 FREE to enter (and FREE Food + Drinks)\n\n\u2705 Awesome venue\n\n\u2705 Make new friends and chat blockchain/crypto!\n\n\u2705 Support from experts available throughout\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat kind of experience do I need?\n\n\ud83d\udcbb None!

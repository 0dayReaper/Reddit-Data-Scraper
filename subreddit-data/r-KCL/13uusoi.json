    "postText": "Recently, I was planning to apply to be an Event Assistant for the 24 June Strand Campus Open Day. I am planning to submit my job application through the King's Talent Bank System. According to the King's Talent Bank System, the closing date for the job is 30/05/2023. Does this mean that I need to submit my job application before 30 May comes around? Or Does this mean that I can submit my job application on the closing date, 30 May, and receive equal consideration as those who applied for the job days before the deadline?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jzbzxh4dct2b1.png?width=2158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c5bb081410b6b409133414a3410c8e9001c17108",

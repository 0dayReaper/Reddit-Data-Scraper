Since the UK admissions process is a lot more objective and heavily reliant on meeting all the score requirements\u2014sorry, law is a rather competitive course and your scores are a little weak. Though, are you taking any more APs this year? If so you might have a chance at receiving a conditional offer since they look at senior year scores too. But definitely look into other unis with lower entry requirements",

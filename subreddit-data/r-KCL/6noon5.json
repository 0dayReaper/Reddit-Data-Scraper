I know Kings is looked upon as prestigious because it's in London, but is it really that good? It doesn't score too highly in League Tables and lots of people online say it's not that great.",

Nowadays, people really seem to overlook its international status and the impact it has on your C.V. .. I've seen it with my own eyes.. if you're at the top of your class you get internships at Google/Tesla/Microsoft/Ubisoft ...\n\nIt's a pretty laid back university if you want to goof around aiming for a pass every year but then again.. \n\nGood luck for your exams and hope you get what you want.",

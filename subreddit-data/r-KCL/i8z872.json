    "postText": "Hello\n\nThis morning I achieved a grade better than my offer for my firm choice, KCL.\n\nHowever I did not submit the IELTS exam due to the exam centres being closed in Spain and they rejected me.\n\nI have seen people getting extensions for the IELTS in similar situations to myself. \n\nIf you did, please DM me a screenshot of KCL giving you an extension for the IELTS so that I can build a case to hopefully get my place back.\n\nI would greatly appreciate your help.",

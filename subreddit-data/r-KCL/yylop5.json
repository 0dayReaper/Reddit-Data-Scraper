    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am a student planning to study abroad at KCL Spring 2023 and was wondering if you guys had any tips for booking accomodation next week. I was told it will open at any day/time next week. Since I am in a different country, it might open in the middle of the night and I am worried I might miss it. Any suggestions/help you might be able to provide would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!",

You have to qualify for it by sending an application in and proving you meet the criteria (parents income is under the threshold etc) you could get it",

They respond very quickly too which is nice, my application was accepted just 3 days after I applied! My invitation to book my room is tomorrow, I will let you know how it goes and how many options I have with KAAS :)",

Since I'm from Brazil, it is too expensive to travel with all our things (such is the case for our computers). I'd like to know if there are any special prices offered for KCL students or other things only offered for KCL students. Perhaps, we could create a \"useful links\" post :)",

            "comment": "I think you can stay with your family in one of the residence halls of KCL at a decent rent price. I had stayed with my wife for one year in a double-bed studio at fully catered residence hall at Champion Hill. It was one of the great places to live in London. Just 15 minutes ride on a bus to the Strand and you are at the uni. Also the residence hall served hot breakfast and dinner in its huge canteen, had bunch of facilities for social life including own library. But they started renovations when we left. I don't know if they still have the same format now. Perhaps it has been converted to a dorm now. \n\nAlso, there are some concessions for students in using public transport. You can apply for a personalized Oyster card and pay less for bus and tube. You can also use gyms and pools at a reduced rate. I hope this helps. \n\nI am sure you will enjoy your time spent doing PhD at Informatics department of KCL. \n\nAnd yeah, say \"Hi\" to my supervisor Peter McBurney. He is the nicest professor in the entire faculty. I still miss him cracking jokes or telling funny stories about notoriously famous dudes from CS history.",

I'm still trying to find a place fo live with my wife.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for all the information! This will all be so helpful. And I'll be sure to check professor McBurney!",

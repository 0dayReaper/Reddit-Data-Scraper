I\u2019m currently in military service, but I\u2019m looking forward to opt for King\u2019s College London when I finish my service. I saw that there are requirements of Mathematics HL needed for Accounting &amp; Finance, but I never took Mathematics HL in IB, but I did take Mathematics SL accelerated. Is there still any chance for me to be accepted into the course?",

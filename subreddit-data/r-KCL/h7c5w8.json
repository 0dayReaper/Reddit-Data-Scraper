What's its reputation like?\n\nI'm thinking of accepting my offer for Msc. in Analytics, but it's kinda pricey so I was just thinking of taking up an offer back home(Netherlands) since its basically free for me,  unfortunately as an European that means I won't get to apply indefinite leave to remain.",

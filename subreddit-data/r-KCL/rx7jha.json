For instance I went through my IB and I\u2019m applying for econs bsc and their requirements for it are 35, with a 666 in HL, however I got 35 with a 765 in Hl, but the 7 being in econs. Will they still consider cases like mine for application? Thank you! I hope they do because kings is my first choice.",

    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm thinking about maybe studying abroad at King's College for Spring 2022 and have some questions.\n\n1. What's the course load like? Especially when it comes to business or marketing courses.\n2. What are the best housing options for KCL?\n3. How's the location? What are some fun areas to visit while I'm in England?\n\nI've never been to any European countries before and I'm just interested in learning more about this university and England in general.",

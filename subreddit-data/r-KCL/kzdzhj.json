I have found King\u2019s to be very good for employability with all of my applications taken to at least an interview. \n\nI also recently carried out an internship which was accessible only to KCL Comp Sci students; King\u2019s has a website called Careers Connect where companies can post job positions for only King\u2019s Students to apply to, it was on there.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this course if you\u2019re interested in computer science, even if you don\u2019t have experience in programming.",

(or just overall finish successfully) \n\nany advice is appreciated, thank u :)",

All the pathways have very similar workload. To be honest, if you want to pass you don't have to do much. To stay in KCL there will be two types of conditions you can get for your undergraduate acceptance, a B+ (lower condition), A (higher condition). If you want to study the Business Management BSc at KCL after your IFP then you need to pass the IFP with an A overall. It's definitely doable but you have to put the work in. Definitely not as much work as an undergrad program.",

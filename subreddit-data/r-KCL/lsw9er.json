However, I haven't received it from others like Imperial or Edinburgh. I know a friend who applied to Kings for the same course as you on the 25th of January and got his decision within 2 weeks, he didn't get accepted. I think they don't evaluate applications on a first come first serve basis, but I may be wrong. They should send your decision by the end of March.",

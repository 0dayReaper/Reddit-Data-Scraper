    "postText": "so basically, im a year 13 student and i just recieved my offer from Kings for general engineering but i am thinking to perhaps change to electrical engineering simply because it has more programming and i would like to perhaps go into tech after uni (maybe data science/cybersecurity/machine learning\u2026). I wanted to ask all of the electrical engineers at UCL,ICL/KCL/QMU\u2026 if you could give me a very quick summary of what the course is about, how much programming is there, are there a lot of pure electricity, circuits, networks kind of modules\u2026\n\nAlso, would you say its a very challenging course in comparison to other engineering degrees.\n\nThanks",

    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m an international student who applied to KCL for their Social Science course this September 2022. However, my application was unsuccessful and they offered RPS to me. I\u2019m in a bit of a dilemma because I would love to go to KCL but the course doesn\u2019t seem so interesting to me. \n\nI\u2019m seeking advice and want to know what RPS is like for those of you who have knowledge or are possibly studying it. I would also like to know if internal transfers are available. I would love to be able to talk to someone who is in a similar situation as I am or can give me advice as to what to do.",

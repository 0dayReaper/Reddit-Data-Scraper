            "comment": "I\u2019m doing Maths and Philosophy (currently on my Year Abroad which adds a year, so Third year out of four). I think maths at King\u2019s is a really good choice - the teaching standard of very good. All the lecturers I\u2019ve ever had are absolute sweethearts - good at explaining and clearly love their subject. There\u2019s three hours of lectures plus an hour of tutorial a week when it comes to contact hours but both lectures and TA have office hours and take appointments if you want more time. For the tutorials, there\u2019s a weekly assignment sheet, which isn\u2019t graded but you\u2019ll be given feedback when you turn it in. The fact that these weekly assignments are virtually optional is great when you don\u2019t want to worry about a deadline all the time. But, in the end, I\u2019d much rather have them be graded, as it would enforce studying regularly rather than cramming all semester into a week of revision. \n\nThe general atmosphere is very friendly and department staff and administrators are actually on top of everything. Compared to Philosophy department, they get back to you really fast and are waaay more helpful. \n\nThe biggest con for me is how exams are done: everything (with the exception of Calculus I) was assessed in May. So, by the time I\u2019m writing an exam, I\u2019ve forgotten quite a bit of what was in the module. There is an attempt to mitigate this by hosting one 2 hour revision lecture per module the week before the exams start but I would much rather have an exam session at the end of each semester, than 8 exams in May. This is compounded by the fact that the exam is usually the only thing for credit. In year one , 10-20% of your module grade are also three short class tests (really short 3-4 questions, 30min time limit). Still, most of your grade is riding on the exam. Then, almost all year 2 and 3 modules are 100% exam.",

    "postText": "I have an offer for PPE from King\u2019s College London and an offer for EPP (economics, psychology, and philosophy) from Warwick. I am really confused about which one to choose because of the differences in majors and also city versus campus life. I also have the concern that EPP is a new degree with no graduates yet so might have much less credibility and power than PPE. What do you guys think, which one should I pick?",

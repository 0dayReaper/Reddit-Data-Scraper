    "postText": "Hi everyone and congratulations to freshers! We are here to ask for your support for this campaign. \n\nOur goal is to ensure nothing like [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/KCL/comments/vpmi7v/kcls_counselling_service_and_student_conducts/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) will ever happen to another King's student again (this is the link to our previous post on what happened). King's Counseling service has been disappointing as always - they are not just unsupportive, but are as well harmful to students' mental health. \n\nPlease do check out our [petition](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfIZBMm7-So3a-dLbpjm-BigEKnhWVh_8szD1gspISAyfmxYA/viewform) and new campaign [Instagram account](https://instagram.com/dignitytokings?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=). We would really appreciate your support to make King's Counselling accessible, accountable, and most importantly, safe to all. \n\nSave the students. \n\nThank you.",

In which case they have all these things listed on the website.. from what I remember it\u2019ll run you c. \u00a3210 a ~~month~~ week for an en suite. At the low end, so you\u2019ll likely be looking at more. I do, however, **highly** reccommend getting an en suite. The cost is worth it. I am frugal to the nail but damn, nah. The stories I\u2019ve heard. \n\nWork out what campus you\u2019ll be on and get accommodation closer to that. \n\nIn terms of spending that\u2019s up to you. Work it out yourself as it\u2019s highly subjective. This stuff isn\u2019t too intense, especially for a future maths student. (;\n\nI jest, but seriously, a lot of this is either subjective or easily searchable on Google. The one thing I recommend, however, (bar the en suite) is to go for uni\u2019 accommodation at least for first year. Private is just a pain. Also consider travel. You might want to walk/cycle for free, bus &amp; Tube will cost, obviously. \n\nIn terms of budgeting, it\u2019s really easy to eat healthy and eat cheap. Honestly it\u2019s the junk and crappy food that\u2019s expensive. It takes time out of your day but you can meal prep (there\u2019s a sub for this I forget. Probably /r/MealPrepSunday off the top of my head) to limit it but honestly you need to eat well doing an intensive degree. Placebo effect or not, it does you well in the long run. My proudest moment at uni\u2019 was doing a full week\u2019s shop with \u00a332 - and \u00a317 of that was a bottle of whiskey. \n\nCan\u2019t say for a pure maths (I assume) undergrad\u2019 degree, but I\u2019m continuing doing an MSc and the maths side is taught very well at both under and postgraduate from my experience. \n\nEdit - month to week. What is time but a concept anyway. Tell *that* to your landlord.",

Finances are an important part of life, and if you constantly limit yourself and count every penny you spend, you will end up frustrated with your overall experience, limited in the people you are friends with, and even potentially unhealthy (if you end up eating a lot of the cheap and horrible Tesco meal deals for example, like I did in my first year). There are great unis in much cheaper cities, where you may end up having a much better life. \n\nHope this helps.",

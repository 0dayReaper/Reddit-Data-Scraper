    "postText": "Hi there,\n\nI am /u/Joker8765, parliamentary candidate for the Liberal Democrats in the Central London constituency on /r/MHOC.\n\n/r/MHOC is a simulation of the British Government and we are currently holding an election. The election is essentially us asking reddit users to vote for us on /r/MHOC. \n\nWe introduced Universal Basic Income, a policy which has meant that no one is left too poor in our society. We introduced the Digital Bill of Rights, to ensure that our privacy is respected and not violated and we abolished tuition fees, ensuring everyone is able to have a full education, not just those who can afford it.\n\nWe have a strong past record, and I ask you to help me continue it. We need you to vote for us so that we can continue doing the good work that we have been doing.\n\nPlease vote Liberal Democrat here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MHOC/comments/4zr812/general_election_vi_megathread/\n\nI also recommend you come join our party here if you're interested!\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MHOC/comments/4qf3gl/join_a_party/?sort=new\n\nAnd our manifesto can be found here:\n\nhttp://mhoclibdems.com/votelibdem2016\n\nThank you!\n\nThe mods of this sub can PM /r/MHOC to be added to a blacklist to prevent all further MHOC ads.",

    "postText": "hey! i\u2019m an international student looking forward to study in King\u2019s. I recently applied for PPE but was offered for Politics instead.  I do desire to study a more Economics related course (and to abide by my scholarship agreement back home)\n\nHence, I sent a message through King\u2019s Apply and an email to newstudents@kcl regarding my appeal to read Political Economy instead. It\u2019s been two weeks with no news, and I was wondering if the Admissions Team would ever reply to me. Anyone with similar experiences could share how they got through this process? Thanks man.",

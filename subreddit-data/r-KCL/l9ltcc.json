First of all, congratulations for getting in, it's a competitive program and a world class department! \n\nI graduated from this course a year and half ago now, and I'd very much advise on going for it too! \n\nHere is my take on the course: \n- Excellent research opportunities (thats probably the most important thing). I've spent all my summers working for professors, and had no difficulty in finding a job (and performing well) after I graduated.\n- Very good teaching in a *broad range* of subjects (you'll get to learn about loads of different things, and focus on what you like most towards your last year of study). \n- Challenging course but not so much that you will not have a life outside of classes. Trust me, that's a very important point! \n- Very good class and professors vibe overall. I can say that I've had a lot of fun along the way, and met great and high performing people (both students and professors). \n\nWith regards to your question, I guess you're looking at the rankings of Kings for engineering. It is true that Kings is badly ranked in engineering, but the ranking is just irrelevant in the case of this program. The Biomedical Engineering department has been very quickly growing in the last few years, and there are A LOT of EXTREMELY competent researchers who work there, and who will teach you, and whom you might work on internships/projects with. \n\nI recently got accepted for a masters at ETH Zurich in an AI related course, which shows that you can get to very good institutions after you get out of this program. Friends of mine who graduated from this course got into Imperial, UPenn and other very good unis as well for their masters. Several have landed jobs in very good companies as well. \n\nHappy to answer any other questions you'd have :)\n\"\"\"",

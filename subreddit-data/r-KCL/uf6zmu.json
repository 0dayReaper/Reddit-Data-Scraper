    "postText": "I received an offer from King's College London for General Engineering BEng recently and I was wondering if there was a chance for me to switch to another course: International Management. I know that switching to a course outside my current department is unlikely and that Management is already highly competitive at King's, but I just wanted to know the probability of me being able to change my course. Both, General Engineering and International Management, have similar IB entry requirements. I'd highly appreciate getting opinions on this.\n\nAlso, I haven't accepted King's offer yet. I received an offer to study Engineering BEng/MEng at the University of Edinburgh as well, so I am still considering my options.",

KCL allows students to change courses in the first 2 weeks in semester 1. Maybe you could change then? Or you could try sending a message to KCL regarding this through King's Apply.",

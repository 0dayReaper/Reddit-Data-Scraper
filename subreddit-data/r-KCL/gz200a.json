There is very little difference between the 4 major London unis overall, but especially at graduate level. \n\nThe teachers and professors in STEM will mainly be very accomplished researchers, and the university which they work at is mainly luck of the draw (in terms of where they could get funding). \n\nUCL, KCL, Imperial, and QMUL are very similar. I ended up switching from KCL mainly because after finishing my undergrad there I wanted a change of scenery, and I wanted to take a more research-oriented direction which UCL and Imperial offered (and my field is generally the \"specialty\" of both of those unis compared with KCL).\n\n \nThe time taken for a reply was also a factor, if KCL came back to me quickly with an offer I wouldn't have applied to UCL and Imperial.",

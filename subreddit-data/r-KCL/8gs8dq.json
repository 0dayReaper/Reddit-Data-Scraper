And could you share your opinion on the quality of this residence? One more thing... Any suggestions as to which are the best residences at King's? \nTHANKS",

Both reasonably priced and in a very good location. Although my main criticism for GDS is that the \u2018security\u2019 and general running of the place is overly tight in some areas and non existent in others. ",

I lived there for my first year and I had one of the worst rooms - right next to the entrance with the window overlooking a lamp.\n\nStill, the rooms are nice. Great for cheap accommodation.",

I thought Julian Markham (and around E&amp;C) was a bit more dangerous (had someone follow me in the evening), although it\u2019s changed since then with the new developments.\n\nI\u2019d also say GDS and Stamford Street are pretty good options, both walking distance from Strand/Waterloo/Bush House (GDS not so much).",

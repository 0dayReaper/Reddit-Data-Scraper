Recently, my family and I have been through a change in religion due to which my parents and I are not comfortable with me studying the course anymore. I really want to go to King\u2019s because it\u2019s one of my best options. What are my chances of getting course changed to a similar degree like politics, philosophy and economics? What can I do to increase my chances, if any?",

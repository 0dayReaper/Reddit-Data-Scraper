If it was a big tutorial, we might either have some physics and maths, or philosophy students in (depending on the class) but generally it's a really good idea to get to know your fellow Physics and Philosophy students as you're gonna be spending almost all of your classes with them, at least until you get to specific options in 3rd year where there might not be that many people taking a class. \n\nThe timetable for first year is basically 1/3 maths and math skills, 1/3 physics, and 1/3 philosophy in terms of class time. However you'll probably be spending your time approx 1/4 maths, 1/4 physics and 1/2 philosophy because of phils reading, and the crossover between physics and maths. \n\nHope this is helpful! Feel free to let me know if you have any more questions. ",

What is the cohort size for physics and philo students? \n\nWith regards to the modules, will there be lab sessions or research projects (for physics)? Are the philosophy mods only assessed in terms of essays? Will there be research projects? \n\nI've looked through the modules available in the programme details pdf and i've found that all the modules are either physics or philosophy related. Will it be possible to take economics or law modules for instance? Or does UK not have the elective system? \n\nSorry to bombard you with so many questions!

This is pretty much the only time you can do lab work in Physics and Philosophy, which for me was great as I hate labs! But if you really want to do lab work I'm not sure Physics and Philosophy is the best route. \n\nPhilosophy is generally assessed by essay, although some are also assessed by essay type exams. I also did Logic, which is assessed by a more typical exam based style due to the nature of the subject. \n\nThey're generally physics or philosophy based, although you should be able to take modules from outside, like law, language or others. I'm surprised that this wasn't mentioned in the programme details tbh. Still, I think it's basically one module per year that you can 'swap out'. \n\nHope that's helpful! ",

Labs isnt really my thing either haha i was just wondering because i realised the tuition fee that i am paying is the physics tuition fee and i assumed that was because of the additional lab costs but since that is not really the case... \n\nOhhh hm are there any modules that you would recommend swapping a mod out for? Or are there any modules that you feel is a must-take? There are so many mods that interest me, i dont know what to choose! \n\nYeap that's really helpful!! Thank you so much!! ",

There's not bundles of choice with Physics until later, but by then you'll already know what you like. \n\nWith Philosophy I think you get quite a few options first year. I'd recommend Logic over Methodology, as it's really useful down the line to understand the symbols and the way you build up logical sentences and arguments. Also the exam is pretty easy which always helps haha! \n\nMetaphysics is a pretty cool option in the first year. I think I chose that and modern philosophy which is alright, but you'd be pretty safe with anything. \n\nI think that's all the first year module options! \n",

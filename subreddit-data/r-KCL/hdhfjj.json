            "comment": "From when I did the research for my master's, a lot of the difference is in the courses. Each University has its own strengths that they play to and it's important to find the courses that you are interested in studying. In doing that you really have to go into the modules and what is covered in those modules to find the right course. \n\nApart from that, the ranking does distinguish the three universities, however in my field they had professors that were equally qualified and had expertise in their own areas. \n\nIn the end, what I could glean was that your networking matters more in the post study scenario as compared to the ranking of the University. Oxford would have a definite advantage in the name, but you could find a course with a specialisation in Kings and LSE that could make you more competitive.",

It has a student satisfaction of 58% so that worries me.\n\nObviously KCL's reputation is elite, but I'm not sure about its economics course. It doesnt even show up on the uni rankings for economics but maybe thats just because theres not enough data. \n\nAnyone doing BSc Econ at KCL, how has your experience been?",

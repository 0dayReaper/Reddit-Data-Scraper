There\u2019s a big sainsbury near by and \u201clittle Portugal\u201d is down the block with a few restaurants. There are also a few cafes nearby and around the station. I wasn\u2019t there at night, but it definitely felt safe during the day. It was two different tube lines to get to strand I believe, but it was super quick and easy anyway.",

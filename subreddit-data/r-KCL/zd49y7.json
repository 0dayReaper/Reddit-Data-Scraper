            "comment": "It depends on campus and what transport you are budgeting for. E.g I have friends who were on south campus and south Bermondsey and took the tube. It\u2019s not like other unis where you need to start looking now as the housing market refreshers v quickly so id say maybe around two months before you\u2019re looking to move in. My place for second year I found and moved in two weeks later. Good areas to live for strand tho: Borough, Vauxhall, nine elms, temple, st Pancras, kings cross, Hampstead",

    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI just got admitted into the Global Affairs MSc program and the International Affairs MA (Distant Learning) program. \n\nI suppose I was just wondering whether these two programs are looked at differently once it's all said and done.  Having checked the admittance rates, there doesn't seem to be a significant difference. Are the online programs easier to get into? And are they considered inferior?\n\nAny insights would be lovely!",

May I ask what degree grade you achieved or are predicted to achieve? I'm sorry I don't know anything about the courses you're interested in, but congratulations on being admitted! I'm happy for you.",

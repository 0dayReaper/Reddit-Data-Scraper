            "comment": "The guardian rankings are largely based on satisfaction so to be taken with a pinch of salt. If you look at career after 6 months you'll see some higher ranked universities have lower averages of employment 6 months post-graduation. \nIf you get offers from UCL and KCL, go to open days, speak to current students. At the end of the day they're both good universities.",

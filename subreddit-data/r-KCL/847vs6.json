    "postText": "Hi! I'm an undergrad offer holder from China and I've been wondering how King's lack of a central campus + dormitory affects the way its students mingle and socialize. I've read somewhere that it creates a somewhat frigid atmosphere where you can study without socializing at all - is this true?\n\nI'm quite nervous about going to London and having to make new friends all over again, so some insight on social life specifically at King's would definitely be appreciated.

Also when you go out a lot to the same place e.g. Guy\u2019s bar on Wednesdays you end up meeting the same people over and over and form relationships that way too.\n\nIt\u2019s not one of those places where \u201ceveryone knows everyone\u201d but you end up forming smaller communities e.g. course/halls.",

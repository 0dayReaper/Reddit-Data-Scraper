            "comment": "Hey, I lived there for first term this year before moving to GDS (to be closer to Guy's campus). Overall I'd say it's ok, kitchens are about the same size as GDS' and the common room (although tiny), is nicer and more modern than GDS'.\n\nAlso, the free gym access you get with SSA is to Waterloo gym which is nicer than GDS' gym which is a plus. \n\nLocation is better if you're a Strandie, and also much closer to the big places in London - think Covent Garden, Leicester Square (Chinatown), Soho etc. Closer to the fancier clubs in Mayfair but further from student favourites like Ministry of Sound and Guy's Bar (the Guy's Bar equivalent at Strand is pretty bad, no-one really goes). \n\nI will say that room sizes vary - if you manage to get a refurb-ed one those are lovely but I applied and didn't manage to get one. Bathrooms at SSA are awful, worse than GDS (the floor in mine was some weird material and really dark). One of my friends was assigned to a room where the window was 2 inches away from a mouldy cement wall so not much light. \n\nIn comparison all of GDS' rooms are basically the same, so you won't have some really bad rooms and some really good ones. \n\nWhen I was living there, all the under-18s were put in the same block if that's relevant as well.",

    "postText": "A recent survey by Cibyl found that over 75% of students felt lonely \u2018most\u2019 or \u2018all of the time\u2019\n\nAs a fresher, I also noticed the lack of a campus community and the difficulties uni students face in building meaningful relationships - this is especially true at London unis,\n\nEver feel like you having nothing to do on that idle Wednesday afternoon? Haven't found a friend group or want to meet new people but find it super awkward? I'm building a calendar webapp that let's you host and attend spontaneous meetups of 3-5 people (e.g. coffee chats, going to museum, trying out a restaurant) at your uni.\n\nImagine 15+ of these microevents every day that you can filter by interest/ location etc.\n\nIs this something you would use? If so, pls vote here so we can turn the idea into reality (only takes a minute): [https://competition.theethosnetwork.com/post/lkbMShoNaEAhPHjYt54W](https://competition.theethosnetwork.com/post/lkbMShoNaEAhPHjYt54W)\n\nCheck us out here: [micromeetup.com](http://micromeetup.com/).\n\nWould appreciate any feedback as well. Thanks!!",

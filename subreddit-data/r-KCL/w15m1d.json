However, I haven't yet got any reply from the school. \n\nDoes King's generally confirm places in the university so late? Did I forget to do something? I'm starting to get worried. I'd appreciate any help!!",

Some of my friends have had problems with other unis not receiving their grade so the best case is to contact the admissions team through the student portal. I would recommend you to do this ASAP because I contacted them as well regarding some issues I faced and they still haven\u2019t gotten back to me (it\u2019s been 9 days). I wouldn\u2019t bother emailing the general inquires because they\u2019ve told me to contact and wait for the admissions team and I\u2019ve been waiting so damn long. So best case is to send them a message asap! It wouldn\u2019t hurt to also attach ur grades as an attachment to speed up the process just in case they didn\u2019t receive it",

Sorry to bother but i'm in roughly the same situation, I sent all my grades to the head of admission's via king's apply and I have been waiting for an answer for almost 2 weeks now. I have sent a message to hopefuly get an update but still no response. Do you perhaps know how long it takes to register foreign oib students ? (i'm in France but I have english nationality ). Thank you in advance to any answer :)",

Actually they just told me a week ago that my status was being evaluated and then today they sent a mail saying I had to fill a form for U18 but other than that i've only gotten a whatsapp message saying they were flooded with applications and they couldn' t tell me when my application would be accepted. Sorry I couldn't help more best of luck to you tho !",

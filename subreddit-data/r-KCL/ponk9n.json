    "postText": "Okay, so after a pretty tough year, like the rest of the world, I need to defer some modules but I also failed one module from the first semester. One of these modules is worth 30 credits and is deferred for next year based on mitigating circumstances. This was the universities choice not mine and is important to mention as you will see in a bit.\n\nSo, All the modules I sat for the year have been passed aside from one. These leaves me with 205 credits with one of my 2 condoned fails used and 30 credits being deferred to next year. Now, the way I see this is I should be able to advance to third year complete the 30 credit module, and finish my degree. However the university is telling me that I need to resit the entire year for that one unit which I think is absurd and will push back a lot of the plans I have for my future (I want to get my PGCE and be out of England within the next two years). \n\nDo I have any standings with filing an appeal and getting to complete my deferred module with my last year. If the college allowed me to sit the module with the rest of the deferred classes I am certain I would have progressed onto year three. Has anyone appealed this before? What should I use for evidence? I've got a meeting with my personal tutor soon but I fear not soon enough and this is really stressing me.\n\nThanks in advance for any help",

It makes sense all those low student satisfaction ratings for kings with the way they treat their students and the general lack of support. Speak to KCLSU you might get a helpful person (I didn't) if you have the money I recommend alpha academic appeals (very pricy) you can definitely appeal I am too but its stressing me out that the appeal takes upto 30 days and classes start in less than 2 weeks. Btw really loooo into the university policy and guidelines and ask them why they deffered the exam to next year and not August.",

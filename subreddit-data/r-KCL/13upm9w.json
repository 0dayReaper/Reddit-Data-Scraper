It's just if you happen to know people and get on with your flatmates.\n\nFreshers week everyone talks to everyone in the common room, after that socialising is ad hoc. Two of my friends I met them through societies and my course, only to later find out that they're also at gds and I just never saw them.\n\nEdit: there's also regular events for socialising, but most people don't participate. It's always the same people who do",

But gds of all the accoms is one of the most insular I've heard. \n\nAngel lane social life is far better.\n\nBut tbh. The social life is what you make of it. You can have a social life anywhere, just make friends who want one. I could have gone crazy at gds, if I really wanted to socialise just there, but I made friends at other accoms and we mostly went out to student bars anyway.",

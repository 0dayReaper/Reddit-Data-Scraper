    "postText": "i was looking at the accommodations policies and noticed that the rules for overnight guests seem kind of strict (eg they have to be signed in before 2300 and can only stay up to three nights). i was wondering how strictly these policies are enforced as i'm planning to study abroad with my so in the fall and was hoping to be able to spend as much time as possible w them!\n\nedit: i don't know if this is of any relevance but i'm currently looking at great dover street, stamford street, and atlas for housing",

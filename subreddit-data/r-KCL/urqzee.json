            "comment": "If you mean Atlas, the accommodation in vauxhall, I haven't lived there but I've visited friends there and it is REALLY nice, it doesn't feel like student accommodation, it is in a new development skyscraper surrounded by other skyscrapers. Decent rooms, very nice kitchens and incredible common spaces from hangout to outdoor terrace. There are a couple cons, the first one is obviously the price, it is incredibly expensive, but if you can afford it then amazing. The other is perhaps the location. It is in general a safe and central area of London but it isn't in the \"kcl triangle\" where most people that live in kings live (Strand-London Bridge-Elephant and castle) while moon raker, SSA or even DC are right in the middle of the \"student life\" of king's. In addition, it's in a very new area that doesn't really feel a lot like traditional London. Full of modern buildings and even some pretty busy roads. If you're coming from Middle East/Asia/Africa/America it will probably feel quite at home whereas if you come from Europe or other more walkable cities it may feel a bit weird to be surrounded by such huge building. I recommend exploring the area on street view to get a better idea.",

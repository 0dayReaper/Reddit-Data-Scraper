I have tons of work experience such as internships, leadership roles in my school and 2 of my own Businesses for about 1-2 years now. My personal statement is heavily on my work experience and i recently was invited on a business network for an interview so i guess that counts as a publication?",

Also if your personal statement is good it might help you get in over someone else.\n\nBest of luck btw",

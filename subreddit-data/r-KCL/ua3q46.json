    "postText": "Hello, I need some advice. I got accepted to MSc programs at KCL for Clinical Neurodevelopmental Sciences and Early interventions in Psychosis. Both of these are extremely interesting to me and whichever I pick I intend to apply the knowledge to the forensics psychology field. Are there any correct students of these courses here who could advise me on which one might be better to pick? Is there one which maybe opens more doors in the future, or is better for finding a job right after graduating, or has a better placement, or teaches less theory and more practical info? I would love to hear someone's first-hand experiences with the degrees as it gives way more insight than just reading the course paige on King's website. Thank you so much for any advice you can give me!",

That\u2019s just my take on it!",

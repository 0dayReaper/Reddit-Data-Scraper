    "postText": "I applied for an MSc in Global Affairs on the 1st of March, and the application status still says processing. I reached out via King's Apply and the response I got was that the application was being assessed by an admissions tutor. However, I'm an international student, and affordable accommodations are running out, meanwhile I hold other offers that I've yet to accept since King's is my firm choice. Is anyone else in the same boat, or can someone share a similar timeline for application where the final decision was actually received, albeit late?",

Give it time, everyone, your applications are being looked at!!! Trust me on that",

We got 0 lab experience and very little practical knowledge. Other than that the professors are great but the marking scheme is sometimes weird. I would suggest that you network as much as possible and to find something that you like to focus on. In general I wasn't too satisfied with the level of the degree, it felt a lot like an online course, but that might as well not be the case with open universities once again!",

    "postText": "My husband and I will be moving to London at the start of September for my postgraduate study at KCL. I'm not sure what campuses l'Il be studying at specifically. Given my program though, I expect to be at Strand and Denmark Hill. I'm an international student, so l'm not exactly sure where I could get the most bang for my buck. We don't plan on renting in Central London given the cost. Ideally, I don't want my commute to be more than 40 minutes and our budget per month for rent is about \u00a31.6k. We only need a 1 bedroom and an on-site washer/dryer. You don't have to list specific flats here or anything! We'd just like to know where we should be looking to rent. Thanks. :)",

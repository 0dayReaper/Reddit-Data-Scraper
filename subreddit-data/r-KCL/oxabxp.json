    "postText": "Any CS students available to help me out? What sort of stuff did you write. If you mentioned books, could I hear the titles of them. If you wrote a program and mentioned it, could you briefly describe what it did. If you did any work experience, could you name the employer. If you wrote anything else, could you specify it. If your feeling extra helpful, please could you share your PS with me, (if this subreddit allows that), I wont copy or share, I'd just like some inspiration. Thanks.",

Remember ur ps is only 1 pg I think it was a 4-5 words. You need to highlight y u want to do this course(never start a ps with for as long as I can remember  since I was young...) talk about your qualifications how they support your interest in Cs maybe fo an online workshop / experience there's ones that are max a week even a few day and link it back to the CS course and what you learned. ALSO TALK ABOUT STUFF you do outside of academics but link it back to the soft skills you learned from them. You can talk about a large range of topics as long as you can say what lessons you learned from them. Don't cater your ps to a specific university (unless your only applying to that university) oh don't plagiarise they acc check and anything more than 10% is a straight flag",

            "comment": "King's accepted my Bsc and Msc application for computer science and I generally had a good success rate from most universities (excluding Oxbridge). My answer is pretty much similar to what the other person said.\n\nMake sure to check websites for sample personal statements - there's many and if you analyse the good, accepted ones, you would find that a lot of them show great concentration and interest in the subject they are applying for. If you are able to successfully convince them why you are interested in this course then you would normally stand a good chance. This is where your A-level grades would back you up; I am assuming it's still AAA and with the rise in demand, always aim higher if possible. Mine simply followed in the following structure: Intro, Interest in the field of computer science, My achievements (projects, exp, etc.), Why King's? (note: you can tailor to a specific university if you wish. For some reason, I did that to ensure I tell them exactly why them as opposed to another uni). Conclusion and thank them for their time.\n\nAlso, contrary to what the other person mentioned, I would say to tailor it to why king's. Mentioning why they are good and their standings in CS in UK and achievement stands out imo. But I leave that up to you given the page limit that you will be constrained under.",

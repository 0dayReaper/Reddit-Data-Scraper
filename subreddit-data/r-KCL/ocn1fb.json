            "comment": "I'm gonna start reading philosophy at KCL this September.\n\nAs far as I know, KCL's philosophy department is one of the biggest in the UK and has strength in (what you would call) analytic philosophy. The department itself states (on the course information) that it has particular strength in the philosophy of mind, philosophy of science, political philosophy and ancient philosophy.\n\nI have decided to study at King's because I am especially interested in philosophy of mind.\n\nIf you are interested in any of the above areas, I think King's is a great choice for you.\n\nIf you are NOT interested in what is known as analytic philosophy and all that goes with it (such as symbolic logic), I think King's is a bad choice for you.\n\nHaving said all that, by looking at their faculty members, the department seems to be able to cover almost all areas of philosophy.\n\nSo even if you are not yet familiar with philosophy and don't understand what I have been saying, and even if there is no one specific area of philosophy you would like to focus on in the future yet, I believe King's is a good place to start immersing yourself in philosophy.",

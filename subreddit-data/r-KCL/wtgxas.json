I would like to begin applying for jobs and would like to use my KCL email versus my undergrad/personal email.\n\nEDIT: just got my email today (just had to ask the question and then I get the email, right? haha). Thank you for everyone's comments and advice! :D ",

Everyone got IT accounts at different times (some months in advance and some not until the first week of classes). Don\u2019t panic that it hasn\u2019t arrived yet, but if you\u2019re worried there is no harm in sending an email just to alert them.",

            "comment": "Eh, it depends what you are looking for in an accommodation. The parties are kinda mid, the fire alarm goes off once a week at 2 in the morning, and there aren't any good common areas like in the other accoms. That being said, the flats themselves(particularly the refurbished ones) are quite nice, the gym is great, and the proximity to Waterloo and Strand campuses is amazing. \n\nYou aren't given any choice for which room you get, so its a complete gamble. Some people have a horrible view of a dumpster or a courtyard, while others (like myself) can see the Shard.\n\nI hope this was helpful.",

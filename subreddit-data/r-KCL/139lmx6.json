    "postText": "Hi all, \n\nI have an offer to study BA EuroPol but was wondering what the course change situation is like. I achieved AAA, but most of the courses im interested in changing to require A\\*AA. \n\nIs it the case that I will be automatically rejected considering I don't meet the grade requirements? Or are they more lenient to offer holders? \n\nAlso, I know this is completely far fetched, but hypothetically, if spaces were available for PPL, do you think i'd be able to request transfer ? (I know this is very unrealistic, but I wonder if anyone has perhaps experienced changing to a law related course)\n\nThank you very much",

It will show whoever runs your department you aren't committed. Only time I have heard transfers happening is within the same department and at the start of term.\n\nHave a look at your course and see your module selections for 2nd and third year. There are normally a lot of modules you can do from other departments.",

I'm just worried that it won't be as 'prestigious' as an IR degree from King's. Though, like I said - with EuroPol I can pick IR modules,econ(business),law etc - not forced to do IR theory.",

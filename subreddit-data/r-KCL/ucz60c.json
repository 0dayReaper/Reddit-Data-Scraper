    "postText": "the accommodation process is driving me insane as an international student. It\u2019s so unpredictable and complex. I\u2019ve been trying to get a room at stamford street apartments since Thursday last week and i keep stalking the website like a hawk and sometimes even wake up at 5am my time to check and see for updates. Since last week i haven\u2019t seen any more stamford street rooms be added or great diver street but some other accommodations keep getting updated. I can\u2019t be awake 24hrs and i don\u2019t know when the next batch of rooms will drop because they seem to go quickly. Does anyone understand this process really well or give me any helpful info please? I\u2019m really frustrated at this point \u2026.",

            "comment": "You'll just need patience and luck. They release batches randomly. And, even if you finally booked a room you want, they can change it anytime and allocate you another room without your consent anytime (of course before you move in), although they will notify you. Unless you have some specific requirements for accomodation, such as mobility issues, they probably won't give you back the room you wanted. It's very annoying and unfair.",

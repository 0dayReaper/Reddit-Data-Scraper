Just wondering how the course is and how the uni in general is.",

            "comment": "The course is generally good and covers enough for you to discover what interests you. There are also some good compsci related clubs and societies. \n\nIn 1st year, we covered things like ethics, logic, computer systems, Java programming, databases, data structures, and software engineering theory. \n\nIn 2nd year, you\u2019ll cover more maths/logic, AI, internet systems, more programming, OS and concurrency, and programming language formalisms, as well as some group projects. Keep in mind there are some options and these are only the ones I chose. For example, there are robotics modules too.\n\nIn third year it\u2019s a bit different. You have one solo project (dissertation) and a lot of different modules. The choice is huge so I can\u2019t list them all but you\u2019ll definitely find something you like",

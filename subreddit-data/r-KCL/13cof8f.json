E.g corner room\n\nQUESTIONS\n\n1. I know it varies for each residence but how do I read the room name? \\[EXAMPLE: G (floor) - (section of floor) (Alphabet indicating room)?  \n\n2. What's the room name format like for SSA and Orchard Lisle?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uxhye4ciusya1.png?width=654&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=53cae6a24e842868977864c55431adc0daed0f09\n\n3. Could anyone send a URL for / draw a floorplan map (not the map of the room itself), marking out where the courtyard is (for courtyard facing rooms) and the streets \n\nsample of what im hoping for:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aljqnzcyusya1.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b5c5eaabea109bebd787196828f44bf4598fe294",

Block 10 is beside the laundry room and across from the gym and was one of the first to get the automatic doors. I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019ve upgraded the rooms however",

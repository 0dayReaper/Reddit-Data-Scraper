We still need 50 undergraduate autistic students to help with my PhD research project.\n\nIf you are an undergraduate autistic student in the UK, do complete the confidential survey by visiting:\n\n[https://warwick.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_1Bzap0RyFKEZd3M](https://warwick.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1Bzap0RyFKEZd3M)\n\nAny responses I get will be much appreciated.\n\nThank you in advance!",

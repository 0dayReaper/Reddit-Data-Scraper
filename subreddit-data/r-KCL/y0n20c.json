    "postText": "Hi there,\n\nI am currently ironing out what graduate programs I am applying and am very intrigued by the MA in Big data at KCL. I was wondering if anyone has some experience in the program and how it is, also how competitive it is to get in. \n\nAdditionally, if anyone who has graduated from the program I would love to know what field you work in now!\n\nFor some context, I graduated my undergrad in Politics, philosophy, and economics (PPE)  with a concentration in politics. My interests are primarily in IR theory, as it is what I wrote my thesis on!",

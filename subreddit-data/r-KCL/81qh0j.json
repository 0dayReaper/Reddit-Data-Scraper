How much reading to do?\n\nI'm thinking of doing some reading before my course starts. Can you recommend me some of the core texts? I understand Face of Battle and On War are included\n\nI\u2019m also really interested to know, what do the first year modules (causes, conduct, experience, art, contemporary security issues) cover exactly?\nThanks in advance!",

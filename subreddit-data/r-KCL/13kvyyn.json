    "postText": "Hi I'm an international undergrad starting my first year at KCL this year. I'm trying to budget for transport and I was wondering \n\n1. what the cheapest way from Angel Lane to Strand campus is. I looked it up on google maps and there was a very wide range (4-7 pounds)\n2. how often do bus drivers go on strike\n3. how often do tube workers go on strike \n4. not budget related but what's KCL's (or law school's) policy if youre late for exams due to transport related strikes/ etc valid reason for being unable to reach campus via public transport\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "Cheapest is probably a bus each day it\u2019s about \u00a31.70 ish per journey so to strand and back will be \u00a33.40 a day. Buses will take about an hour+ though from Stratford to central London. There\u2019s also central line from Stratford station to Holborn then about a 5-10 min walk to campus this is I think now \u00a32.65 (I think give or take 10p) for a single journey inside zones 1-2 which is what angel lane and strand are in. So that\u2019s about \u00a35 a day for tube transport. This is also significantly quicker than taking a bus. What I personally do is use an Oyster card and buy a monthly zone 1-2 ticket, this comes out at a fixed \u00a3108 a month and gives you unlimited travel around zones 1-2 in London on either tube or bus. I would recommend doing this is you can as if you go in every day just for uni only then it works out a better deal per month, of course it\u2019s also likely you might want to travel more than to strand and back some days and this gives you a lot more freedom to do that without worrying about any extra travel costs. Hope this helps",

So makes sense to get a monthly.\n\nUnlimited travel in those zones, can do so much especially on weekends. Tons of free stuff to see and do in some 1 and 2.\n\nSo will make your life easier and happier",

It\u2019s 109/month which is expensive, but you have unlimited tubes and buses in zones 1 and 2. To the Strand campus don\u2019t bother with a bus, get the central line to Holborn and walk 10 minutes",

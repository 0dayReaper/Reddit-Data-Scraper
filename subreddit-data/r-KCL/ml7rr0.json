    "postText": "I received an offer from KCL sometime in January and I have to accept/decline my offer by the 30th of April. However, I am still waiting to hear back from UCL, I only applied in March so I knew it would be a close call anyway, but apparently UCL has been really slow in responding and some people have had to wait months. I was wondering if anyone has asked KCL for an extension before and if they allowed it? Or if anyone has any advice/suggestions/are in similar situations! Thank you!",

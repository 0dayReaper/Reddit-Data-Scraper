They'll probably be able to give you a tour of campus too.\n\nOtherwise probably best to email to enquire if you can get a tour. I know they do personal tours, because I've gotten emails to volunteer as a tour guide before",

You do need a tour guide to get you into most places as security is quite strict.\nThink this is how you also book for other campus sites also.\nIf all places are full might be worth emailing campus tours directly - email on booking link - as they may agree to squeeze you in but for group size/h&amp;s etc can only accommodate certain size. \nNB - when I went there were 2 teachers with 5 year 12/13 students. Most others were students on their own or with parents.",

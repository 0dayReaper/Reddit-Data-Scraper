KCL offered me A+AB and I ended up with A+ABB (later re-marked to A+A+AA). Using + instead of * because of formatting \n\nKCL gave me the place despite missing the offer, they didn't wait for the re-marking to come back. \n\nThis was for Biomedical science, so your course may be different. But I have heard lots of stories where people got the place despite narrowly missing their offer. I'm not sure how IB works, so I don't know if 35 is close to 40.",

It's been a month and IELTS hasn't sent me my TRF and King's says it needs that even though I gave them all the details and met the required scores. In India, IDP took over IELTS after I gave my paper so I got no registration ID as I gave my test with British Council and I am unable to get my TRF as it is uploaded online by IDP and it's support system is shit. Like, I got such horrible luck and after the embargo ends King's will probably say that I am late.",

I waited it out and just found out that I've been accepted. \n\nHope this helps and hope you got in",

I've contacted the Visa team to ask and waiting for their answer.\n\nHave anyone here been in the same situation? Is it possible for King to extend the deadline?",

Send a message on King\u2019s Apply with the (preferably exact!) date by when you should be able to send the documents to them and someone will get back to you what the last deadline extension is",

    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI am currently collecting data for my undergraduate dissertation. I am using a survey with questions on general awareness of methods of buying drugs. It takes 2-4 minutes to complete and it's all close-ended questions, and completely anonymous. \n\nIf you are a university student in London, it would really help my research if you fill it in. \n\n[https://forms.gle/aFx9ZiswDLqwxmjh8](https://forms.gle/aFx9ZiswDLqwxmjh8)\n\nThank you!",

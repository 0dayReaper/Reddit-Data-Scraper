    "postText": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m an International Undergraduate Admission Offer-Holder for BA International Relations. \n\nI received my CBSE board result yesterday and since I\u2019ve met my conditions I sent them in through the King\u2019s Apply using the option \u2018View and Send messages\u2019. I have also sent in my IELTS test score through the same (and added them in the English language requirement section as well).\n\nJust wanted to confirm whether that is the right way to go about things and if you\u2019d recommend I share my results and other certifications through some other channel.\n\nThank you so much!",

However, as King\u2019s is very busy and lacking in communication, they might take a while to respond. It\u2019s been about 2 weeks since I sent a message and I still haven\u2019t heard back",

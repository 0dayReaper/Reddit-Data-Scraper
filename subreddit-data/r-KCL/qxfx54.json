    "postText": "Hi,\n\nCan anyone tell me what the data science program is like? Do students work on projects for the modules as well or just the Individual Project for 60 credits? Also, what are the courses like - only technical knowledge or do they also teach how to manage DS projects?\n\nI am applying after 2 years in an Analytics jobs so just want to understand if students also develop the acumen to match tools/techniques with different business situation?\n\nAny help will be highly appreciated.\n\nThanks!",

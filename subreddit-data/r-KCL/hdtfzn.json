    "postText": "An American student studying Comparative Lit this coming fall. Hoping to get some advice on accommodation. Do you recommend finding housing outside of University accommodation (spare room or gumtree) or applying for uni accommodation?  Since I'll be moving on my own I'd like to find somewhere that will be relatively easy to make new friends and establish a social group. Not sure what direction to move forward in, also open to suggestions on places to look at (mainly been looking at Shoreditch), thanks!",

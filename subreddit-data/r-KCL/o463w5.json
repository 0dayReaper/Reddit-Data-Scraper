    "postText": "Hey everyone! Thanks for taking the time to read this post. I would like some advice on which school I should go for. I\u2019m an arts manager so I\u2019m applying to Goldsmiths\u2019 MA Arts Administration and Cultural Policy, as well as King\u2019s College London\u2019s MA Arts &amp; Cultural Management. There are some pros and cons to each (e.g, there\u2019s compulsory work placement for Goldsmiths - which i value - that is voluntary in KCL).\n \nI\u2019m not from the UK, so a lot of my research has solely been based on what I\u2019ve read online. If anyone has any advice on which course is better in terms of work opportunities, reputation etc - please let me know! \n\nThank you in advance x",

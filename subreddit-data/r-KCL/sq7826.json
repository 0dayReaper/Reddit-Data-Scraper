    "postText": "Hi there, over the past few days I have been struggling to register for accommodation. It states on the website that 48 hours after you have firmed KCL you can register for accommodation, and that you use your KCL ID as the username and then press reset password if you have never accessed the portal before. The only ID number I can find is my student number which I received in my offer letter, and after putting that in and following the steps nothing seems to be working. I have contacted KCL via the enquiry form and explained everything, yet they literally just sent me back the steps that are already on the website. Can anyone help me out with this? Have I been doing something wrong or have I got the wrong ID number? \n\nThanks!",

And yes I have put in my student number as the username and then once I press reset password it pops up with a message saying \u2018validating credentials\u2019 and then it disappears and nothing happens apart from it saying at the bottom that \u2018the username or password provided is incorrect\u2019. I also made sure several times that I have copied the number in right but it\u2019s just not been working :(",

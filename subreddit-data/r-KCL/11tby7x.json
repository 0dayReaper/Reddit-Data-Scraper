For a MSc it was 1 day at kings, 8 days for the PG dip same programme no references for either, anyway good luck. Sorry you didn\u2019t have the swiftness I did, don\u2019t want to make you jealous, but god I started out as an economics major at a meh college transferred to political science with a law concentration in America, I would\u2019ve love to have had PPE as an option. Hopefully we\u2019ll cross paths in strand. I\u2019ll be the ugly one btw",

    "postText": "The gist is in the title - but I'm an international student who just received an offer into a postgraduate taught program and as much as I would love to go to the program, the timing isn't right for me financially and because of new family circumstances. \n\nSomeone please help me talk through my options. Can I start in January instead of September? (Which isn't technically a deferral but I'm guessing that would mess with dissertation times?) Should I cut to the chase and decline the offer with the hopes of getting in next year? If I did this do you think King's would hold me declining the offer now against me in the future?\n\nThe third option is to just accept, and deal with the family aftermath and finances during my course but frankly I think that would destroy me. But it also feels like I could be saying no to a once in a lifetime opportunity. But then again since I got in so late I'm already past the scholarship deadline, Visa application, behind on looking for accommodations . . .\n\nI am so stressed. Please send help.",

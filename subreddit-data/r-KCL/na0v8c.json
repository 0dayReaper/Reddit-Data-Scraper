            "comment": "Lived in Atlas last year, the community side was pretty bad- almost never spoke to the other people in my hall but that might just be me. Both are right near the rail line but Atlas is a lot closer to some of the nicer parts of Vauxhall like the Pleasure Gardens, the park just across the street, the River and the central Vauxhall Station. Swathes of construction land kind of plague both but Atlas seems more on the edge of it. \n\nAtlas had a really nice interior having been built only a couple of years back but I can\u2019t speak for Vauxhall accommodation, never been inside. I think most people that have lived in one wouldn\u2019t have been inside the other though so it\u2019s hard to compare.",

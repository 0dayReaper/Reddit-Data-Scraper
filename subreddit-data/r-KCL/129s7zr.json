            "comment": "Currently in 1st year Phys Phil and I\u2019m enjoying it so far. \n\nDoing a joint physics and philosophy course is hard, a lot of my course mates including myself have considered dropping down to one or the other (usually considering dropping to only philosophy). For me the physics was either way too simple or way too difficult, but honestly as long as you are putting in enough effort you\u2019ll get through it and enjoy it. \n\nWe study an introduction into Quantum Mechanics and Relativity which not all unis offer in first year which is really good fun and interesting and you get a choice of 3 philosophy modules which are all really interesting. \n\nI\u2019d say the workload is similar to that of someone doing just physics as the three philosophy modules are taken instead of labs and another choice. We defo do get set more work than philosophy students but it\u2019s not that bad. \n\nThe people are all lovely in my year of the course, I\u2019d say there are less than 30 of us but I\u2019m not too sure.  No offence to the physicists but the phys phil students are the most chill in the cohort best vibes for sure \n\nI will also say that the level of teaching from the philosophy department seems better overall than the physics professors but there are only one or two physics professors that the majority of students have disliked (whereas most couldn\u2019t name a professor who they dislike in philosophy). \n\nSo basically it\u2019s really hard but fun if you put the work in. The philosophy is overall better but that doesn\u2019t mean the physics teaching is necessarily worse in every single aspect. If you\u2019re choosing between unis I would definitely recommend KCL, IMO London is a lot of fun compared to the other unis that offer it (york, Bristol, etc). Bristol is sick tho if you don\u2019t choose kcl choose Bristol.",

Or if that\u2019s even possible. I was hoping to transfer first year but I am willing to transfer second year to. I just wanted to know if you knew anyone in a slightly similar position \ud83d\ude22 \n\nAlso do you think the course will go on clearing? \nPlease any help would be much appreciated \u2665\ufe0f",

    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI'm interested in applying to study BA International Relations, however I achieved AAA vs A\\*AA (required for most King's courses).\n\nI contacted admissions about whether or not I would be automatically rejected - or if admissions would still consider me (only 1 grade off &amp; and achieved vs predicted), however they replied with some generic answer about \"holistic consideration\". \n\n**Does anyone know/ have experience with applying to or achieving grades slightly off requirements - what was the outcome ?**\n\nThank you",

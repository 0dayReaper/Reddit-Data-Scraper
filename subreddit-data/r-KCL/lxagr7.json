    "postText": "Hi all, \n\nI'm looking for a chance to increase my neuroscience knowledge and gain some experience with data collection and analysis, and this Applied Neuroscience MSc ([https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught-courses/applied-neuroscience-msc](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught-courses/applied-neuroscience-msc)) at Kings looks like a great fit on the surface. \n\nI'm wondering if anyone has experience with this programme or with the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN) in general. Is it worth it? Is there much \"live\" online communication? While I appreciate that it's online due to my current lifestyle, I can't help but wonder if I'd be better off waiting for an in-person experience that would be more worth the time/money. \n\nThanks in advance for your feedback. Cheers!",

I did find this video from a current student on Youtube, posted one day ago [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izKu\\_\\_yF-WY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izKu__yF-WY)\n\nAlso found the profile of this alumnus, seems quite inspiring. [https://www.flowresearchcollective.com/team-members/riandoris](https://www.flowresearchcollective.com/team-members/riandoris)\n\nHave you met up with an enrolment advisor yet? I plan on meeting one next week to ask a bunch of questions.\n\nBest of luck!",

                    "comment": "Hi!   \nI did speak with an enrollment advisor and I actually decided against it. Mainly because, if I'm being honest, the program seems to have a lot of \"fluff\"--in other words, courses that spend more time on theory and the \"state of the field\" more than actually practices. While this is useful in its own right, the thing that really finalized the decision for me is that there is no true research/statistics training from what I could see: you don't learn anova, or T-test, etc.   \n\n\nI've actually be involved with the Flow Research Collective in the past, and it's worth noting that Rian did the program AFTER he got the job with them, not before. So the degree didn't get him the job.   \n\n\nSo while I see value in the program and think it's probably quite good in some respects, it feels like a lot of money to not learn some of the key research skills that make a masters degree in such a field worth it in my opinion.",

It's certainly a great degree in terms of further education say for people in human resource management or coaching etc. \r  \nBut it simply lacks the statistical methods to be able to do a Phd afterwards, I don't think any university will really find that a sufficient foundation, probably not even KCL.",

I might go back to London at some point when Covid is more settled. \n\nHow are you going with your search? Did you find a suitable program?",

I can see there are lots of opportunities to engage in research at KCL. The teachers are very high quality, so are the students. There are doctors and psychologists in the program.....one of my fellow student is a neurologist....super impressed so far, but it's still early days for me. So far I'm quite happy!\n\nI'm interested in many aspects of neuroscience, especially those related to spirituality: Mindfulness, Yoga, Fasting etc. What about you?",

I found your comments pretty interesting since I haven't found much about student's experiences with the program.\n\nFor me, it looks like the perfect program since I am not looking to get \"molecular\" or super intensive research and more into the application....\n\nI am an M.D., with a life Coach certificate trying to look into giving my career a boost and increase my knowledge in transforming people's lives, organization and society through  the mind.\n\n\nI hope you can help me answer a few questions...\n\n- Do you have frequent communication with academics?\n\n- Do you feel you are being taken care of as a student?\n\n- What would be the best 2 things for you so far regarding the program?\n\n- What are 2 things you would say could improve?\n\nThank you very much In advance",

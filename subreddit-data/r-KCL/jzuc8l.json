    "postText": "Hey guys, kinda confused about the COVID situation in general- I have a good set up to remit learn at home, books and everything intact, seeing as the UK locks down and eases out- and the situation is constantly changing, I\u2019m wondering if I should listen to my parents and stay home for semester 2. This would save me a substantial amount of living costs (as an international student) and would mean, it\u2019s easier to rent a place in second year and have a more relaxed uni life. As a first year I\u2019m primarily worried about not making good friends and having lasting bonds with them, and just generally struggling with social life stuff if I do this whole year online. Please feel free to share if any of you have advice. I\u2019m very covid conscious and am pretty scared, I have health anxiety :/",

I am fully staying home for the entire year and don't intend to move to London. If I were you, I would honestly stay at home.\n\nSince you're just a first year, you'll have plenty of time next year to make friends and enjoy the London life. Have you tried joining societies? You can meet a lot of people on there.",

However, Guy's campus generally seems like a close-knit bunch of students studying very similar subjects so I was just wondering whether you are likely to come across some familiar faces and whether the social scene is decent.",

By the end of the degree everyone kind of knows everyone, even though there are 600-odd people in the year group",

There are SU branches on every campus, but the main SU building is on the Strand. \n\nIf you're talking about student union bars, then Guy's Bar is probably the most popular (debatable, but even Strand students go there). It's for sure the most social, but as a bar it's quite clique-y, so I wouldn't recommend going there alone on a sports night, unless you're incredibly extroverted. If you go alone, go to event nights organised by societies, those are very good for meeting people in your interest group.\n\nAlso - Guy's people look down on every other campus. As a Guy's graduate, this is justified because we are definitely superior to the other campuses ;)",

Don't plan for that too much right now, focus on where you'll live and admin stuff. \n\nYou can try to find some groups on facebook if you want",

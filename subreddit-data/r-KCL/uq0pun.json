    "postText": "hi everyone! i've received an offer at king's beginning sept 2022 and have just recently firmed my decision to do so. i read that students are advised to begin the booking process prior to the 27th of May to qualify for the accommodation guarantee, but i've been trying to login to the main landing page with my KCL ID (the one on my offer letter) but i've been unable to do so (even with the 'reset password' option as it didn't send any emails to me with a temporary password). has anyone had similar experiences to this, and if so, what did you do? thank you so much!",

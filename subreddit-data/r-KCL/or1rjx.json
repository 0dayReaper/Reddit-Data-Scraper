    "postText": "Hey there! I have a conditional offer for law and my requirements are with the American exams like APs. Results day was a few days ago and I\u2019ve fortunately managed to meet my conditions. I sent my scores to KCL using the college board service and I\u2019m just waiting for everything to be processed. \nHas anyone gone through this yet? Has any AP test taker received their unconditional offer? If yes, how long did college board take to send your score reports? \n\nThank you!",

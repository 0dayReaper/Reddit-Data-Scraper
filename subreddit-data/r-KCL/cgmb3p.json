    "postText": "Hello! I am a 24F from Chile (South America) and Im thinking on studying an MA abroad in Europe. I have a bachelors degree in History and Education and for the past year Ive been teaching in a high school.\nI am interested in studying something related with communication and digital media. I love to know how different subcultures or Music genres have created cultural movements and I love to write creative reflections. \nI would like to know if anyone can please talk to me about different MAs in KCL where I can learn about digital communication and also a little bit of sociology? Is the Digital Culture &amp; Society MA what I imagine? Would it help with what I am looking for?\nBy the way, english would not be a problem.\n\nPlease, need some advice! Thank you!",

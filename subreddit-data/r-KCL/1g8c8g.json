    "postText": "Hi guys, Im currently planning to do a masters in neuroscience at kings in the upcoming academic year. If anyone is currently on this course, or have completed it in the past, I would love to hear what you guys think about the university and the course. Im also in the process of applying right now, and I'm just finishing of the personal statement at the moment. So if you guys have any tips on anything particular that I should include, I would really appreciate it.\n",

            "comment": "Which course? There's a few. I'm working at the MRCCDN at the moment and know a few mscs.\n\nOverall the department I'm in is pretty awesome. Everyone is relaxed and really collaborative (a relatively rare thing and bot necessarily replicated at the IOP). And the research is world class. That said as an msc student you'd be lucky to get much data. Most people need more than a few months.\n\nYour application should focus on research (if that's what you want to do). Mention possible topics as well as what you may have already done yourself. You don't have to mention supervisors or specific fields, some people prefer students to have a variety of interests. But try to show your interest through suggestions. Going on about how you love neuro and how awesome it is and how you've wanted to be a neuroscientist since you were a fetus won't get you very far. Mentioning interesting papers and ideas for future projects shows that you are serious. And don't be worried about asking something stupid. Sure check it over first, but you're new to the field and science is about answering questions no matter how stupid. The guys who go over applications should appreciate that.\n\nIf you want to get onto a phd after then you'll need a merit so work for it!\n\nEdit: if you haven't already, check out /r/neuro and /r/neuroscience. They usually post some of the interesting stuff that's happening at the moment.",

                    "comment": "Thank you very much, that was really helpful, and I actually frequent those subs quite a lot.\n\nI am applying for the actual MSc Neuroscience. The reason I am doing this, is because Im coming in a from a pharmaceutical science background, and I felt that I am missing key knowledge, despite having neuropharmacology as a core module in my final year, and doing my final year project in this topic. I felt that this masters would give me that missing info since it covers quite a broad range of topics, from what I saw in the modules they listed on their site. This also would help me to make the right decisions when it comes to applying for phds. Maybe I should put down these thoughts in the personal statement as well, when it comes to explaining what I aim to get out of this masters. \n\nIn regards to the personal statement, you have just confirmed for me that I was kind of going down the right path. So now I can enhance it a bit more, to work towards the direction you pointed me to. Im coming to this masters with a first in my degree, and I aim to achieve the same here so I can be more successful in the phd application process, which I want to do at kings as well. So thanks again.\n",

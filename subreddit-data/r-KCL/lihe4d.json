I stayed at Dover street and it was ok, it had its own en-suite and the shared kitchen was great.\n\nLook up KCL accommodation and don\u2019t click the ad.",

King\u2019s policy allowed refunds, which I received.\n\nOther than that not entirely sure about private agency residences; maybe call King\u2019s accommodation?",

            "comment": "hi, im finishing up this MSc now, depending on which \"pathway\" you take you will have two core classes per week (intro to stats and basic mental health), and then two optional modules, so 4 classes per week, for us they were spread on Tuesdays and Thursdays (10-11 am tuesday/thursday and 12-1 Tuesdays, 1-3 Thursdays) \n\nI recommend doing the key readings as you go along because nearing exam period makes it stressful to have to go back and do everything from the beginning. \n\nif you have any other questions about the course feel free to ask and ill reply to this thread :)",

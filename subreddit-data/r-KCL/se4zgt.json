Another great module I did was Operating Systems and concurrency which was good. The lecturer was amazing. She made sure that all her students were helped whenever she could. The content was really interesting too. I loved learning about how OS manages hardware. I'm not sure if its still being taught but I also did the Robotic Group Project. I did mine during lockdown tho so it was a bit limited but I really enjoyed designing the hardware and writing the software for the robot through ROS and a simulation software we used.",

I want to take AI but I also saw this and I'm not sure who will teach it in the Fall: [https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2663375](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2663375). (i'm planning to study abroad at KCL). I already took OS, unfortunately, but the lecturer sounds great.",

So all in all I would say it was good.",

I found it a lot harder than my friends at other unis and other London unis to make friends. But perhaps what stuck out most of all is I have never really felt welcome or good enough at KCL. I later went to a different uni (which I wont name sorry) and had a more positive experience.",

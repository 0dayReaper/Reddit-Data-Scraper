    "postText": "Howdy Folks, \n\nI hope you are having a good time and studying diligently!! I wish I could get some guidance/answers here on some concerns. I intend to apply for the KCL MRes/PhD In Healthcare Technologies pogramme next year and sincerely hope to get accepted into the upcoming cohort. However, I would like to check here to see if you might shed some light on my profile: \n\n1. In France, earned a distinction undergraduate degree in computer science with a 3.53/4 GPA. \n2. Awarded a master's degree with distinction from the University of Kent in the United Kingdom. \n3. I have completed several research projects at university that resulted in solutions being used in clinical settings, and as a result of my master's thesis's promising results, I am currently conducting research all year on two machine learning models that will be used in a national live audit with the United Kingdom's NHS. \n4. I am pursuing a master's degree in computer science in Paris to spend the year, where I am also employed as a data (science/engineering) intern. \n5. Finally, I am on track to co-author two medical-AI publications this year, in collaboration with the medical unit with which I am conducting research and for which I will hopefully been awarded two funding too. Additionally, I was awarded a competitive private scholarship in France last year. \n\nThat summarises broadly my profile's success today, and I was wondering if you had any clue what my chances are of being chosen for the next batch; I am so stressed... yet so motivated! \u2705 \n\nI would be quite happy if you could tell me what about you and your profile if you have been accepted into the programme or any similar  \ud83d\udd2c  \n\n\nEveryone, cheers!",

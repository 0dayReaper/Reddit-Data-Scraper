The phone lines are closed since everyone is working from home. \nYou can fill in an enquiry form if you want. \n\nhttps://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/international/meet-the-team",

Equally, with the UCAS deadline being extended to the 29th of Jan, it is likely, that applicants would start to hear from Feb 2021. Plus if your course is competitive that is likely to case. Hope that helps.",

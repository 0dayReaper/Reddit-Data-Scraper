I am offered a place at KCL Law school and am looking for most suitable residence. \nMy accommodation portal shows only 3-4 options that do not include my preferences (atlas, Stamford etc). \nPlease help out! Have spaces run out or how do i book accommodation closer to my campus??",

            "comment": "Hi! I'm a first year and live at SSA - places have not run out, but what happens is that places for residency change every day if that makes sense? So say you check one day you may find places for Atlas, then the next day there are no places for Atlas but there are for Moonraker etc. This is just so everyone has the opportunity to try and get their preferred place of accommodation. \n\nYou are allowed to change your accommodation choice once, so what a lot of people do is pick whatever is offered and then wait for their preferred place to appear and swap to that, just so they have a place to fall back on if they end up not being able to get the accommodation they want, or get accom at all. For example, I picked Great Dover Street even though that wasn't my preferred place of residency, and checked every day to see if they had released spaces for SSA, so don't stress - I hope you get the accommodation you want :)",

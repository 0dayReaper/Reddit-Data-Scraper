    "postText": "Hi, I'm interested in applying for for Advanced Computing MSc at KCL, but I'm currently trying to decide whether I should commute or rent in London.\n\nIdeally I would commute because of the extortionate rent prices in central London, however, if I am required in-person 5 days a week I think I would favour living nearby.\n\nWith this in mind, does anyone know what a typical timetable for this course would look like? How many days a week, or hours a day, would I expect to be required on-site/in-person?\n\nMany thanks!",

They drop rooms in dribs and drabs so that it's fair on everyone, rather than all of the good rooms going before the majority even have access. But, if you're getting nervous, they allow one change of booking (if they haven't altered the rules) so you can book something now and swap it to a different room later on. Just don't book something you can't afford in case you don't end up swapping.",

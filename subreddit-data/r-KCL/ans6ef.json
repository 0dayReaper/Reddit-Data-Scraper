            "comment": "hi! i'm going to be a first year next year too - so not too sure how useful my advice would be but:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**useful links;**\n\n* the main kcl website for looking at accommodation + virtual tours, fees etc is obviously  [https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/accommodation/residences/explore-residences](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/accommodation/residences/explore-residences) \n* and this  [https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/assets/PDF/accommodation/2016-17-docs/201617-Residences-brochure.pdf](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/assets/PDF/accommodation/2016-17-docs/201617-Residences-brochure.pdf)  basically shows you a little bit of information about each accommodation (prices are out of date though) + distance to campus\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nclosest to strand campus is probably stamford st apartments (about a 10 min walk from strand - it's where i'm hopefully going to be able to stay), though great dover st is pretty close by to. ensuite prices are around \u00a3204 a week i think so a bit pricey but not the worst\n\ni'm going to be based on guy's campus the most, but i wanted to pick SSA just because i thought i'd be able to meet a wider variety of students (given i'll be surrounded by dental ones whilst i'm on my course) and also i love the fact it's right across the street from waterloo campus + 24/7 library (i have issues revising in my room)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nnicer apartments which look nice are either super duper expensive (think moonraker point sth like \u00a3300 plus a week - which if u can afford then consider me jealous) or relatively far out - eg. in stratford with \\~20-30 min tube journey to campus, so if you don't mind the commute + increased transport costs then i'd say angel lane and champion hill are super pretty!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nif you're on a budget, then wolfson house is (i think) the least expensive hall, though rooms are a bit grotty and you don't get an ensuite, but friends of mine at king's have told me it's really really social so i guess that makes up for it\n\n\\+ you can also apply for KAAS which basically gives discounted rents for students on lower incomes if budget is a priority for you as well\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsorry for the long post - hope that was helpful!",

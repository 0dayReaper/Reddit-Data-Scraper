If the applications are still open you can still apply if it\u2019s what you want to do. \n\nDoes kings even care about the GRE anymore? I\u2019m currently doing a MSc at UCL kings next year and my mate is doing DS and machine learning and he didn\u2019t do his GRE. We hung out with another DS student and I didn\u2019t ask about the GRE or anything just complained about our term 1.",

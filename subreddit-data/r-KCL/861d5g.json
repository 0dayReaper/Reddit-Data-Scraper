I've also been accepted to the university of Toronto (where I live) for the same program.\n\nI'm trying to get advice on which one makes more sense to go to, as well as help with wether kings has a good compsci program...\n\nOverall I'm just confused and stuck on deciding which ones worth the money, which is more fun and social... etc.\n\nANY replies would be great, thanks!",

            "comment": "I believe you should also consider student life and education system. Student life in KCL can be very different from what you'd expect coming from Canada, people just come to class and leave. There is not necessarily a \"school spirit\" and many students find themselves lost for the first year or so. Also, there are no exams, no homework, no quizzes... I mean, the entire grade of your classes will be based mostly on the final exam. It can be hard to get used to if you come from other types of educational systems. \nIf I were you, I would research more about these two aspects of university life, since both schools are very good in academics... and if you do not mind me saying, I would stay in Canada. London can be hard, it is very expensive, and very different from what you'll get staying in Toronto. \n",

You get one big final exam per course (some will also have a midterm, but its weight on the final exam is like only 10%). A final exam could weight from 85% to 100%, participation for instance does not tend to count towards your final grade. \nAgain, you get about one exam per course. Not one for the entire degree. ",

If you have applied for funding, send a message on King\u2019s apply asking for an extension to your acceptance deadline, sending your proof of application for the scholarship and the date by which you should hear back. \n\nAccommodation-wise, don\u2019t think it\u2019s guaranteed - you will have to find it/apply yourself\u2026",

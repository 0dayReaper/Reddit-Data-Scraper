I can atleast tell you it\u2019s easier to choose than UCL which is where I\u2019m currently going for a MSc. \n\nI\u2019m considering a cheap room in Wolfson or the studio for post grad that\u2019s about \u00a3305 a week. That\u2019s \u00a3200 more a month than my tiny en suite for a studio, in a better area. \n\nWolfson is slightly more than UCL\u2019s cheap non en-suite and appears so much nicer, but Camden is nice to live in, I liked it. There\u2019s an accommodation all the way in Islington, I\u2019d avoid it so no reason to wanna live over there going to kings.",

I\u2019m currently at Oxford where you live in college, so this is all quite new to me.\n\nI am looking for somewhere affordable and hopefully with a decent social life. I don\u2019t particularly mind if it\u2019s a bit shit, I\u2019m currently living in an attic with mice haha.\n\nAlso, the portal doesn\u2019t seem to be working!\n\nLet me know if you have any advice, also it would be fab to chat to some other incoming postgrads, if anyone is interested in a group chat also let me know!",

            "comment": "lol I can relate to where you\u2019re coming from then somehow being on the floor at UCL cheap accommodation for my MSc where there wasn\u2019t mice. That place has gone up to \u00a3145 from \u00a3130 a week it seems comparable to wolfson house but wolfson house seems nicer. I\u2019ve been recommended now living in Islington to move south, but that part of Camden was pretty nice and I felt safe, not so safe here. I can\u2019t speak on what it feels like around king\u2019s accommodations atm. There\u2019s one even more north east of me and I wouldn\u2019t even consider for kings. I\u2019m looking at wolfson house or the place that\u2019s a studio for \u00a3300 a week. My 2nd year of my 2nd MSc may have me employees under a contract making a salary and hopefully some assistance plus so maybe go wolfson first year. I liked the people at my first accommodation at ucl, but it was a shithole. Great social life",

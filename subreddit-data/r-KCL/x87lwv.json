    "postText": "Hi guys!!\n\nI have conducted a survey on teaching staff (i.e., teachers, TAs, SENCOs, senior and middle leaders) beliefs and knowledge of motor skills in autistic children aged 7 to 11 years old to enable our understanding of motor skills in the school setting. We will also gather survey responses from other schools in London, Northwest England, and Wales. We are extremely keen to benefit from the accrued experience and expertise of teaching staffs working everyday with autistic children.\n\nHere is the survey link: [https://uclioe.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_1yQowKHHCs5qRue](https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fuclioe.eu.qualtrics.com%2Fjfe%2Fform%2FSV_1yQowKHHCs5qRue&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cp.yang.17%40ucl.ac.uk%7C41a7e22bea2a4fd0227708da7abb9d75%7C1faf88fea9984c5b93c9210a11d9a5c2%7C0%7C0%7C637957243464787041%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=C9naTw6HTbCReTaBEYBub7GeKNv4HOEJNS4IYiIlM30%3D&amp;reserved=0)\n\nCould you fill in the survey and forward to other fellow teaching staffs? Thank you for your input and feel free to contact me anytime if you have any questions! Happy to do yours in return, just leave a chat to me!",

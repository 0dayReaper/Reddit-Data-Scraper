    "postText": "Hello, I'm an international student who has applied to KCL for MSc in Organizational Psychiatry and Psychology. I applied mid February but due some portal error (according to the admissions dept) my application date is showing as 06/03/23. I was wondering what the typical time is for KCL to respond with a decision? And how do you know if the if the admissions dept is assessing your application? Does the document status on the portal change? \n\nAny help is much appreciated. Thank you!",

            "comment": "Hi! Response times vary greatly from course to course - assessments are done split in two different stages (the \u2018admin\u2019 bit done by central Admissions) and then the course\u2019s Academic Tutor makes the assessment. If the courses start filling up, you may end up on hold. My recommendation would be: if you don\u2019t see any document status change nor any messages for 60 days since the application submission, I would query it - but do keep in mind that absessively sending messages won\u2019t do anything, applications get assessed every day so everyone will get looked at when their time comes",

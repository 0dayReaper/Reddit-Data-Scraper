I'm not sure if anyone I know missed their required marks and were accepted, but 90% of those who miss by only one grade end up getting in anyway. \n\nFirst year was AMAZING. It was packed with events and opportunities and meeting new people. If you want, check out my blog: http://blogs.kcl.ac.uk/fares. \n\nWhat subject are you applying for? Maybe I can get you in touch with a student there?",

                                                    "comment": "In first year computer science there are three main modules dealing with  programming (This is just plain CS, no management or anything).\n\n* Programming Practice (PRP) - an introduction to programming using Java. Covers the basics of object orientated programming. A good introduction, starts off a bit slow, but the lecturers are quite imaginative and put in harders tasks for more advanced students.\n* Practical Experiences of Programming (PEP) - Further use of programming. Introduces the use of Prolog for logic programming (some people love it, some hate it :) ).\n* Programming Applications (PRA) - as the title says, GUI programming. Advances on PRP by introducting students to designing and implementing GUIs. As with PRP there are some interresting problems for students to do. There exists 2 programming courseworks for this module.\n\nThere has also been an programming competition this year run by the lecturers of the above courses. I can't give much info on it as I've only heard of it in passing, but aparently it went quite well.\n\nOther:\n\n* Computer Systems 1 (CS1) - First year, has a little bit of programming with assembly (very little). Lecturer might expand this for next year.\n* Operating Systems and Concurrency (OSC) - Second year, iirc this has some C programming\n* Computational Models (COM) - Third year, haskell, quite nice if you can get the hang of it.\n\nThere is also a second year group project, and a third year individual project. Both require programming. The second year project has changed since I did it, so I can't comment on what it involves (mine was a roomba robot in playerstage), but the third year project is very varied. Some people developed smart phone applications, others for arduinos, or things written in Java. ",

                    "comment": "It's not too bad in terms of assignments - in first year you get two courseworks which involve building a piece of software that will line up skill-wise with what you're currently doing in your programming modules. When I was in first year we also had a 1000 word essay for our AI module which was easy and not even a huge chunk of the module if you're not an essay fan. It might have changed since then though! You have several weeks for each of these projects. \n\nSecond year you have three group projects: first semester is a small programming assignment for a few weeks then a small management assignment for a few weeks, then in the second semester after Christmas they're combined and you complete a project from start to finish with documentation and code etc, then you present it as a group. \n\nI haven't started third year yet so don't quote me on what follows: third year contains your big individual project which spans the whole year. You get to pick the project as long as you either pick from a list of projects suggested by tutors or propose one to a tutor who is willing to back and support you throughout it. \n\nThere are tutorials every week pretty much but no punishments for not turning up. Certain modules throughout all years will have optional coursework questions that don't count towards your grade but are useful to do! \n\nIt's really not an assignment-heavy course at all, I know people who have been to one lecture all year and still made it through with good grades (DO NOT DO THIS) but it all depends on how much effort you want to put into it. If you do the tutorials every week and the extra coursework questions and really put in the work (which still isn't that much, think like 2 pages of questions a week) your revision will be so much less stressful than everyone else's, trust me.

    "postText": "Hi r/KCL!\n\nI  hope you're all hanging in there in these trying times. My name is   Marie and I'm a Trainee Counselling Psychologist and doctoral researcher   at City, University of London. I'm looking for participants for a research project exploring different substance use patterns and how people make sense of their use. Participation would involve an informal  briefing followed by a 90-120 minute online focus group  discussion. We are specifically looking for UK residents aged 25 and above who fall into one of the below categories:\n\n\\- using alcohol recreationally (one alcoholic beverage/month is enough to be eligible)\n\n\\- using other substances recreationally\n\n\\- using alcohol/drugs in a way they feel might be a problem\n\n\\- recovered from substance use problem/addiction\u00a0\n\nPlease see below for more information and get in touch if  you're  interested in participating. I look forward to hearing from you  :)\n\n*This advert has been approved by the moderators.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c2c2ho8xv4x61.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=40bcc889d88616e75829b76cfdc934d7640d6269",

I don't really have any aspirations to go into banking or similar fields. I've visited both on open days, but I have to make my final decision by 6 May because that's the UCAS deadline so I don't have time to get tours organised. Thanks for your advice!",

            "comment": "Hey, KCL Physics and Philosophy student here! I spend approximately half of my time in the philosophy department of the strand building, and hopefully I can give you a bit of an insiders perspective. \nThe location of the strand building is amazing, literally in the centre of London. The teaching is truly excellent, and you'll get a world class degree at either location. Apart from that... There's not much I can say. Kings is great for a certain type of person; the sort of person who likes to come in, get their work done, socialise to a minimum, go home. Sure, there are societies (and to be honest, the philosophy society is probably one of the best societies in KCL) but the campus spirit you see at other unis simply isn't there -  it's more like a school. \nIf you want to get a great degree, and that's it, then KCL will work great for you. I'm not sure about UCL, and it might be the same story there considering its also not a traditional campus university, but that's my experience with King's anyway. The only thing I'd add is that later in your degree you can actually take modules from UCL, and other university of London colleges, and I'm assuming it works the other way round too. \nDefinite visit both if you can, and get a tour, just to get a feel what's better for you. Make sure you get them to show you the philosophy bar... Proud to be the only department in King's to have its own bar! \nHope this helps. ",

I want to be in London and I think that more than makes up for what is lost in terms of 'campus spirit'. I've visited both on open days and it hasn't really helped to make my decision. \nHonestly, the decision is so difficult, the bar might just swing it.",

UCL might have a cheap SU, but their sports night will bend your wallet over and have it's merry way with your student loans.\n\nKings has a cheap SU bar at Waterfront with great river views, an even cheaper and far superior one at Guy's (despite being in a dingy windowless basement), a slightly pricier/classy bar somewhere else on Guy's campus, and the philosophy bar.",

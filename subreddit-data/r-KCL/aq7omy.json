    "postText": "I'm in several undergraduate classes that take attendance at lectures but don't have a participation grade built in the class. I've missed several lectures under the impression that it would not impact my grade, but received an email form the professor saying that I haven't been to class and I need to start going. I'm missing a couple more classes later on due to travel plans, and was wondering if there is any threshold for how many classes you can miss or if there is a possibility of failing a class due to not attending lecture even though it's not included in the grade. Any advice is appreciated, thanks!",

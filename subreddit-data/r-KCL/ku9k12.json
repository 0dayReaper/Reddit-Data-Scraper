    "postText": "Hey, I'm an undergrad student in India, and I'll be completing my degree in a few months. I saw that KCL offers an online graduate degree called \"The Psychology and Neuroscience of Mental Health\", and I was wondering if applying would be worth it (as the pandemic has put an end to my plans of going abroad to study this year).\n\n I know King's IOPPN is excellent, and well respected in the research field, but would an online degree (if I do manage to get into the course) hamper my chances of getting into a research master programme in the future? I know there's a large practical aspect to psychology, so that's why I was wondering. If there's anyone here who is in the programme or has completed it, please let me know how it's going for you!\n\nThanks in advance \ud83d\ude0a",

Currently these are the only subjects that are taught in person.\n\nMedicine and Dentistry\nSubjects allied to medicine/health\nnursing (all branches), midwifery\ndietitians, occupational therapists, operating department practitioners, orthoptists, paramedics, physiotherapists, prosthetists and orthotists, radiographers and pharmacy\ndental hygiene, dental therapy, dental nursing and dental technology\nInitial Teacher Training\n\nOn the subject of an online degree, it shouldn\u2019t hamper your chances of future applications. The pandemic is a worldwide issue and everyone is being forced to adapt. I\u2019m a second year student, and while studying at home has been frustrating at times, I have been in contact with my tutors via email and Microsoft Teams regularly. I have heard that year 3 students will been taught in person in 2021/2022, so they may be a better situation in the next year, allowing in person lectures. I have heard there have been other UK universities offering poorer support, but King\u2019s has been adequate so far. Libraries are online, with the rest of the other resources (which goes without saying). Also don\u2019t forget that KCL status will not have changed due to the pandemic. I hope that answers some questions, try emailing KCL directly for more specific info.\n\nPS look up the AKC that comes complementary with a King\u2019s course.",

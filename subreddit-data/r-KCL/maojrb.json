    "postText": "So I am an American applying for admission to King's. On their site I see that Americans can get in with AP scores of 4 without any 5s. However, another part of the site says that 5s are required for certain courses. Has anybody here gotten in with scores of only 4? Would they let me in with these scores or would I be disadvantaged?",

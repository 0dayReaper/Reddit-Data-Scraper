    "postText": "Hi there. So I\u2019ve recently got an offer for KCL to study biomedical science which I\u2019m very close to making my firm choice but just have a few apprehensions/questions I\u2019d like answering. \n\nI\u2019d mainly be on the Guy\u2019s campus as that\u2019s the location of life science department but have been looking around at first year accommodation and have sort of come to the conclusion that unless I spend \u00a3325 a week on the unite students rooms I\u2019m going to be unhappy with my accommodation. Now I don\u2019t have \u00a3325 a week, and am under no impression that living in London is going to be cheap but I was wondering if anyone could tell me what the best accommodation near Guys would be for \u00a3250pw max? \n\nAlso, for anyone who has done my course or has some knowledge about it, how intensive is it and do you think it would be possible for me to get a part time job, say a few nights a week at a restaurant/bar and not completely be burning the candle a both ends? \n \nLastly I\u2019d love to hear in general about people\u2019s KCL experiences, whatever info you think would be informative or interesting for a prospective student. \n\nThanks a lot!!",

            "comment": "First year is super easy as it is just MCQ examination. You can get away with a part time job in that case. However, 2nd year will be tough, especially if you\u2019ve never been introduced to scientific essay writing, I would not advise for you to have a part time job at that time as I did the same mistake and my stress levels went through the roof. 3rd year, impossible. During that year fully focus on your degree. Work over the summer holidays so you can compensate for that year\u2019s loss of supplementary income.",

            "comment": "Though I'm not a biomed student, I shared my first year flat with one. She absolutely adores the course. It's fairly intensive, but you could get away with a part time job in the first year. Just be aware that getting a part time student job in London is near impossible at the moment, and really difficult even in normal times.\n\nAs for accommodation, I'm afraid you're just going to have to put up with rooms that don't meet your standards for a year. If you can't afford the ones you want, you can't live there. I study Theology, and one of my cohort got a Moonraker suite for his first year despite not having the money, and he was miserable all year because he was so stressed about finances and had no spare cash to enjoy himself with.\n\nI lived in Wolfson House, which is a grand total of a two minute walk to Guy's Campus. Strand is my campus, but I lived at Wolfson because it's the cheapest and was all I could afford. Yes it's basic, there are no bells or whistles, and you don't have an en suite, but truly it was great living there because I was too excited to be at uni to feel hard done by that I only had a single bed. And as for the bathroom situation, I shared a bathroom with my parents when I lived at home so I didn't mind sharing with my flatmates.\n\nLiving in London means compromising on what you want financially because you simply cannot afford everything you want to afford. The absolute best advice I can give you on living in the capital is to spend as little as you can on Accomodation (go for safe, clean, and well located over fancy) because then you'll have the money to enjoy yourself with.\n\nIf there's any other way I can help, by all means message me and I'll answer any questions.",

I\u2019m not asking for the world with my accommodation tbh, just a space that is somewhat comfortable and clean. \nYeh who knows what jobs will be like and if bars and restaurants will be open in September, Im hoping the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has taken its toll by then and the world is back to normality in time for my uni experience.",

Even though it's no-frills, it's definitely still very comfortable and clean. None of the Accomodation is bad (though I've heard the rooms in SSA are incredibly small), so you can't really go wrong. I'd definitely say go as cheap as you can because, when it gets down to it, you'll prefer the money in your bank.",

Also, since you\u2019re in London you can get more support from SFE and if your family income is below 35K you get a 1600\u00a3 bursary from king\u2019s each year as long as SFE has assessed your family income.\nGDSA is like 5 minutes from Guy\u2019s, SSA is in Waterloo, like 20 minute walk. Personally I prefer SSA since it\u2019s closer to city centre and there\u2019s more stuff in the area in general.\nAlso, since I\u2019m from EU I have to have a job to get maintenance loan. I don\u2019t recommend working more than 2 days a week, easy to fall behind in the first year. Personally I found 2nd year way more easy compared to first.",

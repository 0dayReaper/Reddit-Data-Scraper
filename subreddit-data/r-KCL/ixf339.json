    "postText": "Hi there, I am thinking of applying to the Master at King's in International Political Economy. However, so far I have not read too many good things and I am wondering why that is the case. Does anyone have any experiences with this Master or going to King's in general? \n\nI really like the courses that are being offered and that you can specialize in different regions (I am really interested in Asia). I also had a look at the same LSE Master (I always wanted to study at LSE) but it does not seem as interesting to me. \n\nAny thoughts? Or any other recommendations for nice master\u2019s degrees in that field? Any suggestions are appreciated!",

    "postText": "hi! I'm an international student (taking GCE A Levels in Singapore) planning to apply for 2022 entry, and the BA in culture, media and creative industries at King's College London is one of my top choices right now. I'm interested in the programme because it seems really flexible, interdisciplinary and covers a broad range of subject areas that I'd love to learn more about in uni. I was wondering if there's anyone here who has experience studying this course who could give me an idea of what it's like? Especially in terms of how much practical vs theoretical exposure you get, and if it's really as creative as the website says it is. Are the internship/study abroad opportunities good?  \nI'm also curious to know what it's been like taking this course in the midst of a pandemic, seeing as covid-19 doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon :(  \n\n\nthanks !!",

So far I'm really enjoying the course however the course is not as practical as it makes out to be. A lot of student concerns this year were complaining about the lack of practical stuff, but this year we got to make a documentary or audiovisual piece as an assignment (although they didn't mark it based on level of technicality so they allowed people to make PPT presentations too). Not too sure about internship and study abroad opportunities because I haven't gone through them. Let me know if you have more questions!!",

I personally don't find the management side of creative industries that engaging when we learn about audience development or creative business models. I did my whole first year online from China, so I don't know anything about the in-person seminars the others did, but doing online sucked a bit, there was no motivating factor for me to learn anything because you just show up to a teams meeting every week and people don't really discuss, you're not tested on the content, etc. I do really enjoy the assignments because you have a lot of freedom to talk about what you like, but I find it weird that we only have 1 essay per class, so that is only 4 assignments per semester. Hope this all helps!\n\nI'm curious though, what other university options are you thinking of?",

I got into both UvA and King's for the same courses and still don't know where to go. On one side King's is super prestigious and i know more people in London but i'd have to pay international fees since I'm french and live in sg... What decision did you make if I may ask ? :D",

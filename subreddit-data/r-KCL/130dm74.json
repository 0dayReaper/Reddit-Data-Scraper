    "postText": "I applied for an international foundation year with my AS levels and received a conditional offer. To fulfill the conditions of the offer, I have to achieve a certain school GPA (I am on course to achieve this). However, I am set to take my final A-levels in June. My consultant assured me that applying with AS levels is fine even if you\u2019re going to complete your A-levels, but I\u2019d like to receive some assurance. This won\u2019t be a problem, right? I don\u2019t need the A-levels anymore so I can just not show up on the test date if it\u2019ll be a problem",

            "comment": "If your requirements are just for the GPA, and is separate from the A Levels, I wouldn\u2019t be too worried. \n\nMy application included my AS results and predicted A levels iirc so my conditional was my final A level grades. So again, if your conditional only puts down GPA, then it should just be the GPA.",

    "postText": "Okay, long story short. I have rlly strict parents. My nationality is British but I moved to Saudi 2 yrs ago. I got a place to study economics at Kings (and i wanna go back to the UK so bad cause its less depressing and strict). My parents dont want me to go to the uk (even tho they're moving with me), cause they dont want me to study in a western country. They already made me take a gap year, and promised I can go after, but now theyre selfishly trying to see if I can do my economics degree online this year! Anyone who knows anything could you tell me if KCL will allow this? I got a friend to ring them up, and they said they expect all students to be there by December unless they have visa issues ext. Is it possible for my parents to lie about having visa issues/ travel issues and get away with it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease answer, my mental health is at risk, im 19 and still dont have a phone, cant go out, have friends who are a different culture, uni is my only fresh breath of air.",

King's has thousands of students and they recognise that not everyone is in a perfect situation and are always there to help. Hundreds of students request help every year. No student is a nuisance when they have genuine problems that need addressing. They have whole departments and employ people for the specific role of student welfare. I would not hesitate to contact them. This is not highschool, your professors would not know anything about this issue if you don't want them to know. Also the university has to adhere to confidentiality laws. You are 19 and if you explain the situation to the univeristy I am sure they wouldn't tell your parents. You are the student, they have a duty towards you and not your parents. Again, this won't be like highschool anymore where the parents can just call the teacher/headmaster and request a progress report on the child. You are the one going to king's not your parents. The communication between king's and yourself will only involve kings and yourself. You are an adult and the university will treat you like one.",

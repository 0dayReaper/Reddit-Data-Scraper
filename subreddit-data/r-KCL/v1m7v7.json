It's not something you would be able to do until your at the uni but it may be possible. My only thing is that mine was a single honours to a dual honours that incorporated my original subject, I'm not so confident you can switch entire subjects, e.g. psychology to law (especially qs its so competitive). I'd say at most you could switch between something like IR to European politics or something that's similar and or less competitive than the subject your originally on. So basically don't go to King's if your banking on switching to law, it seems super unlikely unless your doing law with French or something super similar.",

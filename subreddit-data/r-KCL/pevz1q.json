    "postText": "So, my IELTS result was delayed and hence my CAS hasn't been issued as of yet. The visa process will take about 21 days after I receive my CAS\n\nBut the main issue is that I from India and all International flights have been suspended until 30th September. If this suspension persists I won't be able to arrive in London when my session begins i.e. 27th September\n\nThis means I will miss my Open Days and maybe even my classes. So is it too big of a loss? I mean I would love to know the campus more and get to know people beforehand which would be a bit tough if I arrive late and is it hard to recover from initial missing classes?\n\nAnd also, is anyone else facing a similar problem? \n\nHope you guys have some answers, I am planning to contact King's regarding this as well.\n\nThanks in advance!",

You can still book and fly to the UK the moment you get your visa.\nThe best bet would be to get a priority visa done to get it in about five days rather than the regular 21 days.\n\nFrom what King's told me, a lot of courses are conducting some classes online, so it's best to get in touch with your department and enquire with them regarding online classes.\n\nI'm also from India, flying out from Goa, just waiting on my CAS.",

            "comment": "Short answer is it depends.\n\nIf you get A*AA in the other three, they likely won't give a rat's arse about the economics. \n\nHowever, that might work to your disfavour too; when I applied for History with a B in the History but AAA in maths, further maths, and physics, they said they'd accept if my history retake was an A.\n\nMy mate, however, applied for the same course in the same year, and missed his offer with ABB, the A in biology - he got accepted outright that August.\n\nAs such, it depends on the department policy and their mood that day whether they're willing to use the fourth as a benefit to your case and whether they'll withdraw/maintain the offer if you get lower than the stipulated grades. \n\nThe easiest way to avoid having to rely on luck is to focus on your other three A levels and meet your offer; unless you particularly enjoy economics, it might even be worth dropping it to cut down workload - only do it if you really aren't enjoying it though, learning for learning's sake is thoroughly admirable",

I've also seen some people mention that some rooms are released at different times on KCL's portal. Why is it released in batches? Has it got anything to do with the availability of the rooms?",

            "comment": "From what I know (might not be 100% true) rooms are released in batches to prevent all the rooms from becoming unavailable at once. The portal is opened at a certain time, and not everyone will be available at that time exactly bc of time zone differences I assume. \n\nAlso there's some rooms with really high demand, like rooms for SSA, so I think KCL releases them more slowly. When I was applying for accommodation, SSA was never available even though I went into the portal less than an hour after the portal opened. I would assume it's to give everyone a better chance at getting the rooms. \n\nOther than that, I think the rooms are first come first serve! The portal asks you to choose a room, and then it'll ask you to confirm and then they'll send you a confirmation email with the contract. So as soon as you choose a room it's yours! This was how it worked last year, but I don't know if they changed anything this year.",

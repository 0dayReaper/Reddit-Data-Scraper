    "postText": "Hey! I have an offer from King's in IR but I cannot afford it. Being an international student I am a bit iffy about taking loans as I can't really afford KCL tuition. I wanted to know from present students that is it really worth taking a loan of about 40k pounds for King's and are the placements and packages for my major (International Relations) really good enough.\n\nThanks!",

A few also keep their DMs open, so you can message them with specific queries.\n\nIt's what I'm doing at present too :)",

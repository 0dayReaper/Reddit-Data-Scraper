    "postText": "Hello! \n\nI'm looking to apply to MSc Affective Disorders for entry in 2021. I was wondering if anyone here has taken that course and is willing to share their experience with me?\n\nI am specifically looking for information regarding the teaching and, if possible, what immediate career opportunities this course could open me up to. \n\nBy extension, I would also love to hear about these things from anyone who has studied related courses at the IoPPN. \n\nThanks in advance!",

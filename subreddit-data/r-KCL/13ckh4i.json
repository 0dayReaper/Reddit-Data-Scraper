I know many international people, including from China, that did CS got software engineering jobs in London.\n\nThere's never a guarantee, but you can improve your odds by getting internships in the summers between academic years.",

The grades are mostly just to get your CV in front of a person. Very few roles care about specific classes on your transcript.",

My only problem is I haven't been able to get in contact with anyone who is on this course and can't find somebody who has shared their personal views and experience on this course at kings anywhere online. \n\nIt would be greatly appreciated if anybody on this subreddit who does general engineering ( or knows somebody who does), can help! (Please just go on a massive rant lol :) )",

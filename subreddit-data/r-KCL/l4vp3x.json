    "postText": " I am doing IB and I\u2019m pretty confident I can reach the minimum requirements, but I'm pretty sure the typical offer range would be much higher. Can anyone please provide the accurate number of the typical offer range and are there extracurricular activities or exams that I should take to increase the chance? In addition, the website didn\u2019t seem to say that STEP or MAT is a required test for computer science. Is it worth it spending time preparing and doing it?",

            "comment": "The computer science entry requirements on KCL's website state that the typical entry requirements are 35 points with 666 at HL, with Maths AA HL or Computer Science HL. (I'd say that's pretty spot on, since those were my exact offer conditions.) There aren't any admissions tests like STEP or MAT - it's purely based on your personal statement, reference letter and predicted grades. \n\nFor extracurriculars, I think the standard advice for personal statements applies - if you've done computing projects, entered competitions, taken online courses or done any internships, mentioning those can strengthen your application. If you're going for a more focused course (like compsci + AI or compsci + year abroad), it might be good to look into activities centered around those specific areas.",

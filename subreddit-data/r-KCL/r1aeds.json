    "postText": "I was wondering whether anyone here studies Neuroscience or Neuroscience and Psychology, or knows anything about these courses. I will be applying in January and am not sure which one appears to be a better prepared course. From what I know the latter one is quite new, and I was disappointed to find out there appears not to be much of laboratory work there. Maybe there are any opinions about these courses on the campus, which would make the decision easier?\n\nAlso, if you already applied, does anyone know know what IB scores do they usually admit, and are there some unusual tips for application in these particular fields?",

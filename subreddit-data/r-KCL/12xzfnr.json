    "postText": "Hello! I am attending KCL for the MSc of Addiction this fall. I am graduating from a university in Florida with a BA in Psychology and a minor in Addiction Studies this May. I have a few family members in Liverpool, so I won't be completely alone but, I would love to connect with some peers before the big move.\n\nI am interested in clinical psychology and working in correctional and rehabilitation facilities on the West Coast of the U.S. after completing my education. I have clinical research experience in opioid use disorder, and tobacco use, as well as behavioral research experience in animal and human behavior. I am really interested in contingency management as a treatment intervention. \n\nIf you are interested in connecting, please reach out! Looking forward to joining KCL.",

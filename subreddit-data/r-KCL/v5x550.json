I am an international student and I\u2019ve emailed every related email address I could find. I have yet to receive a response. It\u2019s been more than two weeks. Does anyone know any alternative way to contact the admissions team? Please help as it\u2019s urgent!\nThank you.",

It's been 2 weeks already and the ucas deadline is on Thursday (I cannot firm them until they change it). I also had issues with my conditions, they gave me conditions I had already met (gap year students), my offer should've been unconditional but here we are. pray hard and try calling them, it's much more useful.",

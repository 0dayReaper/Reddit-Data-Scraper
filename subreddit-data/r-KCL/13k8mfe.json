    "postText": "Hi, I'm going to joining kings as an undergrad in September and i've recently booked my accom at angel lane but my issue with it is that it's too far. I'm going to try and change it if I can and my top choice would be stamford since i'll be going to the strand campus, but other than that what other accoms are close enough that are also fairly social and safe etc. \n\nI'd also like to add that I'm not going to consider moonraker since it\u2019s way too expensive",

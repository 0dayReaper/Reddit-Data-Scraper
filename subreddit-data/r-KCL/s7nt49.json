    "postText": "Hey everyone! I'm currently a 3rd year student doing a 4 year B.A. in Political Science and History. I'd really like to apply for an M.A. in Political Econ at KCL however, I'm not sure whether an acceptance is realistic. I'm about half way done with my degree and I'm aiming for an upper second or first. If I keep working the way I have so far, I'm pretty confident I'll meet the minimum academic requirements. I'm also working for a research institute. Do you think that a successful application is realistic? What kind of extracurriculars would benefit my application? Cheers everyone, have a good one :)",

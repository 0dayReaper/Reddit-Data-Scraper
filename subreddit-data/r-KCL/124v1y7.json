    "postText": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI am currently a senior majoring in public health at an undergraduate institution in the US. I am interested in global health and health policy, specifically with immigrant and refugee populations. I have aspirations of going to medical school but wanted to get an MPH/MSc before I start my clinical career as it sets an important foundation for treating patients, bettering health outcomes, etc. I have a family friend who went abroad for her graduate degree in public health and her experience fascinated me enough to at least research programs abroad.\n\nI love the MSc. program in Global Health, Social Justice, and Public Policy at Kings College London but I can't seem to find too much information about the specific program other than the information on the website and some promotional videos. I was wondering if anyone had some insight or experience with the university and this specific program.\n\nThe curriculum of the school is what drew me in, but here are some concerns I have:\n\n\\-financials as an international student (would it even be \"worth\" the experiences and essentially all the money)\n\n\\-lack of CEPH certification (I know the certification is given by a US organization but all the online forums are saying a program is useless for a job without one. I plan on going to medical school, but I don't want to limit myself in case so I wanted to get other opinions)\n\n\\-how are the faculty and staff? I am looking for more mentorship relationships and not just professors and student\n\nThank you guys for baring through this brain dump of a post, any feedback and comments will be greatly appreciated!",

It\u2019s is expensive and while I could get federal student loan forgiveness in my field but I plan on staying here and working before probably going back to USA, I\u2019d like to be a place where I can have dual residency, (seems you can as well, federal direct loans are your best bet they work with all uk uni worth a damn, and I\u2019m using them for my law degree at kings)\n\nBut I\u2019ve had a great experience for better than my American undergrad, although i do miss some things about it. Like actually being a campus (which kings is better than UCL for that field), but you got a few. And being in a city you drive. The fact my undergrad has a 2 year JD programme is really tempting me to go back some time. It\u2019s a top 100 law school not greatest but $25k NY 30k everyone else tuition is amazing bargain.\n\n\nI have an American friend in my accommodation who plans on going to med school because of the clusterfuck of pricing and admissions for med school in the US. Like law school admissions expecting you to be a former navy seal 3.99999 gpa, Nobel prize winner (sorta /s)",

                            "comment": "It is an amazing def definitely needs healthcare. I paid more for a year of NHS as a student than private (sorta) in ny. I\u2019ve gone to ERs for stuff which turned out not to be serious and was seen just after being checked in. Started coughing up blood and having a hard time breathing didn\u2019t get an ambulance which a shock to some healthcare people I talked to, and coughed massive quantities of blood in the ER waiting room while I waited 10 hours to be seen. Not fully \u201cfree\u201d either because I was told I\u2019d have to pay for the CT scan, atleast no blood clot but a lesion, hopefully not cancer for bodybuilding purposes I was using IGF1 beforehand which directly stimulates cancer cell growth including muscle and bone. Those who live the longest actually have the lowest IGF1 levels. So yeah at a point in life it\u2019s a trade off. higher igf1 levels which are beneficial to young athletes \n\nSure I got a hospital bill but this was before Covid and funny thing about debts in the US when a party stops trying to collect a debt it becomes void. They\u2019re not going to stop trying to collect student loan debt tho.\n\n\nJust get theft protection on your phone and laptop in London. Pockets that zip up are best. In my area I had cheap second phone worth nothing really, had a pack of non uk Marlboro reds grabbed out of the same coat I think or fell, atleast i paid  less than 1/3rd of what the Uk wants me to pay for worst ones \n\nOh btw KCL accom are almost all south. Idk too much about that area in particular but a pretty senior officer told me i should move south my area isn\u2019t good. Same thing drug dealers have told me \ud83d\ude1b there\u2019s one that\u2019s I believe even more north east of me and I\u2019m already 2 miles from UCL granted short tube rides, but that accommodation is out of my consideration I think it\u2019s own by unite students, I currently live in one they\u2019re cool girl in my programme lives in a nicer one in King\u2019s Cross amazing view from her high rise, but I\u2019ve never lived higher than the third floor",

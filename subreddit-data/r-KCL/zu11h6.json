I\u2019m a prospective international student (from the US) currently applying for a postgraduate degree related to Conflict &amp; Security, and I am interested in learning more about the Uni. \n\nWhat is it like being a student at KCL? I would love to hear insights and perspectives on the Uni and its social atmosphere and London, and I am open to conversation!\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "I just finished an MSc at King's. My undergrad background was nothing special but I always got great marks, so to me King's was like \"the real deal\" academically. If you are passionate about the subject I'd say go for it. Socially, I'm a bit of a loner but I managed to get a few really good lifelong friends in my program.  They have a bunch of great societies and social events too. The only thing lacking is when it comes to uni accommodation. I stayed in a postgraduate accommodation and the experience was kind of mediocre. No meaningful social events or community in the building for me, just a couple roommates that maybe once a month would grab a beer. Also getting paired with random people means you WILL have a messy flatmate. If I were to do it again, I'd try to find a roommate and rent out a flat together somewhere outside of King's. \n\nThat being said, I paid international fees and found it to be worth it. Getting that degree was one of the coolest things I've ever done-I learned so much. It's challenging and rewarding. I received great support from King's staff both academically during the term and professionally after obtaining my qualification. Also my flatmate in the security course loved it. I can't speak to the security course in great detail other than I know it has a high-calibre program for security, but if you have other questions feel free to DM me.",

It can also be overwhelming (I came from suburbia). I did get sick of expensive places and pretentious attitudes, but I also found a lot of people to be warm and welcoming. If you haven't been in an environment like that before, it can be a learning experience itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou have to find your local park if you're living in a busier area. I missed seeing green. Get a plant for your room!",

            "comment": "Fine but disappointing overall considering the international fees in my case.\nI am currently a PG student, here is my take:\n- teachers are interesting and overall I enjoy the classes\n- there is very few hours of in-class teaching (8h usually) and most of the learning comes from doing the readings by yourself which was really disappointing\n- KCL Strand campus is really central so it\u2019s nice but it\u2019s also very crowded, no space to study (or you have to go to the library) or time to discuss courses after class end (I had a teacher end classes after 50 minutes so students can leave the classroom on time but 10 minutes out of 1hour is imo a huge loss of potential added value\n- Way too many Chinese students - I have nothing against them but they hardly talk during seminars where you\u2019re supposed to get the most added value \n- you won\u2019t enjoy the nice classrooms (many of them are underground)\n- administration was awful in my personal experience though you have a \u2018personal tutor\u2019 you can discuss things and sometimes they can help out\n- London is an amazing city to live in (though very expensive)\n- Most societies are for UG (I\u2019m 24 and I felt out of place with 18-20 yo even though I wanted to join)\n- Conflict and security should be in the war studies Dept which is very well known \n\nHope this helps!",

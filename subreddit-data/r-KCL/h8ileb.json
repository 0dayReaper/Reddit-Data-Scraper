The sink is next to the toilet which is next to the shower so if you shower the whole bathroom gets wets, but it does dry somewhat quickly.\nPersonally, GDS was great last year. Location wise it\u2019s one of the best places to live. If you\u2019re at Guys then you can leave 5 mins before any lecture/tut/seminar/labs. It\u2019s about 20 mins walk from Waterloo and 35 from Strand. Obviously there are bus stops nearby to make it quicker. \nThere\u2019s a Sainsbury\u2019s local across the road, or if you plan to do a cheaper shop then Lidl is 15 mins walk. There\u2019s an Asda and Tesco past Lidl as well if you need a superstore. \nIf you chose to do football/rugby/hockey there\u2019s a direct bus near GDS to and from where we train. That takes 60 mins. A quicker route is walk to Elephant and Castle train station and take the direct train there which takes 20 mins.\nIt\u2019s also across the road from KCL student bar Dover castle which pops off every Friday, Saturday and sports night on a weds. Guys sports night is really good but takes about 2 hrs to get in if you queue past 10pm, but is walking distance. If you go to Vault, there\u2019s a direct night bus N42 which takes to you from there to GDS.\n\nIdk if I\u2019ve missed anything, but if you need more info feel free to drop me a DM",

The rooms are small, but the shared kitchen is pretty big. \nThere\u2019s a nice courtyard, and a park nearby. Getting guests inside is a bit of a pain as you hand to sign everyone in AND out. \nI\u2019d rate it 6.5/10 overall",

    "postText": "I recently finished the IB Diploma Program. As I do not meet the UG entry requirements, I want to apply for the International Foundation Program. I want to do the Economics and Mathematics course, however, in entry requirements for the foundation program, it says that the IB Diploma Program is not considered for the Economics and Mathematics program. Should I still apply to Economics and Mathematics? or should I apply to the Politics and International Relations one (for which IB is considered) ? Please keep in mind that studying Economics is my top priority. It is also worth mentioning that I know a person who got into the Engineering and CS foundation program with the IB Diploma Program (like the Economics foundation program, the website says the IB Diploma Program is not considered for the Engineering and CS foundation program, but that person still got in). I am really confused about this, would really appreciate your opinions and/or experience regarding this matter",

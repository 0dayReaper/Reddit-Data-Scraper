    "postText": "Hi guys, if any law students (already enrolled or studying) do see this, what tips do you have for incoming law students? PDF versus hard copy books, societies and mooring? And also is the workload manageable, how difficult is it to balance everything with extracurriculars! Would appreciate any advice you all have in advance. Thank you!",

            "comment": "Heya! Congrats on choosing King\u2019s, it\u2019s a great law school and London\u2019s a great place to be.\n\n- Books: this depends on your budget and preferences. PDFs aren\u2019t always easily accessible, and (at least for me) it\u2019s easier to be distracted from them, so I\u2019d recommend getting physical books if you can afford it. There are three ways of doing this. The cheapest option (free) is to read the textbook in the library; this is fine, but it\u2019s an inconvenience, particularly since the law library is on Chancery Ln (near Strand) and all of your classes (assuming you\u2019re doing the vanilla LLB) will be on Waterloo for the first year. The second option would be to buy the books secondhand \u2014 there are always Facebook groups and little fairs set up for second- and third-years to sell their old books onto freshers at a significant discount (I should think it\u2019s rare that you\u2019d be spending more than \u00a315 on a secondhand book). The downside is that the law is a living organism and so there are usually new editions of the textbooks for each academic year, which\u2019ll mean your page numbers (and some elements of content) will be out of sync with those referred to by your lecturers &amp; tutors. That said, if you want to save money, you can combine this with the library strategy to make sure you get all the content you need without inconveniencing yourself too much. The final option, obviously, is just to buy the books new \u2014 it\u2019s expensive, but you can of course sell the books on and recoup a decent amount at the beginning of the next year.\n\n- Societies. There are a lot. The two most important ones are probably the Bar &amp; Mooting Society (for aspiring barristers) and the Law Society (for aspiring solicitors). I strongly recommend you visit both at freshers\u2019 fair (which may be online this year) and get an idea of what would be best for you \u2014 obviously, you\u2019re not committing yourself to a career by choosing one over the other, and the skills &amp; connections you develop will be valuable no matter what. The Bar &amp; Mooting Society runs a number of mooting competitions over the course of the year, always starting with a novice moot for people keen to get into things for the first time \u2014 *please* keep your eye out for this one. I missed it in my first year and it\u2019s one of my biggest regrets. There are also some auxiliary societies, including KIIPS (focused on intellectual property), Pro Bono Society (focused on connecting law students with charitable legal work), and some pretty dead or ineffective societies (like Lawyers Without Borders). It\u2019s not too hard to get a taste of everything without committing yourself.\n\n\n- Workload. Oh, man, it\u2019s definitely quite a bit. The best advice I got was to treat law school like a full-time job \u2014 work 9 to 5, taking breaks for lunch and for coffee. If you really apply yourself, you\u2019ll be able to get everything done for the day within those eight hours. Then, after 5, you can shut up the books and do something else with your evening. It\u2019s draining, but you\u2019ll get used to it and feel the stronger for it.",

She has an offer from Edinburgh University and I have an offer from KCL.\n\nWill online / hybrid studies be maintained throughout 2021 and 2022?\n\nWill it be possible for me to live in Edinburgh and still take part in online classes at KCL? I know I would need to travel to London eventually, but will it be an option to live in Edinburgh and pursue the MSc at KCL?",

            "comment": "The university is hoping to be back to almost fully in-person teaching next academic year, in accordance with the road map the government has set out. If all goes well, we as a nation should be back to normal by July - in plenty of time for the new academic year in late September.\n\nSo, really, if you are not specifically doing an online MSc, you will have to be present in London for the duration.\n\nObviously if things hit the fan and the road map can't be followed, there's a chance that teaching may be somewhat online to begin with, but that's worst case scenario and I wouldn't count on that at all - the uni is really striving to have as many people on campus next year as is safe and legal (which should mean everyone).\n\nWhat is your MSc specifically in? If it's something lab-based you will absolutely have to be in London throughout. If it's not lab-based, there is an incredibly slim chance that, in talking to your faculty, there may be some accommodations that could be made. I highly doubt it though.\n\nAt the end of the day though, the MSc will only be for a year and the train links between the capitals are very good. I hope it all works out for you.",

Though, if you'll just be looking for a room and a desk whilst in London - nothing fancy - I'd definitely suggest looking at Wolfson House (KCL ACCOMODATION). I was there in my first year. There are also always plenty of masters students there (and some mature students too, if you're a bit older). It's cheap, easy, and the contracts aren't for a whole year - just the academic calendar. All the best!",

I am still inclined to think they are likely to maintain a hybrid system, where some can attend in person and some can join online, but I would request you to get in contact with them to get better details on this.\n\nI would still keep the option of travelling to campus once/twice a week if required to do so.",

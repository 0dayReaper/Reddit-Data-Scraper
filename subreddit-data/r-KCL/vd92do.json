    "postText": "Hey KCL redditors! I'm an exchange student here at KCL who is moving out in a couple days and I desperately need to get rid of my kitchenware. Ideally I'd like to make some money off it; are there any (in person) services where I can dump my kitchen things and they can buy them off me? I tried posting in online classifieds but alas I had no luck. Figured I might try my luck asking the good people of the KCL reddit. \n\nFor more information: I'm at Moonraker in Southwark and I have a cart (that I'm also trying to sell) to transport the kitchenware, though it will be easier for me not to drag the kitchenware across town. Any help is greatly appreciated :)",

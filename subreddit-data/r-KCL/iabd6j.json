Would it be better to ask if it\u2019s possible now, or when I begin the course? I\u2019m a little apprehensive about it all and am aware that it may not even be possible. Thanks!",

I suppose you could try calling them again to plead your case, but your best bet would probably be to find another course through clearing. It\u2019s really tough this year.",

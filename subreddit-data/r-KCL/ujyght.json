    "postText": "Hiya! Potential undergraduate entry this September, I'm currently looking at accommodation and I can see that the Stamford Street Apartments are easily the most convenient, but how is the quality?\n\n  \nOf course I don't expect it to be too wonderful, living in a boarding school for a past few years has lowered my expectations of boarding here, but how are things actually like? E.g. are room generally clean (some photos I've found online have mould everywhere), how much difference is there between ensuite, refurbished ensuite and studio rooms (are the photos on the site still relevant?)? And how's the WiFi like?  \n\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "Its pretty clean, not mouldy as far as i recall. The carpets are a little old, the bed is kinda small, the toilet may need to be bleached several times. But its generally liveable. The wifi is fine. Can't comment on the refurbished ones but I'm guessing they put new carpets and bed frames",

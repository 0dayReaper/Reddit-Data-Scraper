    "postText": "Pretty much what the title says. I\u2019m a postgraduate moving to London for my masters, and I rented an en-suite in vauxhall for 325\u00a3 A WEEK. I have been looking around and I can see some one bedroom flats for 1350 A MONTH so that\u2019s around the same price except a bigger space with more freedom in it, yet it won\u2019t have the grad plus facilities that I will get with Vauxhall I.e the gym and BeActive classes. \nWhat are your guys experiences? Is the accommodation with the facilities really worth the price regardless of it being a squeeze?",

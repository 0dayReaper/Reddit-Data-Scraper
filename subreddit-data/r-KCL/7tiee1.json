    "postText": "How is the electrical engineering and management program at kcl (Beng) ? \nAlso, how does it compare to top engineering schools in the USA? I just got an offer with a very low conditional. This made me suspicious about the program. Is the program really good in terms of lectures, opportunities, research, professors etc. or is it just hype?\nThankyou in advance ",

I would recommend:\n\n* KCL Tech - http://kcl.tech/ (probably your best bet)\n* KCL Robotics Society - https://www.kclrobotics.com/ (also a good contact point)\n* IEEE KCL Branch - http://www.ieee-kcl.co.uk/\n* KCL Engineering Society - https://www.facebook.com/KCLEngineeringSociety?_fb_noscript=1 (I'm not sure how active this society is)\n\nThe department of engineering at King's was actually closed in 2013, with research being merged into the Informatics department (mainly the robotics group). However, King's is now reopening the department and trying to expand.",

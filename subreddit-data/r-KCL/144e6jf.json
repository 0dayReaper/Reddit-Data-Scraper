    "postText": "I'm from Miami, and I really wanted to leave for college so I applied in multiple places out of the country, and on the west coast. Out of all the US schools, Santa Clara was the best financial decision and in the UK I had only received an offer from York so I commuted to SCU. However, yesterday I received an offer from Kings College in London, which was one of my first choices when I applied. \nI've accustomed myself to the idea of moving to Santa Clara. I have family there, and I love San Francisco, it's only an hour drive a way. \nOn the other hand, I'd be moving from a fast paced city to a rural town and London does appeal to me much more in that sense. I also have family in London. \nI'd be paying practically the same for either one. \n\nI'm an english major and Santa Clara is right in Silicon valley. The emphasis around there is on tech, and it's really not my thing. I had always wanted to go to a liberal arts institution, but it just didn't work out that way. \nI guess for anyone who's read this far i'm just wondering ..\nDo I move to California or London?\nThanks",

            "comment": "If you're a US citizen (and I'm assuming you are), come to KCL. Seriously, London is a fantastic experience and you can always move back to the US. KCL has a great English faculty and much smaller class sizes than Santa Clara will. Plus, the fact that you'll only be doing English at KCL means your undergrad will be a lot more specialized. \n\nIf you really want to spend a lot of time with your family and you prefer a broader curriculum, go to UCSC.\n\nGreat choice to have!",

I would think with such a large population (Santa Clara is only 5,000), the student to teacher ratio would have a much larger gap at Kings. This is great to hear. I was picturing giant lecture halls. I'm also going to London in a couple weeks so hopefully I'll get a better idea of things.",

Id just make sure you have a place to stay while coming to uni here as KCL accommodation might be full but I'm not too sure, either way there will be accommodation somewhere in london but it's just a matter of where specifically you'll need.",

York's slightly higher in the research rankings for English and a much nicer place to live if you're not a millionaire. \n\nOn the academic side of things, since the UK university system is so much more specialised, I'd probably go for KCL over Santa Barbara if you're entirely set on literature as a path for career or study, if you want to work with field-leading researchers, and if you already have top-tier writing, logic, argumentation skills: just make sure you get to know your professors early (the more research-focused UK system means their default is not to interact so closely with undergrads as at US liberal arts colleges) and take advantage of career opportunities etc. If you're more open-minded about what you want to study, want to do double-majors/minors, especially enjoy smaller classes, or if you need to brush up on your basic writing skills etc, then a smaller-campus US college like Santa Clara would probably be better.\n\nGood luck - it's a good set of places to be choosing between.",

One thing I found that was both a boon and a bane was the fact that there wasn\u2019t really a \u201ccampus\u201d vibe (KCL is spread over multiple campuses throughout central london). I never got to experience the uni town life that my friends did, but I also managed to experience london as a student which I feel helped me transition into the workplace a lot easier. Plus, I was extremely fortunate and met and experienced some really really cool people along the way, had the time of my life. I had the choice of going to california for university too, and I sometimes have doubts whether I should\u2019ve gone with that option - but ultimately my experience at Kings and london has been incredible.",

I'm pretty nervous about the change but from what people have said London is amazing. The only thing that might be difficult is meeting new friends. Cali would be a different vibe and from what I've heard SF is a weird place to live currently. Either way ur gonna end up happy as long as you meet good people.",

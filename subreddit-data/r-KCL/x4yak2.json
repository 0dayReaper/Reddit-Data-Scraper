    "postText": "Hi all, just an incoming MA wondering how I should weigh my modules. I'm thinking of taking 5 modules (75 credits) in the first semester and three (45 credits) in the second so as to free up my time to work on the dissertation even though it's due at the end of August 2023. Is this a good idea or should I maintain an even distribution of credits across both semesters?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso important to note that I have two compulsory modules in the first semester.",

You will have plenty of time during the summer and after term 2 to work on your diss. Obviously if you\u2019re really dying to take a class, that would be a good reason to split it 5/3 but I wouldn\u2019t do it just because of your diss!",

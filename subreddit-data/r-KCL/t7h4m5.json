But it has been an overall good experience. It's not too far from campus, about a 15-20 min walk up the Waterloo Bridge (or Blackfriars if you want to go to the Maughan Library). \n\nYou could also check out UniteStudents, Chapters, and Student Halls for their options. You might find something cheaper by applying to them directly rather than through King's.",

They are halls for anyone in London universities (or a group of them) such as Kings, UCL, LSE, SOAS etc\n\nThey have catered options such as Connaught hall and are walking distance to strand- just like 10 mins down Holborn area.\n\nPlus it\u2019s great as you meet people from lots of Unis so make tons of friends and get to go to all the uni parties.\n\nCan\u2019t comment on prices as it was a while ago but there\u2019s quite a few of them of varying levels of cost and fancy ness",

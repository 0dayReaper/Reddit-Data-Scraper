    "postText": "So I've been rejected from 3 of my options ( Cambridge, imperial and UCL) which I was fairly surprised since I had 4 predicted A*s and a fairly strong personal statement according to teachers and others I had check it. I was fairly confident in getting into UCL but seeing the rejection kinda brought me back down to earth. I have offers from queen Mary and Kings but I just plopped down Kings for general engineering as a place to fill in the gap without looking too much into it. I want to know how good it is for the course and I'm slightly worried that you cannot specialise in a specific branch as its not clear on the course overview. I know the uni is a good one as it ranks in the top 10 for the uk but it doesn't really specialise in engineering and some places said it ranks somewhere around 200 for it and I want to know it this is true. Will it effect my job prospects? Should i instead accept my queen Mary offer for mechanical engineering? Thanks",

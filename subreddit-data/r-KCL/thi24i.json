They have higher rates, take your money and leave you with pretty much nothing. On our floor we had 1 working toilet and 2 working showers for 17 of us. Constantly trying to get them to fix it and they didn't care. Never even sent anyone out to look for the first 6 months. Then when everyone had finished up for summer they tried to tell everyone that they were breaching contract by moving out. These are just 2 of the bigger issues. They really need to be kept away from if you want a good 1st year",

    "postText": "Hi Guys!\n\nMy name is Matt and I'm a senior university student studying Fashion Merchandising. I'm new to this subreddit and am conducting a survey for my senior thesis. I would love your to hear your responses on how brand loyalty\u00a0habits towards luxury fashion brands during the global pandemic has affected intent to purchase. We conducted a descriptive research design between some of the top designer brands regarding the some following factors:\n\n1. Product Quality\n2. Scarcity\n3. Social Media Engagement\n4. Economic Consciousness\n5. Brand Loyalty\n6. Intent to Purchase\n\nIf you could please take a few minutes to complete this survey, it will be much appreciated!

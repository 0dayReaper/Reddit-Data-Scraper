    "postText": " \n\nHi guys, I'm an MSc Mental Health Studies student at King's and currently conducting an online questionnaire study for my dissertation. We are looking for people who are currently completing or have completed their bachelor's degree at a UK university to participate.\n\nWe are investigating differences in attitudes towards help seeking between students who were the first in their immediate family to go to university and those who weren't. \u00a350 Amazon eGift cards will be given out to 10 randomly chosen participants.\n\nHere is the link to the questionnaire: [https://kclbs.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_escsfJStJdvzirr](https://kclbs.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_escsfJStJdvzirr)\n\nThanks!",

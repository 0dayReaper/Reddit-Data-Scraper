            "comment": "Former college hall resident - I loved it. The rooms are decent, the catering service is generous, theres an alright courtyard which is fun to hang out in (...and smoke in), and the central location is nice as it's near all the tourist fun bits but is on a quiet side road. Having senate House library so close is amazing, you get free entry as part of UoL and it's a beautiful place to study. Plus they always seemed to have movie sets/trailers outside!\n\nAlso good location for clubs, OXYO/Loop/Roxy are nearby, rarely needed to get a taxi back as a group because it was very walkable. Honestly yes college hall is expensive but I found it a good experience. Plus OMG I forgot, the student union bar is right opposite and if you get a room overlooking it you can judge the vibe before you commit to going out. \n\nRussell Square is also a lovely spot to have nearby in the spring/summer. Transport links also great. Nice walk in summer to King's too, lots of little streets to explore. \n\nAs I said, I really enjoyed it despite the expense.",

Was near Edgware Road/Marylebone not far from Lillian Penson and took about 50 mins to walk to Strand and that was via Oxford St. Was a nice mix of KCL, SOAS, LSE, UCL, RADA, RCM and Birkbeck students so great way to meet people, I was there in 2015/16 and I\u2019m still in touch with friends from SOAS etc today! They had a lot of socials when we started too including open top bus tour around London for free and we had formalish parties in the JCR with the music students performing (double bass etc) with a casino theme so very cool!",

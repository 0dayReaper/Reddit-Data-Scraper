    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am conducting research in to how associative memories are formed and updated. I need participants to take part in 4 online sessions. You get paid a small amount for your time (\u00a315) and can earn extra through doing well on tasks (up to an extra \u00a316).\n\nYou complete the whole thing from home so it's a good way to earn a little bit of money, pass the time in lock down, and help out with research.\n\nIf you would like more information or to sign up please follow this link:\n\n[https://uclpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_8kNkepJZeaG4UE5?fbclid=IwAR2B9At99McWYi6VrVgF2VPArzFbzgzCOaoYmn\\_5ZMn5ggQC10lPW9XHUAg](https://uclpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8kNkepJZeaG4UE5?fbclid=IwAR2B9At99McWYi6VrVgF2VPArzFbzgzCOaoYmn_5ZMn5ggQC10lPW9XHUAg)\n\nThanks!",

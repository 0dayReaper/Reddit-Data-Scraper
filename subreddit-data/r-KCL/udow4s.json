    "postText": "Hello guys. As mentioned in the topic, I have received an LLB offer in March and I'm torn between my current job and a second degree in KCL. I've had bad experiences with my first degree and I am not satisfied with my prospects in life, so I see this offer as a new lease of life, a chance to meet like-minded people, a path to redemption, whilst I'm still young.\n\nI'd love some advice from you guys before I make my decision, how welcoming is KCL to senior students? Is there anything I need to keep in mind, and how different will my experience be compared to ordinary freshmen? For those who have experience with the LLB programme, may I ask if there are any precedents for senior students?\n\nThank you very much. Here's hoping our paths would meet this coming fall!",

I dropped out from my first course because I had a bad time (strikes, harassment from flatmates) and I got a job as a manager for a year and half, working basically every day over COVID-19. So yeah, I didn\u2019t want to move from that and take a step back either, but in the long run university is the smartest choice. Drop me a DM if you want to talk.",

I co-own a driving school, therefore had no time for passions of mine such as further education until last year as the business is doing well enough for me not to be as hands on. \n\nI turned 26 last September and will be turning 27 for my second year. In my experience, the university is extremely accommodating for older students, offering things such as accommodation with people that are closer to your age if you apply with King\u2019s accommodation. You won\u2019t feel any different being around the youngsters either. Your experience will be no different to anyone else\u2019s. Everyone\u2019s here to learn and is too busy with studies and life in general for any differences in age to matter.",

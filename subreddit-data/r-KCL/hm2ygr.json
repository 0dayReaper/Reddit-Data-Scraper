You need to follow up everything.\n\nIt's in the War Studies department which is one of the most renowned in the university and lots of phenomenal IR scholars such as Ned Lebow. The modules are varied but Western centric unless you're specifically looking for the post-colonial lens. I made many fantastic friends and connections through the course.",

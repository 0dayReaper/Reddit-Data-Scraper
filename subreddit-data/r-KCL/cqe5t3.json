    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am an International student from America, studying at King's College for the Spring of 2020. I am very excited, but also a little nervous, especially when it comes to housing. My family wants me to live in the intercollegiate halls, as they are catered, which works out better for all of us. I have a few questions regarding housing, classes, and student life\n\n1. Regarding the intercollegiate halls, which hall has a lot of kings students, especially those who are not first-year since I am going into my third year at university?\n2. Which hall has the best-catered food? I heard International Hall food is not the best, to say the least.\n3. This one worries me the most: I will need to move out during the first week of June at the latest. However, I saw the move out date for some residences will not be until the 20th of June. What should I do to make sure I can move out earlier? I can't stay longer than very early June, as I will probably be doing summer classes next year.\n4. How social is Kings? My social life at my own University (UC Riverside), was great until early 2019, and I hope studying abroad can allow me to come out of my comfort zone, and be more socially active.\n5. I will probably be taking about four film studies, digital humanities, and theater classes. How hard are these classes, and what are the exams/essays like?\n\nThank you in advance, and I am very excited (and nervous) for January.",

The move out date is just the deadline/the point up until which rent will have to be paid. As such, you would be able to leave as soon as you've taken your last exam in May. \n\n4) King's is obviously a city university, so there isn't a huge amount of Campus based interaction, but there are hundreds of societies for all sorts of different interests. Most of these are run through the Student Union, and a list can be found on the KCLSU website (www.kclsu.org).\nHowever, all London unis are pretty low on student happiness rankings for a reason. It's expensive, stressful, and can be exceptionally lonely; living in halls should help with this bit, however, and joining societies is a surefire way of making some friends, at least.\n\nHope this helps",

            "comment": "Sadly not that many kings students go to intercollegiate halls, its mainly UCL students and mainly first years. If you want to be in catered halls that's something you'll just have to deal with unfortunately - not trying to be negative but just want you to know what you're going into :) \n\nIn terms of socialising, I'd recommend just really putting yourself out there and joining up to societies and going to socials. You could very easily end up not socialising at all unless you put some effort in. Just sign up to a bunch of stuff and see where it goes. \n\nAnd it's already been awnsered but yeah, you can move out anytime you like! Trying to end on a positive here ahahhah!",

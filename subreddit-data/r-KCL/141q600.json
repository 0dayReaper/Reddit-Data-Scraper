    "postText": "I am an international student who received an offer to study law at KCL and am under 18 upon entry. I was told in the offer letter that I need to complete an agreement to study form since I am under 18. The deadline for the completion of the form was dependent on my \"acceptance of offer date\" (see attachment), which I am assuming is the date I made my decision on UCAS. If this is the case, I would have firmed Kings before May 19th, meaning it was due on June 1st. The offer letter also stated the form would be sent to me through the portal.\n\nI received the form on June 1st on my portal, and completed it on June 4th. Even though this is later than the deadline of completion, will it be OK, especially considering I received it on the day it was due?",

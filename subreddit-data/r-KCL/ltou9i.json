    "postText": "I am looking for UK undergrad students who will be sitting an exam this summer and would like to take part in a research study looking at stress and coping styles around exams. The study involves answering 4 short questionnaires at 4 timepoints: twice before, then during and after the exam period. It is expected that it will take no more than 20 minutes at each time point. All answers will be confidential and the study has received approval from the University of Lincoln Ethics Committee. If you sign up there will also be the chance to win \u00a350 at each timepoint.\n\nAny questions please contact me on: [08161248@students.lincoln.ac.uk](mailto:08161248@students.lincoln.ac.uk) or click the link for full information sheet.\n\n[https://unioflincoln.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_9Y6rRv0r1mMgF7v](https://unioflincoln.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9Y6rRv0r1mMgF7v)\n\nThank you!",

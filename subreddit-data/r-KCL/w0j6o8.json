    "postText": "Hey guys, I have a slight problem and I need guidance. On the 6th of June I got my IB results and since I met the requirements, I got an offer at Kings. The next day I paid the deposit on the pay website without paying through the kings apply page. Because of this, the next day, although I paid, on the king\u2019s apply page it updated and said I had to pay the deposit. I\u2019ve sent a message to credit control and they\u2019ve confirmed that I have paid. I also sent a message on kings apply to the admissions team but it\u2019s taking forever for them to respond. I\u2019m really anxious right now because I also have to apply for a student visa and I don\u2019t know if this slight problem is a big problem or not. What should I do and how long does it usually take for the admissions team to respond???",

I also sent them a message asking if they received it, and they said: \n\n\u2018Dear xx\n\nThank you for your message. I can confirm your CAS is currently in progress. We are currently working our way through a large number of CAS, but we will certainly issue your CAS as soon as possible. Please do continue to keep a check on King's Apply, where the next steps for the CAS will be updated. We thank you for your patience whilst we process a large number of CAS.\n\nKind regards, Caitlin\nKing's College London Admissions\u2019\n\nSo don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s okay!",

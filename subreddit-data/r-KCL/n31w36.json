And it has bus, underground and railway stations nearby so the transportation is perfect (But you should also take the noise of passing trains into consideration).\n\nAnd the most important thing if you finally decide to choose this residence, do choose a non-ensuite room or a studio rather than an en-suite, because the latter one is too small and narrow.",

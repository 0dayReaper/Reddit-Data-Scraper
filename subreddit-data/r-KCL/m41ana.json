    "postText": "Hi everybody,\n\nI recently received an acceptance into a master's programme at KCL. I have received acceptances to other schools, but KCL is one of my top choices as of know. I still do not know what direction I want to head, but I would love to get a feel for what the uni is like from your perspective (i.e. what are you favorite things about KCL, do you find that you have enough free time in between your studies, etc.). And, as a side question since I am coming in as an international student, do grad students usually live on campus or off? \n\nAny guidance would be appreciated. Thank you so much!",

I\u2019ve zeroed in on a student accommodation called Urbanest.\n\nIt\u2019s a little on the expensive side but it seems reliable given the amenities and location.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nI'm an international student and have received a conditional offer from KCL. I sent my query about the offer on 3 December 2023 but until today (23 January 2023) I still haven't heard back from them. I have sent three follow-up messages and checked with the live chat agent, but they told me to wait and that the team will get back to me as soon as possible. My peers all received responses within two weeks. However, almost two months after I sent my enquiry, I have yet to receive an answer and the deadline for accepting the offer is fast approaching. Without their response, I cannot make an informed decision.\n\nPlease could anyone advise any possible way to contact the team? Thank you so much for your help!",

Most will ignore you but try the one meant for enrolled fee assessment, I think that one was understanding of my situation and informed someone in charge. (I included my UCAS and king\u2019s ID)\n\nThere is probably also a phone number they have for undergraduate admissions you could try, but it can get pricey if you call from abroad.",

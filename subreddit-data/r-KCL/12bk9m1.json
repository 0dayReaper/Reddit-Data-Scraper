    "postText": "The Situated Intervention Design group from KCL's Department of Informatics is developing a digital intervention to help support the cultivation of body-awareness and we need your feedback. We are seeking female participants aged 18-30 years who would like to improve their relationship with food and/or body but have no clinical history with eating disorders to participate in a study which aims to generate feedback for digital body-awareness practices.\n\nParticipants will join a Slack group where a short digital body-awareness practice will be posted each week for 5 weeks and will be asked to provide feedback. There will also be a 20 minute group discussion video-call each week. You will receive up to \u00a350 for participating.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me (Phoebe Staab - [phoebe.staab@kcl.ac.uk](mailto:phoebe.staab@kcl.ac.uk)) if you have any questions. Please follow the QR code below to review the information sheet which provides details on data storage and to provide consent. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3itmsirehvra1.png?width=1188&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bc298a9f8b681665de0218b1e990187b202a94f2",

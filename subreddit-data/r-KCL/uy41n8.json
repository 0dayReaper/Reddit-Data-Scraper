I\u2019ve only been able to find a few reviews but I saw quite a few complaints about the elevators being down at Vauxhall a lot. That said, their prices are better and it\u2019s slightly closer to my campuses. Does anyone have any experience or insight into which is more worth the price?",

Rooms are nice and fairly clean building, other than the far right elevator that's rarely clean. Vauxhall is a gentrified area, so it's alright, down brixton it's less safe.",

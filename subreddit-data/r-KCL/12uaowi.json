    "postText": "Hello! I'm working on a story about innovative student housing and looking for a resident of Stephen Taylor Court at King's College to share some comments about what living there is like. (I've already spoken with the architect and want some feedback from residents.)\n\nIf you live there, please feel free to comment below for potential inclusion in the story! Ideally you would share your age/area of study as well, but if that's too personal I understand.\n\nThank you for your time!",

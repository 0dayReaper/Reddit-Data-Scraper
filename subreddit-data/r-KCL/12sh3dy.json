    "postText": "**\\*For U.S. International Students who have recently been offered a conditional offer from KCL..!!\\***\n\nI was recently offered a conditional offer from the KCL sociology department. My entry requirement was to obtain a 55444. In my offer letter, I was provided with a link that showed the list of entry requirements specifically for U.S. students. In this link, there was a list of combinations of SAT - Subject test, SAT (regular), and AP exams. In the list, I saw that I met one of the entry requirements which consisted of obtaining a 700 or above in SAT subject test, SAT at 1350, and one 5 and one 4 in AP exams. I emailed the sociology admissions team, asking them to update my offer. However, I got a response from them that I don't meet the entry requirements because KCL is not considering SAT subject test scores anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, recently I was also offered a conditional offer from the history and international relations department of KCL as well. The admissions officer updated my entry requirements from 55544 to receiving two 5's on AP exams, 700 or above in SAT subject test, and SAT at 1350. \n\nDoes anyone know which department is right? The website doesn't mention anything about KCL not accepting SAT subject test scores anymore. Is KCL actually not accepting SAT subject test scores anymore? Was anyone able to change their entry requirements from only AP exam scores to a combination of AP scores, SAT subject test scores, and SAT score? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

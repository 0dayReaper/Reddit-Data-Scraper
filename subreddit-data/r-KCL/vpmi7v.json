    "postText": "Everyone, we need your help. \u200b\n\u200b\nPlease sign and share this petition to end institutional discrimination against students with mental health problems in the UK. \u200b\n\u200b\nKing's College London's Counselling service and Student Conducts &amp; Appeal have been bullying a student from our programme for 4 months and refused to apologize. She is an asylum seeker from Hong Kong, estranged, and has multiple disabilities. Rather than providing her support, they gaslighted and ignored her again and again despite they promised they would ensure that students are safeguarded in the university. This is beyond unacceptable and disgusting. For more information such as the student's testimony, please click the [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfIZBMm7-So3a-dLbpjm-BigEKnhWVh_8szD1gspISAyfmxYA/viewform).\n\nSince there simply was no other way but to go public, now the student is forced to risk her personal safety to let the world know: Human rights must be defended; no one should be discriminated against based on their disabilities and other protected characteristics. This is a serious infringement of human rights and it brings shame to the UK as the land of the free. \n\nWe urge you to stand with us.\n\u200b\nHere are our 4 demands:\u200b\n1. Immediately fulfill the student's demands listed in the original complaint and apologize\u200b\n2. No repercussion for any King's student or staff member who supports us\u200b\n3. Make concrete plans to prevent similar incidents from happening again\u200b\n4. Provide practical and useful help to the student \u200b\n\u200b\nWe will not give up.\u200b \n\nThis is not just about King's students. To put an end to the suicide epidemic among students in the UK, we must do something. \n\nMental health matters. Students' lives matter.\n\u200b\nFree academia, revolution now.\u200b\n\u200b\nThank you.\u200b\n\nCritical Theory MA\nDepartment of French\nKing's College London\n-----------------------\nHere is a list of things you can do to help:\n1.

I just got an offer to do my postgrad at KCL and i have a long term mental health condition: But in my undergrad Uni in Bristol, we had a massive student suicide epidemic too and the Uni did absolutely nothing to help students or make concessions in relation to their mental health. A mutual friend of mine died and the family had to take the case to court, they\u2019ve only recently won the case",

They have no sense of shame and remorse. They certainly have no regards to human rights and code of ethics either. Students'lives are nothing to them. My advice is DO NOT seek help from their counselling, and anything you say to student services can be twisted and used against you whenever and in whatever ways they want. The system is corrupted. Good luck.",

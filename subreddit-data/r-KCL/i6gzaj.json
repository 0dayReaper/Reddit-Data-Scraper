    "postText": "I did not submit an english proficiency tests score by July 31st. If I meet my conditional offer will I be able to take the IELTS before my course starts and still get accepted? I need 3 A\u2019s and a Band B english test. This was an oversight as I have a B with IGCSE english but no speaking, which I recently discovered is required: \n\nTL,DR: can I get accepted if I don\u2019t meet the english condition?",

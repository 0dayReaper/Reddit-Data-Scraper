    "postText": "So I am an American student who wants to apply to multiple top British universities, including King's College London. However, I have heard claims by a variety of Brits and Americans who claim that British universities do not look at the grades or transcripts of American applicants. Instead, that these top universities only review separate admissions requirements such as standardized testing and AP/SAT Subject Test Scores, completely disregarding grades/transcripts. I was also told that Americans may have an easier time getting into top UK schools, since Americans pay more tuition than British applicants.\n\nIs it true that British universities do not consider, or even look at American grades/transcripts, or have I been lied to? Also, would I have an easier time getting into schools like KCL just because I will bring in  extra money?",

            "comment": "hi! i'm an american student as well (junior) looking to apply later this fall. i've met with and talked to many representatives from UK universities. honestly, they don't really pay that much attention to transcript or GPA at all because of how inflated certain GPAs are depending on your school. at some schools, a 93 could qualify for an A+ (4.0) whereas other schools require a 97 or above for an A+. with that being said, they really do emphasize the standardized testing scores as british A-levels and GCSEs are more difficult than APs, SATs, ACT to begin with which is why the American-equivalent entry requirements seem higher than you'd expect for certain courses.\n\nas for Americans having an easier time than Brits when it comes to getting accepted into unis, that's generally an accurate claim. university tuition is the same across the board for home students no matter what subject you're studying which is totally different from the states. therefore, UK unis do rely heavily on international students' tuitions for their funding. the only subjects where being an international student actually proves to be a disadvantage would be medicine, dentistry, or veterinary sciences because the UK government places a 7% cap on international admissions whereas there is no cap for home/EU/EEA students. for example, if KCL admits a totally of 300 dentistry students in the 2020-2021 application cycle, only 21 out of those 300 students can be international students. for all other subjects though, i'm pretty sure Americans (or all internationals for that matter) have it easier!\n\ni hope this answers you question and feel free to ask for clarification on anything else :)",

It\u2019s obviously not luxurious, but if you and your roommates keep it clean and tidy then you\u2019ll be okay. I would say the bathrooms are the worst part, being that everyone shares them and they are definitely small, but they do get cleaned regularly. If you\u2019re having other issues with the accommodation (cracked walls, faulty lights/pipes, mold, etc.) then that\u2019s something that you can contact the college about because it\u2019s legally their responsibility to fix it as long as it wasn\u2019t your fault. All in all you get what you pay for, and you will only be there for one year anyway, you could use this year as a chance to save up some money and get a different accommodation next year if you end up truly hating this one.",

I would also recommend getting a pair of shower shoes if you\u2019re worried, you can get them pretty cheap online. Although I would recommend cleaning the bathroom when you first get there, but I would recommend that for any accommodation regardless",

Trying to get 14 people to clean up after themselves consistently was a struggle and often the place was a mess. That being said, there are cleaners in the communal areas, but you have to keep on top of dishes and the bins.",

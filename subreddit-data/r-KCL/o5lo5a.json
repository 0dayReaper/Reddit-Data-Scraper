    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI just got an offer for the MA in Critical Theory at KCL and I am searching for informations to help me decide wether to accept it or not. I got also an offer for the MA Psychosocial Studies &amp;  Psychoanalytic Studies at Birkbeck. \n\nIs there perhaps anyone with insights on the course? I would be really grateful to obtain more information about the modules. I love the description of the core module \"Main Currents in Critical Theory\" but I am afraid the interdisciplinarity of the option modules make the whole MA somewhat \"sloppy\" (not a native speaker) or random, if you understand what I mean. \n\nI'd also be grateful to get some general tips on how to find out more information about courses, like where to find the syllabus of a module or anything similar. I depend on online research since I am not from the UK.\n\nThank you all for taking the time to read my post!",

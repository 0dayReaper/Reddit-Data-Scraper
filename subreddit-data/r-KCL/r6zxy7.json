    "postText": "Hi guys! so this is my first time applying for an international school (from CA)  but I guess I\u2019m just scared I won\u2019t get in ): and I really want to get in..I'm a pre-nursing junior (it\u2019s my first undergrad). I have an AA in general studies, completed all my pre-reqs (cum GPA~3.4/3.5), cpr certified, &gt;200hrs of volunteering at a local hospital, TEAS exam score: 84.7% and CNA certified. I do have a couple letters of recommendations from some nurses I know as well as work experience but i know cal states are freaking competitive but what do u think of my chances? or should i try changing my major + going another route cus my end goal is CRNA or PA? I do want to be engaging in another country i guess I\u2019m just nervous on my first application!",

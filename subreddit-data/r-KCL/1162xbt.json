    "postText": "Hello, I'm an international student planning on studying in London. I'm between two programmes I've been offered:\n\n**BA/BSc Politics** from King's College London (KCL)\n\nand\n\n**LLB Law and Politics** from Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)\n\nI've heard KCL is a more prestigious uni in a better/more central location,  and that QMUL has a so-so reputation. QMUL is quite a bit cheaper as  well as being a law degree, but if it's not a good degree I feel like I should go to King's. Does anyone have any advice?",

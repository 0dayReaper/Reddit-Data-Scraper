There's more refurbished rooms then at the beginning of the year ig but I literally don't know anyone with refurbished rooms in their flat. Tbh ssa isn't great except for the location, I'd really avoid living here if you can",

Vauxhall was nicer than my actual apartment back home, but it's expensive af and I think it's gonna be only for postgrad students next year anyway. I quite like gds, the rooms are a bit nicer than ssa, their bathrooms are actual wetrooms, and from what I've seen the social life seems to be better than here\nStill though, ssa is fairly cheap and in a great location. The quality of the rooms isn't great, but it is kind of worth it for the location, especially if you're at the waterloo or strand campus",

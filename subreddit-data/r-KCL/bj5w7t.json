    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nSo I'm making my firm and insurance choices now (late, I know), and I am trying to decide which order I put my choices. I am looking at Southampton and Kings (alternate offer from Southampton of A\\*A\\*B makes KCL first an option), and I am weighing up pros and cons of each uni. KCL stands out more to me atm but I want to be sure and want to make sure I can justify as much as I can over Southampton.\n\nI want to do an optional module in psychology at some point during the course, and I know Southampton makes this possible easily but I can't find anything online about this for KCL and want to ask if anyone knows if this kind of thing is possible? I tried calling the admissions office earlier today and they cut off partway through, then I could only call around now but it's closed at the moment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould really appreciate any help from anyone that can, applying by midnight tomorrow lol",

KCL is also a very global university and, the comp sci department is pretty good too. The resources available are of vast quantities (we are a Golden Triangle uni, so we are very rich basically) and Bush House is a beautiful setting to study at. I don\u2019t know much about Southampton or the psychology module but I hope this helped.\n\nI go to KCL and have taken comp sci modules",

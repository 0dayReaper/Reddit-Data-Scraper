Intl student here, I recently got into Kings College London for their IR programme. \n\nJust wanted to know if there\u2019s anyone here who could share their experience or feedback on the same and if I decide to come in, what can I expect in terms of academic rigour and opportunities.\n\nLastly, congratulations to the class of 2025! Each one of us have worked really hard in the past 4 years and it\u2019s finally time to kick back and savour this moment :)\n\nThank you for helping me out!",

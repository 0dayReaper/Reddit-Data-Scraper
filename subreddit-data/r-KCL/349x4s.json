Be sure not to hold the button though, that will turn the computer off.\n\nAlso, you could do just pull up a blank powerpoint slide and put it on full-screen presentation mode, that will also prevent the computer from logging off. nb - posted from maughan, all-nighter. ugh",

Full screen presentation easier than YouTube so I'm going with that!\n\nI feel your pain, I've had plenty of late nights and not enough sleep myself the last couple of weeks. Good luck with your exams/essays!",

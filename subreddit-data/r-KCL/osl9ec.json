    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nsoon I'll start studying at the Center for Transnational Legal Studies (joint venture of Georgetown, KCL, NUS, Melbourne, Toronto and a few more), currently searching for accommodation and wanted to ask if you have any advice on which groups to join/who to ask for that purpose. We're enrolled at Georgetown Law but have our courses at KCL (Bush House) and can also use most KCL services like libraries and health care, with housing being an exception unfortunately. I'm also reaching out to friends of mine at KCL, UCL etc and think I might be successful that way, but since I'm searching on relatively short notice here (need something from August/September) I just wanted to make sure to use all opportunities there are.\n\nAny advice is appreciated :)",

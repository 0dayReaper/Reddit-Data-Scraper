I checked my course page but only one course has a description hyperlink. I\u2019m wondering if I should wait a few days because maybe they haven\u2019t updated/uploaded the descriptions yet or if there is another place to find this information? (MA-IPE if it helps)",

Then you register to KEATS, and go to your faculty's page where you also have to sign up with a \"key\" which should be given on the previous page. It's quite unintuitive and deffo not used friendly, read everything the pages tell you and you'll find how to get to the next stage eventually",

    "postText": "Hi,  \nI\u2019m Natalie, a PhD student at Oxford Brookes University. In my research I\u2019m interested in student mental wellbeing. I want to find out how to support students in seeking help for their mental wellbeing when they feel they need to. \u00a0\n\nAs part of my research, I\u2019m currently running an online survey. This survey asks questions related to mental wellbeing and your current help-seeking behaviours. The survey takes around 10 - 15 minutes to complete and is completely anonymous. **Everyone that completes the survey also has the chance to enter a prize draw to win a \u00a3100 Amazon voucher.**\n\nIf you are available to take part, the link to sign up is below:  \n[https://brookeshls.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_dopc1HkGRG3Gd8i](https://brookesunion.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=09ca714907994b35722be5ac1&amp;id=7233ec7957&amp;e=452923b017)\n\nThank you,  \nNatalie\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wf29lozkd3v81.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ddd3c1c12061f77614d9e4843135ce19834cdd43",

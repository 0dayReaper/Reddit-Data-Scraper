Does anyone know how many people you are in a flat with/share a kitchen with? Would really appreciate any info as there aren\u2019t a ton of options left for accommodation so I want to make sure I get somewhere I don\u2019t have to share a kitchen with 35 people or so\nAlso if anyone has any general tips about atlas I\u2019d appreciate that too!",

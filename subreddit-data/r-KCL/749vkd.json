I've had my eye on King's for a while due to its really high prestige however i've heard a lot of horror stories about things like the facilities and lecturers not giving a toss. Can anyone give me an insight into the student satisfaction rating and the pros and cons of going? Im planning to study computer science.",

            "comment": "Firstly, don't choose a uni based just on prestige, choose one with high academic rankings (in your subject of choice, not just the uni), and one with great student satisfaction. \n\nIn terms of getting information to make your decision, I think you would have better luck contacting one of the computer science student groups at kings, e..g the tech society http://kcl.tech/ or robotics society https://www.kclrobotics.com/. This subreddit isn't very active, and you'll get much more subject relevent info from those groups.\n\nIn terms of the facilities, the Informatics department (of which computer science is under) has recently moved to Bush House, and has a lot of new fancy computer labs. There is also the Wheatstone Inovation Lab, which is open to computer science / physics students to do their own research projects outside of the course https://twitter.com/wheatstonelab?lang=en. I'm not sure how this compares to facilities at other universities, but I know that lecturers here are very interested in trying to expand and improve what facilities we have.\n\nLeading onto your statement about lecturers not giving a toss, I don't think this is accurate. Lecturers I have worked with in computer science are very interested in really making sure students get the most out of their time here. There have been large changes in how many of the first-year programming modules have been taught the last few years, to move towards a greater practical project based work (as opposed to just lectures and exams), with the aim of improving the quality of the education.\n\nOf course there are horror stories. I myself had one lecturer about 5 years ago, whose performance resulted in the whole class raising a complaint. However, you'll find that this occurs accross the whole of HE, to varying degrees. But, the department at King's is very willing to listen to feedback (we have feedback forms for each of the modules, and these show a high satisifaction from the students, and well as feedback on what can be changed). Based on this feedback, there have been changes over the last few years to try to raise student satisfaction.\n\nOne con however is the fact it is in the middle of the city. I've only ever studed in city universities, but many of my colleagues who studied in campus universtities in the UK (e.g. Essex, Sussex) have said that student life is much more limited in the city (as counter-intuative as that may sound), and they feel that they enjoyed themselves socially more out on a campus.\n\nRelated to this, King's is also a research-intensive universtity. This is not to say that teaching is sidelined, but the majority of the work going on is research based (I think a lecturer would give about 1/4 of their time teaching, 3/4 research). Again, colleagues who have studied at other universtities where this time is more shifted to teaching, have found that the teaching is often better (anecdotal evidence), at the detrement of research. However, this problem is well known for computer science at the department, and as such they have invested in hiring teaching only faculty positions, whose sole aim is to run the teaching components of courses. This has previously worked really well for the first-year programming course, where student satisfaction shot up (and you could see that the student's programming ability massively improved).\n\nIn conclusion, theres really so many different variables. I would recommend contacting the student societies to find out what they think.",

I love all these unis purely because they're campus and they seem friendly and could see myself enjoying my time there.\n\nThe reason I was mainly looking at King's is that it is in my range as well as of course being russell group, london university and looked greatly upon - all these features differ from my other selection of unis.\n\nI'm just very nervous about applying due to the fact when I went on the open day it seemed very intimidating with these grand buildings and being in the heart of London. This accompanied by the low student satisfaction rating, having to live the expensive london life and other king's students telling me about how teachers dont support them/ focus more on their research rather than teaching. \n\nWhat did you personally study there and how did you enjoy your time? Would you recommend me applying? The only reason i'm so hesitant is that I didn't like the look of it from what I saw on the open day compared to other universities however I am scared I am making a mistake by not taking the opportunity to potentially go to such a high ranking and prestigious uni.\n\n",

If you choose somewhere you don't enjoy, your academic perfomance will greatly suffer. \n\n&gt; and looked greatly upon / prestigious\n\nI think you need to be careful about that in terms of future expectations. For graduate jobs, employers aren't always interested in **where** you got the degree from, but rather **what** you did during your degree. These two often overlap, high ranking universities are often high ranking because they offer students much more, but you need to look in depth and see what your individual course itself offers. For example, in computer science, employers often like applicants who have experience in actual projects (e.g. hackatons/group work/etc), so a university with an active CS society that does events both internally and externally would be very benefitial.\n\n&gt; What did you personally study there and how did you enjoy your time?\n\nI studied computer science as a BSc. To be completely honest, I didn't really enjoy my time there as an undergrad, because I treated the degree as just another bunch of classes to attend and exams to take. Because I commuted into London daily,  I didn't get involved much in student socities/additional activites (like I mentioned above). However, thats just **my** experience of the social life in London, I can't talk for other people. \n\n&gt; Would you recommend me applying?\n\nI don't think I could answer that one way or the other, I think you need to weight up all the pros and cons and see if it is right for you. Theres a lot of consider, the cost of living, the opportunities, social stuff. I can say however, if your main pro for choosing King's is just the high prestige, then don't choose it. See below\n\n&gt; however I am scared I am making a mistake by not taking the opportunity to potentially go to such a high ranking and prestigious uni.\n\nTo be honest that resonates a lot with me, I was torn between King's and Reading when I went through UCAS. King's ranking was one of the main reasons why I choose it, however, I do something wonder what could have been if I chose Reading instead. \n\nPersonally, I think that you shouldn't focus on the ranking at all, you should focus on what the university and the course can offer you in terms of practical experiences and skills. No employer is going to say \"Well, this guy knows his stuff, has lots of experience in X, but went to Sussex instead of King's, so lets not hire him\". We've got people in our lab who studied all over the UK (and abroad), and the most important factor is they know their stuff, not that they have a degree from Y (granted, it is a research lab, not a business).",

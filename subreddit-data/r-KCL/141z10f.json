    "postText": "I submitted my application to KCL's Applied Mathematics with Theoretical Physics PhD program on November 21st and I have yet to receive an offer or rejection. I asked the faculty on King's Apply last week if they had any updates, and their response was \"Sorry for the long wait, but we are still reviewing your application and will let you know soon.\" Normally, I'd take that at face value, but given that it's been almost 7 months since I applied, and nearly 5 months since the deadline (for a funded studentship, no less), it seems unlikely that they'd still be reviewing my application. Has anyone else who applied to the Applied Maths program received a decision yet? If so, when did you receive it?\n\nUpdate: I received a decision today: It was a no.",

However, when I messaged them on Kingsapply and told them I need a decision bc im considering other offers, I only got a reply that my application is with a tutor who will make the decision soon.

As an international student from the US, my current apartment lease expires in August, and I really need a decision so that I can figure out where to live and reserve a studio before they're all taken. I told KCL that, and they just said \"We'll get it to you as quickly as we can. Do you have an updated transcript from your MSc so we can skim your most recent grades?\" I don't, since my Spring term grades are published on July 12th, so I told them \"I get my grades July 12th, but I will happily get you that transcript then, if that's okay.\" No response, and no contact since. They haven't even told me whether July 12th is fine or whether the application was with my tutor or central admissions. I know if the application got to the tutor that it would be a definite yes because the professor I asked to work with said \"Yes, I will work with you, and yes, it is funded.\" It's super frustrating.",

I have a thesis to write, but I really need to know where I'm living in two months. I live in Brighton at the moment, and I love it here, so I'd like to stay. If I get into KCL, I can stay here and just commute. But I also applied to Swansea and Liverpool, and those are 5 hours away by train. I need to know in advance so I can plan a move if necessary. I still have 4 universities that haven't given me a decision yet. I'm doomed.  \n\n\nWhat program did you apply for?",

The majority of truly private off-campus apartments are just rooms people are renting out their houses, and I don't trust that. If you're fine with living with strangers, there are a bunch of options. Take a look through Rightmove: [https://www.rightmove.co.uk/](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/).\n\nFor KCL specifically, you have places like Chapter Living ([https://www.chapter-living.com/](https://www.chapter-living.com/)), iQ Bankside ([https://www.iqstudentaccommodation.com/london/bankside](https://www.iqstudentaccommodation.com/london/bankside)), and Urbanest ([https://uk.urbanest.com/partners/kcl/](https://uk.urbanest.com/)).\n\nBe warned that living in London is really, really expensive -- like 2-3K a month. That's why I said if I get accepted to KCL that I would stay in Brighton and just commute. Brighton is pretty expensive too, but I've found it affordable. I pay about $1300 a month for my own studio. Getting from Brighton to KCL is a fairly easy task. Go to Brighton Station and get on the Thameslink to London Bridge. It takes 75 minutes, and it's exponentially cheaper than living in London, especially if you get a railcard.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is cities in the UK are small. You can walk most places. I can walk from my apartment to Brighton Beach in 30 minutes. London is, likewise, a walkable city. If you live around the River Thames on South Bank or near Buckingham Palace, the walk is doable without needing to waste money on buses.",

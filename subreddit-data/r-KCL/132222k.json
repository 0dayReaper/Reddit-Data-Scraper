    "postText": "Hello, I received an offer for General Engineering and the conditions are 14/20 in Math and 15/20 overall on my baccalaureate ( I am in the french baccalaureate); 14/20 is equal to A and 16/20 to A*; I have achieved a grade of 19/20 in Math so basically A* but I am a bit worried because of the second condition (we take philosophy and french literature); my question is: having exceeded the first condition by a lot will they be more lenient when it comes to the general overall? So its basically as if I am asking if they asked for an AA but I got A*B; is it the same thing?",

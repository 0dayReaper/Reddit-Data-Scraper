    "postText": "So I\u2019m an international student who will be studying at King\u2019s this coming Autumn and I\u2019ll be there on an exchange for the first semester. I was unable to secure a spot in residence so I\u2019m anxious about what my options will be when it comes to housing in London.\n\nThe housing portal advises you to check regularly for any openings or cancellations, but I was wondering if there was a way to be notified should a space open up? I read that once you register, you are automatically added to a wait list but will they contact you if something comes up? If anyone has had experience in this area it would be greatly appreciated! Or if you have any general advice for finding housing as a student or any good sources you know, I would be glad to hear them.\n\nI\u2019m very excited (but also worried) by the prospect of studying there, so finding more information on residency would be a great help!",

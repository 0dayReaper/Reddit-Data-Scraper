    "postText": "Hello, I am a current postgrad offer holder (international) for King's and I was hoping to get some insight on what the university is like from current students and alumni. The programme is Climate Change: Environment, Science and Policy for KCL, so any comments (or DMs if preferred) from people who were in that programme would be great! I've been contacting alumni on LinkedIn but figured making a post here would be good too.\n\nMy main uncertainty with King's is about how good it actually is within my area of interest, as it doesn't seem to be rated very highly in the environmental studies rankings by QS and Leeds (my other UK offer) is ahead of it in the Guardian and the CUG. I know it has a generally good reputation at least abroad, but I've also seen lots of posts about poor student satisfaction and a bad administration, plus it lags behind Leeds in UK rankings both overall and in my general field (particularly in graduate prospects). However, I would assume that King's probably has a stronger career centre and alumni network, which would be more useful if true for getting the most out of my Masters.\n\nCurrently I'm leaning more towards Leeds at the moment mostly because it's a fair bit cheaper but also because King's have been very poor in responding to my questions about the programme. At the moment King's doesn't even have a description for a lot of the optional courses I'd have to choose from, let alone an actual complete list for me to see. I've contacted them about it a while ago but still waiting to hear back, and I want to make a decision this week because I have a deadline for another university elsewhere soon, so I might just have to reject them by default if I don't hear back in time.\n\nThanks for any responses!",

            "comment": "My understanding is that it is because the KCL Business School is still very new. But read that they appointed excellent professors over the last few years and their A&amp;F course is also the most forward looking course as they bring in the tech angle, whereas most other well rated universities for A&amp;F still has a very traditional A&amp;F course. They also have the biggest Business Club in London and the society organise many co-events with Oxford, Warwick, LSE etc. Excellent networking opp in London and very good Intnl rep. So dint think you can go wrong",

    "postText": "Good morning/afternoon/evening (depending on your time zone)\n\nI am international student who was recently accepted by *KCL* into the postgraduate programme of my choice (Digital Humanities). Since it happens to be my top school, I look forward to moving to London this fall.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't know anyone there. Are any of you on the same boat? (I'm based in Dubai). If you are, would you like to be friends so we can navigate things together?\n\nCheers,\n*Anxious 20-something*",

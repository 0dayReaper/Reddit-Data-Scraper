    "postText": "I will be applying to universities this year and one of my favorites universities is Kings College London. At the moment, I am studying at a college at BTEC Level 3 in IT (Year 1) and, before enrolling in this course, I checked all the entry requirements and understood that after graduating from college, I could enter this university. However, this year the university set new requirements, and now three Ds are not enough for me to enter the university for the Computer Science BSc course. In addition to this, I also need A-Level mathematics. I am not a native British. I moved to London at the age of 16 and, if I had the opportunity, I would go to A-level. But I did not have such an opportunity at that time since I did not know English (especially academic).\n\nBut I am well versed in mathematics. I never had any difficulties with it. I would like to know if there is any Mathematical Admission Test at King's College London, with the help of which I could prove that I have all the knowledge necessary for admission? Only the lack of A-level prevents me from going to university because I get a D grade for all other subjects in college.",

We\u2019re not really qualified to help you to be honest. Then you\u2019ll get the answer from the horse\u2019s mouth - note down who you\u2019re talking to, or ask if you can \u201cget it confirmed in a follow up email\u201d so you have an email trail. \n\nBut ask the uni\u2019. Not a subreddit.",

    "postText": "I'm an American, a few months into the MSc in Applied Neuroscience, and I'd like to get some school swag to rep KCL on the rowdy side of the pond. However, a fair amount of items in the online store are sold out. Specifically, I want to get the black and gold hoodie (limited edition, will there be more?): https://www.kclsu.org/shop/product/10120550/ and the sage green sweater: https://www.kclsu.org/shop/product/10141150/ . \n\nAnyone have any idea when they'll be restocked? You'd think because it's online they'd have set up a print to order system by now...\n\nAny insights would be appreciated.",

This will not be restocked until next September now!",

    "postText": "Hi Everyone!\n\nI'll be joining KCL for an MSc. in AI this coming September. I'll be creating a WhatsApp group for Postgraduate students (although if you are an undergraduate and would like to join, please do not hesitate to ask to be added) with the intention that it would make the transition for overseas students easier and allow everyone to make friends, and benefit from experiences of seasoned students as well!\n\nIf you would like to join the group, please DM me your WhatsApp number, your name and your major, if the requests to join the group becomes overwhelming, I'll edit the post and add the invite link here.\n\nLooking forward to meeting everyone!",

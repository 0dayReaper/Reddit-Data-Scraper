    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\n\nI am a Belgian Law student and I'll be doing the intellectual property LLM starting September this year. I was wondering whether anyone could recommend a certain uni residence. I've been told I'll be spending most of my time at the Strand campus which makes the most obvious choices Stamford Street, Great Dover Street, Moonraker Point, Wolfson, Orchard Lisle and Iris Brook. I was hoping someone could share some of their experience with either of these residences or maybe suggest an alternative.\n\n\nThanks in advance!",

The application process is a pain, though. I stopped mine as soon as I got housing elswhere. ",

Yeah, that scared me a bit too, but from what I ubderstand, there are a lot of accommodation reserved for postgrads. If so, it won't really matter when the applications opens, as long as you apply when they do. ",

            "comment": "I'm a first year (medic, so not strand campus) currently at Great Dover Street. GDS is quite good for the strand students, but you have to swipe in like 3 times to get to your room and the reception staff &amp; security are a total ball-ache to deal with.\n\nIf you can afford it go Moonraker Point. It's closer to strand (but still close enough to Guy's to go to Guy's Bar) and the rooms are larger/more modern.\n\nI don't know much about Stanford Street, but it's so close to the strand campus which must be a bonus. Wolfson is very cheap, a bit grotty, and close enough to strand.\n\nSocially I'd avoid Orchard Lisle and Iris Brook because they're really small.",

It was a nice mix and I\u2019m pretty sure there were almost as many from KCL as there were from UCL \u2014 those two groups were the largest. Next biggest group was LSE, then probably SOAS or RVC, then smaller groups from other colleges. I\u2019d defo recommend: it was really cool to have such a wide group of people in addition to your specific college. Also, being in a catered hall was convenient for 1st year! I had friends in other intercollegiate halls and, from what I remember, their experiences were similar.",

Definitely recommend it! \n\nIt's very international, has a lot of people from different backgrounds and study areas. Being catered and eating breakfast and dinner with everyone certainly was the best way to meet people and make friends (although the food wasn't great at all). \n\nAnd no, although some intercollegiate halls like Connaught Hall have more people from UCL, it is not the case of all intercollegiate halls. International hall for example had pretty much the same number of people from UCL than KCL and quite a few from LSE as well. When you'll get there, you'll realize that all these unis are very similar anyways and there is no point in trying harder to be friends with people from KCL than other unis.",

    "postText": "Hello, I am a junior who is currently studying in the US. I have a 1450 SAT score, 3.3 GPA and I am taking AP Calc BC, Computer Science A AP, and CS Principles. Next year I am planning to take Ap World Hist, Ap Stats, AP Environmental science. If I get a score of 5 at least from 3 of these AP's, would that be good enough to get into KCL, CS major?",

Like, I wouldn\u2019t be too worried about the GPA, they mainly focus on test scores. I think the combo of your SAT (which surpasses the condition requirement) and the 3 APs should be enough. I know a kid from my school who got into King\u2019s with a 2.9 GPA. They\u2019re desperate for international students.",

    "postText": "I run an online music magazine by the name of Vanguard Online (www.vanguard-online.co.uk).\n\nThe site has traditionally been run on a voluntary basis by students, though its open to everyone.\n\nWe're currently seeking new writers to our existing team, and in particular writers from London.\n\nWe get plenty of opportunities to review gigs in London.\n\nThere are also plenty of opportunities to review albums and there are opportunities to conduct interviews with musicians too.\n\nMost of what we get to do is small scale, offbeat bands, some up and coming, with the occasional big gig thrown in here and there.\n\nIf you'd be interested in joining in and giving it a go, you'd be welcome, no experience necessary, just a certain amount of enthusiasm for music and primary school level English.\n\nResidence in the UK or Ireland is helpful for the gigs, but these days you can review albums and conduct interviews from anywhere in the world!\n\nEmail me at vanguardonline@hotmail.com and join us!\n\nMike",

    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019m a first year king\u2019s student, studying history and French! I will no longer need this accommodation and I\u2019m looking to pass on the lease (sept 2022 - June 2023, can be extended directly with the property) for my premium studio apartment at the stayclub residence Camden. Located next to the tube and minutes from central London, this premium studio is perfect for a student or young professional. \n\nI booked early and was able to select a well positioned studio facing the inner courtyard so it\u2019s nice and quiet. It is fully furnished with a double bed and an additional bed that can be stowed away for when you have visitors. It also has a desk and chair for studies, a fully equipped kitchenette, bathroom, and plenty of hidden storage. Bed linen, towels, starter kitchenware, and unlimited WiFi are supplied at no extra cost which is super convenient. \n\nThe property \nThe property has lots of amenities including 24-hour security and a reception, bike storage, a caf\u00e9, a lounge for study or socializing, and a gym.\n\n\u00a3xxx per week includes everything you could possibly need for a great London experience!\n\nDM if interested , I have linked the accommodation below\n[student accommodation](https://www.thestayclub.com)",

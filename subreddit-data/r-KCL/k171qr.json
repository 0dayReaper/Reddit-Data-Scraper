If you have a good GRE score I don\u2019t think submitting it would harm your chances but I think focusing on writing a good personal statement would be more advantageous! However, my MSc is in the Global Health and Social Science dept so your situation might be different to mine. My advice is if they explicitly say they don\u2019t require a GRE score there\u2019s a high chance they won\u2019t even base their decision on your score so focus on making the documents they require as good as you can because they will definitely use those to decide if they\u2019re offering you a place! I would recommend taking the advice of someone who has experience with the department you\u2019re applying to over mine though haha :)",

    "postText": "I just received my offer as an American student. KCL is one of my top choices (International Relations student).  I am interested in a vibrant social life, so should I arrange to live in a hall for KCL students? What are the halls like? If I prefer to live in my own apartment, will this be a detriment to me socially? I realize it's quite early to ask all this but I like to be prepared.\n\nAlso, is KCL a good choice of uni? Is it well regarded in IR? \n\nThanks!",

I\u2019ll be going with King\u2019s Accom, we\u2019ll have similar lectures/areas of study, so let me know if you ever want to link up.",

    "postText": "I have an offer from KCL that i\u2019ve been given 1 month to respond to. I\u2019m also on a reserve list for LSE, and have been given no time stamp other than \u201cBefore August 19th\u201d. I prefer the modules in the latter, and am optimistic because a majority of reserve list holders from my course received an offer. \n\nCan KCL extend my offer past 1 month? I\u2019ve already sent them an email asking to do so but they haven\u2019t responded.",

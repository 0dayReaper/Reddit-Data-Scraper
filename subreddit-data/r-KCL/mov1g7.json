However, I do know people that also tried to switch later on and didn't manage to. I don't think that it jeopardises your current offer, if they say you can't switch, I'm sure you will just continue with the course you originally applied for.",

But it did take some time before they fully confirmed my course change (they weren't the fastest at replying). I did message them through King's Apply and they also replied through it as well. And no, I did not have to write a lot for it, I just basically asked them if I could change course and they said yes.",

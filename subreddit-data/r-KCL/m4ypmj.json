    "postText": "Hi everybody, I am applying to the MA Strategic Communications at the War Studies department, but due to the obvious difficulty of getting accepted at KCL, I intend to apply to similar courses at other universities. Therefore I was wondering whether anyone knew of comparable courses in Europe, that is, Strategic Communications courses with a focus on International Relations. There appear to be plenty of these courses focusing on business, marketing, ect. but few to none concerning IR. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

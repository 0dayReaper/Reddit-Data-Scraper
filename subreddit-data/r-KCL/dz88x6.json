    "postText": "Hello, \n\nI am an American student coming from California, on an exchange program. I was emailed about the accommodation application being open on Friday, so I applied then. However, I contacted the residences office, and they informed me that I needed to update the application since it went live on the 18th (Monday). I did that last night, but I was also informed I will hear back within six weeks, which is right before my arrival. Does anyone know when the uni will offer accommodations?",

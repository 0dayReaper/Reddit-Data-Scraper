(Grades, work experience, etc)\n\nI know in the US it\u2019s a huge deal to be involved in extra-curricular activities to be considered for admission at schools\u2014 is this the case for King\u2019s too?\n\nThanks in advance!!",

Same for the specifics of the program e.g whether it involves work placements.",

They'll list the minimum requirements regarding GPA and other materials. Make sure you familiarize yourself with what they're looking for in a personal statement, it's not like the US undergrad where you can write about pretty much anything. It should be directly tailored to your prospective course and school. I had all of my extracurriculars on my CV, but I only talked about the relevant ones in my personal statement.\n\nThe international students application and the domestic students application process is pretty much identical, except you'll have to fill out some extra information regarding visas. \n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any other questions.",

    "postText": "Hi all Kings! know that Leiden is not a topic you would generally discuss. But im hoping someone here has some insight to help with my confusion. \n\nI got admits to both these places for MSc in Artificial Intelligence starting Sept, 2020. I would just want to know if anyone has any advice on what to choose and why?\n\nThese are my concerns: \n\u2022 Leiden\u2019s course is 2 years. So I feel it\u2019ll be more in depth and I\u2019ll learn at a reasonable pace. KCL is a 1 year course so it might be too fast paced n idk if I can get a thesis out in a year\u2019s time. \n\u2022 KCL is a huge name and branding does go a long way. But I don\u2019t hear anything bad about Leiden either. Both have great connections in their respective regions. KCL is too 5 in UK. Leiden is top 5 in Netherlands. But KCL is rank 37 and Leiden is 67 and that\u2019s why I\u2019m v confused. \n\u2022 Costs. How much does it cost to live in London? I know it\u2019s more expensive but I would appreciate any ballpark figures thrown at me. Just so I have a clue. The tuition fee alone is almost double compared to Leiden\u2019s 1 year fee. So I would like to know if there are other costs I should keep in mind..like how much does food cost and so on. \n\u2022 BREXIT - what does this mean for the IT industry (including start ups) in London? What\u2019s an average salary of an AI Masters / MSc Comp student? I know that Leiden would get you around 50,000-80,000\u20ac average per annum. \n\nI do see after typing all this out that Leiden has more pros. But the rank thing is killing me. I\u2019m sure some of you have faced this issue before. Please help me sort this one out!",

You could always go work in the Netherlands if you wanted to, but London is a far more international. Both sound great, I'd study in London but I'm obviously bias. Also if you're done in a year you can start working sooner. I don't entirely know the impact Brexit has had on these things, but I wouldn't worry about it.\n\nI personally have never heard of Leiden and if name recognition is what you want, London is the obvious choice.",

But rn because of the BREXIT thing I\u2019ll need another round of visa for it. \n\n&gt; If you\u2019re done in a year you can start working sooner. \n\nThat\u2019s v true. But I feel it\u2019ll be so hard to find time to do everything I wanted to in a 1 years masters course including wrecking my brains on what to do a thesis in.",

            "comment": "Coming from a BSc in Computer Science in KCL and living in London for 5+ years. I've had some interactions with AI courses but don't take my opinion for an expert one. I don't know anything about Leiden either. Just trying my best to give my opinion on KCL and living in London to help you get to the best decision.\n\nIn terms of the UK, KCL is definitely a big and recognised academical name.\n\nIf you're looking to go into industry as fast as possible then one year course should be good enough. I don't believe you will really have any gaps in your knowledge, neither I believe you will have bigger issues to be able to cope with your thesis for the same time frame\n\nAverage starting salary in London can be similar, tho I can imagine in London you will have way more opportunities compared to what you put as expected in Leiden. Tho if you don't want to necessarily have your career in London then it might be a smaller factor.\n\nLiving in London as a student has a huge monetary cost. Rent and transport costs are high.\n\nAbout Brexit. Hope someone can give better answer than me. I've been privileged enough to be a long time in the UK to not have to worry about that. Not sure if relevant but international people who need a visa to work here in the company I work for usually get their visa funded but they have to stay  for a minimum amount of time (1 or 2 years usually).\n\nAs a whole if you see yourself want to work in an industry in London after you graduate, and also be able to take the hit on the living costs, then I would recommend KCL. This is coming also from no idea about the situation in Leiden",

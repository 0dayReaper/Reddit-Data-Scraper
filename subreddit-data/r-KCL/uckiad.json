    "postText": "Hello \n\nI recently got an offer from KCL for Bsc Economics. In my offer letter, it is stated that \" Your place is fully funded, and you are not required to make any payments for this module.\" Could someone please clarify about what this actually means? Does this mean that I have received a full scholarship or is this some sort of generic line? Also, if you are a Bsc Economics student at KCL, how has your experience been so far in terms of academics, internships and social life? Thanks a lot!!",

They\u2019ll be able to answer appropriately and accurately without speculation - plus you\u2019ll have it in writing - which is what most answers you\u2019ll get here will be. \n\nIf you just assume or get info from people who have no authority on the matter, you run getting complacent and possibly missing a payment if you have to make it because you thought you didn\u2019t. If that makes sense. \n\nTL;DR just ask the uni. You\u2019ll get a more reliable answer.",

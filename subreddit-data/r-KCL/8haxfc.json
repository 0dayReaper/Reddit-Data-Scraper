    "postText": "hello!\n  \n\ni'm an american student and i initially applied last year to pursue political science. i received an unconditional acceptance and chose not to go because i feared that it might hurt my chances running for office in the states if i went to college internationally. now, i hate my current college (northeastern university) and i hate political science. i want to study film at kcl, but fear that i will be at a disadvantage because i'm reapplying after refusing the first offer.\n  \nwhat do you think? i have a 3.83 college gpa (A, A, B+, B+ first semester, then A A A A second semester), a 1480 SAT, two 5s on the AP exams (US history + english literature), two 4s (microeconomics and macroeconomics), a 3 (physics 1), and two 2s (spanish lang + calc ab). i also have a 770 on the literature SAT II, 660 on math 1, and 630 on the US history one (weird since i did well on the AP, but yeah).\n  \ncan i still get in for the fall?",

They are for anyone in ULU universities- which includes kings.\n\nThere\u2019s a few in Holborn area which are ideal to walk to strand campus. Such as one in Tavistock square.\n\nAlso more fun as you have people from all different unis in one halls so get to meet so many more people from different areas and so going out is way more fun, as you go to all different uni nights out from meeting various ppl",

If that price range is good for u than I suggest to look at intercollegiate halls as they may be closer to strand.",

But if you wanna be close to Strand it\u2019s probably not a good choice since it\u2019s a couple of miles further than the other accommodations\u2026",

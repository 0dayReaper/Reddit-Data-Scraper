With the deadline to apply for accommodation at Kings being the 17th and it taking 48 hours after confirming my decision, that means I have 1 day to confirm my admission.\n\nThis deadline seems ridiculously too soon especially considering how everything is delayed with COVID. I was wondering if anyone is familiar with the accommodation process and if there is normally sufficient spaces available (in my case, Stamford Street) after the deadline, or if it is normally a lost cause not grabbing guaranteed placement by that date?",

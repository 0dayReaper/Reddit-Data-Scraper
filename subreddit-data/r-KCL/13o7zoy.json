    "postText": "Hi, I'm about to choose between Biochemistry course at QMUL and KCL. I am coming to London this week to check out King's College. I already saw QMUL at Offer Holders Day and was quite impressed, but I didn't have a chance to see KCL since I haven't got the offer from them at the time. I will be having a tour at Guy's campus but I would really like to meet somebody studying there who's willing to talk about their experience at KCL.",

The online master's seems like a good opportunity but I'm not sure if I'll get the same knowledge/experience out of it ? \n\nThanks :)",

A big part of an educational experience is the community and the in-person meetings. I don\u2019t think an online MA can match those experiences but that is just my own two cents. And an MA in international relations might lead you to a new job\u2026 feel free to send me a message if you need to talk about this more!",

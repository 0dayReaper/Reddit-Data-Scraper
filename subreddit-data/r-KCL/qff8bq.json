    "postText": "Hi\n\nI'm currently in the process of applying to UCAS for PPE and I'm wondering if KCL is a good option for me. Of course the uni has great prestige and is a hotspot for opportunities but would you say the PPE (Politics, Philosophy and Economics) at KCL is well-known? If anybody could offer insights into the quality of the lectures, research opportunities, professors etc that would be greatly appreciated :) ",

    "postText": "Hi! Has anyone stayed a Canada Water, I'm planning on booking here for my accommodation and was wondering if there are any major problems that I should be aware of and what the vibe is like. Also, I wanna try to get a room with a window facing the street so if anyone can give me any idea on how the room/flat numbers relate to where the rooms face that would be sweet. Thanks!!",

Good area with everything us students could need. 5 mins from bus, tube, library and shopping centre. Took about 30 mins to commute to strand campus by bus when I went for the open day. Only bad thing I can think of is that it\u2019s right next to a primary school and nursery so might be distracting depending upon your room placement. But all in all would definitely choose that accommodation \ud83d\udc4d",

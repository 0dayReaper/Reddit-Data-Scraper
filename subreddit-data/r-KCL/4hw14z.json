    "postText": "So I remember reading that you could have ~~a top 5 list of choices~~ and that King's would try to fit you in at least one of your choices.\n\nI've just applied and there was zero choice and pretty limited options. I wanted to room at Connaught but was pretty willing to go to one of the other two intercollegiate houses. Now it looks like that there's a significant chance I won't be placed in any of them.\n\nEdit: Can't find where I read that now. Also \"students program placement is not taken into account.\" &lt;- WHAT?! So in other words I can get placed in freaking Champion Hill and have to trek like 30 minutes on public transport (yet another expense), brilliant...\n\nFeeling pretty pissed off at the moment and discouraged. I had my heart set on connaught too.",

I made more friends living about half an hour away than I would've if I'd lived close.\nTravel costs a lot - I'll admit - but if you live in zone 2 you can get a travel card (on an 18+ oyster) for ~\u00a380 a month which you'll end up using much more than you think and it will ~~probably~~ definitely save you money in the long run.\nAlso, in my opinion, it's better to live somewhere else as you want to experience London not just KCL.",

Even if it's just giving us more than one option for allocation once they've randomly decided. \n\nEven their videos discuss choices and invite you to visit the houses. What's the point of visiting a dorm if you're likely not to get it anyway? \n\nPerhaps it's just because where I live now, you've got complete control over your housing options. Random selection just isn't done. ",

I actually liked being a little further out because it gave me a chance to explore a different part of the city. \n\nAs for the cost,  I think the halls are mostly all in zones 1&amp;2. Mine was still in zone one and you can get a student oyster/travel card as well which actually gives a nice discount. ",

    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nWe are recent graduates who launched a community learning platform ([https://prepaired.eu/](https://prepaired.eu/)) for King's College, UCL and LSE students. We know it must be weird mostly meeting your peers in Zoom lectures.\n\nOn the platform, you can create live audio-rooms organized around interesting topics/studying (e.g.: US elections, chemistry exam preparation). You can browse these rooms on the site and join the best for you. Basically, it helps you connect and get to know like-minded peers even when you can't meet on campus.\n\nIt is completely free, there is no premium subscription or ads. It would be amazing if you could try out the platform and give some feedback on how we could improve it to help you the most.\n\nThank you for your feedback in advance!\n\nIf you have any questions just PM me:)",

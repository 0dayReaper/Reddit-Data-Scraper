    "postText": "Hi - I hope you\u2019re well. Just got off the phone with an advisor and told me about their 100% online program of Masters in International Relations and said the degree is 100% the same as someone going there in person and that the credentials are the same as well. Can someone confirm this?\n\nCan some one who went there also provide information on how the course was and how everything went? Really would love more information.",

            "comment": "I believe (pls correct me if wrong) you might be referring to the online MA in International Affairs (PG Dip PG Cert). Sounds similar to International Relations (IR) but its different.\n\nThe online MA includes some IR but is practically strategic studies. It has 3 primary tracks: Cyber Security Studies, Espionage &amp; Surveillance Studies or Strategic Studies. You can specialise according to your interest/career.\n\nHowever, I shld note that it is definitely not the same credentials as one of the traditional IR MAs by Dept. of War Studies. You would be receiving a postgrad diploma and there's no same degree title offerred in-person.",

The advisor said through it I would get 2 certifications and then at the end my MA. What do you mean by there\u2019s no same degree title offered in person? \n\nThe advisor said it would be a regular diploma like everyone else like a MA in International Affairs. \n\nWhat do you recommend? I\u2019m from the US and there are many colleges here I just assumed this is a good opportunity because this is KCL and a Masters from here would help my background in political science but at the same time didn\u2019t want to get \u201cscammed\u201d getting a MA at the end that said online but he said it wouldn\u2019t say online. \n\nWhat\u2019s the diff between IA and IR though?",

Your degree is not going to say \"Online\".",

    "postText": "Hello, I've applied to the MSc during mid Feb along with references but have not received any answer yet. They did request additional documents last 3 weeks ago and recently my document status has been changed to \"Document is OK\", \"Personal statement meets needs for assessment\" and \"Document is suitable to proceed with assessment; no other academic documents are required\".\n\nI'm looking for people here in the same situation, in order to track response times.\n\nAlso wondering have any of you received any offers yet? How long did they get back to you from the day you applied?\n\nThank you.",

    "postText": "Hi Guys\n\nI was just wondering how difficult it is to be accepted into the M.A of Political Economy. The admission for Australian students is an \"Award of a 4 year Honours Degree/Degree with Honours with Second Class Honours Division A (HIIA/H2A/2A) and an overall average of 70%\" - Is this simply if I average 70% by the time I finish I'll be accepted? Seems like a stupid question but just want to clarify if there was any fine print!",

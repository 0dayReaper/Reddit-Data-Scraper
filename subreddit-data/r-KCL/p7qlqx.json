I literally went to the course events that they held and just got talking to people there and also went to random accommodation events and the KCL freshers events that they put on. Don\u2019t do anything you\u2019re uncomfortable with - i\u2019ve found lots of friends who are likeminded just because i\u2019ve gone to the events that I was comfortable with. My biggest advice is just to put yourself out there and talk to everyone and just attend lots of events. You\u2019ll be fine \ud83d\ude0a",

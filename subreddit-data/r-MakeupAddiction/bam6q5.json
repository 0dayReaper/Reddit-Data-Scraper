Do not use a beauty blender, use a small brush with spare bristles so it doesn\u2019t move the product. \n\nStep 2: Use a medium to high coverage concealer to cover the color difference. (Tarte shape tape, wet and wild photo focus concealer, etc) Use a beauty blender to blend the concealer. \n\nStep 3: Bake your concealer with a loose power(do not use a HD powder). Coty air spun power, on the tip of a beauty blender to set. \n\nIf you\u2019re even darker than my mom i would recommend going to a super red based concealer. Something that looks like terra-cotta, peachy tones stops working after a certain level! ",

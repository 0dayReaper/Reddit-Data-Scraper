I try hard to balance being my kids' friend with being their mom. I figured painting their rooms would make them (and me) happier to spend time in them, so win-win. \n\nTwo, same issue. My stepdad is one of those, \"neutral colors only, we have to think of maintenance, upkeep, resale value, blah blah blah,\" people. (At least, he is with me, and I'm the eldest. Double no-nonsense whammy.) I cannot stand neutral colors (outside of makeup) as a result.\n\nThree, as a mom who also happens to be a straight-passing queer chick, all I can say is I'm sorry if the relationship you have with your family is such that you're afraid to come out. I understand that notion COMPLETELY, especially having grown up in a military family with ties to the Deep South. If it doesn't weird you out, I extend the following  offer: you're welcome to be a part of my tribe any time. (The mom hugs and chocolate chip cookies are complimentary. \ud83d\udc9c)",

I hope you can feel true in yourself with your family, but regardless of your situation with them, being a queer person can be such a blessing.

For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m currently hooked on the Making Gay History podcast; there\u2019s nothing like hearing the people behind the movements that gave us voices speak for themselves.",

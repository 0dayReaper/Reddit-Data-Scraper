She had all those products, too, but in case of the lipstick it was a really good advise, so I could reapply during the day. Usually they are there to make it your day, so using the makeup you feel comfortable with is not a big deal.\n\nBut it is also all about talking and listening to their experience. She was using some foundation that lasted all day, but honestly was out of my price range (and I think it is not even available in my country). My foundation lasts ok-ish, so I was really happy about the better option. We also did a trial make up a few months in advance, so I could see if the make up would break me out or not (and of course to see if her style was what I was looking for).",

There were some adjustments that needed to be made and they got it done by the next morning (cutting it super close I know). \nRecommendations:\n1. BARGAIN BARGAIN BARGAIN... they initially gave me $700 as the price for this dress which he eventually brought down to $500\n2. Do NOT give them full payment until alterations are made \n3. Tell them if they don\u2019t have it to you by day xx then they will be responsible to ship it to you\n4. Most places in India now use credit cards, try to utilize that. If they screw you over, don\u2019t give you what was promised confirm whether you can charge back\n5. Shopping days will be rough, start early and stay hydrated!! \n\nGood luck girly",

This past year the 500 point rewards ($500) have been what you used to get for 100 five years ago. This year and the ~NEW~ system is even *worse*.\n\nI prefer Sephora as a brick and mortar experience. Something about the stores, even the big tourist-sized ones, helps with my adhd while Ulta seems to aggravate it. However, their rewards are much better (if ordering direct from the manufacturer doesn\u2019t get me a better deal, I just ordered $200 worth of nail polish for $70 because they were clearing out some old colors).",

That\u2019s where the make overs and \u2018samples\u2019 (they used to put it on for you) and the pretty packaging with tissue paper came from. Even the \u2018rewards\u2019 started as holiday cards then gifts given at the end of the year to \u2018valued\u2019 customers.\n\nIt was a sign of luxury for years and that was worth the markup for a lot of people. But they\u2019ve kept the higher prices and dropped the \u2018above and beyond\u2019 type of services you used to get in exchange. \n\nThat was the last straw for me. I shop at Ulta anyways for hair products and they carry most of my favorite brands. And their online shopping has always been very good, it just doesn\u2019t come in a fancy box. What they don\u2019t carry are the luxury brands I splurge on and those companies\u2019 shipping and customer service are just as good if not better than what Sephora used to be.",

What's different is that with Ulta, their points reward you with an actual discount in dollars. And the money increases a lot the more you make:\n100 points= $3; \n300 points= $9; \n500 points= $17.50; \n1000 points= $50; \n2000 points= $125, the most you can get from your points. This is why many people who shop at Ulta wait until they have 2000 points to cash in. Especially when there are sales or when they give a \"20% on all, including prestige\" coupon.\n\nWhat truly makes this better than Sephora's is that Ulta gives points multipliers for certain products or for all purchases every month. Not lying, you will get some type or point multiplier deal from Ulta every month. So if you take advantage, you can get 2000 points in a few months. I've redeemed $2000 points 3x since January for a total of $375 while getting discounted stuff and huge sample bags. It's pretty amazing.",

BUT they still have multipliers and they have them often and on common products (Sephora only used to do 2x pts days during holidays only, or online when they were pushing their online store). Their tiers are also at much lower levels. I think VIB Rouge is now at 1500pts ($1500 pre tax in one calendar year since there are no more multiplier days) when it first started out at 800.\n\nI don\u2019t know the exact numbers but basically Ulta gives the same benefits at lesser amounts (even Rouge members pay for the services now, just using points instead of cash like the plebs), and because of the many events they run year round, those tiers are easier and cheaper to reach. Ulta\u2019s support is really good. If you wanted it from the source, then they would definitely tell you in straight language about it. I only watched a comparison video on YouTube when Sephora sent me an email about changing their tiers.",

Additionally, if you are a full time worker  who's hours were cut below 32 hours, you can also file for unemployment to get paid for the difference (still at the 50% rate, but not nothing). Granted those who were cut from Sephora were part time, so I don't think that last point is quite valid to this conversation. \n\nI say this as someone who was recently at risk of lay off and instead had my hours cut to 20/week instead. I'm so grateful to have at least part of a job. Both for the money and for the sanity of a routine.",

No straight answer on if there would be rehiring at the end of this. Before you dive in to the thread, please note that OP and other employees seem more upset by the three minute phone call. (Also found another thread on r-sephora, which has more employee reactions.)\n\nWith the way this depression might turn out, i sincerely doubt that staffing levels will return to pre-covid19 levels.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/fslv2j/sephora\\_usa\\_just\\_massfired\\_all\\_parttime\\_employees/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/fslv2j/sephora_usa_just_massfired_all_parttime_employees/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Sephora/comments/fsklnl/sephora\\_officially\\_decides\\_to\\_lay\\_off\\_all/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sephora/comments/fsklnl/sephora_officially_decides_to_lay_off_all/)\n\nedit: bc there is a chance people won't go through that thread here are some highlights:  \n\n\n\" Absolutely true. It happened through a conference call and they  basically told us we\u2019ve been laid off. We were muted so we weren\u2019t even  allowed to ask questions and at the end the person who called us  (district manager) just thanked us for our work and hung up. We were  promised through an email sent about a week ago that they\u2019d take care of  their employees but obviously they put their multi billion dollar  business before their hard working employees. \"  \n\n\n\" It wasn\u2019t just holiday (employees). Myself and two other girls had been there over 2 years and we got laid off.\"  \n\n\n\"I honestly cried the second I heard  it on the call. I was seasonal this past holiday season and transferred  stores last month to become core and I was so excited! I was so excited  about the little things- to get the striped t shirt, gratis, get a name  tag. I finally felt like part of the team and loved all of my coworkers.\n\nToday  felt like a slap in the face. They gave us 20 min notice and fired us  all on zoom. They promised to take care of us and our families during  this time and now this. Its baffling to me. They\u2019re a multi billion  dollar company who claims to care for its employees as family. I  couldn\u2019t stop crying for an hour honestly. I\u2019ve waited so long to work  at sephora and I finally got my dream job. It hurts so much. My dad  keeps telling me \u201cit\u2019s just business\u201d but literally fuck that.\"  \n\n\n \"What pisses me off about this whole  thing is how they did it. They did one big massive conference call while  everyone was on the phone from the district and had everyone check in,  in front of everyone else. It ended up being about 100 people on my call  that got laid off.\n\nAnother thing  that pisses me off is that they told us they would keep paying us for 6  weeks and then reevaluate everything, it\u2019s barely been 2 before they  started laying people off. I get that they had to do it, but they way  they did it rubs me the wrong way.\"  \n\n\n\" This is so sad. I worked part time at Sephora and we were always treated  way worse than the full time employees. I had to work 39.5 hours a week  and when I asked to be moved to full time so I could have medical  benefits, they told me no. Which was why I quit. I worked 30 minutes  less than full time, but was denied all perks for basically working just  as much. I\u2019m so sorry to anyone who lost their job because of this.  This is such a tragedy. Stay strong guys! You\u2019ll get through this!!! \"",

They get severance which is usually for part-time employees to begin with, and now allows them to apply for government aid. Some people might be getting more money this way, especially if they were part-time to begin with. \n\nI\u2019m not a huge fan of sephora in general but I think people are blowing this out of proportion. They can\u2019t keep everyone so they\u2019re trying to prioritize their long-term employees (none of which they\u2019ve let go to my knowledge). And yes, they are a billion-dollar company but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have million-dollar debts.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t seem like an unreasonable move like Jeff Bezos asking for donations to pay his workers.

Most companies would not have given severance or aid in finding a new job. \n\nI understand people hate big corporations because of the money they make, but they use that money for expenses, a lot of it being employees. So if we collectively stop shopping at Sephora, they'll have to lay off way more people than they already have.",

If they are able to collect unemployment, it\u2019s probably not much. I have been laid off before during a recession and my weekly benefit barely paid a fraction of my bills. Let\u2019s acknowledge unemployment is not a sole solution for people struggling to pay rent/mortgages and buy food right now. \n\n2. This is unprecedented. No company has a guide or instruction manual for this type of situation, however I still hold large corporations to higher standards. At the very least they could have shown some respect to these employees than just a 3 minute conference call. Also, didn\u2019t Sephora send out an email a couple weeks ago about how they would still be paying their employees? If that\u2019s the case they should be transparent about that. Either own your shit or stick to your word. \n\n3. Severance pay for these employees was probably minimal. 2 weeks if that. Severance is typically based on how long you\u2019ve been with the company and in some cases, not required when employees have been laid off.",

I\u2019ve witnessed it myself. I also overheard and employee asking a manager if a lipstick that was just returned looked \u201cgood enough to put back on the shelf.\u201d Don\u2019t buy makeup at an ulta store. \n\nOh and when I ordered a makeup palette from their website the colors were all a bit different looking than on the website and half of them looked like the same color when I swatched them. I\u2019ve never had that happen before and I think it was a fake. I shared the story on a makeup sub here and lots of people shared that they\u2019ve had the same experience when ordering online, that the stuff that shows up is sometimes lower quality.",

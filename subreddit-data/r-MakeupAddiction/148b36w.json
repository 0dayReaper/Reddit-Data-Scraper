    "postText": "I\u2019d consider myself pretty good at doing my makeup except for when it comes to eyeshadow. It\u2019s something i really want to be good at except it looks awful every time i try. Why is that? I\u2019ve watched tons of tutorials, practiced on myself and others , bought decent pallets and brushes and it still never looks right. A tip i hear a lot is i need to be patient and blend more so I\u2019ve done that but nonetheless it still looks messy.",

It\u2019s. always. coming. back. under. my. eyes.\n\nI use the Makeup Forever Aqua Resist eyeliner in black, I have VERY dark brown eyes and think it really brings everything together. I also wear contacts every day and love how it never smudges on my contact lenses. I would love to find a solution for this (if there even is one) \n\nThanks y\u2019all &lt;3",

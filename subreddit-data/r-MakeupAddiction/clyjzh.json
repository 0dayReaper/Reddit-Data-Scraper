I use it to buy things i run out of while I'm in town and then pay it off come payday. I think my balance rn is about $100 from setting spray and some face stuff. I've hit a lull in my purchases because I havent really been \"wowed\" by recent releases, so thankfully my wallet hasn't suffered. It was an impulse to apply for while I was there but I'm glad I did. Not only has it helped my credit score but it also forces me to look at what I'm buying. Me and hubs are trying to buy our house so we're both trying to up our scores, so impulse buys have more consequences for me than just spent money.",

Then just save up your points for samples of things that you either really want to test for a few days and maybe couldn\u2019t (out of stock, a product you cant get an in-store sample of, etc) or something you\u2019re running low on and maybe don\u2019t want to repurchase right away.

I used to save up my points for the 500 pt boxes of products from brands I liked, but now that they have the $100 gift cards, I've been using it for that. I spend almost exactly $1k each year, and with the point rewards for birthdays and rouge renewal I can get a $100 once a year. That's 10% back on my purchases, on top of the fact that I'm buying almost exclusively during the 20% off sales... I think it's a pretty decent sale system if you're careful about how you spend your points.  \n\n\nEven if you just save for the boxes, you get a decent amount of travel sized products. I have a ton of travel sized stuff from Bumble &amp; Bumble and Ouai that I got from the 500 pt boxes.",

Maybe I don\u2019t know heavy makeup wearers but I think that it\u2019s definitely a better idea for a lot of us to just stick to mini-makeup because while you feel like you\u2019re getting a better deal, it\u2019s basically still spending twice as much for the same amount of product because the remainder\u2019s going to go bad anyway..",

The clinique one, bumble &amp; bumble, and ouai were all awesome deals. \n\nI honestly really like the $100 certificate for 2500 pts that they do now. The thing is, if you're rouge you're already getting 1.5x pts, in addition to a point bonus at the start of the year for rouge renewal, and a 750pt birthday gift. You can hit 2500pts in a year spending only the $1k you need to retain rouge status--so essentially, you get 10% back on your purchases. Considering that you also get 20% off everything in store 4x a year, 10% back is pretty good. I try to buy exclusively with Sephora and reserve all my purchases for the 20% off sales, and I feel like I end up saving a ton of money by doing that. There are a couple brands I can't get, such as Paula's Choice, but the savings on things like perfume is absolutely phenomenal.",

I'm in Canada, so sometimes it makes sense to buy the same product at Shoppers Drugs / Pharmaprix as their Optimum points are good. And I got an awesome Elizabeth Arden bag with very decent sized skinscare samples as a promotion  the last time I bought my regular foundation , so sometimes it pays to think beyond Sephora points. However, for products I haven't bought before, it's Sephora all the way due to their return policy.",

So they\u2019ll definitely do it if you have good reason to and maybe if you ask. I was very specifically looking for something mattifying and long lasting and that\u2019s hard to judge unless I went home with it, so it was her who offered to give me a sample of both. But that was definitely the only time it happened, and they obviously wouldn\u2019t do it for stuff like pressed powders and lipsticks but only for foundation, liquid highlight, etc.",

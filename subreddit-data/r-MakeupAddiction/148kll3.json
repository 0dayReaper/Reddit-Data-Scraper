    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI\u2019m wondering if anyone has recommendations for makeup books/resources that focus on specific techniques/technical aspects of makeup application? \n\nI feel like I\u2019ve hit a plateau in skill and while I can follow tutorials well, I have a harder time creating my own looks. I don\u2019t have any background in visual arts outside of makeup, so Im looking for something that can break down the whys and how\u2019s of the different effects that makeup can have. \n\nI\u2019m currently looking into \u201cColour theory for makeup artists\u201d and have purchased \u201cMakeup Masterclass\u201d by Rae Morris. I\u2019m interested in editorial styles, but welcome suggestions for all areas of makeup! \n\nTIA",

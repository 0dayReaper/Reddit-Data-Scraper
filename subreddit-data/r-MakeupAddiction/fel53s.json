I love that others have lifestyles, attitudes, sense of self where they do exactly as they please. Makes me smile and feel joyous everytime. A la BaddieWinkle.\n\nEdit: fake lashes are beautiful.

By the time the weekend rolls around I am working out (hobby). If we go out to diner I will do more. But an art look like this is really out of my comfort zone.

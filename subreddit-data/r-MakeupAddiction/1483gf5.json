I still find it harder to do makeup on myself and still have days where I feel like I do a terrible job at it..",

Also try to make your eyes symmetrical rather than your eyeliner. I m sure you are doing great. Just practice and have fun \ud83d\ude0a",

I feel like the rest of us just do our best and improve along the way. I mastered basic eyeshadow quick but everything else took time and I still can't do a good cat eye eyeliner. It all takes time and practice. We used to practice and do each other's makeup as teenagers but mostly eyeshadow so probably how I learned that quicker. Practice and have fun and never expect perfection in makeup. It doesn't exist",

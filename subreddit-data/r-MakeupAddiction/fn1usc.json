I pat on the shadow onto the lid with a flat brush when the base is still a little tacky. I bring the colour up quite high, and then take a fluffy brush to blend the edges out. It is a gorgeous palette and I'd recommend it for sure, but you will need a primer or concealer to get the most out of it!",

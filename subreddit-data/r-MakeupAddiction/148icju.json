    "postText": "Hi everyone!\nI'm looking for a concealer, and I don't know where to start. I feel like there are no more trustworthy in depth-youtube-videos about makeup anynore. Every tiktok-video feels sponsored.\nSo my question is, could someone recommend me a concealer? My skin is pale, acne-scarred and semi-oily. I also need a little coverage around my eyes, so it needs to work with that also. So i'm looking for something that covers and lasts.\nHere are the ones i've tried so far:\n\nBenefit Bo'oing concealer and\nMac pro longwear concealer dried me out and irritated my eyes badly.\nDior's Forever concealer is too thick and creamy, and creases like crazy no matter what i do.\nAll of the Loreal, Maybelline and Catrice's and Essences concealers, not a single one felt like worth repurchasing.\n\nI've never tried Shape tape, any thoughts on that? I'm also interested in Born this way. \nAll recommendations are more than welcome \ud83d\ude0a",

I've also got the shape tape creamy and that one is also lovely but will crease over time if skin gets oily. In winter it was nice but now in summer I use the original shape tape. \n\nI had the born this way but I found it too drying for the sensitive skin under the eye (I also have oily skin). \n\nAnother nice one is Lanc\u00f4me ultra wear, I have the one that comes in a tube. A little goes a LONG way with that one, it's similar to the Mac pro but a lot smoother, less drying and a lovely invisible skin finish.",

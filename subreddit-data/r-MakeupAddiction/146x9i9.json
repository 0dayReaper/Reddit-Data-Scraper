If you're plucking in the center, you might be slightly overdoing it. If the center tends to look scraggly, this can often be managed with a spoolie and scissors instead. Otherwise I think they look good. \n\nAre your eyebrows raised in the picture? Might be good to see a photo where they're not. If they aren't raised, I think you could flatten out the arch very slightly, but that's just what I prefer on myself. \n\nThese are just serving suggestions, I could be totally wrong and you try it and it looks crazy, so when in doubt my suggestion is science - try some different stuff and see what you think looks best.",

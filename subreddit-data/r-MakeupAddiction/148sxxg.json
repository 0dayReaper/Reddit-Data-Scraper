Among others I'm probably forgetting, I've tried:\n\n* MAC Fluidline\n* Inglot AMC gel eyeliner\n* Urban Decay 24/7 eyeliners\n* Essence eyeliners (various varieties)\n* Maybelline Tattoo Studio gel eyeliner\n* Lancome eye pencil\n\nI've heard great things about the Makeup Forever eyeliners and the Makeup by Mario ones but I'm open to suggestions at this point of eyeliners that stay on the waterline and that don't essentially \"melt\" off.",

    "postText": "I can\u2019t find it anywhere on the website or anywhere else. It\u2019s a really popular color because it\u2019s a dupe of the color a famous singer used as her signature color before she passed( Selena Quintanilla) used I only found ONE listing for the exact shade but it\u2019s  really cheap. Idk if it\u2019s fake and idk where the batch code on an EA lipstick is at so I can\u2019t check on a batch code finder either. Idk if there are EA lipstick counterfeits.  Don\u2019t wanna purchase a fake lipstick that I\u2019ll use on my lips",

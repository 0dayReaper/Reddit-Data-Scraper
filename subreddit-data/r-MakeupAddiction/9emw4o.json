Of course it\u2019s dreamy when you get to work with models that have amazing Cara D level brows, but I actually get quite excited when I have a client with overplucked or sparse brows because it makes for such a visual impact and difference when you hand them the mirror at the end \ud83d\ude0a",

I was working on a big project at the time so I\u2019m so sorry if I didn\u2019t have time to reply to your comments individually, but my Mum and I appreciated and read them all. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m so pleased to see that there seems to be a general desire to see more mature women wearing makeup. \n\nIn response to everyone\u2019s requests, you might be pleased to know that Mum and I are in the process of trying to arrange a day that I can film the makeover process and upload it to YouTube. My schedule is pretty hectic at the moment but I should have a bit of time in mid October so I will keep you all posted! \n\nIn the meantime this is another \u2018mature skin\u2019 makeup (and hair) that I did recently for another client (not my mum just to clarify!) :)\n\nProducts used:\n\nBase:\n\n- Superfacialist Vitamin C Moisturiser \n- Mac Strobe Cream in Peachlite\n- YSL Touch\u00e9 Eclat Foundation B30\n- Recover Cosmetics Concealer in #2 (best concealer EVER for covering redness)\n- La Girl Pro Conceal Peach Corrector\n- Bobbi Brown BBU Palette Concealers\n- Laura Mercier Translucent Powder\n- Illamasqua Highlight in OMG\n- Illamasqua Gel Sculpt Contour\n- Charlotte Tilbury Filmstar Bronze and Glow\n- Laura Mercier Bronzer #4\n- Ben Nye Blush in Pink Bliss\n- I also played up to her natural freckles as she mentioned how much she loved Meghan Markle\u2019s wedding makeup and wanted to emulate that. I used Freck not to make new freckles but to enhance and bring back what was already there after the base was applied. \n\nBrows:\n\n- Mac Lingering &amp; Stud Pencils\n- Illamasqua Brow Build Gel in Thrive\n- Mac Clear Brow Gel\n\nEyes:\n\n- Mac Warm Breeze, Gingersnap, Dark Brew, Saddle &amp; Sandstone Shadows\n- Illamasqua Pigment in Fervent (a beautiful warm reddish brown duochrome with an emerald reflect, just on the lid) unfortunately you can\u2019t really see it in this picture as her eyes are open, but she wanted it to be very subtle. Topped this with a little bit of Suva Beauty\u2019s Emerald City for a subtle emerald shimmer when she looked down or closed her eyes. She was wearing an emerald green skirt to her event so it complimented it nicely :)\n- Eylure Volume Lashes #100\n- Kat Von D Liquid Eyeliner in Trooper\n- Clinique High Impact Mascara in Black\n- Illamasqua Pigment in Furore in the inner corners \n- Wunder2 Gel Pencil in Brown to tightline \n\nLips:\n\n- Charlotte Tilbury Lipliner in Pillowtalk\n- Gerard Cosmetics Lipstick in Vintage Rose\n\n",

                            "comment": "Hey girl! So I usually apply a corrector to conceal dark circles, with colour dependent on the skin tone. For light to medium Caucasian skin, I would use peach, patting it into dark areas with a flat concealer brush. I then blend it out really gently with a damp mini (eye area) beauty blender and layer extra in areas if necessary. \n\nIMO the key is to keep stepping back away from the face (or mirror if you\u2019re doing it on yourself) to assess from a distance if and where you need extra coverage. I\u2019ll sometimes get the client to tilt their chin down so I can see where the shadows are falling. Once I\u2019m happy, I\u2019ll set it pretty quickly with translucent powder to prevent the product from creasing or shifting around. I don\u2019t bake, I don\u2019t like it or believe in it to be honest and I would avoid it like the plague for more mature skin. I think the trick is just setting quickly and pushing the powder in with a fluffy brush, not using excessive amounts then dusting away anything visible left on the skin. \n\nIf the peach is too dark for the skin tone I\u2019ll mix in a paler concealer until I get it to about the right level. Illamasqua adjusters are really good for this, and I\u2019ve actually found that mixing a tiny bit of peachy liquid lipstick with my Recover Cosmetics concealers can make for a really nice corrector. Mainly because those concealers have such impeccable coverage and yet are still really thin, they\u2019re miracle workers. However they are also all yellow based and designed to be used for redness only so I wouldn\u2019t recommend using them alone for the undereye area.\n\nOn darker skin tones I\u2019d lean more towards orange, and something more pink for olive / Mediterranean skins). It\u2019s important to get the same level of lightness / darkness as the rest of the skin, or very slightly lighter. If you go with anything too dark in this area it will probably make the eye area look a bit sore.",

Personally I like to layer different products that have different tones and intensities to mimic the appearance and depth of natural brow hairs. \n\nI love using pencils because although they take longer, I think it gives me more control and looks more natural. Pressure also heavily depends on the product - for example the ABH brow pencils are more waxy so you can get away with pressing down harder, whereas the Mac pencils are a lot creamier so you have to have a lighter touch. \n\nI always start by brushing the hairs upwards with a clean spoolie brush, and continue to do so at intervals throughout the whole process so I can stay focussed on the shape I\u2019m trying to create. For my client pictured I started by building the shape that I wanted in feathery, hair like strokes with the lighter brow pencil (Mac Lingering). Once I\u2019m happy with the overall shape of the base layer, I\u2019ll go in with a darker pencil (in this case Mac Stud) and very lightly flick in hair strokes to create dimension. \n\nYou don\u2019t ever want it to get to a point where the colour looks too solid - I think that layering a darker shade is key in blending the lines between the real brow hairs and the ones you\u2019ve added, without it being obvious. I\u2019ll then finish off with a slick of Illamasqua Brow Build (which is similar to Benefit\u2019s Gimme Brow in that it contains small fibres), usually in a darker shade to continue the theme of layering, brushing them up and out to maximise their size and coverage. I finished off with some clear brow gel to be extra sure that everything was held in place, but this could be overkill! Hope that helps a bit! ",

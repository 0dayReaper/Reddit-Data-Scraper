    "postText": "I bought some makeup from the drug store because I\u2019ve been wanting to try it out. I got this lipstick/gloss that dries  mat but I CANT GET IT OFF. Like it doesn\u2019t bleed, water doesn\u2019t affect it, I tried cleanser and scrubbing with a cloth but I don\u2019t want to destroy my lips to get it off. It\u2019s deep red. Please help.\n\nEdit: the lipstick is Maybelline Super Stay Matte Ink.\nEdit pt. 2: THE OIL IS HELPING THANKS EVERYONE",

I love it cause I can\u2019t stand smearing my lipstick around while eating and drinking throughout the day - this is the only thing I\u2019ve tried that I can be confident will last while drinking and eating. It helps with my anxiety around makeup wearing honestly! Just know now that anything super stay, long wear, ultra waterproof etc, will need an oil or micellar water to get it off.",

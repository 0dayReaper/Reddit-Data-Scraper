I\u2019ve tried thinning them out but it didn\u2019t really work as this is pretty much the natural shape of my brows. Any advice would be appreciated! :) (sorry about the weird faces i make in pictures, had to use some saved ones as i don\u2019t have make-up on right now)",

Not thin it out to change the \u201cdensity\u201d of the hair, because that\u2019s perfect, but maybe try taking an eyebrow shaver to it (so it\u2019ll definitely grow back out if you don\u2019t like it) and maybe trim just a little off the edges toward the inside.",

I would consider thinning out the bottom side of them about 1-2 mm.\n2. The shape right now is very this shape \\  versus this shape ^. Meaning the tail of your brow starts very late almost at the very end of where your eye is. Do you pluck off the ends? I think if you brought the arch more inward toward the pupil of your eye and elongated the tail slightly the shape would offer symmetry!",

I would thin them out and try and take some off the bottom near your nose bc the way the square off and taper down makes you look angry almost. I tried to make a drawing LMFAO best way to describe what I\u2019m talking about. It\u2019s sucks sorry but hopefully makes sense. Top is sort of how it\u2019s shaped now but bottom I think would look better. More arched than how I drew it but hopefully you get the idea \ud83d\ude02\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a1irojbgbp5b1.jpeg?width=1576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b664c401f908179a13d5abc93cd1cf8efb0c1a29",

I have mine threaded. \n\nFor makeup, I can\u2019t tell if you have undereye circles or if it\u2019s product, but maybe a little less product under the eyes, or just the outer half. \n\nA little blush would help soften out the foundation. And I think a tinted lip gloss would be more forgiving than lipstick. \n\nYou look great! Keep practicing.",

Also a bit of blush is very feminizing.\n\nAlso (I know it's not makeup but...) everyone looks better if you don't use the wide angle selfie cam, it distorts the face quite a bit. (try taking a pic in a mirror to get some more space between you and the camera if you don't have the telephoto option on your phone) you will get a more accurate idea of how you look to other people. \n\nCongrats on living your best life. \nYou got this girlfriend .\n\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\u26a7\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaa",

More brightness on the inner corner of your eyes and with under eye concealer will nicely help open up your face! I\u2019d also recommend adding some color to the face, a little blush goes a long way!!\n\nFinally I\u2019d say don\u2019t be afraid to experiment with makeup.

You can also preemptively fold a tissue or toilet paper and place it under your eye when applying shadow. Tap the brush to dislodge excess powder before applying. The powder that falls will be caught by the paper. \n\nSometimes I\u2019ll save putting on concealer for the under eye after I put on eyeshadow. \n\nIf you want the eyeshadow pigment to show up more, use an eye cream base. In a pinch, you can use concealer as well. The powder will adhere to the cream/concealer and pop more. \n\nA little bit goes a long way. You can always apply more as you go. \n\nDepending on the make up shops near you, you could book a make up session and let them know that you\u2019re new to it. I\u2019ve found them to be pretty helpful if you give them an idea of what you\u2019re looking for, willing to spend, etc.",

            "comment": "I recommend testing a couple of different foundations, the one you're using looks like it's drying you out a bit. Some eyebrow shaping will work wonders and a bit of color correcting under your eyes should help minimize your eye bags. A bit of highlight on the inner edge will help brighten up your eyes and I recommend testing more neutral eyeshadow as it's much more forgiving \n\nFor the lips try experimenting with gloss and tinted balms to help keep them moisturized and healthy. I didn't see a primer on your makeup list but I recommend one to help your makeup sit more evenly (I personally prefer moisturizing primers but that's because I have dry patches). Lastly a setting spray will help your makeup last longer and depending on the type can give it a shimmery or matt finish",

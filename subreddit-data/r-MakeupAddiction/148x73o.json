I don't really have a problem with acne, but I get them at times. What products should I use for morning and night, and witch foundation would help me the most? Thank you!",

            "comment": "Skincare: The Ordinary's Niacinamide serum and Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant are really popular options for oil and pore control. A lightweight moisturizer is also important. Before makeup you should use a bit of moisturizer, the niacinamide, and then a good primer. Only use the exfoliant a few times a week. It's also kind of pricey, but they sell travel size versions so you can try it out.\n\nMakeup: For large pores you want a silicone-based primer like the elf poreless putty primer. The silicone will fill your pores helping to make your skin texture more even. Maybelline Fit Me Matte foundation is a popular option and it's affordable with a large shade range. A matte setting spray can help also.",

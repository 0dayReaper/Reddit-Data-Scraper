    "postText": "For me, the best long-lasting tint that I\u2019ve tried is the \u201cDior Addict Lip Tattoo Long-Wear Colored Tint\u201d. Oh boy, let me tell you, this product has an amazing long-lasting effect on the lips. It leaves quite a stain even after eating or drinking. \n\nUnfortunately, it has been discontinued (Based from what I read. Feel free to correct me!). Dior replaced it with a new line that has a weaker effect and I don\u2019t want to waste my money on that. \n\nFenty Beauty Poutsicle Hydrating Lip Stain seemed promising based on their marketing (and I love the stain factor), but upon further research, some users have been complaining that it goes away after eating and drinking. \n\nI tried the Korean lip tattoo products but they still don\u2019t have the long-lasting effect like the one from Dior. I am wondering, if you guys tried anything as good as the Dior or perhaps something better?\n\nHelp this girl out. I\u2019ve been researching for at least 2 months now. \ud83e\udd72",

What are your thoughts? \n\nI need to find something different because smashbox's corrector pencil that I've used for years is getting too cakey/ thick for my skin. \n('Cause, 30-something aging skin)\nRecommendations welcomed!",

I apply fairly sparingly with a fluffy concealer brush and have also used it as an eyeshadow primer. I set it with the matching Becca Under Eye Brightening Setting Powder. I'm very fair so I use the lightest for both.",

It\u2019s really emollient! I love it.",

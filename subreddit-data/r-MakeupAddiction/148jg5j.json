    "postText": "I\u2019ve been seeing this new Anastasia palette and I really want to buy it, but wanted to ask for opinions here? I know there is some controversy around Anastasia so pls don\u2019t come for me. I just love the eyeshadows they make and can\u2019t find anything better! But I\u2019m open to suggestions if you have any. \n\nI like that this palette has some pretty shimmers and versatile mattes. Before this one came out, I was eyeing Too Faced\u2019s Italian Spritz palette, but this Anastasia palette seems like a nice in-between since it has some unique shades as well as more muted everyday shades. The Italian Spritz one just has too many brights to be practical for me\u2026",

ABH and Urban Decay's limited edition palette often do half off sales in authorized distributer after some time. And man, every time I paid full price I get back stabbed like this.\n\nI'd also check out Viseart Soleil La Plage Etendu it's a beautiful petite palette with a mix of bright &amp; muted and shimmer &amp; matte!",

            "comment": "One consistent warning I've seen is not to order it online. If you're going to buy it, buy it in store. Apparently the shimmers are quite soft and many people have been getting shattered palettes in the mail. You'll get a refund, but it's not worth the trouble if you ask me.",

Heavy eye/lip makeup with fresh skin is not a look many people can pull off so I think it would really set you apart!",

I've trained my hair to only need a wash once a week or two, depending on what's going on and when I need to update color... (My hair is blue). It probably took me 4 months. Add a day every week, then add 2 days. Etc. The trick is using a balancing conditioning mask once every time you touch up dye, I use a balancing shampoo every wash which doesn't strip my hair down to nothing. It just cleans out the gunk and leaves the oils.\n\nI use Shea moisture (any will work)",

I get a bit of the pomade on the brush and put it on the back of my hand like a palette so it warms up and softens the product before applying. I start with the lower outline of the brow, starting about half way through the length of the brow towards the tail where I want them to be darkest/fullest/harshest. Once most of the product is off my brush I fill in the front with lighter brush pressure. Then I pretty messily fill in the bulk of the brow brushing upward towards where I want the top line to be, then I get a lil more product and go over the top 2/3 of the brow line to make it crisp but not too crisp near the front. Blend everything with a clean spoolie if you need to diffuse any harsh lines or blotchy pigment. I get like a full year\u2019s use out of one jar of dipbrow. THAT WAS PROBABLY WAY MORE INFO THAN YOU WANTED BUT THERE IT IS lmao",

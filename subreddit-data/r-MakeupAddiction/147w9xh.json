(bonus points if it has SPF) I\u2019ve been using vaseline morning, noon, and night for my extremely dry lips and it\u2019s not doing much for me and I despise the taste. \n\nI asked my friend and she recommended aquaphor, but she said it taste the same as vaseline does :(\n\nI would also appreciate any advice anyone has about keeping my lips hydrated and not dry and crackly!",

I believe it has a bit of lanolin mixed in with it, and the formula just hydrates and has a much more pleasant feeling than Vaseline does to me. \n\nIt does not have a flavor, but as someone who is sensitive to weird chemical tastes that things like carmex/Vaseline/Burt's bees imparts, I don't have an issue with Aquaphor. It's neutral imo.",

You\u2019re tasting it because you\u2019re licking and eating your lips bc they\u2019re too dry. I did exactly the same thing. \n\nVasaline is a barrier cream, same as aquaphor and any other petrolatum based cream. It\u2019s purpose is to keep moisture in, but if you don\u2019t have any to keep in, it\u2019s not gonna work. \n\nWhat you\u2019re gonna do is put whatever face cream without spf you use on your lips. Then cover with a layer of aquaphor, or I like Elizabeth Arden 8 hour cream, if it\u2019s within your budget. The one in the tube is best. Do this overnight for literally however long you want. I\u2019ve seen results within a day. \n\nDuring the day you need a lip balm with moisturizing ingredients - not a petrolatum based lip balm - so stuff like lanolin, vitamin E, butters. Burts bees would be good if you have a smell you like, EOS has sticks, Nivea also has sticks. Point isn\u2019t what kinda chapstick. Point is what\u2019s in it. \n\nTLDR: \nday = moisturizing ingredients \nNight = literal moisturizer on lips, then use aquaphor or other barrier cream. This keeps the moisture in, and won\u2019t evaporate when you sleep, move around etc. \n\nGood luck!",

Most stuff  without flavor is gonna taste pretty much the same 2) I second aquaphor, I think the advice to use Vaseline is bad advice. It\u2019s just an occulusive. It doesn\u2019t moisturize, it\u2019s not a humectant, it\u2019s not a well rounded product. Aquaphor is. The only spf lip balm I can use that doesn\u2019t dry out my lips is Paula\u2019s choice. The regular PC lip balm is good too, but aquarphor works just as well and is cheaper.",

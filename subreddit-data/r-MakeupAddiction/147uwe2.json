            "comment": "I like to accentuate the features I like about my face, personally! I really like my eyes, so despite them being hooded, I spend a lot of time there. Everything else sort of takes a second place \ud83d\ude02\n\nI think you have beautiful eyes and cheeks. Your eyes would be excellent for eyeshadow-forward looks, and definitely adding a lovely blush would be fun! Eyebrows also really make a difference in the way your face looks, so my best advice there would be to keep a light hand as you learn and explore that one.\n\nI learned most of what I do on YouTube, and through practice. I did my own makeup for my wedding, so I practiced the same look over and over, till I was very comfortable with it! Wedding makeup is often fairly safe, so when I wanted colour, I simply changed the neutral eyeshadows to colourful ones.\n\nRemember to have fun! And, you\u2019re gorgeous. Stunning. Beautiful!",

What part of your face do you love most?  What part do you want to accent or minimize?  Do you like color?  Keep in mind, too, your brow shape &amp; hair color.  I've recently done an eggplant color &amp; had to adjust my work makeup.  Just be YOU!  Have fun, dear one!!!\ud83d\udc9c",

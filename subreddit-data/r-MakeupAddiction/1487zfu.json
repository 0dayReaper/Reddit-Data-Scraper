Hope this works for you \u2764\ufe0f",

Lately i've been going in with the NYX dewy setting spray, waiting for it to dry, and THEN powdering very lightly with the Laura Mercier loose setting powder. I think that powder does a really good job of setting without making everything look matte, especially if done with a light hand.",

I exfoliate a few times a week. I have dry/normal skin. I have a good skincare regime. When I use liquid foundation or TM, everything looks flawless. Any input? \n2nd pic is the primers I've used and the powders I use. Thanks for any help!!",

A glass of water, a spritz of glycerin-water solution, and apply another light coat of powder should help. Sticking to the primers that list water as their first ingredient and do not have silicones in them helps too. Cheers.",

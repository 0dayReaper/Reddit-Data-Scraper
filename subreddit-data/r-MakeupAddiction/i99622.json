The KKW one you can find [here](https://www.ulta.com/nude-creme-lipstick?productId=pimprod2010845) or go to any ulta and ask them for the KKW nude lipsticks! I first applied the KKW one, I would say it\u2019s more of a pale, brown toned nude. Then on top I applied a bit of the Bobbi Brown lipstick in the shade Bare to give it more of a pink tone, you can find that lipstick at Sephora or probably any major department stores like Nordstrom! I would also suggest the lipstick from NARS in the shade Pigalle, that one is also a beautiful blushed coral pink, which you can also find at Sephora! Hopefully this was helpful!",

I applied only one pump of foundation, could\u2019ve probably done with less. For coverage in the undereye area or any spot you feel you may need more, go in with concealer. It\u2019s lighter and you won\u2019t need to layer so much product as you would using foundation. I used both a setting powder and a setting spray on her but for powder I just dipped my beauty blender in once and managed to use it for her whole face. You want it to be light because I find for aging skin mattifying products can emphasize lines more. Any setting spray should be fine!\n\nI suggest watching the makeup artist Hindash on YouTube, his techniques I think are beautiful that could work on any age and I think he may have a tutorial on an older woman!",

Ones that I really liked that are either full coverage or buildable are Fenty matte foundation, smashbox foundation, or Est\u00e9e Lauder double wear. I think these foundations are able to provide coverage without the need of layering it. And I do suggest getting a concealer maybe the same shade as your foundation to apply over certain blemishes for that extra coverage without that extra layer of foundation.",

I will keep that in mind.\n\nDo you usually use that in makeup services? I am  curious because of the high Spf.\n\nLastly I think her eyes could use a touch more pop if she's already comfortable wearing this much makeup. A soft smoky black liner or a pair of baby lashes. It would sharpen up the eyes a bit!",

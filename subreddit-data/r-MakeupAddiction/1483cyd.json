No raccoon eyes anymore!  Now, I (54F) went into full-stop menopause last summer &amp; lots of things changed.  Products that worked forever stopped working.  I've adjusted.  Just something to think about in the event you've had any hormonal changes, medication changes, etc.  Good luck, dear one!\ud83d\udc9c",

Instead of running, it kind of crumbles off and disappears unless you rub your eyes hard. It\u2019s the only mascara I use now for that reason. Looks just fine when I put it on, comparable to others, but so much more functional.",

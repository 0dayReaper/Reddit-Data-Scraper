            "comment": "Looks beautiful! My only suggestions would be a touch of a medium pinky nude lip liner (like CT pillow talk) and maybe a bit of clear gloss. A little bit more blush would be good too! A pinky one to match your lip. I can give you some suggestions at diff price points if you like. The eyes look amazing, you could add an inner corner highlight for a pop if you want :) congratulations!",

For blush, Neutrogena healthy skin blush in Rosy is a really nice classic matte pink. Milani\u2019s baked blush in Dolce Pink is gorgeous if you like more sheen to your blush and not a flat matte. Benefit WANDERful world silky powder blush in Shellie is also worth a look. Comes in a mini size. You could also layer another coat of mascara on if you want!",

Eyes in general look great but a little bit of shiny/shimmery eyeshadow in the inner corner could transform it into more polished look.\n\nFoundation looks cakey. Remember to exfoliate and moisturize your skin well because that gives you the best base for makeup.\n\nI'm sorry if I sound like an asshole but it's a special day for you and I don't want you to look back at photos from your wedding and think \"Oh, too bad I didn't do my makeup differently\"",

Flat is definitely a great way to describe what I felt about it and I also thought a shimmer in gold or pink would brighten the eyes way more. In regards to foundation it looks so cakey to me as well, i have dry acne prone skin so I don\u2019t wear foundation often. Do you know if airbrush makeup would stop the cakey look? I want to avoid the face cake at all costs! \ud83d\ude35 \u274c",

I\u2019m not current with brands and products, but I\u2019m sure these ladies have suggestions!\n\nI used to use a Josie Maran primer and it was pricey but it made my makeup look so much nicer. I believe there was a mini version, might be worth a bit of a splurge for such a special event!",

Some 25-year-olds end up looking 35 or 40 after a lot of filler injections. \n\nJust be careful, folks.",

There are a lot of problems with it, but unique features and looks are celebrated and they don\u2019t just plastic-surgery-and-facetune themselves into having the same exact face. The goal is an unconventionally striking look rather than just all the same thing. Instagram on the other hand is like a funhouse mirror of conventional beauty standards. Big \u201cInfluencers\u201d all look essentially the same. It\u2019s turning into exactly what kpop was criticized for years earlier, just with a different ideal",

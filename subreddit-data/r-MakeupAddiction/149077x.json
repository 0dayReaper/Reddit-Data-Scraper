    "postText": "\nI just wanted to give an honest review of Sunset Makeup, as there\u2019s not a lot of people reviewing it, but they are huge on TikTok. I finally gave in after being tempted by how amazing the quality of their products looked on TikTok. I spent about $80 on six glosses and two liquid matte lipsticks. Though the shipping was only a few days, I was extremely disappointed when I received my products. The packaging/containers are extremely cheap, the applicators terrible. The quality of the actual product was not much better. The lip gloss is pretty, but it\u2019s thick and sticky and really uncomfortable to wear. I had to take it off immediately. The matte liquid lipsticks were chunky coming out of the tube and is immediately drying and crumbly when you put it on. It did last decently long and did not feather, but eating and drinking with it on is a no no. It also does not layer with their gloss. \n\nI am so sad with how they advertise, because the actual product is nowhere near how it looks. \n\nI read a few posts on Reddit saying their products were drop shipped from Alibaba, and I didn\u2019t want to believe it but it really seems that way. $1 products being sold for $10. I also left honest, 3 star reviews on their website of the products I bought and they seem to be deleted, as it seems they have a track record of deleting negative reviews/comments. \n\nHopefully this helps someone and saves them a bit of money! I hope their other products besides the lip products are good.",

    "postText": "Hi makeup lovers! I am looking to refresh my makeup routine, in fact I'm not sure I've ever been doing my makeup right, and I'm at the point where I need some serious application pointers and/or makeup recommendations, particularly with problematic issues like dark circles, acne scars, contouring etc. I am looking for a vlogger who can provide me with basic, but game changing makeup tips and tricks. Who should I be watching, or at least where should I begin? TIA!",

            "comment": "Hello ! I am not a vlogger,but I am a certified makeup artist and I post on TikTok,and I hope my opinion helps you.Firstly for acne scars I recommend you to have a good skincare routine,as far as I know you should use SPF daily,azelaic acid,I am not a doctor so my opinion is kinda useless , and I suggest you to see a doctor,that\u2019s only if you want your skin to look good without makeup,and for dark circles I recommend caffeine cream and retinol eye cream.For makeup first step is to start with your hands washed and your brushes must be clean especially the ones you work cream products with.The the face preparation is one of the most important steps in makeup,so you should clean your face with a micellar water, then use a toner (pixi has good ones I saw that Sephora has some new ones,if it helps I use Synergy therm in balance but i know that s only a Romanian brand).Then you should hydrate your face,neutrogena refreshingly clear is my top recommendation it also has vitamin c which is good for the skin,and then I apply on the lips a lip balm.If you want a way more resistant makeup I suggest a primer (here depends on your skin , I use laneige primer for a glowing base , but I have normal skin,for others I use Dior backstage and if they have big pores I use huda blur jam silicone primer)You should be very careful with what products you choose to apply because if you do not clean the makeup in a proper way it can cause clogging pores and worse acne &amp; comedones.For foundation I recommend, from expensive to affordable Dior backstage(but has a bit of perfume),Makeup for ever hd,Giorgio Armani luminous silk,Bobbi brown lightweight foundation, Milani foundation and nyx born to glow(i apply the foundation with a brush then pick up the excess with a beauty blender that\u2019s always clean!!!).For concealer there are a lot of options nyx can\u2019t stop won\u2019t stop , fenty beauty , huda beauty,dior backstage,MAYBELLINE concealer anti age (as far as I know huda beauty is the one that covers a lot).I usually apply it with a natural goat hair brush but can easily be applied with the beauty blender or brush,if you have eyeshadow I recommend to use a blending brush to diffuse the concealer into shadow.For powder again depends on your skin , huda beauty is my top choice but the fenty one is good to , nyx can\u2019t stop won\u2019t stop,mac.For cream contour I recommend rare beauty , and for liquid blush I recommend also rare beauty(for me this two are an optional step,but if I do them I apply them with the brush,and pick up the excess with the beauty blender,and also apply before powder).A good powder palette for contour is the Mac one or nyx or kat von d,and for bronzer I say fenty beauty or benefit or Mac single one .For blush depends on what you want,I suggest Mac Melba/peaches,Kylie winter kissed,too faced the new ones,Catrice,morphe.For highlighter , I know it\u2019s very very expensive but the Dior backstage highlighter palette 001 has my heart from day one,also mac soft&amp;gentle,Catrice essence,(and for liquid one I say rare beauty/Catrice).Mascara I guess essence/L\u2019Or\u00e9al , I don\u2019t invest in the expensive ones because they don\u2019t stay all night long.For eyebrows I recommend benefit 24h setter and a brown eyeshadow and a small brush , or nyx tint pen .For eyebrows I recommend beauty bay palettes , because they are very affordable and very pigmented.Lips I suggest Mac lip liners or essence lip liners and whatever lipstick you want.If you want to know how to apply them you can watch Nikkie Tutorials or Laura Lee , Many Mua,Hindash.Hope this helped and didn\u2019t offend you \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f!",

I am self conscious of even wearing sunglasses or hats because I feel like they draw more attention to my mouth. People can carry so much insecurity around in our mouths. It\u2019s funny because reading through these comments, people are pointing out how nice her teeth actually are and how pretty she is. Some nice people in my life also have gone out of their way to let me know how much they like my gap, and think it\u2019s a special part of me that \u201cmakes me, me.\u201d It\u2019s hard to believe that, but seeing how OP feels versus how almost everyone else feels gives me a more positive feeling about my own insecurity too :)",

How little do they have going on in their life to critique whatever has personally offended them about your teeth just existing in your mouth? Like I wouldn\u2019t do that. I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t do that either. They probably just see a nice person who they can put down to make themselves feel better. Don\u2019t give them the satisfaction!\n\nI also wanted to say, you have definitely nailed your undertone!! That\u2019s so hard to do. But for real, eye brows, hair, glasses frames, and lipstick are all just the perfect undertone for you. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to critique someone who\u2019s so close to the right shade but something is just \u2026 off. You know? Like almost right but not quite. But then this is an example of hitting a bulls eye with undertone! Looks great :)",

Fuck this nonsense\".  Just don't wait until it's too late like I did.  You only get one go at this world.  Don't let other people steal it from you.

Very honest. 55 year old guys who stumble onto a picture like this in the \"popular\" section of reddit should be nothing if not very honest.\n\nYou have a very nice face. It is proportioned. Your eyes are kind, and I like the color very much. I like the contrast between your hair color and your complexion. The shade of lipstick you selected today goes well with the entire package. I hope they don't delete too much of your eyebrows, because in this photo they are expressive and to my thinking anyway, about perfect. I am hardly an expert however. The mysteries involved in women's appearance care are something guys like me will never understand fully. We just know what we like and what looks \"nice\". \n\nAnd now for the teeth... The teeth you worry so much about: They are beautifully straight. They are beautifully white and obviously well cared for by you. They are the punctuation to your smile. They are better than my teeth were back in the day, because I needed two years of braces and your teeth are STILL straighter than mine.\n\nSo, to be brutally honest, you look very nice indeed, and I can see from your eyes that you are likely a nice person also.  I hope you shall have a nice day at your appointment, and that you enjoy the new look you shall receive there.",

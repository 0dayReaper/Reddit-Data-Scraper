You are beautiful.\nI'm a makeup artist.\nI found the way to drop that lower lid and open that eye up with the white eyeliner is to do one of two things:\nTry a NUDE LINER that is a little bit lighter than your own skin tone and watch the magic.  OR, try other lighter colors (mint green, baby blue, etc)!\n\nAnd/or APPLY more mascara below the white line and watch the magic.\n\nGreat start! \ud83e\udd17\nMJ",

Here\u2019s how to make it look less flat: It\u2019s good to start in the inner corners and end the white liner around the middle of the waterline. You could even add some darker brown liner at the outer corners of your waterline to make the white pop more without looking flat. Keep the white waterline, it looks beautiful, just refine it!",

U could also try dropping the white completely, adding more mascara to the lower lash line (with emphasis on the outer corners), gliter on the eyelids, and a little bit of smidged light brown or brown just under the waterline. You've got pretty eyes so u don't need much to make them pop.",

So you\u2019re pretty much drawing on your eyeball but obv the point is to get the thin strip of skin on the insides of your lids that the lashes grow off of. That\u2019s my go to, but you need a good liner for that space. I like Ardency Inn - Modster, and smash box has a good one too.",

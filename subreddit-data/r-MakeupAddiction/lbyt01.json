Did you at least start with a faint outline of the overall shape as a guide and then fill it in, or just work progressively one section at a time? How long did it take altogether?",

I've just done a valentines one actually that I'm gonna post tomorrow I think, not quite as detailed as this but yknow ahahah\n\nAw thank you angel, so I start with one very thin line in the basic space that I want sort of as the guide and then I made it thicker with white so I basically had one long white graphic liner. Then I just started from the inner corner adding the colours as I went. I think that's why some people think it looks metallic or I think it looks kind of like a sticker bc the white is fully underneath the whole thing. If that makes sense at all! This took me about 30-45 minutes but I wasn't rushing. I could have done it a bit speedier but I enjoy the process of applying makeup and I kept stopping to take photos of my progress \ud83d\ude02",

I was thinking that I couldn't imagine doing it section by section and just trying to picture the desired final shape as you go, but didn't see any noticable outline, so I wasn't sure. That totally makes sense though. The white base is probably also what makes the tan shades kind of pop, too.\n\n\n&gt;This took me about 30-45 minutes but I wasn't rushing.

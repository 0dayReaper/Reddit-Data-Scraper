I find that a real weird analogy. Canvases are painted to share a creative vision, or tell a visual narrative. You are so right in that it\u2019s like an artist with a canvas because many women adorn their faces and hair and bodies with the intention to weave a visual story; it IS artistry much of the time.  \n\nThere is a difference between makeup used to cover blemishes and dark circles and the kind of creativity shown in many posts on this sub. Obviously many people of all genders use makeup to hide \u201cimperfections\u201d and look more attractive, but if you take a look through a lot of the submissions on this sub you will also see some almost pro-level artistry showcasing creative work beyond just making someone \u201cattractive\u201d.",

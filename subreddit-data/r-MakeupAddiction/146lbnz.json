I'm currently going through rounds of electrolysis so have quite a few red and pigmented areas to cover and this does the job very well.\n\nI have a full questions since its obviously gone onto you very well; Do you use the lock it Primer and powder?  I wouldn't usually use primer but I was advised to do so but I'm noticing that after applying the foundation over the primer (even with a 10m+ bake in time) that I'm getting weird spots in the foundation that looks like the primer trying to bleed through, so I have to sponge on more foundation on top.    It looks a bit like what happens when you try and put foundation on too soon after moisturising.\n\nIt does tend to go a bit orange if I use a bit of it just under my eyebrows as a base but I think that's a me problem.",

For me it prevents cracking, sweating through it as well as creasing. Don\u2019t overpower a long wear foundation, because it\u2019s meant to create a film over top and stay. If you want matte use powder, but over moisturising with different things can actually disrupt the longevity of it. Try less with these types of products. Hope this helps! \ud83d\ude18",

I would say if you have dry flaky skin your best bet would be a sponge for application although the brand says that it hydrates while combating oil at the same time with ingredients I don\u2019t remember. Get a sample to try before buying because it\u2019s on the expensive side and also I would suggest trying it if you need full coverage, lightweight and long lasting as well as soft matte finish. It has that little dewy film but it can be powdered away really easily so beware of that!",

I think it\u2019s really reliable formula so you\u2019ll be good to go either way. \ud83d\ude09",

The point is it\u2019s not in every crack or pore as you say girlie. If i stretch my skin my makeup is smooth as baby bum. I have textured acne prone skin. It\u2019s not cakey you\u2019re seeing texture. So sorry for that you need to see filtered skin. But full coverage as I LIKE looks like that. And also a tip if you don\u2019t powder your face as mine and of curiosity I want you tell how does your cracks look when you push your tongue around your upper lip and chin area bet you\u2019ll see tiny cracks. \ud83d\ude0f",

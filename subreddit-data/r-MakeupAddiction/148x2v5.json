    "postText": "I'm not super thrilled with how my make up turned out for the [trial run](https://imgur.com/a/achelAj). I had asked for a bit more of a natural look.. \n\nMake up artist wants to use darker blush the day of and a mauve/darker shade of lipstick.\n\nAlong with input, I had a few questions regarding the whole situation.\n\nFor a trial run-is it normal to use cheap make up for a trial run then better quality later? Like she used the pink and green Maybelline, which clumps terribly and bothers my eyes a lot.\n\nWould it be bad to bring in my some of own make up for her to use? Or ask her to use better quality?  (Paying like $750 before tip for trial and day of. Edit: the trial was $200, her total cost would be $750 w/ travel. Not that it makes a difference, just clarifying.)\n\nAndddd is it bad taste if I have someone else do my eye make up but her do everything else? \n\nThanks in advance, just very much so out of my element here to say the least.\n\nEdit: thank you all sooooo much for the input, seriously. I've been scrambling all afternoon/evening trying to sort this out after learning the one wedding mua locally was booked for our date (I live rural AF so limited options for everything). I reached out to one mua whose portfolio is 90% natural looking make up and extensive but unsure of availability or willingness to travel. Made a consultation call with another mua who seems to specialize in wedding hair and make up and has availability on the day of the wedding, also incredibly extensive portfolio.",

That\u2019s the whole point of trial, so there\u2019s no surprises and you have time to decide and make sure that you like the look and are on board with the vision. \n\nJust me, but I would NOT use this artist. This is not $750 makeup, even if she is on location\u2026 just super amateur, low quality work.",

It\u2019s not about what she wants, and she\u2019s not even a good artist to be trying to push her vision on you like that. The shadow looks muddy, and dragging the heavy liner and clumpy mascara under your eye is\u2026 not a good look. Just the blending, the colour choices, the heavy liner, the brows are harsh and patchy, I\u2019m sure rushing didn\u2019t help but this is amateur skill level all around.

I've had makeup looks done for free at a beauty counter far better than this, and Maybelline isn't the best of brands, least of all for a wedding day look that's supposed to last. I would definitely find another artist with better products and techniques (probably for cheaper too). From what I can see, the blending on the eyeshadow ended up muddy and the dark liner is giving an unfortunate raccoon effect. Your face is quite pretty and deserves better technique to highlight said prettiness.",

The product/\"technique\" she used makes them look like she just uniformly coloured in an eyebrow shaped stencil instead of actually enhancing the brow hairs.\n* The brown eyeshadow should not have been brought past your inner corner, let alone all the way to the bridge of your nose. It also should have been blended up AND out to balance it and open up your eyes, but she seems to have just blended everything straight upward. As another commenter mentioned, it's a very dated technique and does not look natural like you wanted. \n* The eyeliner looks patchy, almost like she used a product that's drying out. It should not be the same thickness from corner to corner; it should be tapered down to nothing by the time it reaches your inner corner. There should also be a bit of a lift at the outer corner to open up your eye. It doesn't have to be a full on winged liner look, but it should not end downward. A thick arc like that weighs down your eyes, and when paired with equally thick dark liner on the bottom, you end up with the circular racoon eye effect. \n* The mascara is a disaster. I genuinely cannot believe she sent you out the door with that. Aside from the obvious clumpiness, just like the liner, it should also become gradually thicker toward the outer corners to open your eyes. \n* There doesn't seem to be any technique to the blush aside from just being dusted on the general cheek area. Like eyeshadow, it should be applied up and out to lift your face. Photos tend to wash you out so it's really important to have that dimension and structure that properly applied blush and bronzer add. \n* Your lips don't seem to be cleanly lined or defined, which again will get muted even more in photos. The lipstick colour is a very odd choice and does not coordinate with the eyeshadow so I do not understand why a \"professional\" would choose it for this look. \n\nAgain, my points have absolutely nothing to do with how YOU personally look so please do not interpret any of them as a criticism of your appearance. You are a gorgeous lady with beautiful skin, full brows, striking bright eyes, and full lips and it would be a complete disservice to choose an artist that does not emphasize the beauty in those features to their fullest potential. Please please please consider going with another artist altogether, you deserve to look and feel your best on your special day.",

Soft lines and shimmer.\n\nHonestly, you could go to a beauty counter and schedule a session where they can help you achieve the look you want.\n\nFor what I\u2019m recommending it would be very easily achievable with a little bit of practice.\n\nDo not work with this artist. 750$!

I like the lip color, but I\u2019m fairly underwhelmed by everything else, if I\u2019m being honest. \n\nYou need to politely tell the makeup artist that you don\u2019t think that the two of you are a good fit. My sister got married last year, and although she had already chosen a makeup artist *and* gone through a trial that she was happy with, she had her makeup done by a different artist for an unrelated event, and loved the other artist\u2019s work more. She had to have an uncomfortable conversation with with her initial artist, and she lost a little bit of money, but she was totally satisfied with her makeup on her wedding day. Please don\u2019t settle! You want to feel totally confident on your special day! \n\nCongratulations!",

By the looks of the makeup she may just have started her makeup journey and is in the process of learning how to apply makeup, she should have charged you maybe a model/beginner price. I suggest getting on Pinterest/tiktok to look for wedding makeup inspo so you can get an idea of how you\u2019d like your makeup to look. Also look for your MUA artist through Instagram you can just search (your city MUA) a whole bunch of talented MUAs should show up. Good luck! &amp; congrats! :)",

You\u2019re so beautiful and you have some beautiful colors going on in your rich brown hair, light eyes, and skin. We just gotta find the complimentary colors! incorporate the gold from the hair piece into the eyes and you will look even more heavenly than you already look! \ud83e\udd70",

And that eyeliner application is unacceptable... I just can't.\n\nThe price she has quoted is not out of the norm if she is charging you a day rate (for you and the bridal party) + trial &amp; travel but any good MUA would use the same products at the trial as they would on the day and they would be using quality products. They would also FIX anything at the trial that you weren't keen on so you can wear the makeup for the rest of the day and report back on any issues.\n\nI won't harp on further as there have been many other things mentioned and suggested by other users but one thing I would suggest is considering false lashes if you are open to the idea. I use to recommend individuals or demi-lashes (they're light and don't feel as uncomfortable as full strip lashes) just to accentuate the outer corner of the eyes, it gives a lovely lift to all eye shapes and sizes and adds nice definition in photos.\n\nGood luck and I hope you have a lovely wedding :)\n\nSource: EX MUA that did too many weddings and got burnt out lol",

The technique is really poor and you certainly aren't a glowing bride look at all.\n\nFor that much money you could realistically buy good quality products and do it yourself. Honestly.\n\nYou'll need to do a bit of research - what matters is staying power vs what you'd do on an ordinary day - and layering a bit so that it lasts AND photographs well. (Flash photography can make you look wayyyyyy more natural than you'd like, esp after a few hours.) So primers, setting certain areas, layering products is important. but that is easy to learn! Esp if you like a natural look.\n\nI would book an application at Bobbi Brown - they excel at natural glowing bridal look - and what you pay for it can be applied to product purchase.",

    "postText": "I have been searching for a long wearing drugstore lip product which will stay on throughout a night of clubbing. I tried the maybelline superstay matte ink and it\u2019s just a little too matte for my liking, i prefer a glossier, satin finish. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!",

            "comment": "Have you tried any shades from Maybelline's Superstay Vinyl Ink lipstick range? It's a liquid lipstick as well that's meant to be budge resistant while being noticeably shinier than a matte one. \n\nI've heard of good experiences of it as long as you shake it well and apply it without putting your lips together as it dries. I believe the formula is comparable to Haus Labs Atomic Shake Lip Lacquer and Urban Decay Vice Lip Bond but at a drugstore price range.",

Lots of brands make good ones and they'll usually be called some variation on glossy/water/juicy tints.  I've tried and liked the ones from romand, girlcult, and ators. They go on as a glossy gel and over time the shine wears off but the color stays.",

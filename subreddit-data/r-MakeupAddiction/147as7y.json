I will say that with the number of shades they offer &amp; the weird way they describe their shades, finding a match can be tricky (took me 3 tries to get it right) but if you have a Sephora nearby you can get two samples to take home and try at a time. A little goes a LONG way. I think my bottle will last me over a year with how infrequently I wear full coverage these days, but every time I wear it I\u2019m blown away.",

It\u2019s perfectly buildable, great shade range, hydrating, and dries to a beautiful natural-dewy finish. A puff with my favorite pressed powder can easily turn it into a soft velvet-matte finish as well. It works wonderfully with cream products while damp and with powder products once dried down a bit.",

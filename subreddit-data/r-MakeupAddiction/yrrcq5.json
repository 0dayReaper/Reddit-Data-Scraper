I think it adds interest and I find scars fascinating and beautiful but I understand when you have such a distinctive trait how exhausting it can be to have to constantly field the attention. \n\nTry asking the r/skincareaddiction sub to see if there are any products they know of that could help soften the indentation or reduce the appearance of the scar. \n\nI have known people to use silicon tape or some kind of putty \"scar filler\" and put foundation over top to blend. It would need a heavy foundation or concealer, and you'll either need a crazy good color match or to cover your whole face.",

Or as someone else said, microneedling. I am optimistic about both of those. \n\nDon't go to a random derm though, they vary a LOT in competence and how much they're willing to rip you off. \n\nIt's basically a mechanic for your face. A bad one is BAD. And you can't go based on price/etc.\n\nRead some blogs on *how* to pick a derm, and read up on the procedures you're interested in.

I don't mind them so much, but I work with kids a lot and they often have questions that it's not really appropriate for me to address, so I'm looking into ways to make them less noticeable. They are lighter in pigment than surrounding skin and some of the bigger ones are raised, so kind of the opposite presentation to OP's scar. Do you think microneedling could help in this case? I plan to get a cover-up tattoo as well but I think the raised ones would still stand out. Thanks if you do have any thoughts!&lt;\n\nEDIT: took a minute to figure out the spoiler tags, sorry!",

I don't know how well it would work for a deep scar such as yours, and they recommend using it as soon as you get a scar for best results. Perhaps you've even tried it! I use it for a couple small surgical scars I have and have no complaints. Figured I'd throw it out there as a suggestion! \n\nWhat I **really** wanted to say tho is that your scar looks so cool! It's not at all scary, or distracting from your face. It's very distinguishable actually! Maybe you should work on owning it instead of disliking it? You're lucky, in a sense, because some scars turn out extremely discolored and jagged, which yours isn't. I know I'm not you, and I hope you understand what I'm saying isn't me trying to tell you what to do. I just hope one day you'll come to embrace it, rather than trying to cover it up! : )",

Ample sun protection really helps with the appearance of lines and wrinkles, and it helps keep scars from darkening or worsening in appearance. I'd recommend a physical sunscreen, something with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide as the main ingredient for best UV protection. \n\nI'd also like to add that, while I understand your concerns and wouldn't ever want to dismiss them, I think you are a distinguished looking gentleman and the scar doesn't diminish your good looks in any way. Our lines tell stories and, while some might be incredibly painful, you have survived and are still here with us, which is worth celebrating.

            "comment": "Hello there! There are a ton of comments here so I don't know if this will be seen. There indeed is a product on the market intended to fill and conceal scars. The company also claims use of their product improves scar appearance over time. It's called Dermaflage. If you search around for it and read some reviews on Amazon, it has mixed reviews. It's hard to use and the learning curve is sharp, as well as it being a little pricey. I would recommend watching some youtube or tiktok tutorials from real humans and not Dermaflage before you buy. I consider myself skilled with makeup and I had a bit of a hard time with it. \n\nLike everyone else said, it's a totally bitchin' scar. I have my own facial scars from accidents that I am horrendously self conscious of and I understand how you feel. In fact, the one that had 9 staples in it is throbbing at the moment and I'm trying not to scratch it. \n\nI'm curious if the number of times people ask about it is the thing that bothers you most about the scar, or if the scar itself reminds you of something you would rather forget? Both of those can be eased a little bit by working with a therapist and I highly recommend seeking guidance because it can help reframe or plan how to speak to people about your appearance. It helped me learn how to set boundaries without alienating people! \n\nAlso, if you decide the route of visiting facial-plastic surgeons or going the medical route, get many different quotes and different opinions if you can. There is a website, RealSelf, where you can post photos and have doctors weigh in on what procedures might work. There are lots of different little hyaluronic fillers now with small molecules of HA intended to move and flex, so you might actually have luck with something for lips. \n\nFrom one scarred up badass to another, I think your scar is fabulous and distinguishing looking.",

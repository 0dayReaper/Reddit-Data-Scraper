    "postText": "hi :) dis me.\ni\u2019m beginning to get a little bored and frustrated because i feel like i look the same all the time (especially during special occasions) and i would like to learn how to apply makeup to enhance my features. \nmy routine is extremely basic and consists of filling in my brows a bit and putting on mascara. a single false lash, drop of foundation, contouring, lipstick/lipgloss or even concealing my brows can make me look extremely clownish, dramatic and over done which isn\u2019t what i want. \nany tips on how to enhance my features or make them pop a bit more? i would really appreciate some advice for eye makeup as well &lt;33\n(also it\u2019s not about my technique or skill, i\u2019m a traditional artist and very skilled with my hands, i can do other people\u2019s makeup perfectly but i struggle with my own)",

I would go super minimal, which it sounds like you\u2019re already doing (love the single false lash) and fill in your brows just a bit more so the inner brows are closer together. You don\u2019t need to contour, I would just add a dab of highlighter here and there, and maybe a pop of pink color on your lips or cheeks. Again, your bone structure is naturally beautifully so you can just play up your natural features. Please update us!",

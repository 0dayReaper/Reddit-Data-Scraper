    "postText": "So I took everyone\u2019s opinion into consideration, I did a natural gloss and thinner brows. I also have no foundation on so it\u2019s more natural, and I did a more nude natural eyeshadow with some curls around my face. I also took the advice and changed up my glasses. Im very lucky to have multiple pairs so I hope this made a difference \u2764\ufe0f let me know how this compares to the picture I posted yesterday. Also, I\u2019m sorry my lips have a really harsh Cupid\u2019s bow \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d that\u2019s just how my lips look guys \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

    "postText": "Looks like one of these hasn't been asked in awhile. Wanted to hear your thoughts for yourself or just in general. \n\nI have combination skin with a little bit of texture (30s but use tret).\n\nUsed to use:\n\n-  Too Faced - Born This Way Powder Foundation. Got discontinued. \n\n- Patrick Starrr's One/Size - Turn Up The Base Powder Foundation. It was a bit heavy for me, although a great product. \n\nNow using: \n\n- MUFE's - Matte Velvet Skin Blurring Powder Foundation. I love this product, super buildable, melts into my skin, lasts, yada yada. BUT it recently got reformulated \ud83e\udd2c Haven't tried the reformulated version yet but a bit worried from the reviews.\n\nWant to hear what y'all like, what works for your skin? What hasn't worked? Do you like or hate powder foundation? Looking more for discussion rather than just for myself.",

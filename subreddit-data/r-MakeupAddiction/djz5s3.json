After I complete the upper eye makeup, I take makeup remover to clean up the fallout from any eyeshadow or smudging from the upper eye makeup. I like to use a Q Tip with eye makeup remover to clean up the small smudging near my lower waterline/eyelid. Then I put on my face makeup like foundation concealer and powder. Lastly, I put on the rest of my lower eye makeup so that it is clean from the previous makeup cleaning and foundation/ concealer application.",

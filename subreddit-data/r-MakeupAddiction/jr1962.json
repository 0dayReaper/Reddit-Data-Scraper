I won the arm-over-arm truck pull which is kind of a specialty event for me given that I'm quite tall, and I won a sandbag loading medley where I had to pick up, carry, and load four sandbags of increasing weight to a 46\" platform. That was a nail biter and came down to the very last millisecond! \n\nI got second in the Circus Dumbbell which is a single arm overhead press. It's actually one of my best events but I felt a crunch in my shoulder on the third rep and was only able to eke out one more without fear of seriously injuring my shoulder. As is, I need to get it checked out by a doctor now. I also got second in the max distance hussafel carry (google a hussafel) which is a brutal event and was previously a weakness of mine. I went 368 feet with it and was super pleased with second place! \n\nI got fourth in the sandbag over bar event, which wasn't ideal but honestly it went better in the competition than it ever did in training, so I was super pleased with it!\n\nAnd I got fifth in the basket deadlift event, which was my worst placing but one of my best personal events since I trained for this competition immediately after recovering from a serious back injury sustained while deadlifting. I was super pleased!",

I\u2019ve never been able to press DBs straight up like a circus event; I have glass shoulders for everything other than bench, Arnold press, strict press (weirdly) so I\u2019m mad impressed that you were able to have a good showing in static overhead AND dynamic events. \n\nAlso I love that winged eyeliner has become a strength sports thing.

I did use Mac bare study paint pot as sort of a base and then packed on each rainbow color with my fingers. Then just blended a tiny bit with my blending brush and set with the hourglass ambient lighting powder. With my mascara, I always apply top lashes first then only apply what's left on the bottom because I always struggle with lower mascara specks too.",

A game changer for me was only concealing on the darkness itself and not bringing the concealer thickly all under your eye area (like the influencer triangle!) where it\u2019s just going to settle into creases. Also dusting powder onto the under eye area to make the whole surface look \u2018flat\u2019 really helps with the dip that I have into my tear tracts.",

I also like knowing that the makeup is safe. Please don't buy just any cheap \"kids\" makeup, as it could contain harmful materials.",

My suggestion would to get him a palette from colourpop (possibly one of their 12 pans with lots of complimentary colours) and order a face paint palette from Amazon (the ones that come with two rows of colours) and some brushes.",

Also it\u2019s not pigmented and barely shows anything. Not good quality in many aspects. I don\u2019t care for kids makeup in that aspect. If a kid is getting interested in beauty and I don\u2019t want them to wear makeup for whatever personal reasons I may have, I\u2019d just get them tinted lip balm and some skincare. Some sheer face products like cream blush. Maybe even face gems. If you are concerned about having a child start using makeup (you don\u2019t seem to be at all btw just throwing this out there), then these would be my suggestions.",

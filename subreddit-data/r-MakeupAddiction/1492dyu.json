    "postText": "So I\u2019ve always wanted to be able to do natural makeup, the kind that you can do in 15 mins and look cute and glowy (I normally do either full face or none at all).\n\nHowever;\nI have super bad skin. Big pores, acne, sensitive, etc etc. Pregnancy changed it from being oily to a bit drier so I\u2019m now able to actually use moisturisers, serums, etc without getting greasy.\n\nMy problem is, I can\u2019t just do a thin bit of concealer or powder over primer because it just makes my skin look porous and dry. \n\nI need either some skin products that\u2019ll help with the pores, texture and redness, or just some new makeup techniques that might help.\n\nI currently use Aveeno calm &amp; restore products (only ones so far that don\u2019t break me out), and the Inkey retanol serum. Sometimes the neutrogena hydroboost products.\n\nMakeup wise, my go to foundations were either Fenty or Urban Decay all nighter. But since I got pregnant the Fenty one seems to look incredibly dry on me which is such a shame :(\n\nIf you read all of this, thankyou lol &lt;3",

No products with fragrance since you have sensitive skin\n\nA good gentle cleanser for sensitive skin.\n\nA hydrating moisturizer like CereVe or Vanicream.\n\nOils like jojoba and meadowfoam are wonderful for any skin type including oily. The skin loves them and it helps with dry patches or dryness.\n\nClear up the acne with Differen or work with a dermatologist, and use an excellent sunscreen. Korean brands are the best in the world and way cheaper than those in the US. Look via yesstyle and stylevanna.\n\nKeep your brushes and sponges clean so as not to perpetuate clogged pores. Dr Dray (board certified dermatologist on youtube) has tons of videos on products for every type of skin issue you can imagine. You have to find what works best for you.\n\nTo counter redness, you can use a green color correcting primer that diffuses pores as well. You'll need to read reviews to find those for sensitive skin\n\nColor corrector Product Options: Apply to Skin before foundation:\n\nEXA: High Fidelity Balancing Color Correctors\n\nErborian: CC Red Correct - Green color corrector\n\nGivenchy: Prisme Libre Skin-Caring Corrector\n\nClinique: Redness Solutions\n\nMake Up Forever: Primer Color Corrector - Redness Corrector\n\nNYX Studio Perfect Color Correcting Primers\n\nLanc\u00f4me Teint Idole Ultra Wear Camouflage Color Correctors\n\nCatrice Prime And Fine\n\nbareMinerals: Prime Time: Redness Reducing Primer\n\nCover FX: Stress Remedy Primer + Redness Relief\n\ne.l.f. Tone Adjusting Face Primer\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor techniques, look up Shelby Wilson, Nikki La Rose, Caroline Barnes and other makeup artists with tutorials on youtube. It always helps to actually **see** how product is applied.",

It can help with discolouration though.\nIf you say your skin is sensitive, use a good moisturiser for sensitive skin, vitamin E oil (sweet almond oil) helped my super sensitive skin recover. Use only at night over your moisturiser \n\nA quick make up no make up look- sheet masks for your skin type! Does wonders. Use the night before or the same day, apply sunscreen (if day time) then thin layer of foundation and some mascara",

Peels would be best for acne and texture once your barrier is healthier. \n\nCharcoal and clay is best if you have oily acne skin :) because it can be very drying esp if already have dry skin\nLook for masks with ingredients like aloe, Allantoin and chamomile extract. Or any fragrance free products that are made for sensitive skin. \n\nI stopped scrubs and exfoliating for months until my skin was more \u2018settled\u2019 \nI\u2019ve noticed products with lavender caused me to breakout even though it was \u201ccalming ingredient\u201d. So sometimes there can be a bit of trial and error in finding what works best for you :) \n\nDrugstore foundation for sensitive skin - Almay. \nIt\u2019s light weight and also build-able if you want full coverage as well.",

However, some concealer and a tinted moisturizer or lighter coverage foundation can look really nice! It won\u2019t hide texture but it goes a long way for evening out your skin but is still a little lighter than a full face glam kind of look. Samantha Ravandahl has some videos on this. She previously did lots of full coverage kind of looks and then switched to mostly lighter looks a few years ago.",

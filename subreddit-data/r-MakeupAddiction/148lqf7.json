I\u2019ve got a good makeup look that works for me, but im definitely no pro!\n\nOf course, I feel like my face looks completely different without glasses and am realizing I need to adjust from my daily routine if I need to take off my glasses (ie- passport photo) so I\u2019m wondering- what do you do differently on days you wear glasses and days you don\u2019t?\n\nTIA",

When I wear glasses, I usually do a winged liner and maybe light lashes. When I wear contacts, I only wear mascara and/or lashes on my eyes since they look bigger already. I suppose with a positive prescription, it would be the reverse",

Part of that is just not liking them hanging in my face, though,",

So, I've developed a makeup routine that works equally well for glasses/no glasses. Here are some of the things I've learned:\n\n1. If you use setting powder on your face, powder the nose piece of the glasses (and anywhere they touch your face) just a little bit with your translucent setting powder so they don't stick to your face/mess up your makeup/leave as much of a mark when removing.\n2. Wearing glasses takes some of the lift off your eyebrows to frame your face so pay careful attention to your brows on days you don't wear glasses. When not wearing glasses, make sure you brush/define/fill your brows (even if subtly) to frame your face. You may not be used to doing this as much when you wear glasses because they give instant browline.\n3. My lashes are very straight so curling them before mascara helps them *not* hit the inside of the glasses when I blink. (I don't like to skip mascara altogether because, again, taking them off throughout the day.)\n4. I do most of my eye makeup the same regardless of how much I'll be wearing my glasses, except for eyeliner. If I think I'll be wearing them *less* in the course of the day I will do eyeliner on my lids with a wing; if I think I will have my glasses on *more* during the day I might keep liner to just the tightline since the glasses are already adding interest in the eye area.\n5. A bold lip works equally well with/without glasses so I make that part of my signature makeup look.",

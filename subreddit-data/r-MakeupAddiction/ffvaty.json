They claim that their creation only took them an hour or whatever, when they actually spent all day on it. I saw some people giving you shit, and they can go fuck themselves. \n\nCertainly if you did this everyday you\u2019d be more efficient at it, but props to you for putting in the hours + effort to try something new and do it well.

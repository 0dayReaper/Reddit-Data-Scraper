I\u2019ve known people who it changes how old they look in a negative way, and people who it changes their facial shape in an unflattering way. \n\nDon\u2019t hold on to long hair just because you\u2019re scared you\u2019ll miss it, but you can explore what short hair will look like on you before you lop it all off.",

Using heat products doesn\u2019t take fifty two years to do my entire head anymore. It air dried within TWO HOURS yesterday! Usually it took 5! \n\nDo it. And then you get to play with all the fun in between growth stages of growing it out again if you so wish.",

What you're doing with the line down is creating a point, a kitty nose, where as deer just have a boxy shaped one, the black mouth blends into the nose (on real deer) and you cant really differentiate between the mouth and the nose on most pictures. Other than that super on point.",

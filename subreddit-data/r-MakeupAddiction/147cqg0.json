As always, buy/use the products that make YOU happy. Also, none of my stuff is sponsored nor quid pro quo. I do it for fun. NO edits or filters are ever used in any of my posts. \n\n...... \n\n\ud83d\udd3a\ufe0f PALETTE: Natasha Denona - Retro Glam Eyeshadow Palette \u270c \n\n...... \n\n\ud83d\udd3a\ufe0f ACQUIRED: purchased myself \n\n...... \n\n\u2b50 specific review requests and feedback are greatly welcomed (and appreciated!) \n\n...... \n\n\ud83d\udd3a\ufe0f SELECTION RATIONALE: I JUST got this palette from Ipsy, so I HAVE to try it! Truth be told - a pink + green-based color-story is my least-favorite vibe, but not totally unworkable. I mostly wanted to see how well this palette performed, as I've not always had the absolute best experience with ND in the past. \n\n...... \n\n\ud83d\udc41 LOOK CREATED: 'Contrast' \n\n...... \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f PACKAGING &amp; DESIGN: 1.28g of shadow per pan, square-shaped pans, custom plastic casing packaging, bi-fold, palette name &amp; brand is on cover, luxe-weight, magnetic closure system, rectangular-shaped, large-sized mirror inside, pans ARE removable with a magnet (and accessible through a pinhole on the back), shade nomenclature is designated conveniently southwards of each shade \n\n\ud83d\udd0a NOTICE: \n+ measuring in at 1.28g of shadow each, the pans contain ABOVE the average amount of product. I don't think anybody would find difficulty in storing this palette. [1/1pt] \n\n...... \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: Italy \n\n...... \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f TOTAL # OF SHADES: 15 (all eyeshadows, which are deemed safe by the FDA for use around the eye area). Upon further evaluation, NONE of the included shades stained my skin. \n\n...... \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f FORMULA BREAKDOWN [according to my observation]: 5 unique formulas\n+ (4) cream mattes\n+ (3) mattes\n+ (1) metallic sparkle\n+ (4) metallics\n+ (3) shimmers \n\n//////////////////// \n\nOfficially, this palette (as professionally described) has: 4 unique formulas\n+ (1) cream matte\n+ (6) mattes\n+ (7) metallics\n+ (1) sparkling \n\n...... \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f COLOR-STORY DESIGNATION: 'pink + green' \n\n...... \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f DEXTERITY CONCERNS: none \n\n...... \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f DESCRIPTION OF SHADE PRESS: soft; recommend doing EYES FIRST to avoid ruining your base makeup with fall-out \n\n...... \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f EXTRA PERTINENT INFORMATION: part of Natasha Denona's 'midi-sized' series, combines the Mini Retro palette with Glam palette finishes, ALL new-to-brand shades \n\n...... \n\n\u2705 ROUTINE DATA CHECK: \n+ not clarified to be 'clean' or 'conscious'\n+ cruelty-free \n+ NOT vegan\n+ 24-month PAO (located on palette) \n\n...... \n\n\ud83d\udd0d COST EVALUATION: (ulta beauty) \n+ \ud83d\udcb2 $69.00 / palette \n+ \ud83d\udcb2 $4.60 / shade \n+ \ud83d\udcb2 $3.58 / gram \n\n...... \n\n\u2666\ufe0f PRICE PER SHADE SCALE: \n\n+ &lt;$0.50=excellent; $1-$2=affordable; $3-$5=high; $6-$10=too expensive; &lt;$11=very expensive \n\n\u2666\ufe0f PRICE PER GRAM SCALE: \n\n+ very.affordable&lt;$2.00(avg)&lt;very.expensive \n\n\u2022 Comparing this palette to similar products available on the market, the price-per-shade is 'HIGH'. Additionally - this palette has a relatively 'EXPENSIVE' cost-per-gram, as compared to other palettes I've previously reviewed. [0/1pt] \n\n......",

            "comment": "COMMENT 3:\n--------------------- \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ufe0fPACKAGING: \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f I LOVE this type of packaging! I know I always say it, but it's the best for prolonged protection of the soft, fragile shadows inside. I DO feel as if the imagery/coloring further carries the palette's theming. \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f The backside of this palette does NOT contain all of the necessary information one would need to know about its contents. In this situation, the exterior box WOULD need to be retained in order to have all of the data present. \n\n\u25aa\ufe0f I do think that this packaging is a satisfactory representation of the brand (Natasha Denona) as this packaging is completely on-brand, and relatable to other palettes being offered (or having been offered). I DO think that the exterior cover design is an adequate indication of what to expect for the interior color-story. The cover's color theming contains hues of pink + green, leading me to believe I would see those shades on the inside. The shades experienced on the inside are exactly as expected. [1/1pt] \n\n...... \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ufe0fCOMMENTARY: alright, so this was much more impressive than ANY other Natasha Denona palette I've used before. I used just about every shade in this palette, and LOVED them. I prefer the secondary look (moreso how I'd actually wear it), but it's also quite versatile in its ability to create fun contrast upon the eye. \n\nLooking at this palette LOGICALLY and analyzing it through standardized measures, it scores ABOVE AVERAGE. The analysis breakdown proves that this palette is a stand-out in my collection. \n\nFrom an EMOTIONAL standpoint, this is by FAR the best (and least challenging) pink + green color-story I've come across. I actually don't hate it. I don't think this is a palette that I'll return to for elaborate looks, but as a simple, few-shade creative - it's damn good. \n\nToday, the look I created was simply a contrast eye, playing hard on the pink + green. These shades are usually very challenging for me to pair together nicely, so I like to boldly place them next to one another for a statement look. I also chose to focus on the metallics in this look, and love the end result. \n\nI'm giving this palette an 'A'-rating, as its logical analysis concludes it is a palette of superb magnitude - I REALLY had a great experience. \n\n...... \n\n\u25aa\ufe0fFINAL THOUGHTS: \n+ no eye prep necessary for best blends\n+ very expensive palette\n+ plenty of interesting formulas \n\n...... \n\n+ Favorite Shade: flutter\n- Least Favorite Shade: maxi \n\n...... \n\n\ud83d\udea6 RATING: A \n\n\u25ab\ufe0f\u25aa\ufe0f[points = 9/10] \n\n...... \n\n\u2b50 RATING LEGEND:\n+ A (9/10) = on par with my benchmark products\n+ B (7/8) = pretty good, but has some flaws\n+ C (5/6) = more factual cons than justified pros\n+ D (3/4) = this didn't work out for me\n+ F (0/1/2) = I totally hate this \n\n...... \n\nOTHER EYE MAKEUP USED TODAY:\n+ Kate Somerville - +Retinol Firming Eye Cream\n+ Maybelline - Total Temptation Brow Definer (305 soft brown) \n+ Florence by Mills - Tint N' Tame Brow Gel (clear)\n+ Revlon - Photoready Candid Antioxidant Concealer (020 bisque)\n+ NARS - Tinted Smudge-Proof Eyeshadow Base (medium dark)\n+ m2\u00fc NYC - Luminizer (mermaid tears)\n+ Maybelline - Fit Me!

I found this formula to work EXACTLY THE SAME in both situations. In this particular case, there is NOT an added strategic benefit of using any sort of eye base (and furthermore setting it). \n\n\u27a1\ufe0f if you are planning to use this palette, you definitely don't need to waste your time in fully prepping the eye area. You will achieve the best possible blends and maximum impact on a simple bare eye. \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ufe0fKICK-BACK/FALL-OUT: \n\n+ I DID experience quite a bit of kick-back from all shades\n+ the WORST fall-out was from the metallic sparkle - and this contains loose mica, which is particularly destructive to a makeup look \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ufe0fCOLOR-STORY CRITIQUE: \n\n\u2022 the range in this palette is SATISFACTORY - it contains light options, midtones, and some depth. This palette serves approximately THREE options to satisfy depth (between matte &amp; non-matte), which greatly enhances its versatility [1/1pt] \n\n\u2022 as far as shade redundancy - I did NOT come across ANY shades in this palette that looked or applied in a strikingly similar fashion. Each shade is very unique and serves a different purpose. I DO feel that each one of these shades warrant a spot in this particular color-story [1/1pt] \n\n\u2022 the formula balance ratio in this palette is 7:8 (mattes to non-mattes), &amp; I think a 47% / 53% formula split leans particularly 'well-balanced'. I prefer either 'well-balanced' layouts, OR 'matte-heavy' layouts, so this formula layout definitely DOES suit my typical preference [1/1pt] \n\n\u2022 I consider this palette to be a 'pink + green' color-story, and I say that because that's legitimately the foundation of this palette. A few neutrals are thrown in, and looks can be swayed either way \n\n\u2022 there is NOT a matte black in this palette. A matte black can make any shade truly universal, plus it's exemplary for grounding any eye look. I DON'T expect to see a matte black in smaller palettes like this (&lt;/=15 shades) \n\n\u2022 I did NOT come across a 'dud' shade while I was working with this palette. I thought each shade performed perfectly well within its base formulation \n[1/1pt] \n\n\u2022 there is NOT any decorative stamping on the included shadows \n\n...... \n\n\ud83d\udd38\ufe0fFORMULA HIGHLIGHTS: \n\n// \n\n\ud83d\udd39\ufe0f | MATTES |: \n+ easy, single-shade faded blends (NO base necessary) [1/1pt]\n+ NOT all the mattes ARE created equal - some are EXTRA smooth and creamy \n+ gradient builds ARE possible with this color selection \n+ the blend between shades WAS what I would consider to be 'flawless'\n+ NO trouble with layering and building the mattes\n+ this is a more 'buildable' formula (in lieu of being 'directly pigmented'), so you are going to notice having to add additional layers to really build up the pigment. Formulas like this can be easier to manage and control \n\n// \n\n\ud83d\udd39\ufe0f | NON-MATTES |: \n+ NO special effect shades included \n+ (1) 'metallic sparkle' shade has a very SHEER base, but is buildable\n+ some 'metallics' contain loose mica particles that DO fall-out\n+ all relative formulas have similar intensities, providing for a RELIABLE level of shine\n+ attempted all application methods (finger, dry brush, damp brush) - you can easily use ANY method with full confidence, however a DAMP BRUSH will provide the most impact \n\n......",

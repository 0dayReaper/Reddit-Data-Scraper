    "postText": "Hi! I have never been a full coverage girl but due to recent severe acne and Accutane redness I am starting. I have just bought the L\u2019oreal infallible 24h fresh wear foundation. What is the best way to apply it for non cakey, long lasting application? I am going to use the elf green sticky primer and elf setting spray. Is a beauty blender sponge optimal? Foundation brush? I have also had successes with powder puffs in the past with liquid foundation. I will also be using the fit me powder to set. TIA!",

            "comment": "I have the same foundation and find that a sponge will shear it out, as with any other foundation. If you want high impact coverage it\u2019s generally much easier to do with a dense brush. Ive never tried applying a liquid foundation with a powder puff but that could be worth a try if it has worked for you before. \n\nPersonally i use a flat top kabuki brush to apply all my foundations, and for this one it gives a wonderful medium-full coverage depending on how much i apply. I dont have any issues with it being cakey, but it is worth noting that it can cling awkwardly to dryness sometimes. I also set with a fluffy brush and a pressed powder after applying foundation and then go in with the rest of my base products and then set again with a powder puff on my t-zone (i tend to be more oily) and this keeps everything in place all day. \n\nSorry for the long reply, the last note i have is actually about how i go about covering my breakouts (i did this today using this foundation and it works like a charm). For bigger blemishes i like to take a little fountain on the back of my hand and use a small fluffy brush (like one for eyeshadow) to buff the foundation over it, and then use a similar brush (or the same one) to intentionally set the foundation in that area with a setting powder. It boosts the coverage just in that area so ur entire face doesnt look like it has a ton of foundation on it and the color match obviously is exact bc ur just using the same product. This lets me do a medium coverage all over and full coverage just in the important areas, its more breathable that way and less cakey. Setting with an extra bit of powder of course sets the makeup down but you don\u2019t have to go overboard on powder on the whole face just to make sure the few full coverage spots are set. \n\nHope this really drawn out answer helps some :D good luck on ur acutane journey!",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve been using the typology tinted serum but it seems overpriced. However, I\u2019m having a very hard time figuring out what else would work.\n\nI\u2019m looking for something that is\n1. safe for acne prone skin (I see lots with oil ingredients which im hesitant to try)\n2. Light coverage- no-makeup-looking, just to even out my skin tone a little and maybe add a little glow. \n3. Lasts without changing color?? I keep seeing reviews for various tints that sounds great in every other way (fenty, neutragena, morphe) but ppl claim they turn orange?\n4. Easy to apply - I looked into rose inc and Mac f&amp;b which both sound great overall but seem tricky to apply correctly according to reviews\n\nIf anyone has recommendations or has tried one of the ones I mentioned and im wrong about it pls let me know, it would be super appreciated!",

It's very thin and liquidy and dries to a natural, very slightly matte finish. I don't feel it on my face after it's dried. \n\nIt's decently easy to apply but I wouldn't do it with your fingers. Use a sponge or a brush. Either works fine but fingers will streak.",

    "postText": "I got invited to quite a few weddings this summer and I haven\u2019t work foundation in years. I want to wear makeup and I\u2019m looking for preferably a drugstore foundation since I don\u2019t live near any makeup stores (small town problems). I have combination skin with a t zone that gets really oily. I need something that will last me the whole day. Also I would appreciate powder suggestions too!",

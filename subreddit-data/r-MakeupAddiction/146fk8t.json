This is why portrait photography usually uses 85mm lenses because it's the closest to real life with minimal facial feature distortion.\n\n\nGo to Google images and type in \"focal length face\" and check out the differences, there's some pretty revealing examples showing how stark the difference in appearance is \n\n\nYou can try this on yourself to an extent with your phone camera! Take a selfie up close (you'll notice your features almost have a mild fish-eye lens effect) and then take one from far away but ZOOMED in with your camera zoom so that the amount of face in the photo roughly matches how much face was in the previous one. You'll notice your features appear more normal like what you see in the mirror, from temple to temple your face will appear much broader, etc.\n\n\nTL;DR focal length distorts your face and makes a massive difference in appearance",

Then I used a sponge to pick up any excess bronzer I didn\u2019t like on my bridge and set it with translucent powder. \n\nThe other big difference; I don\u2019t highlight the whole nose bridge anymore, just the top and the tip of my nose.

Bought the maybelline concealer with the little sponge in my skin tone (the lasy said that it would be better since I don\u2019t want to use foundation). What are your opinions on the formula? Also, how should I apply? I\u2019m a bit embarassed to use it tbf hahah",

I dot on a tiny bit in the inner corner of my eye and blend with my ring finger outward with a patting motion. I like it natural so I use a couple of very light coats and I put a small amount on my eyelids as well to remove the redness. Then I let it sit for 10 minutes before I powder my face but that part is optional. Good luck!",

I really loved their master conceal concealer that they recently discontinued, that one was so good and skin-like. It needed a much wider shade range though. Honestly I do not understand why one went viral and the other was so much better but never took off and got expanded. EDIT: Apparently it didn't get discontinued, a lot of ppl just thought it was last year. It disappeared off shelves where I live so I dunno, maybe just a problem with supply.",

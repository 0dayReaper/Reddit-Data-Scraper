    "postText": "I will try to keep this as concise as possible, but please read the entire post - I am *not* just asking the more simple question of \"base or eyes first!\" \n\nI'm a drag performer who has been doing my current \"look\" for a little over a year now, but trial and error still has me wondering if anyone else has some advice for me.\n\nMy looks almost always involve A LOT of black liquid liner, usually some sort of intricate combination of spikes and/or jagged lines that emanate from my eyes and extend beyond them to my cheeks/sides of my face (think drag meets metal corpse paint). As of right now, I currently do my base first and then eyeliner on top, but I have some difficulty getting my eyeliner to work properly while I have foundation underneath: it's not as black and the lines are not as clean as what I can achieve on bare or just primed skin with the same eyeliner. I've tried setting and not setting my base as well and still get mediocre (for my standards) results. The intricacy of the lines and the area they occupy is what prevents me from regularly doing my eyes first and base second, but I wanted to know if anyone has suggestions for how to work around the problems I'm having with my base first approach.\n\nFor reference, I use some pretty cheap felt tip/stamp eyeliners I got on Amazon that work really well for me on bare/primed skin. I use these because of the amount of eyeliner I use for each look. I use various water based liquid foundations and good ol Coty airspun to set.",

I feel this will give you much more control and will get around your issues quite effectively. Plus it\u2019s usually longer lasting. I haven\u2019t used any in a long while but Inglot used to make a great pot gel liner.",

I usually use the Makeup Forever pencils in a shade that\u2019s the slightest bit deeper than my skintone so that I can easily rub it off if I mess up\u2026their pencils are pretty blendable and forgiving too. If you\u2019re doing a lot of thinner intricate lines, you could get a set of nail brushes and the kind of liner you can dip into\u2026..I feel like the thin, long, flexible type of brushes kinda do the work for you once you get the hang of them.",

I\u2019m not sure if they still make the one I love (I stocked up on it and it does not take a lot of product to do what I\u2019m doing) but it was $12 and amazing. Only downside is that it isn\u2019t waterproof so if you sweat a lot I wouldn\u2019t use it there. Sorry this isn\u2019t more helpful but I think brush tip products that dip into a well will come out darker than felt tip/pens jn my experience!",

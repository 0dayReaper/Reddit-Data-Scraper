    "postText": "Hello, I am from India, I have made the same post on Indian makeup sub but didn't get any answers so I am posting here as well.\n\nSo my sister's wedding would be held this year end. She is from US and I want her to buy base makeup from US. She is a completely new to it and I have self taught medium level knowledge and a good collection of makeup brands from India so I have asked her to get atleast base makeup stuff from sephora, matched there by the staff. For engagement and marriage MUAs have been hired, for other ceremonies I would be her MUA. \ud83d\ude02\n\nThough I lack in-depth knowledge about the brands from US, I have listed two things for recommendations, I need your views:\n\n**&gt; Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer**\n\nI was torn between Tarte and this and through research I found this to be more preferred. Please give opinion on this.\n\n**&gt;Fenty Beauty Eaze Drop skin tint (For foundation)**\n\nShe doesn't like heavy makeup, thus, I am thinking of suggesting this instead of foundation. Though would suggest her to get Fenty Beauty foundation only if her shade doesn't match for the tint.Do you have any better recommendation?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe has oily t-zone, acne prone skin. Not much texture/pores visible, acne scars a bit of them, yes. Medium dark circles. Please let me know your views, if you have any experience with these products. Also for recommendations I think the budget these products come in would be fine. Anything above, more lux would be a waste tbh, not sure if she is going to use much of it after ceremonies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.s. - This query is for me but can anyone suggest like dupe of [GXVE BY GWEN STEFANI Line It Up](https://www.sephora.com/product/gxve-by-gwen-stefani-line-it-up-clean-24-hr-gel-pencil-waterproof-eyeliner-P482000?om_mmc=aff-linkshare-redirect-x9A7w7fjzpE&amp;c3ch=Linkshare&amp;c3nid=x9A7w7fjzpE&amp;affid=x9A7w7fjzpE-0mFf62pXzgASU7uXvx.Ayw&amp;ranEAID=x9A7w7fjzpE&amp;ranMID=2417&amp;ranSiteID=x9A7w7fjzpE-0mFf62pXzgASU7uXvx.Ayw&amp;ranLinkID=10-1&amp;browserdefault=true&amp;skuId=2568137) eyeliner? Indian/US brand, any would do, this looks so stunningly intensely black but seems too expensive(20$).",

I recommend the Bare Minerals Pro Liquid Foundation to everyone because it's so gentle on skin and gives full coverage with a matte finish. You can also add a bit of liquid highlighter &amp;/ moisturizer to it (blends well in your hand) if you want to change the finish to be a little more sheer or glowy.",

            "comment": "The Tarte shape tape feels kinda dry for me (even though I have oily skin and no concerns over fine lines yet). It shows my skin texture and gets caked up if I try to do more layers. If she's got combo skin with acne concern, sheer tints are probably make it until the end of the day. I might try a medium coverage foundation with natural-semi matte finish. \n\nI would check out Mac's studio fix fluid foundation. It has medium coverage semi-matte finish, lightweight &amp; buildable (great for spot concealing acne marks). Mac has their own stand alone store, but she can always walk in to any store that carries Mac and get matched (Belk, Dillards, Macy's, Nordstrom, Ulta etc.)",

If you\u2019re worried about lines, good eye moisturiser then add a tiny bit of concealer. \nApply in such a way that your eye is in position/angle that brings out the least wrinkle when applying. \nCreasing also happens when there\u2019s too much product. \nWatch some YouTube videos on creasing they might help further.",

Like one or two shades. And two, you are wearing your wig way too far forward. You have a beautiful forehead. And a dome forehead is very feminine and flattering. Try pulling your wig back to your natural hair line, and contouring your forehead like RuPaul does. I do the same technique and it\u2019s beautiful. That\u2019s all, otherwise you are gorgeous! \ud83d\udc8b\ud83c\udf08",

I\u2019m waiting for my Aunt to come get me, I\u2019m taking this seriously and I\u2019m scared but she\u2019s going to come with me to get checked out. \n\nI\u2019m really embarrassed, I didn\u2019t mean to draw attention to myself other than getting a few makeup  tips and I didn\u2019t think so many people would see these pics. I wish I hadn\u2019t posted but I\u2019m also glad I did because I had no idea this could be anything more than a regular black eye (eyes?) \n\nI\u2019m really thankful for all of the kindness and concern from y\u2019all, I didn\u2019t pick up my phone for a long time because I didn\u2019t want to know or think of anything. \n\nI\u2019ll get back to all of the sweet DMs and y\u2019all\u2019s helpful comments and makeup advice (Edit: and medical wisdom!) and encouragement, I promise. \n\nThank you all again and I\u2019ll post back, it\u2019s overwhelming but I\u2019ll post an update when I can.

Most people have heard of fight-or-flight, but there's also freeze (as well as fawn). Freeze is my usual go-to response, in situations similar to yours (not picking up the phone, etc.). A lot of times, it feels like avoidance. I even often unwillingly delay reading responses to posts I've made, answering phone calls &amp; texts, looking at mail, listening to voicemails, making routine phone calls (like to make appointments). \n\nTry not to feel bad or beat up on yourself when this happens  (easier said than done I know). Try and be as gentle and kind to yourself as you can. Do things that calm &amp; comfort you, even if it's something little like blowing bubbles or holding a teddy bear.\n\nI'm rooting for you - wish you all the best. \u2764\ufe0f",

I also know the reality that this job interview might be your ticket out and you still want/need to do it. Remember that the order of importance is: personal/physical safety -&gt;important documents -&gt; somewhere to stay/food to eat -&gt; the ability to live long term. \n\nThat being said, only use the makeup to hide it if it's for YOUR safety or YOUR freedom. These skills are not for his safety or protection, or to hide things from others. Abusers thrive in secret. He doesn't need to know you have these skills. \n\nYou're going to want to go opposite the bruise color - yellow/peach/green color corrector depending on what color it is that day (it will change). There are little kits with multiple colors. Go in thin layers, and put a thin layer of concealer over it. Use bronzer - it will warm up areas that appear gray after the color correcting. Then a glowier foundation. Set it with a slightly glowy powder (like the ELF one). \n\nFor your eyes, you can lean into it a bit - a thicker liner can help (but still professional - no big wings). Stick to black/brown for the eyes, anything pink or purple is going to emphasize redness. I had a weird eye problem a few months ago, and found that a smudgy eyeliner and a darker crease shade helped disguise similar eyelid issues. Then use a glowier shade on the center of the lid. Make sure your eyebrows are neat - draw the attention up and away from the under eye, or down and toward the lips.\n\nA good bronzer/blush should help draw attention away - use warmer colors so it doesn't bring out the blue/red tones. Don't go overboard - this should be professional. \n\nMaybe a coral lip - with lots of shine. PUt the focus on your lips so the eye area is less obvious. Go warm and structured - use a lip liner.  Grab some makeup remover wipes so you can take it all off before you get home.\n\nI hope this is your ticket out. If it is not - if you don't get the job, run (or just go directly to the hospital). DV centers can connect you with other jobs. While you're out at the interview, if you have a few dollars, get a burner phone (I think Walmart has them) and put it in your go bag with your important documents and a few changes of clothing. If it's this bad this time, how bad will it be next time? I'm concerned because this injury shows a pattern of escalation. It will continue to escalate. You're at the point where you need to get out before he kills you.",

Finding the \"opposite\" color this way --red's opposite is green, for example-- is the most precise way to neutralize discoloration. \n\nfor additional coverage (even works great on eyelids) i recommend tarte shape tape concealer; either the normal formula or the hydrating formula depending on whether you're dry or oily. it comes in less expensive mini tubes as well, check ulta. finally, after all this concealing, don't forget about a pop of blush to return some color to the face.\n\ngood luck with everything",

This palette was a life saver. Plus it has all the colours so as my bruises faded I could still cover them up. Also great for acne spots, extreme hangovers, or scarring.\n\nI hope you find some healing. I really really REALLY hope you get the job.

If it's virtual, you have a bit more flexibility with things like the room lighting. You can test how you'll appear on screen with your makeup, different settings, and different lighting ahead of time.\n\nVirtually or in person, glasses - real, blue light, or otherwise - with larger, thicker frames could also help mask the appearance. Setting your makeup is critical if you go this route, because the last thing you want is your makeup rubbed off by the glasses. If you have time, do a test run today to make sure it works as intended. \n \nI saw you mentioned something about a limited budget. Due to the extenuating circumstances, I was going to suggest buying dermablend from a place that has a generous return policy. That doesn't sit well with me, so instead, I'd like to ask if I can Venmo you a little bit of cash to help ease the financial burden. Maybe others here would be willing to pitch in as well. Totally understandable if you don't want to accept this kind of help if it might potentially aggravate your situation. \n\nGood luck tomorrow! We're all rooting for you.\ud83d\udc97",

But this is a **right now** situation.  \n\nYou might just have a skull fracture, that heals on its own. But when you have a fracture you often have bleeding in other compartments that you may not feel bc we don\u2019t sense pain there. And they can get bigger until they are putting pressure on the rest of your brain and this causes ppl to get confused and very sick. If you\u2019re bleeding in compartments, that\u2019s a very fixable problem, as long as you catch it early.  you can\u2019t wait to get confused. \n\nA lot of times women in DV situations also don\u2019t want to go to the ER bc they\u2019re worried they\u2019ll have to report to police and get in more trouble at home. You are an adult, you do not have to report to the police. \n\nIf you are worried about money, that\u2019s reasonable, but there\u2019s financial aid available at most hospitals- ask about it AFTER you get seen. Go to the ER. Call 911 or a friend or just go. Please, go now.",

After receiving medical care, focus on getting help for your home life situation. The ER probably has resources they can direct you to. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable asking them about it, you can use this tool to find a local women\u2019s shelter: https://www.thehotline.org/get-help/domestic-violence-local-resources/\n\nWomen\u2019s shelters will provide transitional housing assistance, so you can take your time to look for a stable job. Many also help with the interview/application process or at least have connections to other nonprofits who do. \n\nI say this not because it is easy- I know it is so hard to escape these situations for so many reasons that none of us can fully understand. But please know there are people who care deeply about your well-being and want you to be safe and happy. \n\nPlease reach out if you need anything. But first, seek out medical attention.",

It can look cakey after a bit but it will get the job done, then use the most opaque foundation u have and some translucent powder to keep it down, it might look like alot so a dewy finishing spray might take away from the cakey look if u like dewy finishes, and then id add some white highligter or shimmery eyehadow in the inner corner of ur eyes to make them look brighter. Best of luck, hope u get the job and hope you'll be doing better soon \u2764\ufe0f",

            "comment": "Hi friend.\n\nI know this will probably be buried, but I just want to share something really quickly. \n\nI lost my dad to suicide about 10 years ago. After, I fell into the deepest, darkest depression for a couple of years because I felt like it was my fault. He used to tell me if it weren\u2019t for me, he\u2019d kill himself. I distanced myself for my own mental health, and that\u2019s when he completed suicide. \n\nSo much happened that I won\u2019t share unless you\u2019d like to talk about it, but long story short: I got into an abusive relationship, probably because I had no sense of self-worth and honestly felt suicidal anyway. I knew the guy was messed up. I stayed for too long, until one day, he put his hands around my throat and wouldn\u2019t let go. By the grace of God, he let go because someone banged on the locked bedroom door. It was my chance to get away. \n\nI had bruises. Not this bad, but I remember wearing turtle necks to hide the swelling in my throat and discoloration. I went to the doctor (thankfully, no permanent damage). I fell deeper into a hole of despair, but I realized that I NEEDED help or I would end up back in that situation again, and the next time, I might not survive. \n\nYou are SO brave to know you have to get out. I am SO proud of you for being courageous enough to say, fuck these bruises, I\u2019m going to get myself back in the saddle despite my grief and my pain. I hope you see a doctor for the immediate injuries, but more than that, I hope you leave and NEVER go back to whoever did this to you. \n\nLosing your brother is not your fault, just like losing my dad wasn\u2019t mine. It took years to believe that, but I promise, if you get help (support groups saved me) you can liberate yourself too. It\u2019s so hard carrying around the kind of grief that suicide leaves us with. I promise it\u2019s not forever, and I promise that you deserve to live better than this. You deserve to know love, and support, and unconditional compassion, just as you gave your brother who undoubtedly left this world knowing\u2014if nothing else\u2014that he has a sister who would do anything for him. What a blessing that is, to know that kind of love. He would want you to give yourself that same love, too.\n\nThere is hope. This is not the end for you. This is the beginning of a brave new chapter where you can reinvent yourself into the person you deserve to be.  I know because I have been in your shoes, and yet today, I\u2019m happily married, expecting my first baby in a matter of weeks, and I just recently passed the bar exam. Im HAPPY. And, so so so loved and supported by the village that I found after those dark days. \n\nI am sending so much love and light, my friend. Please reach out if I can be of any support. Keep being brave. You\u2019ve got this.",

Budget makeup is so much better these days and the quality can be just as good as high end. Its worth checking out some youtube tutorials for covering bruises or marks etc.\n\nI would also advise you to use any local resources at your disposal. They are put in place to help people in your situation, you have been so strong already and deserve some help. Don't be afraid to use it.\n\nContact local DV centers, some of these places have makeup, clothes , shoes etc that can be borrowed specifically to help women get into work. They may also know of hair, beauty and dry cleaners that do free services or cheaper services. Often local students need models and will give discounted prices for colours and cuts or makeovers. Another resource might be local libraries, they often do free printing or help with CV's etc.\n\nTake care of yourself, stay safe and good luck with the interview I'm sure you will rock it.",

Here was my regimen:\n\nFirst few days (while still swollen):\n\n**AM &amp; PM**\n\n\\- Ice pack 20 min on/10 off for about an hour\n\n\\- Cover a cotton swab w/ Witch Hazel and apply for 5 minutes\n\n\\- Rub/Rest a pineapple chunk on under-eye for about 5 minutes \n\n\\- Apply Arnicare Bruise Cream\n\n\\- About 30 minutes later, apply DerMend Moisturizing Bruise Formula\n\n**MIDDAY**\n\n\\-Repeat but without Dermend (this product should only be used twice a day maximum)\n\nAfter the swelling went down, I switched to light heat compression/massaging in place of the ice packs, but would only do the warm compress for about 5 min on/5 min off for a couple of times. \n\nI ate a TON of pineapple, dark berries, and leafy greens, and honestly **once I started using the Dermend, it got SO much better**. It can be found at CVS or on Amazon. And make sure to HYDRATE. \n\nObviously, makeup is your friend, but don't forget we live in a world where wearing a facial mask is not absurd. I wore a mask to work and just told my co-workers I wasn't feeling 100%, no questions were asked. You could easily wear a mask to this interview and just let them know you were just exposed or you're not feeling totally great but you really wanted to make the interview!\n\nOk now - all of this being said - **please read the top upvoted comment by** u/Medical_Animal.

You may also want to go around the edges with a peachy colour. \nSet that with a tiny amount of powder. Then a thick foundation or if you already have a foundation you like try something like elf camo concealer just around the eye area (it's thicker and full coverage concealer) use a nice highlight in the inner corner to brighten the whole look up",

I say do the interview with no makeup, if you can, and focus on how you present yourself, non-visually. Given your current situation, I imagine that is much easier said than done, so if you do decide to cover, please proceed with caution.\n\nSecond, if you\u2019re gonna do makeup, call Sephora or Mac in your area if you have either, I\u2019m sure people on this sub have opinions about both brands, but, I know both have had programs in the past to help women in need.

If you have combination skin, Patrick Starrr\u2019s One/Size has a pretty good quality powder foundation and the coverage is buildable to full. I would keep the rest of your face makeup simple, just brows, blush, and lips for a polished/professional first impression. A tinted brow gel/pomade like Milani is a good drugstore product. For blush and lips, you can actually use a multipurpose tint or even lipstick. \n\nGood luck! Wishing you strength and healing!",

            "comment": "Since this is your first job interview in TEN years, that is rather exciting. Do you need any interviewing tips? Is it a zoom type interview or in person? I find it really helpful to look up interview questions and answers for the position you're applying for, a quick Google should help, and to go over them out loud. Also to write out any examples, some bullet points on why you're applying, what you know about the company, challenges you've overcome with others, something you're proud of accomplishing and how you did it, some strengths and weaknesses. Just some bullet points that you can't reflect on during the interview. If it's in person you can bring a folder with extra copies of your resume, and one for yourself and write the bullet points on your copy, or affix with sticky notes (you can check them during the interview unless they say otherwise, it's not cheating it shows that you are prepared and that you would be prepared on the job there!), you can also bring any copies of certificates, accomplishments (but only copies in case they went to keep them).  I also note down a couple questions I would ask them at the end of the interview, given they haven't already answered them (they can be more specific to your role, or generic like \"how is the team structured? How would you measure the success of this position? What are some sort term vs longer term goals for this position? What would you say your management style is? ) And then my last question is always, \"Given everything we have discussed, do you have any concerns about me filing this role?\" This question is hard to ask, but trust me, just do it. It usually throws them off guard and they can tell you right then and there any issues they see that you now have a chance to respond to and correct I have had a person say, \"we will ask discuss this and let you know blahblah\" but that is quite rare. They're usually helpful.\n\nAnd always be likable. I know this sounds silly, but when interviewees are nervous they can forget to keep things light. \"It's great to meet you\" laugh, smile, look like you like talking to them, and remember to thank them at the end!\n\nThose are pretty much the sum of my tips. I hope there was at least one tiny nugget of help in there for you. You have got this!!!",

After swatching it in store, make sure you step out in natural light before buying it. Also, if you can bring a friend to get their opinion.",

(In my case, since I don't live near enough to a Sephora et al to get matched in store, I have to pay a lot of attention to photos and swatches online, and add sample cards or mini sizes to my cart if I can.)\n\nFor matching, I prefer to match foundation from about my jawline down my neck a little ways, while others may prefer to match to just their neck or to their chest.",

What did she do to \"match\" you exactly? Did she use their **Color IQ** handheld camera against your skin? They just updated it a month ago.\n2. What foundation brand and shade were you matched with?\n\nThe process uses a simple handheld camera to capture your skin's shade, factoring in its unique depth, undertones, saturation, and skin type, while accounting for redness, freckles, or stray hair follicles.\n\nu/mizshellytee is correct. You do not need to \"buy\" the foundation. They will give you a sample if you go in and tell them you want to sample them before buying.\n\nAlso, you can get foundation swatched on your face in the store and then ask for a mirror to go outside the store to look at it dried on your face in natural sunlight.\n\nI would return the foundation with the receipt. Which drugstores, Ulta, etc will do even if you'v e used over 50 percent of the product. You just need to do it within their time frame for returns.\n\nSince you are Asian with a cool undertone, I recommend you get swatched with Makeup by Mario foundation. Don't judge by the appearance in the bottle, it looks completely different on the skin and is cool olive friendly. I know. I am one.\n\nWhat is the foundation you wear most now and what problems do you have with it?\n\nAlso, join the r/OliveMUA subreddit.",

I shake the setting spray, close my eyes, and spray across my eyes and then quickly at the rest of my face. Occasionally I\u2019ll get a little smear of mascara I have to wipe off after spraying, typically if it wasn\u2019t dry before I sprayed.",

Very little flaking, it is NOT waterproof, but does remove easily with water (it's a tubing mascara, so you wind up with odd black mascara bits instead of residue).",

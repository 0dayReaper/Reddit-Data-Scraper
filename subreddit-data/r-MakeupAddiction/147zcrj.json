            "comment": "Redhead here - purple blush. A light purple, or even a dark one. Easier to find a purple highlighter and use it as blush btw. I sometimes use eye pigment for blush. \n\nSpecific brands and products I use and love - \n\n(Danessa Myricks) Dew Wet Hydrating Highlighter in Holy Water (use your finger, best way to apply it)\n\n(Danessa Myricks) Vision Flush Blush in Black Cherry (a little goes a long way. I use 2 dots on each cheek and blend with a sponge) \n\n(MBA Cosmetics) Eclipse Highlighter in Celestial (the Aurora is also gorgeous over a purple blush, and is my current go to) \n\n(NotyceBeauty) Pressed Highlighter in Enma (not as sparkly as you might expect so it's not too much glitter. I feel it adds a nice glow) \n\nMorphe also sold purple blush and highlighter, but I felt as if they were more a pink than a purple. Especially when you blend them on your face, they turn out to look more pink. So I don't really recommend them (plus the brand is kinda sketch). But they're an okay way to see if you might like something more purple that you can also pick up at your local ulta today if you wanted to. \n\nI know it sounds like a lot, but it's such a beautiful addition to the pale skin and red hair! My hair is more redbrown than orange these days, but I do dye the tips and half of my bangs orange. The purple also compliments green eyes very well. You can also put a swipe of whatever highlighter you use over you eyelids for a more glowy look, I love that for my casual makeup (:",

Your skin is really bright and clear which is emphasized by the hair, so the current color of eyeshadow doesn\u2019t feel super cohesive. I love the no eyebrows btw, it\u2019s super flattering on you! I\u2019ve been shaving mine off completely for several years and it\u2019s so fun.",

Like if your going for an aesthetic change or find ways better ways the do your make up. \n\nFor blush, for a light blush look go for very light shapes of pink or coral. For more blush heavy looks use an red-ish orange lip gloss and play with the amounts you want to put on.",

A safer option is always the apple of your cheek but after trial and error I\u2019ve realised that sometimes what\u2019s the safest is honestly not that good also adding a tinyyyy bit of tint in the inner of your lips is a greAt addition to a natural lip look ,rly makes you look alive I recommend a peach or coral and always use a small amount buff it out then add more if needed,use soft moistened lips so make sure it doesn\u2019t stick in splotches and if u like a rly polished type then add a simple nude in your natural lip color or a baby pink underneath^^",

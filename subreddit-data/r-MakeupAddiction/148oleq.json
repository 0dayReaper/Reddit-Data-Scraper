I\u2019ve tried a few and I\u2019ve linked the swatches on my hand in comments below, hoping I did it correctly. \n\nMost people are swearing by Fenty\u2019s MVP as the best blueish red ever, but it looks orange on me. \n\nI\u2019ve brought two other brands that look more red: The Lip Bar\u2019s Bawse Lady and Beauty Bakerie\u2019s Cranberry Stilleto. Is there something I can do to color correct MVP, or did I waste my money? \ud83d\ude29",

I have so many of their shades and I put it on in the morning and go. The red one that\u2019s like mon Cherie I think it\u2019s more of a blue red in my opinion too!",

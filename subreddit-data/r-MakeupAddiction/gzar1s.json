This way you get a big dramatic wing with the shadow on the border and then depth with the black liquid liner. \nAnother thing I do that idk if I would recommend is blend my foundation and bronzer over my hairline. I wipe any makeup off my hair carefully after. I\u2019m a stickler about having imperceptible foundation and contouring. \n\nI also recommend using a mostly-finished mascara first to prime the lashes with just a little bit of mascara before applying your normal mascara. It layers so much better because the mostly empty mascaras wand can really get in between the lashes and get an even first coat with 0 clumps. \n\nUmmm what else ... \n\nI only line the outer half of my eyes to make them look bigger and more cat like. The wing starts elevating from when I start lining so it all points up.\n\nI hope these tips make sense and possibly help! Lmk if you need any clarification",

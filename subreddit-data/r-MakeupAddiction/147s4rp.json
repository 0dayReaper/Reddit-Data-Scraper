    "postText": "Hello, I'm looking into getting a matte lipstick for my upcoming wedding. I have heard good things about both CT and Mac for matte bullet lipsticks. I've seen more people like the formula of CT better but I can't find much on how they compare wear/longevity wise? As in does Mac last longer because of the more drying formula, or is it about the same? Thanks!",

Neither has been really drying and I have a preference for CT because it feels like it is a bit more nourishing for my lips. Hope this helps!",

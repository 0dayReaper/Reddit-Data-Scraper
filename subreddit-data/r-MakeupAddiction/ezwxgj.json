I wanted to know how much of an improvement to her shot she felt that the new light helped. I am not trying to take anything away from her makeup.

So although the difference in technique might still be seen (by someone who's not me), the difference in picture quality might introduce a subconscious bias and skew the answers you receive.\n\nHowever, since this is unlikely to be related to a double-blind medical experiment, it probably doesn't matter...I was just trying to help :)",

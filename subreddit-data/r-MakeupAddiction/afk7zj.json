I\u2019ll probably be making a video on my YT in the next few weeks showing this, just to clarify more if you\u2019re interested all?  \n\nSorry again for the lame response, but hope this helps a bit! xo",

No amount of highlighter can\u2019t save a cakey base\n\n- Blush to give the skin a natural sun kissed look. I actually worked the blush around the perimeters of my face too. If your complexion is similar to mine, I\u2019d deffo recommend a coral-toned blush :)\n\nBut a really natural looking highlighter obviously steals the spotlight. \n\nHope this helps \ud83e\udd70",

She could use the mattifier where she wants to control oil, and the hydrator everywhere else. This way she can alter her base makeup to suit her personal skin's needs.\n\nAlternatively, you could use one primer on spots where you need it, or combine multiple to address a variety of concerns.

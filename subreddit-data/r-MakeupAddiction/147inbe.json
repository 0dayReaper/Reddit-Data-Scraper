Not heavily tinted C. Scented preferably D. Not a gloss or lip oil E. No peppermint scent F. At least effective at being a lip balm\n\nPlease include flavours and scents in your comments, I am like a child that needs everything tasty \ud83d\ude2d",

They are all clear and don't vanish from your lips after a while. Not a big scent/flavour range but I found the lip balm itself to be very nice.",

I loved the Laneige lip sleep mask and this has a similar texture to me once it's on.  It feels so good. I love it like crazy. It's slightly tacky but less greasy than Vaseline if that helps. Watermelon one is clear but some of the other flavors have a very slight tint. Can be ordered on Amazon or Catrice website",

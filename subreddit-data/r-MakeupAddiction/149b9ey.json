As for makeup definitely opt for waterproof it always stays longer with little to no smudging. Also I\u2019ve noticed the camera sometimes washes makeup out, so I recommend actually go a little bolder than you usually do. Eyeliner (kvd liquid), too face better than s*x (waterproof mascara), it cosmetics (CC cream) or fenty (foundation), ardell falsies (deluxe pack wispies)",

I have always used a darker and lighter shade concealers for contour, and recommended it highly to anyone who says they have always failed at contouring attempts. At about 14-15 I had gained some weight and was self conscious about my softened jawline. I went to use new foundation one day and started on my neck, it looked a little dark for my skin tone, but I was short on time, so I just switched to my lighter foundation for my face. It was a close match initially, but oxidized darker. The day went on, I couldn't help but notice that my jawline didn't have the soft look I had grown used to looking at. I even weighed myself when I got home that afternoon because I honestly thought I had lost a few pounds without noticing!  (I had an unhealthy relationship with weight and body image at that point in my life. Thanks Mom!)\n\nI didn't know that what I had done was essentially contouring, but when I figured out that it was an illusion caused by the shade difference, I used that foundation on my neck until the bottle ran out!\n\nI eventually switched to concealer, as they don't oxidize the same way foundations can, stay in place, and their thicker consistency gives better control. I have tried TONS of actual contour products though, and have yet to find one that has actually looked even half as good as my \"contouring concealers\" and I'm a cosmetologist who does hair AND makeup.",

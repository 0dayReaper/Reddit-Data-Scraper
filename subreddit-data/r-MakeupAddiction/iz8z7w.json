I imagine it goes faster when you're doing it everyday and not having to explain what you're doing as you're doing it. Even still, that's like 30-45 minutes in a chair every day just doing shaping and contouring and getting all your lines right. Not to mention the crazy cost of high end cosmetics.\n\nAll the power to men and women who like to glam up with a high end look, but I am too damn impatient. I imagine taking that much makeup off at the end of the day feels like taking off your socks and boots at the end of the day where you just feel a weight off you.",

I was in my 20s when I realised women wear make-up for themselves, not for men, and can and should wear it however the hell they like.  \nWhether it's as an avenue to express yourself, or to feel more secure, or just to feel good, I think it's awesome.\n\nA lot of us, as a jaunt through this comments will reveal, are still immature or ignorant about a thing roughly half the population do, and stuff like this and discussions around it can change people's perceptions. I'm also curious, if #3 could \"pass\" as a natural face to other women/make-up wearing men?  Other than maybe the eyebrows and lashes, I don't think I could tell there's make-up.",

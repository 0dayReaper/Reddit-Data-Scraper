    "postText": "My everyday makeup routine usually just consists of filling in my eyebrows. I have very fair eyebrows but I have a lot of eyebrow hairs. Whenever I fill in my brows, I try to make it look as natural as possible. I like to think they do but sometimes it\u2019s just too much work for me, especially when I\u2019m getting ready to go to work or class. I hate doing my eyebrows because it seems like the shape is always changing and ends up changing my whole face. I go thread my eyebrows every time they overgrow so they can have more of a shape but even that doesn\u2019t help. My mom (the lady who gave me these suck ass eyebrows) recently tinted her eyebrows for the first time a few weeks ago and they looked nice but it also looked very boxy and painted on almost. My aunt also tints her eyebrows and they look like sharpie. But they barely have any eyebrow hairs so I\u2019m thinking the reason why it may look like that is because it is their skin being tinted. (I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re ugly, they\u2019re very beautiful women!) \n\nLike I said before, I have a lot of eyebrow hairs, they\u2019re just very light so I\u2019m thinking it will look less like sharpie and more natural. I recently found a very promising salon that focuses on eyebrows and all the reviews are saying nothing but good things about them. I\u2019ve tinted my eyebrows at home before with the beard dye for men thingy but it\u2019s a similar situation with when I fill in my eyebrows, the shape always comes out weird and it only lasts a few days. So I\u2019m not the biggest fan of DIY eyebrow tinting. So this time I want to tint my eyebrows with a professional.\n\nWhat are your guys thoughts on professional eyebrow tinting? If you do get your eyebrows tinted, how do you feel about it?",

At first it\u2019s hard because you\u2019re not use to the process, after a while you get your shape and it is much easier. I recommend putting Vaseline around your brows so it doesn\u2019t stain your skin, then using a spoolie you can brush the product on your hairs. After some practice, you don\u2019t need to take those precautions, I now use a slanted brow brush. I\u2019ve used lots of brow tint brands and the just for men beard dye is the best out there, start out with the blonde/light brown color and leave on for 5-10 minutes and reapply if you want it darker.",

The main thing you'd want to change for a glam look would be to have an at least slightly dewier foundation and to add just a touch of highlighter to your cheeks so that they pick up the light. If you're after a goth look, you're perfectly there! Any adjustments would be a matter of preference more than critiques on technique.",

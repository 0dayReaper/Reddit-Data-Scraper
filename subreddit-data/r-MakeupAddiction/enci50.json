Cell phone pictures will look completely different than professional ones.\n\nYour makeup is amazing though, it really does highlight your natural beauty. I hope you post a wedding day pic, I want to see you in full glam! Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials!",

They\u2019re very natural and don\u2019t have a band like strip lashes. Another plus too is you can wear them for about 6 weeks, maybe over a honeymoon. No mascara to apply or remove. No smudging. They\u2019re the best!",

It took me a while to get used to them: sleeping on my back, extra careful removing makeup, washing face, not rubbingeyes, water getting into my eyes in the shower, etc. \n\nI also feel like they look good for maybe a week max and then after that they\u2019re pretty wonky. To you they look fine but everyone else who can see your lashes from diff angles see the bald spots and stuff. \n\nStill prefer strip lashes. My opinion of course!",

I decided to try this instead of the extensions because it's cheaper and you don't have to do any upkeep at all. Mt lashes aren't very long and naturally are quite straight, and they look amazing now. It's nice thay you can also add mascara if you want a little extra going on, but honestly this has been the best low maintenance option for me. I'd highly suggest trying it out.",

Like they were half their length as usual, thin and patchy and awful. An eyelash serum and time fixed everything in the end but yeah would highly not recommend it. It's super expensive too and people get addicted to them and feel the need to continue getting them done.",

I know a pop of color is nice in natural looks but because that location is the only place that color is visible it comes off looking more like irritated/unconcealed eyes instead of a point of interest. Since people are suggesting you use more warm tones to brighten your complexion something more orange and less red might look great if warmth is added to the rest of the face.",

If practical, I recommend doing a few practice runs and then going about your day to see how well/long it lasts. Leading up to my wedding I definitely went to work with more make-up on than usual :) I also recommend using a setting spray to lessen the possibility of it rubbing off on loved ones' clothing.",

The rule of thumb for professional photos is to apply with a *slightly* more heavy hand than you think you should, bc the camera will wash you out. So you may find you need more shadow, blush, or lipstick. But this overall look is fabulous. \n\n(Now I\u2019m off to go look into that lip color, because it is so pretty!)",

The placement of the blush is perfect.\n\nLips are perfect!\n\nFor eyes, I would suggest some false lashes. There are so many beautiful natural ones you can get that have an invisible strip. Don\u2019t be intimidated to try them on. Duo Lash glue is the best tbh. Trick is to make it dry tacky before putting it on. Wet glue just slips off.\nIf you have any bridesmaids or girlfriends, I bet someone knows how to put some on to help.\nI also find individual lashes are SUPER easy to put on and you can decide on how natural or extra you want for volume. \n\nFor eyeshadow, I suggest you bring some of the Misty colour a little bit more to the crease to see the colour better and the light brown blend will look even more gradual! \nI would also take the colour Tease you used on the bottom and bring it up to the top lash line corner by creating a small V shape on the outside. \nAnd finally, take the lightest colour from your eyeshadow palette (Bare I think) and pop it right underneath your brow bone, it will give you a subtle natural pop.\n\nI don\u2019t if you have a highlighter, but I noticed the palette has the colour Eager, like a champagne shimmer. If it\u2019s not too shimmery, put it on the inner corner of your eyes for brightness. You can even put it on your cheekbones if you don\u2019t want to splurge and get a new product for that. Just lightly use your fingers and rub off as much as you can on the back of your hand so it\u2019s not as pigmented and then slightly dab on. If it\u2019s too much, just use the foundation brush to dust it off a bit. And for more pop, do the same on your brow bone too.\n\nMakeup is so multipurpose so you really don\u2019t have to go out and get new products.\n\nIf you want to add a little fun, I noticed without makeup you have a natural blush tone on your nose as if you\u2019ve been sun kissed. If you want to add that, you can do a quick swipe with the left over blush on your brush you put on your cheeks. Just for fun though.\n\nPs, wise choice with purple shadow. Best colour to make your green eyes pop!",

MAC Pro Longwear Liquid concealer - its an eraser in a bottle, very thin yet very pigmented\n4. Anastasia Beverly Hills Liquid Matte LIpstick - Applied once for the day, doesnt come off, pictures were consistent, no need to reapply and no transfer on him for those loads of kissy photos you'll be taking! Also, a matte finish gives such a sweet, soft look to your face!",

I agree that lashes can give any makeup look a little more flair but I\u2019ve never gotten lash extensions so I wouldn\u2019t know what that\u2019s like.

I feel like your natural brows highlight your beautiful features more than they do when filled in (in the second picture). \n\nWhether or not you do this though, I think you look beautiful and have done a great job, both with your makeup and hair!",

    "postText": "So I love red lipstick, but I\u2019m not sure what undertone to pair it with coral/peach tone blushes. I have a very yellow neck but a pretty pink face. I like to wear coral/peach toned blushes because they look more natural and the best on me compared to pinker blushes. Don\u2019t get me wrong I love pink blushes but coral and peaches look the best on me. I need a bit of help picking out a red lipstick preferably a liquid matte lipstick. I love one size and was thinking about the one size red or no speed limit since these two in my opinion are a favorite. I do have joelapuss since it pairs so well with my blush, but I want a red one and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019ll go with peachy blush.",

You have to wipe majority off the brush or it\u2019s likely going to get everywhere. After that, it\u2019s all up to just having a steady hand and tracing the outline properly, very thinly and pretty close to the lash line. Her inner corners are more pointed than mine, so I kinda fake the tip part if that\u2019s an issue for you too lol",

On my nose I used the same bronzer brush and sweeped some on my nose. And on my forehead and brought it closer to the center. For contour I restricted more to where I naturally have the deepest shadows. So for my cheekbones I used a a narrower brush to keep the contour in the hollows of my cheeks. On my nose I also used a skinnier brush and brought it very slightly more inward than the natural width of my nose. On my forehead I kept the contour strictly around the perimeter. And I bronzed lightly under my chin.\n\nEdit: added \"have\"",

Then I use the charcoal glam glow toner, the herbivore prism serum, the lancome renergie eye cream the lancome night creme, and then the herbivore glow oil. In the morning I cleanse and then use the lancome moisture surge, the same eye cream, and the same oil.",

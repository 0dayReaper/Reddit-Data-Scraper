Makeup wasn\u2019t as accessible 5 years ago and people were very limited to what they could purchase. Most high street brands now have affordable dupes which is why makeup has blew up in the past few years. Social media continues to further its impact! If you\u2019re speaking about creative makeup then it\u2019s always been around but was shamed for a long time as it wasn\u2019t considered \u201cnormal\u201d. Euphoria showcases it in a beautiful way and it\u2019s opened eyes. I apologise that this is lengthy but I hope it helps! x",

I started doing creative makeup (so funky eyeliner, coloured shadows) and it escalated to doing more and more detailed work, that\u2019s what my work is most known for online. Plenty of people can do it on paper but to paint it so small on your body, incorporating it into makeup is fun and different but most can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m a super creative person so it makes sense that I love standing out and challenging myself. I also can\u2019t afford to buy paints or equipment but I do get makeup sent for free so it works for me pretty well. I hope this helps!",

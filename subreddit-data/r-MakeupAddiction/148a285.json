    "postText": "Preferably a drug store or cheap creamy one that's close to the Mocha Mami by Fenty.\nIn forms of cream or even a regular powder!\n\nI really am aiming for that RED hue or very warm tone but I can only find it in high brands. Exactly that mocha mami with red undertone or even just a warm one that doesn\u2019t look cold or neutral that\u2019s affordable. Thank you. \n\nMocha Mami:\nhttps://www.sephora.com/product/sun-stalk-r-instant-warmth-bronzer-P55978864?skuId=2211035",

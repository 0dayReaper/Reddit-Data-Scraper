I'll bet that in reality, he doesn't have too many women in his life. Aside from that, his behavior is actionable...what he was doing is similar to sexual harassment. No one has the right to inflict others with unsolicited advice, most especially when it comes to something so personal as makeup. You should take this up with his/your supervisor and demand that this behavior be dealt with. Never, ever allow any man to dictate your actions.\n\n \n\nPlease don't get me wrong, I am not a man-hater. However, I am a feminist and have little patience for any man who seeks to subject women to their opinions as if we have none of our own. Men are being jerks these days because they see the writing on the wall. They are scared...they are losing their 'status' as more and more women step up and take control of their own lives. I say they should run scared. It's time they learned that women don't really need men. Even procreation can be achieved with little male interaction...sure it's fun but seriously, with all the sperm banks available these days the \"need\" for a man is reduced to the status of \"Fun to be around, good to have a companion for life's journey, but not necessarily enough to tolerate being controlled by any male who thinks he knows better.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, you keep on creating marvelous facial art and tell anyone who seeks to take that away from you to stuff it. You are pretty and creative and you deserve the right to express yourself as you wish. If it isn't against company policy, no one has the right to dictate your personal appearance. Even corporate policy steps lightly around such issues.",

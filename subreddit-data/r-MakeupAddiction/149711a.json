I prep my skin with moisturizer and eye cream. I\u2019ve even been trying oils and that just causes the products to separate \ud83d\ude44 any advise is extremely appreciated, I\u2019m at my wits end!",

            "comment": "It depends person to person, but it\u2019s practically impossible to remove all creasing, so always expect there to be a little bit.\n\nWith that in mind, you could try:\n\n1. Prime your under-eyes with primer and spray with setting spray before applying product.\n\n2. Apply a THIN layer of product (I use my fingers for my under eyes but you can use a brush or sponge), and seal immediately with loose/setting powder. (Dab a light layer of powder onto the skin with a soft brush). Set with setting spray.\n\n3. Instead of concealer or foundation, use an eyeshadow primer like PLouise.\n\nHope that helps!",

Then spread it out.\n\nAlso, what products are you using exactly. Some have more powder ingredients in them than others that will rest in creases.",

Becca had an undereye powder which was awesome but it doesn't exist anymore. You can ask for recommendations maybe. I can't think of any recent ones right now.",

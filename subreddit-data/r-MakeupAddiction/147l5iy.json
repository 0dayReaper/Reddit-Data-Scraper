Changed mascaras (from Chanel to L'Or\u00e9al), to using a fan brush to apply mascara and I'm starting to think it could be the curve of my lashes making them touch my concealer? I thought about baking but I'm really not a fan of the matte finish. \n\nFor the first time yesterday I've tried not applying anything to my lower lashes and apart from finding small residue, it didn't ruin my concealer like it usually did.\n\nSo how do you all do it? \ud83e\udd79",

Oil is what we have in our skin, so when oil touches non tubing mascaras it \u201cremoves\u201d the mascara hence the raccoon eyes. It\u2019s a common misconception that to solve the raccoon eyes problem you would need a waterproof mascara- as another Redditor said, waterproof mascaras are oil soluble and hence the oil in our skin, this would exacerbate the issue. \n\nI personally love tubing mascaras because the removal process is so easy and gentle, it avoids damage to my natural lashes.

A few years ago, I think 3 or 4 I tried the only thing that worked and still works for me: I used powder, and I mean a lot. I take my finger, then 3 or 4 swipes of powder on each undereye as close to the eye area as possible. That is the only solution that works. Maybe it works for you too.\n\nPS.: Yeah I know, I sound emotional but the struggle y\u2019all, it was real. \ud83e\udd72",

I also use Ilia as well - it isn\u2019t a tubing one but it does seem to have less reside than some others. I do not apply to my lower lash line! If I do I just use some clear mascara. \n\n2) I spray hydrocholorous spray (tower 28 rescue spray) on eyelids a few times a week which helps clean them and keep the bacteria/yeast at bay. It\u2019s safe for eyes, it\u2019s identical to the spray used for eye mites. I used to have really oily lids (still kind of do) but they cut it down a lot. \n\n3) I use a small brush and specifically powder relatively heavy under my eyes on top of the concealer just to prevent as much transfer as possible.",

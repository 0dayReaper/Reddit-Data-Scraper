    "postText": "How are you making it work? I see everybody raving about this and I have bought is as well but it does not work on me at all. I tried it with 3 different SPFs and it pills over or it sticks wierdly on my skin. It applies horrible with a sponge (dry or wet). Also, it has barely any coverage. It looks like I have nothing on. What\u2019s the hype?",

It gives enough coverage to even out my skin tone but not to look like I obviously have anything on. \n\nI have heard some people really like and some people really don't like depending on skin type. I have oily/combo skin and really like it, but I know some people with drier skin who couldn't make it work.",

I use the Maybelline baby skin primer underneath it and let it sit about 5 minutes. I then go in with the Elf ultimate blending brush and use it to apply the skin tint. I used to use my fingers, and then for a long time used a sponge, however I find that the brush applies it so seamlessly. I\u2019ll set it with powder and the NYX matte setting spray. \n\nWith the baby face primer and the setting spray, it stays on my face all day and my oil feels a lot more controlled than with any other primer combo.",

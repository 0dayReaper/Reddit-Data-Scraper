On a day you're not really leaving the house, do some fun makeup and no foundation. Just bop around doing your chores and relaxing, and check yourself out in the mirror a lot. Try that a few times, then try going to the grocery store with no foundation. Then maybe lunch with a friend. Eventually you'll get used to how you look without it, no foundation will seem normal and wearing foundation will feel super glam.\n\nI've been on the no-foundation train for a few months now, and looking at pictures, I think my particular skin  honestly looks better without it. \n\nIf you want a little redness and shine control, I HIGHLY recommend the Korres Greek yogurt cleanser. Switching to this was a big step in my no-foundation journey.",

I was in college at the time and I would rush to class and not always have time to do my full makeup routine so I would have to go to class barefaced sometimes. I felt super vulnerable the first time but then I realized no one cared except me. Little by little I would go to the supermarket, run errands, eventually meet up with friends with just concealer and mascara...Eventually you realize you're the only one that really cares. and the people that do care well, they should find more important things to care about. Start wearing concealer and/or tinted sunscreens. Normalize your own face and the beauty of the features you have. Its a journey for all of us, and you'll get to a place where you feel beautiful and confident sooner than you think!",

Since I started working from home full time, I stopped wearing makeup entirely and I really got used to seeing my bare face. It seems crazy but it worked, after 3 years I see makeup as an optional enhancement, not as a baseline for what my face should look like anymore. I only wear minimal makeup at work (one day a month) and I don\u2019t wear any at home or to go shopping etc... I really think it\u2019s about getting used to seeing your own face and then you\u2019ll start appreciating it as it is. \n\n\nI used to be super insecure about my dark under eyes for example, and now they don\u2019t bother me anymore because I see them everyday. I even felt happy when I realized recently that when I\u2019m actually rested, they\u2019re really not that visible!\n\n\nSo maybe start with not wearing makeup to go shopping or for some activities? Start small and work your way up, if you already stopped wearing makeup at home you already started :)",

Brought the powder foundation again and didn\u2019t even open it. \n\nMy skin thanks me though- aside from a few hormonal (minor) breakouts, the last few years have practically un-aged me",

Especially if we just pass them by on the street.\n\nBe kind to yourself and take your time. Experiment with different steps and see what you're comfortable with.

In the meanwhile, ditch the foundation only opt for a concealer. Spot correct the redest of the acne. Wear mascara without anything else, or add some blush. \n\nTwo, don't look at yourself in the mirror as often. It helps. \n\nThree, improve your hair and style.

I used to also feel like I needed to wear foundation whenever I left the house, insecure without it on. I started to realize I was the only person who noticed if I was wearing it or not. I realized I don\u2019t notice if others are wearing it, (unless it\u2019s heavy/cakey /mismatched/obvious). From there I realized if I\u2019m not paying attention to what others are wearing, it\u2019s likely that people aren\u2019t paying attention to what I\u2019m wearing. I still wear eye makeup, but as I\u2019m getting a bit older I have invested in good skincare and have nicer skin now than when I was younger. I am also finding foundation sits differently on my face than when I was younger, and now that I\u2019ve taken a break from it I think I actually look younger without it. I now only wear a light weight foundation on a night I am getting dressed up/going out. The funny thing? I don\u2019t miss it. My skin is happier, cleaner, fewer breakouts without it, and over time my confidence has grown as I have learned to appreciate myself without it. I wish I had done this years ago. It takes time, but I feel better now than I ever have before. Taking a break from it might inspire similar changes in you. I\u2019m like one other commenter suggested, I also started with no makeup at home/small trips to the store etc. small amounts of concealer in areas I felt needed it, now I just wear an spf with primer during the day.

I\u2019m 55 years old and started wearing makeup when I was twelve and had cystic acne. \n\nLast week I had my second ever facial. It was amazing.  I am probably ancient compared to you but I\u2019m hoping you can break the \u201cfoundation\u201d cycle and be comfortable sooner than me. \n\n The key to wearing foundation is to have it become part of your skin rather than sit on top of it. Less is more. If you don\u2019t want to invest in a bunch of new foundations you can mix what you have with a moisturizer you like. Do your regular skin care. Let each step fully absorb. Now using a beauty blender mix your foundation with moisturizer and start on any problem areas. Gradually add more moisturizer and less foundation just concentrating on lightly covering areas you want to conceal. Eventually you can eliminate foundation all together. Plus when you do wear foundation try to keep light, with a bit of powder to set and absorb any oil.\n\nLastly, do not confuse oily acne prone skin with moisture. Moisture will keep your foundation from creasing, cracking, pilling, etc.\n\nI used to wear full coverage matte foundation\u2026.every single day and now I\u2019m light to medium coverage, just a whisper of powder and it lasts all day and looks wayyy better. I even went to the store an hour ago without any makeup at all. It is a transition, go gradually and it will be easier on your self esteem \ud83d\ude0a",

Because you can have most glam and full makeup, but it will look bad because you are uncomfortable. As many here sad if your skin is hydrated and sun screened you will be totally ok.

I used to have a huge issue with this all through high school and probably into my mid-twenties? Somewhere around my late twenties, I got my skincare routine going really well and also just didn't care as much. I know that's not necessarily helpful, but I think my comfort level with my face being bare got easier over time.\n\nDon't beat yourself up about it! You'll find your way to what makes sense for you.

Maybe because it brought out more of my insecurities like all the little bumps on my face, and it took more work to get ready in the morning. I realized that putting on all that foundation stopped being fun a long time ago for daily use. So now I only foundation on special occasions.\n\nI\u2019m not completely comfortable with my skin yet since I still have acne, hyperpigmentation, etc, etc. But skin care is your number one best friend. I thought it was my shield too, but when I took off that shield and just started using other makeup products alone after using a moisturizer and sunscreen, I realized how much better I felt. \n\nEven now that I\u2019m taking a break from putting on makeup completely (for now) I\u2019ve gotten used to seeing my face. When you\u2019re wearing foundation you only see (well I\u2019m only assuming so correct me if I\u2019m wrong) your bare face for half of the day. Maybe you just need to try and get used to going without it. I agree with the other comments, start with small activities and focus on skin care (it doesn\u2019t have to be a complicated routine either, and sorry if this post is a mess \ud83d\ude2d I just read your post and related 100%)",

One great hack is to use a tinted sunscreen - it's a nice transition to bare skin. Also, if you love makeup, then still doing the other stuff like highlighted and blush can really make a difference. Ultimately, you're going for a different look, and finding your no makeup version is the way to go. \n\nFor me, I went from full coverage - color corrector, foundation, concealer, powder, and spray, to then just foundation, to then tinted sunscreen, to now nothing except the add ons (blush, highligter, and eye makeup, but only when I feel like it). It takes a minute, but now I don't really like putting on skin makeup at all because I don't feel like it looks like me.

Maybe start by moving to a light coverage foundation, skin tint, or tinted moisturizer and keep wearing concealer (and bronzer/blush if you usually do). And gradually lighten up the amount &amp; coverage of product until you can drop the skin tint/light foundation altogether, then reduce how much concealer you use. The hardest thing for me was always people I know seeing me barefaced, since they know how I \u201cnormally\u201d look, which is why gradually decreasing the quantity of product was easier for me; they didn\u2019t really notice a change for a few weeks. \n\nIt can also feel less jarring to wear a bolder lip than usual as you\u2019re getting used to showing your bare skin. I still wear a bolder lip than normal when I\u2019m having a tough skin day lol. \n\nFor sure invest in some quality skincare and stick to your routine. \n\nMost importantly, be gentle and patient with yourself. I promise almost no one will notice you\u2019re not wearing much makeup, and the vast majority of the few people who do won\u2019t actually have any thoughts/opinions. People are a) kinder than we give them credit for, and b) less observant of our appearance than we think they are. \n\nBest of luck!!! Keep us updated!!!\ud83d\udc96",

Basically if you wear makeup to cover up an insecurity frequently, obviously it's going to stand out once you completely cut out the makeup. Do it gradually. Mix more and more lotion into your foundation to dilute it, then move on to BB cream, then tinted sunscreen, then you can go bare without realizing you used to hate it.

I developed an allergy in 2018 that prevents me from putting any sort of foundation/powder on and I thought it was the end of my \u2018looking decently attractive\u2019 life and basically holed myself up for several months. Now, I feel more attractive without it, even though I still have imperfections.  Thinking back on all those years of covering my face, I felt sad for myself. I couldn\u2019t accept my appearance because it wasn\u2019t flawless.  My pores look smaller now that I\u2019m not putting anything on, which helps.

CeraVe hydrating face wash at night, followed by BHA. I let that dry a little, then snail mucin serum, let that dry a little, then a thick layer of CeraVe moisturizing cream. \n\nIn the morning, instead of washing my face I just gently rinse to get rid of any sleep in my eyes. A lot of the previous night\u2019s moisturizer is still on my skin at that point and it works perfectly as a sort of \u201cprimer\u201d. I follow that with a little bit of good matte powder to make my skin look even and dry, then I do very little make-up.\n\nNow I do that whole routine except I added tinted sunscreen as concealer, then powder, a light brow pencil, MAYBE some light mascara, and occasionally just a hint of blush. Top that off with a good lipgloss (or Aquaphor lip balm, which is good for your lips AND looks just like lip gloss), and you have a low-maintenance \u201cNatural Look\u201d with products that are cheap, easy, and actually good for your skin. \n\nThis may not be what you\u2019re looking for, but I remember when I tried to stop wearing makeup altogether and I also felt naked and vulnerable. Having healthy, simple, low-maintenance skincare and a light makeup routine struck the perfect balance for me. \n\nIf you\u2019re curious about any of the products I mentioned, let me know and I\u2019ll link them.",

After some research on powder correctors I found [Stila One Step color corrector powder](https://www.stilacosmetics.com/products/one-step-correct-brightening-finishing-powder). Back in the day I used Covergirl green and yellow corrector sticks and have since forgotten since I dove into full face foundation.

Now, I\u2019m a lot more relaxed about whether I wear makeup or not. It was actually overall a good change.\n\nMy suggestion is try going totally without makeup and see if resetting helps you out. Start with home then easy places like the gas station. Then drugstore\u2026 grocery store\u2026 you will start to get used to it and it will feel more natural \ud83d\ude42\n\nI also second/third/fourth etc. tinted sunscreen.

And from someone who suffers from very uneven pigment on their face.....I can honestly say....... No one gives a shit more than you!!

I have definitely learned that other people would love my skin more than they're own, so love what you got!!",

Finally I had gotten fed up with and just threw everything away. \n\nNot having the makeup in the house reduces the temptation to not put it on (it also increases the money in your wallet lol). After a good six months of not wearing anything, I did put on makeup and surprisingly within minutes I wanted to wash my face because the feeling on the makeup sitting on my skin was horrible. I\u2019ve gone through some little phases of using an eye brow pencil and mascara, but I\u2019ve found now (after regularly not wearing any makeup for years) that to me it\u2019s not worth the time and effort and trying to keep it looking nice by ensuring I don\u2019t rub my face or my eyes. \n\nI\u2019m now working on skincare, to try to make my skin look better long term. \n\nIt also helps if you are able to create a mindset that gives less importance to what others think of you. It can be a really difficult thing, and I\u2019ve found that it comes with age and life experience. Deciding that you don\u2019t care if other people find you attractive or not and deciding that you don\u2019t need people in your life if their value of you is based upon your appearance is empowering.",

Are there any steps in your routine that you can eliminate a little at a time? Get used to seeing your skin more by gradually wearing less and less or using a lower coverage product.

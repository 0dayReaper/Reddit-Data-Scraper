And while what you are doing now doesnt look bad at all, you are making your eyes look a lot smaller, rounded and closed off by completely outlining them in black that way. If you use a dark brown eyeliner only on the top.. do just a slim line all the way across the eyelid.. skinnier in the inside to then a bit thicker at the outer corner, and then with a little upturned flick at the very end. This gives your eye a very open and lifted look, instead of the closed off and small look from before. That little flick makes it seem like your eyes are turned up at the end. Then you can also use a beige eyeliner on the bottom water line to open up your eyes even more. If you like lashes, put a small half lash on the outside corners only to add to the effect of bright, open, upturned eyes. You can also play around with fun colours on the bottom waterline to really make your eyes pop. I usually do the brown on top, and on the bottom either green, blue or purple. It looks so stunning and I get so many compliments when i do it that way. Other than that, I think your makeup looks great and you are absolutely stunning!",

No one can see you can you can try 50 times if you want, no one has to see you. It's makeup. It's not life threatening.\n\nSmitha Depak has tons of tutorials for you:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/@SmithaDepak](https://www.youtube.com/@SmithaDepak)",

But if you're wanting to add or do somthing new, you could always try more lip colors that are still neutral enough for work.\nColors such as pillow talk from Charlotte tilbury, or even Dolcia Vita pencil lipstick from nars are some options. \n\nFor the eyes, I actually really like the tight line you do with the black liner. You can always do a sweep of a nice warm brown shadow lightly on the lid, or even some peach tones to add some colors to compliment your eye color. Also, like some have suggested, you can also play with different color liners such as grey, plum or a dark brown Even.",

From there, I line and smudge above my lash line on my upper lid, sometimes extending that smudge of pigment up toward the end of my brow like a wing. I then lightly *dab* the eyeliner along the lashes of the outer 1/3 of my lower lash line (you want a barely noticeable line here for everyday looks), using a q tip or brush to smudge and blend if need be. Applying liner to these areas only creates a natural upturned cat eye look that\u2019s fantastic. I absolutely love Lanc\u00f4me\u2019s Le Crayon Kohl in Black Coffee for this. It is so perfectly blendable that you can even create a smokey eye out of it by blending the liner up like a shadow, and I think the color would look great on you. The only other thing I might suggest is adding a little blush and bronzer.",

In a salon or supper club or even flight attendant or role that is a bit centered around glamour etc it would be fine. Just my opinion!\n\nIt's also a little unbalanced (tho fine) for having a natural skin look overall (which is nice but just a little unbalanced.)",

Although a dark purple would bring out the color of your eyes nicely.

Blush is also fun to change up and will give you a different look with different colors.",

    "postText": "Hi all, it's my first ever post! \n\nIn the comment is a photo of my everyday makeup look (with messier brows than usual). It hasn't changed in a while, but I have. I am in my mid-30s and my face is here to tell the world. What I notice most is volume loss in my cheeks. I get hollows under my eyes and on my temples and it makes the apple of my cheeks more pronounced. All makeup tutorials say to place blush high on the cheekbone for a more lifted look, but when I do it, I feel like it looks so out of place. \n\nAm I crazy to wear blush right on the apple of my cheek and even dust my nose with it? The placement feels like it fits my face best, and it's where I naturally flush, but I never see it anywhere in tutorials. Does it look strange? \n\nLove this thread by the way. Y'all are beautifully supportive, and I appreciate the help.\n\nAlso PS: All other makeup tips are welcome! I haven't figured out how to cover up my *new* melasma spots or how to update my everyday eye look now that I have little corner folds forming. I love learning from all of you! \n\nK. Thanks!",

You certainly don't look hollow (I'm thinking that weird buccal fat removal trend), not on the cheeks or under your eyes. I wouldn't change a thing. \n\nI love to play with my makeup and usually at night when I'm about to double cleanse, get my pj's on and turn in. I'll do a some new technique, or a smokey eye just for shits and giggles. I'll take it off 10 mins later but it's fun to experiment with those colours in the palette you never touch and if your eyeliner is wonky it doesn't matter. \nIt's a good non intimidating way of trying new looks with no pressure.",

Apply TGIN Buttercream Daily Moisturizer OR KeraCare Twist &amp; Define Cream (I say \u201cor\u201d bc honestly I can\u2019t exactly remember which one I used, I might\u2019ve just gone back and forth between the two tbh lmao)\n3. Apply Blue Magic Originals Indian Hemp Hair and Scalp Conditioner\n4. Apply Eco Styler Black Castor &amp; Flaxseed Oil Gel OR Eco Styler Olive Oul Gel (I say \u201cor\u201d bc I ran out of the black castor gel mid-styling and had to resort to the olive oil gel jar I had, but I prefer the black castor one for the shine and definition it gives!)\n5. Apply Curls Passion Fruit Control Paste OR TGIN Smooth &amp; Hold Edge Control Gel Extra Hold (there\u2019s two different types, I use either one)  \n\n\nI applied these products in this exact order for every single twist \ud83d\ude0a I usually leave my twists in for about 2-3 weeks before I take them out. I apply all of these products to freshly washed hair (I use the Aphogee Shampoo for Damaged Hair). I don\u2019t use conditioner after shampoo bc honestly it\u2019s gonna get washed out anyway and I just use my leave-in styling products for moisture. I do however like using a cheap conditioner to detangle before I shampoo (e.g., the VO5 conditioner, which is BOMB), and I detangle using the Bestool Detangling Brush off Amazon. After I detangle but before I shampoo I like to do a hot oil treatment on my scalp bc I have seborrheic dermatitis and the hot oil helps lift and dissolve the scales. After letting the oil sit on my scalp under a plastic bag and a microwaveable heating cap (I use the Hot Head Deep Conditioning Heat Cap by Thermal Hair Care), I proceed to wash out the oil and shampoo \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe Hope that answers everything!",

I also want to learn how to use makeup to make myself feel better. Can anyone recommend me some basic makeup products for teens???",

It's best to start simple and build your routine/collection as you figure what works best. :) I like using TikTok to learn about new products and techniques.",

            "comment": "Nyx has nice foundations, nars has good bronzers, makeup revolution setting peach powder is great. I like morphy for eyeshadow, elf has a good concealer. Milk makeup and it cosmetics make very nice natural and hydrating makeup products. Milk makeup or too faced primers are THE BEST. Make up revolution does very nice highlighters. For budget friendly makeup you can try essence. My favourite setting spray is from urban decay (extra glow), but that's up to you, this one costs more. Use moisturizes before applying makeup and wait a bit before putting primer on. Cream products then setting spray, then powder products and setting spray. I like the liner from nyx. Natural brows are best, brush upwards and downwards on ends. For a natural look use a tinted moisturizer or a bb cream. You need to determine your skin tone first and less is more when it comes to the base make up. If you want blush go for a delicate one and it\u2019d be nice if you could determine your face shape for the best placement. With lashes apply mascara downwards then from side to side, then upwards and you can brush it with a clean brush if needed (that's what I do for the best effect). If you make a mess use an ear pick, a dry one, not wet), put less makeup in the places that might creas. If you need any advice you can dm me, I'm always here to help\ud83d\udc97",

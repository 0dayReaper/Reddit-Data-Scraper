    "postText": "I have a fair to medium skin tone but with really severe dark circles around my eyes. My dark circles spread from under my eyebrows to the eyelids till the under eyes. While the color corrector did cover my under eyes and eyelids just good enough (there are still a little bit dark), my main concern is the skin between eyebrow and eyelid. The skin remain darker than the eyelids and didnt match my eyelids skin tone even when i tried so many color corrector. I dont think this is due to the bone structure bcs i did the pinch test for my dark circles and the darkness didnt go away. Could anyone help me on how to cover this darkness around my eyes perfectly especially on the skin between eyebrows and eyelids? For tear trough, i find it frustrating because i tried to apply a lighter concealer than my skin tone but it still didnt work. Anyone could help?",

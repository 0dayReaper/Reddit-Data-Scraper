I will FIND you some real life inspa...\n\nEdit: Source: Wore blue, and even more importantly WHITE eyeshadow/liners with Tammy Faye Bakker (Google it if you aren't familiar) level amounts of mascara, with copious amounts of glitter on top. This, framing a canvas of Cover Girl foundation in whatever color Cindy Crawford or Niki Taylor or even Drew Barrymore happened to be wearing in the YM or Seventeen magazine spreads.... Hahahahaha you guys have it SO good! (Then again, back then only our parents had cameras, sooooooo...)\n\nEdit #2: Does this at least mean I qualify for a senior discount yet? Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk is a whole hell of a lot more expensive to smear the wrong color on your face... Just saying, haha :)",

That\u2019s just how I personally do shadow, by blending everything out from darkest to lightest shade, but everyone has their preferences! Finally I took the shimmer shades on a small packing brush and lightly tapped then onto the center of my lid.",

Honestly you\u2019re way better at makeup than I am so I feel silly even giving you CC but if I had to find something, I\u2019d say maybe fill in the tails of your brows a little thicker/longer. But honestly it all looks beautiful. Great brow shape, love the lip, and the lashes are amazing.",

So so so pretty. \n\nWhy two primers and where do you apply them? I\u2019m hella dry, so that dewy one is calling my name.\n\nSorry, just saw that someone else asked this and you answered. Also agree that a little more crease eyeshadow action would be good, but tbh that would take this look from perfectly lovely any time, to a little more drama-y, and I don\u2019t think you need to up the ante because it\u2019s beautiful.",

    "postText": "QUICK QUESTION THO: how do you make your chin/jaw less cakey? I have reaaaally bad jaw acne (on medication for it) and an effort to cover it up with so much Concealer and setting powder makes it very obvious how much foundation I have. Is that something that comes with the territory of covering acne? Am I just used to air brushed photoshop style photos that make covering acne look flawless? Typically only wear makeup twice a month for a couple hours so don't say its makeup causing the acne lol it's hormonal. \nAlso any advice on Eyeshadow creases is welcome idk if I made the creases too tall/short. Thank you love yall!!! \u2764\ufe0f",

            "comment": "I feel like if you use less concealer that is good quality with good coverage it\u2019ll be less cakey. Usually more matte formulas can look more cakey, and more dewy formulas look more natural. I also am getting bad acne on my jaw lately, so I\u2019m struggling with the same thing lol. Also, I think you\u2019re just used to the airbrushed photoshopped images, and certain lighting can make most makeup look super flawless. I think your base looks pretty great tho!!",

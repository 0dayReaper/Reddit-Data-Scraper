I noticed it in this picture MUCH more than in person. \n\nAlso... I know we gotta stop feeling self conscious \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f and love our features... I\u2019ll work on that \ud83e\udd2d",

He met me with a full face of makeup and honestly... I felt self conscious at first. But he saw me the same way even without makeup, he didn\u2019t care that I had bags under my eyes.\n\nAlso, I\u2019d say a guy doesn\u2019t deserve my time of day if he can\u2019t appreciate both right and left. And that\u2019s not necessarily directed to you \ud83d\ude43",

He probably prefers the way he looks with a hat and wanted to look his favorite way for dates. \n\nUnless we're going to submit naked full body mug shots to potential partners where there's no makeup,  no beards, no glasses,  shaved heads,  etc. there's going to be some discoveries along the way about how the person looks when they're unstyled. That's good,  it's a fun part of intimacy.  \n\nAn obsession with standards of beauty will only lead you to a dark road if you're planning on getting married and being with your wife through her sixties,  seventies,  eighties,  and beyond.",

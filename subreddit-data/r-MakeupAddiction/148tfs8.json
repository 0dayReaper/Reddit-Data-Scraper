    "postText": "I use Make Up For Ever Sens'eyes to remove my eye makeup as I have very sensitive eyes and only use waterproof liner &amp; mascara. Unlike balms, oils, and waters this has never stung and I can wear my contacts during makeup removal. Went to reorder and can't find it anywhere! It has been my holy grail for a decade. There is a new gel formula (vs the lotion consistency of Sens'eyes). Has anybody tried the new MUFE gentle eye gel? Any other sensitive eye lotion like removers I should check out?",

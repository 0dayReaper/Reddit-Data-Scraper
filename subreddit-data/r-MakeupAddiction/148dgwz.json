            "comment": "I was intrigued by the blue enamel Christian Dior lipstick, so I researched a little. According to [this lady](http://pinkhairedprincess.blogspot.com/2022/05/flashback-beauty-friday-70-rouge-dior.html), it is from the 80s. As you can see, the next iteration had the new logo - Dior without Christian and the CD on top. I tried to figure out when exactly they rebranded, but couldn't find any source. ChatGPT claims it was in 2012, but I don't think that is accurate at all, I think it was sooner (my guess would be somewhere around 1999). I asked it for the source and it couldn't provide it, silly AI !!",

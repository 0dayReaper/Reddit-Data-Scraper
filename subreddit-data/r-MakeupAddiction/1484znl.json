    "postText": "I am flying in for my best friend's wedding as one of the bridesmaids, I really can't afford to take anymore time off of work but I wanted to fly in the day of, but I have a professional makeup artist friend where I live who will do my hair and makeup for a major discount and she's really good. She offered to come over early in the morning before I make my way to the airport (she is a saint), but I am just wondering if it will all still look good after a two hour flight or if being in the air or something will make my skin dry and makeup crack or my hair look weird. should I just cut my losses and push my budget and get it done when I get there? I am in a tight financial spot and it would be much better for me to get my friend to do it, but I also am seeing people I haven't met in years and wanna look my best.",

I find that dewy foundations will last longer, especially I\u2019m thinking on a dry  flight. Definitely use a setting spray to keep everything in place. Obviously drinking a ton of water, getting a good nights rest, will help. No idea on face masks before though not my forte. For sure keep makeup in your carry on to fix anything that might get smudged. Maybe lighter eyeshadow colours too (dark tones could smudge if you accidentally rub your eye or something ). A professional artist will usually use higher end brands that tend to stay on longer plus their expertise on how to apply it/ using the right primers / setting spray etc",

If you have one I\u2019d recommend using one that has some skincare properties as well as setting makeup. Spray it when you get on the plane and spray it on after, that should save your face. NYX (Bare with Me) and Elf (Hydrating Coconut Mist) have some decent sprays that are inexpensive. If you want something a bit higher end, the travel size Rare Beauty 4 in 1 spray is $14. The super boogie option is the Tatcha Luminous Dewy skin mist is amazing but the mini is $22 \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

    "postText": "I have social anxiety and struggle to walk into makeup shops, especially since any brand shop where I live is almost always nearly empty with 5 employees inside. I shudder thinking about it. 3 days back, there was a NARS pop up booth promoting their foundation. If only I was free that day \ud83d\ude2d I really regret it because it was a chance to finally swatch foundation to try find my match. Also, it was at the entrance of the mall so the Covid risk was reduced \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d Foundations carried at pharmacies don\u2019t have my shade \ud83e\udd72",

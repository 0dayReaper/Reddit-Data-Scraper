As for your question, I'd say hang the mirror, it'll free up enough space that she can fit more stuff at the back part of the table - like lotions, hairspray what not. Then around the mirror some nice shelves to the right and left for more storage (you can never have too much storage). A nice long shelf (or two staggered shelves) along the wall to the left of the vanity too. On the table, you could put some type of heat-protectant thing (glass works too) so she can put her hairstyling tools down without ruining that beautiful table top. Winners or those type of department stores are good for finding useful accessories like that. \n\nShe'll def love it as is though!",

The old one ate through batteries constantly, and it was a pain to deal with it slowly getting dimmer. It also only displays a coolish-toned light, which isn't the best for showing how makeup will look in natural light. \n\n\nI replaced mine with [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HNS6Q5B/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_apa_i_rQ6gEb3C4RVE3) mirror. It plugs in, so I don't have to worry about batteries anymore. It's also has 3 different light temperatures (cool, warm, and a mix of both), so I know how my makeup will look in pretty much every light. Plus there are various different magnification levels. \n\n\nAside from that, it looks amazing!! My husband did something similar when I went on a work trip, and coming back to it was just the best feeling. She'll love it, and your an awesome husband for surprising her! \n\n\nP.S. I have the same glass and metal organizer that you have next to the lighted mirror, and it rocks! Good choice!",

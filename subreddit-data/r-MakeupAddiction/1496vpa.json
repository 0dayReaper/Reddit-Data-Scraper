    "postText": "I got the nars soft matte concealer in madeleine which is light with neutral undertones. But it\u2019s pulling a bit yellow on me. I have tried a hundred times to figure out and understand my undertones and I can\u2019t get my head around it. So if neutral undertones are pulling yellow, which direction do I need to go?",

Some brands will have products that have a tone mix of both. Heck, you could be cool tone. It\u2019s super frustrating but if you aren\u2019t too committed to nars, somewhere out there is a concealer that is perfect for you &lt;3",

For anyone wondering, I whiten them periodically with a gel I got from my dentist, but you could just use over the counter whitening gel probably just buy/make a custom tray for your teeth. I also use the Tarte pearly girl pen sometimes. It doesn\u2019t hurt my teeth as much as the crest strips used to. I also drink all my coffee with a straw lol",

Wow that pain was unbelievable! It felt like having a sensitive sweet tooth x100 on every single tooth simultaneously. I never realized how that having your teeth whitened could cause such intense pain, and I always thought I had pretty decent tolerance for pain. I ended the whitening procedure early because I couldn't handle it anymore.",

It was the Pantone color of the year in.. 2012? I think? What a year that was. \n\nThis is such a wearable way to do a bright color. I feel like always see bright colors done in a way that\u2019s really out there, which is great, but the subtlety of this look is what I love so much about it. \n\nYour foundation looks flawless. Like you\u2019re not wearing anything, but just have absolutely perfect skin and complexion.\n\nAlso are those real freckles or part of the look? Either way, I LOVE them.",

    "postText": "Soo I looked online a bunch and what I've come to discover is that I have to determine my undertones (I think im neutral) and then match a foundation to my face. \n\nNow my question is, when I go to the store can I use the tester and swatch it directly on my face? That seems kinda unhygienic, but where would I match it to instead? And since it's spring I'd also choose a foundation 1 or 2 shades darker for summer when I tan, since now I'm white as a ghost. \n\nHow exactly do I go about this? Any help is appreciated",

            "comment": "Most foundations have a pump, so the product is not exposed. I usually take a paper handkerchief and wipe the pump before I use it. As for shade matching... I would HIGHLY recommend you take a couple samples of foundation home and do a whole day wear test, instead of trying to make a final decision in store. The lightning in stores is awful, the foundations can oxidize on your skin (sometimes within 5 minutes, sometimes within half an hour), it's also very important to see how the formula works with your skincare/spf, how it wears throughout the day, in various lightning etc. Generally, people match their foundation to their neck and chest (I actually don't, because my neck is lighter than my face and if I match it to that, I end up looking like a ghost). Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVVnn0myFeI) on shade matching that may help you.",

I'm in Australia and I've gotten a free foundation sample from Mecca, which was a REALLY generous size too :-) might be better that way so u can see how it wears etc",

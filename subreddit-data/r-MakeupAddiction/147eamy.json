            "comment": "I also have sensory issues and automatically take that into account for all makeup (no glosses, heavy foundation for longer than 1 hour, powders, lashes, cream products, and glitters.) \n\nI don\u2019t know your makeup style, but I do a lot of colourful looks and I know something I\u2019m comfortable wearing out and about are water activated liners. Having them literally dry down and being super smooth to apply is more preferable to me than black liquid liner or cr\u00e8me eyeliners. Supershocks by colourpop have high impact and aren\u2019t heavy feeling on the skin. Blush, I\u2019d just use a tint liquid and lips, a lip stain. Having it stain and not feeling physical product on my skin makes it a lot easier for me to not be super anxious about touching my face and feeling things slip and slide. I like Doe Lashes, I use the magnetic ones but their liner is kinda horrible to work with so I use a different magnetic eyeliner. Foundations and face products, I\u2019d say maybe a skin tint or tinted sunscreen? Something that\u2019s meant to feel like nothing. If you want full coverage, Sephora collection best skin ever foundation doesn\u2019t make me feel itchy and weird. Powders, I\u2019d go with a pressed powder (I used sephora collection baked foundation powder) because something about loose powders sitting on the skin doesn\u2019t feel that great.",

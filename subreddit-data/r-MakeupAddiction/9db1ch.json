First assignment was to create a 10 second or longer stop motion video to \u201ctransition\u201d from still picture to motion picture. The professor wanted us to incorporate our other interests so she can learn more about us, so I did stop motion makeup application :)\n\nP.S. It\u2019s not actually due for another week, I did it the day after class because I was worried I would badly mess up and need to do it over. So if you have anything that I need to drastically improve upon feel free to share. Not my best makeup cos I was more focused on the picture aspect, but still!\n\n\u2661 Product list \u2661\n\nFace: Makeup Revolution Fast Base Stick F4, Too Faced Born This Way concealer in Nude, Milk setting powder in light, Physicians Formula Butter Highlight in Galactic, Colourpop Powder Blush in To the 10, Physicians Formula Butter Bronzer in Bronzer\n\nEyes: Colourpop You Had Me At Hello Palette, Stila Glitter &amp; Glow Eyeshadow in Smoldering Satin, Tarte Double Take Liner, Milk Kush Mascara\n\nBrows: NYX brow mascara in black, ABH Dipbrow in Ebony\n\nLips: Urban Decay Lip Mousse I totally forget the shade but I can look it up if you want, the Tarte gloss that changes based off the PH of your lips :)",

Maybe do similar faces at the end? I think a few more seconds of the makeup face would be good. \n\nI really enjoyed it! Where's the cat tax :p",

I use the Canon mobile app &amp; I just applied a teensy bit of makeup, snapped a pic, a teensy bit more, etc. Had about 250 RAW images in the end. Popped them into Lightroom, tweaked the white balance &amp; contrast, &amp; exported them as JPEGS. Popped them into premiere, changed the duration to 3 frames (2 frames moved too quickly) &amp; then I placed them on the timeline. That was it! But if you have any other questions lmk.",

Before reading the caption I thought YOU were the inspiration pic (the actual inspo is just as iconic). The brown shades in your eyeshadow suit you incredibly well, I'm equally amazed and confused on how you got that to blend SO WELL into the blue. As someone with very similar color of blue eyes, I always find myself stuck in the copper tones rut. I never would have thought to use the icy blue, but you've now proved how damn GOOD blue can look with blue eyes!! \n\nNot that I have the skill to pull off a look this detailed (or if I wasn't so bad at blending...), but you've truly inspired me to explore my palettes- beyond just the coppers, browns, and mochas!!!\n\nSorry I'm really just fan girling out rn, I haven't been this captivated by a makeup look in a long while. Based on the other comments, it sounds like I have been missing out on your tiktoks! Will go follow now :) Sorry to geek, this just like... really moved me \ud83e\udd29",

Overline your lips but keep them matte and maybe a bit more of a natural nude colour - eyes are the focus of this look. Brows are too rounded and surprised looking, softly elongate them. Gem stones placement should flare up and out, not be placed in a rounded formation that dips down at the outer eye. The inner eye blue on model is more of an ethereal aqua than the powder blue you have on.",

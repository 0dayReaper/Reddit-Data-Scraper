    "postText": "Here in this local area, I can find a number of eye primers, and [the Artdeco all-in-one eye primer](https://www.artdeco.co.uk/all-in-one-eye-primer-balance/13467285.html) was recommended to me by a few people. But, others advised against it, saying that it won't hold eyeshadow (glittery eyeshadow in particular) in place for more than maybe 2-3 hours. So I am not sure what to think. I know there are some favorite eye primers in this sub (the Milani one for example), but this Artdeco one is easy to get around here. I do need eye primer that lasts for more than ~6-7 hours for an upcoming event though. So, should I get another one, or is this one good for that? Do you have experience with this one?",

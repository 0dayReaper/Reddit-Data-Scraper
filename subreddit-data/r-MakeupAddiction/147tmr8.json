            "comment": "So for pimples, spot covering is best, you can use the skin tint all over and then put a bit of that maybelline concealer on your hand and with a tiny tiny brush use it to spot conceal any blemish, once you place it on the blemish, do not swipe the brush but tap it, with your fingers then blend just the edges and you should have the max coverage that way",

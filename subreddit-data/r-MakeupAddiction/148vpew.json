    "postText": "I have extremely light skin, it\u2019s dry and acne prone, I\u2019ve been meaning to buy a cream contour product to give my face some life, I use a powdered product usually, but want to switch to cream (since, my skin is on the dry side). I don\u2019t really mind the price, I mostly care about it not looking caky. It\u2019s hard to find smth that\u2019s not warm from the ones I swatched on my skin. I think a contour stick is best, but I don\u2019t mind a cream palette. I\u2019ve seen people recommend e.l.f, but that one is sold out. The Fenty ones are too warm for me, unfortunately. I put a picture in the comments\ud83e\udd17",

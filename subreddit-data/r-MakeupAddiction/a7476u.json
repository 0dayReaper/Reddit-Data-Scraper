She can barely walk by herself, has had diabetes for 40 years, and suffers from early onset dementia. I think that\u2019s the difference between taking care of yourself and not and the woman in the photo definitely took care of herself. She obviously ate a healthy diet, drank water, has good genes, and probably wore sun screen daily. Those things are heavily sought after traits in this subreddit and also especially in /r/skincareaddiction where the whole point is to improve skin imperfections and avoid skin damage and aging. ",

    "postText": "So I bought some gorgeous loose pigments, but got them home and realised I have no idea what I'm supposed to mix them with. I have primer/glitter fix products for if I want to apply them directly onto my eyelid, but they are bright neon colours so I'd prefer to use them as eyeliner. So can anyone recommend a product available in the UK that's budget friendly. Maybe I'm not searching for the right thing but the only one I found is 'pigment transformer' by Sleek and the reviews are quite mixed.",

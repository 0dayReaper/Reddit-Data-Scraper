You just need to make it a goal to use those words and after a short while it will seem natural to you and normalize the terms for other people who share your current opinion. Changing how we talk everyday can really change how we think and view the world, and help others address their unconscious  biases as well.

She had gone and created a multi layer covering for our bathroom sink and windowsill with make-up, hair equipment, and accessories and had jewelry arrayed out on the dresser as well.  She complained recently that her jewelry box was too small as well.\n\nWhile we don't live in a \"tiny house\", it's definitely not large, and there's no room for a full sit down makeup vanity.  So, being the typical problem silver male that I am, I dove into research and measuring and found a neat \"over the door\" wall mounted lighted jewelry and makeup cabinet with full length mirror and hung it on the inside of our bedroom door.\n\nWhen she saw it, you'd have thought that I had skinned a puppy and sold our children into slavery.  Needless to say, it got a swift eviction and I spent some time in the dog house.\n\nLesson learned: sometimes, it's not a hint for anything.",

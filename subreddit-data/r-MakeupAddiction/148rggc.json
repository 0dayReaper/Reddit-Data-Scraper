    "postText": "I'm super new to makeup and have seen a ton of different opinions about this, hoping someone can settle it for me! \n\nI want the benefits of a primer, and I want to use a tinted moisturizer (or BB or CC cream) rather than foundation because I want very light coverage. But I've seen people saying there's basically no point in using a primer and BB/CC cream/tinted moisturizer together because a primer would stop the skincare ingredients of the moisturizer from actually penetrating the skin. Is that true? \n\nI use moisturizers and serums already so I don't necessarily need the skincare from the tinted moisturizer but it seems like a waste if it's not getting absorbed? Is there another lighter-than-foundation option without the skincare ingredients?",

I didn't think using a tinted moisturizer or sunscreen would have the same benefits as a primer, I wanted something to smooth out my pores and fine lines and help my makeup last longer, which is why I was looking at a primer, but I'll add tinted sunscreens to the list of options as well.",

Via glycolic acid exfoliation once or twice a week depending on your toleration which can make the pores appear smaller if you keep using it. Cleaning and hydrating your face every night. Etc.\n\nSkin care is exponentially more important more than makeup. With makeup, less is more. And just because you can, doesn't mean you should.\n\nLook up Shelby Wilson and Nikki La Rose on youtube, they have good tutorials for beginners. Both are professional makeup artists.",

Really, makeup is not essential at all, but I figured if I'm going to start wearing it after this many years, I should wear the makeup that has the effects I desire, like smoothing my pores etc. What products other than primer could I use in addition to my skincare to do that?",

            "comment": "This is such a subtle but impactful change \u2014 you look more confident &amp; glowy, too! \ud83e\udd70\n\nI can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re wearing a blush, but if you are, kick it up a notch! Your cheeks are killer and it\u2019s a shame not to get credit for them! With a super light hand, apply some maroon or red blush on the high points of your cheekbones, angled a bit towards your temples. If you\u2019re feelin saucy, you could dust a smidge of it onto the bridge of your nose as well for a summer / sunny look. \n\nYou did a really good job lining your lips &amp; the color is super striking and pretty on you, but I\u2019d use a little less liner on the outer corners of your top lip. A little hard to explain, but curve/fade it down a bit before it gets to the true corner of your mouth. Those areas right now look a little over lined / unnatural, and you have such a pretty natural lip shape, it distracts a bit!\n\nThe manicuring of your brows made a big difference! It can be a little tricky, but you could also experiment with defining them a bit more with an eyebrow pencil to give them a bit more \u201cfullness\u201d within your new shape. \n\nLastly, I know this isn\u2019t strictly a makeup tip, but I\u2019d love to see you with a middle part!",

I have rosacea already, so it's sometimes difficult to make it look not too pink. \n\nI'll definitely try curving the top lip more. It does look a little weird and smudgy.\n\nI've definitely thought about eyebrow pencils and liquids, but for some reason, that side of makeup intimidates me, lol\n\nI've tried doing middle parts before when I had shorter hair, but idk, I feel more insecure when I do the middle part, I feel like it doesn't look quite right\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to write out more tips, I really appreciate it!",

The key is neutralizing the red where you don\u2019t want it, but adding it where it flatters your features. Give it a shot in keeping the area of your blush concentrated to that highest point, start light, and keep building up until you can still see the payoff even when you step back a bit from the mirror. \n\nI also understand about experimenting with a middle part being awkward at first! I had a side part my entire childhood up until I was about 27, and it took me a good week to recognize myself in the mirror lol, but now that I look back, it\u2019s shocking how much it modernized my \u201clook\u201d. \n\nThat said, these are all just tips from an internet stranger, so no pressure if you\u2019re not into it! All that matters is that you\u2019re comfortable and confident in whatever style you want to rock. \u2764\ufe0f",

    "postText": "I just canceled the sale with a Mercari vendor because she didn\u2019t send me my Luxie Rose Gold 5 Kabuki Brush set. It was only $25 and I was thrilled. And now I\u2019m super bummed. I\u2019ve really gotten into using almost cream, everything, applying with my fingers and buffing out with a really nice dunce brush. I know it\u2019s a longshot, but if you have any cheap kabuki recommendations, either on Amazon or off, I\u2019d be super grateful. Specifically, I\u2019m looking for a round top kabuki, a diagonal and an oblong contour.\n\nI\u2019m finally getting the knack of both new make up styles, and doing make up on my older face (then last time I switched it up.) so now I am on the hunt for the right brushes. \n\nAlso, I bought a bunch of really dense kabuki style bullet lipstick shaped brushes on Temu, and they are awesome. I bought one and then went back and bought four more. They\u2019re about two dollars each. I have super hooded eyes and they are amazing for getting in there, depositing color and buffing it out. They\u2019re also really good for concealer.\n\nhttps://share.temu.com/minxo33crxA",

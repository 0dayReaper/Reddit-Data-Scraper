I love that she's got the \"my skin but better\" going on.\n\nEdit: I shall do reddit's thank you kind stranger. Thank you anonymous donor for my little trophy! I've had a really crappy 2020 so far (literally from January 01, 2020 and I wish I was exaggerating) and this is one of the two things that made me smile so far (the other was a silver on a separate comment).

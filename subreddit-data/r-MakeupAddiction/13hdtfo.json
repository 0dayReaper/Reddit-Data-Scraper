I commend you for keeping with it, and gathering your strength to keep being you. \n\nBut also, every time those who are hateful see more of what they judge, somewhere out there is someone absorbing and trying to challenge/change their own views and behavior. You are spreading the change we wish to see. Keep being unapologetically you. \n\nI remember seeing a mom with pink hair when I was around 6-7yo... and it stuck with me forever. That she wasn't \"in trouble\" or \"yelled at\" for looking different (it was way less common then) was wild to me. Something so seemingly small opened up a whole new world of thought for me even at that age. So yeah... I thank you on behalf of that little kid who saw a world of beauty in you.",

I very rarely comment anymore but there's something I feel compelled to share with you. \n\nI just want to say that you're beautiful but it's not just about the way you look. I can't imagine an unkind soul making such beautiful, colourful, uplifting makeup. \n\nAnytime you share a look on here, anytime you pop up in my feed, my day gets a little bit brighter. I can't look at you and be sad, that's like physically impossible. \n\nYou brighten my day with your art, with the inside beauty that shines outwards anytime you share a look. \n\nI hope you remember that when you're sad yourself. I hope you know that, even to strangers, you're important and you bring joy by simply existing. \n\nI very rarely comment. I don't wear makeup much these days but I stay to see people like you \u2665\ufe0f",

    "postText": "I\u2019m new to makeup. I\u2019ve noticed that whenever I put on gel or pencil eyeliner, it straight up will. not. come. off. no matter how hard I try, I\u2019m always left with a subtle dark ring around my eye. which is strange, because liquid eyeliner usually comes off relatively easily with only a bit of residue. I use micellar water btw. trying to rub it off always leaves my eyes stinging and sore, which I know is really bad. I go through at least 4-6 cotton pads every time, and it takes like half an hour before I give up. is it supposed to be this difficult? or are you just supposed to leave it alone at that point?",

Oil based makeup remover, saturate a cotton ball, hold it against your eye for a bit and let it soak and then wipe it away. I like the clinique one but it's pricey for what it is (only use the ones my mom gives me from their gift with purchase sets) also I like the Neutrogena one and they have a store version of the same that I use too and imo is just as good. Or you can use a cleansing balm, which are also oily and help break down oily makeup too.",

I have super sensitive skin and wear longwear liquid eyeliner and waterproof mascara along with false lashes and my favourites so far have been Versed Day Dissolve and The Inkey List Oat Cleansing Balm. I take a tiny dab of product on my ring fingers to gently rub it into my lids and lashes, then let it sit to further break down while I work on the rest of my face before gently rubbing the whole thing off with a damp wash cloth. I do the eye part twice if I am wearing particularly heavy makeup, and after the second pass there's literally nothing left.",

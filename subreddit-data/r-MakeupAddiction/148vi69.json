So far all I got is some lip stick and primer my sis donated to me. I know there is one product that I want in particular and it's some good contour.",

But if you're a beginner, do not get the Rare beauty liquid blush it is not fool proof. Personally I like the merit stick blush, but the rare beauty melting blush would have a similar affect. Stick with products that don't need many brushes.",

I just popped in to say that and to also try out Ulta and more drugstore makeup as you start out with makeup especially until you decide what kind of makeup works for you. Also, there's tons of really good drugstore and midrange makeup. Some better than high-end or at least comparable for most everything I would say except foundation, primer and concealer in my experience and those aren't bad at drugstore just better at high end. \n\nMost importantly, have fun and wear what makes you feel good.",

Griping primer by them is very popular as is their sunscreen mean to be a dupe of the supergoop one. \n\nEssence has great mascara (lash princess especially), eye liner pencils and some eyeshadow palettes for a good price. \n\nMaybelline has the iconic age rewind under eye concealer.\n\n NYX has creamy chubby eyeshadow pencils for the eyes and good brow glue gel. I remember them also having good lip products but I haven't bought any in awhile. \n\nColourPop has really good eyeshadows. I love love love their super shock eyeshadows. They are great for a super quick eyeshadow look. Put a medium brown (or whatever color works for you) shade in the crease and a bit in the outer corner (I prefer to use a powder shadow for this) and then break out a nice metallic, shimmer or glitter Super Shock shadow and put it across your lid with your finger tip and you're done. Obviously, you can do more if you want but it's a nice quick option when in a hurry. \n\nYou'll find great Maybelline and L'Oreal mascaras. I've heard good things about Maybelline's fit for me loose powder but I haven't tried it. \n\nDon't forget to get makeup brushes, sponges (beauty blender or knock off brands are similar enough for me) and an eyelash curler. All are available for affordable prices and decent quality from brands like ELF. \n\nGood luck and have fun!",

            "comment": "Congratulations!! Like others said, answers will vary a lot based on many factors. Plus, all brands have more popular products. Maybe you can think about if you want to avoid brands that support things you are against (animal cruelty, Trump (Nudestix iirc)...). When/if r/Sephora comes back public, I've read many posts about brands people avoid, where you can find this sort of information. Example being many avoid \"clean\" beauty brands as some products (usually liquids and creams) spoil faster from lack of preservatives iirc.\n\n I want to also point out that you should find out what kind of makeup style you like and can visualise yourself wearing and putting on! Natural, classic, bold, anything. Finding styles you like will help you (and any employee) find what you really want. It could be pictures of makeup looks you've seen. Good luck!",

You CNA get a full face of makeup with it because it includes highlights,blushes and many base and contour shades. Very easy to use and great for beginners and experienced ppl 10/10(pls keep it clean tho)",

            "comment": "When my bestie came out I took her to Sephora to get started on some makeup. At the time she was very interested in makeup that would help cover up facial hair shadow until she could get laser, so she was recommended a peach corrector (excellent for this!) and then a pretty heavy foundation. The foundation actually ended up causing some dysphoria for her because it was *so* heavy it made her feel like she was wearing a mask. So my biggest takeaway is, don't let anyone push you into something that doesn't feel right for you!  \n\n\n\\- NARS Orgasm blush looks great on tons of skin tones, definitely test it out.\n\n\\- There are lots of contours on the market, make sure you get one that coordinates with your undertone. if you have a cool undertone, find a cool-toned contour, etc. I'm a makeup fiend and I am fat with a round/chubby face but my favorite contour is honestly the wet n wild MegaGlo Dual-Ended Contour Stick. I only use the dark end (I use concealer to highlight) but it's easy and works really well for me and it's cheap.\n\n\\- You'll probably need to try a lot of things before you find out what works best for you (eg, how much coverage in foundation do you like?) so don't spend too much right away on products that have tons of options.\n\n\\- Brow styling can *really* affect the overall effect of the face, and styling your brows can help feminize your face (and can be a temporary change if you're not yet full-time) so definitely look at brow products. At Sephora I like the Fenty Brow MVP, the ABH Brow Freeze and Brow Wiz pencil, and the Too Faced Fluff and Hold Brow Wax.\n\nHave a great time!",

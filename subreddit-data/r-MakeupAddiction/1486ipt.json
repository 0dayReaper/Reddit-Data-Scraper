I\u2019ve used many different eyeshadows in the 15+ years that I\u2019ve been doing makeup and I feel like this is the same as a colourpop shadow.. \nis there some specific technique I should be using to apply these?",

            "comment": "I agree. I sometimes find the metal plate in the bottom annoying. Heavy feels luxe, but this is almost too heavy and it\u2019s not practical, even for at-home use. I have two which I got on a deep discount. Divine Rose I and Decadence. I think it was around AUD120 or so for each. After using them, I think I would have been happier paying that much for a couple of the wet/dry Tom Ford quads. Maybe it\u2019s my lack of skill, and preferences being less suited to makeup by a makeup artist. \n\nGiven the price I dislike that I have to baby the glitter/fallout. Especially since she sells a primer pen. I refused to buy this. The quality of every shadow should be exquisite and easy for the consumer to use. Her luxury price point doesn\u2019t meet the demands of most luxury consumers (not all, but many want something more user friendly and effortless). If I\u2019m going to pay that much I want perfection.\n\nI try and force myself to use them every now and then because I paid so much. But every time I end up disappointed and not wanting to reach for it again.",

Although Lilas and Peridot are already perfect :) Be careful though if you really intend to do that, they have 3 different pan sizes.

It's just her weird experimentative \"marble\" and  random gel/cream formulas that don't deliver and which annoy me literally everytime I think about them. \n\nI'm wary of picking up a natasha denona palette because I heard her formula is a bit too \"creamy\" and the shades blend into each other kind of like the ABH formula which I'm not a huge fan of but the other day I swatched the glam palette and I was literally in love so idk if I'm going to bite the bullet or what\n\nThanks to this thread I've abandoned the patmcgrath insanity train, thank god\n\nI'm really interested in the charlotte tilbury instant eye palette (12 pan), in starry eyes to mesmerise or any of them really, I heard they're great + better than the quads, but I'd love to know if anyone has any experience with them",

I was so disappointed at how difficult they were to blend out or even together with each other.\n\nSo I just splurged on 3 Natasha denona pallets, and I do love them but I can see what you mean by them being almost too creamy but for me that just means being sure to pick a good eye shadow primer. I got the pastel, retro, and face love pallets. I was very surprised with how much I LOVE THE PATEL PALLET. There\u2019s a few shades that are gorgeous on their own AND as a topper to other shadows. They are creamy but I enjoy the blend ability and how you can mix them so well. I don\u2019t like the ABH pallet I got as much. It\u2019s creamy in a way that almost is like\u2026 slippery with other colors idk but they still look great they just crease a little more. I would choose ND over ABH. Good mix of colors, and it\u2019s not hard for me to find good translation stages which is something I struggle with personally. I would get one of her minis if they appeal to you at all but I don\u2019t regret the purchase so far!\n\nEdit: to add that I agree with an earlier rely too that the trick to ND is not over blending (very hard for me) you really only need gentle blends to make them look great but if you go overboard like I sometimes do like applying more and more layers to \u201cfix\u201d the balance then it can become a whole solid blend hahaha but still looks pretty imo",

The darkest shade is also quite patchy. \n\nAnd yes, I do apply primer and have decent skills. For people saying that you need to learn to work with them and things like that, here's my opinion. If it takes so much work to make an eyeshadow look great... Maybe it wasn't that good to begin with? I expect to put more work into cheaper products, not more expensive ones. \n\nAlso regarding the \"innovation\" of her products, I think you can find more unique eyeshadows at indie brands.

So you can have a dark plum and smoke it out without needing a lighter shadow to diffuse it. The special shades can be duped but that doesn't mean they aren't special. Most of those types of shadow are made by smaller indie makeup brands that aren't widely available like PM's brand. When I use my mothership palettes I always have a really good experience because everything blends effortlessly. Worth the money? No, they are very expensive! I only bought my favourite colour stories at minimum 40% off on her website (which has terrible delivery speed). \n\nAnd about colourpop, they have some really good mattes and some terrible ones. They are pretty inconsistent. Their shimmers/metallics don't hold a candle to PM. They are usually very subtle and dry. I have quite a few colourpop palletes and I only like a handful of the shimmers.",

So I got four palettes basically for the price of one. I was sooooo excited. And then SOOOO disappointed!! The shadows absolutely suck!! No matter what eye primer I use or how I prep my eyes, the mattes have barely any pigment and they disappear and crease within 30 minutes. After an hour you can\u2019t even tell I put a color on my outer v. I\u2019ll admit the specialty shadows are pretty. But the big, bulky and extremely heavy palettes are just not worth the effort.

I tried them. \nThe disappointment I was met with. These did not feel high end. I had fall out in the pans and when using, no natter what method I used. It just didnt seems worth the original price point. \nIve since never bothered and gave them away.",

Yeah, I get that there are heaps of indie brands selling eyeshadows that give the same effect, but I much prefer PMG\u2019s dry/baked formula over wet/squishy ones. It won\u2019t matter to everybody, but I have small, extremely hooded lids so the best formulas for me for longevity are thin, smooth/silky, dry, and not \u2018buttery\u2019. It\u2019s also why I love her satins and metallics - the satins are thin/dry and the pigment is buildable instead of pigmented off the bat, the metallics in Decadence are super foiled without being thick/siliconey so don\u2019t accentuate texture.",

(The Morphe x Ariel set is a good, cost effective set for natural hair) The special shades apply best for me with the use of NYX glitter glue. I use glitter glue for anything sparkly/shimmery regardless of brand, it\u2019s a must have! You may still have *some* fallout from the astral shades, but for me it\u2019s usually a small amount as long as I don\u2019t go ham when applying it and build it up. If it bothers you I\u2019d do your eyes first and wipe away the fallout. You can always use a piece of tape to grab the glitter/astral flakes off of your face. \n\nI hope this is somewhat helpful! \u2764\ufe0f",

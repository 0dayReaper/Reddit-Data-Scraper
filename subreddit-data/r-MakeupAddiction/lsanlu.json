Maybe soften your upper lip by lightly going into the Cupid\u2019s bow area with your lipstick. I think these would keep a bold look but give more attention to your features and femininity :)",

Any time I tried, it honestly just didn't look natural or in any way good with the contours of my mouth. Trends change, but your face is for life :) (hopefully)",

And that lip shape.\n\nIf you're looking for pointers then the only thing I would suggest trying would be not taking the eye shadow all the way up to the eyebrows. That's a bit of an old-school drag move. Maybe try blending it into a neutral base as it gets higher.\n\nThat's just a suggestion for something you might want to play around with.

Now,  I'll often just put some mascara on my lower lashes or if I'm doing a heavier makeup look, I will take one of the thin brushes used for maybe eyeliner (I'm terrible at knowing my brushes...lol), and I will use my eyeshadow to lightly line my lowere lashes. Thick, heavy lines just seem to close eyes up. I have hooded eyelids (it's normal, Google it if you've never heard of it), and I'm not sure if yours were or not? Wayne Goss had an awesome hack on YouTube for doing eyeshadow on hooded eyelids, and I'm sure he has lots of other get eyeshadow tricks and tutorials...\nIt took me years of doing my makeup differently, and trying new things, until I finally found a way that I am happy with and have stuck with for awhile.\nAnyways....YouTube tutorials is where it's at...find out what shape your eyes are, and Google the best ways to apply eyeshadow to them...you'll be a pro soon enough. \ud83d\ude43",

You have beautiful hair and, if you're comfortable, I'd love to see you with it pushed back from your face a bit to get the full scope of your look. \n\nYou have a really strong Gibson Girl/flapper look going on, especially with your chosen red lip, and it really suits your facial features. The eyeshadow and highlight colors take it into a Pat Benatar area, which I also love. \n\nI would suggest perhaps softening the line on your lower lids, or using a deep plum or brown-black line just there. And I think if you line your lips before you apply your lip color, it may give them an even more defined and pouty look. Overall, love it!",

Or vise versa, when doing a bright lip, do just a cat eye with a neutral eye shadow. look at Dita Von Teese, she looks incredible. her night time look is just the same, but with a smokey eye. too much makeup on anyone can age them, or look cartoonish. I feel like the new makeup trend is natural and understated, with brands like Glossier, doing very clean looks, but you can still pair that with some creativity and boldness. Like a natural clean look, with a bright yellow eye liner, or a natural look with bright blue lips. I think this is a great opportunity to find what colors look good on you, but just remember you are already beautiful and don't need to be extreme about it. enhance your beauty, don't hide it! *also an eyeshadow tip, don't fill it in all the way to your eyebrow, stop at your sockets, blend in a lighter shade for under the bow to make them pop.",

Gonna offer some advice for you if that\u2019s ok- when doing makeup, if you\u2019re doing a bold eye, go with a light and if doing a bold red lip do a lighter eye. That\u2019s advice my mama gave me (she was a makeup artist). I love the eye liner as well. It\u2019s very 60s. If you want try blending the under eye liner just a bit if you want it less bold. Again, you are beautiful and did a great job.",

I agree with the people that suggested softer undereye, maybe try an eyeshadow with a thin brush if you can't do it with the pencil you are using (if it's a pencil). Another suggestion would be to use a shade that is close to your skin tone to soften the upper lid eyeshadow and don't bring it that close to your eyebrows, you have a lot of space and that's good. Get more comfortable girl you got this! The colours look good on you!",

I linked my video in the comments but here is a rough description:\n\nI started with the transition shades and I blended them in a tapered shape in the direction of the end of my brow/temple. I then depend the outer edge/outer corner (?) with dark brown and I drew a more defined line which was almost like a border around where my transition shade is high on my lid. I then put the paler shades on my lid. The red shadow was placed close to my lash line. Lastly I used black shadow with a flat brush to shade very subtle wings at the inner and outer corners. I feel like I didn\u2019t explain this well lmaooo",

    "postText": "Hello. I have some pimples and a lot of red spots around my mouth. Lately, I've been putting foundation only around my mouth and nowhere else, because I'm tired of doing my whole face. But I don't know if it looks weird...  I've looked at it in my bathroom mirror, and I took a handheld mirror outside in my backyard. Also went to the salon yesterday and looked in the mirror there. To me, it looks fine and like it matches my skin, but only around my mouth. I've tried putting the foundation on my cheekbone, because I have a big red spot there, but it looked like an obvious spot of foundation. But it looks like it matches my skin around my mouth for some reason. Just worried it doesn't and maybe looks weird in certain lighting. What do you all think? Should I get a different foundation or concealer? I don't really know how to find my perfect shade. I've just been guessing. Thanks :)\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the replies. Just wondering why the foundation looks different on my cheekbone? It looks like an obvious spot of foundation",

My suggestion would be to ask someone for an honest opinion on what it looks like in broad daylight. \n\nIf you\u2019re really worried, what I would do when I had acne on my cheeks was put a light layer of foundation all over, then build it up on my cheeks. I think that made it all blend together really well without having to wear heavy foundation all over.",

I find powder foundation is soooo much quicker to apply. \n\nBut to answer your question you can do whatever you want! Sounds like you\u2019ve checked it looks ok in lots of different lighting, check with a friend or someone who will be honest if you want another opinion.",

Years ago, when I was really into watching makeup artists on YouTube, I was taught by the incomparable Lisa Eldridge about foundation application.  She ALWAYS suggested only applying foundation to the areas you need, then spot concealing.  This is how I apply my makeup.  I only use foundation around my mouth, then concealer under my eyes, then set the eyes and mouth, apply bronzer then blush.",

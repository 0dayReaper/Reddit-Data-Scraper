    "postText": "As someone who was ***very*** curious about these lashes for a long time and was searching reddit for input beforehand, I figured I owed it to the internet to share my experience with these. For context, over the past decade or so I've worn a variety of amazon, ardell, colourpop, saggy curtains, and all kinds of other fake lashes (no extensions though). As much as I loved wearing them all, after a few hours *if not sooner* my eyes would progressively feel and look droopier. It seemed like there was no way around it and when I started wearing glasses regularly, I took about a year or two break from lashes altogether. I figured I was just done with them for good unless I ever decided to wear contacts instead.  \n\n\nI wanted to know if these would feel any lighter on my eyes and moreover, if I could find a pair to fit behind my glasses. Granted, every frame is different but both pairs of lashes were a success!\n\nI purchased:\n\n* Magnetic Liner (black magic)  - serves its purpose and is easy enough to use/glob on there for grip throughout the day. Doesn't peel off your other makeup as badly as regular lash glue yet is easy enough to remove with wipes or a makeup removing balm 8/10\n* Virgo (lashes) with a magnetic band - cute and gets the job done, but definitely better for anyone who prefers a more natural-soft short lash. More of a beginner's lash 6/10\n* Lucky (lashes) with 6 magnets - absolutely GORGEOUS behind my glasses 10/10!!\n\nFirst of all, I lost the anchors in a heartbeat. I had the chance to try them on once and in the process of putting them away I stupidly dropped them into the void that is my carpet. I was so frustrated with myself over losing possibly $15 worth of product but swallowed the situation for what it was eventually. I forget if these were an optional purchase but honestly I'd say I did pretty well without them. When I did try them on briefly it was like they sort of snapped onto my lashes and it definitely wasn't the most comfortable feeling. Imagine using plastic tweezers to just hold your lashes- type feeling.  \n\n\nNeither of the lashes booped my glasses during the entire days that I wore them each out. Both were on there very securely and prior I'd applied a strip of the magnetic liner on top of my regular eyeliner (especially as it was a bit tacky feeling). Worked out perfectly!   \n\n\nMagnetic band &lt; 6 magnet band imo. The 6 magnets felt less heavy on my eyes though both types of lashes were much lighter than any regular pairs I've ever worn! They survived some gnarly winds, but at the end of the day I still had that sweet relief peeling them off lol. Much easier to clean and reuse these lashes too! I noticed the eyeliner just sort of goops/clumps itself off.  \n\n\nTldr; I'm never going back to regular lashes! Give them a try!  Definitely using these on my wedding day! Please let me know your thoughts/experiences/questions as well :)",

    "postText": "Hi all! \u25e1\u0308 I find that within 4ish hours of application, all my of my complexion products are essentially gone from my face. Like it looks as though I have taken a wipe and literally removed it. My skin is pretty normal (maybe even considered slightly dry, never oily). I\u2019m 27f if that matters. I have included my routine below for reference. Any insight you would be able to provide would be so helpful and appreciated\u25e1\u0308 \n\nPrep: wash and dry face &amp; apply thayers toner. Apply Cosrx snail mucin, then Vanicream daily facial moisturizer. Let dry for 10ish minutes \n\nComplexion Makeup (in this order): elf hydrogrip primer, elf halo glow (light layer), either Kosas foundation or Giorgio Armani luminous silk foundation, Tarte ultra creamy concealer, Milk makeup sculpt cream, Rare Beauty Bronzer stick, Becca liquid highlight. I then set with the Kosas Cloud Set (pressed powder) lightly under my eyes, by my nose, and forehead. Lightly set the whole thing with Laura mercier loose setting powder on a fluffy brush. And finish with setting spray. (I have tried SEVERAL setting sprays but I tend to get the best result with Sephora 16hr setting spray - but have used OneSize, Charlotte Tillbury, ELF, Nyx, and Milani Make it Last). It always looks really good for the first like hour or two but really declines from there.  \n\nThank you so much for reading and any insight!",

My pores have shrunk like crazy from that. \n\nIf you need a good exfoliant sfglow makes great exfoliating pads. They also have amazing face masks if that interests you. \n\nIf you are a little on the puffy/blotchy side (you don\u2019t look it from the picture, but idk if you have sinus issues or bad reactions to products) products with hemp oil or cannabis in it work wonders. Pacifica beauty has a serum and a moisturizer. Sfglow also makes face masks with cannabis in it. The Dirty Lamb also has a serum with hemp oil in it. It\u2019s just very calming for the skin. \n\nAlso, always use jojoba oil. It helps make your skin smooth, soft and it prevents wrinkles in the future. (Bonus, you can also use it in your hair to make it soft and shiny)",

I will add individual lashes though. Would love to hear your thoughts!\n\nYou can check out my IG [@marijanadjoricmakeup](https://instagram.com/marijanadjoricmakeup) for more looks :)\n\nSkin:\n\nMUFE Ultra HD Foundation R230\n\nMAC Studio Conceal and correct palette in shade medium\n\nNARS Radiant Creamy Concealer in shade Vanilla\n\nMUFE Ultra HD Loose Powder\n\nBecca Shimmering Skin Perfector Liquid + Powder Highlighter in Opal\n\nAura kozmetika Cheek Stick in Coral Party\n\nkvd vegan beauty Shade + Light Contour Palette\n\nArtdeco Bronzing Powder\n\nMAC Blush in Peaches\n\nEyes:\n\nAnastasia Beverly Hills Sultry Eyeshadow Palette\n\nMUFE Artist Color Pencil in Endless Cacao\n\nMaybelline Lash Sensational Mascara\n\nMAC Shape + Shade Brow Tint in Taupe\n\nAura kozmetika Brow fix gel\n\nLips:\n\nMUFE Artist Color Pencil in Endless Cacao\n\nLisa Eldridge makeup lipstick in shade Velvet Muse\n\nSephora Lipstories lipstick in 3 Qui!\n\nMaybelline lipstick in 50 Baddest Beige\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince many people asked for my skincare routine I'm also adding it here.\n\n\\*My skin is very sensitive, that's why I can't experiment with a lot of products and I try to keep it simple and listen to its needs. Also I have a good skin texture (except a bit of enlarged pores around my nose), but I have a lot of redness on my cheeks. I'm lucky that it's not the other way around, because the redness can be covered with makeup, but the texture not so much. So, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed, but here it goes. :')\n\nI have normal to oily skin. I'm using Bioderma Sensibio micellar water, then Kiehl's Calendula deep cleansing foaming face wash with my Foreo for cleansing. I use Foreo only in the evening, 3 times a week, or If I was wearing makeup that day. After evening cleanse I apply Kiehl's Midnight recovery concentrate and La roche posay Hydreane Legere as a moisturiser. After morning cleanse I apply only LRP and Bioderma SPF 50 (if going outside). Also I try to use some kind of a sheet mask once a week. If my skin feels dry (in the winter) I like to apply Weleda Skin food on dry parts of my face first (usually my cheeks), and then what's left on my palms I press into the rest of m face. When I got spots, I apply La roche posay Effaclar Duo (+) on the actual spots only. And that's about it.",

I'm not quite sure how to describe it, but there's a relatively defined line of darker eyeshadow going our from the corner of your eyes. For me, it gives the make up a bit of a harsher appearance and makes you look a little severe in this photo, imho. Try taking a few photos with different happy expressions to see if it works well in the photos.\n\nBut it is a very striking and well done look. Ultimately it's your wedding day and your makeup so you're the one that needs to be happy with it.",

I did my own makeup too as a bride and my main advice for you is to do several wear tests and photograph and film the look in different lighting and setting (outdoors indoors night day golden hour like here). Take pictures throughout so you have an idea of when you might need touch ups. On the day put a guest in charge of letting you know if anything is wrong with the makeup (shiny, lipstick on teeth etc) so you don't have to worry about it.",

I think a lip with a hint of berry or plum would really make your eye color POP! And I think it may have a better chance standing up in photographs. \n\nBut seriously, this is such a stunning bridal look! Congratulations!",

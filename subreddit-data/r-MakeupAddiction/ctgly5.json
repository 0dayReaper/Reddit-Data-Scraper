Ive tried a look with neon (not anywhere as cool as this!) and my biggest struggle was keeping the center white while still blending the color towards the center. I, very quickly, muddied my colors and got upset. \n\nSeeing your look is inspirational!! Thanks my talented internet friend.",

I LOVE the attention to detail--the really meticulous little downward darts of black between the bottom dots, the crispness and even width of the white highlight, the not-at-all-muddy blend from the black to the bright colors--it's so well done.   \n\n\nAlso, the idea of trying to re-create this on a SECOND eye with that same level of exactness is going to give me a hand tremor just thinking about it. Like the frustration of not-quite-matching wing flicks, but on crack.",

It should work about the same as what you plan to do with UV pigments! \n\nFirst I started off with black gel eyeliner to make the general shape of the eye, then set it with a black eyeshadow so it doesn't fade. Then I surrounded the black with white eyeshadow base and pressed the red, orange, and yellow eyeshadow on top. I do this a few times to really make the colour pop and blend with the black.\nAfter blending the colours out, I use a white liquid liner in the centre of the three colours, and this is what really makes this look like neon.",

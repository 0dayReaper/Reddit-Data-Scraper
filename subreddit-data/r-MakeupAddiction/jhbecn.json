At night I practically drown my entire face and lips in Cerave healing ointment/Eucerin original healing cream and I am ALWAYS wearing either the healing ointment or Palmer's cocoa butter as chapstick during the day. After I do my foundation and powder, I make sure to use a paper towel or rag to rub my lips clean of any residue before I go in with my lipstick/gloss of choice. I also used my Kiko Milano Nude blur lip base today before my lip paint, that may have had an effect.",

If you can\u2019t tell, then it\u2019s more neutral. Maybe some swatches going from your cheek to the middle of your neck to see what foundation shade colors would work better and blends the best (the warmer one, neutral one, or a more cold one, etc). Try sampling some foundations at the makeup store or ask for a makeup store assistant for help, and see what works.",

I can't tell if the sheets are supposed to be white or cream, so that throws things off. \n\nBased off this one arm, and you saying cool toned colors may or may not look good on you, maybe you are neutral or olive toned.",

    "postText": "Hi lovely people,\n\nI'm looking for a lipcolour. I never wear lipstick but I got the comment that my lips are too pale and some lipgloss would look good. I suck at makeup but I googled and I found Mac whirl, and google said that colour looks good on everyone. Is that true? Would that look good? I want something that looks natural so not like red or anything. I bought a lot of lipsticks over the years and I still have a lot at home but I can never get the shade right. It's either way too dark/pigmented or it makes my lips look evrn more pale. I want to get permanent makeup on my lips eventually but maybe I can try a lipstick/gloss first.\n\nDoes anyone know of a brand/colour that would look good? Thank you very much \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc95",

If you're pain, it might be worth speaking to a doctor rather than the clinic. Or call a different clinic that offers it and explain the situation and ask if it's normal? At least then you will know not to go back to that clinic and to demand a full refund.\n\nEyes are precious things... you wanna be careful :)",

If you wear a shade of orange, do you prefer coral &amp; tomato tones, or do you go more for fall leaf and burnt orange ones?",

For each season I believe there are 3 subtypes, so it'd just be a matter of figuring out which you fall into. There are tons of websites that help, and I even have a Pinterest board for my season because there are a bajillion resources on there for seasonal color analysis. Knowing your season will help SO much with choosing makeup colors!!",

They can be very subtle or you can put on several layers on, and they have some really beautiful neutral-pinks that might be what you\u2019re looking for. I\u2019d recommend trying the color Peony or Tiger Lily.

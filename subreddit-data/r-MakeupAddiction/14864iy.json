I would suggest apply a little bit of more contour ( for example Mac Studio fix sculpt and shape contour palette light or the nyx one , or Kat Von D or may I suggest an only product ) apply the contour on your crease as well . The blush I really like but if you want to make an addition to your collection I would suggest Mac Melba/Peaches , Kylie winter kissed and there are many more options.I can\u2019t tell if you used baking powder or powder , and on the market are a lot of options , like huda,fenty,Laura Mercier it really depends on your skin type because a lot of them contain perfume.I love the highlighter too and if you want to make an addition to your collection I truly recommend the Dior backstage highlighter palette 001 , Mac soft&amp;gentle , rare beauty .Eyeshadow looks good and if you want more suggestions, I say beauty bay neutral 42 , makeup by Mario palette , Dior backstage ones , Plouise (all this for a neutral look).My favorite lip combo of the time is Mac lip liner in shade Spice and Mac lipstick please me/velvet teddy , you can put on top your gloss because i think it will suit your skin very nicely,and I really love fenty glosses .Don\u2019t forget practice is very important and your makeup looks very very good , and you are SOOOO SOOO PRETTY \ud83e\udd29\u2764\ufe0f!!Hope this helps you , and I also hope that didn\u2019t offend you!",

            "comment": "Hi! It's a little hard to judge because you're in such bright light and I can't really see what's going on with your skin, particularly the undertones. In any case, three things spring to mind that can help your look overall:\n\n1. You have great lips. I'd ditch the frosty lipstick and lipliner. It's a bit harsh, and actually detracts from the natural fullness. You can still do pink, but I'd go a little warmer and use a buildable product rather than something that's really saturated. Olio e Osso Persimmon would be great on you -- and you can use it on your cheeks, too. ([https://www.olioeosso.com/products/bold-balms?variant=41539039985862](https://www.olioeosso.com/products/bold-balms?variant=41539039985862))\n2. Your lashes and brows are great! For your lids, I'd take it easy on the metallics and go for something that has at most just a hint of shimmer. Ilia's Necessary Eyeshadow Palette in Cool Nude would work well. Of its six shades, two are metallics you can use to spice things up. I have the Warm Nude palette and love it. ([https://iliabeauty.com/products/cool-nude](https://iliabeauty.com/products/cool-nude))\n3. Finally, you have great hair! But I think the middle part and long top layers are weighing your face down. Have you considered bangs? There are some great looks on this page that would work well for you; specifically, looks # 3, 5, and 6. ([https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/beauty/hair/g33267765/types-of-bangs/](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/beauty/hair/g33267765/types-of-bangs/))\n\nFinally, you're a person who can really work a natural look. I wouldn't worry too much about contouring and stuff like that unless you're going out and looking to work a dramatic look. For every day, keep the routine simple. Makeup should enhance your natural beauty (of which you have much!), not weigh it down.\n\nHave fun!",

I had bangs in high school but haven\u2019t had them since and was thinking about getting them again so I may just have to now that you have suggested it too! Thank you again! :)\n\nWould you suggest curtain bangs or layered bangs?",

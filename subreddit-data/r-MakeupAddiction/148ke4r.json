    "postText": "I am at a point in my life where if I\u2019m doing an eye look at all I\u2019m just doing one-shadow looks (I work from home and rarely go anywhere), but I really dig a lot of 90s looks that were just 1 or 2 shades and more of an all-over lid wash. \n\nI love pinkish-brownish shades. I\u2019m currently using MAC\u2019s Haux a lot but I\u2019d love some more options. I\u2019m fine with a matte or satin finish and don\u2019t really care if it\u2019s a single shadow or in a palette. I\u2019m definitely open to cream or stick shadows and love the convenience of them, but a lot of the ones I come across have more shimmer than I\u2019m wanting. \n\nFor reference I have cool undertones and am quite pale, and have issues with a lot of neutral tones skewing orange on me.",

            "comment": "Ooooh, check out K-beauty brands, they do really nice cool toned pinky-browns. I have pretty fair olive skin and even neutral tones tend to look very warm/orangey on me, but the tones in my K-beauty palettes manage to avoid looking orange without looking too obviously pink either. I have a lovely little 10 pan nude matte palette from Rom&amp;nd, it's the Better Than Palette in shade 05 Shade &amp; Shadow Garden. It's mostly lighter shades, but there are plenty of other similar palettes on the K-beauty market if you're looking for deeper shades.",

The color is a really flattering pinky brown with a slight satin finish, so I feel like it adds some depth without looking too shimmery. It\u2019s a cream formula, so I like to apply it all over my lid with my finder, and then I blend it out with a fluffy brush. I also find that it sets really nicely for a cream and doesn\u2019t really crease.",

Tease is a slightly darker version of this,  more cool brown mauve. (FYI I have fair,  neutral coloring. ) \n\nUrban Decay also has some versions of this in a few of their palettes",

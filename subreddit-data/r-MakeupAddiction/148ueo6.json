    "postText": "I am on a quest to find a good color corrector for my under eyes to hid dark circles. **Next on my list to try is Bobbie Brown stick color correctors.**... if anyone had any luck with those. I know a light peach is my color.\n\n\\*\\*\\*My fav under eye brightener has always been Becca's cause it's hydrating and works under concealer. But, it's too pink to be a corrector for me.\n\n\\*\\*Didn't adore: Neutrogena Corrector, Skin Food Salmon Corrector( not bad at all... but didn't cover dark circle 100% and didn't layer well), and Catrice under eye brightener ( i know it's not a corrector.... but it's not as hydrating as my Becca's or bright)\n\nSo what is ur fav color corrector for your dry under eyes?",

            "comment": "I have the Bobbi Brown stick in Bisque and I love it. It\u2019s the only one I\u2019ve found that doesn\u2019t cling to dry patches (including NARS radiant creamy). I will get a little darkness peeking through in the bottom of my tear trough but it seems like only I notice lol. I like the formula a lot better than the old pot formula, which creased a lot for me vs the stick.",

About 80% of the year I\u2019m the lightest pink shade and it\u2019s perfect! The other 20% is summer when I get a bit of a tan (really not much) and go to the medium.\n\nAlso depending on the color you\u2019re trying to neutralize a yellow corrector like [Ole Henriksen Banana Bright Vitamin C++ stick](https://olehenriksen.com/products/banana-bright-vitamin-cc-stick?variant=42348460736684) may work better. \n\nBest of luck! \ud83c\udf40\ud83c\udf40\ud83c\udf40",

Bought a mini of my Nars concealer in a corrector shade and never turned back. It\u2019s guaranteed to layer well with your concealer because it\u2019s the same formula.\n\nAnother option is to buy the elf camo corrector in peach and mix it with a bit of your concealer to make the perfect shade.",

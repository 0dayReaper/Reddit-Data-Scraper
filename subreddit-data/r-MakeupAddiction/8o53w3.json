She was apprehensive at first because she is very set in her ways with regards to her makeup routine and this was the first time she has ever let me do a full face on her. She\u2019s basically been doing more or less the same thing since the 70s.\n\nUsually she wears just a tinted spf, a dab of concealer, some green mascara and maybe green eyeliner (I\u2019ve been trying to get her to change up her green mascara the whole of my adult life!) and a very pink toned lipstick, all of which didn\u2019t flatter her that well in my opinion.  \n\nShe actually sat for me really patiently and let me do my thing, which I was amazed by because she\u2019s not one to be poked and prodded \ud83d\ude02 - but she loved the end result and keeps asking me to show her how to recreate it. She especially loved how the lashes and shadow defined her eyes and I think I may have finally got her to at least consider other colour palettes than baby pink and green! ",

I will actually have to ask her when I speak to her later as she went home very soon after I applied her makeup, so sadly I didn\u2019t get to see how it wore throughout the day, but she at least didn\u2019t mention creasing. You\u2019re right in that anything too thick doesn\u2019t sit well in wrinkles. I used a lot of moisturiser and strobe, which helped with her overall tone, and primed her eye area with a silicone based primer - this can go a little way towards helping make the application in wrinkled areas smoother I find, and helps it stay put.\n\nBut as far as foundation goes, I used a very light touch with the Bobbi Skin Foundation and focussed more on colour correction where it was needed. I am not a fan of using foundation for coverage in any makeup, it takes a bit longer but I would rather take the time to conceal and colour correct thoroughly and leave the majority of the skin with light coverage. Also powder really sparingly with a small brush and try to avoid powdering over wrinkled areas at all \ud83d\ude0a",

Lately ive been mixing it w Estee Lauder dblwear flawless concealer to smooth it out a bit (which itself alone would sometimes need a setting powder) \n\nKat von d lock it is good too and also doesnt typical need a setting powder. \n\nMACstudio fix also doesn't need a setting powder *at all* but its coverage isnt as good and it sets too quickly before i get a chance to blend it out \n\nWhatever you use- moisturize the hell out of your undereye \n\n\n",

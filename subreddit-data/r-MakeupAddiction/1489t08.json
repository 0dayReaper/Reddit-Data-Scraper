    "postText": "Hello all, I\u2019m not sure if this is the right sub to post this in but I am in dire need of help. I\u2019m looking to buy some false eyelashes to surprise my wife with. She has loved to go all out for her makeup for years and has developed an allergy to both eyelash glue and eyelashes themselves because of a lash tech that infected her eyes. Since this happened she hasn\u2019t been able to go all out like how she loves to and it breaks my heart. I have found an hypoallergenic eyelash glue that has helped her a lot but she still gets the allergy that bruises her eyes so we believe it\u2019s the eyelashes themselves. I\u2019ve tried Google for recommendations and so far any silk/advertised hypoallergenic eyelashes have not helped. She likes to wear big lashes that don\u2019t have a natural look which limits our options even further. I\u2019ve linked a picture of the style she likes. Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd",

            "comment": "I wonder how did the lash tech infect her eyes and is there a chance to fix the infection instead of changing the glue and lashes? However I know a brand called \u201csister nature\u201d. Their lashes are handmade with 100% natural hair (or at least that is what their site says) and they\u2019re also contact lens friendly and cruelty-free! Sister nature does have lash glue too. I\u2019ve been using their lashes for like two years now and they\u2019re really good. This is such a sweet idea to surprise your wife tho, wishing you luck!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ku9qdfrb9r5b1.jpeg?width=828&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c49c6ecfb42141fe4146995337275816f4a3e9c9",

The eye doctor just gives eye drops when it gets bad and a cream to put on her eyelids. We have no idea why after so long her eyes are still so sensitive to it.",

I'm very allergic to many adhesives so an adhesive claiming to be \"hypoallergenic\" is immediately suspect to me. She should try the glue without any lashes on a different body part to see if she still gets a reaction, then eyes with no lashes to confirm it's not the lash glue.",

Switched to cheaper one than UD recently (Nyx) but have used the all-nighter several days in a row before. However I have pretty oily skin\u2014if you don\u2019t produce much oil the spray can be drying, because they typically contain alcohol or similar ingredients to make sure the excess moisture evaporates quickly.",

I don\u2019t think Mac fix+ will do what you\u2019re wanting, it\u2019s supposed to be to melt the products together on your skin (or something like that) not necessarily make it last. I like the urban decay but I\u2019m pretty oily so it works for my skin. I think I prefer it over the Charlotte Tilbury. Charlotte Tilbury keeps my makeup on all day but I have to powder right after spraying it or my skin looks too dewy (or oily in my case). I also have the Benefit Porefessional and the Milani Make It Last. I\u2019d go with UD or CT depending on your skin type.",

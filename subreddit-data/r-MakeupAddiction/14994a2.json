    "postText": "Hi everyone! \nAbout a month ago I had my first bridal trial (actually first time ever getting my makeup done professionally,) and it didn\u2019t go too hot. I was going for the soft glam, light -ish makeup look that is really popular right now. The MUA went way overboard on the bronzer, like just swirled it all over my face.. and I left looking like a clown with a weird rash. Wedding planning has been a little rough on my anxiety and I was excited for the trial, so It was discouraging to say the least. \nI recently just had my second trial with a make up artist who seemed to follow my inspiration pictures, much more closely . I was really happy with the look! My only concern is my skin is kind of a cool olive tone, so it\u2019s hard to match foundation. Could you guys CC the new look? I wasn\u2019t sure if the foundation looked too off from my neck/ chest? My dress has a deep neckline as seen in the photos. (Wedding date is September so could also have more of a tan by then?)",

Let me tell you how often brides are not hot.\n\nA lot.\n\nYour MUA is a hack. if 2/8 is their work than its moronic.  \nwhat ever you did in the other pics is perfect.  \nI think you'll rock it just fine. Your foundation match is good. There is no such thing as perfect.",

Or try falsies you buy from a drug store, Sephora, ULTA, etc. same thing just need to reapply",

If you do it too much it can damage them but it\u2019s just like any other hair, you bleach your hair too much it\u2019s damaged. A lash lift is essentially perming solution so it\u2019s rearranging the bonds to get them to stay curled! Now lash extensions that\u2019s another story I\u2019m not too familiar with but I do know of you take care of them and properly remove them you have less chance of damage to your natural lashes",

I did lash lifts for about a year because my lashes are super long but downward straight and honestly although it looked beautiful it did mess with the health of my lashes. Once they're permed/lifted you can't curl them because they're delicate so even if you stop doing the lifts you have to wait a while to resume lash curlers so you don't damage them further. To be on the safe side i waited like 6 months but I've noticed some of the lashes that fell out throughout the sessions didn't totally grow back so now they're kinda sparse on one eye and still full on the other. I wish they still looked curled like they did with the lifts but sometimes I wish I hadn't touched them :(",

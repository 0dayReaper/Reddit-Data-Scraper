The shades will,blend to your skin, so each shade will match multiple skin shades and tones. \n******Under Eye- Becca by Smashbox Under eye Brightening Corrector\n******Shadow- I use a crayon- Either Rose Gold by Laura Mercier or Rose Colored Glasses by 20/20 Beauty\n******Liner-I use a dark brown liner to line my upper water line to make my eyes stand out more and to make my lashes look thicker.  Right now I a using a Sephora brand one.\n*******Under Eye-  Lightly line with a mid tone color similar to the shadow crayon, or I take a liner brush and run it across the pencil and use that.  \n***** Mascara- I like to curl my lashes.  For a very light look, I use the Besame cake mascara or If I look sleepy, I use one coat of Roller Lash by benefit.  \n\nIf nothing else, try the Erborian CC Cream it\u2019s my new HG!",

A subtle peachy or pink blush would also look good on you and give your face a little more oompf. And maybe a little lip stain to keep it natural and simple. \n\nI would put less highlighter in the inner corners of your eyes, though. It doesn\u2019t really match the more natural look of the rest of your face. Save it for when you\u2019re going all out with eyeshadows and lashes.",

I would suggest a sheer foundation with added SPF, along with a lightweight concealer (NYX makes an affordable serum one I like that I often use as a light foundation) for under eye darkness and any spot treatment. An eyelash curler can do a lot for your look by helping the lashes stay curled and helping your mascara show more. I\u2019d add a cream\nblush in a soft-coral pink or a dark rose color (Milani makes some nice ones) - but applied higher than you think you should, and no further in than your irises. This can also double as a lip color or an eyeshadow. Highlight on those now dewy cheeks, and under your brows would really up the ante.",

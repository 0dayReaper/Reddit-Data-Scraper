I you choose to over line, make sure you're concentrating that shape towards the top bow and bottom center of your lips. When you over line the bottom outside edges, you start to get a wobbly shape. The bottom center dips inward too much, which looks unnatural. Basically you get a bum shape instead of a bowl shape.",

Hopefully that makes sense haha",

Don't use powder for it, as it can make the skin look even more bumpy. If you only have eyeshadow you can mix that with setting spray or water (although im not sure how good that is) to make a paste and spread that over the area. It takes some practice to get the right amount, but that will come with time. Then go over with concealer, and hopefully the tones should be evened out enough. when you apply the concealer it is best to use a sponge to pat it on. I put dots all over the area and pat until it's even, because if you just spread with fingers it can disturb the layer below. if there's still a little shadow you can go back over with blush and concealer again but be very careful. also put moisturizer on before and let it dry a little otherwise it can be prone to cracking if you have dry skin like me. I hope that helps, if you have any other questions message me if you'd like or there should be some good tutorials on youtube.",

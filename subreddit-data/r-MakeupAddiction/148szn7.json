Not the easiest thing to do! The combination usually saves me from impulse buys, but when I was at CVS the other day picking up who knows what, I remembered Jessica talked about this pretty little thing, and immediately to self checkout I went. \n\nShe\u2019s been raving about a rosy peach shade from Maybellinefor years, but just recently introduced Nude Glow to the mix, and more importantly to my life. You guys, I\u2019m hooked.\n\nSure, there\u2019s more intense bronzey champagne\u2019s out there, BUT what this black compact lacks in wow factor she makes up for in wearability. As you can see from the swatch she\u2019s the perfect balance of metallic, satin, and shimmer, which for $3? Like, you can not be beat that. I love her on a lazy, one and done shadow day, but I\u2019m also a sucker for anything that lets people think I tried a lot harder than I actually did.",

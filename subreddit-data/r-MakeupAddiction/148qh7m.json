    "postText": "Hello everyone! I have severe dark (or rather brownish) circles around my eyes and I think they are a genetic thing. Usually I cover them with foundation and concealer (I use the one from Catrice) but they are still noticeable. It prevents me from using dark eyeshadow tones because they immediately highlight the \u201cdarkness\u201d under my eyes \ud83d\ude00\nLong story short, here are my questions:\n1) Do skin-whitening creams for the under-eye area actually work? If yes, which one could you recommend?\n2) I use a concealer from Catrice, shade nr 7, since it\u2019s the only shade that I found perfectly suitable for my skin colour. However, maybe there are one with better coverage? Could you recommend any?\n\nI am based in Europe so would be great if you recommend something I could actually order here. Thanks!",

Been learning how to do makeup for the past 6ish months, but I'm looking to do a simple no-makeup makeup look for everyday so I can practice more with application.\n\nMy skin is so dry, even with skincare, so keep that in mind :)\n\nAs a bonus any tips for what eyeliner for my eye shape would be great! My face is on my profile page!",

Use hydrating products for your primer, foundation and concealer so that all blend well together. (water based products work well for me) i use the milk hydrating primer, elf camo concealer and elf flawless satin finish foundation!",

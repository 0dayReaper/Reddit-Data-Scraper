            "comment": "Definitely prefer the fenty, you get more product for the price, and i cannot stand the way the lifter glosses smell, it's almost like a artificial cappuccino imo? But they do both feel amazing on the lips and are longwear.\n\nMy personal fav lipglosses are the fenty, tower28, kosas lip oils (more of a smooth glossy feel rather then an oil) and lip injection for plumping \u25e1\u0308",

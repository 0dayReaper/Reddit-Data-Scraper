That said, there are general things to evaluate if you think a product might be spoiled: smell, color, texture, consistency, age, and possible contamination.\n\nSmell: is there an unusual smell - something sharp, musty, yeasty/bread-like, sickeningly sweet, or otherwise unappealing? Has the smell changed from what it was the last time you used it?\n\nColor: has the color changed, gotten more dull, become inconsistent, or look inconsistent from one identical product to the next? Are there patches or spots that are a different color (especially black, white, or green/blue)?\n\nTexture: is the product the texture you are expecting, or has it changed? Has it become sticky, viscous, hard, chalky, gritty, chunky or goopy/clumpy? \n\nConsistency: Is it dried out, melted, crumbled, crystalized, etc.?  Does it vary from one identical product to the next?\n\nAge: is it brand new unopened, or something you've had for a while? How long has it been opened?\n\nContamination: is it a product that can facilitate bacterial growth (i.e., anything creamy, liquid, gel, or otherwise wet)? Is it something that can be sanitized (powders, pencils, bullets)?\n\nWhen in doubt, throw it out - especially eye products.",

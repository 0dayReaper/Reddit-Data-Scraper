    "postText": "i have this type of fold (i have asian eyes) that i don\u2019t really ever see in tutorials, i feel like if i try falsies it might be difficult/poke into my eye? since when i open my eye the fold goes over/covers the entire inner part.\n\ni\u2019ve never used them before so i was wondering if i could get some opinions!",

            "comment": "Yes you can. I have monolids and wear big lashes all the time. You must cut all lashes to fit your eye shape regardless. What I do is I cut much shorter than the length of my eye, because that fold of skin in the inner corner of your monolids is gonna rub against the band and cause a lot of uncomfortable friction whenever you open your eye, close it, move it. \n\nBuy eyelashes from Asian beauty brands; Doe Lashes, The Petite Club (brand owned by YouTuber Tina Yong). These brands will make lashes SPECIFICALLY for monolids. They\u2019ll make thinner bands, different kinds of lashes, and lashes that would suit your eye type more than brands geared towards a Western audience.",

These are Ardell and the bands are a big stiff so you can see the lashes seem to lay straight on my eye and bend my upper lid. Not too uncomfortable, but I had to trim the band and inner lashes.",

    "postText": "Hi! I'm doing a product design project for school and my chosen prompt is to design something for men and/or people with facial hair who love makeup. If anyone falls under either of those categories and would be willing to answer any of these few questions, I'd be so grateful! (note: when I say \"man\" it is being used as an umbrella term for anyone with masculine features and/or anyone with facial hair. gender and sex doesn't matter! just looking for people who fall in the designated categories)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. What are some cosmetic steps that you find are difficult (more specifically because you are a man)?\n2. If you have facial hair, do you get bothered by makeup in your beard? if so, how do you avoid getting it in your beard?\n3. Are there things or products you wish existed that would help solve the problems you have as a man wearing makeup?\n4. Have you noticed any market gaps (missing products or opportunities for products) for men interested in cosmetics?\n\nThank you to whoever shares their answers!",

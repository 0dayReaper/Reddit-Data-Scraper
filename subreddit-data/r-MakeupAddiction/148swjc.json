    "postText": "hi all, I was getting professional eyelash extensions done for almost a year but recently developed an allergy to them which sucks so I\u2019m not going to get them done anymore. I\u2019ve used magnetic lashes in the past and liked them a lot better than the typical lashes with glue. Any recommendations for temporary lashes for everyday wear? Easy, quick, voluminous (preferably any good recommendations for sensitive eyes. Idk how I developed this allergy after getting them done 6x before experiencing severe allergies.)",

I think KISS just came out with pre-glued lashes that work like falscara and they come in a few different kinds, I like those.",

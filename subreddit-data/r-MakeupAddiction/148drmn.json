    "postText": "I recently bought a orange colour corrector for my dark under eyes/ sunken eyes after I saw someone with my complexion use it.\nFor clarification, I have brown skin tone. However, I\u2019ve been looking sort of red. Maybe it\u2019s to do with my undertone since I think I\u2019m neutral/cool?? I really don\u2019t know.\nI\u2019ve heard some people use green colour correctors but I\u2019m not sure if that will work with my skin tone.\nAny advice? Thanks!",

    "postText": "I fear I have lost my makeup bag, the last place I have to check is my desk at my office but I'm pretty sure I accidentally left it somewhere else \ud83d\ude2d I have a couple of things at home, but no longer have the following and am open to trying something new (because why not). Any recommendations would be great, only restriction is under $40/product. Need bronzer, highlighter, small eyeshadow palette, eyeliner, face brush set, eye brush set. Other items I will directly replace or have a backup already. And ugh now I guess I need a medium sized makeup bag too (my old one I got on sale from Sephora and it was PERFECT, I think I'm most upset about losing the bag itself)",

I use it all over for a fresh glow.\n\nMy favourite eyeliner is Sephora collection kohl pencil. \n\nHuda beauty makes some great smaller palates. Of course price wise, can\u2019t go wrong with colourpop. \n\nGood luck!",

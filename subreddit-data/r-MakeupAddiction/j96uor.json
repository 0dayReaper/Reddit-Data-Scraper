The depression comes with poor eating, vacant expression/eyes, very inconsistent hygiene, unchanged pillowcases, dirty clothes. I also tend to pick more at the acne I have then. Basically it's anything bad for skin you can think of. It makes it a huge difference when all these factors change, practically overnight. \n\nThe dermatologist didn't know all of that though, because we had never met. I honestly believe a wicked big factor is the huge boost in self confidence and generally acting way happier, which draws in people.",

Depending on your insurance situation, it might be more cost-effective to go the Rx route. It\u2019s a little odd they would have an age limit, I think you should inquire because it\u2019s an actual medical condition. You can also get the prescription and buy it using a GoodRx coupon. A single 45g tube can last me a year. \n\nDifferin (Adaplene) is an OTC alternative that used to be Rx only. Another one that I personally recommend to those starting off is A313 Pommade (available on Amazon). It\u2019s sold OTC in France and the formulation is mild compared to tretinoin but is still very effective. I think it\u2019s a really great way to build up your tolerance before jumping into tretinoin.",

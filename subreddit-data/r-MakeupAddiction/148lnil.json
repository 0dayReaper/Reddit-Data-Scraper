            "comment": "I did my own wedding makeup for my wedding in the hottest day of the year. Here\u2019s my tips to make it last. \n\n1. Wedding favorite foundations are favorites for a reason. Are you getting married outside in the summer? Est\u00e9e Lauder Double Wear. Make sure you get as close a match as you can, the more coverage you use the more obvious a mismatch is. This is the foundation I wore and it was flawless. \n\n2. Primer for everything; face, eyes, lashes etc. my favorite primer is the Illamasqua Hydra Veil. It\u2019s slightly tacky and also hydrating. Spray setting spray or MAC Fix+ generously between layers and allow it to dry all the way before continuing. Skindinavia Bridal spray is what you want. \n\n3. Set your cream products (bronzer/contour, blush, highlight) with powder products. Creams don\u2019t have the longevity to hold up all day. \n\n4. Go a little bit heavier on your makeup than you think you should; getting photographed washes you out. A little more bronzer, a little more blush.\n\n5. If you are wearing a liquid lip, apply it at the last moment so you are less likely to get crusty. I put my makeup on at 10am and didn\u2019t have the ceremony until 4:30pm. \n\n6. Your wedding day is not the time to try something new! Practice your look or technique multiple times *before* the big day so you have a plan and know what you\u2019re doing. \n\n7. The above being said, wear your makeup how you like and don\u2019t try to be something you\u2019re not. If you normally wear light makeup, don\u2019t do a heavy full glam for your day. You won\u2019t feel or look like yourself. If you normally wear goth grungy makeup, don\u2019t go for soft neutrals. Etc and so forth. I love a red lip so I wore a red lip. \n\n8. Use a good powder to set your face. Paired with a good primer and setting spray, it won\u2019t budge all day. I used Laura mercier. \n\n9.  Avoid touching your face as much as you can! The oils on your skin will break down your makeup faster, not mo mention physical removal from touching. \n\n10. Do your makeup before your hair if possible, to avoid having to move any face framing pieces out of the way for application. \n\nAnd bonus, get a bridal buddy to wear under your skirt! It\u2019s like a mesh underskirt with arm holes to tuck your dress skirt into. It makes going to the bathroom in your wedding dress simple af!",

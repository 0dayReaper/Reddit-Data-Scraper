    "postText": "I've never really used them. I feel like they're the biggest area of makeup that mystifies me still. I've always just used lipstick/gloss without it. \n\nSo... What's the point? What are the benefits? How do you use them? What (affordable) brands do you like? Are products like ColourPop's lippie stix interchangeable with lip pencils?",

            "comment": "It\u2019s funny you say that because I feel incomplete without wearing lip liner, I have been for the past 14 years.\n\nThe point/benefits are lip pencil gives you precision to map out the shape of your lips. You can decide to easily over-line or under-line the lips with lots of ease and control. For older ladies it also helps with lipstick or gloss from bleeding or migrating outside of the lip perimeter and into fine lines around the mouth. As well if you want to create a look with more depth you can choose a shade slightly darker than your lipstick, just make sure to blend the lipstick in with the pencil. \n\nI\u2019ve never worn Colorpop makeup so I can\u2019t speak to that.  I can say though that MAC &amp; Pat McGrath Labs make some of the best lip pencils I\u2019ve ever used! They are just waxy enough without being too dry and just creamy enough without being too soft.",

It's good to know about them preventing migration - I don't think I have any wrinkles there yet, but I'm sure it'll be relevant eventually.",

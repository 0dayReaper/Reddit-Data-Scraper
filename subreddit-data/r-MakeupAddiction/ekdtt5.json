If you don\u2019t like the feel of waterproof mascara, I have found Lanc\u00f4me defencils to stay on pretty well. Lanc\u00f4me really does make the best mascara!

Is that not a word?) is to skip moisturizer that morning and use a small amount of a light finishing oil only. Moisturizer will slide the foundation right off your face by the end of the day especially with the slightest amount of heat or sweat. Play with that a bit and see if you like it. Also, urban decay and morphe (I\u2019m sure others too) have makeup setting sprays that help maintain everything for a good 24hours+!\n Also, maybe the lip color is pulling cooler bc of the lighting? The rest of your face towards the bottom looks lighter as well so maybe the lip color is perfect it\u2019s just the lighting is off.\n\nRegardless, you are stunning! Congratulations on your big day. You could go bare faced and still look incredible, you have lovely features \ud83d\ude0a",

Your eyes are already stunning and the black will make them pop just that bit more. Also, don't forget your tightline! Use black and it'll help blend your eyelashes to your eyeliner, and make them look thicker and darker. Everyone's already said the lipstick is too cool, but try a warmer pink or brown, maybe with gold undertones so it matches the eyeshadow.\n\nThe main thing is to remember to blend down your neck and your ears. You don't want red ears and a normal face, or your face to be a different color than your neck. You don't have to blend all the way down, just around the jaw. Otherwise, you look gorgeous!",

My one recommendation (and this is just based off my own personal preferences, so obviously you can feel free to ignore me) but I would probably go a bit lighter on the brows - I personally like a more natural brow look, and also since this is for your wedding, typically it is recommended to go for a more \u201cclassic\u201d makeup look rather than a really trendy look - so that way, 20 years from now when you\u2019re looking at your wedding photos, you don\u2019t cringe because what was cool and trendy at the time of your wedding has gone out of style - and I feel like bolder brows are very trendy now but might go out of style in the future.

Might I suggest, just for wedding photos, I would suggest going a bit thinner on the fill in on the brows because they may show up a bit bold for the photos. Also, the contrast of how light the chin is to the contour on the forhead. I would add some more countour under the jaw line and chin, and some more highlight (not highlighter, but lighter concealer) the the middle of the forhead. \n\nOther than that I think this is an absolute gorgeous look for a wedding, and you are absolutely beautiful.",

I think fixing that will make a big difference. The only two things I would contribute: 1. make your blush a *little* stronger. pics wash you out, so you almost want to look \u201cclownish\u201d (not really, but you get what I\u2019m saying). 2. A slightly different lip shade and finish. I think this is too ashy for the eye makeup, and I think satin looks better than matte. You could even just get a satin color to put on top of whatever matte lip you get, as the matte will wear well, but the satin will look better in pics. \n\nCongratulations on your engagement and upcoming nuptials.  Please keep us posted with any changes, and hopefully you will share a pic of the final result on your big day!!",

Your skin looks great but sometimes dewy skin doesn't wear super well so lots of setting spray. On the day bring a little touch up kit with a couple q tips, some concealer/sponge and your lip priducts with you so you can fix anything if you need.  Another thing if you haven't taken it off yet is wear it for a while.. itll tell you how itll wear on your day and if you need a but more powder to lock everything into place.",

Definitely try some colour corrector around the mouth - real common for certain skin tones to need a lil bit when applying foundation (be careful about the ingredients in the one you buy though- i bought one with hidden coconut oil in the ingredients and it broke me out awfully). Also for the eyebrows an easy way of muting them is to get some powder on a beauty blender and pat it over them - sounds weird but when you brush away the powder after a few mins they're set nicely and tend to dominate the face less but are still defined and thick! \ud83d\udc95",

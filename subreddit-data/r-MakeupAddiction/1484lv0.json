I thought itd look like an ugly orange on me but it\u2019s GORGEOUSS. For bronzer on the far area your forehead around your hairline and if you want, cheeks as well. I\u2019d look at a reference for a better demonstration, apply lightly and build it up and blend however you like. You can use the excess on your brush to apply to your eyelids as \u201ceyeshadow\u201d\n\nLike so: https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0026/0122/2190/files/Blog_1_600x600.jpg?v=1657813392\n\nhttps://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/how-to-contour-graphic-1559935702.jpg",

I had no idea what to even do with bronzer, and so many do their makeup differently. That's also a good tip, with the bronzer being used as eyeshadow, because I hardly use any color as is. Thank you, I'm going to save these",

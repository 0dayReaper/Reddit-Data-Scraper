And considering I have a fro hawk and it's Winter here - yes, all day long!\n\nIt basically allows me to be lazy, yet stylish at the same time. Ha!\n\n**EDIT:** \n**It's midnight here and I have to go to sleep. I'll be back tomorrow to answer any more questions you super crew might have and I'll be posting consistently in this group with ALL the fun things I do!

KVD's Bruno is another favorite but it's long gone by now but I bet there's some dupes out there. \n\nI second Makeup Monsters' Wipeout. I don't know if it's still available but I know they still have some blues and greens. I adore their formula. It's so comfy and wears so well. ",

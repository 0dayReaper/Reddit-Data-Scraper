    "postText": "Hi everyone! \n\nI have combination acne-prone skin. My forehead and nose are extremely oily, while the rest of my face is normal with a tendency to get easily dehydrated. \n\nI used to wear the Fenty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Longwear Foundation and swear by it, however lately it has not been working for me. It does nothing to control my oily zones, while it clings to my dry patches everywhere else. \n\nBecause of this, and since my skin is clear and I have no acne or hyperpigmentation, I decided to switch to the Nars Pure Radiant Oil Free Tinted Moisturizer. This looks great on my cheeks, chin and upper lip, but of course my nose and forehead still get oily. I use the Fenty Invisimatte blotting powder to blot the oil, but I really don\u2019t want to have to powder every hour. \n\nBecause of this I thought I should maybe get a mattifying primer. But I\u2019m not sure which one to buy. Should I use it all over my face? Only on my oily areas? Or should I get two different primers? Also, from my research on this sub, I think I need a silicone based primer that has no talc and no alcohol (because these can dehydrate my skin and make me even oilier). Any suggestions? I was thinking about Benefit\u2019s Porefessional but I have seen a lot of comments saying it\u2019s not that good for its price, however it is the only one I have found that fulfills the requirements.\n\nThank you all! Have a nice day!",

The ones that worked well for me were all by Make Up For Ever. They sell mini versions of their primers if you don't want to commit to full sizes.",

(The formula of their hydrating primer I used years ago, as I recall, didn't contain it.)\n\nSmashbox Photofinish Control is silicone-based. You could also try their regular Photofinish primer (all silver tube) which is very silicone-heavy (no water).",

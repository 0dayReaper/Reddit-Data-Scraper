I know waterproof mascara obviously, but I\u2019m worried about my base getting smudged\nAnd if I powder too much it\u2019ll make those tear stream lines down my face if you get what I\u2019m saying. Thank you \ud83e\ude77\ud83e\ude77",

Sounds odd but I was determined to keep my face together for him one last time but was obviously gonna cry. I use Mac Russian Red lipstick and it wouldn't shift in a Nuclear War.",

It\u2019s not for daily use but [Ben Nye Final Seal](https://www.amazon.com/Final-Seal-Matte-Makeup-Sealer/dp/B005MZ4A7C/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?crid=R621DT69SPBV&amp;keywords=ben+nye+final+seal&amp;qid=1686716691&amp;sprefix=ben+nye+final+%2Caps%2C144&amp;sr=8-1) is amazing. I\u2019ve used it for funerals, my wedding (I\u2019m a cryer), and other poignant events. I\u2019m almost positive you could swim in the Atlantic without your makeup moving. \n\nLast suggestion is to carry a small pack of tissues and remember to blot, not rub!",

    "postText": "I LOVE my collection, I mean I LOVE it, but my kidneys are failing me. My doctor didn\u2019t tell me to, but I want to eliminate any toxic chemicals out of my beauty routine. After all, our skin is an organ and id rather be safe than sorry if it extends my life for one more second. I\u2019m seriously considering just starting over with a few pieces of clean makeup and homemade skin care and just using it til it\u2019s gone or expires and replacing it as I need to. What should I focus on replacing and what isn\u2019t really a big deal? (Like ditch the chemical laden foundations but keep the eyeshadow since I use a primer or what?) I\u2019ve always rolled my eyes at the notion of clean makeup and skincare but now that I\u2019m in this situation idk. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m panicking or doing something I\u2019ll regret or being smart and making the right healthy choice. What can I use for a safe spf? HELP!\nEDIT: For clarity I am 5\u20197\u201d 43F 140lb (down from 165 lb of solid muscle,gym rat lol) with a history of papillary thyroid cancer so no obesity diabetes or high bp. Not suggesting my makeup is causing my kidney failure but not wanting to further strain them since my skin is a giant organ. I\u2019m also ditching lotion body wash shampoo detergent and deodorant for natural alternatives.",

I\u2019d be more concerned about what you\u2019re putting IN your body, not what you\u2019re putting on your face.",

I think you\u2019re going to regret it if you get rid of your makeup collection. \n\nDon\u2019t make an impulsive decision! I promise you all you\u2019ll be doing is getting rid of things you love during a difficult time, which is never a good idea. The two are not connected. Wanting \u201cclean\u201d makeup is perfectly fine, but your reasoning is based in anxiety and I think you\u2019ll really regret it.",

Many of those products have inferior preservatives and actually grow bacteria faster. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this awful health issue. It can feel like \"why not, what's the harm in trying everything?\" when you're going through something intense, but I assure you, stressing about needless \"harmful things\" is far worse for your health than products tested for safety.\n\nI'm wishing you all the best.",

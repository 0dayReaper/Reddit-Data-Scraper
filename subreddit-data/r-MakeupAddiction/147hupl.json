    "postText": "I recently restocked on the same shade I\u2019ve been using for years, and my new bottle is extremely yellow. I asked around, turns out quite a few people are having an issue with their new bottles being darker. \n\nSephora employees informed me that the reason why the concealer was previously out of stock is because Too Faced had to pull the concealer off shelves to reformulate, due to an issue in the ingredients. Apparently Shoppers Drug Mart still has the old formula. None of this is confirmed. \n\nHas anybody else experienced this with their new bottles of the super coverage concealer? Or have insider info? Nobody is talking about this and it\u2019s frustrating!",

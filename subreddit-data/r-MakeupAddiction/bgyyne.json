I think your makeup is really good.\n\nThere is one thing that can improve it if you want to go from good to wow.  You lost the color saturation and color vibrancy in your hair and eyebrows in the before and after.  Do you have different lighting?  If not, sometimes unflattering colors can have this same effect (for me it's deep shades that suck the color out of my fair complexion, while the right shades make me almost radiant/glowing).\n\nI suspect that the black top and liner draws color out of your face and makes you appear more pale.  Black doesn't flatter many people to be fair.   I would love to see a fresh pink lip on you, or something to bring color back in.  Your before picture appears more fresh and vibrant.  When I wear black and I'm not going for a rock/goth look, I'll add a flattering lip shade, pop a flattering scarf/headband or something around my face.\n\nI suspect the Youtuber Zabrena is of similar coloring to you and she usually does a great job at enhancing her natural coloring...  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj1wT\\_VZXbQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj1wT_VZXbQ) \n\nThis is just as suggestion... Your makeup technique is very good as it is.  I tend to be very experimental with makeup and love to wear looks that my coworkers sometime tell me that I \"look tired\"... I love a blue smoky eye, but it does nothing for me. LOL  So, it's totally understandable if you want to wear shades that aren't as flattering! I do this knowingly all the time...",

It gives me a great natural looking coverage.",

Tapping foundation and concealer into my skin is a game changer too. I think following up with a slightly damp beauty blender give a natural finish without affecting the coverage too much",

I find it covers a ton and stays put all day. I have rosacea and my skin is always having little break outs on and off, so I specifically use it for coverage. I did have to get used to it at first bc the first layer wasn\u2019t super full coverage like I pictured. \nI live in Florida and I feel like it\u2019s the only foundation that doesn\u2019t melt off",

But using a wet sponge will make getting full coverage more difficult because it will 1. absorb some of the product, and 2. thin it out. If you want that full coverage wow kinda result then a brush with a flat top or one that you can use to paint on the foundation.",

And don't stay away from the sponge! It's still a great tool for making sure you get a nice blended result and don't look too cakey. I like to apply+blend out my foundation with a brush and then go over my whole face with a damp sponge to make sure everything is seamless and to pick up any excess product.",

I\u2019m pretty chill about most things, but two things I will never use are 1) no-name brand Halloween face paint from China (sold at Michael\u2019s, Party City, etc), because it\u2019s been found to contain lead, nickel and other cancer-causing heavy metals which absorb through the skin, and 2) non eye-safe, no-name glitter. China\u2019s product safety regulations are a joke. \n\nOne more for parents: I don\u2019t let my kids eat no-name-brand candy made in China, which you find a lot around holidays in novelty packaging (e.g. a big plastic candy cane filled with chocolate balls and a musical toy with lights on one end).",

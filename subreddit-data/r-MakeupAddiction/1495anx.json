    "postText": "I am in my mid to late 20s now and am trying to lean more into colors and styles that flatter me (hair , makeup , clothes etc.). I have some confusion about my skin tone though. Right now I think I may be neutral but cool leaning . I really get confused by my veins. Sorry about the length but I am going to give as much info as possible without posting photos of myself as I'm not comfortable.\n\nFor a physical description: I am very fair , I am prone to freckles when I go in the sun on my face (I don't see that much because I live in the Northern hemisphere but had them when I was little and a teenager because I went outdoors).\n\nIf I go in salt water or am outside for (2 hours ish ) I will burn when its sunny out if I don't apply sunscreen . I do not tan very much if at all. Sometimes I  get a ''tint'' after a large or bad sunburn just in that area. Because of what I said above, when I take online tests I usually get that I am a ''cool'' skin tone , but here is where I get confused.\n\nMy veins appear to be purple or blue in certain areas (my wrists and cubital fossa area aka elbow armpit) and turquoise aka greenish/blueish on my arms and hands. The veins on my eyelids appear purple. I am unsure of my ethnic heritage like many North Americans but the maiden name/last names of all my grandparents (according to google) have ties to French , German , Norse , English and Irish heritage. The majority of my family has very fair to light skin (immediate and distant) , half(ish) can tan half cannot. My mom believes that my dad could have some indigenous heritage or I believe maybe even Iberian/Italian heritage as his brother and him both have very dark hair , medium to deep eyes and can tan very deeply . My brother and mom get light to medium tans in the summer .\n\nWhen I was little my hair was very light brown to maybe a neutral dirty blonde color. My hair in junior high and highschool was a light neutral brown which in adulthood has faded to a neutral to cool light to medium brown which I have started dying sense it flatters me less. I also used to swim competitively so I am unsure if my hair was ever effected by the natural lightening that chlorine can do sometimes or if its just gotten darker with age. I have been told by pretty much everyone that I looked better as a blonde (my current hair color) so much so that people have began to insult my natural color whenever I decide to go dark (lol).\n\nI have found that most times when I dye my hair brown it's too warm pretty well every time (even when I say I don't want that) and appears wig like or washes me out. I have never gone dark brown or black , I have also not been white or platinum blonde (not without a lack of trying). When my blonde is too golden or warm I think it can look cheap or unflattering on me as well and at times where it's a little too ashy (thanks too a very effective purple shampoo) I can look washed out as well. I do find that when I use silver shampoo as oppose to purple and it leans a little cooler I feel the prettiest. I also had my blonde kind of a neutral medium to light blonde in the past (a fair bit of warmth to it) and I felt very pretty with that as well. My eyelashes are a very light brown naturally and I'm prone to scarring on my skin but not near as prone to things like hyperpigmentation like my ex with a medium to deep warm skin tone.\n\nI don't wear jewelry hardly ever (like in years) but my old nose ring and earrings were usually grey or silver but I believe a light or pale gold may be pretty on me. The only colors I really hate on me are white or cream and maybe a really nude beige  maybe a mustard yellow. I do not go for very vibrant colors normally (except for maybe blues) and find myself leaning to colors like royal blue , light/bright blue , navy blue (pretty well every blue) dark forest green and sometimes black . Grey can be good sometimes but sometimes it washes me out.\n\nMy natural eye color is a medium blue and I get flushed very easily. Most eyeshadow and lip colors look really bad on me. I tend to stick with shadows close to my skin tone or a white (if not too bold). I like most blushes on me usually a neutral to even a warm pink or a neutral to cool wine color is even nice at times. Really ashy or light lip colors make me look like I've been dead for a few days , or really bold cool colors like purple or reds do the same. The only red lip I've liked on me was a warm to neutral red made by cover girl suited for fair skin (says them)or my Nivea tinted lip balm in strawberry if I have some bronzer on. I overall believe pinks of any shade are the safest bet for me  although there's no telling if one is going to wash me out. Bronzers are fairly forgiving as long as I don't go to crazy. I find it difficult to find a foundation that matches my skin perfectly. I usually go for ''fair neutral or fair cool'' shades but I'm really still guessing. Sometimes I mix or fix with blushes or bronzers.\n\nSo ya I'm sorry if any of this info was overkill or irrelevant. I have seen a lot of contradictive stuff and am confused on what's really relevant. If possible I would like to find a darker hair color that suits me and is less maintenance then blonde and healthier for my hair. I just find its the safest bet as no color turns out exactly how you think it should most times. I believe I look acceptable with a greater array of blondes' then I do browns. I also want to be able to more easily pick out lipsticks and/or shades of foundation colors if I am unable to try them out.\n\nThanks so much for anyone who took the time to read this and sorry again if it's too long , irrelevant , has spelling errors etc.",

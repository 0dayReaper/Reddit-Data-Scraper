    "postText": "My skin is up and down. Right now, it's been great and looks super hydrated prior to applying makeup. I use the ELF putty primer and then the NARS tinted radiant moisturizer then set with the Laura Mercier Powder then spray with setting spray when done. \n\nI get dry on my forehead and chin and it looks flaky and makes me feel super self conscious. I have tried to swap out primers and foundations and rotated between a moist beauty blender and a brush, but still having issues and left feeling flaky and unconfident when I put my makeup on. Any tips here? I have to go to work in person 3 days a week and I feel so self conscious ppl are looking at my dry skin :(",

Get the Kate Sommerville goats milk cleanser, Chanel\u2019s hydrating micro serum and Sonia Roselli\u2019s Waterbalm in your like and wear an spf 50 daily. Your results will be life changing. And exfoliate on dry skin with Peter Thomas Roth firm X peeling gel, it rolls the dead skin off of your face and gives you immediate results.",

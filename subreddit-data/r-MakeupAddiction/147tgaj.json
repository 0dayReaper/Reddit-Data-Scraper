Like you, I have gone from warm to olive to neutral to COOL.  lol. I have south Asian skin tone, Fitzpatrick IV so I never expected to be a cool but it\u2019s my favorite match on me so far. \n\nThe real answer is that it\u2019s going to depend on the foundation. Each brands formulation is ever so slightly different so the best thing to do is choose a couple of brands you like and get some samples to see how they look on you. I like Nordstroms beauty counters because they have multiple brand counters and aren\u2019t afraid of giving samples. Then I do a full face and check out my reflection in different light settings. It\u2019s the long winded way, but it paid off for me.",

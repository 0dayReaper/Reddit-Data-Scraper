I am also new to using makeup as well.\ud83d\udc84 I have a small, somewhat raised white scar on my face. It is located in between my nose and lips. Unfortunately I fell face first a few years back. \u2639\ufe0f Anyway, I was hoping to get some suggestions on how to cover my scar up with some makeup. Please let me know any methods and products that I should use. Thanks so much! \ud83d\ude4f\n\nEDIT: I posted a photo of the scar in the comments. \u2764\ufe0f",

Sorry this isn't directly relevant but if you want to try to reduce the scar you may want to check out the skincare subs for advice there as well. r/SkincareAddiction if/when it becomes public again. r/SkincareAddicts\n\nI've actually used Mederma on facial scars and had a lot of success, I've more recently started using tretinoin which you can get an Rx for online. Of course, what works for me may not work for you so do research and patch tests. \n\nHope this comment doesn't break rules, I looked at the rules but if I missed something I'll delete. Sorry again that this isn't makeup advice but just wanted to share. \ud83d\ude42",

Good luck!",

I have no idea what you meant about it being taunt and relaxed. So you think the primer will make it look less raised? Do you know anything that will help with the shinyness by any chance?",

Powder will remove shine, which will make shadows and highlights much more diffuse and give a flatter appearance to your skin\n\nIf you are new to makeup and don't want to wear much, I'd advice to go for a stick concealer for starters. Just dab it on and blend with your fingers. It should have a more matte finish while being more forgiving than a liquid concealer\n\nIf it was for me, as I wear a BB cream most days with some powder, I'd go for a dab of liquid concealer and light powder",

The only makeup that I wear sometimes is mainly eye stuff like eye liner, mascara and eye shadow. That\u2019s only sometimes though. Oh and concealer too for my under eyes and the scar. But I feel like the concealer doesn\u2019t cover the scar much. Anytime I feel like I have good coverage, I feel like it goes away like a minute later. Any advice on that? Also yes the scar is a bit shiny. Any product recommendations to help with that? And any concealer recommendations? Sorry for all the questions, you just seem helpful! \ud83d\ude03",

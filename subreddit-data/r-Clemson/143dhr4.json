    "postText": "Hey guys, I am an ECE major and realized I need to take ECE 3300, ECE 3800, and ECE 3200 next summer (due to a co-op). If I don't take all of these classes during the summer I will graduate a year late. All three classes are only offered during the first summer. Is this doable or should I go ahead and accept that I will need to graduate a year late?",

I had EMAG last semester with Raza, and it wasn't too bad, I've heard Signals is a nightmare though, and almost certainly the hardest class of ECE. Not too sure about Electronics, but I imagine it's of similar-ish difficulty to Circuits II. \n\nSo basically, do you think you can take all 3 classes at the same time, in about 40% of the time you would normally take them?\n\nIf you're okay with spending your entire days doing nothing but those 3 classes, and you're already fairly skilled at the content, then you'll probably be okay, but it's going to be a ton of work. \n\nThe much safer option is to take only one or two of them during the first summer, and either take extra classes when you get back to school after your co-op, or just accept that you'll be graduating a semester late.",

I apologize for assuming wrongly. \n\nSecond, many of Clemson\u2019s students have continuously displayed a terrible track record of following the best safety measures. There\u2019s been numerous parties, open defiance of the mask ordinance, and overall lack of care for the community as a whole. No, I\u2019m not wasting hours of my day being a \u201csocial justice warrior.\u201d I rarely comment on anything. This may not be the best method of getting their attention to stop being so immature. However, it\u2019s a small way to do so. \n\nPosting on social media may encourage some to follow proper measures. If some family and friends see them in this, some may insist that these students actually do their part. There are times where it can go too far, but there\u2019s not much else that can be done. I DO NOT condone having strangers harass individuals on their private social media accounts (by private messaging or sending threats). However, a general call-out post like this may get some to realize that their actions are not helping the community.",

The way I see it is that Clemson as a university has way too many students on campus and those students will lead to excess congestion at every venue whether it's on campus or off so maybe more students should be made to do online classes and only allow one student per room rather than add to the perceived problem. Dont you think it's a tad irresponsible of Clemson to allow an influx of students and risk the livelihoods and health of the people that are permanent residents of the town of Clemson and the surrounding areas?",

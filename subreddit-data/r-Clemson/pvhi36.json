We could only do that with guys like Amari, Artavis Scott, etc.  \n  \nThe one thing no one I see is talking about, is how the receivers have regressed without Jeff Scott. Our routes are shitty, guys like Ross are dropping easy passes, and we don\u2019t have a good short yardage Renfrow type that can help us move the sticks either. Ladson and Ngata are fucking useless when they\u2019re not injured.  \n  \nWhat happened to EJ Williams? Why aren\u2019t we trying stuff with Dacari Collins? But nah, let\u2019s let another coach\u2019s kid or well-connected alumni\u2019s kid walk on and take up space",

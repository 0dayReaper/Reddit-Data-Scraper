    "postText": "Making this post because the lease application for next year opens really soon so wanted to give a PSA that this is not the place to live. I live here now and we have had a lot of problems. As I am writing this, the fire alarm is going off for the third time in 24 hours lol. I know a lot of people will sign a lease thinking that the problems will resolve themselves by next year, but the group that owns the complex will not change. They have done a lot of crappy stuff and are known for cutting corners with their apartment complexes. My roommates and I figured this out too late, so please don't make our mistake! If you want more information, someone made an instagram account called @ fudockside.",

Over priced, no discounts for the lack of amenities, apartment is cheaply made &amp; furnished, and now roaches have made their way in from the garbage left in the hallways. She saw someone else already had to have an exterminator come in.\n\nLol just followed the insta - worth it",

All the construction going on disturbs things. Given it\u2019s proximity to the lack &amp; restaurants I\u2019m surprised there aren\u2019t rats. \n\nIn addition to the ongoing issues, the walls are thin-if you\u2019re trying to study or sleep and your roommates are up it\u2019s a pain in the ass.",

Also, it depends on when you sign the contract bc as time goes on and they get more desperate, rates lower. Next year though I heard rates are going up over $100 more per month",

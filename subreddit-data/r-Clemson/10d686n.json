    "postText": "So nobody has ever actually told me anything about what I need to be doing as I prepare to graduate next December job-wise. I know there\u2019s a job fair coming up this month but I don\u2019t know if now is the right time for me to be attending, and if so what I should do to prepare. I also don\u2019t know who to contact at Clemson to ask for departmental advice on securing a summer internship/job and a postgrad job. Like I\u2019m completely green with all this and I\u2019m unbelievably lost. Can anyone give me some tips and advice on what I should be doing?",

I\u2019m in banking and we had an intern work with us during the summer, went back to Clemson for his last semester and graduated in December. He was hired full time in January. \n\nJob fairs are great to get an idea of what you\u2019d want to do if nothing else. You\u2019d also be surprised to find out about internship opportunities.",

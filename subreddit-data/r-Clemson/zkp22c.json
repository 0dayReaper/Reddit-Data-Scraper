    "postText": "So I am currently living in a single in Douthit East because of accommodations (I have them for a private bedroom and semi-private bathroom) and I'm thinking about changing rooms because it's a bit pricey. I know the highrises have single interior rooms, and I can hopefully try and work through the bathroom situation. Because of the whole problem of me needing a private bedroom, I'm curious as to what requesting to change rooms is like. Would I be able to request a single interior room specifically, and would I be bound to switching anyway if there are none available? Thanks for any help y'all can provide!",

There is a textbox to enter some details in the reason for why and you could include the specifics of an interior room. They will do their best to find you a room that finds your accommodations as they are required to meet them. You could also reach out to the clemson home email and ask to speak to the assignments coordinator about your specific needs and they would be happy to help as best as possible.",

You won\u2019t be able to move until the end of the semester/beginning of next, probably. If your housing is paid through the year, ask about the price difference or refund policy. It\u2019s also possible that it\u2019s more expensive to have a single. I\u2019d be wary of those interior rooms without windows. I lived in one with a roommate for a semester and although it was nice to have a sink, I hated not having a window.",

The high rises are either at capacity or will be when spring semester transfer students move in, and interior rooms are not default singles, most actually have 2 people in them right now but since you have that accommodation any room should be able to be a single for you",

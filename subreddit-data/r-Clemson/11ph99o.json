Other big pros are that the campus is beautiful, the STEM programs are top tier, there's a lot of clubs around to make friends at, a lot of dining options, and my experience with the faculty has been generally very good.\n\nA con is off campus housing can be very rough. Also, the parking situation is really bad.\n\nI'm biased but I would personally say that the pros greatly outweigh the cons.",

I never went to CU for school, (employee here) but at least area-wise I prefer St. Pete over Clemson. I\u2019ve met several CU students and they seem to like their education they\u2019ve received here, but same is to be said for USF. Clemson is nice location wise just because you have access to traveling to other states (close to GA, not too crazy far from NC/TN) vs Florida where you really only have GA and that\u2019s a much longer drive. \n\nMore importantly would be the cost of the program you\u2019re looking into though (in state tuition for either programs?/in state scholarships like Bright Futures in FL?). I guess another point to mention is that St. Pete is pretty pricey in terms of cost of living. Clemson seems to be cheaper for housing by a lot, especially if you decide to live in the surrounding cities",

I have no connections to the place and have never visited, but I\u2019ve only ever heard terrible things and I constantly see advertisements for it on social media and around Clemson. Seems pretty scummy to be concerned about sucking in future tenants when you can\u2019t even give your current tenants a safe, functioning place to live.",

They almost should have to give 1/4 of your rent back for not delivering on a large incentive of staying at Epoch. Other Clemson housing has pools for as much as 100-400 less a month. I never even heard if they got the lakeside part done.",

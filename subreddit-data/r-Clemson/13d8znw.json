The incoming class data goes into the national rankings/entrance stats so it's important to keep those high in order to keep up the rankings in the eyes of the college world. \n\nTransfers don't go into the calculations to my knowledge.",

I believe my ACT score from back in high school was around a 25. I got accepted in as an engineering major, which at Clemson is pretty competitive. So, if you are around those numbers you should be fine. You can probably get in as a transfer with even lower stats because in talking to my roommates, their gpa\u2019s were just above a 3.0 and had near similar testing scores and got in as well. So, don\u2019t psych yourself out",

My SAT score was excellent, though ancient. My acceptance was contingent; they wanted me to finish my second semester at community and submit those grades before I would hear back. I got accepted ten days before the spring semester started into psych. I was told that the public health major is more difficult to get into and that they only accept new students for it in the fall, and that students trying to change their major into it get priority. If you aren't accepted into public health, you could always try to change into it. If, by chance, you are trying for medical school, I was told that psych is excellent because, along with a bio or life sciences cluster minor, you get all the requirements without such a difficult course load, and it allows you to really study the brain.",

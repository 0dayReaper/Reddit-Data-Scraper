I personally did and I only had one class in lehotsky. \n\nThere\u2019s an LLC for AVS students called WAVS but it\u2019s for women in AVS. You can do RISE which is residents in science and engineering. It\u2019ll mostly be engineering students in there but you\u2019ll have a lot of common first year classes like chem, bio, Calc, etc. so that\u2019s an option. I lived in the honors LLC and I was like the only CAFLS kid in it lol, but I really enjoyed my time. \n\nI would personally just find a dorm you like online and stick with it.",

RISE wasn't an option for my major, maybe it was for you idk. I lived in a shoebox, and while it was a walk, it was not that bad. You will get used to whatever walking you need to do pretty quickly.",

Depending on your major though it may not be necessary to be close as another comment points out. \n\nThere\u2019s unfortunately not a cafls LLC but honestly in ag sciences people get along well and kind of all hang out in the same buildings/areas because there are so many classes and teachers in common",

That being said, you're going to have quite a few gen-eds for your first couple semesters, so classes can be all over the place.",

            "comment": "Ive been here 7 years (4 undergrad, 3 graduate). Some of my closest friends and great memories have been here. I haven\u2019t regretted coming here at all \n\nPros: good school, plenty of resources to help you academically. Culture is great. People in clemson LOVE clemson. This makes football season amazing. Even if you dont like/dont care about sports its a great avenue to meet people have a good time. the school is growing fast. The campus has changed a lot of my tenor but I can only imagine it will improve by the time you would graduate. Greenville isnt far from clemson (hour drive) lots to do there, fun city. \n\nCons: the city in general is a bit spread out, this isnt a problem as a freshman because youll be on campus but when you move to an apartment youll be driving to class every day and that can be annoying (a lot of schools have this problem though). Other than Greenville a lot of stuff can be out of the way. Because we arnt in the city you might feel like you\u2019ve done everything in a year or so. \n\nFrom my understanding of friends who were pre med or are in med school now clemson does a good job at preparing you. A lot of people end up at MUSC (Columbia or Charleston) which is a good school, as well as many other places across the country.",

Lots of classes have \u201ccommon exams\u201d now, like orgo. So if you can\u2019t get in the class with the best professor or the one who writes most of the exam, you\u2019re gonna have a lot harder of a time getting an A. For example, one of the organic chem professors had close to a 40% A rate (it wasn\u2019t an honors section), while mine had an 18% A rate. One of our professors told us that they plan on separating labs from lecture grades in intro classes because there were \u201ctoo many As.\u201d \n\nSo as a premed, I do wish I went to a different undergrad. But I\u2019m in state, so the tuition is really cheap for me\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAdditionally, lots of public in state med schools like to take a certain amount of people who went to their undergrad (if they have one).

We obviously have great things to say about the school.\n\nBut as a resident of GA who will be forced to pay OOS tuition, I'd suggest you think long and hard about going to Clemson - especially if it is going to require that you take out loans to pay for it.  Only you can decide if Clemson is the best choice but as others have mentioned, it's not probably not worth the added expense over a cheaper in-state option in GA.  It sucks that money might be the deciding factor, but there is nothing about the \"Clemson experience\" that is worth going into debt over vs an in-state option that is going to be very similar and cost much less money.",

Most departments are run well, which correlates to high-quality classes (some aren't, and it is pretty easy to see which ones are those).\n\nCons: Parking is horrendous. Good luck finding anywhere to park on Sunday after a day out or when heading to classes each day (if you live off campus). Oh, and if you park in certain areas, you must move your vehicle after certain times/days (especially for football games). Speaking of gameday, all but one dining hall is closed, so have fun trying to find a cheap spot to eat. The library also has weird hours on certain days, so I would be aware of them, especially when you need to study for an exam and print stuff out. Also, the OOS tuition is high (as compared to in-state), so I would be weary of that when deciding which college to attend (if money could be a contention point for you). Certain departments are run horribly, and certain classes within those departments are notoriously bad, so I would avoid them as much as you can. Also, Clemson is in the middle of nowhere, so you might need to drive a bit to do stuff. I guess this gives it a small college-town feel, but you could go either way on whether you like that.",

    "postText": "Hey all. I'm obviously using a throwaway account for this post because I have no idea what information is or isn't allowed to be public, and I want to be safe just in case. Anyway, there are understandably a lot of questions out there, and so I wanted to at least provide everyone with what I have been told, whether this information be from my department, colleagues, or upper administration. Some of this information may be different for other departments -- I have no idea, which, honestly, is a very common phrase right now, but I'll indicate that which is particular to my department as needed. Finally, **this stuff can change at any moment.** Just like our \"phase\" plan was axed, some of this could be very different by the time August, or even the end of the week, rolls around. At any rate, here's what I know:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* All courses must be able to offer an entirely online way to complete them. This has been mentioned here several times, but just to reiterate it in case someone may have missed it, I'm mentioning it again. If a student is immunocompromised, for example, then they can choose to take their courses online right from the start of the semester, and all faculty are expected to offer courses that can be taken by both those students (online/distanced) and those who will be appearing in-person. Obviously, labs make this problematic; I have not heard any information about how that stuff will be handled. Students should contact their advisors about questions regarding this. **Edit:** It is extremely unlikely that advisors can address this issue right now. I do not know of any procedures or guidelines that have been outlined on how these requests will be handled.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* In addition to the above, faculty may need to switch their course entirely online at any point, which they will be allowed to do. For example, if a faculty member's child's school closes down but Clemson does not, they may need to stay home rather than going to campus. In other words, the university as a whole does not need to go online in order for a course to become an online course.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* All classrooms will be at 1/3 capacity. Students will also be expected to sit 6 feet from each other in classrooms. This has also been publicly stated a few times. So, a classroom that would normally have been able to hold 40 people will be able to hold 13 (12 students + 1 faculty). The university is going to be utilizing a lot of unconventional spaces as classrooms in order to attempt to offset this. For example, athletic facilities, the Madrin Center, and other more administrative spaces could be used as classrooms. No one knows for sure, though.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* As the President said in an email sent out to everyone, faculty and students will be provided with masks, as they are required for all students, faculty, and staff. These masks are available for  faculty now (at least they are in my department).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* The university is aiming to have 75% of classes offer some kind of face-to-face education. This will be determined by the section, not by the number of students. For example, a course section that has 10 students in it that offers face-to-face interaction will be weighed the same as another course with 100 students in it. If that 100-student course is online, then that simply counts a single section being online, not 100 students now being online. This is a bit confusing, so I hope this makes some sense. Whether or not they will meet their 75% goal remains to be seen.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* Student enrollment numbers are currently above normal levels. In fact, the university is looking to increase the total number of students if they can, and so far they are by several hundred students. As far as I can see with my classes, this means that class caps will be higher than normal (mine are already 4-5 students above last fall, with more enrollments expected). If I were to make a comment on this, it would be that faculty will therefore have more to worry about student-wise than they may have before, adding another layer of stress to our jobs. Of course, this can and likely will vary by department, and at the end of the day the university desperately needs money.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* The university expects to lose between $50 and $150 million this year. This was discussed at the Faculty Senate meeting on 7/14.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* Clemson employees can expect to be furloughed in some way this semester, though the plan is to not furlough those who make the least amount of money unless absolutely necessary. My understanding of this is that, for staff, this means less hours worked equating to less pay. For faculty, this simply means a pay cut. I have been told that this is how furloughs worked back around 2008, which was when they last happened.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* The administration has been extremely unhelpful overall in guiding how to handle faculty/staff/student flow in our buildings. This may be different for other departments/colleges, of course. What I mean by this is determining how walking patterns and directions will work, how elevator capacity will work (if there are elevators), where and what signage will be in our buildings, bathroom occupancy, etc.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* The flexibility that faculty have in meeting the requirements for a \"hybrid\" course is fairly substantial. This can be a good or a bad thing, depending on how you want to look at it. On one hand, a faculty member can choose to engage students synchronously, with classroom meetings in-person for a portion of the overall course population on each meeting day (1/2 the class on Tuesday, 1/2 the class on Thursday, for instance), and that's hybrid. On the other hand, a faculty member can post recorded videos/PowerPoints, making the course primarily asynchronous/online, and offer optional in-person meetings for those students who want to meet, and that is equally hybrid.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* Some faculty may opt to offer to have their classes meet outside. This may vary by department.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* COVID-19 testing that is required of faculty and students prior to the semester beginning is to be completed by Clemson University. ~~This means that a student who lives in Atlanta cannot take a COVID-19 test in Atlanta three days before coming to campus and have that test count towards their admittance to campus.~~ ~~No one knows how/where these tests will all be conducted right now~~, though testing stations in nearby towns (Seneca, Anderson, etc.) is possible. **Edit:** Several have pointed out that the logistics of this idea don't seem to make sense. I agree. Again, remember that any of this information could change at any time, and that unless a statement from the administration is made, this is not technically official. **Edit again:** Clemson *will* accept test results from other sources. This was clarified during the town hall meeting on 7/17. The initial testing site for employees and student employees is New Spring megachurch starting 7/20. No other information was given as to where/how to submit external results.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* All faculty and students will be required to complete a \"self-analysis\" test before coming to campus every day that they are expected on campus. If any of the test's aspects (?) are failed, then that person cannot come to campus that day. ~~No other information about this is known right now.~~ **Edit:** It looks like [this](https://cvd19-self-assessment.app.clemson.edu/) will likely be the test we are required to take. Seems simple enough to me (thanks /u/Swimming_Elk for the info).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* No faculty member can have an attendance policy that penalizes a student in any way. This means that while a faculty member can take attendance for record-keeping purposes, that's all it can be used for. If I can comment on this, I would say that this is a fairly big deal, as now students do not have any responsibility to attend classes or communicate an absence tied to their grades. At the same time, this policy change is understandable, as a student may fail their \"self analysis,\" which would not include a doctor's note but still must be taken seriously. Personally, I was planning on taking attendance only for students who would be required to be in the room in-person, and I would accept virtually any plausible excuse for an absence, meaning the only students that would be \u201cpenalized\u201d in my classes would be those who have zero communication.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* One of the primary reasons why Clemson was resistant to switching to entirely online courses was due to the situation regarding ICE and international students (in a nutshell, if a college moved online, international students would have been forced to leave the country). This is no longer an issue as of 7/14 (thankfully), so, things may change now.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* Faculty in my department can now access their offices (key card access works). I assume this means other departments can, too. I only mention this because no one really knows what the new \u201cholistic\u201d approach to reopening means, so, this is where faculty are at.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* Facilities is looking into the possibility of allowing windows in classrooms to be opened (if they can be opened at all). Many of the older buildings/offices used to have openable windows, but they were sealed long ago. These windows may be allowed to be opened for better airflow, though the discussions are still ongoing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* Faculty classroom assignments are being handled primarily by the university at large rather than individual departments, which means that most, if not all, faculty that teach courses back-to-back all day (like me; I teach four classes) will not be in a single classroom (or two) all day. This new piece of information seriously concerns me regarding my health and exposure to COVID-19, as I and most other faculty will be constantly moving around/across campus, putting ourselves out into the masses (who are all expected to practice social distancing, of course) when we normally would stay in the same room all day. Getting re-acclimated to another classroom is somewhat annoying normally, but with the hybrid nature of classes requiring more technological know-how and setup, the new and likely longer-taking walking patterns in buildings and on campus, the need to sanitize classrooms between each class meeting, and the possibility of our classrooms being in very different locations throughout the day, it seems, in my opinion, very irresponsible/negligent to make the oldest members of Clemson (the faculty) constantly expose themselves to the larger campus several times every day that they are on campus. I can see this pushing faculty that would otherwise have been hesitantly okay with the hybrid structure to move their courses online, but that is simply my opinion. I know that if I am scrambling across campus four times a day, I will be moving online.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* Building off of the above, there might be adjustments to the amount of time between classes, but such adjustments would have a large impact on class meeting time length or the number of classes that can physically be offered on any given day. As of right now the same 15-minute window we\u2019ve always had is in place and there is no discussion between administration and faculty/students regarding this issue.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* There is a hiring freeze for all departments; no one new can be hired unless there is a very specific reason or circumstance to do so.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* Most, if not all, 1000-level courses in my department that are taught by graduate students have been moved online. My understanding is that most other departments are doing this, too, but I do not know for sure.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* We have no idea how the public transportation (CAT Bus) system will work. There is a good chunk of faculty that rely on that system to get to and from campus just as much as students do, and we have not been given any information about stop schedules, limited capacity, etc.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* Faculty are being strongly encouraged (but not required) to offer their office hours online in order to limit their amount of time on campus, so students should expect to be meeting with professors virtually even if the course is hybrid. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* No one knows anything about sports.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThat's all I can think of right now. I hope this long list of information helps. This Friday, 7/17, the Provost and Executive VP of Finance and Operations will be hosting a \u201cvirtual town hall\u201d meeting for one hour, so more information will likely come out of that, as they are asking faculty and staff to submit questions now in preparation for that meeting. For all of you students, know that faculty are just as worried, frustrated, scared, etc., etc. as you are. I am going to do my absolute best to be understanding and accommodating this semester, believe me, but everyone *needs* to be more human and understanding now than ever before.\n\nStay safe out there.\n\nEdit: I've been answering as many follow-up questions in the comments as I can, so check down there, too.\n\nEdit 2: I know it may seem redundant (thanks for the thanks), but thank you all for your kindness and appreciation (and the gold!). I care so very much about all of you and simply want to help.\n\nEdit 3: Added some updated info to a few of the above and clarified some points.\n\nEdit 4: And thanks for the silver, too! While I'm here: Just remember, much of this information has not come from an official administrative announcement, which means that much of this is not quite set in stone. And, once again, as we have seen, even things set in stone are not as set as we may think they are.\n\nEdit 5: Updated information regarding testing sites and external test results.",

I answered this question in a thread above:\n&gt; My understanding is that you would be able to switch back and forth as needed. For example, if a student is exposed to COVID-19, they would need to go online while they are quarantined and cleared of the virus for 10-14 days before then being allowed back. I'm fairly certain that any student can request this at any time for any reasonable reason.\n\nSo, yes, you would be able to immediately switch online and, ideally, get an equal education. For me, all of my synchronous discussions will be broadcast online from the classroom and they'll be recorded for later viewing if needed. If I go all-online, I'll be able to have the same format entirely, too. How prepared other professors will be (particularly the very old/non-digital ones), I don't know.\n\nEdit: words",

Although my advisor placed a request to the department to provide me access to my lab, I have been unable to get access for these couple of months. My dissertation work has taken a severe hit and I am totally confused on what to do. What's completely astounding is that a bunch of grad students were permitted lab access after spring break and so far they have been able to carry on with their work on campus without issue. In the last town hall meeting hosted by our department, we were told that grad students who still haven't received access will have to patiently wait until Phase 2 reopening guidelines are announced.",

I don't know the answer, though, as I have not heard anything specific regarding lab access. My department does not have many courses that utilize lab space, so that is probably why I have not heard much. I would continue to email people in your department explaining your situation. I cannot imagine that they would dig their heels in considering your situation.\n\nI know that campus access is going to limited until employees are tested, which starts next week (if it hasn't already). This was the one piece of information I was able to get from today's Town Hall meeting before it continuously crashed to the point of them stopping the broadcast. Clemson has partnered with MUSC and will have a testing site at the New Spring megachurch next week. Anyone who wants to go to campus will need to be tested there before going to campus. *Maybe* you'll need to do that for lab access, and so that might clear things up for you. But I have no idea. Granting someone access should not be an arduous process.",

Thank you for all this helpful information, it seems as an incoming student all we\u2019ve really been time for the last two months is \u201cwe\u2019ll tell you at a later date\u201d. Clemson has also been terrible at communicating when certain appointments and things open, like registering for a move in date. The websites where these huge decisions are made also crash multiple times when trying to sign up. Overall pretty disappointed in the university\u2019s response to be honest.",

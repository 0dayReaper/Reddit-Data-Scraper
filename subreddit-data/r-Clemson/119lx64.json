The problem is that when you park at Zaxby's, you can't pull out of the space because of the line of cars waiting to get to the place where you order.  You have to kind of go around the building twice by car to do the entire order/pick up your food process so the line is two cars wide.  There's no room to pull out.\n\nBut, as I sat waiting in line yesterday, I figured it out.  If you want to do the walk-up ordering, park in either the CFA or Taco Bell lot and walk over.  CFA is, of course, closed on Sundays, so it's not a problem.  But, I think that CFA and Taco Bell will get tired of people doing this sooner rather than later.\n\nI also could see that Cook Out, who would normally have the two lines backed up almost to the highway, had zero cars in either line.",

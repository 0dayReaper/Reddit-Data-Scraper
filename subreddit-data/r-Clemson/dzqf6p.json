We had Clemson fans buying us beer, teaching us about your football history, and checking to make sure we were having a good time. Despite the final score, we had an absolute blast. Thank you for everything (and sorry that we couldn\u2019t stay ranked before the matchup)!\n\nP.S. you already know this, but Death Valley is an incredible stadium",

I have always had great experiences in Winston-Salem (other than the frigid cold three years ago and the Thursday night loss in 2008, but that gave us Dabo, so...thanks). Plus y\u2019all have Krispy Kreme and beer in the stadium, which is awesome.",

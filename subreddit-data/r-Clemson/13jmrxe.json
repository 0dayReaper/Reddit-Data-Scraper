Even though the bulk of the pond gets drained, there must be some lower alcove in the drainage system where the fish go until the pond is refilled.\n\n2. They have the fish caught, hold them in tanks/aquariums, and then put back in after cleaning.\n\n3. They get new fish every time they clean the pond.",

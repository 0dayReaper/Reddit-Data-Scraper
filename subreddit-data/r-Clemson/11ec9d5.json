    "postText": "Hi - I'm trying to assist my freshman daughter in storing some items during the Summer when she returns home to New England. First option I heard of seems to be white-glove service and very high priced. There seem to potentially be more reasonable options like renting or sharing a storage unit. Does anyone have any advice or recommendations? \n\nthank you",

Prices on their website seem reasonable depending on what she needs ($50/ month for basic unit, $72 /month if you want ground floor and roll up door). Idk if rates go up for summer but it may be worthwhile to give them a call.",

When I first researched storage solutions in the area, Greenleaf was the only place with temperature/humidity controlled units, which was a dealbreaker for me in the summers as I store electronics, instruments, and vinyl records. Definitely on the pricier side (and they\u2019ve raised rates recently), but I\u2019ve been really satisfied with them.",

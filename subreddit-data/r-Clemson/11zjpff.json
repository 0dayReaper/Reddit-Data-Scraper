Every account will be deleted by next July.\n\nCurrent students will also be migrated over to Exchange as well, but that has a slightly longer timeline.",

I don't think it's been officially announced yet (other than the original announcement that it would end in October 2021, but they reached an agreement with Google to extend it) but I heard it straight from the CIO. They should be launching a big campaign to help people migrate any data pretty soon.",

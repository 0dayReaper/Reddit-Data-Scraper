I've graduated, I have a job that pays well, I own a smart phone, but I do not have such a phone plan (I generally use 1-2 gigs per month, why pay a ton extra for unlimited data I won't use?). If I were in college, without a well paying job or parents willing to pay for my cell phone plan, I would have an even more limited data plan than I have now; relying on the wifi that is available (provided there is power) most of the times I need to use data.\n\nAnd, just because you don't see the flip phones, doesn't mean they don't exist.",

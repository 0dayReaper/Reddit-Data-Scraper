    "postText": "\nThis is another post about how frustrating it is that nothing is open after 10 pm to study.\n\nI thought that the ASC was open till 2 am after seeing a post about it last week, but it turns out that those hours were only for midterm week. Tbh that\u2019s kind of stupid, since what\u2019s the point of only extending hours during exam week? People need to study BEFORE the exam\u2026 \n\nI\u2019m just so frustrated and annoyed that it\u2019s this hard to find a study spot that\u2019s open after 10. \n\nAnd yes, I have tried Vickery Hall. Actually just went right now and it was literally packed full.",

I get that the library flooded, but I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s stopping them from keeping any of the other buildings accessible after hours to those with a valid id. \n\nI\u2019ve tried getting into Kinnard or Martin after 10 and couldn\u2019t get in either. \n\nI also tried Brackett Hall and was told that while I could technically stay there after 10/11 pm, they would be turning off the lights and I wouldn\u2019t be able to get back in if I left. This was after the student worker went around telling everyone the building was closing soon. \n\nAnd on another note, it\u2019s also super irritating that they cut back the hours for the food places too lol. Like Panda Express and chick fil a close at 7 pm on weekdays and at 6 on Friday and Saturday. To me that\u2019s a super early dinner and I\u2019m always hungry late in the night when I\u2019m studying. \n\nIdk if after COVID they just don\u2019t have the funds anymore, or what, but it\u2019s kind of weird that everything closes so early.",

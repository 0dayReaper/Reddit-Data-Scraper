    "postText": "Clemson doesn't want you to drive your car. It's their vison that everyone live on campus, take a bus, or some other alternative method of transport. Instead of making the alternatives a better option to incentivize adaptation, they have chosen to make parking worse until people have no choice but to switch. The email sent out earlier this year makes their stance quite clear. They don't care that people spend nearly half an hour scouting a parking spot. They should have just used park and ride. Clemson's attitude towards their students in regard to transportation is hypocritical and detrimental to students.\n\nIf clearing cars from campus was so important to Clemson, then why are employee lots like E-1, E-9 and E-4 practically on campus? Why is Trustee Park, the heart of campus, surrounded by staff parking on the street? Why does staff get to continue the benefits of parking close? One can only speculate why Clemson's vision of a car free campus does not extend to the very people making the decision. Is this a situation where they want the car free goal but don't want to suffer the consequences of that? Is it that staff has more bargaining power with parking? Regardless its clear that as of now Clemson is only punishing the students to achieve their vision.\n\nThe vision to remove cars from campus is a bad one considering Clemson's location, but I can understand why Clemson wants to do it and there are ways to make it work. Clemson isn't in some dense urban city. Off campus student housing is sprawling across the area and very few are actually walking distance to campus. The most convenient option in this environment is to drive. Clemson claims there is always a spot to park in, but what good is that when you spend 30 minutes going lot to lot to find it? I find it highly insulting to be told to just use a park and ride lot. That's not the service I pay for, I pay for a commuter pass. Spaces in walking distance to campus, not a bus ride. After the thousands I pay in tuition, and the additional fee for parking, I expect to be able to park without issue in walking distance. Why does Clemson pretend that its in a city and can't add parking? It seems that leadership gives off this attitude that we should be grateful for the mere chance to find a commuter space. I want to see leadership looking to solve problems, and not act indignant at students when they present a problem that doesn't fit their vision. Students understand cars can be a problem, that they pose a threat to pedestrians, that they cause pollution. Unfortunately at the end of they day most people don't want to add an extra two hours to their commute to marginally cut down on car usage. I don't blame staff for parking near campus, if I worked at Clemson I'd want to park there too. I don't agree with the decision to limit cars near campus. I believe there are ways to make cars and campus coexist, that there are ways to make alternatives more desirable, and even some immediate solutions to parking problems.\n\nHere are some solutions:  \n\n\n1. Creating a parking app. Clemson could put counters at the entrances and exits of every lot that tally how many spaces are used. Transmit this to an app. Doing this would allow students to make informed decisions on where they are parking and decrease the amount of frustration that comes with nearly half an hour of hunting for a spot.  \n\n2. Resident lot relocation. Clemson has continually increased its student body and reduced commuter spaces, most recently C1 for resident spots. Clemson could instead create new further out lots that freshman have to park in, and turn the closer resident parking into commuter lots. Residents would be more likely to use a bus system from parking lots than commuters. \n3. Increasing lot capacity and adding more lots. Clemson could certainly squeeze out more parking from existing lots by doing some minor expansions to them, such as the back of C1. Additional parking lots could be added, like across from the Esso Club.\n4. The dreaded parking garages. As much as Clemson says they aren't, parking garages are possible. With an average cost per space of $30,000, a 2000 space garage would cost roughly 70 million to build. Clemson's operating budget was over 1.3 billion last year, and it must be considered that the cost of a garage would be spaced out over several years. For reference on how many spaces 2000 is, C-2 has 800 spaces in it. It would significantly increase parking capacity to put a garage where a lot like C-11 is. Clemson's parking services have made it clear that they will never build a garage though, no matter how much students want it.\n\nThis brings me to the alternate solutions.  \n\n\n1. Make biking a viable option. In its current state biking is not viable. The sad excuse for bike lanes on highway 93(the road towards central) is not a desirable option. Vehicles going by you inches away at 50 mph. Its not safe. Highway 123 and downtown have sidewalks you could use, but no bike lanes. If you life south of campus its tough luck. For bike lanes to be used they must be recessed from the road and shaded. No one wants to bike for 15 minutes with no shade, radiating heat from the road, next to 2 ton cars going by fast enough to kill them. If Clemson(the town or university) put in bike lanes similar to Hilton Head, it would be a more attractive solution.\n2. More busses. Busses in their current state aren't great. Its good if you don't have a car, but that's about it. Clemson's bus routes opt for a few large busses running the routes instead of many small ones. This means you could be waiting a long time for a bus to pick you up. Ultimately busses are going to be stuck in the same traffic as you, only going slower and stopping constantly. Clemson's current strategy seems to be to make parking so bad that busses are a viable option, instead of making the bus system for off campus students faster. \n3. Remove all the restrictions with the carpool program. In its current state there's so many loops to jump through I just as well not bother doing it.\n4. More on campus housing, and more student housing in walking distance to campus. I don't know if this is true but I heard that the town of Clemson doesn't want any more student housing like campus view near downtown or the neighborhoods surrounding it. Clemson needs more housing in that area and on campus. If students can walk to campus it significantly reduces traffic. \n\nThis is quite a long post, but I believe its needed. I like this university. I make this post hoping that it will better the university and get some ideas and conversations going to try and solve the commuting problem. Just because I'm biased towards keeping parking doesn't mean I'm not open to alternative solutions. I believe its unhealthy to reduce students options instead of building new ones, but I'd be more than happy to bike to campus if it were a viable option. Hopefully this post can serve as a good place for parking discussion, and maybe with enough voices things can change.",

                    "comment": "I partially agree. My whole point is Clemson seems to be doing nothing. No transit reform, no parking reform. They're just removing parking year over year and gesture vaugly at our bad alternatives saying to use them. \n\nPersonal transit is an absolute win imo, whether it's walking, biking, or driving. You get total control over your mobility. That said I'd take catbus if one came that frequently.\n\nI doubt this will change your opinion, but the argument that adding more car infrastructure doesn't work isn't valid for Clemson. It's an argument against urban sprawl. That more lanes incentivizes longer commutes. That argument has some validity(though I disagree with it on some points but that's not relevant). Anyway Clemson has total control over how many people there are here. That argument is for cities that can grow. Clemson could easily cap the student body at a set number. If the student body is capped at like 25k and roughly 5k need parking at any given time, then car infrastructure could be perfected for that. Once it's built for that traffic it will never have to be revized. This is sort of why Europe has less traffic issues(among other things). Their zoning(in general) prevents urban sprawl, so traffic infrastructure doesn't have to change and public transit becomes more logical due to denser cities.\n\nAlso the reason catbus isn't going to become what it should be is because there isn't enough demand. Clemson is incredibly sprawled. Density is what makes public transit make sense and is why it fails in America. We are too sprawled out. A bus has to stop way more times here than in a city to pick up the same amount of passengers. Frequent stops increases ride time. Things can be done to help it, but realize that 70 million is the cost of building it. Upkeep is around half a million a year. That's like the upkeep of 5 new busses and drivers, somewhere in there.\n\nBut seriously I agree we need Clemson to do something instead of just letting it all go downhill.",

Some of your solutions are feasible...some, probably not. If it really is to the point where change must occur and riding it out until you graduate isn't possible, then the vast majority of you (drivers)  must act together. \n\nStage a \"Park-in\".\n\nGet to campus early. Find any open spot and fill it. Employee, commuter, resident, service vehicle, bursar of the month, president, any and all spots...except handicapped and emergency obviously. Bring a snack and/or lunch...doubt you would need supper. Sit in your car and chill. You might be ticketed, but as long as you are in your car you will not be towed. If administration, admissions, faculty, bursar of the month, ombudsman, parking services, visitors, alumni center, etc cannot park...it will be noticed. If questioned by police or parking services, reply \"Fix Clemson's Parking Problem\" and stay in your car. If you need to go pee, have a friend sit in your car while you go.\n\nIf you REALLY want to make a statement... Do it on a Friday night before a game. Make sure there isn't any trespassing potential. \n\nI'm sure y'all could figure out a way to organize this on the DL and make an impact. It will take a large number of you though. Prepare yourselves for backlash from two-leggers, two-wheelers, and goody two-shoes. \n\nY'all have fun and enjoy your stay at Clemson. Nothing like a good ol peaceful protest!\n\nFYI - I myself spent $1000s at parking services during my 7 years of fun.",

I do think that they need to change when they shift to every 30 minutes in the afternoon because not considering 11-2 peak is weird to me, but the thing that would better benefit Red imo is modifying their schedule for peak hours, not only doing every 30 minutes on Fridays, and increasing bus capacity so they can take more people on their current schedule.

Lol. \n\nParking garages are a temporary solution and dangerous- how so? If Clemson limited it's student body then the amount of parking passes needed wouldn't rise, and if they improved alternatives simultaneously it would go down. Garages are dangerous, so is walking downtown late at night or going to a regular parking lot. \n\nStaff parking is definitely a point in this. If the vision of Clemson is to remove cars from campus then trustee park should be car free. I've seen no reduction in all the staff cars on campus, just students.

I don't know why they stopped, probably because it became unreliable. \n\nI agree with more on campus housing, Thorn Hill or whatever is all very sparse and those units are due for retirement sooner than most things on campus, I can't imagine they won't bulk up student living when that happens.   \n\n\nThe solutions that simply add more cars by giving us more parking, garages, and lanes, aren't going to help, like running a highway through Boston didn't fix traffic, or any major city you insert here. So there is some logic to their madness: when you design a walkable, bikeable city, that isn't catered toward cars, everyone wins, in the end.   \n\n\nThey have done things to make it more walkable in the core of campus, the drive in front of Tillman is deliveries only now, it used to be bidirectional and open. It slowed down the busses, which compounded on the issues you spoke about - people less enthused about taking the busses because they had an unreliable pace, you'd get stuck at the corner of Brackett waiting for clearance to turn right. \n\nI don't think there has been any expansion of employee parking in the heart of campus since 2014 at least. Some has been taken away, like when Core was built.   \n\n\nThat said they're going in some wrong directions: Perimeter sucked, but it used to work. Then they slowed the speed limits way down, and now they want to widen the road to 4 lanes. I don't even understand the fucking point of doubling the lanes and halving the speed you will just get twice as many cars in the end doing the same full speed. But whatever, I'm not a traffic engineer. I just hope that it means if you take the Park n Ride that you get more reliable commute times to your meetings and classrooms. If not, the PnR is a waste. If PnR is working smoothly, you could eventually imagine them phasing out the closer lots. Most of Douthuit Hills was resident parking until it was dormitories.",

The university could totally limit the number of students. Boston can't cap their commuting population, so more roads just incentivized more cars. If the student body was limited then they could design traffic infrastructure for that population and it'd work. Most of America is very sprawling, so any implementation of walking and biking is difficult. I firmly believe that traffic and walking cities can coexist. Charlotte is one of the best examples coming to mind. If every other street in their grid was pedestrian I think it would be perfect. More lanes doesn't help with traffic at a point, but more routes does. Bonus if the extra routes are trains/trams/biking. 2 three lane freeways is going to flow better than 1 eight lane one. The ultimate problem with America, and Clemson's public transit is density. Its just not dense enough to make mass transit a viable option. Transit arteries and rezoning is about the best they could do.\n\nI was aware of the Tillman change, and yes busses aren't great because of traffic infrastructure. I wasn't aware employee lots were lost for core, but I still stand by my point that having employee parking at the heart of campus while saying we need to reduce student commuting seems disingenuous.  \n\n\nI'm pretty sure perimeter is for football. Also it serves as a defining ring around campus. A line between what they consider main campus and not. I wish the money went into bike lanes or something though.",

TLDR parking spot changeouts happen too fast in this lot to accurately make sense of, even if they spent the money and took the lot out of service to upgrade the roadway sensors.  The tool was rendered effectively useless because of the wild degree of measurement uncertainty, period. A parking garage can get by on actually having sensors at each spot, ticketed entry and exit, etc. and much more infrastructure and overhead cost.\n\nBut by all means, if you think you can do better, no sass there are programs on campus for student-university outreach on projects. It's literally how the Barn got turned into something useful - some undergrad spoke his mind and the university agreed with their proposals.

            "comment": "Past student, current resident.\n\nOn your alternate solutions, I can talk to what I see from the City of Clemson on those. First and foremost, watching the politics and goals of the City, there is a definite breakdown in aligning behind goals for the University and the City. This leads to a lot of frustrations between the residents and the students. It's unfortunate because it's a symbiotic relationship. City of Clemson would be some small redneck town without the university. And the university, with they way they choose to run it - depends on the city. Such as how the university supplies minimal on campus housing and poor transportation options. They basically stop at the property boundaries. Everything on campus property is their responsibility and the City has to deal with the rest. But the student body size they've elected to support, cannot all fit and live in that boundary making them need the City. \n\nThe city and the residents are push for a bike network. Look up 'The Green Crescent Trail'. It would connect Clemson, Central and Pendelton. As well as Southern Weslyn and TTC. Unfortunately since funding is minimal, it's be very slow going. As far as I can tell, the University seems is making on campus bike lane improvements, but I've heard of no involvement planning or funding wise for off campus development. You know, where the majority of their student body lives.\n\nThe CatBus is funded by the city. It used to be used by the university, but one year the university put their on campus transit up for bid and whoever runs Tiger Transit won out. I know the City was pushing to do things like the double buses and electric buses and maybe that just ended up putting them in with too high of a bid but I don't see why this is not another thing that the city and university really should be working on together. It's sad.\n\nFinally, the housing issue. Oh geez, this is complicated. Overall, as liberal as people can be in a college town, we still live in a conservative area so in politics that means no one can agree and either everything grinds to a halt or all decisions end up being lame. Basically from what I can tell, is Clemson University needed student housing. The City needed residental housing. The developers wanted to buy in on the former because students typically have more money to fund their housing via loans, scholarships and grants and family or personal wealth. Not a lot of people are enrolled in Clemson without some kind of funding. The general population however - I'm sure you've seen all the news stories about how far one can get on an average salary these days. Just Google Average Clemson salary and then average Clemson rent and then do so math and you'll see most households are here live a little thin thanks to rent. There were a couple news stories awhile ago about how most Clemson employees live outside of Clemson because of the lack of housing options. So Clemson politics keeps going back and forth between \"it's a free country property owners can do what they want with their property\" and \"we need to establish something to drive residental housing development and balance that against student housing\". So in all it's a balance they cannot figure out how to strike. Throw into the mix, the university just increases it's numbers with no discussion with the city and it's all now a reactionary rather than a pre planned response. \n\nHopefully that provides some insight. This is all just what I've seen and noticed. So this is all perception. The [City of Clemson](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100065051971584) has a FB page that's worth following for events and insight. As well as [Mayor Robert Halfacre](https://www.facebook.com/HalfacreforClemson). They also post a lot of stuff to their [website](https://www.clemsoncity.org/) - way more than most little towns I see post to their websites, including their [quarterly](https://www.clemsoncity.org/OurCommunity/CommunityConnection/tabid/300/Default.aspx).\n\nAll in all, it really sucks that there is not a better relationship between the City and the University. It seems the City tries, but there is still some animosity from some residents. And the university - they seem to do the bare minimum to claim their 'Town and Gown' award - which supposedly, doesn't take much more that a survey or the students trending well. No input from \"the town\".\n\nHope all that was at least a little educational and provided some interesting reads.",

            "comment": "The city of Clemson and Central have had conversation about increasing bike infrastructure. Look up Green Crescent Trail. It is a network of proposed bike lanes. As someone that has been hit by a car on 93 I totally agree with you on safety. 93 needs to lose a car lane and create a bus/bike only lane. This is used in metro areas like DC and ATL with much success.\n\nI think your lack of willingness to use the bus system is the root of your own problem. The red route going through Central touches many it not all of the major apartment complexes. Do you have to leave an hour before your class, yes. But it also functional time. You can study or read or etc while someone else drives you. It saves a significant amount of cash.\n\nClemson should only invest in mass public transit options and expanding sustainable options like cycling.",

If you eliminate the need for private shuttles from farther developments and add a couple more buses to keep a consistent schedule, catbus could easily handle clemson\u2019s parking problem.\n\nThe main issue with this is catbus is a city-owned system, not a university owned system.",

On the bus route but also walkable to campus and downtown.  Looks like they may be owned now by Orange Property Management, so give them a call. I\u2019d also suggest looking into some of the smaller property management companies (I don\u2019t recommend Tiger properties at all) and call and see what they may have available that isnt posted on their websites. I never lived in an apartment managed by Burton Properties but they were incredibly helpful when I was looking for housing and very kind and I\u2019ve heard good things about them.",

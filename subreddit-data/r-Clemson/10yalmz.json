Now that things are back to normal, is there a reason why the hours are still so short compared to before? \n\nEven last semester the library was open till 11, and now it closes at 10. \n\nAnderson University even stays open till midnight. Is it a budget issue, or the leak?",

It was always there, always open, always available for any one who needed a reprieve. \n\nLike so many other resources we count on, it shouldn\u2019t be about whether a lot of people want it at the same time, it should just be there when needed.\n\nOf all the extravagant funds the school spends and brings in from Tuition hikes, cutting costs at The Library seems like a huge misallocation of resources.",

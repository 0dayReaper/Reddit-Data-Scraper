I can't login to a virtual desktop through my work computer. \n\n\nGetting those proof documents requires:\n\n1. Log in to Citrix on personal computer\n\n2. Log in to iRoar within Citrix \n\n3. Use links in the validation page to get to the homepage for iRoar. Honestly, this is the most embarrassing element of this process for Clemson.\n\n3. Save pdf copies &amp; exit session\n\n4. Open email on personal computer &amp; send files\n\n5. Use work computer to submit docs\n\n\nGotta be honest, I would not recommend Clemson to peers just because of these IT issues.",

Every Wednesday at 7pm EDT (UTC \u22124:00 hours) I have an interactive live stream on general chemistry topics.\n\nStressed about the upcoming AP exam? This week we are working AP exam problems on electrochemistry. We will calculate E\u2070cell, Keq and \u0394G. We will also sketch out an electrochemical cell showing the flow of electrons and ions. However, all students are welcome to join- these are topics that are covered in other chemistry classes as well. Feel free to ask questions in the chat and request other chemistry topics/problems for future live streams.\n\nI was a college professor for ten years, so I know where students often get stuck or confused. The YouTube channel is Chem Help ASAP ([https://www.youtube.com/c/ChemHelpASAP](https://www.youtube.com/c/ChemHelpASAP)). I hope I can help you with your chemistry classes!",

    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming freshman\u2014business major in the honors college. I\u2019ve heard that Douthit is a really nice dorm, CUBS is there, and I\u2019ve eaten in that dining hall and enjoyed the food so I would love to live there. However, all of the possible roomates I\u2019m talking to are dead set on living in honors. Is Douthit significantly better than honors or are they like the same? (without taking cost into consideration). I\u2019d love some brutally honest reviews of both and opinions!",

Both are great options and come with their pros and cons. If I did it all over again I would 10/10 pick Deschamps again, especially since you\u2019re pretty much guaranteed a room with the honors priority.\n\nEdit- forgot to mention douthit has some THIN walls, like I\u2019m talking i hear my suitemates conversations from his room.",

So you might get stuck in the Shoeboxes or Bryan Mall and then wished you had just picked the honors dorms.",

Parking situation for visitors was a nightmare and if you have people living above your apartment you\u2019d better pray they walk light and don\u2019t party.",

Everyone has been pretty cool and relaxed. Rooms/bathrooms are very nicely sized. Kitchens and living spaces are decent. Very rarely you'll hear a big outdoor party down the street or something, but I've never had any issues. The roads suck. Very close to downtown and campus.",

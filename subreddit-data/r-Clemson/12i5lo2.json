    "postText": "Hi all! My friend is planning to be out of town this summer, so she's looking for someone to sublease her townhome at The Cottages of Clemson from May 9 until July 22. There's an option to renew for the school year too! She doesn't have reddit so I'm posting for her. The rooms, bathroom, and walk-in closet are super spacious and the townhome is pet friendly. The 1b1b room comes with the furniture package which includes a desk, a bed and bed frame, two dressers, and a night table. There is also an in-unit laundry machine with a washer and dryer. The rent is $705 including the furniture package (which is $40, but you can opt out of the package if you want) and the utilities are not included.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!

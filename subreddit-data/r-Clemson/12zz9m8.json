    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019m attending Clemson this year for English. I\u2019m a bit confused on how housing works.\n\nI have read up on each of the dorm locations and am primarily interested in Mickel and Holmes (honestly anything but the shoeboxes). I want to be in a suite with a bathroom. \n\nI applied for the connections LLC because it said after the honors kids, they have their picks of dorms.\n\nMy question is since I\u2019ve chosen an LLC, do I have to live in the location of whatever that LLC is? Should I just not choose an LLC and hope to get placed somewhere else more preferable for housing?",

I think connect is in Holmes, but you can\u2019t be in connect and live in Mickel, douthit, etc. Some LLCs also may require you to take classes/do activities specifically with your LLC, so be prepared for that.\n\nI didn\u2019t live in an LLC and was able to get a suite style easily my freshman year. Again, since RISE is moving to Mickel, I wouldn\u2019t bet on getting it. But Holmes and McCabe are both good options that should not be difficult to get, especially if you get a good time slot. I hope this helped!",

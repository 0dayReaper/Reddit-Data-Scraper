Right now I'm enrolled in 16 credit hours and I think that it costs me around $7,000 (before board, food, and so forth). I don't have any LIFE or other scholarship.\n\nHas anyone taken summer classes, and how much did it cost you?",

Basically depends if you're in state or out of state and some specific classes will have additional charges.",

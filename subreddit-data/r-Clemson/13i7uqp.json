She assigns a lot of work but it\u2019s something you can sit down and do in an hour, even the tests and allowing time to teach yourself the material too.",

All of the work is done digitally and can be done ahead of class. It might be worth it to go to meet others I'm case you have questions you can reach out, but it's a pretty easy class",

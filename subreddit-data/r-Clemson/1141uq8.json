    "postText": "Whats up guys! Me and a team of about 5 other students are working to bring a music festival to clemson this spring through a competition called the Up &amp; Up Music Festival. Were competing against 60 other schools in the US to see who can buy the most pre-sale tickets within the next 24 hours. We're currently in 6th place and the top 6 teams win! Your card will only be charged if we win and the headliner is EDM artist Chris Lorenzo. Even if youre not into the type of music being played, we will have food vendors and alcohol vendors on site so it should be fun for everybody if we manage to win!\n\nA link to buy tickets and look at more info: [https://store.upandupfestival.com/products/bring-chris-lorenzo-to-clemson](https://store.upandupfestival.com/products/bring-chris-lorenzo-to-clemson)\n\nHeres a link to our instagram: [https://www.instagram.com/upandupclemson/](https://www.instagram.com/upandupclemson/)",

    "postText": "Hi! I am a photographer that is based in central Virginia. I am currently attending Clemson for grad school and would like to offer senior portraits down here but I don't know where to advertise this. I don't want to change my google business address since I am still based out of Virginia but I don't know how else I would pop up when people are searching for a photographer. I feel like the best option would be to get them by word of mouth but I do not know that many people. Does anyone have any ideas on where I could post? Thanks!\n\n[my website](https://www.caseylee.photography/seniors)",

It looks a bit more relaxed now. \n\nhttps://www.clemson.edu/public/scbg/events/book-your-event.html\n\nFor the city of Clemson I would contact the business license office if you choose to shoot in city limits. I really don\u2019t know if you need one, but I\u2019ve heard the city can be particular. \n\nhttps://www.clemsoncity.org/Departments/Administration/BusinessLicenses/tabid/243/Default.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1\n\nI will add, I\u2019ve never done either. I just remember my photography complaining about what was necessary to have our wedding pictures taken years ago. Hopefully they have relaxed a bit.",

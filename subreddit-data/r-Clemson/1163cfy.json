The landlords are fair, pleasant to deal with, and come when called for issues\u2014my only caveat is that I haven't rented from them since '07. So take my words with a grain of salt.  \n\n\nSome of their older properties, like Heritage Pointe, look a little dated on the inside (i have been inside one in the last few years), but they take care of them.  \n\n\n$675/mo seems like a lot for a college kid, but i know zero of your situation.",

You\u2019d be surprised how many students (or perhaps their parents) are paying between $800-$1200 per month for a *bedroom* (meaning the property company is making $3000-4000 per 4 bedroom apartment). It\u2019s gotten ridiculous.\n\nMy rent at Tiger Towne Village was $455/mo for a bedroom in 2019 and $600/mo by the time I left in 2021.",

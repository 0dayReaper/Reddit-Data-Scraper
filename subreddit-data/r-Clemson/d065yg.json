The people who could do something about it don't care because they can park right by where they need to be.  Find the right people and do a sit in on the spots they're allowed to park in, see how long they put up with parking on the other side of the city.",

Tbh, parking is never full on the other side of the stadium and students still have access to CATbus from there. I dont know what good the parking garage others have mentioned would do. It would still be a fair distance from main campus and require a ride on the CATbus anyways. No one has been able to come up with a good spot for the parking garage where there aren't usually open spots anyways.\n\nEdit: maybe it would be a good idea to stop spending a half hour or 45 minutes looking for a spot in the middle of campus if your first class isn't until mid day. Of course the lots closer to campus are going to be full by then. Accept that those fill up first, save your time and park farther away. You're all acting like taking a half hour to get from your parking spot to your class is going to kill you.",

This is especially frustrating when parking services cares more about someone parking in a restricted spot for an hour than 3 trailers taking up a bunch of spots for an entire 3 days.",

The bus at my apartment complex is supposed to arrive at :10 :40 :25 :55 but instead they have frequently arrived at +- 10 minutes.\n2. They're not effectively tracked on my.clemson's bus tracker. Some bus routes don't even show up so it's literally not possible to know if the bus is running even though it *should* be.\n3. The bus that I can take from my apartment drops me off across the entire campus from where my class buildings are. It's still a 10+ minute walk from the nearest bus stop vs a 5 (or less) minute walk from the parking lot.\n4. If I miss my stop for whatever reason, the next stop on the route would be in the middle of Central and takes atleast 30 minutes to get back to that same stop again. \n\nIf I'm going to start relying on a bus service to get places, they need to start acting like they are infrastructure instead of a commodity.",

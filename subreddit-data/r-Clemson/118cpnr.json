    "postText": "Found this interview of Cade Klubnik that's actually pretty interesting. I haven't learned much about Cade as he seems pretty scripted in the few post-game interviews I've seen of him. Getting to know who he is off the field + his mindset and how he approaches the game gives me hope for next season! Plus, his 'welcome to college football moment' when Myles Murphy sacked him is hilarious. \ud83d\ude02\n\nLink: [https://youtube.com/watch?v=ImrR9IkhFrg&amp;si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ImrR9IkhFrg&amp;si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE)",

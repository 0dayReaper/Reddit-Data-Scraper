It\u2019s basically watered-down discrete mathematics as it pertains to data structures. \n\nJust got out of my 3rd exam in Dr. Widman\u2019s section, and it was a breeze if you put in the work. If he\u2019s teaching the summer course, take him for sure.",

I\u2019m in Widman\u2019s 2070 now, I did well in the first module on prop logic/quantifying predicates. We\u2019re in the second module which is number/set theory, functions, and sums. This module seems way harder than the first.\n\nWhen you took the course, which module did you consider to be the most rigorous?",

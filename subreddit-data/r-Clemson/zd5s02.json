Does anyone have a stole they\u2019d be willing to sell to me? I\u2019d pay full price and shipping! I\u2019m honestly desperate at this point and really would like one for my graduation this month!!",

Distribution hours are 9:00am until 5:00 today through Thursday (Hendrix Peebles room) and then it's only a few hours Friday morning.(Meeting Room A).",

    "postText": "Every time I get a new professor and move up in this department it seems like the professors get worse and worse and consistently try and make the class hard for no reason. I ask all the others taking the classes before me and it just seems like there are no favorites or any \"good\" professors anyone can recommend. I understand this is a research school and most aren't really paid to teach us but it feels like this is one of the current departments that's tanking overall.\n\nI talk to many other people in engineering, business, marketing, etc. and they all seem happy and talk so highly of their professors. If you come to comp sci and CIS all you hear is \"here's the professors you should avoid.\"",

I feel like the overall quality is about as good as any other school, just a mixed bag. \n\nThe department itself, however, is a different story. The management has been suffering budget cuts that aren\u2019t set to be resolved until next year at the earliest.",

Then I stepped into 2310 and I find that most of the topics aren\u2019t useful or are made purposefully difficult for students to follow along. \n\nI have had my share of great professors such as Subs, Russell, and Widman. But it starting to seem the dept is hiring anyone they can dig up and the professors currently in can make your life hell because you have few options and they are all you\u2019ve got. I\u2019m now a senior and still struggling for them to even assign me a faculty advisor. I do hope that before I graduate or even after the program picks back up to what it was supposed to be when I transferred here. \n\nI had everyone telling me it was an amazing program, great professors, well funded, etc. Then I got here and feel like my previous UNI might have had a before program, even if it was just starting and not highly ranked.",

I\u2019ve worked with morons from ivy leagues and wizards from state schools.\n\nGet the degree, leetcode, and learn what you need on the job.\n\nThat being said: lazy and/or unnecessarily difficult classes are the worst and I\u2019m sorry if you\u2019re dealing with that.",

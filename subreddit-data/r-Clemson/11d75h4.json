Trust me in years from now - this will not mean a thing.... make a $65 gift donation to someone you see in need ... a free meal or get yourself a great dinner .... Honors College has no stole- it is only ODK anyway... I wouldn't think abt it anymore buy yourself or your grandparent or parent an honor/ thank you gift instead! They're probably more than $75 now-- you have an inner stole you worked for, no can take that from you &amp; God knows you've paid a fortune for it already",

I got messages- I had just had this deadline drilled to before was why it was funny- I upvoted you! As is everything frustrating abt clemson- just nonsense / $ and more money that she/he shouldn't be worrying about",

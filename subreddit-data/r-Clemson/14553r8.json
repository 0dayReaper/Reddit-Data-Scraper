Thank you.",

The most reliable source would be iRoar, but that\u2019s only available to admitted students.\n\nAlmost all 1000 and 2000 level classes are offered every semester. Most 3000 level classes are as well. 4000 levels become hit or miss. \n\nYour best bet for more info is likely the Clemson CPSC discord server or the syllabus repository (findable on google).",

My major was related but I never took any forestry specific classes. If anyone has any old textbooks or has any book/online/other resources they recommend, please leave them below! Thanks :)",

While I can\u2019t vouch for *all* forestry related courses, I\u2019d recommend investing in a [Dendrology Tree Identification Book](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/native-trees-of-the-southeast-l-katherine-kirkman/1100001723?ean=9780881928280). Also, there are other helpful [Winter Tree Identification Guides](https://libraries.clemson.edu/press/books/winter-tree-identification-for-the-southern-appalachians-and-piedmont/) that can assist when leaves aren\u2019t present.\n\nHope that helps! (Again, both of the recommended guides assume that you\u2019re employed in the Southeast)",

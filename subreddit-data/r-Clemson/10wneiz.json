    "postText": "Hello all, I am a student at Clemson and I have lost my Bluetooth headset on Campus this past Thursday. I either lost them in Cooper Library or Lee Hall and I have checked the lost and founds at both locations and they were not there. I don\u2019t know what to do and I am really hoping that they were not stolen. They were expensive and I cannot afford to replace them. I did not mean to lose them, I had a long day and I was exhausted, so unfortunately, I was not thinking straight. I really wish I hadn\u2019t lost them because they meant a lot to me.",

I left them on one of the tall tables by the Gantt gallery before going to my last class for the day that was at 5pm-7:45pm. I don\u2019t know if a custodian picked them up or if someone decided to keep them. Thing is, I have the charging cord which is magnetic, so you can\u2019t charge them without it once they die.",

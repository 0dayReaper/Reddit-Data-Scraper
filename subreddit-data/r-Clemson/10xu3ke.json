You want to have fraternities? Let it be it\u2019s own entity, no special on campus dorms for them, they have frat houses and you can join them, but the university makes it clear that it\u2019s a do at your risk and abide by the law.\n\nCollege kids are going to act like college kids, but parents and the university needs to quit putting their stamp of approval on something that\u2019s shown time and time again not to have any regard for human safety.",

    "postText": "Have a room at the Lofts (4br/4ba). Fully Furnished. Graduated early so don\u2019t need it. Lease was signed in early September last year, so it\u2019s $725/mo (avg is 800+). I will also pay for the entire month of January. Move in date would be start of January. I have a parking pass good through July 31 that is also included.\n\nClose to campus. Easily in walking distance. 3 other male roommates. Good guys who are friendly/considerate. Have had no issues with taking out trash, being loud late at night, etc. Msg me if you\u2019re interested.",

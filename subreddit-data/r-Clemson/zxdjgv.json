            "comment": "Hi! Former instructor here. I would strongly recommend reaching out to the professor directly via email (though they and many other university staff will likely be on winter break, so response times could be delayed). Course listings usually have to be finalized a decent ways in advance, but \u201chybrid\u201d could encompass a variety of different things. There\u2019s a good deal of variation in methods \u2014 the hybrid courses I taught had options for online OR in-person attendance for every class session, but there are other courses where hybrid means some class sessions are in-person and others are online. (Example: At least last spring, Calc 2 met in-person MTF and online Th, so it was considered hybrid.) So the Greenville location may imply that some class sessions are in-person.\n\nThe instructor can best inform you of their modality plans for the class. They might not have their syllabus finalized, but they should at least be able to give you a general idea. :)",

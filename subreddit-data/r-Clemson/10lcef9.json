Pizza was actually pretty decent.  Loose change opened around that time I think if memory serves.  TDs and TTT were the busiest and then Bad Apple opened.  It\u2019s fun to hear about those bars.  Got into plenty of adventures\u2026",

We couldn't get into a couple packed bars, but walked right in to Loose Change and got a table for four facing the TVs. We remarked how empty it was at kickoff, but by the end of the first quarter, all the table were full. I consider this a POSITIVE.\n\nThe servers were really on point too. Another positive aspect of this smaller, slower place. They can focus on your needs. BTW, the BLT sandwiches are very good.",

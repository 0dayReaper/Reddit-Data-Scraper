As AI develops it will encompass most data entry positions including those of the bean counters. Tech positions will be most effected already mobile apps are stripping away the need of fast food employees. In a future coming quickly 80% of jobs created by computers for the last 50 years will be eliminated by AI.",

If you wanna work big 4 then do accounting but if you wanna work in investment banking, trading, corporate finance then it makes more sense to do a dual degree in finance and comp sci. \n\nPlus financial Mgt already comes with accounting minor. I would causation against doing a double major with accounting.",

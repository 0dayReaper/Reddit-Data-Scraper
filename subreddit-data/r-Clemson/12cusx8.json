    "postText": "Hello Clemson gen chem students! I am offering free chemistry help for general chemistry students via YouTube. Every Wednesday at 7pm EDT (UTC \u22124:00 hours) I have an interactive live stream on general chemistry topics.\n\nThis week we are working 5 buffer problems. We will calculate the pH of various buffers as well as buffer capacity. Feel free to ask questions in the chat and request other chemistry topics/problems for future live streams.\n\nI was a college professor for ten years, so I know where students often get stuck or confused. The YouTube channel is Chem Help ASAP ([https://www.youtube.com/c/ChemHelpASAP](https://www.youtube.com/c/ChemHelpASAP)). I hope I can help you with your chemistry classes!",

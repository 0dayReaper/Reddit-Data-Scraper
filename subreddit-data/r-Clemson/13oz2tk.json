    "postText": "I'm looking at the options for traveling to Clemson for this summer's graduation, and I'm hoping to get some advice from other people who had made the trip.\n\nI'll be coming from Cleveland, Ohio. I can fly into the Greenville-Spartanburg airport, but I'm not sure of the best way to get from there to the campus / hotel.  My research shows that there is a shuttle, but I'm not sure it will be actively running in August.\n\nI'm hoping to book a hotel near campus -- it would be ideal if it were close enough to walk to the graduation ceremony so that I don't have to rent a car and deal with parking it on campus.\n\nI'm pretty open to different ideas, but I'm not sure how to do this in an economical fashion.",

The Abernathy hotel is about two blocks from graduation (in Littlejohn coliseum) if it\u2019s still available. The next closet hotel is the Shepard hotel downtown. Still not far. All other hotels I would expect to Uber. Good luck!",

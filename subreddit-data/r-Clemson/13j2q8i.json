    "postText": "Hi! Me and my 2 other roommates have a 4 bedroom apartment under lease this upcoming school year and are looking for a 4th roommate! I am a CIS major, roommate 1 is a finance, roommate 2 is Political Science. We like to go out and throw house parties with our friends and be active through the week. Only 2 of us really cook in the apartment. We want to keep it clean! Also we have all of our living room furniture handled. Reach out and we can talk!",

I did a gravely voice like Wolfman Jack during my speaking segments because I wanted to do something different. I didn\u2019t know who Wolfman was at the time so it was pretty cool when my dad told me about him. \n\nThe WSBF team was so much fun. Absolutely my favorite memories are with all of them. Having great parties and putting on shows. The most infamous being the annual box wine formal. I hope they still do it! u/WSBF_FM_CLEMSON",

At the last one I ended up talking to a dragon in a tree at the Rooplex. Good times. I still listen to all those songs regularly. It was a very formative time for me. Reach out any time!",

    "postText": "I've been scouring all of the general apartment search websites and it has been hard to differentiate between student and non-student rentals. I'm planning on moving closer to Clemson area as I work for the university and am currently in the Greenville area. My current lease is up July 31 and I will be living alone. Requirements:\n\n1. Rent no more than 950.00 total monthly, before utilities\n2. Cat friendly\n3. Washer and Dryer included\n\nI would prefer a two bedroom, but realize that with the current climate this may not be possible. Anyone have any ideas? Is there anyone I can contact that would be able to assist in my search?",

If you\u2019re trying to avoid student living communities, you\u2019re gonna have a rough time finding a lease in the summer. Unless you privately rent a house or something. Most major living communities are majority students. My best recommendation is choose one that\u2019s not a hotspot for apartment parties (so not any places DT, or a place like Epoch, Grandmarc, etc..). As I type this, I think a good option to check out would be Harts Cove, which is by Epoch, as that is a relatively quiet place imo",

It looks like the current rate is 1050/mo (plus we had a 30/mo pet fee) so a bit higher than you were wanting but it includes water, trash and when I lived there for 3 years I never saw a rent increase.",

It\u2019s a 2 bed/2 bath, and they said new rent would be $1075/mo though you might want to double check with them (cats are additional $75/mo/cat, no dogs allowed). It\u2019s a top corner unit, so nice and quiet. Appliances are admittedly old (maybe why my unit is cheaper?) but everything works and maintenance is fast.",

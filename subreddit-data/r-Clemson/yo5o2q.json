    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI have a sublease available for the spring semester (1/1 thru 7/31) at Crawford Falls.  It is a private bed/bath in a 4BR apartment with 3 other roommates (all male).  Price is negotiable (I can cut you a check for the difference), but the base rent is $585+utilities, and I also have furniture I can throw in if you need furnishings.  The common living space is also furnished.  Please let me know if interested, we're very laid back and most of us are senior engineering students just coasting by on our last semesters.",

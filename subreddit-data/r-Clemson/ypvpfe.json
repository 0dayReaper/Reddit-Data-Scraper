I set up a roomsurf and I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a good Facebook group or anything like that to find other people in my situation to find a good roommate for next year and hopefully make a friend. Any advice would be helpful.",

However you try and do it, try and find housing now it becomes a cluster fuck the longer you wait because there is a shortage of housing here so try and decide sooner rather than later. If you can\u2019t find anyone you could also always just choose the housing place you like and get assigned a random roommate.",

These semesters typically last 15 weeks (16 if exam week is included)\n\n Maymester is pretty short and only offers a few 1 credit courses (I may be wrong about this). The summer semesters offer only a few of the courses offered in the Fall or Spring. Which courses those are depends on the department and the faculty teaching those courses. Note that summer semesters work on an accelerated schedule (5 weeks) and cover the same material as Fall or Spring courses.\n\nSummer courses are usually taken by students looking to get ahead (or even catch up a bit if they have done co-ops) or maybe up their grades to keep a scholarship among other reasons. They are not mandatory.\n\nTLDR: Summer courses are available, but they are limited and are not required to be taken, which means one does get to have a summer break if one chooses.",

Of course, you can see that at registration and your academic advisor can also help with that. FYI though, summer classes can be more costly than Fall/Spring classes, since you can't take (nor is it recommended if you can) enough classes to be considered a full time student.",

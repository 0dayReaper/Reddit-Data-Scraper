    "postText": "Hello everyone\n\nSo I finally graduated, I did a co-op so it took me a bit longer than most, but thankful to say I'm done. However, throughout the past 5 years I've done a good bit of hiking around here, mostly waterfalls but some others as well. I wanted to share all the trails I remember and give a brief description and what I thought about each of them. All of these trails are accessible on AllTrails if you wanted to read more and get directions. Just a side note, this is my opinion so there could be a trail that I thought was terrible that you may like, who knows. I also have taken my dog on every single one of these and he's a 80 lb chungus so if he can do it so can your dog more than likely. Anyways, on to the neature:\n\n**Trail Name (Length of trail, Estimated drive time to trailhead)**\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Clemson Experimental Forest (Vary in length, &lt;15 min drive):** While this is kind of a given, the Exp. Forest is actually a really cool place to go hike, wander, get lost, etc. It has a lot of streams, well kept trails, and some decent views. For how close it is to campus you can't beat it. Check out the Red, Gray, and Green loops, they were pretty good.\n\n**Raven Rock Loop (4.2 mi, 30 min):** Had a pretty cool rock that you could sit on that overlooks the lake but in my opinion wasn't really worth the hike there. You're pretty much constantly going up and down, and I wouldn't say the hike there made me ever want to do it again. I will say though that there are spots for camping that you can reserve if that's what you're into and I think it would be a really cool place to camp for the night.\n\n**Rocky Bald and Cedar Rock (4.0 mi, 34 min):** Definitely a good hike if you find you have nothing to do one day on the weekend and want to get outside. Not hard enough to warrant planing for it, but also not easy enough to be done in under an hour. Use the directions and reviews on AllTrails and it'll take you to the top of a lower mountain and then a bald patch of rock which overlooks the valley below. Trail also goes by some streams and stuff and is all around pretty enjoyable.\n\n**Hidden Falls (5.1 mi, 46 min):** Out of all of the trails on this list, this is the one I honestly liked the least. The trail was pretty mundane, and the falls at the end I liked the least out of any on this list. Given that it's a 5ish mile hike, I'd say the hike there wasn't really worth it. \n\n**Issaqueena Falls (0.3 mi, 37 min):** Not necessarily a hike but I'd thought I'd put it on here nonetheless. Falls are definitely cool and you can get real close up to them. Plus its a fun scramble down to the bottom to get closer as well. Once I was done we went into Stumphouse Tunnel which was cool, and you can explore around there as well. Plenty of other trails that are by these falls so you have some options.\n\n**Yellow Branch Falls (3.0 mi, 36 min):** All and all, this is one of my favorite hikes and waterfalls around here. It's relatively close, the waterfall is great, and the hike is entertaining as well. This is one of my must-do's if you want to see waterfalls in this area.\n\n**Lee Falls (2.9 mi, 42 min):** Following that up is one of, if not my favorite set of falls that I've done while being at Clemson. The hike is really interesting and takes you through some fields in the forest, then cuts through some streams, and patches of mountain laurel along said streams. When you get to the falls you can scramble as far up as you want to and the trail pretty much ends but go up as far as you want. Will say though, wear shoes with good traction and wear bug spray.\n\n**Twin Falls on Reedy Cove Creek (2.3 mi, 41 min):** Shorter hike to a set of falls that fall onto rock at the bottom. You can keep going past the overlook again and climb up to the top which was definitely cool. Shorter hike but fun if you connect it with other ones that may be in the area.\n\n**Riley Moore Falls (1.9 mi, 46 min):** This was one of the only true swimming holes that I went to. The falls aren't crazy nice but there's a large sandy patch next to the water like a beach, and there's plenty of space in the water to go swimming and stuff. Will say though this is a really popular spot and can get busy so be prepared for other people.\n\n**Brasstown Falls (0.6 mi, 54 min):** Pretty much a scramble all the way down to the series of falls. There are multiple set of falls which is unique to just this section, but the trail's pretty short and there's no good places to swim or anything. If you're in the area check it out but don't go here expecting a long hike or anything.\n\n**Long Creek Falls (3.3 mi, 1hr3):** This is the furthest that I ever drove for a waterfall but it was certainly worth it. The road back is kind of long and is on gravel so just a fair warning, but the trail is generally easy up until the very end where it drops ~200 ft in about 1/4 mile. However, once you get there the falls are great and there's plenty of space to go swimming in an area around, plus a small beach on the other side of the water. Would definitely bring swimming clothes because this would be a place you can spend a number of hours and be plenty fine. Just remember you have to go back up that decline so save some energy because it'll kick your ass, trust me. Side note: Clayton, GA is about 30 min away and if you have some time, go check it out, it's a cool town and my friends and I always went there to get a beer after we were done.\n\n**Table Rock (6.4 mi, 43 min):** I bet you're asking yourself,\"Damn does this guy ever do anything other than waterfalls?\" Well finally we get around to the trails that aren't waterfalls. Table Rock is the trail that it feels like every Clemson person does at some point, and to be fair, I think everyone should as well. With that being said, prepare yourself because if you haven't hiked before, get ready for a long ass day. It is a hell of a hike and getting to the top is no small thing so make sure you bring more water than you think you need, as well as a sandwich or some food for the top. The first half is pretty much all continually going up, and when you finally reach flat-ish ground, you're only half way there. What lies ahead is another 1-2 miles of going up and down, and then scrambling towards the end to reach the summit. Also, when you think you made it the first time, you're wrong, more thank likely you've made it to the Governor's Rock and have another 0.5-0.6 miles left. Keep going all the way until you walk through an open space of bald rock with moss and stuff growing on the rock. When you come to an open spot of rock overlooking a lake below you, congrats you've done it and made it to the top. Now take your pictures, eat some food, and be happy because going down is much easier.\n\n**Sassafras Mountain (8.2 mi, 48 min):** While Table Rock has a hell of a reputation about it being really hard, I think this one might be tougher. Sassafras Mtn is the highest point in SC and pretty much splits SC and NC. This trails is not for the faint of heart as well because you never really get much of a break for the whole 4-5 miles you're going to the top. The elevation gain between Table Rock and Sassafras are almost equal but at least this one is spread out over a longer span. It's a rewarding hike that takes you through different kinds of forest, and at the top you get a great 360 view of all of the land around you. I'd say this is another one that every one should try if they're able because it can be done in a day and is a good workout at the least.\n\n**Pinnacle Mountain (7.2 mi, 45 min):** My friend and I did this recently and it was a really great hike. You don't see as many people as you would on Table Rock just because I don't think a lot of people know about it. You start at the same place as you would for Table Rock but at the first fork in the trail you follow the signs for Pinnacle. It's got a lot of nice small waterfalls you walk under, streams, and some cool views along the way. To be honest this hike is pretty moderate if you just wanted to hike to the Bald Rock patch which isn't the end but is pretty close to the summit. If you want to keep going though, the last 0.25-0.5 miles are definitely what make this trail harder. The summit doesn't really have a nice view or anything and just has a sign that says summit in the middle of the forest. We got to the summit, caught our breath, and then went down to eat and have a drink at Bald Rock. If you don't really care about getting to the top of say just stop at Bald Rock and take your break because the summit isn't anything you really need to see.\n\n**Rainbow and Turtleback Falls (4.2 mi, 1hr5min):** This one isn't in SC and is a bit further but I'd say well worth the drive out there. It's a really well maintained trail and is definitely a easy to moderate hike. You walk down quite a ways into Gorges Park and then come to a set of pretty \"calm\" rapids where you can explore and jump around on some rocks if you want (don't be an idiot tho, if you get swept away and hurt yourself it's not on me). A little further up is Rainbow Falls which sadly it doesn't look like you can get very close to due to the number of people who have slipped and gotten carried away. Keep going up from Rainbow you come to Turtleback Falls which you can definitely get a lot closer to and is a really impressive waterfall, might be one of the widest ones on this whole entire list. However, like earlier be careful and don't slip. You can keep going on and come to a campsite along the river which is where I stopped to eat and have a drink. If you're gonna do just this one, that's perfectly fine, but I'd make a day out of it and go to Whitewater Falls as well which is right down the road.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI hope this is helpful to anyone wanting to get outside and hike a bit more. I started sophomore /junior year and there's certainly a lot to explore around here so get out and start wandering. If you're more into backpacking and stuff like that, check out the Foothills or Palmetto Trails which are much much longer. Have a good day everyone and happy exploring.\n\nEdit: I added some that I did the past few weeks to the list",

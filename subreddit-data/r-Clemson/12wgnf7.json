    "postText": "I was overridden into a language course at the 3000s level by a professor because I took the language in high school and had a evaluation/comprehensibility meeting with the professor. I\u2019m about to receive an A in the course, so does that mean that I will receive the backlogged credits from the prerequisite german courses, as if I had taken an AP exam? If not automatically, would I receive them if I asked the university?",
